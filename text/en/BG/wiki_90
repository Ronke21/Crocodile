== Life and career ==
=== 1971–1989: Early life and career beginnings ===
Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga was born on February 22, 1971 to Maria Ligaya Alcantara Imutan (b. 1937) and Feliciano Genuino Salonga, Jr. (1929–2016). She has a younger brother named Gerard. At age three, she was trained by her aunt in singing. At age six, she and her family relocated from Angeles City to Quezon City, then later San Juan.

As a child, Salonga began singing at family parties. Her cousin, who was active with Repertory Philippines, encouraged her to audition for a production of &quot;The King and I&quot;, where she made her professional debut in 1978 at the age of seven. She played the title role in &quot;Annie&quot; in 1980, later reprising the role in 1984, and appeared in other productions such as &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1978), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1978), &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1980), &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1980), &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (1982), &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; (1988).

In 1981, Salonga released her first album, &quot;Small Voice&quot;, which was certified gold in the Philippines, and made her film debut in the comedy film &quot;Tropang Bulilit&quot;. As a young performer, Salonga received a Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) award nomination for Best Child Actress and three Aliw Awards for Best Child Performer in 1980, 1981, and 1982. From 1983 to 1985, she hosted her musical television show, &quot;Love, Lea&quot;, and was a member of the cast of German Moreno&#x27;s teen variety show, &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;.

In 1985, Salonga and her brother, Gerard, took part in the 8th Metro Manila Popular Music Festival as the interpreters for the song entry titled &quot;Musika, Lata, Sipol at La La La,&quot; composed by Tess Concepcion, which won second prize in the Amateur Division. That same year, she opened for the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo in their concerts in Manila. She again performed with the group in 1986 and 1987, also appearing on their English-Tagalog album, &quot;In Action&quot;. As a teenager, Salonga continued to act in films, appearing in &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; (1985), &quot;Ninja Kids&quot; (1986), &quot;Captain Barbell&quot; (1986), and &quot;Pik Pak Boom&quot; (1988). In early 1986, 14-year-old Salonga was noted to be attending KBL campaign sorties alongside other celebrities for the reelection of president Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 snap election.

In 1988, she released her second studio album, &quot;Lea&quot;, and opened for Stevie Wonder in Manila. She finished her primary and secondary education as salutatorian and valedictorian, respectively, at Operation Brotherhood (OB) Montessori Center before continuing on a pre-medical track at Ateneo de Manila University.

===1989–1992: &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot;===

In 1989, Salonga originated the leading role of Kim in the debut production of the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; in London. For her initial Manila audition in 1988, the then 17-year-old Salonga chose to sing Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schönberg&#x27;s &quot;On My Own&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Salonga has sometimes credited the song as the starting point of her international career. After hearing her rendition, she was asked if she had prepared another song to perform. Although she had not prepared another song for the audition, she sang &quot;The Greatest Love of All.&quot; At her first callback audition, Salonga was asked to sing &quot;Sun and Moon&quot; and &quot;The Movie in My Mind,&quot; impressing the audition panel. In December 1988, Salonga appeared before the panel at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London to perform &quot;I&#x27;d Give My Life For You&quot; and &quot;Too Much For One Heart.&quot; After three days of intensive work sessions in London, Salonga was offered the lead role. During an episode of &quot;Stars in the House&quot; streamed on March 28, 2020, Salonga told Seth Rudetsky and his husband, producer James Wesley, she found out that she was officially cast when she read the Sunday supplement of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

For her performance as Kim, Salonga won the 1990 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical, becoming one of the youngest winners of the award. On December 21, 1990, Salonga performed with the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra, Ateneo College Glee Club, and guest singer Robert Seña in a homecoming concert in Manila entitled &quot;A Miss Called Lea&quot;, which was later broadcast on television. She also received a Presidential Award of Merit from President Corazon Aquino for her services to the arts.

When &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; opened on Broadway in 1991, she again played the role of Kim, winning the Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle, and Theatre World awards and becoming the second-youngest actress and first actress of Asian descent to win a Tony Award. During the production transfer from West End to Broadway, a controversy erupted over Salonga&#x27;s citizenship. The Actors&#x27; Equity Association (AEA) initially prevented her from reprising the role, wishing to give priority to Asian-American performers. However, Cameron Mackintosh claimed he could not find a satisfactory replacement for Salonga, and an arbitrator later reversed the AEA ruling. In 1999, Salonga returned to reprise the role of Kim on Broadway, then again in 2001, at the age of 29 and after finishing the Manila run of the musical, this time to close the Broadway production.

In 1991, she was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful People. In 1992, she performed the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Later that year, Salonga&#x27;s agent submitted her to an audition for the leading role of Eliza Doolittle in the upcoming Broadway revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. However, the casting director for the production refused to see her because of her race. Shortly after, Salonga was contacted by Cameron Mackintosh to join the Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

She performed the song &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from &quot;Aladdin&quot; with Brad Kane at the 65th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles, where the song won an Oscar, having already won a Golden Globe Award. That same year, she released her self-titled international debut album with Atlantic Records. In 1994, Salonga played in various musical theatre productions in the Philippines and Singapore, such as Sandy in &quot;Grease&quot;, Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, and The Witch in &quot;Into the Woods&quot;.

In the U.S. in 1995, Salonga played the role of Geri Riordan, an 18-year-old adopted Vietnamese American child in the Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie &quot;Redwood Curtain&quot;, which starred John Lithgow and Jeff Daniels. She then flew back to the Philippines to star with Filipino matinée idol Aga Muhlach in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Sana Maulit Muli&quot;, which gave her a second Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) award nomination, this time for Best Actress. She reprised the role of Éponine in the 10th-anniversary concert of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which was recorded and later released as a film titled &quot;Les Misérables: The Dream Cast in Concert&quot;.

On May 6, she was recognized by Gold House at the 2nd Annual Gold House Gala, receiving the Gold Legend Honor for a &quot;lifetime of indelible contributions to the success and representation of the Asian Pacific community.&quot; On May 25, Salonga was featured on &quot;TAAF AAPI Heritage Heroes 2023&quot; on Hulu. In June 2023, it was announced that Salonga would be featured on a studio recording for the upcoming musical &quot;Wild About You&quot;, which was released in December of the same year. She returned to London&#x27;s West End to star alongside Bernadette Peters in the tribute revue &quot;Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Old Friends&quot;, which ran at the Gielgud Theatre from September 21, 2023 to January 6, 2024.

Salonga reprised her role as Elodie in &quot;Pretty Little Liars: Summer School&quot;, which premeired in May 2024. In June 2024, Salonga appeared in the audio fiction series &quot;Does This Murder Make Me Look Gay?!&quot; alongside Michael Urie, Frankie Grande, Douglas Sills, Cheyenne Jackson, Jonathan Freeman, Brad Oscar, Robin de Jesús, Lea DeLaria, Seth Rudetsky, and Kate McKinnon.

Friedman Theatre, following a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.

== Artistry ==

=== Musical style and themes ===
In her popular music releases, Salonga has sung &quot;simple love songs,&quot; common in Original Pilipino Music.

=== Influences ===
Salonga&#x27;s style and music have been inspired by musical artists such as ABBA, the Carpenters (particularly Karen Carpenter), Olivia Newton-John, the Osmonds, Elaine Paige, and Barbra Streisand. She has noted that these performers provided &quot;clear voices that really helped the listener focus on the lyrics besides the tone and music.&quot;

Salonga has repeatedly praised Streisand as one of her favorites for her &quot;mammoth&quot; career in singing, acting, producing, and arranging. During her January 15, 2000 concert at the Philippine International Convention Center, Salonga called Streisand one of her idols.

=== Voice ===

Salonga has been praised for her absolute pitch and control over her powerful vocals, which can evoke a wide array of emotions and soundscapes. Her voice has been described as &quot;golden&quot; by Marilyn Stasio for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine and &quot;clear and as sparkling as Baccarat crystal&quot; by Rex Reed for &quot;Observer&quot;.

Due to her vocal versatility, her vocal range and type classifications are often debated. When Salonga performed as Kim in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, she was expected to utilize most of her range, hitting notes as low as E3 and as high as D5. In both Disney Princess singing roles, Jasmine and Mulan, Salonga uses head tones that reach up to F5.

== Philanthropy and activism ==

=== Reproductive rights and sex education ===
In 1987, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Population Center Foundation (later renamed the Philippine Center for Population and Development) established the Philippine Young People’s Project and selected Salonga and Menudo to lead the campaign. Music videos, commercials, and live performances were used to sell the message of responsible sexual behavior and to encourage counseling for discussing and solving their problems. Additionally, Salonga promoted the campaign&#x27;s program Dial-A-Friend, a telephone hotline that provides confidential counseling regarding mental health, relationships, and contraception.

In 2011, Salonga expressed support for the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill, later signed and known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 or RH Law. On May 18, 2011, she was interviewed by Jessica Soho on &quot;State of the Nation&quot; about her views on the controversial bill. In the interview, Salonga showed understanding towards the anti-contraceptive stance held by many Filipino Catholics at the time but stated that the bill was designed &quot;to serve every single Filipino.&quot;

=== World hunger ===
On October 15, 2010, Salonga was appointed Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. In a speech, she stated: &quot;I am very honored to assume today the office of Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It is of great significance to me, as an artist, as a woman, as a mother, to have the opportunity to participate in this global effort to give support to the hungry and impoverished.&quot;

=== LGBT rights ===
Salonga has been openly supportive of LGBT equality for many years. On October 12, 2009, during a benefit concert held at the Philippine Center&#x27;s Kalayaan Hall for the victims of Typhoon Ondoy, Salonga referenced the National Equality March in Washington, D.C., and stated, &quot;I believe that every single human being has the fundamental right to marry whoever they want.&quot; In 2011, &quot;The Advocate&quot; called her a &quot;major gay icon&quot;. In February 2016, Salonga criticized Filipino politician and former professional boxer Manny Pacquiao via Twitter for his views on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. In October 2018, she tweeted, &quot;Trans rights are human rights, and trans people will not be erased.&quot;

=== Racial prejudice and violence ===
On March 29, 2021, Salonga condemned the rise of violent attacks on Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 21, 2021, she appeared with actress Lucy Liu, politician Hillary Clinton, and others in the #AAPI Women Strong: Organizing Beyond A Hashtag forum to share their experiences and spread awareness of anti-Asian hate.

For her success as a child singer and actress, she was known as the &quot;Shirley Temple of the Philippines.&quot; Salonga has been cited as an influence for several singers and actors, especially those of Asian descent, including Ali Ewoldt, Kimiko Glenn, Rachelle Ann Go, Vanessa Hudgens, Arielle Jacobs, Vina Morales, Bella Poarch, Nicole Scherzinger, Phillipa Soo, and Lola Tung.

In 2011, Salonga was declared a &quot;Disney Legend&quot; for her work with the Walt Disney Company, providing the singing voices for Princess Jasmine in &quot;Aladdin&quot; and Fa Mulan in &quot;Mulan&quot; and &quot;Mulan II&quot;. In September 2022, Salonga was recognized by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine at the TIME100 Impact Awards for being a &quot;life-long role model for children of color.&quot; In 2023, she was recognized by Gold House with the Gold Legend Honor. In September 2024, Salonga was featured as a wax figure in the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum&#x27;s Music Zone in recognition of &quot;her remarkable talent and contributions to the world of entertainment.&quot; The figure, wearing Filipino designer Rajo Laurel&#x27;s blue &quot;workhouse gown,&quot; was unveiled at Solaire Resort &amp; Casino.

For her performance as the leading role of Kim in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, Salonga won Outstanding Performance of the Year by an Actress in a Musical at the 1990 Laurence Olivier Awards before making history as the first Asian actress to win a Tony Award and the second-youngest actress to win for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical. She later became the first Asian actress to portray the role of Éponine when she joined the Broadway production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in early 1993. In 1993, she also became the first Filipino artist to sign with an international record label when she signed with Atlantic Records.

In 1990, she received a Presidential Medal of Merit from President Corazon Aquino for her services to the arts. In 2007, President Gloria Arroyo honored Salonga with the rank of Commander of the Order of Lakandula in recognition of using her talents to benefit Philippine society and foster cultural exchange. The House of Representatives of the Philippines also awarded her the Congressional Medal of Achievement for showing &quot;the extent and depth of the Filipino musical talent&quot; and &quot;opening the way for other Filipino artists to break into the finest theaters in the world.&quot;

<doc id="321077" wikidata="Q722160" url="?curid=321077" title="Juan de Salcedo">
<text>Juan de Salcedo (; 1549 – 11 March 1576) was a Spanish conquistador. He was the grandson of Spanish general Miguel López de Legazpi. Salcedo was one of the soldiers who accompanied the Spanish conquest to the Philippines in 1565. He joined the Spanish military in 1564 at age 15, on their voyage of exploration to the East Indies and the Pacific, in search of rich resources such as gold and spice, and to find a passage to the islands were the previous Spanish expeditions led by Ferdinand Magellan had landed in 1521, and Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543. 

In 1567, at age 18, Salcedo the youngest soldier in the Spanish infantry, led an army of about 300 Spanish and Mexican soldiers (Filipino and Spanish historian, Carlos Quirino estimated that over half of the expedition members where Mexicans of various mixed ethnicities, mainly Criollo, Mestizo and Indio, with the remaining being Spaniards from Spain) and 600 Visayan allies along with Martín de Goiti for their conquest of Manila (then under the Islamic occupation by the Sultanate of Brunei). There they fought a number of battles against the natives and their leaders, mainly against the chieftain Rajah Tarik Sulayman (a name derived from Arabic طارق بن زياد &quot;Tāriq&quot;), Islamic settlements in Philippines were abundant before and during the Mexican-Spanish conquest. The Spanish soldiers, together with their native Filipino allies coalesced in 1570 and 1571, to attack the native tribes and the Islamic settlements in the island of Luzon, in order to take control of their lands.

American historian William Scott called Salcedo, &quot;the last of the Conquistadores.&quot; In May 1572, Salcedo led an exploration expedition of 45 Spaniards northward and founded several Spanish settlements, including the Ilocos and the city of Vigan. Leaving 30 of his men at Vigan, Salcedo proceeded to sail around the northern Luzon coast, and down the eastern shore, with 15 men in 2 open boats. He returned to Manila 3 months later with 50 pounds of gold. 
Salcedo was granted with estates called haciendas, along with the city of Vigan, for the lands he had conquered by King Philip II of Spain. 

In 1574, Salcedo hurried back to Manila, when that city was threatened by a large pirate invasion led by Limahong who had sailed from the South China Sea. Salcedo gathered 600 infantry soldiers consisting of 300 Spaniards and Mexicans, plus their allies of 300 native Filipinos to defend the settlements and drive out the 6,500 Chinese sea pirates who had laid siege on the area. Afterwards intense fighting had occurred, and a number of his soldiers had died during the altercation. The Spaniards were able to repel the pirates. Following the Spanish success in the Battle of Manila in 1574, Salcedo pursued Limahong to Pangasinan in 1575. There the Spaniards besieged the pirates for four months, before Limahong surrendered and made good of his escape. 
After the war, he returned to the Ilocos to govern the settlements. There he would spend his final years. 

Salcedo died suddenly in March 1576, after a short illness, probably of dysentery at the age of 27. 

== Personal life ==

Salcedo was born in 1549 in the Spanish territory of Mexico on the colony of the viceroyalty of New Spain. He was the son of Pedro de Salcedo and Teresa López de Legazpi. He had one older brother named Felipe de Salcedo, who was also a soldier in the Spanish army, and who accompanied him and his grandfather during their campaigns to the Philippines. Their mother was the daughter of Miguel López de Legazpi and Isabel Garcés. 

Salcedo was married to Princess Kandarapa, the native Princess of Tondo in 1572, at the age of 23. According to Philippine historical documents and a written account by Don Felipe Cepeda, Salcedo&#x27;s aide, who returned to Acapulco, recount that after the Spanish conquest of Luzon with Mexican and Visayan assistance, and their consequent takeover of the Pasig River delta polity of Hindu Tondo, which was the previous preeminent state in Luzon before the Brunei Sultanate established their puppet-kingdom, Islamic Manila, to supplant Tondo, Juan de Salcedo, then about 22 years old, fell in love with the 18-year-old &quot;Dayang-dayang&quot; (a native Filipino word for &quot;Princess&quot;) Kandarapa, so named after the lark of the rice fields, whose song she imitated by her beautiful singing voice, was said to be the niece of Rajah Lakandula, Tondo&#x27;s Lakan (&quot;Paramount ruler&quot;). Juan fell in love, upon seeing the femininity of her figure while she and her handmaidens were bathing in the Pasig River. 
Salcedo had developed an admiration of Kandarapa&#x27;s natural physical beauty, including her long black raven hair, exotic golden-brown skin features, and lavish royal lifestyle. He also appreciated the Princesses &quot;Indio&quot; (a Spanish word for indigenous Malay also known as North Indian due to the Hindu religion of Tondo and East Asian trading influence with the Far East) background. 

Their love was completely against their forebears&#x27; wishes since Lakandula wanted his niece, Dayang-dayang Kandarapa, to be married to the Rajah of Macabebe which Kandarapa didn&#x27;t want as he was already married multiple times to other women due to his Islamic custom; and Miguel López de Legazpi wanted his Mexican born grandson, Salcedo, to marry a pure white European Spanish woman. The Rajah of Macabebe who got word of the budding romance from Rajah Sulayman a fellow Muslim Rajah, of Manila, became enraged and he cried out:


The chieftain Rajah Tariq Sulayman then waged the Battle of Bangkusay against the Spaniards, to counter-act which, Spanish general Miguel López de Legazpi dispatched Martin de Goiti and Juan de Salcedo to the battlefield where they slayed Sulayman through a cannon shot to the chest, thereby falling overboard to be eaten by the crocodiles he swore by. The Spanish were afterward overloaded with loot and prisoners. Among the detainees were Lakandula&#x27;s son and nephew, whom López de Legazpi freed while concealing his knowledge of the rajahs of Tondo&#x27;s betrayal. De Goiti sailed into Bulakan through the twisting channels of the Pampanga, bringing Lakandula and Rajah Sulayman with them to urge the inhabitants to submit. López de Legazpi imprisoned Lakandula after he returned to Tondo without authorization despite his eloquence in persuading the other datus (chieftains) to join the Spaniards. When de Goiti and Salcedo returned, of course, Salcedo petitioned for Lakandula&#x27;s freedom, and he was released.

Afterwards Juan and Kandarapa secretly married, Juan and Kandarapa exchanged letters and rings, hoping that the future will resolve their problems and offer them happiness. Fray Alvarado quickly catechized and baptized Kandarapa, along with many other members of Lakandula&#x27;s family, to the Roman Catholic faith and gave Kandarapa the Christian name Dolores. Her Spanish name was Dolores de Salcedo. Kandarapa sent Salcedo a message within a cluster of white lotus flowers (The lotus flower is the most sacred flower in Tantric Mysticism since it is pure and beautiful despite growing from the mud of its surroundings. It is simultaneously a chief symbol of the Hindu God Vishnu and associated with Zen Buddhism as well.) However, princess Kandarapa mistakenly thought that Salcedo had been unfaithful to her as a result of the disapproving López de Legazpi sending his Mexican grandson on far flung expeditions to deter his love for Kandarapa, and even lying that his grandson had married the daughter of the Rajah of Kaog, Santa Lucia. So, she died of a broken heart. Upon going back from his campaigns, Salcedo learned of her death and yet kept her token of fidelity with him until the end. It is said that when he died in Ilocos, he had in his breast pocket, the dried leaves of the Lotus flowers Kandarapa gave him. This romance, as recorded by Don Felipe Cepeda in Mexico, was picked up by the Catalonian Jesuit, Rev. Fr. Jose Ibañez, who published this romance in Spain.

<doc id="321080" wikidata="Q810447" url="?curid=321080" title="Bass instrument">
<text>A bass instrument () is a musical instrument that produces tones in the low-pitched range C2–C4. Basses belong to different families of instruments and can cover a wide range of musical roles. Since producing low pitches usually requires a long air column or string, the string and wind bass instruments are usually the largest instruments in their families or instrument classes.

A difficulty in categorizing instruments is that some instruments fall into more than one category. The cello is considered a tenor instrument in some orchestral settings, but in a string quartet it is the bass instrument.

A musician playing one of these instruments is often known as a bassist. Other more specific terms such as &#x27;bass guitarist&#x27;, &#x27;double bassist&#x27;, &#x27;bass player&#x27;, may also be used.

== Examples ==
===Plucked string instruments===
Plucked string instruments classified as basses include the electric bass guitar, the acoustic bass guitar, folk instruments like contrabass guitar, guitarrón mexicano, tololoche, bass banjo or bass balalaika.

The electric bass guitar is usually the instrument referred to as a &quot;bass&quot; in pop and rock music. The electric bass guitar, while invented in the 1930s by Paul Tutmarc, was first mass-produced by Leo Fender in 1951 and quickly replaced the more unwieldy double bass among non-classical musicians.

===Bowed string instruments===
Bowed string instruments, include the double bass, the cello and the violone.

The double bass is usually the instrument referred to as a &quot;bass&quot; in European classical music and jazz, sometimes called a &quot;string bass&quot; to differentiate it from a &quot;brass bass&quot; or &quot;bass horn&quot;, or an &quot;upright bass&quot; to differentiate it from a &quot;bass guitar&quot;. Although being bowed instruments, they can be played pizzicato, which is a standard double bass technique in jazz, blues and rockabilly.

Mozart called the cello the most common bass instrument in his time, and in chamber music of the late eighteenth century, the cello was specified more often as the bass instrument (&quot;Basso&quot;) than the double bass.

===Voice===
A bass singer has the lowest vocal range of all voice types, typically a range extending from around the second E below middle C to the E above middle C (i.e., E2–E4).

In SATB four-part choral singing, the letter B stands for bass, which is the lowest of the four vocal sections.

The basso profondo is a subtype of the bass voice type able to sing low notes, extending to C2 and possibly lower.

===Wind instruments===
A bass horn, such as a tuba, serpent, and sousaphone from the wind family and low-tuned versions of specific types of brass and woodwind instruments, such as bassoon, bass clarinet, bass trombone, and bass saxophone, the last of which was the first saxophone invented by Adolphe Sax. The serpent was invented around the end of the 15th century, with lower instruments, such as the bass-tuba appearing over subsequent centuries.

===Other===
Keyboard bass, a keyboard alternative to the bass guitar or double bass (e.g. the Fender Rhodes piano bass in the 1960s or 13-note MIDI keyboard controllers in the 2000s). This instrument peaked in popularity during the late 1970s and early 1980s, being particularly associated with the synth pop genre.

Bass pedalboard, a keyboard operated by feet found at the base of the console of most pipe organs, pedal pianos, theatre organs, and electric organs.

Washtub bass, a simple folk instrument. Also known as a &quot;gutbucket&quot;, it is generally believed to have derived from the African ground bow.

<text>Ann Dustin Wilson (born June 19, 1950) is an American singer best known as the lead singer of the rock band Heart.

Wilson has been a member of Heart since the early 1970s; her younger sister, Nancy Wilson, is also a member of the band. One of the first hard rock bands fronted by women, Heart released numerous albums between 1975 and 2016; the early Heart albums &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; (1975) and &quot;Little Queen&quot; (1977) generated classic hard rock singles such as &quot;Magic Man&quot;, &quot;Crazy on You&quot;, and &quot;Barracuda&quot;. Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, placed 29 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and has scored top 10 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s.

Wilson was ranked no. 78 in &quot;Hit Parader&#x27;s&quot; 2006 list of &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot;. In 2013, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Heart. Wilson possesses a dramatic soprano vocal range. She is known for her operatic abilities.

==Early life==
Ann Dustin Wilson was born in San Diego, California. Her father was a major in the U.S. Marine Corps. Due to her father&#x27;s military career, the Wilson family moved frequently. They lived near American military facilities in Panama and Taiwan before settling in Seattle, Washington, in the early 1960s. To maintain a sense of home no matter where in the world they were residing, the Wilsons turned to music. &quot;On Sunday we&#x27;d have pancakes and opera,&quot; her sister Nancy Wilson recalled. &quot;My dad would be conducting in the living room. We&#x27;d turn it way up and rock. There was everything from classical music to Ray Charles, Judy Garland, Peggy Lee, bossa nova, and early experimental electronic music.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s family eventually settled in Bellevue, a suburb of Seattle, Washington. In 1968, she graduated from Sammamish High School. Shy because of a stutter, Wilson sought fulfillment in music. In the early 1970s she joined a local band, White Heart, which changed its name to Hocus Pocus, and then in 1974 to Heart. Wilson also attended Cornish College of the Arts.

==Career==

Wilson&#x27;s younger sister, Nancy, joined Heart, and the band moved to Canada. Heart recorded their first album &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; in Vancouver in 1975. It was released in the United States in 1976, with &quot;Magic Man&quot; becoming Heart&#x27;s first Top 10 hit in the United States, peaking at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, and &quot;Crazy on You&quot; hitting number 35. Both songs were co-written by Ann and Nancy Wilson. In 1977, &quot;Little Queen&quot; was released, and in 1978, &quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot;. In 1986, &quot;These Dreams&quot; rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 1992, Wilson appeared on Alice in Chains&#x27; EP &quot;Sap&quot;; she sang on &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Am I Inside&quot;.

The Wilson sisters started a recording studio, Bad Animals, in Seattle in the mid-1980s. They formed a side band, the Lovemongers, which performed Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; on the 1992 soundtrack to the Cameron Crowe (Nancy&#x27;s then husband) movie &quot;Singles&quot;, and later released a four-song EP. The Lovemongers&#x27; debut album &quot;Whirlygig&quot; was released in 1997.

Wilson joined producer Alan Parsons in &quot;A Walk Down Abbey Road&quot;, the 2001 live tribute tour to Beatles music.

Wilson&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Hope &amp; Glory&quot;, was released on September 11, 2007. &quot;Hope &amp; Glory&quot; features guest appearances from Elton John, k.d. lang, Alison Krauss, Gretchen Wilson, Shawn Colvin, Rufus Wainwright, Wynonna Judd, and Deana Carter. Nancy Wilson also contributed. Three singles were released from the project: &quot;Little Problems, Little Lies&quot;, &quot;Isolation&quot;, and a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot;

On November 22, 2012, Wilson sang an original arrangement of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, accompanied by the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, at the beginning of the Thanksgiving Day football game between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins.

The Wilson sisters performed at the Kennedy Center tribute to Led Zeppelin on December 2, 2012. Present at the event were the three living members of Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones. The Wilsons performed &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, backed by an orchestra and a choir, and featuring drummer Jason Bonham (son of deceased Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham).

On July 13, 2015, Wilson announced a solo tour, The Ann Wilson Thing, which began on September 21. She released her first EP, &quot;The Ann Wilson Thing! – #1&quot;, digitally on September 18, 2015. On July 22, 2016, Wilson announced the release of &quot;focus&quot;, the second EP from The Ann Wilson Thing! Wilson played a Florida mini-tour in September 2016 as The Ann Wilson Thing! in support of this release.

On October 12, 2017, Wilson&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Ann Wilson: In Focus&quot; was released. It featured an intimate interview conducted in her home by Criss Cain along with 20 complete live song performances from the Ann Wilson of Heart tour stop in Wilmington, North Carolina, on March 21, 2017.

Wilson and Alice in Chains&#x27; guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell paid tribute to their late friend, Chris Cornell, with a rendition of Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on April 14, 2018.

On August 3, 2018, Wilson released &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; as the second single from her solo album, &quot;Immortal&quot;. Released on September 14, 2018, the album features ten tracks that pay tribute to Wilson&#x27;s influences and friends.

In May 2021, Wilson announced her first dates since the COVID-19 pandemic with the Rite of June mini-tour.

In 2022, Wilson was nominated for consideration into the 2023 Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In November 2022, Wilson was featured on the Disturbed song &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; from their album &quot;Divisive&quot;. The song reached number 2 on Billboard&#x27;s Hard Rock Song Sales chart.

On April 25, 2024, Heart kicked off their Royal Flush 2024 Tour at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida. The June and July 2024 dates of this tour, in the UK and Europe, were canceled in late May as the organizers informed that &quot;In late May, Ann Wilson will undergo a time-sensitive but routine medical procedure for which the minimum recovery time is six weeks.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
During the 1970s, Wilson was in a relationship with Michael Fisher, the manager of Heart, while Nancy was involved with lead guitarist Roger Fisher, Michael&#x27;s younger brother. Both couples controlled the band. In 1979, the relationships ended; Ann stated that Michael had fallen in love with another woman and they parted.

In 1991 Wilson adopted a daughter, Marie, and in 1998 she adopted a son, Dustin.

Wilson married Dean Wetter in April 2015. The pair had dated briefly in the 1980s. On the morning of August 27, 2016, Wetter was arrested for assaulting his nephews, Nancy Wilson&#x27;s 16-year-old twin sons, after the boys had left the door to his RV open. The incident took place during a Heart performance at the White River Amphitheatre in Auburn, Washington the previous night. Wetter pleaded guilty to the charges. The sisters&#x27; relationship was strained by the incident. Following the end of Heart&#x27;s 2016 tour, the sisters opted to tour with their own side-project bands, with Ann saying in April 2017 that Heart was on hiatus.

In February 2019, the sisters announced that Heart&#x27;s hiatus had ended and that the band would embark on the Love Alive tour in the summer. In March 2019, at the Love Rocks NYC benefit concert, the sisters reunited on stage for the first time since the band went on hiatus.

===Health===
As a child, Wilson was bullied for being overweight. She revealed that in the 1970s and into the early 1980s she would starve herself and use diet pills to stay thin. By the time Heart made a comeback in the mid-&#x27;80s, she had gained a significant amount of weight. Fearing that Heart&#x27;s lead singer&#x27;s physique would compromise the band&#x27;s image, record company executives and band members began pressuring her to lose weight. In music videos, camera angles and clothes were often used to minimize her size, and more focus was put on Ann&#x27;s more slender sister, Nancy. Wilson stated she began suffering from stress-related panic attacks due to the negative publicity surrounding her weight. She underwent adjustable gastric band weight-loss surgery in January 2002 after what she called &quot;a lifelong battle&quot; with her weight.

In the band&#x27;s 2012 autobiography, Wilson revealed her past struggles with cocaine and alcoholism, stating that she had been sober since 2009.

In July 2024, it was announced that Wilson had been diagnosed with cancer. A tumor had been removed surgically, and Heart postponed touring until 2025 to allow her to undergo preventative chemotherapy.

<text>Gustav Siegfried Eins (GS1) was a British black propaganda radio station during World War II operated by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE). It was the brainchild of Sefton Delmer, a former BBC German service announcer recruited by PWE in 1940, and claimed to be an illegal radio station operating within Nazi Germany. The callsign was based on the German Army phonetic alphabet for the letters GS, but had no meaning.

The programmes were recorded on glass disc at the Wavendon Tower studio then taken to the short wave radio stations at Signal Hill, Gawcott and Potsgrove.

==Broadcasts==
The broadcaster was , a refugee from Berlin, who used the name &quot;Der Chef&quot; and claimed to be a proud, highly patriotic Prussian officer of the old school, totally loyal to Germany. In the first &quot;Gustav Siegfried Eins&quot; broadcast, immediately after the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland, &quot;Der Chef&quot; ranted that &quot;As soon as there is a crisis, Hess packs himself a white flag and flies off to throw himself and us on the mercy of that flat-footed bastard of a drunken old cigar-smoking Jew, Churchill!&quot;

Most of &quot;Der Chef&#x27;s&quot; diatribes were directed against low- and middle-ranking Nazi Party officials, the so-called &quot;Partei Kommune&quot;, which he portrayed as selfish, corrupt and sexually depraved gangsters whose behaviour shamefully contrasted with &#x27;the devotion to duty shown by our brave troops freezing to death in Russia&#x27;.

The first broadcast was on the evening of 23 May 1941 and the final broadcast in late October 1943. The scripting ostensibly had the Gestapo storm the station and shoot &quot;Der Chef&quot;. Unfortunately, the recording engineer who played the transcription did not understand German, and played the &quot;death&quot; of Der Chef twice.

The station was replaced by &quot;Soldatensender Calais&quot;.

<text>Henry (; ; ; died 20 January 1156) was a medieval English clergyman. He came to Sweden with Cardinal Nicholas Breakspeare in 1153 and was most likely designated to be the new Archbishop of Uppsala, but the independent church province of Sweden could only be established in 1164 after the civil war, and Henry would have been sent to organize the Church in Finland, where Christians had already existed for two centuries.

According to legend, he entered Finland during the First Crusade together with the king, Saint Eric of Sweden, and died as a martyr, becoming the patron saint of the Catholic Church in Finland. However, the authenticity of the accounts of his life and ministry are widely disputed and there are no historical records of his birth, death, or even his existence.

Together with his alleged murderer, peasant Lalli, Henry is an important figure in the early history of Finland. His feast is celebrated by the majority Lutheran Church of Finland, as well as by the Catholic Church of Finland. He is commemorated in the liturgical calendars of several Lutheran and Anglican churches.

== Legend ==

=== &quot;Vita&quot; and &quot;miracula&quot; ===
The legend of Bishop Henry&#x27;s life, or his &quot;Vita&quot;, was written 150 years after his time, at the end of the 13th century, and contains little concrete information about him. He is said to have been an English-born bishop in Uppsala at the time of King Eric the Saint of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian Finns, Eric and Henry were forced to do battle with them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built many churches, the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (&quot;Henricus&quot;) remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher than that of a high bishop.

The legend draws to a conclusion as Henry attempted to give a canonical punishment to a murderer. The accused man became enraged and killed the bishop, who was thus considered to be a martyr.

The legend strongly emphasizes that Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland which became a conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The &quot;vita&quot; is so void of any concrete information about Finland that it could have been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.
Henry&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot; is followed by the more local &quot;miracula&quot;, a list of eleven miracles that various people were said to have experienced sometime after the bishop&#x27;s death. With the exception of a priest in Skara who suffered a stomach ache after mocking Henry, all miracles seem to have taken place in Finland. The other miracles, which usually occurred following prayer to Bishop Henry, were:

# The murderer lost his scalp when he put the bishop&#x27;s hat on his head
# The Bishop&#x27;s finger was found the next Spring
# A boy was raised from the dead in Kaisala
# A girl was raised from the dead in Vehmaa
# A sick woman was healed in Sastamala
# A Franciscan called Erlend had his headache healed
# A blind woman got back her eyesight in Kyrö
# A man with a paralyzed leg could walk again in Kyrö
# A sick girl was healed
# A group of fishermen from Kokemäki survived a storm

Most versions of Henry&#x27;s legend only include a selection of these miracles.

=== Development of the legend ===

Henry and his crusade to Finland were also a part of the legend of King Eric. The appendix of the early 13th century &quot;Västgötalagen&quot;, which has a short description of Eric&#x27;s memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade do not appear until a version of Eric&#x27;s legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry&#x27;s legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku.

====Absence from the historical record====
Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the &quot;Chronica regni Gothorum&quot;, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.

Noteworthy in the development of the legend is that the first canonically elected Bishop of Turku, Johan (1286–1289) of Polish origin, was elected as the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1289, after three years in office in Turku. The Swedish bishops of Finland before him, Bero, Ragvald and Kettil, had apparently been selected by the King of Sweden. Related to the new situation was also the appointment of the king&#x27;s brother Bengt Birgersson as the Duke of Finland in 1284, which challenged the Bishop&#x27;s earlier position as the sole authority on all local matters. Johan was followed in Turku by Bishop Magnus (1291–1308), who had been born in Finland.

In 1291 a document by the cathedral chapter makes no reference to Henry even though it mentions the cathedral and election of the new bishop many times. A papal letter by Pope Nicholas IV from 1292 has the Virgin Mary as the sole &quot;patrona&quot; in Turku.

====Appearance in the historical record====
The first mention of Bishop Henry in historical sources is from 1298, when he is mentioned along with king Eric in a document from a provincial synod of Uppsala in Telge. This document, although mentioned many times as a source over the centuries, was not correctly dated until 1910. 

The legend itself is also first referred in a letter by the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298, where Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to for the sake of the situation in Karelia, associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against Novgorod. The war between Novgorod and Sweden for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry&#x27;s image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is not until 1299.

The first mention of Henry of Uppsala being the patron saint of Turku cathedral is not until 14 August 1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary. When he is later addressed by Pope Boniface IX as the &quot;patronus&quot; of the Cathedral of Turku along with the Virgin Mary, and referred to as a saint, it was in the year 1391. Some sources claim that Henry was canonized in 1158, but this information has been traced to a late publication by Johannes Vastovius in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.

Thus, Henry&#x27;s veneration as a saint and his relation to King Eric seem to have emerged in the historical record at the same time in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption that Henry&#x27;s cult developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. In 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated only to the Virgin Mary, and it was not until 1452 that Henry was mentioned as the &quot;patronus&quot; of Nousiainen.

=== Veneration===

Despite the high-profile start of Henry&#x27;s &quot;cultus&quot;, it took more than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry&#x27;s veneration was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have played a key role in establishment of Henry&#x27;s legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest &quot;totum duplex&quot; veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a &quot;patronus&quot; of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.

At the end of the Roman Catholic era in Sweden, Henry was well established as a local saint. The dioceses in Sweden and elsewhere venerating Henry were as follows, categorized by his local ranking:

# &quot;Totum duplex&quot;: Turku, Linköping, Strängnäs
# &quot;Duplex&quot;: Uppsala, Lund (Denmark), Västerås, Växjö
# &quot;Semiduplex&quot;: Nidaros (Norway)
# &quot;Simplex&quot;: Skara

Henry seems to have been known in northern Germany, but he was largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.
In the Bishopric of Turku, the annual feast day of Henry was 20 January (&quot;talviheikki&quot;, &quot;Winter Henry&quot;), according to traditions the day of his death. Elsewhere his memorial was held already on 19 January, since more prominent saints were already commemorated on 20 January. After the Reformation, Henry&#x27;s day was moved to the 19th in Finland as well. The existence of the feast day is first mentioned in 1335, and is known to have been marked in the liturgical calendar from the early 15th century onwards. Another memorial was held on 18 June (&quot;kesäheikki&quot;, &quot;Summer Henry&quot;) which was the day of the translation of his relics to the Cathedral of Turku.
&quot;Gaudeamus omnes&quot; (&quot;Let all rejoice&quot;), a Gregorian introit for the Mass in honor of Henry has survived within the late 14th or early 15th century &quot;Graduale Aboense&quot;.

=== Political dimensions ===
According to legend, establishment of the church of Finland was entirely the work of the saint-king Eric of Sweden, assisted by the bishop from the most important diocese in the country. The first half of the legend describes how the king and the bishop ruled Sweden like &#x27;two great lights&#x27; with feelings of &#x27;internal love&#x27; toward each other, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of the secular and ecclesiastical rule during a happy era when &#x27;predatory wolves&#x27; could not hit their &#x27;poisonous teeth against the innocent&#x27;. The reality was quite different – Eric&#x27;s predecessor, Eric himself and two of his successors were all murdered almost within a decade, one of the bloodiest times for the Swedish royalty. In the 1150s, the Bishop of Uppsala was also in a bitter fight with the Bishop of Linköping over which see would become archiepiscopal. The crusade itself is described as a brief and bloodless event that was only performed to bring the &quot;blind and evil heathen people of Finland&quot; under Christian order.

The writer of the legend seems to have been especially interested in presenting the bishop as a humble martyr. He has fully ignored his place of death and burial and other &quot;domestic&quot; Finnish interests, which were much more apparent in folk traditions. The legend and folk traditions eventually influenced each other, and the church gradually adopted many additional details to its saint bishop.

== Folk traditions ==
Among the many folk traditions about Henry, the most prominent is the folk poem &quot;The Death-lay of Bishop Henry&quot; (&quot;Piispa Henrikin surmavirsi&quot;). The poem almost completely ignores Henry&#x27;s life and ministry and concentrates on his death.

=== Henry&#x27;s origins ===
According to the poem, Henry had grown up in &quot;Cabbage Land&quot; (&quot;Kaalimaa&quot;), which has puzzled Finnish historians for centuries. The name might be connected to a coastal area in northern Finland Proper called &quot;Kaland&quot;, which is also mentioned in conjunction with an unrelated early preacher in Vesilahti, upper Satakunta, whose local name was &quot;Fish of Kaland&quot; (&quot;Kalannin kala&quot;, also known as &quot;Hunnun herra&quot;). Bishop Mikael Agricola wrote in his &quot;Se Wsi Testamenti&quot; in 1548, that the earliest Swedish settlers in Finland had come from Gotland to the islets on the coast of Kaland, being harassed by Finns and seeking help from their relatives in Sweden.

It has also been suggested that the name might be related to Gaelic, which would presumably have referred to the bishop&#x27;s Scottish origins, though the legend gives him as a native Englishman.

Folk traditions have no information on the crusade whatsoever. King Eric is briefly mentioned in the death-lay&#x27;s preface as Henry&#x27;s concerned &quot;brother&quot;. Henry appears as a lone preacher who moved around southwestern Finland more or less on his own. Besides the name, he has only little in common with the Henry in the church &quot;vita&quot;.

Kokemäki is often mentioned in traditions as a place where Henry preached. Kokemäki was later one of the central parishes in Satakunta. This province was first mentioned in historical documents in 1331.

=== Death and burial ===
The death-lay&#x27;s version of the bishop&#x27;s death was different from the vita. The bishop&#x27;s killer was called Lalli. Lalli&#x27;s wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi in Eura. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man&#x27;s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head. When Lalli&#x27;s mother questioned him about where he found the hat, he attempted to take it off, but with it came his scalp. Lalli then died a painful death. The 17th century lay version smugly comments that:

The 17th century lay version of the tale was intended to be performed during the annual pilgrimage along Henrik&#x27;s final route.

In some versions of the poem, considered older, Lalli&#x27;s weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry&#x27;s legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed as a member of the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry&#x27;s murder.

Before his death, Henry instructed the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, place it in a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was to replace it with an ox, and when the ox stopped, he was to build a church. This is where Henrik&#x27;s remains were to be buried.

Medieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli after his slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp are said to have fallen out as he took off the bishop&#x27;s cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop&#x27;s ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.

=== Development of folk traditions ===
Basically the death-lay is a simple story of a short-tempered man who falls victim of his &quot;bad-mouthed wife&#x27;s&quot; sharp tongue. The poem has no pity for Lalli, and he is not depicted as a hero in a story whose true antagonist is Kerttu. The depiction of Henry&#x27;s death built on an independent tradition that was once in direct competition with that of the legend, which is largely forgotten today. It remains unknown whether the two traditions were built around the same person.

The poem, following the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from various parts of Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the &quot;vita&quot;. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed by one or more individuals. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.

Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are originally German names, which might indicate that the poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what happens to him later seem to be taken from a medieval Judas fable. Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.

Based on finds from medieval church ruins in the tiny island of Kirkkokari (&quot;Church Rock&quot;, previously known as the &quot;Island of Saint Henry&quot;) in Lake Köyliönjärvi, the bishop&#x27;s veneration began in the latter half of the 14th century, well after Henry had received his official status as a local saint, and 200 years after his alleged death. A small granary in the nearby Kokemäki, claimed to have been the bishop&#x27;s place of rest the night before his death, could not be dated earlier than the late 15th century in dendrochronological examinations.

However, the poem&#x27;s claim that Henry was buried in Nousiainen was already held to be true around 1300, when his alleged bones were translated from Nousiainen to the Cathedral of Turku. A mid-15th century &quot;Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium&quot; also confirmed Köyliö as the place of his death. Neither place is mentioned in the &quot;vita&quot; in any way. The church seems to have gradually complemented its own legends by adopting elements from the folk traditions, especially during the 15th century.

== Historical sources ==
Today, the legend of Henry is challenged by some historians to the point of being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and there is no direct evidence of either the crusade or Henry.

The bishop&#x27;s alleged violent death however, is no reason to doubt his potential existence, as many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.

=== Bishop of Uppsala ===
There is no historical record of a Bishop of Uppsala called Henry during the reign of King Eric (about 1156–1160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of Stefan, who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.

A certain Henry is mentioned in &quot;Incerti scriptoris Sueci chronicon primorum in ecclesia Upsalensi archiepiscoporum&quot;, a chronicle of Uppsala archbishops, before Coppmannus and Stefan, but after Sverinius (probably mentioned in German sources in 1141/2 as &quot;Siwardus&quot;), Nicolaus and Sweno. Besides the name, the chronicle knows that he was martyred and buried in Finland in the Cathedral of Turku. Latest research dates the chronicle to the early 15th century when Henry&#x27;s legend was already established in the kingdom, leaving only little significance to its testimony.
A late 15th century &quot;legenda nova&quot; claimed that Henry had come to Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and appointed as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though &quot;legenda nova&quot; states 1150 as the year of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, based on the fact that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by &quot;legenda nova&quot; was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry&#x27;s death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.

Contradicting these claims, the medieval &quot;Annales Suecici Medii Aevi&quot; and the 13th century legend of Saint Botvid mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (&quot;Henricus scilicet Upsalensis&quot;) in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint&#x27;s newly built church. He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot; written soon after his death and from Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from Sigtuna, the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164. He is ignored in all Swedish bishop chronicles, unless he is the same Henry who was later redated to the 1150s. That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.

Noteworthy also, is a story written down by Adam of Bremen in his &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) from 1075/6 about a certain foreigner called &quot;Hericus&quot;, who was slain and martyred while preaching among the &quot;Sueones&quot;. Adam had heard the story from King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born &quot;Henricus&quot;, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.

=== Bishop of Finland ===
No historical source remains that would confirm the existence of a bishop named Henry in Finland. However, papal letters mentioning an unidentified Bishop of Finland in 1209, 1221, 1229 and 1232 have survived. Some copies of another papal letter from 1232 call the bishop as &quot;N.&quot;, but the letter &quot;N&quot; may originally have also been something resembling it. The first certainly known Bishop of Finland is Thomas, who is first mentioned in 1234. It is however possible, that Fulco, the Bishop of Estonia mentioned in sources from 1165 and 1171, was the same as Folquinus, a legendary Bishop of Finland at the end of the 12th century, but this remains only a theory.
No Bishop or Diocese of Finland is mentioned in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed Pope Alexander III, who otherwise addressed the situation of the church in Finland. The Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns. The Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the first missionary Bishop of Estonia to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both Eskil, the Archbishop of Lund, and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, the Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.

No surviving list of bishops or dioceses under the Archbishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains any reference to Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland is made in any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.
The first mention of a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to Archbishop Anders of Lund by Pope Innocent III as a reply to the Archbishop&#x27;s earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly established church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been &quot;lawful&quot;, and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope how difficult it was to get anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop&#x27;s suggestion without questioning his opinions. It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, Valerius (1207–1219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed King Sverker, yet another exile in Denmark.

Whether the appointment of the said preacher ever took place, remains unknown. Note should be taken that the King of Sweden at the time was Eric, a grandson of his better known namesake Eric the Saint. Eric had taken over Sweden in 1208 and was crowned king two years later. The Pope who had strongly sided with Sverker, ignored him at first, but finally recognized him in 1216, commenting many requests that he had apparently made ever since having taken the office. Based on the papal letter that year, Eric seems to have had a plan to invade some country that allegedly had been &quot;taken from the heathens by his predecessors&quot; and was allowed to install a bishop there. Similar letters were sent to the King of Denmark in 1208 and 1218, who is known to have meant Estonia both times. Sweden also attacked Estonia in 1220. Eric died of illness 1216. Almost nothing is known about his time as the king.

Nevertheless, someone was eventually appointed and installed as the new bishop, since Pope Honorius III sent a letter directly to an unnamed Bishop of Finland in 1221. According to the letter, Archbishop Valerius had followed the situation in Finland and sent a report to the Pope, worried about a threat from unidentified &quot;barbarians&quot;. It is notable that when the Pope quoted Valerius in his letter, he calls the church in Finland to have been established &quot;newly&quot;, the same claim that Anders had made 12 years earlier. The list of Swedish bishops which survives from this era is from king John Sverkerson&#x27;s coronation from the year 1219 and it mentions the bishops which have been present at the coronation. Finland as well as Wäxjö are not among those five, which so seem to have been all the bishops of the Swedish realm at that time. So the Finnish bishop&#x27;s possible position under Uppsala&#x27;s primacy is highly improbable.

Despite so many high-ranking church representatives being involved in the 1209/1221 arrangements, later chronicles are fully ignorant on the situation in Finland at the time, or if there was even a bishop then. The first 13th-century bishop is said to have been Thomas, and his predecessor remains unknown. According to 15th and 16th century chronicles, Henry was followed by bishops Rodulff and Folquinus, after whom there was a 25–30-year gap before Thomas. However, according to the papal letter Ex tuarum no such gap has ever existed, since the archbishop of Lund
was given the right to anoint a new bishop to Finland in 1209 after the death of the previous. So the logic and datings of the sixteenth-century writers must be esteemed as false. The date 1209 is far too early for a Dominican like Thomas to step into the office, and so Rodolphus, the first real bishop of Finland and his successor Folquinus must be considered as 13th-century bishops nominated and appointed by the Danish and not by the Swedes. As an extra proof of this the ancient Finnish taxation system of church taxes has its roots in Denmark, not in Sweden. And the same goes to lay taxes especially in the Åland Islands and to the old Finnish monetary system. As J. W. Ruuth already nearly a hundred years ago pointed out, Finland was at that time a Danish and not a Swedish mission territory, where the Danes according to the Danish annals made there expeditions in 1191, 1202 and possible even 1210

=== Relics ===

Henry was allegedly buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least something that was thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.

Whatever the case, the bishop&#x27;s grave seems to have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his elevation to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop&#x27;s grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to Turku. The church was later adorned with a grandiose 15th century cenotaph, whose replica can be found in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.
Most of the bones in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a transfer to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side during the war and was in charge of the grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry&#x27;s ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming&#x27;s reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities. It was later placed inside the altar of St. Henry&#x27;s Cathedral in Helsinki.

In 1924, a jawless skull and several other bones were found in a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are also referred to as Henry&#x27;s relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to another saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.

=== Henry&#x27;s status today ===
Although Henry has never been officially canonized, he has been referred to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry&#x27;s death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on 19 January on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. 19 January is also Henry&#x27;s name day (so-called &quot;Heikinpäivä&quot;) in Sweden and Finland. He continues to be remembered as a local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, whose sole cathedral is dedicated to him. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Jean Claude Kabeza.

The Kirkkokari island in Lake Köyliönjärvi remains the only Catholic place of pilgrimage in Finland, with a memorial service held every year on second Sunday in June before the Midsummer festival. Also the medieval 140 km countryside route, the &quot;Saint Henry&#x27;s Way&quot;, from Köyliö to Nousiainen has been marked all the way for people willing to walk through it. Association of &quot;Ecumenical pilgrimage of St. Henry&quot; has been organized around the event.

Based on folk traditions about the bishop&#x27;s activities, the municipalities of Nousiainen, Köyliö and Kokemäki use images from Henry&#x27;s legend in their coats of arms.

Today, Henry and his alleged murderer Lalli remain two of the best-known persons from the mediæval history of Finland.

=== In modern popular culture ===
The story of Henry&#x27;s death on the lake is the subject of the song &quot;Köyliönjärven jäällä&quot;, by Finnish metal band Moonsorrow.

<text>Star Wars: Customizable Card Game (SW:CCG) is an out-of-print customizable card game based on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fictional universe. It was created by Decipher, Inc., which also produced the &quot;Star Trek Customizable Card Game&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot;. The game was produced from December 1995 until December 2001. Since 2002, the game has been maintained by the Star Wars CCG Players Committee, with new virtual cards being released every few months and the capability to play both in person and online.

==History==
&quot;Star Wars CCG&quot; was first released in December 1995. Over the years, Decipher added 11 full expansions to the original card base, as well as numerous smaller expansions, special purpose sets, and promotional releases. The last set, Theed Palace, was offered in the fall of 2001. The original game spanned all of the classic &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy (&quot;A New Hope&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;). During several years of the game&#x27;s run, between 1995 and 1998, it was a top-selling CCG, second only to &quot;&quot; and occasionally surpassing &quot;Magic&quot;, according to both &quot;InQuest&quot; and &quot;Scrye&quot; magazines.

Lucasfilm renewed Decipher&#x27;s license in 1998 to include intellectual property from &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, the first film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. In addition to expansion sets based on the films, Decipher planned to release sets based on the novels and computer games, and a new trading card game base on the prequel trilogy films. At the end of 2001, after much negotiation, Lucasfilm chose not to renew Decipher&#x27;s license to use the &quot;Star Wars&quot; intellectual property. The license was granted to Wizards of the Coast, which used it to create their own game, the &quot;Star Wars Trading Card Game&quot;. Decipher could no longer legally create new expansions to &quot;SWCCG&quot;; many cards that were in development were never released to the public.

In January 2002, Decipher CEO Warren Holland announced the formation of a &quot;Players&#x27; Committee&quot;. Decipher would turn over stewardship of the game to this group, originally composed of six player advocates, who would continue to organize sanctioned tournaments, as well as designing and releasing new &quot;virtual cards&quot; to keep the game fresh. Over two decades later, the Players&#x27; Committee still supports an active player base around the world, organizing several major tournaments each year, providing a platform for online play, and releasing new sets of virtual cards every few months.

==Gameplay==

Each game requires one player to play the light side of the Force while the other plays the dark side. In friendly play, a player can specialize in one side or the other, but for tournaments, players need both Dark and Light decks. This two-sided aspect is rare in customizable card games (Star Wars: The Card Game and Netrunner being the other notable examples). The action of the game occurs at various &quot;Location&quot; cards (both interstellar and planet-bound) familiar from the Star Wars Universe. Locations can be deployed as the game progresses; furthermore, most locations come in both Dark and Light-side versions, and an on-the-table location can be &quot;converted&quot; (changed to the other side) at any time. Most locations affect game play in some way; all also provide &quot;Force icons&quot;, which represent the amount of &quot;Force&quot; a player can activate per turn.

Force is the game&#x27;s resource and its defining trait. Each unit of &quot;Force&quot; is simply a card from the top of a player&#x27;s deck, placed off to one side in the &quot;Force Pile&quot;. When used to deploy something, each unit of Force is placed on the &quot;Used Pile&quot;, which then cycles back to the bottom of the deck. Unused Force remains in the Force Pile, and can be conserved for the next turn or drawn into the player&#x27;s hand. The objective of the game is to force the opponent to discard all of their Life Force (consisting of Reserve Deck, Force pile and Used pile). This is accomplished via &quot;Force Drains&quot; (forcing the opponent to discard cards by controlling, unopposed, a location with their Force Icons on it), battling opposing characters, and resolving certain climatic situations (for instance, freezing a character in carbonite, winning a pod race, dueling a Jedi).

The game system also features &quot;Destiny draws&quot;, which represent the elements of chance, uncertainty, luck, random chance and the Force. Each card has a destiny number, from 0 to 7, at the top-right corner (except locations, which count as destiny 0), and rather than using dice for generating random numbers, players &quot;draw destiny&quot; from the top of their deck, revealing the top card and using its destiny number as the result. This is used for a variety of purposes, from determining weapon hits to mandatory losses incurred by the opponent to resolving whether a character passes a Jedi Test. The drawn Destiny card goes to the Used Pile and is recycled into the deck. Through this system, a skillful player can legally count cards, remembering where the high-destiny cards are in the deck. Stronger (or rarer) cards generally have lower Destiny values (with some exceptions); as a result, less-experienced (or economically challenged) players are more likely to find that &quot;The Force is with [them]&quot;.

==Sets==

===Full expansion sets===
The following full sets were created by Decipher:
* Premiere (1995) - This was the first set for the &quot;Star Wars CCG&quot; and included the characters of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, C-3PO, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Vader as well as many other cards that formed the core of the game. Perhaps the most potent strategies was to pair Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin at an important location. Acting in concert, they can cancel an opponent&#x27;s destiny draw (unless Vader is targeted by Uncontrollable Fury, which was released in the Cloud City expansion). All of the card art images from this set were derived from A New Hope. This set, along with A New Hope and Hoth, were sold in booster packs of 15 cards that retailed for US$3.00.
* A New Hope (1996) - This 121-card set featured additional cards taken from the first Star Wars movie. Important debuts in this set included Chewbacca and R2-D2. Also of note were the introduction of the Death Star as a system card, the introduction of creatures, and a new mechanic that allowed for the destruction of entire planets. It was sold in 15-card booster packs.
* Hoth (November 1996) - This was the first set to include images from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. It was also the first set to introduce the mechanic of a &quot;persona&quot;, a version of a main character with alternate abilities (e.g., Commander Luke Skywalker vs. Luke Skywalker). Also included in this set were the immense AT-AT walkers. Another new rule was the &quot;Hoth Energy Shield Rules&quot; which prevents the Dark Side player from deploying his cards on the first four &quot;marker&quot; Hoth sites, and all interior Hoth sites; unless the Main Power Generators is &quot;blown away&quot;. It was a 162-card set.
* Dagobah (April 1997) - This set featured cards from the middle part of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Significant cards included Yoda, another new version of Luke (Son of Skywalker) and all of the bounty hunters (except Boba Fett), their ships, and weapons. This set was also the first to be sold in packs of 9 cards with an original retail price of US$2.50 per pack, where the last card in the pack would always be the rare card. This was to ensure that players and collectors could acquire more rare cards and fewer common and uncommon cards. When originally released, this set developed a bad reputation among players because of the introduction of many new strategies that focused the game on deck manipulation at the expense of the intense battling that had originally made the game so popular.
* Cloud City (1997) - This set is based on the final third of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and included new versions of Han Solo and Leia and also introduced Lando Calrissian as a character card in the game. He was also unique in that he had both Light Side and Dark Side personas. It also added Boba Fett to the game (although he had been available as a preview card in the First Anthology released earlier in the year). This set also introduced &quot;dueling&quot; as a major strategic mechanic for the Dark Side and provided for the possibility that Luke could be turned to the Dark Side. Cloud City also attempted to correct the abusive &quot;numbers&quot; strategies prevalent since the release of Dagobah. Due to a large print run, this set, as of 2009, is still very easy to acquire. Willrow Hood, a previously unknown character who made a two-second cameo in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; acquired a short backstory in this deck. There were 180 cards in the set (50 common, 50 uncommoon, and 80 rare) sold in 9-card booster packs.
* Jabba&#x27;s Palace (1998) - This was the first set to feature cards from &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and focused on the opening scenes of the film where the heroes tried to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt. Jabba himself was an important card, as was the new version of R2-D2 (Artoo), but overall this set was seen as being weak, especially from a tournament perspective, by players who complained that there were simply too many aliens that had little or no competitive use. This is, as of 2009, the cheapest and easiest set to purchase. The 180-card set was sold in 9-card booster packs.
* Special Edition (1998) - This was the largest set since Premiere and the first to introduce new starter decks (which included many cards that could only be found in them). This set was seen as something of an overhaul of the game since it changed some game terms and attempted to make the entire play experience more streamlined through the release of a comprehensive rulebook and glossary. The most notable addition in this set was the introduction of the &quot;objective&quot; mechanic. These cards allowed a player to start many more cards and provided a movie-based goal for a player&#x27;s deck. Many players praised this addition, arguing that it made little-used strategies (like freezing people in carbonite) useful. Others argued that it limited creativity and led to cookie-cutter decks based around various objectives that all looked and played the same. This set introduced the widely popular &quot;Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith&quot; persona.
* Endor (1999) - This was the first of two sets to focus on the latter two-thirds of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. It included a vast number of characters and vehicles that were designed to be useful in battles. Upon release, this set garnered a poor reputation because of the sheer number of ostensibly new but seemingly redundant characters and vehicles contained therein. However, its reputation improved over time, as later expansions have allowed for new decks featuring large amounts of Endor cards, and it is, as of 2009, one of the more valuable and expensive sets to purchase.
* Death Star II (2000) - This set was the second to focus on the end of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and along with Endor forms a stand-alone environment, in which all of the cards from those two expansions can be played independently of the other sets. This was also the first set to feature ultra-rare cards (Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Emperor Palpatine). The inclusion of these two very powerful and iconic characters, in addition to many useful supplementary cards, coupled with general praise for its elegant design, has given the set lasting appeal and led to it being, as of 2009, one of the more expensive sets to purchase. This set, and all after it, were sold in 11-card packs for a retail price of US$3.29.
* Tatooine (2001) - Tatooine was originally scheduled to be a set based on the Skywalker family; this idea, however, was abandoned when Decipher decided to allow for elements of the film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, the first of the prequels, to mix with the &quot;Classic Trilogy&quot; cards, at the request of Lucasfilm. Thus, this set includes Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul, Padmé Naberrie, as well as a younger version of Obi-Wan, and was heavily focused on &quot;pod racing&quot;. Anakin Skywalker was not included either in this set or the following ones to avoid problems with having both him and Darth Vader in the game (ultimately, no Anakin card was ever printed). This set, which contained fewer total cards than previous expansions, seems to have had a relatively large print run, and thus it is relatively easy and inexpensive to acquire.
* Coruscant (2001) - Coruscant focuses on events from the middle of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, especially Senatorial conflict. A very limited print run along with powerful strategies has made it by far the most expensive set and hardest to acquire. There are a number of notable cards in this set, including new versions of Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul as well as the introduction of Mace Windu.
* Theed Palace (2001) - This was the last set produced for &quot;Star Wars CCG&quot;. The most popular and notable card in this set is Darth Sidious who was, at that time, not considered by Decipher to be the same person as Emperor Palpatine or Senator Palpatine in the &quot;game universe&quot;. For gameplay reasons, these three cards remained separate personas for over 20 years, until the persona rules were overhauled in November, 2021. This set is also somewhat difficult to acquire.

Unlimited white-border editions of the sets &quot;A New Hope&quot;, &quot;Hoth&quot;, and &quot;Dagobah&quot; were released in August 1998 after their original limited edition print run had sold out.

==World Champions==

==Reception==
In the April 1996 edition of &quot;Arcane&quot; (Issue 5), Andy Butcher gave the game a top rating of 10 out of 10 despite stating that &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; is let down by two things: its rulebook and the distribution of the cards.&quot;.

In the June 1996 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 230), Rick Swan liked the &quot;first-rate presentation&quot; of the cards. But he was disappointed with gameplay, saying &quot;if only &quot;Star Wars&quot; played as good as it looked. But alas, it is merely okay.&quot; He found the rules &quot;a bit clunky&quot;. The game &quot;loses steam toward the end, when the outcome becomes all but inevitable.&quot; And he felt that the starter packs of only 60 cards made for a limited game, stating &quot;You&#x27;ll need a much larger poolI&#x27;d guess at least 100 Dark Side cards and 100 Light Sidersto make &quot;Star Wars&quot; come alive.&quot; He concluded by giving it an average rating of 3 out of 6, saying, &quot;In today&#x27;s deck-drenched market... it&#x27;s just another card game, eminently playable but nothing to squander the rent money on.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Trading Card Games For Dummies&quot; highlighted that the &quot;Decipher &quot;Star Wars: Customizable Card Game&quot; enjoyed a huge following, spawning world tournaments, gorgeous trophies, dedicated fans and a great card game. Then Decipher&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; license expires and this game, too, faded into near-obscurity. Although cards are no longer available, &quot;Star Wars&quot; still enjoys a devoted, albeit small, following. Players organize tournaments, trade, and talk about deck design, which is quite a commendation for a game that&#x27;s been out of print for several years. [...] Decipher&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; game plays very differently than its namesake published by Wizards of the Coast&quot;.

<doc id="321096" wikidata="Q1754847" url="?curid=321096" title="Microdot">
<text>A microdot is text or an image substantially reduced in size to prevent detection by unintended recipients. Microdots are normally circular and around in diameter but can be made into different shapes and sizes and made from various materials such as polyester or metal. The name comes from microdots often having been about the size and shape of a typographical dot, such as a period or the tittle of a lowercase &quot;i&quot; or &quot;j&quot;. Microdots are, fundamentally, a steganographic approach to message protection.

== History ==

In 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, Paris was under siege and messages were sent by carrier pigeon. Parisian photographer René Dagron used microfilm to permit each pigeon to carry a high volume of messages, as pigeons can carry little weight.

Improvement in technology since then has made even smaller miniaturization possible.

At the 1925 International Congress of Photography in Paris, Emanuel Goldberg presented a method of producing extreme reduction microdots using a two-stage process. First, an initial reduced negative was made, then the image of the negative was projected from the eyepiece of a modified microscope onto a collodium emulsion where the microscope specimen slide would be. The reduction was such that a page of text would be legibly reproduced in an area of 0.01 mm2. This density is comparable to the entire text of the Bible fifty times over in one square inch. Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Mikrat&quot; (microdot) was prominently reported at the time in English, French and German publications.

A technique comparable to modern microdots for steganographic purposes was first used in Germany between World War I and World War II. It was also later used by many countries to pass messages through insecure postal channels. Later microdot techniques used film with aniline dye, rather than silver halide layers, as this was even harder for counter-espionage agents to find.

A popular article on espionage by J. Edgar Hoover in the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 1946 attributed invention of microdots to &quot;the famous Professor Zapp at the Technical University Dresden&quot;. This article was reprinted, translated, and widely and uncritically cited in the literature on espionage. There never was a Professor Zapp at that university; Hoover&#x27;s Zapp has been wrongly identified with Walter Zapp, inventor of the Minox camera, which was used by spies but did not make microdots. Hoover appears to have conflated Emanuel Goldberg, who was a professor in Dresden, with Kurt Zapp who, late in the Second World War, was in Dresden and taught spies how to make microdots. A World War II spy kit for microdot production was sometimes called a Zapp outfit.

In Germany after the Berlin Wall was erected, special cameras were used to generate microdots which were then attached to letters and sent through the regular mail. These microdots often went unnoticed by inspectors, and information could be read by the intended recipient using a microscope.

==Modern usage==
Microdot identification is a process in which tiny identification tags are etched or coded with a unique serial number or, for use on vehicles, with a vehicle identification number (VIN) or asset identification number. Unique personal identification numbers (PINs), asset identification numbers, or customized customer data entries are also sometimes coded. The microdots are brushed or sprayed onto the key parts of an asset to provide complete parts marking. The technology was developed in the United States in the 1990s before being commercialized by various manufacturers and distributors around the world.

In South Africa it is a legal requirement to have a microdot fitted to all new vehicles sold since September 2012 and to all vehicles that require police clearance.

Most printers print, in addition to the document contents requested, tiny yellow dots containing the printer serial number and a time stamp. These are not microdots, but arrays of difficult-to-see dots across the printed page in an encoded pattern.

<doc id="321098" wikidata="Q983766" url="?curid=321098" title="Lalli">
<text>Lalli is an apocryphal character from Finnish history. According to the legend, he killed Bishop Henry on the ice of Köyliönjärvi on 20 January 1156.

== Legend ==
The story begins with an expedition of one of the first Christian missionaries in Finland, Bishop Henry, during the alleged first crusade of Sweden. In the midst of travelling, he and his entourage stop at a dwelling. Only the matron of the house, Kerttu, is home. Bishop Henry asks for food for his party and hay for the horses, but the matron refuses him. In their hunger, Bishop Henry and his men then forcibly take the food and hay but leave payment before continuing on with their journey. After they are gone, Lalli, the husband of Kerttu, returns and hears of what has happened. In most versions of the story, Kerttu leaves out the part of the payment entirely. When Lalli hears of the bishop ransacking his home, he becomes enraged and pursues the bishop. Lalli catches up to the bishop on a frozen lake, said to be Köyliönjärvi. At Bishop Henry&#x27;s bidding his entourage flees to a nearby forest. The bishop tries to calm the angered man, but Lalli strikes and kills Henry with an axe.

There are numerous versions as to how Lalli then met his own gruesome fate, but typically Lalli takes the bishop&#x27;s mitre to wear it pompously and cuts off the bishop&#x27;s finger to snatch his valuable ring. The mitre becomes fused to Lalli&#x27;s head and when he tries to remove it, it tears his scalp off with it. When he tries to remove the bishop&#x27;s ring from his finger, it likewise tears his finger off. Lalli runs to the woods, where mice or rats corner him up a tree. Lalli then falls from the tree into the lake Hiirijärvi and drowns. The bishop&#x27;s body parts are collected by his servants and transported with oxen towards the south. The place where the oxen stopped became the site of the first church in Finland.

The legend is enshrined in a famous Finnish folk poem called &quot;Henrikin surma&quot; (&quot;The Slaying of Henry&quot;). The poem includes such characters as a talking statue of Christ. One of the versions of the poem is found in the &quot;Kanteletar&quot;, a collection of old Finnish folk poetry.

==Cultural significance==
Lalli is a well-known figure in Finnish folklore. He has been depicted as a figure prostrated at the feet of the Bishop Henry in wooden statues. The name &quot;Lalli&quot; is not common in Finland; it may be a form of &quot;Laurentius&quot;, and is also said to be a name for the bear (traditionally saying the actual name of the animal was avoided, so the use of nicknames arose). Also, in the Finnish toponymy &quot;Lalli&quot; occurs, for example, in Pirkkala, where there is both the place name &quot;Lalli&quot; and &quot;Lallin lahti&quot; (&quot;Lalli Bay&quot;) on the shores of Lake Pyhäjärvi.

In the television series &quot;Suuret suomalaiset&quot; – the Finnish version of &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; – Lalli was chosen as the 14th greatest Finn. Lalli used to be generally viewed as an evil-doer along with his wife, but in the 20th century he also became viewed as sort of a rebel pagan against imperialism and forced conversion of the Northern Crusades.

===Satakunta===
Lalli&#x27;s axe, along with Bishop Henrik&#x27;s mitre feature in the coat of arms of the former municipality of Köyliö and now from 2015 the merged Säkylä. There is a statue of Lalli in Köyliö designed by Aimo Tukiainen, as well as two prominent relics in Satakunta: Lalli&#x27;s hut and Lalli&#x27;s tombstone. Both are, according to legend, places where Lalli took refuge after killing the bishop. Lalli&#x27;s hut is located in &quot;Lootinnummi&quot; in Köyliö. There has been no actual archeological evidence that the mound of stone was once a house, but folklore claims that it was. 13 km away from Lalli&#x27;s alleged hut is Lalli&#x27;s tombstone: a boulder by Lake Hiirijärvi said to be still damp with Lalli&#x27;s tears. This area has been called Lalli&#x27;s farm. Lake Hiirijärvi (&quot;Lake Mouse&quot;) allegedly received its name from the Lalli myth. Martti Haavio, a researcher of Finnish mythology, theorised that this was not part of the original story, but added later on. It is possible that the legends marking these areas as Lalli&#x27;s settlements were manufactured by the church, as it would grant them rights to the land.

=== In modern popular culture ===
The story of Lalli and Henry’s death on the lake is the subject of the song &quot;Köyliönjärven jäällä&quot;, by Finnish metal band Moonsorrow.

==Historicity==

Although often considered a fictional story as there are no records of a Bishop Henry (as pointed out in research by historian Tuomas Heikkilä), new research by linguist Mikko Heikkilä claims that Bishop Henry was in fact a German missionary named Heinrich. He claims to have found records that state a missionary by the name of Heinrich (or &quot;Heinärikki&quot; as called by Finns) was slain in the early 12th century, only a few decades before the Bishop Henry of legend. According to him the fictional character of Bishop Henry was mostly based on Heinrich but was then conflated with the legend of Eric IX of Sweden, who is also storied to have met his end gruesomely murdered. Tuomas Heikkilä doubts this version of the events and states that Mikko Heikkilä combines different sources liberally.

<text>Gino Raymond Michael Cappelletti (March 26, 1934 – May 12, 2022) was an American professional football player. He played college football for the Minnesota Golden Gophers and was an All-Star in the American Football League (AFL) for the Boston Patriots, winning the 1964 AFL Most Valuable Player Award. Cappelletti is a member of the Patriots Hall of Fame, and the Patriots&#x27; All-1960s Team. He served as the Patriots&#x27; radio color commentator until July 2012. His nicknames included &quot;the Duke&quot; and &quot;Mr. Patriot&quot;.

==Early life==
Cappelletti was born in Keewatin in northern Minnesota, on March 26, 1934. He attended Keewatin High school in his hometown, and was employed on the railroad and in iron ore mines during his teenage years, also dating Patricia Morris. He went on to play college football at the University of Minnesota, where he was a quarterback, backing up All-American Paul Giel. Cappelletti kicked extra points, but the Golden Gophers did not kick field goals in those years. However, as a sophomore in 1952, Cappelletti talked the coach into letting him try a game-winning 43-yard kick against Iowa.

As a senior in 1954, Cappelletti switched to T-quarterback and led Minnesota to a 7–2 record, missing the final game with an elbow injury, a 27–0 loss at Wisconsin. He was named to the All-Big Ten second-team, but was not selected in the 1955 NFL draft.

==Professional football career==
===Canada===
Cappelletti played quarterback for the Sarnia Imperials of the Ontario Rugby Football Union in Canada during 1955. He joined Toronto Balmy Beach in 1956, but was drafted into the U.S. Army in mid-season, returning to Canada in 1958. Cappelletti signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL, but was traded to the Saskatchewan Roughriders, was later cut, and went back to the ORFU, leading the Sarnia Golden Bears (the team having changed its name in 1956) to the league championship.

===Boston Patriots===
Cappelletti was out of professional football in 1959, back in Minnesota working as a bartender in his brother&#x27;s lounge when he asked the Patriots for a tryout in the summer of 1960. With the launch of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960, he joined the Boston Patriots and was initially a kicker and defensive back. He switched to offense late in that season and teamed up with quarterback Babe Parilli to form a tandem nicknamed &quot;Grand Opera Twins&quot;, due to their Italian surnames. Cappelletti won AFL MVP honors in 1964, led the league in scoring five times and was a five-time AFL All-Star. One of 20 AFL players active during the entirety of the league&#x27;s ten-year existence, Cappelletti, George Blanda, and Jim Otto were the only players who played in every one of his team&#x27;s AFL games. He played with the Patriots all 11 years in Boston, from 1960 through the 1970 NFL merger season, and retired in late August 1971 at age 37; he was the AFL&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 1,130 points (42 TDs, 176 FGs and 342 PATs) and among the AFL&#x27;s top ten all-time receivers in yards and in receptions. Cappelletti had two of the top five scoring seasons in pro football history, with 155 points in 1964 and 147 points in 1961 (14-game seasons). His Patriots team scoring record lasted until it was broken by Adam Vinatieri on December 5, 2005. At the time of his death, Cappelletti was the Patriots&#x27; 12th all-time leading receiver in receptions with 292 catches and 10th in receiving yards with 4,589 yards. He was 5th in Patriots history in receiving touchdowns with 42, and had the second-most field goal attempts (333) in team history behind Stephen Gostkowski.

During Cappelletti&#x27;s pro career, he also returned punts and kickoffs, played defensive back and even had one pass completion for a touchdown. He was the second AFL player to record three interceptions (off Tom Flores) in a regular-season game, scored 18 points or more in a game ten times and scored 20 or more points in a game eight times. He set the AFL single-game record by scoring 28 points in the Patriots&#x27; 42–14 rout of Houston on December 18, 1965. Cappelletti is the only player in professional football history to run for a two-point conversion, throw for a two-point conversion, catch a pass, intercept a pass, return a punt and return a kickoff in the same season. He kicked six field goals (without a miss) in a 39–10 win at Denver on October 4, 1964, and became one of only two AFL kickers with at least four field goals per game for three consecutive games. Cappelletti led the AFL in field-goal percentage in 1965.

Cappelletti&#x27;s entire career with the Patriots was spent playing home games at Fenway Park. To avoid interfering with spectator views, both home and visiting teams shared the same sideline along Fenway&#x27;s left field wall, an arrangement that sometimes led to players wandering to the opposing team&#x27;s bench to eavesdrop on play calls. After his retirement, he told an interviewer that during one game against the Kansas City Chiefs he remembered coach Hank Stram &quot;...calling for screen passes and us yelling to our defense about what was coming.&quot;

In 1984, Cappelletti was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. He was inducted to the New England Patriots Hall of Fame in 1992. His No. 20 was retired by the team. However, he was not selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame at the time of his death. He was part of the inaugural class of the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in 2003.

==Broadcasting==
Cappelletti worked alongside Gil Santos as a color commentator for the Patriots&#x27; radio broadcasts on the New England Patriots Radio Network (in the 1988–90 period he worked alongside Dale Arnold). The Santos–Cappelletti duo lasted 28 seasons, the longest radio tandem in modern NFL history. They called 585 regular-season and postseason games together, including six Super Bowls.

Cappelletti also served as color commentator for the Boston College Eagles during the famous &quot;Hail Flutie&quot; game in 1984. Cappelletti can be heard supporting Dan Davis&#x27; now-famous call by yelling &quot;He got it! He got it! I don&#x27;t believe it!&quot;

On July 20, 2012, Cappelletti announced his retirement from broadcasting.

==Personal life==
Cappelletti was the father-in-law of ex–Boston College and Chicago Bears receiver Tom Waddle. He was not related to running back John Cappelletti of Penn State, the Heisman Trophy winner in 1973. Cappelletti died on May 12, 2022, at the age of 88.

<text>Ronald E. Burton (July 25, 1936 – September 13, 2003) was an American football player in the American Football League (AFL) for the Boston Patriots. He was a consensus All-American running back at Northwestern University, and is a member of the Northwestern Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
===Northwestern Wildcats===
Burton was a star on Ara Parseghian&#x27;s late 1950s Northwestern Wildcats football teams. Named all-Big Ten in 1958 and 1959, and All-America in 1959, Burton left Northwestern having broken school records for most points in a career (130), most points in a season (76), most touchdowns in a career (21). Burton led Northwestern in all-purpose yards in 1957, 1958, and 1959. Burton finished 10th in the 1959 Heisman Trophy balloting.

===Boston Patriots===
Burton was the Boston Patriots&#x27; first-ever American Football League draft choice in 1960. He was the first Patriot to rush for over 100 yards: 127 against the Denver Broncos on October 23, 1960, as well as numerous other firsts for the Patriots. His 91-yard touchdown return on a missed field goal in 1962 remains a Patriot record. He compiled 1,009 combined yards in rushing and receiving in 1962, and provided strong depth at running back for the Patriots from 1960 through 1965.

<doc id="321109" wikidata="Q445541" url="?curid=321109" title="Edmundo (footballer)">
<text>Edmundo Alves de Souza Oliveira (born 2 April 1971), better known simply as Edmundo, is a Brazilian football pundit and retired footballer who played as a forward. Nicknamed &quot;O Animal&quot;, he was a talented yet controversial footballer and drew attention both for his skill, as well as for his volatile behaviour, both on and off the pitch.

Edmundo started his professional career in Vasco da Gama in 1991, making his debut in 1992, where he won the Cariocão Grupo A in 1992. In 1993, he signed with Palmeiras, where he was part of the team that won the Brasileirão Série A in 1993 and 1994 and the Paulistão Série A1 in 1993, which ended the club&#x27;s 17-year major title drought, and 1994, with a loan spell at Parma in 2000. In 1995, he moved to Flamengo and in 1996, after a loan spell in Corinthians, he returned to Vasco da Gama, where he won the Brasileirão Série A in 1997, netting 29 goals in 28 games, breaking the then Brasileirão Série A scoring record for a season. In 1998, he moved to Italian club Fiorentina. In 1999, he returned to Vasco da Gama. After loans to Santos and Napoli and a spell at Cruzeiro, in 2001, he moved to Japan, where he played in Tokyo Verdy and Urawa Red Diamonds. In 2003, he moved to Vasco da Gama, and after spells at Fluminense, Nova Iguaçu, Figueirense and Palmeiras, he returned to Vasco da Gama in 2008, where he retired, returning in 2012 to a testimonial match.

Edmundo played for Brazil national team from 1992 to 2000. He played the World Cup in 1998, where Brazil reached the final and finished runner-up. He played three Copa América editions, in 1993, 1995 and 1997, winning the 1997 and finished runner-up in 1995. He also played the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 1998.

==Club career==

===Vasco da Gama===
Born in Niterói, Edmundo played for several clubs throughout his career, both in his native country of Brazil and abroad. However, the history of Edmundo, as a football player, is strongly intertwined with Vasco da Gama. He began his career with the club in the amateur divisions in 1982, also later playing for the Botafogo youth side before returning to the club. He went on to make his debut as professional with the Vasco da Gama senior side, where he remained until 1992.

He returned to the club in 1996, and in 1997, when Vasco won the Brasileirão Série A, he was the season&#x27;s top scorer, his twenty-nine goals breaking a record set by Reinaldo of Atlético Mineiro twenty years earlier. In that same year, Vasco da Gama scored sixty-nine goals. That season, Edmundo was named the league&#x27;s player of the year. He also scored six goals in a match against União São João. After moving between several clubs abroad, he returned to Vasco da Gama in 1999, where he joined his international team-mate Romário and was initially handed the captain&#x27;s armband, reaching the final of the 2000 Club World Championship, defeating Manchester United in the process; he was later kicked off the team in 2000 by vice-president Eurico Miranda for lack of discipline, however, after he left the dressing-room before a game. He returned to Vasco da Gama again in 2003, where he remained until the end of the season when was released after scoring only seven goals in nineteen appearances. He returned to Vasco da Gama in 2008, when he played the last season of his career. In total, he made 127 appearances with the club.

Regarding his attachment to the club, Edmundo stated that his love for Vasco da Gama was like that between a son and his mother. On 28 March 2012, he played his testimonial match when Vasco da Gama hosted Barcelona de Guayaquil in a friendly match. The game ended 9–1 with Edmundo scoring twice.

===Career in Brazil===
In 1993, Edmundo left Vasco da Gama and transferred to Palmeiras, where he won the Brasileirão twice, in 1993 and 1994, scoring thirty-four goals in eighty-nine appearances for the club. Despite his success, he had several disputes with his manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo, and was involved in an altercation with his team-mate Antônio Carlos, which led to Edmundo being sacked by the club. On 27 June 1995 he joined Flamengo who paid Palmeiras 5.5 million dollars, one of the highest transfer fees in Brazilian football. However he stayed in Flamengo for a season in 1995 (two goals in fourteen appearances), and subsequently signed for Corinthians in 1996, although he failed to make an appearance for the club, as he reportedly stormed out of a training session after an argument. He later joined Santos on loan in 2000 (scoring thirteen goals in twenty appearances), and Cruzeiro in 2001 (three goals in thirteen appearances). After another spell at Vasco da Gama, he joined Fluminense in 2004, scoring seven goals in twenty appearances, and also scored one goal in two appearances whilst playing for Nova Iguaçu in 2005.

===Time in Italy, return to Brazil and Japan===
In 1997, Italian club Fiorentina purchased Edmundo for 13 billion lire (approx. 8 million dollars at the time), and he remained with the team until 1999. Despite putting on some spectacular performances during his tenure in Florence, which initially endeared him with the fans, his stint in Italy was also marked by inconsistency and controversy, which drew criticism from the press. One particular incident which drew much publicity occurred during the 1998–99 season, under manager Giovanni Trapattoni; Edmundo left the club midway through the season in order to attend the Rio Carnival. Although at that point Fiorentina were first in the league, due to his absence, as well as strike partner Gabriel Batistuta&#x27;s injury, Fiorentina missed out on the league title at the end of the season, and as a result, Edmundo had a falling out with the club, his manager, and his team-mates.

In April 1999, he returned to Vasco da Gama, who paid Fiorentina a record 23 billion lire (payable in two installments). There, he created a lethal partnership in attack with Romário with whom they were not in speaking terms. Edmundo captained Vasco at the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, where they reached the final only to lose to Corinthians on penalties, with him missing the decisive kick.

In January 2001, he was sent out on loan to Napoli, where he remained until June. He was injured during his debut with the club against Udinese however, which kept him sidelined, and was unable to prevent the club&#x27;s relegation to Serie B at the end of the season.

Later that year, he joined J1 League club Tokyo Verdy, scoring eighteen goals in thirty-one appearances, and remaining with the club until 2002. He joined Japanese club Urawa Red Diamonds in 2003, but did not make a single appearance for the team.

===Later years===
During the end of his career, Edmundo still managed to perform well, despite not being as physically strong or fit as he had been during his prime in the mid-90s, although his performances became increasingly less consistent with age. Nevertheless, his football skills and goalscoring proved to be fundamental in helping Figueirense avoid relegation in the 2005 Brasileirão Série A, as he managed fifteen goals in thirty-one appearances. The following season, he also saved Palmeiras from relegation during the 2006 Brasileirão Série A.

Along with Jorge Valdivia and Marcos, Edmundo was one of the most important footballers for Palmeiras during the 2007 season; however, his contract was not renewed at the end of the season. There are two versions of this fact: according to the &quot;official&quot; one, his salary was too high for his irregular performances. But it is more possible that the actual reason was that Caio Júnior, who was favorable to this permanence, was sacked and Vanderlei Luxemburgo, who has personal problems with Edmundo, was hired.

In January 2008, Edmundo returned to Vasco da Gama, although he was not able to prevent the club&#x27;s relegation to the 2009 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B. Edmundo announced retirement from football on 30 May 2008, but he returned to play until the end of 2008 season.

==International career==
At international level, Edmundo made forty-two appearances for Brazil between 1992 and 2000, scoring ten goals. He was a member of the team that won the 1997 Copa América, and also made two substitute appearances at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, including the final where the team lost 3–0 to hosts France and finished in second place. Additionally, Edmundo was a member of the Brazil squad that took part at the 1993 and 1995 Copa América tournaments, winning a runners-up medal in the latter edition; he also won a bronze medal at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Furthermore, he took part in two exhibition tournaments with the Brazil national side, winning the 1995 Umbro Cup, and finishing second in the 1997 Tournoi de France. Despite his talent, however, Edmundo&#x27;s turbulent lifestyle off the pitch, as well as extensive competition from several world-class Brazilian forwards at the time (including Bebeto, Romário, and Ronaldo), are thought to have limited his playing time at international level.

==Style of play==
Edmundo was a quick, powerful, creative, and technically gifted player, who was known for his pace, strength, acceleration, and his outstanding dribbling skills, as well as his use of feints, including the &quot;Pelé runaround move&quot;; as a second striker, he was capable of both scoring and assisting many goals. A versatile forward, Edmundo played primarily as a second striker, but was capable to play as a winger or even as a main striker or attacking midfielder. Despite his talent, he was also a tenacious and controversial footballer, who was criticised for his poor work-rate and lack of consistency at times; he was also known for his aggression and poor behaviour on the pitch, which often led him to pick up cards, and earned him the nickname &quot;&#x27;&quot;O Animal&quot; (&quot;The Animal&quot;).

==Outside football==
In the middle of 2009, Edmundo became a football pundit for Rede TV!. In the beginning of 2010, Rede Bandeirantes hired him; he was part of the broadcaster&#x27;s journalistics team in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012 coverages.

==Controversies==
Known for his tenacious style of play and aggressive behaviour, as well as his skill on the pitch, Edmundo was also involved in several incidents off the pitch throughout his career; he had several disagreements with his managers and officials, and was known for his &quot;partying&quot;. In 1999, he faced prosecution by animal welfare groups after hiring an entire circus to perform in his back garden to celebrate his son&#x27;s first birthday. At the party, he was accused by some individuals of the press of encouraging a chimpanzee called Pedrinho to be drunk on beer and whiskey. Subsequent images of this appeared in the media (including the February 2004 issue of the UK version of &quot;FHM&quot; magazine) and have passed into football legend. The same year, during his turbulent time with Fiorentina, he also escaped a four-year prison sentence for driving drunk and crashing his car during the Rio Carnival of 1995, resulting in the deaths of three people; for his behaviour he received a seven-day suspended sentence. In 1998, due to his difficult relationship with the Florentine club, he suddenly left for the Rio Carnival halfway through the season, and was two days late in returning to Florence according to the Italian newspaper &quot;Il&quot; &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;.

<text>The Fiat X1/9 is an Italian two-seater mid-engined sports car designed by Bertone and manufactured by Fiat from 1972–1982 and subsequently by Gruppo Bertone from 1982–1989.

With a transverse engine and gearbox in a mid-mounted, rear-wheel drive configuration, the X1/9 was noted for its balanced handling, retractable headlights, lightweight removable hardtop which could be stowed under the bonnet, front and rear storage compartments — and for being the first Fiat to have been designed from its conception to meet US safety regulations.

==History==

===Design and development===

The X1/9 was developed from the 1969 Autobianchi A112 Runabout concept, with styling by Bertone under chief designer Marcello Gandini.

Even though the Runabout was named for the Autobianchi A112, it was powered by a version of the brand new Fiat 128 SOHC engine. The Runabout featured a distinctive wedge shape and took many styling cues from contemporary power-boat design. Though the more extreme features of the Runabout such as the C pillar mounted headlights and the small wind-deflector windscreen were lost for the production car, many aesthetic features of the Autobianchi Runabout are readily identifiable on the X1/9. The long flat bonnet with central indentation, the large front overhang, the wedge shape with prominent C-pillar roll-over hoop and the car-length indented waterline all made the successful transition to the X1/9, giving it a highly distinctive appearance.

Designed around the Fiat SOHC engine and transmission from the front wheel drive Fiat 128, the X1/9 relocated the transverse drive train and suspension assembly from the front of the 128 to the rear of the passenger cabin, directly in front of the rear axle, giving a mid-engined layout. The engine was designed by Aurelio Lampredi, famed Ferrari engine designer before he went to work for FIAT (the parent company, at that time). The fuel tank and spare wheel were located ahead of the engine, behind the driver and passenger seats respectively — optimizing the proportion of the car&#x27;s weight within its wheelbase for more balanced handling and enabling cargo areas front and rear.

Once developed for production, the two-seater featured sharp-edged styling with a wedge shape, retractable headlights, an integrated front spoiler and a removable hard top roof panel (targa top). The removable hardtop could be stored in the front boot; a second luggage compartment was provided at the rear of the car, accessible through a conventional boot lid.

Unlike Fiat&#x27;s marketing nomenclature at the time which used a numerical system (e.g., 127, 128, 124, 131) denoting relative position in the model range, the X1/9 retained its prototype code as its marketing name. Fiat&#x27;s prototype coding used &quot;X0&quot; for engines, &quot;X1&quot; for passenger vehicles and &quot;X2&quot; for commercial vehicles. The X1/9 was thus the ninth passenger car developed using the nomenclature.

===Production and model evolution===
Originally slated to debut at the November 1972 Turin Motor Show, the X1/9&#x27;s launch was delayed until after the show to avoid upstaging the new Fiat 126 city car. Press test drives were held at the end of November 1972, on the Sicilian Madonie roads home to the Targa Florio road race.The car was intended to replace the 850 Spider, another Bertone design, not the larger and pricier 124 Sport Spider whose production continued for much of the X1/9&#x27;s life. The car&#x27;s monocoque body was produced at the Bertone factory in Grugliasco (Turin) and then transported to the Fiat&#x27;s Lingotto factory for final assembly. As mentioned before, the X1/9&#x27;s type &quot;128 AS&quot; single overhead cam straight-four engine was derived from the Fiat 128, specifically from the 128 Coupé 1300.

Changes included a new cast aluminium oil sump, complementing the aluminium cylinder head. With a twin-choke Weber 32 DMTR carburettor and an 8.9:1 compression ratio, the engine produced at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 3,400 rpm. The all-synchronized 4-speed transmission was also carried over from the 128, though with a taller fourth gear ratio to exploit the sports car&#x27;s better aerodynamics. As a consequence the X1/9 had a top speed of over , 10 km/h higher than the similarly engined but 65 kg lighter 128 Coupé 1300.

As standard the X1/9 came with 4.5J×13-inch stamped steel wheels fitted with tyres, while cast alloy wheels were an extra-cost option.

Suspension was fully independent, with MacPherson struts front and rear. The split circuit brake system used equally sized solid discs all around. Steering was rack and pinion.

The interior, upholstered in leatherette, featured two bucket seats with integrated headrests and a four-spoke steering wheel (resembling the one fitted to the Lamborghini Marzal). The engine cover and rear trunk could be opened with (lockable) interior latches located on the driver&#x27;s side door jamb.

The original 1.3-litre, 4-speed X1/9 can be distinguished from the later 1.5-litre, 5-speed model by its wrap-around steel split bumpers with rubber blocks, and the shallower engine compartment lid.

Fiat began marketing a right-hand drive variant in 1976. Prior to this, Radbourne Racing had been converting left-hand drive X1/9s to a right-hand drive configuration for sale in the UK market. None of these early conversions are believed to remain in existence.

In 1982, shortly after the introduction of the 1500 model, complete production was assumed by Bertone with models subsequently badged as the &quot;Bertone&quot; X1/9. Bertone models featured revised footwells redesigned to enhance legroom and sitting comfort for persons taller than the original design&#x27;s target.

The last production models were named the Gran Finale and sold over the 1989/1990 period. They were a dealer modification of the special edition (commonly abbreviated to SE) of 1988/1989, with the addition of a rear spoiler and &quot;gran finale&quot; badges.

====The X1/9 in the United States====
Reported numbers vary by source, but about 2/3 of the approximately 160,000 X1/9s produced were sold in the USA. Three generations of X1/9 were sold in the U.S.: 1974 cars, 1975-1978 cars, and 1979-1989 cars.

The 1974 U.S. examples aligned closely with worldwide models, including small (but U.S.-specific) bumpers, 1290 cc engines, and four-speed transmissions.

The 1975-1978 U.S. cars were unique to the U.S. market with &quot;ladder-style&quot; impact absorbing bumpers front and rear. To meet U.S. evaporative and exhaust emission standards, X1/9s were fitted with exhaust gas recirculation valves, air pumps and activated charcoal systems. These cars were rated at .

In 1979 U.S. cars received increases in displacement to 1498 cc and five-speed transmissions, with max power up to . The 1979 U.S. cars retained the previous emission controls. Model years 1980 and 1981 saw a transition from carburetion to Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection, with the changeover coming in 1980 for cars sold in California and a gradual changeover for &quot;federal&quot; cars from late 1980 to 1981 model years. The combination of fuel injection (FI), a catalytic converter and unleaded gasoline allowed these cars to meet California&#x27;s and later federal emission standards. Fuel injected cars were rated at .
In 1979 U.S. X1/9s also received both exterior and interior revisions including integrated bumpers front and rear, as well as new front grilles and airdams. The instrument panel and dash redesign moved the heating and ventilation controls from the center console up to the main dash, relocated the radio to the center dash area, moved the fuse panel from the area above the driver&#x27;s left knee to the area above the passenger&#x27;s footwell where the glovebox was, and moved the glovebox to atop the dash.

During 1982, Fiat ended its presence in the U.S. Fiat turned over marketing and support of the X1/9 to International Automobile Importers, Inc., headed by Malcolm Bricklin, and turned over full production duties to Bertone.

In 1983 the orphaned X1/9 was sold as the &quot;Bertone X1/9&quot;. IAI and Bertone continued to update the X1/9, providing improved rust protection, revised seating to accommodate taller drivers, and a modernized electrical system for 1984 models.

U.S. sales of the X1/9 fell in the final few years, and 1987 was the last year that IAI imported X1/9s to the U.S.

From mid-1987 to end of the production in 1989, Bertone X1/9s were imported to the U.S. by M.I.K. Automotive, Inc. in North Hollywood, California, owned by Miro Kefurt, who at that time was the number one Bertone dealer in the U.S. and one of the very few that sold exclusively X1/9s. The last four X1/9s were imported to the U.S. in April 1990 (1989 model year cars, produced in December 1989).

== Technical specifications ==
==Concept cars and prototypes==

Bertone conducted at least three design and engineering studies with the X1/9. Along with several standard X1/9s taken from the production line, examples of all three design studies are now on display in the Volandia Museum adjacent to the Malpensa/Milan airport, which is the new home of the majority of the Bertone collection that was sold after the company went through final bankruptcy proceedings.
=== Fiat X1/9 Superlight ===
An all-aluminum X1/9 body shell was developed in concert with ALCAN. Five all-aluminum cars, dubbed &quot;Superlight&quot; (not Superleggera), were built to the same strength and stiffness of the normal steel cars, and tested for vibration, noise, high load input, and corrosion. The program also tested the specially developed adhesives and techniques used to assemble bodyshell components. Weight savings were 1/3 of the normal steel body. Since a 24-hour Showroom Stock endurance race was expected to reveal a lot about the durability of aluminum cars, one of these aluminum-bodied prototypes was entered into the 1987 Longest Day of Nelson Ledges race, but a mishap on a test and tune practice lap prevented the car from running the race.

=== Fiat X1/9 &quot;Passo Lungo&quot; ===
The second design study was a 2+1 completed in 1981, dubbed &quot;Passo Lungo.&quot; of width was added to the entire car, and more than of length was added behind the door and ahead of the rear wheels. The spare tire was relocated to the new space behind the driver&#x27;s seat, and a third seat was added to the space behind the passenger seat originally used for the spare tire. &quot;Opera&quot; windows were added to the sail panels. The stock 1.5L engine was replaced by the 2.0L DOHC FIAT engine to add more power to compensate for the added weight.

The X1/9 &quot;Passo Lungo&quot; was based on a European specification 1500 Fiat X/19 with a stretched wheelbase of to accommodate a back seat, usable only by small children. Only one example is known to exist which is currently on display with the Bertone collection in Volandia. In stretching the body, the targa roof also had to be made longer and could no longer be stowed in the front boot of the car (as it had been designed for in the normal X1/9).

=== Fiat X1/9 Spider ===
The third study was a full-convertible top (Spider) version of the X1/9. The fixed rear window and sail panels were deleted, and a more conventional roll bar/hoop was added for rollover protection. A fascia was fabricated to mate with the engine compartment lid to cover the body shoulders where the sails panels used to be. The convertible top is not a structure that emerges from behind the passenger compartment area; rather it is a flexible cover that mounts using the original targa top clips along the windshield in front, stretches over and is supported by the new roll bar, and is secured into place in the rear with twist-clips.

==Racing==

===Filipinetti===
The Filipinetti X1/9 of Scuderia Filipinetti was presented first at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1973 as the first Fiat X1/9 race car. It was built in cooperation with Fiat by the technician and racer Mike Parkes who later developed and built the Lancia Stratos. The Filipinetti had a 1290 cc engine with Lucas mechanical fuel injection and a Colotti five-speed gearbox. The power was about at 8600 rpm with a top speed of .

===Abarth===
The Fiat subsidiary Abarth, in 1973, developed the Abarth X1/9 Prototipo to replace the 124 Spider Abarth as Fiat&#x27;s main rally car. Ultimately, the parallel 131 Abarth project was chosen over the X1/9 as the main rally competition platform.

The X1/9 Prototipo used an 1840 cc engine (a bored out 1600 cc 124-derived unit) with a custom 16-valve cylinder head fed by twin 44 mm Weber IDF carburettors. Externally the cars sported flared wheel-arches, a small &quot;duck tail&quot; spoiler and an F1 style air intake designed to feed the carburettors cool air from above the cars roof. All the X1/9 Prototipos were raced in the traditional Abarth lime-green/yellow and orange/pink colour scheme.

The prototype nature of the X1/9 Prototipo project means that the exact number of cars produced is impossible to define. Components and entire body-shells were routinely swapped and replaced as part of the development process, but it is believed that 5 genuine cars were produced.

===Dallara Icsunonove===
In 1975 the X1/9 was chosen by Dallara to enter the World Championship for Makes in the Group 5 Special Production class. The Dallara Icsunonove (the Italian pronunciation of &quot;X1/9&quot;) featured a modified X1/9 engine with a custom 16-valve cylinder-head and fundamental suspension and body/monocoque alterations, the most obvious of which are the massively flared wheel-arches and the oversized rear wing.

==Kit conversions==

===Faran===
The Faran Car Co. Ltd. was a UK based company that offered their Eliminator kit in both DIY and in-house assembled form. The design featured replacement fibreglass mouldings for the front and rear wings together with front and rear integrated bumper sections. The external modifications were completed by side sill skirts and a rear boot spoiler not dissimilar in style to that found on a De Tomaso Pantera. Faran also offered conversions using Lancia or Fiat Twin Cam engine units, although some owners opted to keep the original SOHC setup. Production of the Faran kits ended following a factory fire.

===Eurosport===
Eurosport (UK) Ltd. is an X1/9 parts specialist that produced two kit variants commonly referred to as the full and bolt-on kits. The full kit was a contender to the Faran version and utilises wide replacement fibreglass moldings for the front and rear wings, together with front and rear integrated bumper sections. Side skirts completed the styling which featured Ferrari Testarossa style side air intake mouldings ahead of the rear wheels. The bolt-on kit in contrast featured replacement front and rear integrated bumper sections that were moulded to blend with the standard wings. This allowed the 1500 alloy bumpers to be substituted with ease and offer a more modern appearance. Side sill skirts were also included in the bolt-on kit. Both kits are still available today.

===Schult===
The Schult X1/9 kit was produced in Germany and could again be likened to have taken some inspiration from the Testarossa style, but with more angular lines. Current availability for the Schult conversion is unknown.

== The X1/9 Today ==

=== UK ===
As of 2022, 237 X1/9s are road legal in the UK. There is, however, an active owners club and with over 1,000 registered SORN there is plenty of scope for this to increase. The club produces a quarterly magazine, attends and organises events, and provides advice on the maintenance of the car.

=== USA and Canada ===
While over 100,000 of the approximately 160,000 X1/9s produced by Fiat and Bertone were sold in the USA and Canada, according to the latest available figures (from the Q3 of 2018), 1,034 X1/9s were legally plated for road operation in the USA and 115 were legally plated for road operation in Canada.

==Notes==
: The correct Italian pronunciation of X1/9 is &quot;Icsunonove&quot;: &#x27;x&#x27; (ics) &#x27;one&#x27; (uno) &#x27;nine&#x27; (nove); phonetically iks-oo-no-nov-eh. The typical English pronunciation is &#x27;x-one-nine&#x27;.

<doc id="321112" wikidata="Q911" url="?curid=321112" title="Ufa">
<text>Ufa ( ; ; , ) is the largest city in and the capital of Bashkortostan, Russia. The city lies at the confluence of the Belaya and Ufa rivers, in the centre-north of Bashkortostan, on hills forming the Ufa Plateau to the west of the southern Ural Mountains, with a population of over 1.1 million residents, up to 1.4 million residents in the urban agglomeration. Ufa is the tenth-most populous city in Russia, and the fourth-most populous city in the Volga Federal District.

The city was founded in 1574, when a fortress was built on the site by the order of Ivan the Terrible. Ufa was made capital of Ufa Governorate in 1865 when the governorate split from Orenburg Governorate. Ufa&#x27;s population expanded during the early 20th century.

Today, Ufa&#x27;s economy consists primarily of the oil refining, chemistry, and mechanical engineering industries; the petroleum company Bashneft and several of its subsidiaries are headquartered in Ufa. Ufa is an ethnically diverse city, home to a substantial number of ethnic Bashkirs and Tatars, with an ethnic Russian majority population. Several educational institutions are located in Ufa, including Bashkir State University, Ufa State Aviation Technical University, Ufa State Petroleum Technological University, and Ural State Law University. The city hosted separate summits of the BRICS group as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in 2015.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ufa&quot; comes from the Ufa River on which the city lies, but the origin of the river&#x27;s name is disputed. The Russian linguist Aleksandr Matveyev proposes that the name is of Iranian origin, from &quot;ap&quot;, meaning water.

In a paper published in 2014, researchers Karimov and Khabibov from Bashkir State Pedagogical University present and argue for a hypothesis according to which before the construction of the foundational Russian fortress in 1574, which has since grown to become the current city of Ufa, there had already been an ancient settlement called Ufa on a hilltop near the mouth of the Ufa River. According to them, this settlement was founded by Turkic-speaking tribes to perform rituals and sacrifices to the sky god Tengri, and they called this place Upe or Ufe because, they argue, in ancient Turkic languages a place of ritual sacrifice used to be called an &quot;opo&quot; or an &quot;ope.&quot; They further hypothesize that the inhabitants of the settlement themselves also came to be called the Upe or Ufe tribe and subsequently, the river along which they flourished and expanded their settlement towards its source also came to be called Ufa. Karimov and Khabibov claim that the Russian fortress builders were probably aware of this ancient name and consequently named their new settlement Ufa. 

It is colloquially called City of Three Screws due to unusual nature of city&#x27;s name in Bashkir.

==History==
Early history of the surrounding area of Ufa dates back to Paleolithic times. Presumably, from the 5th to 16th centuries there was a medieval city on the site of Ufa. On the Pizzigano brothers&#x27; map (1367) and on the Catalan Atlas (1375) a town approximately on the Belaya River was designated Pascherti (Bashkort), and Gerardus Mercator&#x27;s map (1554) also marked the settlement with the name Pascherti. French orientalist Henri Cordier associates the position of Pascherti with the current location of Ufa.

Ibn Khaldun called the town, among the largest cities of the Golden Horde, Bashkort.

Russian historian of the 18th century Peter Rychkov wrote that there was a great city on the territory of Ufa before the arrival of the Russians.

The official of the Orenburg Governorate government Vasily Rebelensky wrote that Ufa was founded by the Bashkirs.
By order of Ivan the Terrible a fortress was built on the site of modern Ufa in 1574, and originally bore the name of the hill it stood on, &quot;Tura-Tau&quot;. 1574 is now considered to be the official date of Ufa&#x27;s foundation. Town status was granted to it in 1586.

Before becoming the seat of a separate Ufa Governorate in 1781, the city, along with the rest of the Bashkir lands, was under the jurisdiction of the Orenburg governors. And even though the 1796 reform reunited Orenburg and Ufa again, in 1802, the city of Ufa became a new center of the entire Orenburg Governorate that included large territories of modern-day Republic of Bashkortostan, Orenburg Oblast, and Chelyabinsk Oblast.

Suspended substances (dust) are measured at all nine posts of the state observation network. The results of observations of the pollutants content are presented on the official website of the Bashkir State Hydrometeorological Service in the section &quot;Monitoring of environmental pollution&quot; daily and monthly. In 2017, the maximum single concentration of suspended solids reached 4.6 MPC m. in March 2017, at the address: Oktyabrya Ave., 141, located near the motorway with heavy traffic, and in April 2017 at the post: Dostoyevsky St., 102/1, located in the area of the industrial enterprise. During 2017 almost all posts of the state observation network recorded exceedances of a single concentration of suspended substances.

<text>Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, sometimes abbreviated to neohesperidin DC or simply NHDC, is an artificial sweetener derived from citrus.

It is particularly effective in masking the bitter tastes of other compounds found in citrus, including limonin and naringin. Industrially, it is produced by extracting neohesperidin from the bitter orange, and then hydrogenating this to make NHDC.

==Discovery==

NHDC was discovered during the 1960s as part of a United States Department of Agriculture research program to find methods for minimizing the taste of bitter flavorants in citrus juices. Neohesperidin is one such bitter compound. When treated with potassium hydroxide or another strong base, and then catalytically hydrogenated, it becomes NHDC.

== Profile ==
NHDC in pure form is found as a white substance not unlike powdered sugar. It has an intense sweet taste because it stimulates the sweet receptor TAS1R2+TAS1R3 in humans, although this is species-dependent, as the equivalent receptor in rats does not respond to the molecule.

It is roughly 1500–1800 times sweeter than sugar at threshold concentrations; around 340 times sweeter than sugar. Its potency is naturally affected by such factors as the application in which it is used, and the pH of the product.

Like other highly sweet glycosides, such as glycyrrhizin and those found in stevia, NHDC&#x27;s sweet taste has a slower onset than sugar&#x27;s and lingers in the mouth for some time.

Unlike aspartame, NHDC is stable to elevated temperatures and to acidic or basic conditions, and so can be used in applications that require a long shelf life. NHDC itself can stay foodsafe for up to five years when stored in optimal conditions.

The product is well known for having a strong synergistic effect when used in conjunction with other artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, and cyclamate, as well as sugar alcohols such as xylitol. NHDC usage boosts the effects of these sweeteners at lower concentrations than would otherwise be required; smaller amounts of other sweeteners are needed. This provides a cost benefit.

== Approval and safety ==

NHDC is approved in the European Union as sweetener (E-959) since 1994, as well as flavouring (FL-16.061). It is also listed as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) flavour enhancer by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association.

In November 2020, the FDA issued a no objection letter to the GRAS status of Neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC). The FDA concluded that NHDC is GRAS (based on scientific procedures) for its intended use as a sweetener in various food categories at maximum levels of 10–1000 ppm.

NHDC is also included both in European Pharmacopoeia and United States Pharmacopeia, for being used as excipient in drug products.

The safety of NHDC has been extensively tested. Safety studies have indicated that NHDC is neither toxic, mutagenic nor carcinogenic. Like other flavonoids, NHDC is easily metabolized by intestinal microbiota to innocuous products.

The safety of NHDC has been thoroughly tested again by the European Food Safety Agency in 2022. The acceptable daily intake was set at 20 mg/kg of body weight.

== Uses ==

In food it is used as a flavour enhancer in concentrations of around 4–5 parts per million (ppm) and as an artificial sweetener at around 15–20 ppm.

=== Masking ===

Pharmaceutical companies are fond of the product as a means of reducing the bitterness of pharmacological drugs in tablet form, and it has been used for livestock feed as a means of reducing feeding time. It is also widely favoured for use in otherwise naturally bitter products.

=== Enhancer ===
As a flavour enhancer, NHDC is used in a wide range of products and is indicated by the E number E 959. It is noted particularly for enhancing sensory effects (known in the industry as &#x27;mouth feel&#x27;). An example of this is &#x27;creaminess&#x27; in dairy foods such as yogurt and ice cream.

=== Other uses ===

Other products NHDC can be found in may include a wide variety of beverages,
alcoholic and non-alcoholic, savoury foods, toothpaste, mouthwash and condiments such as ketchup and mayonnaise. NHDC is also used as excipient in drug products to mask the bitter taste of some active pharmaceutical ingredients.

<doc id="321115" wikidata="Q3090700" url="?curid=321115" title="Mauritius ornate day gecko">
<text>Mauritius ornate day gecko (Phelsuma ornata) is a diurnal species of gecko. It occurs on the island of Mauritius and some surrounding islands and typically inhabits different trees and bushes. The Mauritius ornate day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Description==
This gecko is one of the smallest day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 12 cm. The back of the neck and head are greyish brown and bordered by white neck stripes. The body colour is quite variable. It can be bluish green, green with a blue area on the front back, or completely blue. The flanks are brown. The snout consists of an intricate pattern of cyan, white, red and dark blue. The back is covered with red coloured dots. The tail is turquoise with red transverse bars. The ventral side is off-white.

==Distribution==
This species is found on Mauritius, Round Island, Île aux Aigrettes (Île aux Aigrettes) and Coin de Mire. It is found in the coastal areas.

==Habitat==
&quot;Phelsuma ornata&quot; typically lives in the drier areas of Mauritius at low- and mid-elevation. It can be found on trees, other pantropic vegetation or on rocks where the original vegetation has been cleared.

A resident of Flic en Flac on the west coast of Mauritius reports that their garden has been colonised by these geckos. They can be seen walking all over the garden walls and the walls of the house, and some of them venture indoors, even spending the night behind wardrobes before going outside in the morning via the open windows.

==Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar

==Behaviour==
This &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species can be quite shy in captivity. These day geckos are also surprisingly speedy. 

They seem not to be frightened by people - they stop on the wall, making eye contact, and look and listen to someone talking to them, but they appear not to be vocal, unlike the night geckos.

==Reproduction==
At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 40 days. The juveniles measure around 35 mm.

In 2014, an experiment with five Mauritius ornate day geckos was launched to space in order to test the effect of microgravity on gecko reproduction. The geckos died from a combination of factors due to a loss of communication with the satellite, including a life support malfunction which deactivated the heating system.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs in a well planted enclosure. The temperature should be between during the day and dropped to around at night. The humidity should be maintained between 50 and 60% during the day and 80–90% at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<doc id="321140" wikidata="Q213398" url="?curid=321140" title="History of Bratislava">
<text>[[Bratislava]] (, ), currently the capital of Slovakia and the country&#x27;s largest city, has existed for about a thousand years. Because of the city&#x27;s strategic geographical location, it was an important European hub due to its proximity to the advanced cultures of the Mediterranean and the Orient as well as its link to the rest of Europe, which were possible by the Danube River.

==Prehistory==
In the area where present-day Bratislava lies, three skeletons of the &quot;(Epi)Pliopithecus vindobonensis&quot; were found in the borough Devínska Nová Ves in 1957, dating to 25–15 million years ago. Teeth of the &quot;Griphopithecus suessi&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Sivapithecus darwiny&quot; or &quot;Dryopithecus darwiny&quot;), dating 14–10 million years ago, were also found in Devínska Nová Ves, this time in 1902. From the Paleolithic period, hand-axes and other stone tools of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; (from the periods about 0.45 million years and about 0.3 million years ago) and of Neanderthal man were found.

The first known permanent settlements on the town&#x27;s territory (Linear Ceramics Culture) was during the Neolithic period. However, during the Early Stone Age there was already a settlement in the general area. But this was not within the present territory of the city. The first known fortified settlement on the area of later medieval castle of Bratislava appeared in Eneolithic. In the Bronze Age there were settlements from both older and younger (Urnfield cultures) part of the period. On the area of later Devín castle one finds important clues to the final period of the Bronze Age (Podoli Culture), when a fortified settlement arose on the strategic place: rock-cliff over river Morava joining river Danube.

===Early Iron Age===
The early Iron Age brought a shift of the settlements focus again to the area of today&#x27;s historical centre and the castle of Bratislava. This period is considered an epilogue to Central European pre-history and this is attributed to the migration of the Thracian tribes, which brought with them their version of the Hellenic civilization. Many archaeological finds support the theory that both the castle-hill and the area of the town (on an important river-crossing) formed an important seat of local Hallstatt Culture and that the richly furnished mounds (barrows) excavated on eastern suburbs of the city may have been burial grounds of princes.

====Late Iron Age====
The La Tène period is defined as from 450 BC to 50 BC. Celts (more exactly the tribe of Boii) formed between 125 and 50 BC an important Celtic &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified town) with a mint in the area of the castle hill and the historical centre. There is an acropolis on the castle hill and some settlements below (crafts) and around it (farming). Bratislava then became a genuine town for the first time in history (it will become a de facto town again in the 9th century AD and then again in the 11th century). The most notable finds are represented by silver coins, bearing inscriptions (biatecs in most cases). Biatec may have been the name of the local prince who organized the minting or the name of the place itself. After the bloody defeat at the hands of Dacian forces under the leadership of King Burebista (shortly after the middle of the 1st century BC) the remaining Celts retreated to the site of Devín, creating a smaller, more easily protected hill-fort settlement. The arrival of Germans from the west forced the rest of the Celts to seek protection under the Romans on the other (right) side of Danube.

==1st century–10th century==
From the 1st to 4th centuries the border of the Roman Empire (Limes Romanus) ran along the Danube. The northern side belonged to the Free Barbaricum (German tribes – Marcomanni) and southern side belonged to Rome. Under the suburb of Rusovce, the remains of the Roman border town &quot;Gerulata&quot; have been excavated, as well as cemeteries and farming background of the town (Villa Rusticas). Despite belonging officially to Barbaricum, several sites of Roman presence are to be found on the area of the city. There is, for example, the case of the Devín Castle, which historical records such as the Chronicle of Fulda, alluded to as the impregnable Roman military garrison called Dowina. Traces of Roman presence also include Stupava, a trading station and Dúbravka, which is known for the remains of Roman baths (attempt to build Villa Rustica?).

The Slavs arrived in the area between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period (375–568). Recently, archaeologists found a carbonized loaf of bread at Devin and its age was estimated to be older than the Slavic settlement but still fell within the period of the migration of nations.

In 568 the Eurasian Avars arrived in the area. After a successful insurrection of the Slavs (probably at Bratislava-Devín) against Avarian rule in this region, Samo was made King of the Slavs in 623, establishing the first known Slavic political entity, Samo&#x27;s Empire, which lasted until 658. From the 8th century until 907 the Pressburg fortress as well as the Dowina (Devín) Castle are important centres of the Principality of Nitra.

In 864 the first written reference to the Devín Castle (Dowina) appears in the Fuldish Annals. Around 900 it was probably owned by the (originally) 
Lower Pannonian prince Braslav (Bräslav, Brazlaw) - or by a magnate of the same name - who was a vassal of Bavaria (Germany). Earlier, it was thought that Bräslav was the person who gave the town Bratislava its German name Brezalauspurc (see 907), later Pressburg, and maybe also its new Slovak name Bratislava; nowadays, it is assumed that Pressburg/Brezalauspurc is a distortion of Predeslausburg, a name derived from Predslav, who was (according to some historians) the ruler of Bratislava around 900 and the 3rd son of the Great Moravian king Svätopluk; the modern Slovak name Bratislava, however, is assumed to be derived (by mistake) from the name of the Czech ruler Bretislav I. The first written reference to Bratislava (as Brezalauspurc) appears in 1837 by J. Safarik Slovak historian. The Bavarians were totally defeated by the Magyars; as a result, the Frankish East March dissolved and was occupied by the Magyars (907–955). Pressburg then became part of emerging medieval Hungary.

==1000–1241==
From 1000 to the early 13th century a market settlement (the future town centre) grew below the Pozsony Castle (first written reference in 1151) and became an important centre in the early 13th century. Further settlements in the surrounding areas followed. The Castle became one of the best fortifications in Hungary because of its position, and (along with the city) became a site of frequent attacks and battles, and a place of frequent stay by Hungarian kings. Around 1000 the Pozsony county (comitatus), one of the first counties in Hungary, was founded, probably by Grand Prince Stephen I. Coins with the inscriptions &quot;PHANUS REX&quot; and &quot;RESLAVVA CIV&quot; have been found in Sweden; some scholars claim that the coins were minted in &quot;(p)RESLAVVA CIV(itas)&quot; or &quot;(b)RESLAVVA CIV(itas)&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, in the town of Bratislava), but other authors point out that no coins of this type have been found on the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, their weight and diameter differ from King Stephen&#x27;s other coins and their inscriptions are confused which suggest that they are counterfeit coins minted abroad on the sample of other coins that had been minted following the patterns of King Stephen&#x27;s coins with the inscriptions &quot;STEPHANUS REX&quot; and &quot;REGIA CIVITAS&quot;.

In 1030 the Czech duke Břetislav I, participating in a campaign of the German emperor Konrad II against Hungary, devastated present-day western Slovakia and undertook an attack against the Pozsony castle but was defeated by the Hungarian king. 12 years later Břetislav I and the troops of the German king Henry III temporarily conquered Pozsony. Henry undertook a new invasion in 1043.

In 1052 the German king Henry III besieged Pozsony for 2 months without success, but caused considerable damage to the castle. The following year, Pope Leo IX personally visited the town to achieve a peace between Henry and the Hungarian king. In 1073 and 1074 Hungarian king Solomon, who was based at Pozsony castle during his fighting against Géza and Duke Ladislaus, had the castle reconstructed. Hungarians settled in the market settlement below the castle in several waves in the 12th and 13th centuries, joining the previously predominantly Slovak inhabitants there. In 1108 the German king Henry V, along with the Czech duke Svatopluk, failed to conquer Pozsony/Pressburg castle. In 1109 a new attack of the Czechs (undertaken as a revenge for a Hungarian attack of Moravia) failed. Boris, who claimed the throne against King Géza I of Hungary (although his mother had been removed by her husband, King Coloman of Hungary because of adultery), besieged and conquered Pressburg Castle in 1146. The Hungarian king has to buy it back. The Hungarian king Stephen III was living in Pozsony castle in the 1160s and had its fortification improved. Participants of the Third Crusade to the Holy Land, led by the German king Frederick I Barbarossa, gathered at Pozsony castle in 1189.

==1241–1536==
In 1241 and 1242 the Mongols failed to conquer the fortified castle and the town below it, but temporarily devastated the surrounding settlements. The castle was adapted after these attacks. After 1242, German colonists came to the town and gradually their number increased, so that until the late 19th century they represented by far the largest ethnic group in the town. In 1271 and 1273–1276 the town was captured by the King of Bohemia, Ottakar II in connection with fighting between Hungary and Bohemia because of Styria. In this connection, the (1st) Peace of Pressburg was signed in 1271.

The city was captured by the Hungarian nobleman and palatine Nicholas Kőszegi in 1285–1286, who (temporarily) burned down the castle in 1286, but his revolt against the king was defeated. In 1287–1291 the city was captured by the Austrian duke Albert of Habsburg. Albert was defeated by the Hungarian nobleman Matthew III Csák of Trenčín, who was the leader of Pozsony and Trenčín counties at that time and Pozsony belonged to Hungary again.

The town (the part below the castle) was conferred its first (known) town privileges by the Hungarian king Andrew III in 1291. Earlier town privileges are not known, but probable, because Pressburg has been called a &quot;town&quot; as early as around 1250. After 1291, the town received many privileges from Hungarian kings, especially from the emperor Sigismund in the 15th century. After the death of the Hungarian king Andrew III, Pressburg was annexed by Austria in 1301, because Andrew&#x27;s widow gave the town to the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs returned it to Hungary in 1322, but occupied it again later. It is only in 1338 that the town finally became part of Hungary again. In 1405 the town was declared a free royal town by King Sigismund of Luxemburg. Not only Pressburg but all towns in Hungary got this status (meaning that they received &quot;collective nobility&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; the status of a feudal lord with all its privileges) because Sigismund wanted to restrain the increasing power of the (true) feudal lords in Hungary. The Hussites first appeared in 1428, when they burned down the suburbs of Pressburg. Negotiations held a year later in Pressburg between Sigismund of Luxemburg and the Hussites (in April and in June) failed. Between 1432 and 1434 the Hussites tried to conquer the city but their attacks failed. The first bridge over the Danube in Pressburg was built in 1434, but it was destroyed by floods next year. In 1434 and 1435 the amount of paymentsby Hungary, for which the Hussites would leave Slovakia, was officially negotiated. In 1436 Sigismund of Luxemburg awarded Pressburg the right to use its own coat of arms and orders to improve the fortification of the castle (because of the last Hussite invasion during that year). From 1439 to 1486 another bridge over the Danube existed in Pozsony, being washed away by flood in 1486.

Between 1440 and 1443 there was fighting between the castle of Pozsony, supporting king Ladislaus III of Poland, and the actual town of Pozsony below the castle hill, supporting (and owned by) queen Elisabeth. In 1442 Ladislaus settled at the castle and temporarily conquered the town, but was defeated by the Austrian emperor Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor supporting Elisabeth. Finally, in 1443 Elisabeth got the town back, but the castle remained in Ladislaus&#x27; hands till his death in 1444.

From 1465 until 1490 Pozsony was the seat of the first university in present-day Slovakia, the Universitas Istropolitana (often wrongly called Academia Istropolitana). From 1490 to 1526 Pressburg was a place of diplomatic negotiations under the Jagiellonian kings. In the summer of 1490 Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor drove the Hungarians from Austria, and even occupies Hungarian frontier territories, but he is compelled by want of money to retreat, and signed the Treaty of Pressburg (also called the (2nd) Peace of Pressburg) with the Hungarian King Ladislaus II on 7 November 1491. Under this treaty it is agreed that Hungary renounced Lower Austria and agreed that Maximilian should succeed to the crown in case Ladislaus left no legitimate male issue.

After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, where the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the expanding Ottoman Empire, the Turks besieged Pressburg 1529, but failed to conquer it. Two years later churches and hospitals outside the town wall were deliberately destroyed so that the Turks would not be able to see from there into the town behind the town wall. In the beginning of 1532 thousands of soldiers were sent to Pressburg as a protection against the Turks planning to attack Vienna. Pressburg was temporarily turned to a military camp. The Turks, seeing the military force in Pressburg, decide to attack Vienna from the south. In this period the city became a safe haven for the Holy Crown of Hungary, kept safe from Turkish and Habsburg hands.

==1536–1784==

As a consequence of Ottoman advances through Hungarian territory and the capture of Buda, the city of Pressburg was designated as the capital of Royal Hungary in 1536. The Kingdom of Hungary was part of the Habsburg Monarchy from 1526 to 1918. Pressburg was also made a meeting place of the Hungarian Diet from 1542 to 1848 (with interruptions) and the coronation town for Hungarian kings and queens from 1536 to 1830 (in the St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral). The first coronation was that of King Maximilian of Habsburg, the last one the coronation of Ferdinand V. Altogether, 11 kings and 8 queens were crowned in the town. During Maria Theresa&#x27;s 40-year reign, Bratislava - along with the rest of her empire - enjoyed sustained economic and social growth.

However, in the 17th century, the town was affected by anti-Habsburg uprisings. In addition, there was fighting with the Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters. The Evangelic Lutheran Lyceum (Evanjelické lýceum) (a kind of Protestant grammar school and, in the 19th century, also a kind of university) was founded in 1607.

===Anti-Habsburg uprisings===
In 1606 (during the Stephen Bocskay Uprising), Bocskay troops occupied the surroundings of Pressburg. Gabriel Bethlen conquered Pressburg in 1619, as a part of the Bethlen uprising. He was defeated by imperial troops in 1621, and then besieged the town from 1621 to 1622. The (3rd) Peace of Pressburg between Gabriel Bethlen and the emperor Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor was signed in 1626, which put an end to the Bethlen anti-Habsburg uprising. From 1671 to 1677 Pressburg was seat of extraordinary courts against the Protestants and participants in the anti-Habsburg uprisings; &quot;e.g.&quot; a trial against the participants of the Wesselényi conspiracy takes place in 1671. In the Imre Thököly Uprising (1682–1683) Pozsony was the only town in present-day Slovakia that refused to capitulate to Thököly&#x27;s troops. Finall, the town, but not the castle, capitulated in July 1683 and was only reconquered by Imperial troops after the Turks were defeated near Vienna (September 1683). The last of the uprisings that affected the town was in 1704 (within the Rákóczi Uprising), when Prince Eugene of Savoy managed to protect Pressburg from Rákóczi&#x27;s troops, although the surroundings of the town wer totally destroyed.

==18th century==
Since the 18th century the city has been an important centre of the Slovak national and cultural movement (Slovak National Revival). The Great Plague Epidemic killed 3800 people in the years 1710 and 1711. Later the Holy Trinity column was erected in thanksgiving to God for its ending. In the 18th century, many new baroque buildings were erected, the economy flourished (first factory in 1728), and the first parks were established (see today&#x27;s Hviezdoslavovo námestie). The town wall was demolished in 1775 to enable further expansion, the first city theatre was opened in 1776, and Pressburg became the largest and most important town in the territory of present-day Slovakia and Hungary. The first journal in Hungary, &quot;Mercurius Veridicus ex Hungaria&quot;, was published here in 1705 and the first regular newspaper in Hungary (written in Latin), &quot;Nova Posoniensia&quot;, was published in 1721–1722.
The Pragmatic Sanction law was enacted in 1713, which decided the Habsburg monarch&#x27;s unity and that woman can inherit the Hungarian throne. Maria Theresa of Austria is crowned Queen Regnant of Hungary at St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral on 25 June 1741. The 6-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave a concert in the Pálffy Palace in 1762. In 1764 the first German newspaper in Hungary, the &quot;Pressburger Zeitung&quot;, began publication (which ceased in 1929), and on 1 January 1780.the first newspaper in Hungarian, &quot;Magyar hírmondó&quot; was published here.

The population increased by 200% between 1720 and 1780, and by 1782 the population had reached 33,000 (out of which 29,223 were in the part of the town below the castle that had the free royal town status), thus making Pressburg the largest town in Hungary. In 1783, the first newspaper in Slovak, &quot;Presspurske Nowiny&quot; (which remained in circulation until 1787) was published and the first novel in Slovak, &quot;Rene mladenca prihody a skusenosti&quot; (&quot;The Adventures and Experiences of the Youth Rene&quot;) by Jozef Ignác Bajza, was published.

In 1775, Coronation Hill was built by Maria Theresa from soil of Hungary&#x27;s 64 counties. The new monarch had to ride to the crowning hill and swish their blade towards the four cardinal points.
However, in 1783, under the reign of Joseph II, the Crown Jewels were taken to Vienna, and many central offices moved to Buda, which were followed by a big part of the nobility. From here on Pressburg was only the coronation town and the seat of the Hungarian diet. The population decreased and the economic situation of the town deteriorated until 1811.

==1784–1900==
From 1784 to 1800, the General Seminary (a school for Catholic clergy) was based in Pressburg Castle. One of the notable students at this time was Anton Bernolák, who published in 1787 the first Slovak language standard. Another educational institution in Pressburg was the Royal Academy, which moved to the city from Trnava in 1787. In 1803, a separate Department of Czechoslovak Speech and Literature was created (from the Institute of Czechoslovak Speech and Literature founded in 1801) at the Lutheran Lyceum.

Pressburg also played a role in early 19th-century European politics. In 1805, the fourth and best-known Treaty of Pressburg was signed by Austria and France after Napoleon I&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. Four years later, Napoleon&#x27;s army besieged and bombarded the city and Napoleon himself visited Pressburg. Dévény Castle was turned into a ruin by the French troops in 1809 and Pressburg Castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire in 1811 (remaining in ruins until the 1950s).

In 1820, the 9-year-old Franz Liszt played in De Pauli&#x27;s Palace. Five years later, István Széchenyi offered his yearly income to establish the Hungarian National Learned Society (now the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) in Pozsony. In 1829, the Czech-Slav Society (also called the Society for the Czechoslovak Language and Literature) was created by students of the Lutheran Lyceum, which later became an important organization in the Slovak national movement. Ľudovít Štúr also began studying at the Lyceum during this period, spending 20 years there. In 1843 he codified the present-day Slovak language standard. The industrialisation of the town began with regular steamship transport on the Danube in 1830. Ten years later the first (horse-)railway line in Hungary and present-day Slovakia was built from Pressburg to the town of Svätý Jur, north of Bratislava. Later, it extended to Trnava and Sereď (1846).

Lajos Kossuth appointed Artúr Görgey the commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army in Pressburg. But the Hungarian army lost the Battle of Schwechat and Prince of Windischgraetz&#x27;s Austrian army entered the city without fighting on 18 December 1848. After the 1848 Revolution was defeated, the tribunal organized by Field Marshal Julius Jacob von Haynau sentenced 149 people to prison and 14 people to death.

* Late 19th century: New prosperity was arose, partly thanks to mayor Henrik Justi and banker Theodor Edl (who, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, had been political opponents). This period witnessed considerable modernization of infrastructure in Pressburg, including new sewerage and gas-works in 1856, the beginnings of a telephone and electrical lighting system in 1884, a new water supply system, the first permanent bridge over the Danube in 1891 (Starý most), the development of a tram system in 1895, and the introduction of public electricity in 1902. The city also industrialized, with the foundation of a chemical factory known today as Istrochem in 1873 and an oil refinery known today as Slovnaft in 1895.

==20th century==
In 1905 Philipp Lenard, the Hungarian-German physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics for his research on cathode rays and the discovery of many of their properties, visited Pressburg. In the same year, Ján Bahýľ, a Slovak inventor, flew his petrol-engine helicopter in Pressburg, reaching a height of 4 metres for more than . A

After World War I, began dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. U.S. president Woodrow Wilson and the United States played a major role in the establishment of the new Czechoslovak state. In a blatant attempt to appeal to the Allies, American Slovaks proposed rename the city “Wilsonovo mesto” (Wilson City), after Woodrow Wilson. 

On 28 October 1918, Czechoslovakia was proclaimed, but its borders were not settled for several months. The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city, while the Hungarian Prime Minister Károlyi protested against the &quot;Czech invasion&quot;. This Hungarian narrative was debunked by the Slovak National Assembly in 15 November, who pointed out the presence of Slovak soldiers and officers among the legionaries and declared their presence as the &quot;defensive action of the Slovaks themselves, to end the anarchy caused by the flight of the Hungarians.&quot; The Entente drew a provisional demarcation line, this was revealed to the Hungarian government on December 23, in the document known as the Vix Note. The 33rd regiment arrived from Italy and began to advance on 30 December. The minister for the administration of Slovakia, V. Šrobár, requested to negotiate a peaceful surrender of Bratislava to the Czecho-Slovak troops, through sheriff S. Zoch. Afterwards, General Piccione ordered the legionaries to enter Bratislava on 1 January 1919, and by 2 January all important civil and military buildings were in Czechoslovak hands. The city became the seat of Slovakia&#x27;s political organs and organizations and became Slovakia&#x27;s capital on 4 February. The (Hungarian) Elisabeth University was originally based here, before becoming the Slovak Comenius University after the Czechoslovakian state requisitioned it on 6 January.

On 12 February 1919, According to Hungarian politician Marcell Jankovics, the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators. Slovak sources do not deny the shooting, but add that the Legionaries were defending themselves from violent and aggressive behavior of the demonstrators. A contemporary Slovak language newspaper reported that &quot;a mob spat on our soldiers, tore down badges from their hats, physically attacked them and shot on them from windows.&quot; According to Hungarian historian Attila Simon, the intervention by the Czechoslovak soldiers firing on the peaceful demonstrators caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, while Slovak historian Marián Hronský mentions 6 dead and several injured, including the Czechoslovak military commander who was left wounded by Hungarian demonstrators.

On 27 March, the town&#x27;s official new name became &quot;Bratislava&quot; – instead of &quot;Prešporok&quot; (Slovak) / &quot;Pressburg&quot; (German) / &quot;Pozsony&quot; (Hungarian).

On 4 May Milan Rastislav Štefánik, the French–Slovak general, died in an airplane crash near Bratislava (/Pressburg). On 26–27 October 1921, the statue of Maria Theresa, the Austrian Empress, was destroyed by Slovakian nationalists and the members of the Sokol Movement.

Between 1928 and 1930 the Hotel Carlton was built in the place of Hotel Zöldfa, on Séta square (now Hviezdoslavovo square). Hotel Zöldfa had included Lajos Kossuth, Franz Joseph I, Alfred Nobel, and Albert Einstein amongst its guests. The 1930 census showed that the Hungarian population had decreased to under 20% of the city, and Hungarian language signs were removed. Between 1938 (October) – 1939 (March), Bratislava became the seat of government of the autonomous Slovakia within Czechoslovakia (see &quot;e.g.&quot; Jozef Tiso). Between 1938 (November) – 1945, the future Petržalka borough was occupied by Nazi Germany, and from October 1938 to April 1945, the future Devín borough was part of the Lower Austria area of the German Third Reich. After the break-up of Czechoslovakia, Bratislava became the capital of the First Slovak Republic in 1939. By 1945, most of the city&#x27;s approximately 15,000 Jews had been removed and sent to concentration camps. The Bratislava oil district, including the Apollo oil refinery, was bombed on 9 September 1944 during the German occupation. The Soviet Red Army took Bratislava on 4 April 1945.

=== After World War II ===
After the war, most of the German population were expelled (some Germans had already been evacuated by German authorities). In 1946, Jews living in the city were attacked during the Partisan Congress riots.

In 1946, the city incorporated the neighbouring villages of Devín, Dúbravka, Lamač, Petržalka, Prievoz (now part of Ružinov), Rača, and Vajnory (Karlova Ves had been annexed in 1944). The so-called Bratislava bridgehead on the right bank of the Danube was enlarged in 1947 with the hitherto Hungarian villages of Jarovce, Rusovce and Čunovo, in accord with the Paris Peace Conference, which transferred these villages to Czechoslovakia, on the grounds that Bratislava needed space for growth. After the Communists seized power in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc. Several present-day cultural institutions were established (first films made in the town in 1948; Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra founded in 1949; Slovak National Gallery in 1951, Slovak Academy of Sciences in 1953, Bratislava Gallery in 1959, Slovak Television in 1956), several factories and landmarks were built (sometimes at the expense of the historical cityscape) – Slavín in 1960, Kamzík TV Tower in the 1970s, reconstruction of the Bratislava Castle in 1953–62, and Nový Most, the second bridge over the Danube, in 1972; and factories (&quot;Bratislavské automobilové závody&quot; and Slovnaft). The city was also affected by the unsuccessful Czechoslovak attempt to liberalize the Communist regime in 1968. Shortly after that, the city became capital of the Slovak Socialist Republic, a part of federalized Czechoslovakia, after the signing of the Law of Federation at the Bratislava Castle in 1968. Since the 1960s, construction of the huge prefab panel buildings had been ongoing. The city also expanded once more in 1972, annexing villages of Jarovce, Rusovce, Čunovo, Devínska Nová Ves, Záhorská Bystrica, Vrakuňa and Podunajské Biskupice. The third bridge over the Danube, called Prístavný most (Harbour Bridge) was built in 1985. The fall of the Communist regime was anticipated by the candle demonstration in 1988, which was violently scattered by the police.

=== After the fall of Communism ===
In November 1989 the city became one of the centres of the Velvet Revolution; Alexander Dubček held his first speech in the city since 1970, and (one day before demonstrations in Prague), Slovak students rallied against the Communist regime on 16 November 1989; further demonstrations would follow. The first non-Communist political party, &quot;Public Against Violence&quot; (Verejnosť proti násiliu, VPN) was established on 21 November.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bratislava was plagued by a rise in criminality. From 6 October 1990 to 16 July 1991 Bratislava had two active serial killers – Ondrej Rigo and Jozef Slovák.

In 1991 the factory of the automaker Volkswagen was founded in Bratislava (until 1994 as a joint venture with the &quot;Bratislavské automobilové závody&quot;); the fourth bridge over the Danube, Most Lafranconi, was built. On 17 July 1992 the Declaration of Independence of the Slovak Nation was adopted by the Slovak National Council (called National Council of the Slovak Republic since 1994). Six days later the prime ministers of the two constituent republics of Czechoslovakia agree to split the country into two independent states; the Constitution of Slovakia was adopted 1 September and signed at Bratislava Castle 3 September. After the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992 the city was declared the capital of independent Slovakia.

<text>Adalbert Stifter (; 23 October 1805 – 28 January 1868) was a Bohemian-Austrian writer, poet, painter, and pedagogue. He was notable for the vivid natural landscapes depicted in his writing and has long been popular in the German-speaking world.

==Life==
Born in Oberplan in Bohemia (now Horní Planá in the Czech Republic), he was the eldest son of Johann Stifter, a wealthy linen weaver, and his wife, Magdalena. Johann died in 1817 after being crushed by an overturned wagon. Stifter was educated at the &quot; Benedictine Gymnasium&quot; at Kremsmünster, and went to the University of Vienna in 1826 to study law. In 1828 he fell in love with Fanny Greipl, but after a relationship lasting five years, her parents forbade further correspondence, a loss from which he never recovered.
In 1835 he became engaged to Amalia Mohaupt, and they married in 1837, but the marriage was not a happy one. Stifter and his wife, unable to conceive, tried adopting three of Amalia&#x27;s nieces at different times. One of them, Juliana, ran away several times and finally disappeared, only to be found drowned in the Danube four weeks later.

As a man of strong liberal convictions who welcomed the 1848 revolutions and allowed his name to go forward as a candidate in the Frankfurt Parliament, even suspected by others of being a radical, the cornerstone of Stifter&#x27;s philosophy was Bildung (personal and cultural maturation through education). Instead of becoming a state official, he became a tutor to the aristocrats of Vienna, and was highly regarded as such. His students included Princess Maria Anna von Schwarzenberg and the son of German statesman Klemens von Metternich, Richard von Metternich. He also made some money from selling paintings, and published his first story, &quot;Der Condor&quot;, in 1840. An immediate success, it inaugurated a steady writing career.

Stifter visited Linz in 1848, and moved there permanently a year later, where he became editor of the &quot;Linzer Zeitung&quot; and the &quot;Wiener Bote&quot;. In 1850 he was appointed supervisor of elementary schools for Upper Austria.

His physical and mental health began to decline in 1863, and he became seriously ill from cirrhosis of the liver in 1867. In deep depression, he slashed his neck with a razor on the night of 25 January 1868 and died three days later.

==Work==

Stifter&#x27;s work is characterized by the pursuit of beauty; his characters strive to be moral and move in gorgeous landscapes luxuriously described. Evil, cruelty, and suffering rarely appear on the surface of his writing, but Thomas Mann noted that &quot;behind the quiet, inward exactitude of his descriptions of Nature in particular there is at work a predilection for the excessive, the elemental and the catastrophic, the pathological.&quot; Although considered by some to be one-dimensional compared to his more famous and realistic contemporaries, his visions of ideal worlds reflect his informal allegiance to the Biedermeier movement in literature. As Carl Schorske puts it, &quot;To illustrate and propagate his concept of Bildung, compounded of Benedictine world piety, German humanism, and Biedermeier conventionality, Stifter gave to the world his novel &quot;Der Nachsommer&quot;&quot;.

The majority of his works are long stories or short novels, many of which were published in multiple versions, sometimes radically changed. His major works are the long novels &quot;Der Nachsommer&quot; and &quot;Witiko&quot;.

Stifter&#x27;s &quot;Der Nachsommer&quot; (1857) and Gottfried Keller&#x27;s &quot;Seldwyla Folks&quot; () were named the two great German novels of the 19th century by Friedrich Nietzsche. &quot;Der Nachsommer&quot; is considered one of the finest examples of the Bildungsroman, but received a mixed reception from critics at the time. Friedrich Hebbel offered the crown of Poland to whoever could finish it, and called Stifter a writer only interested in &quot;beetles and buttercups&quot;. The excessive detail for which Hebbel derided the novel, is, according to Christine Oertel Sjögren, &quot;precisely a source of fascination for modern scholars, who seize upon the number of objects as the distinguishing characteristic of this novel and accord it high esteem because of the very significance of the &#x27;things&#x27; in it. Far from being extraneous elements, as Hebbel regarded them, the art and nature objects provide a rich setting of beauty and a mirror-background to the human story in the foreground.&quot; [3]:20

&quot;Witiko&quot; is a historical novel set in the 12th century, a strange work panned by many critics, but praised by Hermann Hesse and Thomas Mann postingx Dietrich Bonhoeffer found great comfort from his reading of &quot;Witiko&quot; while in Tegel Prison under Nazi arrest.

==Influence==

In the German edition of his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, Carl Schurz recalls his meeting with the daughter of the keeper of the Swiss inn he was staying at whose favorite book was Stifter&#x27;s &quot;Studien&quot;. This incident occurred prior to 1852.

He was named as an influence by W. G. Sebald, and both W. H. Auden and Marianne Moore admired his work, the latter co-translating &quot;Bergkristall&quot; as &quot;Rock Crystal&quot; with Elizabeth Mayer in 1945. Auden included Stifter in his poem &quot;Academic Graffiti&quot; as one of the celebrities, literary and otherwise, captured in a clerihew: Adalbert Stifter / Was no weight-lifter: / He would hire old lags / To carry his bags.

In Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Steppenwolf&quot;, the main character Harry Haller wonders &quot;whether it isn&#x27;t time to follow the example of Adalbert Stifter and have an accident while shaving&quot;.

Thomas Mann was also an admirer of Stifter, calling him &quot;one of the most extraordinary, the most enigmatic, the most secretly daring and the most strangely gripping narrators in world literature.&quot;

In the satirical novel &quot;Old Masters&quot; by Thomas Bernhard, the main character Reger gives a vitriolic rant disparaging Stifter&#x27;s fiction. 

Rilke and Hugo von Hofmannsthal were deeply indebted to his art.

==Recent production==
In 2007 German theater director Heiner Goebbels, inspired by works of Adalbert Stifter, composed and directed a musical installation called &quot;Stifters Dinge&quot; (&quot;Stifter&#x27;s Things&quot;), which premiered in 2007 at the Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne, in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<text>Sir Francis Beaufort ( ; 27 May 1774 – 17 December 1857) was an Irish hydrographer, the creator of the Beaufort cipher and the Beaufort scale, and a naval officer.

== Early life ==

Francis Beaufort was descended from French Protestant Huguenots, who fled the French Wars of Religion in the sixteenth century. His parents moved to Ireland from London. His father, Daniel Augustus Beaufort, was a Protestant clergyman from Navan, County Meath, Ireland, and a member of the learned Royal Irish Academy. His mother Mary was the daughter and co-heiress of William Waller, of Allenstown House. Francis was born in Navan on 27 May 1774. He had an older brother, William Louis Beaufort and three sisters, Frances, Harriet, and Louisa. His father created and published a new map of Ireland in 1792. Francis grew up in Wales and Ireland until age fourteen. He left school and went to sea, but never stopped his education. By later in life, he had become sufficiently self-educated to associate with some of the greatest scientists and applied mathematicians of his time, including Mary Somerville, John Herschel, George Biddell Airy, and Charles Babbage.

Francis Beaufort had a lifelong keen awareness of the value of accurate charts for those risking the seas, as he was shipwrecked at the age of fifteen due to a faulty chart. His most significant accomplishments were in nautical charting.

== Career ==

=== Early naval career ===
Beaufort first went to sea in 1789 on the British East India Company East Indiaman . She was wrecked, but all but one man of her crew survived and Beaufort returned home.

Beaufort commenced his naval career in 1790 by joining as a midshipman. She was paid off late in the year and Beaufort transferred in 1791 to the fifth rate frigate . After the commencement of war with France he was on &quot;Aquilon&quot; during the Battle of the Glorious First of June off Ushant in Brittany in 1794, when &quot;Aquilon&quot; rescued the dismasted and exchanged broadsides with the French ship-of-the line, .

He was promoted to Lieutenant on 10 May 1796 on . While serving on &quot;Phaeton&quot;, Beaufort was badly wounded leading a cutting-out operation off Málaga in 1800; the action resulted in the capture of the 14-gun polacca . Beaufort was promoted to the rank of Commander on 13 November 1800.

While recovering from his wounds, during which he received a &quot;paltry&quot; pension of £45 per annum, he helped his brother-in-law, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, to construct a semaphore line from Dublin to Galway. He spent two years at this activity, for which he would accept no remuneration.

=== Command ===

Beaufort returned to active service and was appointed a captain in the Royal Navy on 30 May 1810. Whereas other wartime officers sought leisurely pursuits, Beaufort spent his leisure time taking depth soundings and bearings, making astronomical observations to determine longitude and latitude, and measuring shorelines. His results were compiled in new charts.

The Admiralty gave Beaufort his first ship command, . He sailed her to the East Indies and escorted a convoy of East Indiamen back to Britain. The Admiralty then tasked him with conducting a hydrographic survey of the Rio de la Plata estuary in South America. Experts were very impressed by the survey Beaufort brought back. Notably, Alexander Dalrymple remarked in a note to the Admiralty in March 1808, that &quot;we have few officers (indeed I do not know one) in our Service who have half his professional knowledge and ability, and in zeal and perseverance he cannot be excelled.&quot;

=== Anatolia ===

After the &quot;Woolwich&quot;, Beaufort received his first post-captain commission, commanding &quot;Frederickstein&quot;.

Throughout 1811–1812, Beaufort charted and explored southern Anatolia, a region he referred to as Karamania, locating many classical ruins, including Hadrian&#x27;s Gate. An attack on the crew of his boat (at Ayas, near Adana), by Turks interrupted his work and he received a serious bullet wound in the hip. He returned to England and drew up his charts.

In 1817, he published his book &quot;Karamania; or a brief description of the South Coast of Asia Minor, and of the Remains of Antiquity&quot;.

=== Hydrographer of the Navy ===

In 1829, Beaufort was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in the same year, at the age of 55 (retirement age for most administrative contemporaries), Beaufort was appointed as the British Admiralty Hydrographer of the Navy. He served in that post for 26 years, longer than any other Hydrographer. G.S. Ritchie, himself Hydrographer (1966–1971) described this period as the &quot;High Noon&quot; of Admiralty surveying. The geographical scope of surveying was greatly increased, both in home waters and overseas. The production of new charts increased from 19 in 1830 to 1230 in 1855.

In 1831, a Scientific Branch of the Admiralty was formed, which as well as the Hydrographic Department included the great astronomical observatories at Greenwich, England, and the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, and the Nautical Almanac and Chronometer Offices, and Beaufort was responsible for the administration. Beaufort directed some of the major maritime explorations and experiments of that period. He played a leading role in the search for the explorer, Sir John Franklin, who was lost during his last polar voyage to search for the legendary Northwest Passage.

Beaufort was interested in scientific affairs beyond the confines of navigation. As a council member of the Royal Society, the Royal Observatory, and the Royal Geographical Society (which he helped found), Beaufort used his position and prestige as a top administrator to act as a &quot;middleman&quot; for many scientists of his time. Beaufort represented the geographers, astronomers, oceanographers, geodesists, and meteorologists to that government agency, the Hydrographic Office, which could support their research. In 1849 he assisted in the publication of the Admiralty &quot;Manual of Scientific Enquiry&quot;, to assist both Navy personnel and general travellers in scientific investigations, ranging from astronomy to ethnography.

Beaufort trained Robert FitzRoy, who was put in temporary command of the survey ship HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; after her previous captain committed suicide. When FitzRoy was reappointed as commander for what became the famous second voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot;, he requested of Beaufort &quot;that a well-educated and scientific gentleman be sought&quot; as a companion on the voyage. Beaufort&#x27;s enquiries led to an invitation to Charles Darwin, who later drew on his discoveries in formulating the theory of evolution he presented in his book &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Later, when Beaufort persuaded the Board of Trade to set up a Meterorological Department, Fitzroy became its first director

Using his many connections, including the Royal Society, Beaufort helped to obtain funding for the Antarctic voyage of 1839–1843 by James Clark Ross for extensive measurements of terrestrial magnetism, coordinated with similar measurements in Europe and Asia. (This is comparable to the International Geophysical Year of our time.)

Beaufort promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, publishing the first edition of the Admiralty Tide Tables in 1833. This inspired similar research for Europe and North America. Aiding his friend William Whewell, Beaufort gained the support of the Prime Minister, Duke of Wellington, in expanding record-keeping at 200 British Coastguard stations. Beaufort gave enthusiastic support to his friend, Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal and noted mathematician, in achieving a historic period of measurements by the Greenwich and Good Hope observatories.

By the time Beaufort retired the Admiralty Chart series was a truly worldwide resource with 2,000 charts covering every sea.

=== Retirement ===

Beaufort retired from the Royal Navy with the rank of rear admiral on 1 October 1846, at the age of 72. He became &quot;Sir Francis Beaufort&quot; on being appointed KCB (Knight Commander of the Bath) on 29 April 1848, a relatively belated honorific considering the eminence of his position from 1829 onward. In 1840, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

== Personal life ==

Beaufort&#x27;s extant correspondence of more than 200 letters and journals contained portions written in personal cipher. Beaufort altered the Vigenère cipher, by reversing the cipher alphabet, and the resulting variant is called the Beaufort cipher. The deciphered writings have revealed family and personal problems, including some of a sexual nature. It appears that between 1835 and his marriage to Honora Edgeworth in November 1838, he had incestuous relations with his sister Harriet. His diary entries, in cipher, show that he was tortured by guilt over this.

He died on 17 December 1857, at age 83 in Hove, Sussex, England. He is buried in the church gardens of St John at Hackney, London, where his tomb may still be seen. His home in London, No. 52 Manchester Street, Westminster, is marked by an historic blue plaque noting his residency and achievements.

== Family ==

Beaufort married, firstly, Alicia Magdalena Wilson, daughter of Lestock Wilson R.N. under whom he had first served; she died in 1834. Of their children, three daughters and three sons were living in 1859. They included:

* Daniel Augustus Beaufort (1813/4–1898), cleric, married in 1851 Emily Nowell Davis, daughter of Sir John Francis Davis, 1st Baronet.
* Francis Lestock Beaufort (1815–1879), served in the Bengal civil service, from 1837 to 1876.
* Sophia Mary Bonne married the Rev. William Palmer in 1838.
* Emily Anne Smythe (1826–1887) was a hero of Bulgaria, a writer, illustrator and advocate of change in the training of nurses.

Beaufort married again in 1838, to Honora Edgeworth, the daughter of his brother-in-law Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his second wife. (Francis&#x27; sister Frances Beaufort had married Edgeworth as his fourth wife years earlier in the 1810s.)

== Legacy ==

=== Wind force scale ===

During these early years of command, Beaufort developed the first versions of his Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding, which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life. From the circle representing a weather station, a staff (rather like the stem of a note in musical notation) extends, with one or more half or whole barbs. For example, a stave with 3 barbs represents Beaufort seven on the scale, decoded as 32–38 mph, or a &quot;moderate Gale&quot;.

=== Geographical legacy ===

Beaufort, like other patrons of exploration, has had his name given to many geographical places. Among these:

*Beaufort Sea (arm of Arctic Ocean)
*Beaufort&#x27;s Dyke, North Channel
*Beaufort Island, Antarctic
*Beaufort an Australian town.

=== Cryptographic legacy ===

Beaufort created the Beaufort cipher. It is a substitution cipher similar to the Vigenère cipher.

<text>In computer science, model checking or property checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification (also known as correctness). This is typically associated with hardware or software systems, where the specification contains liveness requirements (such as avoidance of livelock) as well as safety requirements (such as avoidance of states representing a system crash).

In order to solve such a problem algorithmically, both the model of the system and its specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language. To this end, the problem is formulated as a task in logic, namely to check whether a structure satisfies a given logical formula. This general concept applies to many kinds of logic and many kinds of structures. A simple model-checking problem consists of verifying whether a formula in the propositional logic is satisfied by a given structure.

== Overview ==
Property checking is used for verification when two descriptions are not equivalent. During refinement, the specification is complemented with details that are unnecessary in the higher-level specification. There is no need to verify the newly introduced properties against the original specification since this is not possible. Therefore, the strict bi-directional equivalence check is relaxed to a one-way property check. The implementation or design is regarded as a model of the system, whereas the specifications are properties that the model must satisfy.

An important class of model-checking methods has been developed for checking models of hardware and software designs where the specification is given by a temporal logic formula. Pioneering work in temporal logic specification was done by Amir Pnueli, who received the 1996 Turing award for &quot;seminal work introducing temporal logic into computing science&quot;. Model checking began with the pioneering work of E. M. Clarke, E. A. Emerson, by J. P. Queille, and J. Sifakis. Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis shared the 2007 Turing Award for their seminal work founding and developing the field of model checking.

Model checking is most often applied to hardware designs. For software, because of undecidability (see computability theory) the approach cannot be fully algorithmic, apply to all systems, and always give an answer; in the general case, it may fail to prove or disprove a given property. In embedded-systems hardware, it is possible to validate a specification delivered, e.g., by means of UML activity diagrams or control-interpreted Petri nets.

The structure is usually given as a source code description in an industrial hardware description language or a special-purpose language. Such a program corresponds to a finite-state machine (FSM), i.e., a directed graph consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges. A set of atomic propositions is associated with each node, typically stating which memory elements are one. The nodes represent states of a system, the edges represent possible transitions that may alter the state, while the atomic propositions represent the basic properties that hold at a point of execution.

Formally, the problem can be stated as follows: given a desired property, expressed as a temporal logic formula formula_1, and a structure formula_2 with initial state formula_3, decide if formula_4. If formula_2 is finite, as it is in hardware, model checking reduces to a graph search.

== Symbolic model checking ==

Instead of enumerating reachable states one at a time, the state space can sometimes be traversed more efficiently by considering large numbers of states at a single step. When such state-space traversal is based on representations of a set of states and transition relations as logical formulas, binary decision diagrams (BDD) or other related data structures, the model-checking method is &quot;symbolic&quot;.

Historically, the first symbolic methods used BDDs. After the success of propositional satisfiability in solving the planning problem in artificial intelligence (see satplan) in 1996, the same approach was generalized to model checking for linear temporal logic (LTL): the planning problem corresponds to model checking for safety properties. This method is known as bounded model checking. The success of Boolean satisfiability solvers in bounded model checking led to the widespread use of satisfiability solvers in symbolic model checking.

===Example===
One example of such a system requirement: 
&quot;Between the time an elevator is called at a floor and the time it opens its doors at that floor, the elevator can arrive at that floor at most twice&quot;. The authors of &quot;Patterns in Property Specification for Finite-State Verification&quot; translate this requirement into the following LTL formula:
:formula_6

Here, formula_7 should be read as &quot;always&quot;, formula_8 as &quot;eventually&quot;, formula_9 as &quot;until&quot; and the other symbols are standard logical symbols, formula_10 for &quot;or&quot;, formula_11 for &quot;and&quot; and formula_12 for &quot;not&quot;.

== Techniques ==
Model-checking tools face a combinatorial blow up of the state-space, commonly known as the state explosion problem, that must be addressed to solve most real-world problems. There are several approaches to combat this problem.

# Symbolic algorithms avoid ever explicitly constructing the graph for the FSM; instead, they represent the graph implicitly using a formula in quantified propositional logic. The use of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) was made popular by the work of Ken McMillan, as well as of Olivier Coudert and Jean-Christophe Madre, and the development of open-source BDD manipulation libraries such as CUDD and BuDDy.
# Bounded model-checking algorithms unroll the FSM for a fixed number of steps, formula_13, and check whether a property violation can occur in formula_13 or fewer steps. This typically involves encoding the restricted model as an instance of SAT. The process can be repeated with larger and larger values of formula_13 until all possible violations have been ruled out (cf. Iterative deepening depth-first search).
# Abstraction attempts to prove properties of a system by first simplifying it. The simplified system usually does not satisfy exactly the same properties as the original one so that a process of refinement may be necessary. Generally, one requires the abstraction to be &quot;sound&quot; (the properties proved on the abstraction are true of the original system); however, sometimes the abstraction is not &quot;complete&quot; (not all true properties of the original system are true of the abstraction). An example of abstraction is to ignore the values of non-Boolean variables and to only consider Boolean variables and the control flow of the program; such an abstraction, though it may appear coarse, may, in fact, be sufficient to prove e.g. properties of mutual exclusion.
# Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) begins checking with a coarse (i.e. imprecise) abstraction and iteratively refines it. When a violation (i.e. counterexample) is found, the tool analyzes it for feasibility (i.e., is the violation genuine or the result of an incomplete abstraction?). If the violation is feasible, it is reported to the user. If it is not, the proof of infeasibility is used to refine the abstraction and checking begins again.

Model-checking tools were initially developed to reason about the logical correctness of discrete state systems, but have since been extended to deal with real-time and limited forms of hybrid systems.

== First-order logic ==
Model checking is also studied in the field of computational complexity theory. Specifically, a first-order logical formula is fixed without free variables and the following decision problem is considered: 

&quot;Given a finite interpretation, for instance, one described as a relational database, decide whether the interpretation is a model of the formula.&quot;

This problem is in the circuit class AC0. It is tractable when imposing some restrictions on the input structure: for instance, requiring that it has treewidth bounded by a constant (which more generally implies the tractability of model checking for monadic second-order logic), bounding the degree of every domain element, and more general conditions such as bounded expansion, locally bounded expansion, and nowhere-dense structures. These results have been extended to the task of enumerating all solutions to a first-order formula with free variables.

<text>A s&#x27;more (alternatively spelled smore, pronounced /ˈsmɔːr/, or /səˈmɔːr/) is a confection consisting of toasted marshmallow and chocolate sandwiched between two pieces of graham cracker. S&#x27;mores are popular in the United States and Canada, and are traditionally cooked over a campfire.

==Etymology and origins==
&quot;S&#x27;more&quot; is a contraction of the phrase &quot;some more&quot;. The first known s&#x27;more recipe appeared in a &quot;Campfire Marshmallows&quot; cookbook in the early 1920s, where it was called a &quot;Graham Cracker Sandwich&quot;. The text indicates that the treat was already popular with the Boy Scouts, Campfire Girls and Girl Scouts. In 1927, a recipe for &quot;Some More&quot; was published in &quot;Tramping and Trailing with the Girl Scouts&quot;. Newspaper recipes began appearing as early as 1925. 

The contracted term &quot;s&#x27;mores&quot; appears in conjunction with the recipe in a 1938 publication aimed at summer camps. A 1956 recipe uses the name &quot;S&#x27;Mores&quot;, and lists the ingredients as &quot;a sandwich of two graham crackers, toasted marshmallow, and ½ chocolate bar&quot;. A 1957 Betty Crocker cookbook contains a similar recipe under the name &quot;s&#x27;mores&quot;. 

The 1958 publication &quot;Intramural and Recreational Sports for High School and College&quot; makes reference to &quot;marshmallow toasts&quot; and &quot;s&#x27;mores hikes&quot;, as does its related predecessor, &quot;Intramural and Recreational Sports for Men and Women,&quot; published in 1949.

==Preparation==

S&#x27;mores are traditionally cooked over a campfire, although they can also be made at home over the flame of a wood-burning fireplace, in an oven, over a stove&#x27;s flame, in a microwave, with a s&#x27;mores-making kit, in an air fryer, or in a panini press. A marshmallow, usually held by a metal or wooden skewer, is heated over the fire until it is golden brown. Traditionally, the marshmallow is gooey but not burnt, but, depending on individual preference and cooking time, marshmallows can range from barely warm to charred. The roasted marshmallow is then sandwiched between two halves of a graham cracker and a piece of chocolate (or with chocolate on both top and bottom), between the graham crackers. An additional step may follow, wherein the entire sandwich is wrapped in foil and heated so that the chocolate partially melts. 

Various confections containing graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow are often sold as some derivative of a s&#x27;more, but they are not necessarily heated or served in the same shape as the traditional s&#x27;mores. The Hershey&#x27;s S&#x27;mores bar is one example. Kellogg&#x27;s Pop-Tarts also feature a s&#x27;mores variety. In the UK, the lack of graham crackers is easily improvised with digestive biscuits with a slab of Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate. Contemporary recipes can substitute other foods, such as potato chips, Nutella and Peeps, for the classic ingredients.

<text>Gorgidas (Ancient Greek: Γοργίδας) was the first known Theban military leader of the Sacred Band of Thebes around 378 BC.

Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Pelopidas&quot; mentions Gorgidas for the first time when the pro-Spartan polemarch Leontidas took over with a Spartan army and forced the pro-Athens aristocrats and supporters to leave Thebes for good in 382 BC. They later came back in 379–378 BC to take back their city and kill the tyrants. Also in &quot;Life of Pelopidas&quot;, Plutarch credits Gorgidas with the creation of the Sacred Band, which he dispersed at first throughout the front ranks of the regular infantry, with the idea that they would inspire valour. However, they were later arrayed by Pelopidas as a unit in order to make their gallantry more conspicuous.

== Cultural references ==
* In the Videssos Cycle by Harry Turtledove, there appears as a main character a Greek physician named Gorgidas, who has much in common with the men of the Sacred Band of Thebes.

* In the book &quot;My Fair Captain&quot; by J. L. Langley, the society mainly featured is based on and draws its roots from the Sacred Band of Thebes mentioning Gorgidas.

<text>Hamadan province () is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Hamadan. In the Zagros Mountains, the province covers an area of 19,546 km2.

== History ==
Hamadan province is one of the most ancient parts of Iran and its civilization. Relics of this area confirm this fact. Today&#x27;s Hamedan is what is left of Ecbatana, the Medes&#x27; capital before they formed a union with the Persians. The poet Ferdowsi says that Ecbatana was built by King Jamshid.

According to historical records, there was once a castle in this city by the name of Haft Hessar (Seven Walls) which was said to have a thousand rooms and its grandeur equalled that of the Babylon Tower.

The structures of city are related to &quot;Diya Aku&quot;, a King of the Medes from 700 BC. According to Greek records, this territory was called &#x27;Ekbatan&#x27; and &#x27;Hegmataneh&#x27; by this King, thus transformed into a huge capital.

During the Parthian era, Ctesiphon became capital of Persia, and Hamedan became the summer capital and residence of the Parthian rulers. After the Parthians, the Sassanids constructed their summer palaces in Hamedan as well.

In the year 633 when the war of Nahavand took place and Hamadan came into the hands of the invading Arabs, at times it thrived and at times it declined and witnessed hardships. During the reign of the Buwayhids, it suffered plenty of damage. In the 11th century, the Seljuks shifted their capital from Baghdad to Hamadan once again.

The city of Hamadan was always at risk during the rise and fall of powers. It was completely destroyed during the Timurid invasion. However, during the Safavid era the city thrived once more. In the 18th century, Hamadan surrendered to the Ottomans, but Hamadan was retaken by Nader Shah Afshari, and under the peace treaty between Iran and the Ottomans it was returned to Iran.

The city of Hamadan lay on the Silk Road and even in recent centuries enjoyed good prospects in commerce and trade being on the main road network in the western region of Iran.

According to local Jewish traditions, the City of Hamedan is mentioned in the Bible, as the capital of Ancient Persia in the days of King Ahasuerus in the Book of Esther. It was then known as Shushan. The Tombs of Mordecai and Esther are located in modern-day Hamadan.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
In the city of Hamadan itself, most people speak Persian. It is also spoken in some county centers. Persian is also used as a lingua franca in other areas. In the northern part of the province, most people speak Azerbaijani, and in the west, near Kermanshah and Kurdistan provinces, people speak Kurdish. Luri and Laki are also spoken in the southern areas, such as Malayer, Nahavand, and Samen.

===Religion===
The population of Hamadan province is overwhelmingly Muslim, with 99.88% of residents being Muslims as of 1996. Mostly Shia Muslim, with small populations of Sunni and Zoroastrian.

===Population===
As of 1996, Hamadan province had a population of 1,667,957 people, in 342,084 households. A little under half these people (about 811,000, or 48.3%) lived in urban areas. About half of this group lived in the city of Hamadan itself. There has been increased urbanization since the 1990s. About 868,000 people lived in rural villages. About 10,000 people belonged to migratory tribes that spent either the summer (9,128 people) or winter (837 people) in the province. The largest tribe that summers in Hamadan province is the Tork Yaram tribe, with 7,234 members, while the largest tribe that winters in the province is the Torkashvand tribe, with 608 members. As of 1996, there were 1,122 rural villages in the province, with an average population of 773 people. This average is over twice the national average for village size. The population density was 86 people per square kilometer.

Hamadan province has usually had net emigration, except for during the Iran-Iraq War when it took in a large number of refugees. This continuing emigration partly offsets the natural growth rate due to births.

Slightly over 77% of the province&#x27;s population was literate as of 1996 (83.1% for men and 71.3% for women). By this point, however, literacy was much higher in the younger population because access to primary education had increased - for example, the 6-10 age group had a literacy rate of 96.2% for boys and 94.9% for girls. Of the literate population, 53.3% had attended school up to the primary level, 40.2% had attended up to high school, and 4.2% had attended higher education.

Average household size was 4.85 members as of 1996. 67.31% of sedentary, non-communal households consisted of the head of household, spouse, and children; 9.13% consisted of a married couple with no children; 5.1% consisted of a single parent with children; and the remaining 18.5% were other types of households. A total of 8.9% of households had a woman as head of household, and 81.8% of heads of households were employed.

As of 1996, the province had no households living in tents, barracks, or &quot;other makeshift forms of housing&quot;. 98.8% of households had access to electricity and 82.8% had access to piped water. 44.2% of households had bathrooms, but there was a significant discrepancy between urban (72.1%) and rural (14.5%) households in this regard. 22.7% of households had telephones in their homes; again, this was significantly higher in urban areas (38.3%) than in rural ones (14.5%). In terms of homeownership, 78.8% of households owned their houses while 10.5% were lease holders.

As of 1997, the average annual urban household income was 11,707,000 rials and the average expenses were 10,317,000 rials or 88% of the income. For rural households, average income was 7,550,000 rials and average expenses were 6,933,000 rials or 92% of the income.

At the time of the 2006 National Census, the province&#x27;s population was 1,674,595 in 427,675 households. The following census in 2011 counted 1,758,268 people in 506,191 households. In 2014, Hamadan Province was placed in Region 4. The 2016 census measured the population of the province as 1,738,234 in 538,803 households.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The current province of Hamadan used to form a part of Kermanshah Province. At the 1956 census, the territory of the province belonged to four different governorships (&quot;farmān-dāri&quot;): Hamadan, Malayer, and Nahavand, and Tuyserkan. By the 1966 census, the general governorship (&quot;farmān-dāri-e koll&quot;) of Hamadan had been created. By the 1976 census, the general governorship had been upgraded to province status.

The population history and structural changes of Hamadan province&#x27;s administrative divisions over three consecutive censuses are shown in the following table.

=== Cities ===
Among the major cities of the province are Asadabad, Bahar, Famenin, Hamadan, Kabudarahang, Malayer, Nahavand, Razan, and Tuyserkan.

According to the 2016 census, 1,097,217 people (over 63% of the population of Hamadan province) live in the following cities:

== Geography ==

Hamadan province is located in western Iran, in the eastern reaches of the Zagros mountains. It covers about 1.2% of Iran&#x27;s total land area and shares borders with six other provinces. To the north, the province borders Qazvin and Zanjan provinces, with the Kharaqan mountains forming a natural boundary. The eastern border is with Markazi province. In the south, Mount Garu forms the natural border with Lorestan province. Finally, Hamadan province&#x27;s western neighbors are Kermanshah and Kordestan provinces.

In general, Hamadan province is a mountainous region. The Alvand range, just south of the city of Hamadan, forms the highest point. Its summit reaches 3,580 m above sea level. The lowest point in the province is 1,420 m above sea level, in the valley of the Gamasiab river near Nahavand. Most of the province&#x27;s rivers originate in the snowmelt on Mount Alvand and then flow north or south. During the summer, when there is practically no rain, all but the largest rivers either dwindle to parched streams or dry up entirely. There are two major plains in the province: one in the northeast and east, stretching from Hamadan north to Avaj in Qazvin province, and the other in the south, between Tuyserkan to Malayer.

In the past, much of the current province&#x27;s area was covered with light oak forests, but deforestation in historical times has reduced the forest cover to just 4,100 hectares, mostly in the valleys of Mount Alvand. The vast majority of the province is currently covered by either farmland (950,000 hectares, or about 48% of its total land area) or pastures (905,000 hectares, or almost 46%).

=== Mountains ===
Besides Mount Alvand, Mount Garu, and the Kharaqan range, Hamadan province contains the following major mountains:
*Mount Lashgardar, southeast of Malayer; reaches a height of 2,928 m
*Mount Khangurmaz, in Korzanrud rural district northwest of Tuyserkan; reaches a height of 2,868 m
*Mount Siahdarreh, northwest of Tuyserkan; reaches a height of 2,818 m
*Mount Safid Kuh, in Darjazin-e Olya rural district northeast of Hamadan
*Mount Garma and Mount Sarma, both near Malayer
*Mount Almuqulak, between Asadabad and Bahar; reaches a height of 2,997 m
*Mount Buqati, about 85 km northeast of Hamadan in Sardrud district

=== Rivers ===
The rivers that flow north and east from Mount Alvand are largely seasonal; they carry far less water in the summer if they flow at all. The main ones are the Talvar and the Qarachay. The Talvar is ultimately a tributary of the Safidrud, the longest river in Iran. It begins on the slopes of the Kuh-e Safid, in the northwest of the province. The Qarachay, which is also called the Siahrud, begins in the Alvand highlands between Hamadan and Malayer. It receives several tributaries in the northern Alvand area, including the Siminarud, the Khaku, and the Farjin. It then flows eastward and eventually reaches Lake Qom in Markazi province.

The main rivers south of the Alvand range are the Gamasiab, which is another name for the Karkheh River in its upper stages, and the Qelqelrud, which is itself a tributary of the Gamasiab. The Gamasiab rises southeast of Nahavand, near the lowest point in the province. It crosses the Nahavand plain before receiving the Malayer and Qelqelrud as tributaries and eventually crosses the Zagros to the southwest.

The most important dam in the province is the Ekbatan Dam (formerly called the Shahnaz Dam), which was built in 1963 on the Yalfan River some 10 km southeast of Hamadan. Its reservoir has a capacity of 12 million cubic meters and it provides 2,400 liters of water per second, which is mostly used for agricultural irrigation.

=== Climate ===
Hamadan province typically has relatively long, cold winters and mild summers. There are usually between 120 and 140 days of frost throughout the year, and mountains are snow-covered for 6–8 months of the year. Temperature extremes range from -32 °C in winter to 39 °C in summer, but average temperatures usually range between -4 °C in December and 25 °C in July. The weather is generally milder the further south one goes. During the winter, the northern plains are exposed to strong winds that blow 4 meters per second on average. These winds are humid and are also accompanied by rainfall. The province receives above-average rainfall, typically averaging 315 mm in a year. Almost no rain falls during the summer, between June and September.

=== Wildlife ===
In the valleys between the province&#x27;s mountains, there are springs and small lakes that form &quot;semi-autonomous ecosystems&quot; as home for migratory birds. For example, the seasonal marsh of Talab-e Aqgol, 20 km south of Malayer, is visited by 10 to 20 thousand birds every year during their route from the wetlands of Siberia and Scandinavia to warmer regions. These birds live here for 4 to 5 months out of the year. Among the birds that take part in this migration are geese, ducks, herons, cranes, and aigrettes.

Several wildlife reserves in the province are home to other bird and mammal species. Larger birds include royal eagles, golden eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, vultures; and larger mammals include wild goats, ibexes, wild boars, wolves, foxes, jackals, and hyenas. There are about 100 each of wolves, foxes, and jackals in the province, and the hyena population is about 20. These numbers have been fairly stable, and in general the population levels of predators and prey are balanced.

== Economy ==
Because of its above-average rainfall and easy access to water, Hamadan province has a prosperous agricultural base, and agriculture forms its largest economic sector. The province contains 1.2% of the country&#x27;s total land area, but 4.5% of its total farmland. There are about 950,000 hectares of farmland in Hamadan province, which makes up about 48% of its total area. About a third of this farmland is irrigated, while the remaining two-thirds is under dry farming (in Persian: &quot;deym&quot;) and has far lower crop yields. About 2.2 to 2.6 million tons of agricultural produce are produced annually in Hamadan province, which is about 4.8% of the country&#x27;s total. By far the largest crop in terms of area sown is wheat, with barley in a distant second. Potatoes and sugar beets, though sown over a smaller area, have extremely high yields per hectare and as a result make up large shares of the province&#x27;s produce. About 6.1% of the total farmland is orchards.

Hamadan province is rich in mineral resources. It is the biggest source of granite in the country, and it also has reserves of limestone, lead, iron ore, and zinc. As of 1998, the province had 142 active mines, including 52 sandstone mines, 36 silica mines, 19 ballas mines, 14 limestone mines, and 13 gemstone mines. In 2023, Ebrahim Ali Molla-Beigi, director general of the Exploration Affairs Office of the Iranian Ministry of Industries, Mining and Trade announced the discovery of 8.5 million tons of Lithium reserves in the province.

Small-scale handicraft industry is well-established in the province. Some of the more prominent trades include tanning, carpet weaving, ceramics production, and knitting. As of 1995, there were 266 large-scale factories in the province, employing 8,620 people. These larger factories produce things like agricultural and construction machinery, aluminum products, and steel. Food processing facilities include dairy products, canned fruits, sugar, and soft drinks. Textiles, plastics, and household goods are also produced in the province.

<doc id="321175" wikidata="Q3057291" url="?curid=321175" title="Political aspects of Islam">
<text>Political aspects of Islam are derived from the Islamic religion, which is based on the Quran, &quot;ḥadīth&quot; literature, and &quot;sunnah&quot; (accounts of the sayings and living habits attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad), and elements of political movements and tendencies followed by Muslims or Islamic states throughout the history of Islam.

Traditional political concepts in Islam which form an idealized model for Islamic rule, are based on the rule of Muhammad in Mecca (629–632 CE) and his elected or selected successors, known as Caliphs in Sunnī Islam and Imams in Shīʿa Islam. They include obedience to the Islamic law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;); pledging obedience to rulers (&quot;al-Bay&#x27;ah&quot;) with a corresponding duty of rulers to rule justly and seek consultation (&quot;shūrā&quot;) from their subjects; and the importance of rebuking unjust rulers, unity, solidarity and community, superseding individual rights and diversity. According to the French political scientist and professor Olivier Roy, &quot;Classical Islamic thought is overflowing with treatises on governing, advice to sovereigns, and didactic tales. They do not reflect on the nature of politics, but on the nature of the good ruler and of good government (advice, techniques, paradigms, anecdotes).&quot;

A significant change in the Muslim world was the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922). In the modern era (19th–20th centuries), common Islamic political themes have been resistance to Western imperialism and enforcement of &quot;sharīʿa&quot; law through democratic or militant struggle. Events such as the defeat of Arab armies in the Six-Day War and the subsequent Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank (1967), the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979), the collapse of the Soviet Union (1992), the end of the Cold War, and the fall of communism as a viable alternative have increased the appeal of Islamic movements such as Islamism, Islamic democracy, Islamic fundamentalism, and Islamic revivalism, especially in the context of the global sectarian divide and conflict between Sunnīs and Shīʿītes, along with the popular dissatisfaction with secularist ruling regimes in the Muslim world.

==Pre-modern Islam==


===Origins of Islam===


Early Islam arose within the historical, social, political, economic, and religious context of Late Antiquity in the Middle East. The second half of the 6th century CE saw political disorder in the pre-Islamic Arabian peninsula, and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions played an important role in the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion of the Himyarite Kingdom in Yemen after about 380 CE, while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf. There was also a yearning for a more &quot;spiritual form of religion&quot;, and &quot;the choice of religion increasingly became an individual rather than a collective issue.&quot; While some Arabs were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, those Abrahamic religions provided &quot;the principal intellectual and spiritual reference points&quot;, and Jewish and Christian loanwords from Aramaic began to replace the old pagan vocabulary of Arabic throughout the peninsula. The &quot;Ḥanīf&quot; (&quot;renunciates&quot;), a group of monotheists that sought to separate themselves both from the foreign Abrahamic religions and the traditional Arab polytheism, were looking for a new religious worldview to replace the pre-Islamic Arabian religions, focusing on &quot;the all-encompassing father god Allah whom they freely equated with the Jewish Yahweh and the Christian Jehovah.&quot; In their view, Mecca was originally dedicated to this monotheistic faith that they considered to be the one true religion, established by the patriarch Abraham.

According to the traditional account, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570 CE. His family belonged to the Arab clan of Quraysh, which was the chief tribe of Mecca and a dominant force in western Arabia. To counter the effects of anarchy, they upheld the institution of &quot;sacred months&quot; when all violence was forbidden and travel was safe. The polytheistic Kaaba shrine in Mecca and the surrounding area was a popular pilgrimage destination, which had significant economic consequences for the city.

The origins of Islam as a religious and political movement are to be found in the life and times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his successors. In 622 CE, in recognition of his claims to prophethood, Muhammad was invited to rule the city of Medina. At the time the local Arab tribes of Aus and Khazraj dominated the town, and were in constant conflict. Medinans considered Muhammad as an impartial outsider who could resolve the conflict. Muhammad and his followers thus moved to Medina, where Muhammad drafted the Constitution of Medina. The laws Muhammad established during his rule, based on the Quran and his own doing, are considered by Muslims to be &quot;sharīʿa&quot; or Islamic law, which Islamic movements seek to re-establish in the present day. Muhammad gained a widespread following and an army, and his rule expanded first to the city of Mecca and then spread across the Arabian peninsula through a combination of diplomacy and military conquests.

The real intentions of Muhammad regarding the spread of Islam, its political undertone, and his missionary activity (&quot;da’wah&quot;) during his lifetime are a contentious matter of debate, which has been extensively discussed both among Muslim scholars and Non-Muslim scholars within the academic field of Islamic studies. Various authors, Islamic activists, and historians of Islam have proposed several understandings of Muhammad&#x27;s intent and ambitions regarding his religio-political mission in the context of the pre-Islamic Arabian society and the founding of his own religion. Larry Poston asks,

===Quran===
Most likely Muhammad was &quot;intimately aware of Jewish belief and practices,&quot; and acquainted with the &quot;Ḥanīf&quot;. Like the &quot;Ḥanīf&quot;, Muhammad practiced &quot;Taḥannuth&quot;, spending time in seclusion at mount Hira and &quot;turning away from paganism.&quot; When he was about 40 years old, he began receiving at mount Hira&#x27; what Muslims regard as divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran. These inspirations urged him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith, as the final expression of Biblical prophetism earlier codified in the sacred texts of Judaism and Christianity; to warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day; and to castigate social injustices of his city. Muhammad&#x27;s message won over a handful of followers (the &quot;ṣaḥāba&quot;) and was met with increasing opposition from Meccan notables. In 622 CE, a few years after losing protection with the death of his influential uncle ʾAbū Ṭālib ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, Muhammad migrated to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina) where he was joined by his followers. Later generations would count this event, known as the &quot;hijra&quot;, as the start of the Islamic era.

In Yathrib, where he was accepted as an arbitrator among the different communities of the city under the terms of the Constitution of Medina, Muhammad began to lay the foundations of the new Islamic society, with the help of new Quranic verses which provided guidance on matters of law and religious observance. The surahs of this period emphasized his place among the long line of Biblical prophets, but also differentiated the message of the Quran from the sacred texts of Christianity and Judaism. Armed conflict with the Arab Meccans and Jewish tribes of the Yathrib area soon broke out. After a series of military confrontations and political manoeuvres, Muhammad was able to secure control of Mecca and allegiance of the Quraysh in 629 CE. In the time remaining until his death in 632 CE, tribal chiefs across the Arabian peninsula entered into various agreements with him, some under terms of alliance, others acknowledging his claims of prophethood and agreeing to follow Islamic practices, including paying the alms levy to his government, which consisted of a number of deputies, an army of believers, and a public treasury.
In Islam, &quot;the Qurʾān is conceived by Muslims to be the word of God spoken to Muḥammad and then passed on to humanity in exactly the same form as it was received&quot;. While the Quran doesn&#x27;t dwell on politics, it does make mention of concepts such as &quot;the oppressed&quot; (&quot;mustad&#x27;afeen&quot;), &quot;emigration&quot; (&quot;hijra&quot;), the &quot;Muslim community&quot; (&quot;Ummah&quot;), and &quot;fighting&quot; or &quot;struggling&quot; in the way of God (&quot;jihād&quot;), that can have political implications. A number of Quranic verses (such as ) talk about the &quot;mustad&#x27;afeen&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;those deemed weak&quot;, &quot;underdogs&quot;, or &quot;the oppressed&quot;, how they are put upon by people such as the pharaoh, how God wishes them to be treated justly, and how they should emigrate from the land where they are oppressed (). Abraham was an &quot;emigrant unto my Lord&quot; (). War against &quot;unbelievers&quot; (&quot;kuffār&quot;) is commanded and divine aid promised, although some verses state this may be when unbelievers start the war and treaties may end the war. The Quran also devotes some verses to the proper division of spoils captured in war among the victors. War against internal enemies or &quot;hypocrites&quot; (&quot;munāfiḳūn&quot;) is also commanded. Some commands did not extend past the life of Muhammad, such as ones to refer quarrels to Allah and Muhammad or not to shout at or raise your voice when talking to Muhammad. Limiting its political teaching is the fact that the Quran doesn&#x27;t mention &quot;any formal and continuing structure of authority&quot;, only orders to obey Muhammad, and that its themes were of limited use when the success of Islam meant governance of &quot;a vast territory populate mainly peasants, and dominate by cities and states&quot; alien to nomadic life in the desert.

===Islamic State of Medina===
The Constitution of Medina was drafted by Muhammad. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as Medina), including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Arab Pagans. This constitution formed the basis of the first Islamic state. The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws (Aus and Khazraj) within Medina. To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish, Christian, and Pagan communities of Medina, bringing them within the fold of one community: the &quot;Ummah&quot;.

The precise dating of the Constitution of Medina remains debated but generally scholars agree it was written shortly after the &quot;hijra&quot; (622 CE).

It effectively established the first Islamic state. The Constitution established: the security of the community, religious freedoms, the role of Medina as a &quot;haram&quot; or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the security of women, stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of blood money (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of &quot;lex talionis&quot;).

===Early Caliphate and political ideals===


After the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, his community needed to appoint a new leader, giving rise to the title of &quot;caliph&quot; (). Thus, the subsequent Islamic empires were known as &quot;caliphates&quot;, and a series of four caliphs governed the early Islamic empire: Abū Bakr (632–634), ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (Umar І, 634–644), ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān (644–656), and ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (656–661). These leaders are known as the &quot;rāshidūn&quot; (&quot;rightly-guided&quot;) caliphs in Sunnī Islam. They oversaw the initial phase of the early Muslim conquests, advancing through Persia, the Levant, Egypt, and North Africa.

Alongside the growth of the Umayyad Caliphate, the major political development within early Islam in this period was the sectarian split and political divide between Kharijite, Sunnī, and Shīʿa Muslims; this had its roots in a dispute over the succession for the role of caliph. Sunnīs believed the caliph was elective and any Muslim from the Arab clan of Quraysh, the tribe of Muhammad, might serve as one. Shīʿītes, on the other hand, believed the title of caliph should be hereditary in the bloodline of Muhammad, and thus all the caliphs, with the exceptions of Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib and his firstborn son Ḥasan, were actually illegitimate usurpers. However, the Sunnī sect emerged as triumphant in most regions of the Muslim world, with the exceptions of Iran and Oman; thus, most modern Islamic political ideologies and movements are founded in Sunnī thought. Muhammad&#x27;s closest companions (&quot;ṣaḥāba&quot;), the four &quot;rightly-guided&quot; caliphs who succeeded him, continued to expand the Islamic empire to encompass Jerusalem, Ctesiphon, and Damascus, and sending Arab Muslim armies as far as the Sindh region. The early Islamic empire stretched from al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) to the Punjab region under the reign of the Umayyad dynasty.

An important Islamic concept concerning the structure of ruling is the &quot;shura&quot; or &quot;consultation&quot; with people regarding their affairs, which is the duty of rulers mentioned in two Quranic verses: and . One type of ruler not part of the Islamic ideal was the king, which was disparaged in the Quranic mentions of the Pharaoh, &quot;the prototype of the unjust and tyrannical ruler&quot; (, ) and elsewhere (). The phrase &quot;Ahl al-Ḥall wa’l-‘Aḳd&quot; ( or sometimes &#x27;the people of the solution and the contract&#x27;) was used in order to denote those qualified to appoint or depose a caliph or another ruler on behalf of the Ummah. 

====Election or appointment====

Al-Mawardi, a Sunnī Muslim jurist of the Shāfiʿī school of Islamic jurisprudence, wrote that the caliph should be a member of the Quraysh tribe. Abu Bakr al-Baqillani, an Ashʿarī Sunnī Muslim scholar and Mālikī jurist, wrote that the leader of the Muslims simply should be elected from the majority. Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man, the founder of the Sunnī Ḥanafī school, also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.

Western scholar of Islam, Fred Donner, argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader&#x27;s death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this &quot;shura&quot;, or consultative assembly. Candidates were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunnī view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone.

====&quot;Majlis ash-Shura&quot;====
Deliberations in the politics of the early caliphates, most notably the Rāshidūn Caliphate, were not &quot;democratic&quot; in the modern sense of the term; rather, decision-making power laid with a council (&quot;shura&quot;) of notable and trusted companions of Muhammad (&quot;ṣaḥāba&quot;) and representatives of different Arab tribes (most of them selected or elected within their tribes). Traditional Sunnī Muslim jurists agree that the &quot;shura&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;consultation&quot;, is a function of the Islamic caliphate. The &quot;Majlis-ash-Shura&quot; advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Quran:

The &quot;majlis&quot; were also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi wrote that members of the &quot;majlis&quot; should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also stated that in case of emergencies when there is no caliphate and no &quot;majlis&quot;, the people themselves should institute a council of &quot;majlis&quot;, select a list of candidates for the role of caliph, then the &quot;majlis&quot; should select from the list of candidates.

Some modern political interpretations regarding the role of the &quot;Majlis ash-Shura&quot; include those expressed by the Egyptian Islamist author and ideologue Sayyid Qutb, prominent member of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Palestinian Muslim scholar and propagandist Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, founder of the pan-Islamist political party Hizb ut-Tahrir. In an analysis of the &quot;shura&quot; chapter of the Quran, Qutb argued that Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of divine laws that the ruler must execute. Al-Nabhani argued that the &quot;shura&quot; is important and part of &quot;the ruling structure&quot; of the Islamic caliphate, &quot;but not one of its pillars&quot;, and may be neglected without the caliphate&#x27;s rule becoming un-Islamic. However, these interpretations formulated by Qutb and al-Nabhani are not universally accepted in the Islamic political thought, and Islamic democrats consider the &quot;shura&quot; to be an integral part and important pillar of Islamic political system.

====Separation of powers====
In the early Islamic caliphates, the caliph was the head of state, and had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad&#x27;s political authority, who, according to Sunnī Muslims, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives, as was the case for the election of Abū Bakr (632–634), ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān (644–656), and ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (656–661). After the &quot;rāshidūn&quot; caliphs, later caliphates during the Islamic Golden Age had a much lesser degree of democratic participation, but since &quot;no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue&quot; in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held public consultations with the people in their affairs.

The legislative power of the caliph (or later, the sultan) was always restricted by the scholarly class, the &quot;ulama&quot;, a group regarded as the guardians of Islamic law. Since the &quot;sharia&quot; law was established and regulated by the schools of Islamic jurisprudence, this prevented the caliph from dictating legal results. &quot;Sharia&quot;-compliant rulings were established as authoritative based on the &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus) of legal Muslim scholars, who theoretically acted as representatives of the entire &quot;Ummah&quot; (Muslim community). After law colleges (&quot;madrasa&quot;) became widespread beginning with the 11th and 12th century CE, students of Islamic jurisprudence often had to obtain an &quot;ijaza-t al-tadris wa-l-ifta&quot; (&quot;license to teach and issue legal opinions&quot;) in order to issue valid legal rulings. In many ways, classical Islamic law functioned like a constitutional law.

Practically, for hundreds of years after the fall of the Rāshidūn Caliphate (7th century CE) and until the first half of the 20th century, Muslim-majority countries usually adopted a system of government based on the coexistence of the sultan and &quot;ulama&quot; which followed the rules of the &quot;sharia&quot; law. This system resembled to some extent some Western governments in possessing an unwritten constitution (like the United Kingdom), and possessing separate, countervailing branches of government (like the United States), which provided a clear separation of powers in socio-political governance. While the United States and some other systems of government have three separate branches of government—executive, legislative, and judicial—Islamic monarchies had two: the sultan and the &quot;ulama&quot;.

According to the French political scientist and professor Olivier Roy, this &quot;&quot;de facto&quot; separation between political power&quot; of sultans and emirs and religious power of the caliph was &quot;created and institutionalized ... as early as the end of the first century of the hegira.&quot; The sovereign&#x27;s religious function was to defend the Muslim community against its enemies, institute the sharia, ensure the public good (&quot;maslaha&quot;). The state was instrument to enable Muslims to live as good Muslims and Muslims were to obey the sultan if he did so. The legitimacy of the ruler was &quot;symbolized by the right to coin money and to have the Friday prayer (&quot;Jumu&#x27;ah khutba&quot;) said in his name.&quot;

British lawyer and journalist Sadakat Kadri argues that a large &quot;degree of deference&quot; was shown to the caliphate by the ulama and this was at least at times &quot;counterproductive&quot;. &quot;Although jurists had identified conditions from mental incapacity to blindness that could disqualify a caliph, none had ever dared delineate the powers of the caliphate as an institution.&quot; During the Abbasid caliphate:

When Caliph Al-Mutawakkil had been killed in 861, jurists had retroactively validated his murder with a fatwa. Eight years later, they had testified to the lawful abdication of a successor, after he had been dragged from a toilet, beaten unconscious, and thrown into a vault to die. By the middle of the tenth century, judges were solemnly confirming that the onset of blindness had disqualified a caliph, without mentioning that they had just been assembled to witness the gouging of his eyes.
According to Noah Feldman, law professor at Harvard University, the Muslim legal scholars and jurists lost their control over Islamic law due to the codification of &quot;sharia&quot; by the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century:

===Obedience and opposition===
According to scholar Moojan Momen, &quot;One of the key statements in the Qur&#x27;an around which much of the exegesis&quot; on the issue of what Islamic doctrine says about who is in charge is based on the verse 
&quot;O believers! Obey God and obey the Apostle and those who have been given authority [&quot;uulaa al-amr&quot;] among you&quot; ().
For Sunnīs, the expression &quot;those who have been given authority&quot; (&quot;uulaa al-amr&quot;) refers to the rulers (caliphs and kings), but for Shīʿas it refers to the Imams. According to the British historian and Orientalist scholar Bernard Lewis, this Quranic verse has been
elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, &quot;there is no obedience in sin&quot;; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, &quot;do not obey a creature against his creator,&quot; again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.

According to the exegetical interpretation of the medieval Sunnī Muslim scholar Ibn Taymiyyah, for this verse &quot;there is no obedience in sin&quot;; that people should ignore the order of the ruler if it would disobey the divine law and shouldn&#x27;t use this as excuse for revolution because it will spill Muslims&#x27; blood. According to Ibn Taymiyyah, the saying &quot;sixty years with an unjust imam is better than one night without a sultan&quot; was confirmed by experience. He believed that the Quranic injunction to &quot;enjoin good and forbid evil&quot; (&quot;al-amr bi-l-maʿrūf wa-n-nahy ʿani-l-munkar&quot;, found in , , and other verses) was the duty of every state functionary with charge over other Muslims, from the caliph to &quot;the schoolmaster in charge of assessing children&#x27;s handwriting exercises.&quot;

===Sharia and governance (&quot;siyasa&quot;)===
Starting from the late medieval period, Sunni fiqh elaborated the doctrine of &quot;siyasa shar&#x27;iyya&quot;, which literally means governance according to sharia, and is sometimes called the political dimension of Islamic law. Its goal was to harmonize Islamic law with the practical demands of statecraft. The doctrine emphasized the religious purpose of political authority and advocated non-formalist application of Islamic law if required by expedience and utilitarian considerations. It first emerged in response to the difficulties raised by the strict procedural requirements of Islamic law. The law rejected circumstantial evidence and insisted on witness testimony, making criminal convictions difficult to obtain in courts presided over by &quot;qadis&quot; (sharia judges). In response, Islamic jurists permitted greater procedural latitude in limited circumstances, such as adjudicating grievances against state officials in the &quot;mazalim&quot; courts administered by the ruler&#x27;s council and application of &quot;corrective&quot; discretionary punishments for petty offenses. However, under the Mamluk sultanate, non-qadi courts expanded their jurisdiction to commercial and family law, running in parallel with sharia courts and dispensing with some formalities prescribed by fiqh. Further developments of the doctrine attempted to resolve this tension between statecraft and jurisprudence. In later times the doctrine has been employed to justify legal changes made by the state in consideration of public interest, as long as they were deemed not to be contrary to sharia. It was, for example, invoked by the Ottoman rulers who promulgated a body of administrative, criminal, and economic laws known as &quot;qanun&quot;.

===Shīʿa tradition===
In Shīʿa Islam, three attitudes towards rulers predominated — political cooperation with the ruler, political activism challenging the ruler, and aloofness from politics — with &quot;writings of Shi&#x27;i ulama through the ages&quot; showing &quot;elements of all three of these attitudes.&quot;

===Kharijite tradition===

Islamic extremism dates back to the early history of Islam with the emergence of the Kharijites in the 7th century CE. The original schism between Kharijites, Sunnīs, and Shīʿas among Muslims was disputed over the political and religious succession to the guidance of the Muslim community (&quot;Ummah&quot;) after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunnī and Shīʿa Muslims. Shīʿas believe ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib is the true successor to Muhammad, while Sunnīs consider Abu Bakr to hold that position. The Kharijites broke away from both the Shīʿas and the Sunnīs during the First Fitna (the first Islamic Civil War); they were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to &quot;takfīr&quot; (excommunication), whereby they declared both Sunnī and Shīʿa Muslims to be either infidels (&quot;kuffār&quot;) or false Muslims (&quot;munāfiḳūn&quot;), and therefore deemed them worthy of death for their perceived apostasy (&quot;ridda&quot;).

The Islamic tradition traces the origin of the Kharijities to the battle between ʿAlī and Mu&#x27;awiya at Siffin in 657 CE. When ʿAlī was faced with a military stalemate and agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration, some of his party withdrew their support from him. &quot;Judgement belongs to God alone&quot; (لاَ حُكْكْ إلَا لِلّهِ) became the slogan of these secessionists. They also called themselves &quot;al-Shurat&quot; (&quot;the Vendors&quot;), to reflect their willingness to sell their lives in martyrdom.

These original Kharijites opposed both ʿAlī and Mu&#x27;awiya, and appointed their own leaders. They were decisively defeated by ʿAlī, who was in turn assassinated by a Kharijite. Kharijites engaged in guerilla warfare against the Umayyads, but only became a movement to be reckoned with during the Second Fitna (the second Islamic Civil War) when they at one point controlled more territory than any of their rivals. The Kharijites were, in fact, one of the major threats to Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s bid for the caliphate; during this time they controlled Yamama and most of southern Arabia, and captured the oasis town of al-Ta&#x27;if.

The Azariqa, considered to be the extreme faction of the Kharijites, controlled parts of western Iran under the Umayyads until they were finally put down in 699 CE. The more moderate Ibadi Kharijites were longer-lived, continuing to wield political power in North and East Africa and in eastern Arabia during the Abbasid period. Because of their readiness to declare any opponent as apostate, the extreme Kharijites tended to fragment into small groups. One of the few points that the various Kharijite splinter groups held in common was their view of the caliphate, which differed from other Muslim theories on two points.

* First, they were principled egalitarians, holding that any pious Muslim (&quot;even an Ethiopian slave&quot;) can become Caliph and that family or tribal affiliation is inconsequential. The only requirements for leadership are piety and acceptance by the community. 
* Second, they agreed that it is the duty of the believers to depose any leader who falls into error. This second principle had profound implications for Kharijite theology. Applying these ideas to the early history of the caliphate, Kharijites only accept Abu Bakr and &#x27;Umar as legitimate caliphs. Of &#x27;Uthman&#x27;s caliphate they recognize only the first six years as legitimate, and they reject &#x27;Ali altogether.

By the time that Ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; wrote his political treatise early in the &#x27;Abbasid period, the Kharijites were no longer a significant political threat, at least in the Islamic heartlands. The memory of the menace they had posed to Muslim unity and of the moral challenge generated by their pious idealism still weighed heavily on Muslim political and religious thought, however. Even if the Kharijites could no longer threaten, their ghosts still had to be answered. The Ibadis are the only Kharijite group to survive into modern times.

===Quietism===
Some schools of thought in Islam, usually called Quietist, hold that politics should be left to rulers. Rationales for quietism may differ. They include agreement with the sayings above (&quot;Obey God and obey the Apostle and those who have been given authority among you&quot;, &quot;sixty years with an unjust imam is better than one night without a sultan&quot;) and the importance of obedience to authority; the belief that the duty of the Muslim public is practicing piety, prayer, religious rituals and personal virtue, rather than questioning authority; that politics involves factions and factions mean disunity in the community (ummah), something that is against Islam. Alternately, Quietism may refer to a &quot;temporary&quot; opposition to political activism, which will be lifted at the right time in the future, when (depending on the sect of Muslim), a consensus of Islamic scholars (in Sunni Islam), or the twelfth imam (in Twelver Shia Islam) call for it, all Muslims should support a true Islamic government.

==Modern era==
===Reaction to European colonialism===
European kingdoms began establishing embassies and diplomatic missions to the Ottoman Empire between the 15th and 16th centuries in order to create closer, and more friendly, relationships with the Ottoman Turks (&quot;see also&quot;: Franco-Ottoman alliance). The fear of Ottoman expansion and its implications on religion in Europe finally dissipated by the 17th century. By this time in history, the Ottoman Empire was perceived by Western Europeans as a perplexing and exotic land that they referred to as &quot;the Orient&quot;; Orientalism, as it pertains to the Ottomans, was a method employed by Westerners to attempt to understand life in the Ottoman Empire. The last hundred years of the Ottoman Empire brought about the period in which the rest of European countries looked upon it as the &quot;Sick man of Europe&quot;, as it was widely held that the Ottoman Empire was a stagnant nation and incapable of modernizing. This thesis was used throughout most of the 20th century as the basis of both Western and Republican Turkish understanding of Ottoman history. However, by 1978, historians had begun to reexamine the fundamental assumptions of the Ottoman decline thesis.

In the 19th century, European colonization of the Muslim world coincided with the French conquest of Algeria (1830), the fall of the Mughal Empire in India (1857), the Russian incursions into the Caucasus (1828) and Central Asia (1830-1895), and ultimately in the 20th century with the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922), to which the Ottoman officer and Turkish revolutionary statesman Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had an instrumental role in ending and replacing it with the Republic of Turkey, a modern, secular democracy (&quot;see also&quot;: Abolition of the Caliphate, Abolition of the Ottoman sultanate, Kemalism, and Secularism in Turkey).

The first Muslim reaction to European colonization was of &quot;peasant and religious&quot;, not urban origin. &quot;Charismatic leaders&quot;, generally members of the &quot;ulama&quot; or leaders of religious orders, launched the call for &quot;jihad&quot; and formed tribal coalitions. &quot;Sharia&quot;, in defiance of local common law, was imposed to unify tribes. Examples include Abd al-Qadir in Algeria, Muhammad Ahmad in Sudan, Shamil in the Caucasus, the Senussi in Libya and Chad, Mullah-i Lang in Afghanistan, the Akhund of Swat in India, and later, Abd al-Karim in Morocco. All these movements eventually failed &quot;despite spectacular victories such as the massacre of the British army in Afghanistan in 1842 and the taking of Kharoum in 1885.&quot;
Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif and Emir of Mecca from 1908, enthroned himself as King of the Hejaz after proclaiming the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, and continued to hold both of the offices of Sharif and King from 1916 to 1924. At the end of his reign he also briefly laid claim to the office of Sharifian Caliph; he was a 37th-generation direct descendant of Muhammad, as he belongs to the Hashemite family. A member of the Dhawu Awn clan (Banu Hashim) from the Qatadid emirs of Mecca, he was perceived to have rebellious inclinations and in 1893 was summoned to Istanbul, where he was kept on the Council of State. In 1908, in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution, he was appointed Emir of Mecca by the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II. In 1916, with the promise of British support for Arab independence, he proclaimed the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire, accusing the Committee of Union and Progress of violating tenets of Islam and limiting the power of the sultan-caliph. Shortly after the outbreak of the revolt, Hussein declared himself &quot;King of the Arab Countries&quot;. However, his pan-Arab aspirations were not accepted by the Allies, who recognized him only as King of the Hejaz. In the aftermath of World War I, Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, in protest at the Balfour Declaration and the establishment of British and French mandates in Syria, Iraq, and Palestine. He later refused to sign the Anglo-Hashemite Treaty and thus deprived himself of British support when his kingdom was attacked by Ibn Saud. After the Kingdom of Hejaz was invaded by the Al Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan, on 23 December 1925 King Hussein bin Ali surrendered to the Saudis, bringing both the Kingdom of Hejaz and the Sharifate of Mecca to an end.

The second Muslim reaction to European encroachment later in the century and early 20th century was not violent resistance but the adoption of some Western political, social, cultural and technological ways. Members of the urban elite, particularly in Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, advocated and practiced &quot;Westernization&quot;. The failure of the attempts at political westernization, according to some, was exemplified by the Tanzimat reorganization of the Ottoman rulers. &quot;Sharia&quot; was codified into law (which was called the Mecelle) and an elected legislature was established to make law. These steps took away the &quot;ulama&quot;&#x27;s role of &quot;discovering&quot; the law and the formerly powerful scholar class weakened and withered into religious functionaries, while the legislature was suspended less than a year after its inauguration and never recovered to replace the Ulama as a separate &quot;branch&quot; of government providing separation of powers. The &quot;paradigm of the executive as a force unchecked by either the sharia of the scholars or the popular authority of an elected legislature became the dominant paradigm in most of the Sunni Muslim world in the 20th century.&quot;

===Modern political ideal of the Islamic state===


In addition to the legitimacy given by medieval scholarly opinion, nostalgia for the days of successful Islamic empires simmered under later Western colonialism. This nostalgia played a major role in the Islamist political ideal of the Islamic state, a state in which Islamic law is preeminent. The Islamist political program is generally to be accomplished by re-shaping the governments of existing Muslim nation-states; but the means of doing this varies greatly across movements and circumstances. Many democratic Islamist movements, such as the Jamaat-e-Islami and Muslim Brotherhood, have used the democratic process and focus on votes and coalition-building with other political parties.
Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian Islamist ideologue and prominent figurehead of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, was influential in promoting the pan-Islamist ideology in the 1960s. When he was executed by the Egyptian government under the regime of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Ayman al-Zawahiri formed the organization Egyptian Islamic Jihad to replace the government with an Islamic state that would reflect Qutb&#x27;s ideas for the Islamic revival that he yearned for. The Qutbist ideology has been influential on jihadist movements and Islamic terrorists that seek to overthrow secular governments, most notably Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri of al-Qaeda, as well as the Salafi-jihadi terrorist group ISIL/ISIS/IS/Daesh. Moreover, Qutb&#x27;s books have been frequently been cited by Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki.

Sayyid Qutb could be said to have founded the actual movement of radical Islam. Radical Islamic movements such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban embrace the militant Islamist ideology, and were prominent for being part of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Both of the aforementioned militant Islamist groups had a role to play in the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, presenting both &quot;near&quot; and &quot;far&quot; enemies as regional governments and the United States respectively. They also took part in the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005. The recruits often came from the ranks of jihadists, from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco.

Jihadism has been defined otherwise as a neologism for militant, predominantly Sunnī Islamic movements that use ideologically-motivated violence to defend the &quot;Ummah&quot; (the collective Muslim world) from foreign Non-Muslims and those that they perceive as domestic infidels. The term &quot;jihadist globalism&quot; is also often used in relation to Islamic terrorism as a globalist ideology, and more broadly to the War on Terror. The Austrian-American academic Manfred B. Steger, Professor of Sociology at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, proposed an extension of the term &quot;jihadist globalism&quot; to apply to all extremely violent strains of religiously influenced ideologies that articulate the global imaginary into concrete political agendas and terrorist strategies; these include al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah, Hamas, and Hezbollah, which he finds &quot;today&#x27;s most spectacular manifestation of religious globalism&quot;.

===Opposition to political Islam===

At least one historian (Jebran Chamieh) argues against the Islamist tenet that there is such a thing as &quot;Islamic state&quot; or government, i.e. one whose special rules and structure that can be drawn from studying the preaching and practices of Muhammad and early Muslims, and that Muslims are obligated to at least strive to establish this state. While it is true Muhammad exercised the executive power, commanded armies, controlled the finances and revenues, made legal judgements, he created no organized system for these functions. 

Chamieh also points out that this practice (or lack thereof) was followed by the Rashidun caliphate, who never established a &quot;police force to keep law and order&quot;. When &quot;the rebels attacked Caliph Othman in his house and assassinated him, no security measures were available to protect him. The caliphs did not establish an administration, a fiscal system, or a budget ... In the conquered lands, they retained the previous Byzantine and Persian administrative systems and kept the local employees to administer the country.&quot;

===Compatibility with democracy===

====General Muslim views====
Western scholars John Esposito and Natana J. DeLong-Bas distinguish four attitudes toward sharia and democracy prominent among Muslims today:

* Advocacy of democratic ideas, often accompanied by a belief that they are compatible with Islam, which can play a public role within a democratic system, as exemplified by many protestors who took part in the Arab Spring uprisings;
* Support for democratic procedures such as elections, combined with religious or moral objections toward some aspects of Western democracy seen as incompatible with sharia, as exemplified by Islamic scholars like Yusuf al-Qaradawi;
* Rejection of democracy as a Western import and advocacy of traditional Islamic institutions, such as &quot;shura&quot; (consultation) and &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus), as exemplified by supporters of absolute monarchy and radical Islamist movements;
* Belief that democracy requires restricting religion to private life, held by a minority in the Muslim world.

Polls conducted by Gallup and Pew Research Center in Muslim-majority countries indicate that most Muslims see no contradiction between democratic values and religious principles, desiring neither a theocracy, nor a secular democracy, but rather a political model where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of &quot;sharia&quot;.

====Islamic political theories====
Muslih and Browers identify three major perspectives on democracy among prominent Muslims thinkers who have sought to develop modern, distinctly Islamic theories of socio-political organization conforming to Islamic values and law:

* The rejectionist Islamic view, elaborated by Muhammad Rashid Rida, Sayyid Qutb and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, condemns imitation of foreign ideas, drawing a distinction between Western democracy and the Islamic doctrine of &quot;shura&quot; (consultation between ruler and ruled). This perspective, which stresses comprehensive implementation of &quot;sharia&quot;, was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s among various movements seeking to establish an Islamic state, but its popularity has diminished in recent years.
* The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest), &quot;ʿadl&quot; (justice), and &quot;shura&quot;. Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest, as defined through &quot;shura&quot;. In this view, &quot;shura&quot; provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western liberal values. Hasan al-Turabi, Rashid al-Ghannushi, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have advocated different forms of this view.
* The liberal Islamic view is influenced by Muhammad Abduh&#x27;s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion. It stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Authors like Fahmi Huwaidi and Tariq al-Bishri have constructed Islamic justifications for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic state by drawing on early Islamic texts. Others, like Mohammed Arkoun and Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, have justified pluralism and freedom through non-literalist approaches to textual interpretation. Abdolkarim Soroush has argued for a &quot;religious democracy&quot; based on religious thought that is democratic, tolerant, and just. Islamic liberals argue for the necessity of constant reexamination of religious understanding, which can only be done in a democratic context.

===20th and 21st centuries===


Following World War I, the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, and the subsequent abolition of the Caliphate by the Turkish nationalist and revolutionary Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern Republic of Turkey, many Muslims perceived that the political power of their religion was in retreat. There was also concern that Western ideas and influence were spreading throughout Muslim societies due to Western colonialism; this led to considerable resentment of the influence of the European powers. The Muslim Brotherhood emerged in the Kingdom of Egypt as a politico-religious movement aimed to resist British colonial efforts and oppose Western cultural influence in the MENA region.

Between the 1950s and the 1960s, the predominant ideology within the Arab world was pan-Arabism, which de-emphasized religion and encouraged the creation of socialist, secular states based on Arab nationalist ideologies such as Nasserism and Baathism rather than Islam. However, governments based on Arab nationalism have found themselves facing economic stagnation and disorder. Increasingly, the borders of these states were seen as artificial colonial creations - which they were, having literally been drawn on a map by European colonial powers.

Today, many Islamist and Islamic democratic political parties exist in most Muslim-majority countries, alongside numerous insurgent Islamic extremist, militant Islamist, and terrorist movements and organizations. Both of the following terms, Islamic democracy and Islamic fundamentalism, lump together a large variety of political groups with varying aims, histories, ideologies, and backgrounds.

====Contemporary movements====
Some common political currents in Islam include:
*Sunni Traditionalism, which accepts traditional commentaries on the Quran, &quot;hadith&quot; literature, and &quot;sunnah&quot;, and &quot;takes as its basic principle imitation (&quot;taqlid&quot;), that is, refusal to innovate&quot;, follows one of the four legal schools or &quot;Madh&#x27;hab&quot; (Shafiʽi, Maliki, Hanafi, Hanbali), and may include Sufism. An example of Sufi traditionalism is the Barelvi school in Pakistan.
*Fundamentalist reformism or revivalism, which criticizes the Islamic scholastic tradition, the commentaries, popular religious practices such as visitation to and veneration of the shrines and tombs of Muslim saints, perceived deviations and superstitions; it aims to return to the founding scriptures of Islam. This fundamentalist reformism generally developed in response to a perceived external threat (for example, the influence of Hinduism on Islam). 18th-century examples of fundamentalist Muslim reformers are Shah Waliullah Dehlawi in British India and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the Arabian peninsula, founder of the Islamic doctrine and movement known as Wahhabism. Salafism and Wahhabism worldwide, the Deobandi school in South Asia (mainly Pakistan and Afghanistan), Ahl-i Hadith and Tablighi Jamaat in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan are modern examples of fundamentalist reformism and revivalism.
*Islamism or political Islam, embracing a return to the &quot;sharia&quot; or Islamic law but adopting Western terminology such as revolution, ideology, politics, and democracy, and taking a more liberal attitude towards issues like &quot;jihad&quot; and women&#x27;s rights. Contemporary examples include the Jamaat-e-Islami, Muslim Brotherhood, Iranian Islamic Revolution, Masyumi party, United Malays National Organisation, Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party and Justice and Development Party (Turkey).
*Liberal and progressive movements within Islam generally define themselves in opposition to Islamist and Islamic fundamentalist political movements, but often embrace many of their anti-imperialist and Islam-inspired liberal reformist elements. Liberal Muslims affirm the promotion of progressive values such as democracy, gender equality, human rights, LGBT rights, women&#x27;s rights, religious pluralism, interfaith marriage, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, and freedom of religion; opposition to theocracy and total rejection of Islamism and Islamic fundamentalism; and a modern view of Islamic theology, ethics, &quot;sharia&quot;, culture, tradition, and other ritualistic practices in Islam. Liberal Islam emphasizes the re-interpretation of the Islamic scriptures in order to preserve their relevance in the 21st century.

====Shīʿa—Sunnī differences====

According to the Iranian-American academic Vali Nasr, which serves as Majid Khaddouri Professor of International Affairs and Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), political tendencies of Shīʿa and Sunnī Islamic ideologies differ, with Sunnī fundamentalism &quot;in Pakistan and much of the Arab world&quot; being &quot;far from politically revolutionary&quot;, primarily focused on attempting to Islamicize the political establishment rather than trying to change it through revolutionary struggle, whereas the Shīʿīte conception of political Islam is strongly influenced by Ruhollah Khomeini and his talk of the oppression of the poor and class war, which characterized the success of the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1978–1979):

The American political analyst and author Graham E. Fuller, specialized in the study of Islamism and Islamic extremism, has also noted that he found &quot;no mainstream Islamist organization (with the exception of [Shīʿa] Iran) with radical social views or a revolutionary approach to the social order apart from the imposition of legal justice.&quot;

====Guardianship of the Jurist of Shi&#x27;i Islam====

Guardianship of the Jurist (&quot;Wilāyat al-Faqīh&quot;) is a concept in Twelver Shia Islamic law that holds that in the absence of (what Twelvers believe is) the religious and political leader of Islam—the &quot;infallible Imam&quot;, who Shi&#x27;a believe will reappear sometime before Judgement Day) -- righteous Shi&#x27;i jurists (&quot;faqīh&quot;), should administer &quot;some&quot; of the &quot;religious and social affairs&quot; of the Shi&#x27;i community. In its &quot;absolute&quot; form—the form advanced by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the basis of government in Islamic Republic of Iran—the state and society are ruled by an Islamic jurist (Ali Khamenei as of 2022).

A variation of Islamism, the theory holds that since sharia law has everything needed to rule a state (whether ancient or modern), and any other basis of governance will lead to injustice and sin, a state must be ruled according to sharia and the person who should rule is an expert in sharia.

The theory of sovereignty of the Guardianship of the Jurist (in fact of all Islam) explained by at least one conservative Shi&#x27;i scholar (Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi), is contrasted with the theory of sovereignty in &quot;most of the schools of political philosophy and other cultures&quot;. Non-Muslim cultures hold that &quot;every man is free&quot;, and in democratic cultures in particular, &quot;sovereignty ... belongs to the people&quot;. A ruler and government must have the consent of the governed to have political legitimacy. Whereas in fact, sovereignty is God&#x27;s. The &quot;entire universe and whatever in it belongs to God ... the Exalted, and all their movements and acts must have to be in accordance with the command or prohibition of the Real Owner&quot;. Consequently, human beings &quot;have no right to rule over others or to choose someone to rule&quot;, i.e. choose someone to rule themselves. In an Islamic state, rule must be according to God&#x27;s law and the ruler must be best person to enforce God&#x27;s law. The people&#x27;s &quot;consent and approval&quot; are valuable for developing and strengthening the Islamic government but irrelevant for its legitimacy.

*Merryl Wyn Davies, &quot;Beyond Frontiers: Islam and Contemporary Needs&quot;
*G. H. Jansen, &quot;Militant Islam&quot;, 1980
*Hamid Enayat, &quot;Modern Islamic Political Thought&quot;

These authors in general locate the issues of Islamic political intolerance and fanaticism not in Islam, but in the generally low level of awareness of Islam&#x27;s own mechanisms for dealing with these, among modern believers, in part a result of Islam being suppressed prior to modern times.

<text>Pietro Vichi &quot;Pete&quot; Domenici ( ; May 7, 1932 – September 13, 2017) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States Senator from New Mexico from 1973 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, he served six terms in the Senate, making him the longest-tenured U.S. Senator in the state&#x27;s history. To date, Domenici is the last Republican to be elected to the Senate from New Mexico. He was succeeded by Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Udall.

During Domenici&#x27;s tenure in the Senate, he advocated waterway usage fees, nuclear power and related causes. He received criticism for his environmental record and extramarital affair. Domenici chaired several key committees including the Senate Budget Committee and Senate Energy Committee.

==Early years==
Domenici was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Alda (née Vichi) and Cherubino Domenici, both of whom were born in Modena, Italy.

Growing up, Domenici worked in his father&#x27;s grocery business after school. In 1950, he graduated from St. Mary&#x27;s High School in Albuquerque. He spent two years at the College of St. Joseph on the Rio Grande before earning a degree in education at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque in 1954, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

After graduating, Domenici pitched one season for the Albuquerque Dukes, then a Class C Minor league baseball team. He also taught mathematics at Garfield Junior High in Albuquerque. Domenici earned his law degree at the University of Denver law school in 1958 and returned to practice law in Albuquerque.

==Political career==
In 1966, Domenici successfully ran for a position on the Albuquerque City Commission and in 1968 was elected Commission Chairman (a post equivalent to that of mayor).

Domenici was the Republican nominee for governor in the 1970 New Mexico gubernatorial race, which he lost to Democrat and former state House Speaker Bruce King. King won the election with 148,835 votes (51 percent) to Domenici&#x27;s 134,640 (46 percent).

===Senate career===
In 1972, Domenici successfully ran for a position in the U.S. Senate and became the first New Mexico Republican to be elected to the position in 38 years. He was aided by Richard Nixon&#x27;s landslide win over Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern at the top of the ticket. Domenici polled 204,253 votes (54 percent) to 173,815 (46 percent) for Democratic state Representative Jack Daniels, a Hobbs realtor.

Domenici was subsequently re-elected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2002 and is to date the longest-serving senator in his state&#x27;s history, having served in the legislative body for 36 years. At the time of his retirement, he was the ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development. He was also a member of the U.S. Senate Committees on Appropriations and Indian Affairs, and served as Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Budget Committee. He advocated for the mentally ill, having pushed the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.

Domenici voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Domenici voted in favor of the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 1998, Domenici voted to convict President Bill Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice during his impeachment trial. He explained his vote: 

This was despite Domenici’s own adulterous affair at age 55 with 24-year-old Michelle Laxalt, daughter of his Senate colleague, Paul Laxalt. The affair, resulting in the birth of a son, would remain secret for decades.

====Water fees====
One of the first issues that Domenici concerned himself with was waterway usage fees, in spite of his state lacking any waterway capable of commercial traffic - although it did have a prominent railway industry. The idea behind a waterway usage fee was that the Army Corps of Engineers built dams and other expensive waterway projects, which the barge industry was able to use for free. In 1977, Domenici set himself to the task of enacting a waterway usage fee. After a long two-year battle with stiff lobbying on both sides, the waterway fee was finally passed along with a new lock and dam project (the rebuilding of Lock and Dam 26 at Alton, Illinois). Reporters attributed the passage of this fee in no small part to Domenici&#x27;s legislative skill. The legislation was signed into law in 1978.

The issue greatly assisted Domenici in his home state, where the railroad industry was a significant player (railroads competed with barges, and they had long wanted to end the &quot;free ride&quot; issue). The railroads donated $40,000 to Domenici&#x27;s campaign, and the barge industry gave a small sum to his opponent. He was reelected in 1978 with 53.4% of the vote over Democratic nominee Toney Anaya, a former New Mexico Attorney General who later became Governor. The 6.8% victory margin would be Domenici&#x27;s closest election in his Senate career.

====Environmental record====

The organization Republicans for Environmental Protection singled out Domenici as &quot;Worst in the Senate in 2006&quot; on environmental issues. In addition to assigning Domenici a score of zero for his environmental voting record, the group issued him &quot;environmental harm demerits&quot; for what they saw as two particularly irresponsible acts: first, for spearheading efforts to include in federal budget legislation provisions for &quot;speculative revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; second, &quot;for sponsoring and securing passage of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which would perpetuate America&#x27;s dangerous oil dependence, set a precedent for drilling in sensitive marine waters, and direct a disproportionate share of federal royalty revenues from a public resource to four states.&quot;
Domenici also received an exceptionally low environmental rating from the League of Conservation Voters, who claimed in 2003 that &quot;[d]uring the last decade his voting record has become even more strikingly anti-environmental.&quot; The LCV went on to criticize Domenici for voting in 1995 &quot;to allow mining companies to &#x27;patent&#x27; (purchase) public lands in order to extract minerals from them, without environmental standards, for the ridiculously low &#x27;price&#x27; of $5 an acre or less.&quot;

====Nuclear power====
Domenici was an avid proponent of nuclear power and published two books on the subject: &quot;A Brighter Tomorrow: Fulfilling the Promise of Nuclear Energy&quot; (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2004), which he wrote; and &quot;Advanced Nuclear Technologies — Hearing Before the Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate&quot; (Collingdale, Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Company, 1999), which he edited.

===Department of Justice controversy===
Prior to the 2006 midterm election Domenici called and allegedly pressured then-United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico David Iglesias to speed up indictments in a federal corruption investigation that involved at least one former Democratic state senator. When Iglesias said an indictment would not be handed down until at least December, Domenici said &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry to hear that&quot; — and the line went dead. Domenici&#x27;s telephone manners were the subject of a later article in &quot;The Albuquerque Journal&quot;, which quoted numerous other sources whom Domenici had treated rudely by hanging up after making a point or receiving an unsatisfactory answer. Iglesias was fired a little over one month later by the Bush Administration. In a March 2007 statement, Domenici admitted making such a call. House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., issued subpoenas to require Iglesias and three other ousted U.S. attorneys to testify before Congress.

Domenici later admitted calling Iglesias, though Domenici claimed he never used the word &quot;November&quot; when he called Iglesias about an ongoing Albuquerque courthouse corruption case. Domenici denied trying to influence Iglesias, and hired lawyer K. Lee Blalack II to represent him.

According to the Justice Department, Domenici called the Department and demanded Iglesias be replaced on four occasions.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, on the day of the firing (December 7, 2006) William Kelley, a deputy to then White House Counsel Harriet Miers, said in an email that Domenici&#x27;s chief of staff was &quot;happy as a clam&quot; about the Iglesias firing. A week later, a Justice Department email to the White House counsel stated: &quot;Domenici is going to send over names tomorrow (not even waiting for Iglesias&#x27;s body to cool).&quot;

On April 24, 2008, Domenici was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee for &quot;inappropriately&quot; contacting in 2006 one of the nine U.S. attorneys later fired by President Bush.

The committee found &quot;no substantial evidence&quot; that Domenici tried to influence attorney David Iglesias when he contacted him to inquire about the status of a 2006 investigation into corruption charges on a state Democratic official. A possible indictment could have buoyed the re-election hopes of Rep. Heather Wilson (R-N.M.), who was seeking to replace Domenici when the senator retired. Iglesias charged that Domenici and Wilson were pressuring him to wrap up the investigation before that November&#x27;s elections, a violation of ethics rules. The Ethics Committee said that Domenici&#x27;s phone call to Iglesias, in advance of an upcoming election, &quot;created an appearance of impropriety that reflected unfavorably on the Senate&quot;.

In July 2010, Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was not criminal, saying &quot;Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias. The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias.&quot; Domenici said of the closed investigation, &quot;The Justice Department has now confirmed what I have always said and believed: I never attempted to interfere with any government investigation. I am glad that this matter has concluded.&quot;

==Electoral history==








 









==Life after politics==
On October 4, 2007, Domenici announced his decision not to seek re-election to the Senate in 2008 for health reasons (specifically, frontotemporal lobar degeneration). His seat was won by Democrat Tom Udall.

After leaving the Senate, Domenici served as a senior fellow for the Bipartisan Policy Center. Domenici and former OMB director and CBO director Dr. Alice Rivlin chaired a Debt Reduction Task Force sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center. The task force was announced at a joint press conference on January 26, 2010, in Washington. The task force began its work in February 2010 and, led by Domenici, released a report on November 17, 2010 on ways to address and reduce the national debt and deficit.

The Domenici Institute, which aims to continue &quot;Domenici&#x27;s legacy of service to the state of New Mexico&quot;, bears his name.

==Personal life==
After graduating from law school in 1958, Domenici married Nancy Burk. Together, the Domenicis had two sons and six daughters (Lisa, Peter, Nella, Clare, David, Nanette, and twins Paula and Helen). One of his daughters has schizophrenia; this reportedly influenced his decision to become a strong supporter of legislation providing for parity in insurance coverage for mental illness. Helen ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2018 as a Republican nominee in District 19, but did not win the general election. Nella, a hedge fund manager, was the Republican Party nominee in the 2024 United States Senate election in New Mexico.

During the 1970s, Domenici fathered a child, Adam Laxalt, with Michelle Laxalt (1954–2023), a young Republican staffer and lobbyist and the daughter of Domenici&#x27;s then-Senate colleague, Nevada Republican Paul Laxalt; this fact was kept secret until 2013. In 2013, Domenici, then 80, acknowledged the affair and his son, saying he was &quot;very sorry&quot; for his behavior. Adam Laxalt ran for Attorney General of Nevada in the 2014 election and defeated Democrat Ross Miller. Laxalt was the Republican nominee for Governor of Nevada in the 2018 election, losing to Steve Sisolak, and the Republican nominee for Senator in the 2022 midterms, losing to Catherine Cortez Masto.

===Death===
Domenici died on September 13, 2017, at the age of 85, at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, from complications that resulted from abdominal surgery. His funeral was held on the morning of September 16 in Albuquerque.

<doc id="321181" wikidata="Q450626" url="?curid=321181" title="Couch potato">
<text>A couch potato is a person who spends most of his or her free time sitting or lying on a couch. This stereotype often refers to a lazy and overweight person who watches a great deal of television. Generally speaking, the term refers to a lifestyle in which children or adults don&#x27;t get enough physical activity.

==History==
The actual term &quot;couch potato&quot; was first coined in 1976 by Tom Iacino, a friend of American underground comics artist Robert Armstrong. In the early-1980s, he registered the term as a trademark with the United States government; he also co-authored a book with Jack Mingo, called &quot;The Official Couch Potato Handbook&quot;, which delves into the lives of couch potatoes.

The term eventually entered common American vocabulary, generally defining one who unceasingly watches television. The phrase was entered into the Oxford English Dictionary in 1993.

==Health==
Some studies have said that the &quot;couch potato lifestyle&quot; is a serious health hazard to its practitioners; in the United Kingdom, a plan of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Strategy Unit tried attempts &quot;to combat the couch potato culture&quot; to &quot;[improving the U.K.&#x27;s] international sporting performance.&quot;

Studies presented at the 2003 meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine suggested that there could be a genetic basis for the &quot;couch potato lifestyle&quot;.

Research suggests that being a couch potato could make a person a decade older biologically than someone who is physically active.

==Popular culture==
* Various activities have been designed for the couch potato, including a type of investment portfolio (&quot;Couch Potato Portfolio&quot;) and fantasy football leagues.
* Greyhound dogs, who are well-known for their sprinting ability but otherwise require little exercise, are sometimes called &quot;forty-five mile per hour couch potatoes&quot; by adoption and rescue agencies.
* Music artist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Couch Potato&quot; (a parody of &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem) describes him watching hours upon hours of television, &quot;until [his] legs are numb, [his] eyes bloodshot.&quot; 
* The phrase has coined the spin-off &quot;mouse potato&quot; (or sometimes &quot;computer potato&quot;), meaning one who spends too much time in front of a computer.
* In the comedy movie &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; (1992), Roy Knable (John Ritter) was a couch potato who was sucked into a television world by an emissary from hell (Jeffrey Jones).
* &quot;Couch Potatoes&quot; was the name of a game show hosted by &quot;Double Dare&quot; host Marc Summers.
* &quot;Couch Potato&quot; was a Sunday morning kids TV show aired on the ABC in Australia in the 1990s.

<text>Wright Aeronautical (1919–1929) was an American aircraft manufacturer headquartered in Paterson, New Jersey. It was the successor corporation to Wright-Martin. It built aircraft and was a supplier of aircraft engines to other builders in the golden age of aviation. Wright engines were used by Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh. In 1929, the company merged with Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Corporation to form Curtiss-Wright.

==History==
In 1916, the Wright brothers&#x27; original aviation firm, the Wright Company, merged with Glenn L. Martin&#x27;s firm, the Glenn L. Martin Company of California, to form the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation. In September 1917, Martin resigned from Wright-Martin and re-formed an independent Glenn L. Martin Company of Ohio (later of Maryland). After World War I in 1919, Wright-Martin was renamed Wright Aeronautical. It moved to Paterson, New Jersey in 1919.

In February 1919, an airplane with a Wright engine broke the world&#x27;s speed record at 163⅔ miles per hour. In November 1920, an airplane with a 300-horsepower Wright engine came in second place in the first Pulitzer Trophy Race in Long Island, New York. Other planes using Wright engines came in fourth and fifth place in the race.

In 1920, Wright produced a canon engine for the Army that allowed shells to be fired through the airplane&#x27;s propeller. In 1921, a 300 horsepower engine by Wright again came in second place at the Pulitzer Trophy Race in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1921, Wright developed a new six-cylinder dirigible engine with 400 horsepower, testing it for nine months. In 1922, a plane with a Wright H-2 engine won the Mitchell Trophy Race.

In May 1923, Wright Aeronautical purchased the Lawrance Aero Engine Company, acquiring Charles Lawrance&#x27;s J-1 radial engine. Lawrance became a vice president of Wright. In 1925, Wright&#x27;s president, Frederick B. Rentschler, left the company to found Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Company; Lawrance replaced him as company president. Rentschler poached several talented personnel from Wright to join his new firm.

Working off Lawrance&#x27;s designs, Wright Aeronautical developed an air-cooled engine, the Model J Whirlwind series. In 1925, a Wright-Bellanca airplane won the Pulitzer Trophy Race using a Wright Whirlwind engine. In 1927, a Wright J-5C Whirlwind engine was used by Charles Lindbergh in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; when he flew from New York City to Paris. Wright engines were also used by other famed aviators, including Richard E. Byrd, Clarence Chamberlin, and Amelia Earhart.

Wright Aeronautical merged with the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company on July 5, 1929, to become the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. Their engine divisions merged in 1931.

During World War II, the Paterson plant had 24,000 employees, working in three daily shifts. They made some 75,000 engines for the B-25, the Boeing B-17, and other aircraft. Wright also made engines for 44 commercial airlines and rocket engines for space travel. However, the Paterson plant closed in 1946.

<text>Tlacotalpan is a city in Tlacotalpan Municipality in the Mexican state of Veracruz, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998 primarily for its architecture and colonial-era layout. The town was established in 1550 on what was originally an island in the Papaloapan River. From the colonial era to the 20th century, it was an important port, one of few interior river ports in Latin America. However, with the construction of the railroad, Tlacotalpan&#x27;s importance faded. Starting in the latter 20th century, efforts to conserve the city&#x27;s Spanish/Caribbean architecture and layout began, culminating in World Heritage status. Today, its main economic support is fishing and tourism, especially to the annual feast in honor of Our Lady of Candlemas.

== The town ==
It is nicknamed the &quot;pearl of the Papaloapan.&quot;

Tlacotalpan is distinct among most urban settlements in Latin America as it is a river port set back from the ocean. It is a World Heritage Site because of its layout, architecture, history and traditions. The urban layout and architecture date back to the 17th century, and the town has mostly conserved both. The layout is a checkboard, covering 153 blocks on 75 hectares. This is divided into two sections: a &quot;Spanish&quot; section in the west and a smaller &quot;native&quot; one in the east, separated by a public area with commercial and official buildings along with some public spaces. The Spanish section of town is characterized by wide streets that parallel the Papaloapan River and connected by narrow lanes. Through this area, there are parks, and public spaces with mature trees, such as the Parque Hidalgo, noted for wandering musicians and Plazuela de Doña Maria, just east of the center, in the oldest section of town, surrounded by workshops that make furniture, musical instruments and other fine wood products. The architecture is characterized by one and two-story colonnaded houses Andalucian style inner courtyards, Caribbean-style arches, red-tile roofs and colorful facades, some of which date to the 18th century. These are particularly abundant in the San Miguelito and La Candelaria neighborhoods. Many of the houses still retain their interior layout and even traditional furnishings.

Although past its heyday in the 19th century, Tlacotalpan is still classified as a river port by the Mexican government, mostly serving fishing boats and small naval patrols. It has a 160-meter-long cement dock, and a boardwalk along the river, much of it lined with restaurants.

Set back slightly from the riverfront is the main square, called Plaza Zaragoza. It is laid out in white marble and dotted with palm trees. In the center, there is a 19th-century kiosk designed by local sculptor Francisco Sanchez Terán.

The main landmark along this plaza is the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Candlemas (Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria) on the north side. This church was built in the late 18th century (starting 1770) under Juan de Medina using stone brought from reefs in the Gulf of Mexico to house the Virgin Mary image inside, brought by sailors to the town in the 17th century. The city&#x27;s main annual celebration fills this church with candles and flowers.

The other church along the plaza is the San Cristóbal Parish, which dates from 1849. It is Neoclassical with some Moorish influence, which a clock in its tower said to have come from England over two centuries ago. Its main altarpieces inside is sculpted from wood and contains a notable image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. There is also in important altar dedicated to Jesus in the side chapel next to the main altar area.

However, neither the sanctuary nor the parish is the oldest standing church in the town. This is the San Miguelito Church, located at the Plaza de las Madres. It was constructed in 1785 during the height of Baroque in Mexico.

The last main structure at Plaza Zaragoza is the municipal palace. It was constructed in 1849 and contains various oil paintings by Salvador Ferrando as well as an archive of documents that date back to the colonial period.

Just east of the Sanctuary is a small plaza called the Plazuela Agustín Lara, named for a statue here of the songwriter. The Casa Artesanal Rafaela Murillo de Barbero is on the south side of this plaza, which used to be the municipal jail. Today it contains finely embroidered dresses, blouses, men&#x27;s traditional suits and wood furniture and other products. The Salvador Ferrando Museum is located on the east side, dedicated to a painter and pioneer in the preservation of Veracruz&#x27;s cultural heritage, in a house that belonged to him. The museum contains works by the artist and others along with antiques from his time period.

The Agustín Lara House Museum is located on Gonzalo Aguirre Beltrán Street east of the main plaza and is one of the most active cultural centers. It is dedicated to the songwriter and poet who lived much of his life in the town. It contains photographs and objects related to Lara and his career along with some of other important area artists such as Salvador Ferrando, Alberto Fuster and the more contemporary Eric Arana. Another landmark linked to Lara&#x27;s life is the Blanca Nieves Cantina, also known as the Museum Bar of Tobías Carbajal Rivera. It was a favorite hangout of the songwriter, where he drank the local alcoholic beverage called “toritos” with friends. It has been in business for over sixty years, but originally called El Encango de Tobías. Its current name, &quot;Snow White&quot; in Spanish, comes from Lara himself, as a tribute to then-owner Tobías Carbajal and his seven children. The museum section of the bar contain the only statue of Lara depicted in a guayabera and palm fond hat.

The town&#x27;s cultural center is also named after Lara (Casa de Cultura Agustín Lara). Located on Venustiano Carranza Avenue, its serves as a meeting place for artists, musicians and dancers, offering classes in traditional Veracruz zapateado dance and various instruments. It also has a permanent exhibition of items related to Lara, along with paintings by Salvador Ferrando and Alberto Fuster.

The Nezahuacoyotl Theater is also on Venustiano Carranza, constructed in 1891 in French style during the Porfirio Díaz period.

One other house converted into an attraction is the “mini zoo.” The structure and collection belonged to Pío Barrán. It houses a collection of objects and animals, especially from the making of movies that Barrán collected over his lifetime, including a notable collection related to Agustín Lara. The most unusual aspect of the site is the collection of exotic animals, a number of which run free on the property. The collection includes crocodiles, turtles, pelicans and birds of prey.

The Jardín del Arte Tlacotalpeño (Tlacotalpan Art Garden) exhibits and sells works by artists in the region. It is located just south of the main square.

== The Music ==

In the intense festive calendar of Mexico, the celebration of the Virgen de la Candelaria in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz, is a must. From January 31 to February 2, thousands of people crowd the streets of this beautiful place. During this festival, most Tlacotalpeños open their houses to accommodate thousands of visitors. During the days of the fair, the XXXVI National Meeting of Jaraneros and Versadores will be held in Plaza Doña Martha from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. 56 groups are considered in the program, each one will have a participation of 10 to 30 minutes. Every night, ending this Encounter, the fandango will begin in the same square. There will also be fandangos in front of the church of San Miguel Arcángel better known as San Miguelito. These forums are coordinated by Diego López Vergara from the Siquisiri group.

== Geography and environment ==
Tlacotalpan is located in the center of the eastern Mexico state of Veracruz, about 90 km from the port of Veracruz and 203 km southeast of the capital, Xalapa. It is part of the Sotavento region of the state.

The geography of the area is somewhat flat, with rolling foothills towards the west. Most of the territory (60%) is used for livestock grazing, with about 15% under cultivation and 20% covered by water.

The territory is defined by the Papaloapan River, along with the San Juan and Tuxpan Rivers which are both tributaries of the first. The Papaloapan is navigable, but there is neither dredging or signaling for boat traffic.

The area has a semi-tropical climate, with an average annual temperatureof 25.1C. There are two distinct seasons. From October to April, the weather is dominated by the passing of cold fronts from the north, called &quot;nortes.&quot; These fronts can cause strong winds and tornados. During the rest of the year, the weather is dominated by the Atlantic Current (Corriente Atlántica), which are warm and humid winds coming from the southeast of Mexico, causing most of the area&#x27;s annual rainfall. September is the stormiest month and the area is also affected regularly by hurricanes. These can cause severe flooding such as the case of Hurricane Roxanne in 1995, Hurricanes Dean and Felix in 1997, Hurricane Karl in 2010 and Hurricane Ernesto in 2012.

The vegetation is deciduous, with main tree species being holm oak, ash (Fraxinus), willow and poplar. There are also areas with mangroves.

The area has some oil deposits.
== History ==

The name &quot;Tlacotalpan&quot; is a Spanish modification of the Nahuatl &quot;Tlaxcotaliapan&quot; which means &quot;land between the waters.&quot; This refers to the island of the original settlement in the Papaloapan River. When the north bank of the river was modified, the island was adjoined to the mainland. In the mid-19th century, the name was San Cristobal Tlacotalpan, but has since been shortened.

Much is not known about the pre Hispanic history of the area, but the area was originally inhabited by the Totonacs. These were later displaced by the Toltecs in the 12th century. In 1461, Moctezuma Ilhuicamina began the Aztec&#x27;s first efforts to expand here, then controlled by the Cotaxtlan dominion. In 1475, Axayacatl conquered it along with Coixtlahuaca, Tochtepec and Cosamaloapan, giving all these areas their current names.

In 1518, Pedro de Alvarado led an expedition sailing up the Papaloapan area and in 1521, Hernán Cortés sent Gonzalo de Sandoval here to search for gold. After the Conquest in 1521, Alfonso Romero received the area as an encomienda. In the current municipality, in a place then called Coanapa-Ayotzinapa, Cortés set up the first sugar cane mill in Mexico in 1532. In 1550, it was granted by the Spanish king to Gaspar Rivakeneyra on which he kept livestock. He could not prevent fishermen from establishing the town but he required them to build a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Candlemas.

Colonization of the area was slow with only twelve Spaniards in 1544 and no more than 320 by 1777. Figures on other populations during the colonial period are missing but in 1808 there were 1,156 indigenous inhabitants and 1,616 &quot;pardos&quot; or people of indigenous and African heritage.

At the beginning of the 17th century, there was an attempt to subordinate the area to Cosamaloapan, but the indigenous population here resisted it successfully. In the 17th century, it became a commercial center for surrounding haciendas, which led to growth in its Spanish population. Its wealth and status as a port attracted English pirates in the 17th and 18th centuries and the city was burned down once by them in 1667.

In 1714, the Papaloapan flooded and forced the movement of the city to its current location, then called Chuniapa. The town suffered three other major fires in 1698, 1788 and 1790. The last two prompted authorities to require rebuilding with stone walls, tile roofs and the establishment of open spaces with trees. Those who could not rebuild in this fashion were forced to move to the eastern part of the town which had more relaxed requirements. Most of the oldest buildings date from this time and determined the common style of large houses with courtyards, tile roofs and arched passages.

The municipality&#x27;s territory was fixed by the end of the 18th century.

Tlacotalpan reached its height as a port city in the 19th century. At the beginning of this century, French, German and Italian immigrants came to the area to plant and weave cotton, to be sold in English markets. Starting in 1821, Tlacotalpan experienced economic grown as a port for products from Oaxaca and Puebla going to Veracruz and abroad to New Orleans, Havana and Bordeaux. By 1855 it was home to eighteen steamships and a large sailing ship which transported timber, tobacco, cotton, grain, sugar, brandy, leather, salted meat, crocodiles, heron feathers, furniture and soap. In 1825 one of Mexico&#x27;s first nautical colleges was opened, founded by Guadalupe Victoria. In 1847, Tlacotalpan was officially declared a town in recognition of its participation in the defense against U.S. forces in the Mexican–American War. In 1864 the town was taken by French forces under Marechal one day after taking Alvarado. Later that same year, Republican forces under Alejandro García retook the area. In 1865 it was declared a city and provisional capital for its resistance against the French. In 1879, Miguel Z. Cházaro founded Veracruz&#x27;s third preparatory school. Here Porfirio Díaz organized an uprising against the government of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, which led to a name change of Tlacotalpan de Porfirio Díaz in 1896. This was changed to the current version after the Mexican Revolution. At the beginning of the 20th century, the town had eight schools, three hotels, nine factories and 100 single-storied houses.

However, in the first part of the 20th century, Tlacotalpan&#x27;s importance as a port, which had sustained it since the colonial period, waned with the construction of the Ferrocarril del Istmo railroad. Its population grew only slightly from 1950 to 1980 and has remained stable since then at a bit over 8,800.

In 1968, conservation efforts began when Tlacotalpan was declared a &quot;typical city&quot; of Mexico by the state of Veracruz. In 1986 it was declared a Historic Monuments Zone by the federal government to be managed by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH) and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA). In 1985 and 1997 a transition zone was established which includes areas across the river which serves as a buffer to the main conservation area. In 1998, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its history as a river port, its architecture and its traditions in poetry, music and dance.

Since these declarations INAH and the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Arts (FONCA) have worked to revitalize the city and improve the economy, particularly through tourism.

<doc id="321190" wikidata="Q3231737" url="?curid=321190" title="Megan's Law">
<text>Megan&#x27;s Law is the name for a federal law (and informal name for subsequent state laws) in the United States requiring law enforcement authorities to make information available to the public regarding registered sex offenders. Laws were created in response to the murder of Megan Kanka, who was raped and murdered by her neighbour, Jesse Timmendequas, who was a previously-convicted child sex offender. Federal Megan&#x27;s Law was enacted as a subsection of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act of 1994, which merely required sex offenders to register with local law enforcement. Because only a few states required registration prior to Megan&#x27;s death, the state-level legislation to bring states in compliance—with both the &quot;registration&quot; requirement of Jacob Wetterling Act and &quot;community notification&quot; required by federal Megan&#x27;s Law—were crafted simultaneously and are often referred to as &quot;Megan&#x27;s Laws&quot; of individual states. Thus, the federal Megan&#x27;s Law refers to &quot;community notification&quot; (making registry information public), whereas state-level &quot;Megan&#x27;s Law&quot; may refer to both &quot;sex offender registration&quot; and &quot;community notification&quot;.

Individual states decide what information will be made available and how it should be disseminated. For example, they disseminate the information via social media platforms such as Facebook. Commonly included information is the offender&#x27;s name, picture, address, incarceration date, and offense of conviction. The information is often displayed on free public websites, but can be published in newspapers, distributed in pamphlets, or through various other means.

At the federal level, Megan&#x27;s Law requires persons convicted of sex crimes against children to notify local law enforcement of any change of address or employment after release from custody (prison or psychiatric facility). The notification requirement may be imposed for a fixed period of time—usually at least ten years—or permanently. Some states may legislate registration for all sex crimes, even if no minors were involved. It is a felony in most jurisdictions to fail to register or fail to update information.

Together, the Wetterling Act and Megan&#x27;s Law provide two major information services: sex offender registry for law enforcement, and community notification for the public. The details of what is provided as part of sex offender registration and how community notification is handled vary from state to state, and in some states the required registration information and community notification protocols have changed many times since Megan&#x27;s Law was passed. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act supplements Megan&#x27;s Law with new registration requirements and a three-tier system for classifying sex offenders according to certain listed offenses requiring registration.

==History==
Before Megan&#x27;s Law, the federal Jacob Wetterling Act of 1994 required each state to create a registry for sexual offenders and certain other offenses against children. Under the Wetterling Act, registry information was kept for law enforcement use only, although law enforcement agencies were allowed to release the information of specific persons when deemed necessary to protect the public. After the high-profile rape and murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey by Jesse Timmendequas, a sex offender with two previous convictions of sex crimes against small children who resided across the street from Megan, her parents Richard and Maureen Kanka worked to change the law by demanding mandatory community notification of sex offenders, arguing that the registration required under the Jacob Wetterling Act was not a sufficient protection measure. They said that Megan would still be alive had they known of the criminal history of Timmendequas. Paul Kramer sponsored a package of seven bills known as Megan&#x27;s Law in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1994. 89 days after Megan was murdered, New Jersey enacted Megan&#x27;s Law, which required sex offender registration, with a database tracked by the state, and whereabouts of &quot;high-risk sex offenders&quot; moving into a neighborhood to be made public. Before Megan&#x27;s death, only five states required sex offenders to register with local law enforcement as required in Jacob Wetterling Act.

The New Jersey law became model for federal legislation, introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Dick Zimmer. On May 17, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed federal Megan&#x27;s Law, an amendment to the Jacob Wetterling Act, that set the guidelines for the state statutes, requiring states to notify the public, although officials could decide how much public notification is necessary, based on the level of danger posed by an offender.

===International Megan&#x27;s Law===

International Megan&#x27;s Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes Through Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders was signed into a law by President Obama on February 8, 2016. International Megan&#x27;s Law requires the notification to foreign governments when a citizen of the United States who is registered as a sex offender for sexual offense involving a minor is going to be traveling to their country. The law requires a visual &quot;unique identifier&quot; to be placed on the passports of covered registrants and requires offenders to notify law enforcement 21 days before traveling abroad. The law was challenged shortly after being enacted.

==Public notification==
States differ with respect to public disclosure of offenders. In some states all sex offenders are subject to public notification through Megan&#x27;s Law websites. However, in others, only information on high-risk offenders is publicly available, and the complete lists are withheld for law enforcement only. Under federal SORNA &quot;tier I&quot; registrants may be excluded from public disclosure, with exemption of those convicted of &quot;specified offense against a minor.&quot; Since SORNA merely sets the minimum standards the states must follow, many SORNA compliant states disclose information of all tiers. These disparities have prompted some registrants to move into states with less strict rules.

==Criticism==
Evidence to support the effectiveness of public sex offender registries is limited and mixed. Majority of research results do not find statistically significant shift in sexual offense trends following the implementation of sex offender registration and notification (SORN) regimes. A few studies indicate that sexual recidivism may have been lowered by SORN policies, while a few have found statistically significant increase in sex crimes following SORN implementation. According to the Office of Justice Programs&#x27; SMART Office, sex offender registration and notification requirements arguably have been implemented in the absence of empirical evidence regarding their effectiveness.

Opponents of Megan&#x27;s Law, like Women Against Registry, National Association for Rational Sexual Offense Laws, and Human Rights Watch, have called the law overbroad and an invitation to vigilante violence.

Treatment professionals such as ATSA criticize the lack of evidence of the laws&#x27; effectiveness, the automatic inclusion of offenders on the registry without determining the risk of re-offense (by applying scientifically validated risk assessment tools), the scientifically unsupported popular belief in high recidivism, and the counter-effectiveness of the laws, which can actually undermine, rather than improve public safety by exacerbating factors (e.g. unemployment, instability) that may lead to recidivism. In addition, civil rights and reformist organizations highlight the adverse collateral effects on the family members of registrants, and question the fairness of the registries as indefinite punishment, and when applied to certain offender groups, such as juveniles and young adults engaging in consensual acts. Some victims&#x27; rights advocates like Patty Wetterling have presented similar critique.

<doc id="321195" wikidata="Q3039803" url="?curid=321195" title="Local law in Alsace–Moselle">
<text>The territory of the former Alsace–Lorraine, legally known as Alsace–Moselle, is a region in the eastern part of France, bordering with Germany. Its principal cities are Metz and Strasbourg. Alsace-Moselle was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918, and was subsequently reoccupied by Germany from 1940 until its recapture by the Allies at the end of World War II. Consisting of the two departments that make up the region of Alsace, which are Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin, and the department of Moselle, which is the northeastern part of Lorraine, there are historical reasons for the continuance of local law in Alsace-Moselle. Alsace–Moselle maintains its own local legislation, applying specific customs and laws on certain issues in spite of its being an integral part of France. These laws are principally in areas that France addressed by changing its own law in the period 1871–1919, when Alsace-Moselle was a part of Germany.

Alsace-Moselle has many speakers of a form of High German known as Alsatian, an Alemannic dialect of Upper German. Its native speakers are mostly in Alsace. Several Franconian dialects of West Middle German are also spoken in the district of Moselle, although their number of native speakers has dwindled significantly since the Second World War and the French language is now overwhelmingly heard in these districts. The region&#x27;s German-language past is now, at the beginning of the 21st century, mostly evident in the names of towns, streets, villages and rivers.

==Principles==
The local law () in Alsace-Moselle is a legal system that operates in parallel with French law. It preserves those statutes made by the German authorities during annexation that were considered still to be beneficial in these territories following their return to France. Created in 1919, the local law preserves some French laws that were in force before 1870 and were maintained by the German government but were repealed after 1871 in France. It also maintains some German laws enacted by the German Empire between 1871 and 1918, some specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and some French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in the three concerned departments.

In 1919, a Commissioner of the Republic (&quot;), whose duty was to restart the French administration in Alsace-Moselle following German defeat in World War I, had to choose between local law and general law. These provisions were supposed to be temporary. However, two further enactments of 1 June 1924 made them permanent. These laws were extended six times between 1934 and 1951. The 1951 legislation did not have a time limit. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, the German language text for some laws in force in Alsace-Moselle is considered the binding one, the translated French text serving only as a non-binding commentary.

==Religion==

Perhaps the most striking of the legal differences between interior France and Alsace-Moselle is the absence in Alsace-Moselle of a separation of church and state (cf. 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State), even though a constitutional right of freedom of religion is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Moselle is still governed by a pre-1905 French law established by the Concordat of 1801 which provides for the public subsidy to the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Metz and of Strasbourg, the Lutheran Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine, the Calvinist Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine and the Jewish religion of the three local Israelite consistorial ambits of Colmar, Metz, and Strasbourg, as well as providing for public education in these faiths; although parents are now allowed to refuse religious education for their children. The clergy for these religions are on the state&#x27;s payroll. Catholic bishops are named by the President of the French Republic following a proposal by the Pope. The heads of the Lutheran and Calvinist churches are appointed by the prime minister, after being elected by the competent religious bodies. The public University of Strasbourg has courses in theology and is famous for its teaching of Protestant theology.

This situation is unusual in a country like France where church and state are more strictly separated than in most other nations. There is debate over whether the second largest religion in France, Islam, should enjoy comparable status with the four official religions.

==Some specific provisions==
In the area of work and finance, specific provisions have been made in local law for a local social security system, including additional, compulsory insurance and regulations governing remuneration during a short sickness absence. There are differences with French law also in the areas of personal bankruptcy, voluntary associations and in local work law (&quot;). Working is generally prohibited on Sundays and public holidays. Alsace-Moselle has two more public holidays (Good Friday and 26 December) than the rest of France and there are differences in the status of some crafts and trades, for example, winemakers and brewers.

Communes have to provide aid to resourceless people and they generally have more power than in the rest of France. They manage hunting rights, which are sold by auction for nine years at a time; land owners are not the owners of the game and cannot forbid hunting on their land although the hunters are responsible for game&#x27;s damage.

During political elections, most election literature is written bilingually in both French and German. The land book (&quot;&quot;) is not held by the tax directorate but by a court service. Trains run on the right of the double tracks, as they did under the administration of the Imperial Railways in Alsace–Lorraine and still do in Germany, whereas in the rest of France they normally run on the left.

Since the end of the 20th century, some of the local laws have been incorporated into general law, especially in the areas of social security, personal bankruptcy and social aid. Some others have been repealed, like the work law and the election literature, which meet now the French general law. A long unenforced law against blasphemy was also repealed in 2016. However, working on Sundays remains restricted .

<text>Aix-les-Bains (, ; ; ), known locally and simply as Aix, is a commune in the southeastern French department of Savoie.

Situated on the shore of the largest natural lake of glacial origin in France, the Lac du Bourget, this resort is a major spa town; it has the largest freshwater marina in France. It is the second largest city in the Savoie department in terms of population, with a population of 32,175 as of 2022. It is part of the Chambéry functional urban area.

A leading town of the Belle Époque, of international renown, Aix-les-Bains was a vacation destination for nobility and the wealthy. Although the thermal baths are no longer the main attraction in Aix, the area continues to draw visitors for water sports and activities. The town has partially compensated for the loss of visitors coming for spa treatments by developing tourism. It hosts up to 200,000 general visitors annually, between tourists and people seeking mineral bath therapy. It is also an industrial city, with a few large companies such as General Electric, the headquarters of the Léon Grosse companies, ABB Cellier, Aixam, as well as a high-quality leather goods factory.

In addition to thermal baths and tourism, Aix-les-Bains is known for its national Musilac festival. It has four flowers and two golden flowers at the Concours des villes et villages fleuris, as well as the City of Art and History label.

==Geography==
===Location===

Aix-les-Bains is located in the southeast of France, east of Lyon. The town is located in a corridor between the mountain of Mont Revard, the first natural rampart of the Massif des Bauges to the east and the Lac du Bourget, the largest natural lake of France to the west. Thus, the city extends mostly on a north–south axis. Its extension is such that its agglomeration merges gradually with that of Chambéry. The area of the commune is , which is large for the department. The town is traditionally divided into two, the lower town that occupies the banks of the lake to the west and the upper town, where the town centre is located, overlooking the Lac du Bourget. The town was first built on the heights in order to avoid the many floods of the lake until it was regulated by the dam of the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) between the Rhône and the natural spillway of lake, the Canal de Savières. The average altitude of the city is about while the lower part of it is only around , at the level of the lake.
 of the Lac du Bourget watershed is occupied by the spa town of Aix, which borders on the shore. The lake is primarily fed to the south by the waters of the Leysse, and to the east, by those of the and the , both from the Aix territory. Native fish can be admired in the aquarium of Aix. The shore, which is occupied by Aix and Tresserve, is highly urbanized and developed along the northeastern part with the road and the railway track. Many restaurants and nightclubs are located there (mostly on the southeastern side). A nautical complex was built on its shore, this includes a swimming pool and a beach which has an Art Deco-style main entrance dating from 1936. After which is a vast esplanade, allowing walkers to stroll and special events to settle temporarily on this site. It offers a panoramic view of the lake and the Dent du Chat, where birds such as mute swans, mallards, grey herons, black-headed gulls and common moorhens can be found.

The esplanade is bounded to the north and to the south by the &quot;Grand port&quot; and the &quot;Petit port&quot; respectively, thus constituting the Aix port which is the largest fresh water port in the country with 1,500 mooring rings, having privileged places for boating on the lake, with boats having a summer or annual allocation. The festival of yachting takes place each year. This event has old boats coming from all horizons, a professional market, demonstrations and shows.

The slopes above the lake that culminate in the Tour de l&#x27;Angle Est, which overlooks the town and lake at a height of . The western shore of the lake is narrower as the mountains along its edge are closer to the lakeshore, although lower than those on the eastern side. The lake drains out of its northern end into the River Rhône about to the north.

===Neighbouring communes===
The municipality of Aix-les-Bains is bordered by nine communes. To the north, the municipality adjoins the territory of Brison-Saint-Innocent. To the northeast, Aix is bordered by the commune of Grésy-sur-Aix. Then, to the east, in the continuity of the Aix heights, the commune of Pugny-Chatenod is followed by the commune of Mouxy towards the southeast. Further to the southeast, Aix shares the boundaries of its territory with the neighbouring commune of Drumettaz-Clarafond. It follows south to the communes of Viviers-du-Lac and Tresserve. Finally, in the west, there are two communes bordering Aix, across the lake. These are Bourdeau, La Chapelle-du-Mont-du-Chat. One of the specific limits of the municipal territory of the commune of Aix-les-Bains, on its western side, is the existence of the boundary imposed by the Lac du Bourget. This limit of the territory is shared with five other municipalities, these being Bourdeau, Brison-Saint-Innocent, La Chapelle-du-Mont-du-Chat, Tresserve and Viviers-du-Lac.

===Climate===
Aix-les-Bains, like Chambéry, has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with strong continental influences due to its position: far inland and near several mountain ranges, like the Jura mountains, Bauges and Bornes Massif.

===Communication and transport===

Aix-Les-Bains is located on the major transport axis between Chambéry and Annecy. The northern branch of the A41 motorway passes to the east of the town, allowing direct access to Annecy and then later, by the continuity of the A40, into the city of Geneva. Two junctions (13 and 14) serve the commune, one to the south, the other to the north. On the secondary network, the road crosses Aix and joins Viviers-du-Lac and Chambéry to the south. To the west, the road heads towards the south-west and the Lac du Bourget towards the commune of Le Bourget-du-Lac and, through the centre, the D991 road.

Aix-les-Bains is also accessible by train. It was one of the earliest European municipalities to host a rail network in its territory when it was administered by the Dukes of Savoie. Today, the city is connected to Chambéry and Annecy and Culoz. The Turin–Lyon high-speed railway will, in the coming years, bring together the cities of Paris, Lyon, Turin and Milan. Aix-les-Bains station has been a multimodal transport hub since 2007. Located to the west of the town centre on Boulevard de President Wilson, Aix-les-Bains-Le Revard railway station is served by the TGV, which puts the town within three hours of Paris. Aix is situated north of Chambéry, by rail.

Chambéry-Savoie Airport, formerly Aix-les-Bains/Chambéry, is located at the south of the town of Aix-les-Bains, in the commune of Voglans, a few metres from the south shore of the Lac du Bourget. It serves many countries including the UK (Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh), Denmark (Copenhagen, Billund), Sweden (Gothenburg) and, internally, Paris Orly from 2013. There are many winter flights due to the proximity of the winter sports resorts. Three low-cost carrier airlines offer regular flights. In 2002, the airport recorded a record attendance with 3,600 aircraft movements year-round, dealing with more than 10,000 passengers per weekend, mainly in winter.
In the town centre, the car is the most common mode of transport in Aix-les-Bains, despite the efforts made by the &quot;Association Roue Libre&quot; for the development of urban cycling. Traffic at peak hours is particularly difficult, especially in the summer with the influx of tourists. The portion of the D1201 road along the lake, in the direction of Chambéry, is particularly sensitive to this increase in road traffic. The same problem happens with the Rue de Genève, the Boulevard President Wilson and the Rue de Chambéry. To the north, it is similarly so on the way out of the town in the direction of Albens and Annecy on the Boulevard Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny. However, traffic has tended to improve with urban development promoting the emergence of roundabouts at the expense of the traffic light, allowing a better flow of traffic. In addition, in the town centre, two car parks can accommodate vehicles, although the number of parking spaces remains low in the town centre for shopping.

For travellers preferring public transport, two main bus routes and sixteen additional routes serve the metropolitan area. Two routes are also available to access the side of Mont Revard and the Chapel of the Mont du Chat. &quot;Ondea&quot; (trade name of the network operated by the company Keolis) was tasked by the to manage transit services. It employs 55 people. During the summer, the town is served for short trips by a small train travelling on the roads. It runs between the esplanade of the lake, the beach and town centre.

==Urbanism==
===Urban morphology===

The life of Aix-les-Bains is located largely on its heights where its downtown, the economic heart, and its thermal baths (the National Baths of Chevalley and the Baths of Marlioz) are located. Indeed, the history of the town has made it a spa town. Aix was organized around this activity, which was initiated by the Romans. The lower part of the town, located on the shores of the lake, was abandoned because of the risk of flooding. The land was cultivated and there were fish farms. The economic activity is mainly on the upper part, and the urban morphology has adapted. It had to take into account living space for services (racecourse, casino, thermal baths, deluxe hotels, station, hospital and golf, for instance) and the surrounding geography.

Aix-les-Bains includes grand boulevards which are the Robert Barrier Boulevard, Boulevard Lepic, Russia Boulevard/President Wilson Boulevard, the Boulevard of Dr. Jean Charcot/Boulevard Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt Boulevard. These boulevards are wide and open unlike the streets of downtown, which are narrower, and the other axes, which can be more constrained because of the proximity of the Massif des Bauges and its winding climbs, meeting the more anarchic requirements of the moment without taking the urban fabric into overall account. The town includes various neighborhoods such as Chantemerle, Boncelin, around the railway station, the Sierroz, la liberté, the lakeside, Marlioz, Lepic, Franklin Roosevelt and many others.

With urban expansion and population growth Aix-les-Bains constantly extends, similarly to the neighbouring communes. Little by little, one speaks beyond a city of Aix-les-Bains as such, but the Aix area encompassing an urban plan, with the nearby communes such as Tresserve, Grésy-sur-Aix, Mouxy, Méry, Drumettaz-Clarafond, Sonnaz, as well as other communes. This phenomenon also applies to Chambéry, which is located south of Aix-les-Bains and is considered as the Chambéry area. The urban morphology of these two local watersheds tends to draw them inexorably closer together. In order to reconcile the urban development of the Aix and Chambéry areas, the joint association of the has been implemented. The mission is to follow the pattern of territorial coherence (SCOT) of the Combe de Savoie, Chambéry and the Lac du Bourget.

===Housing===
Aix-les-Bains had 20,317 homes in 2017, of which 15,491 (76.2%) were main residences. 18% of the main residences were built before 1945, and 30% were built after 1990. 22.4% of all houses are detached houses and 76.4% are apartments. 52.7% of the main residences are owned by their occupants, 45.2% are occupied by tenants.

1,837 are HLM rent-controlled housing, or 15.7% of the area in 1999, the city did not meet the provisions of article 55 of the of December 2000, which laid down a 20% minimum rate of social housing in the most important municipalities. It further noted that the number of vacant dwellings was quite high in 1999, accounting for 11.4% of the area. The of the Savoie, with more than 1,657 social homes in the commune, manages the assets of about 2,500 homes, through its antenna Aix-les-Bains. This includes 1,600 of Aix-les-Bains, located in the Sierroz-Franklin neighbourhood among others. Homes with four rooms account for 46% of the overall housing stock, with three-roomed homes at 27.4%, and two rooms at 17.5%. Small housing accounts for about one-tenth of Aix housing (studios: 9.1%). These accommodations are well staffed and equipped, particularly because of the geographic location at the heart of the Alps, since 93.9% have central heating and 58.5% have a garage or a parking space.

With the fact that the town is urbanized almost in its entirety, it becomes increasingly more difficult to build larger houses to accommodate families who don&#x27;t live in the city. The edge of the lake and the hills are beginning to be saturated where there is a sprawl from the surrounding communities. It is worth noting the presence of much accommodation within former large luxury hotels, ruins from the Belle Époque, now gone.

===Planning projects===
Several projects of the municipality are underway in the downtown area, on the western shore of the lake as well as mainly to the south. This is to establish new areas of commercial activity to attract new business to the Aix economic area. The establishment of new residential areas is also scheduled. In collaboration with the municipalities of Méry and Drumettaz-Clarafond, through concerted urban development, the town of Aix-les-Bains contributes to the emergence of an activity called the &quot;Savoie Hexapôle&quot; area and also enables the development of a commercial area serving all of the southern sector of the Aix area.

The &quot;ZAC des Bords du Lac&quot;, under construction, will extend over about at the location of, among others, the former municipal campground of . This very controversial project is yet to be launched by the Deputy Mayor Dominique Dord&#x27;s municipal team. This new district, developed by the &quot;Society for the Development of the Savoy&quot; was named &quot;Aix–du Lac&quot;.

A -wide promenade was built, between Barrier and Garibaldi Boulevards, named &quot;Allée promenade des bords de lac&quot;. This is essentially the opening of a road with a narrow lane of traffic in both directions. The rest will be dedicated to pedestrians, cyclists and trees. This lane will host &quot;high environmental quality&quot; accommodation and nearby businesses that will benefit residents of the neighborhood and buildings under construction.
In 2013, one of the major projects of the municipal council was the restoration of the course of the and the creation of a harbour for boats at the &quot;Petit Port&quot; near this river leading into the Lac du Bourget. The work amounts to 7 million Euros. By rearranging the small harbor, the city wants to take advantage of the situation by decontaminating the River Tillet, which is heavily polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The municipality and the chose for a solution to store the PCB-contaminated soil on-site. The waste transport solution to a specialized treatment center was not successful. Among the comments from various stakeholders in the project, it was said: &quot;It (the contaminated soil) will be placed in a watertight compartment and will be used to make an embankment to widen the roadway of the Garibaldi Boulevard, which runs alongside Le Pêcheur campsite, and to develop sidewalks and parking.

The work to the harbour for boats has also brought upheavals to the level of traffic. &quot;Petit Port&quot; will become a cul-de-sac. Barrier Boulevard, previously connected to the &quot;Petit Port&quot; Avenue, will no longer be so in the future, as the municipality decided to postpone the flow of traffic on the Garibaldi Boulevard, this boulevard will become the new main road to get to the Barrier Boulevard through the small streets which form the way of Biatres and, with a fusion of greenery, a new axis between the business district and the Sierroz campsite. The &quot;Boulevard du port aux filles&quot; will become a one-way street, except for buses.

==Toponymy==
Aix-les-Bains, a city founded in the 1st century AD, is rarely mentioned in the epigraphic texts, and never known by Roman authors. However, two inscriptions preserved by the Archaeological Museum mention of the Latin &quot;Aquae&quot; (literally: &quot;Waters&quot; cf. Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) or Aix-en-Provence) and &quot;Aquensis&quot; (local residents of water), so information is provided about the name of this vicus dependent on the city of Vienne. The historians of the 19th century were sometimes subjected to read fanciful names which are without historical foundation, some of which still appear in some books. These include &quot;Aquae allobrogium&quot;, &quot;Aquae gratianæ&quot; (an inscription which adorned the façade of the National Baths from 1934 to 1968, and to commemorate the Emperor Gratian, who was assassinated not far away, in Lyon, in 383) and &quot;Allobrogum Aquae Gratianæ&quot;. The name &quot;Aquae&quot; is found in the deed of the gift of the royal land of Aix (&quot;de Acquis&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot;) by King Rudolph III of Burgundy to his wife Ermengarde, in 1011. Some texts from the Middle Ages mention of &quot;Aquae grationapolis&quot;. This suffix simply stating that Aix was part of the diocese of Grenoble.

The first known mention of Aix-les-Bains appears in the archives from September 1792, in a letter from a French soldier recuperating at Aix waters. It is this name which then appears in all official documents, including the deliberations of the municipal council. In the early 19th century, some literary texts made use of the appellation: Aix en Savoie. However, this name has never been used in administrative documents. Since 1954, the railway station of Aix-les-Bains, at the request of the council, has been called Aix-les-Bains-le Revard.

==History==
The history of Aix-les-Bains is directly related to the Lac du Bourget and especially to its hot springs which made it a spa among the most renowned in the world. The historical analysis of the town must be closer to the history of the Savoy, if we are to better understand its evolution and its cultural influences. Below are periods and historical highlights of the commune of Aix-les-Bains.

===&quot;Aquae&quot;: Roman Aix===

Historians agree that Aix was born from its sources of water to Ancient Rome, on the remains of a Celtic habitat. The first occupation of the site has been dated by Alain Canal to the first century BCE, however there is nothing to suggest these remains were a fixed habitat. We are left with the remains in public institutions and it would be difficult to draw a sketch of ancient &quot;Aquae&quot;. The administrative situation of the place is known by epigraphy, which teaches us that Aix was, in the 1st century AD, a vicus, with a board of &quot;decemlecti&quot; (a council of ten members), and was administratively part of Vienne. Some citizens lived there with, apparently, quite important resources to offer to the gods, a sacred wood, a vine or to build a funeral arch for the case of the Campanii family.

During their excavations, archaeologists have discovered a large thermal complex, in close proximity to its sources. On a lower terrace, to the west, was the Arch of Campanus, probably built in the 1st century, and more downstream, a second terrace carried the temple said to be dedicated to Diana, which had replaced a more ancient circular edifice by the 2nd century, which was probably contemporary with the Arch of Campanus. Remains of a necropolis have been cleared north of the temple. The &quot;Parc des Thermes&quot;, and various other locations scattered in the town, contain numerous and very varied remains, such as remains of the necropolis and pottery, etc. However, there is no centrepiece which would have led to extensive archaeological excavations. Otherwise, we know nothing of the Gallo-Romans of the &quot;Aquae&quot; vicus, in scope or in the provision of the habitat. Where did the &quot;Romans&quot; live? Where were their farms, the villages of their staff; What were the activities of the vicus? The mystery is still present. The only clues come from the archaeological map of the remains by archaeological services of the DRAC, and for archaeologist Alain Canal to conclude, &quot;Paradoxically, if Aix has delivered many documents illustrating the age of the site and the quality of the monumental town planning from the beginning of the Roman Empire, we have no precise knowledge about the order of this town.&quot;

As a synthesis, the history of the period can be reduced to the occupation of the town centre site from the 1st century BCE, followed by a gradual development of the area between the 1st and 2nd centuries. Occupation seems to be made from the progressive construction of the thermal complex, around which radiated monumental buildings presented on a system of terraces, which had evolved several times during the Roman period. If hot springs were originally the reason for choosing the location, other factors, such as the quality of the site, may have been decisive.

===From the Middle Ages to the Renaissance===

The already poor knowledge of Aix history from Roman times is further obscured due to the lack of sources regarding the end of the Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. We are left to conjecture by studying the destruction from the barbarian invasions that have left traces of fires on Gallo-Roman villas of the area, such as at Arbin. The fact remains that the Roman Baths of Aix fell to ruins from the fifth century and traces of urban development are lost.

Aix-les-Bains is again mentioned in sources from the 9th century, in 867, and in 1011 through charters. In the latter, King Rudolph III of Burgundy donated the villa of Aix, called a royal seat, with its settlers and its slaves to his wife Ermengarde who, in turn, pass them to the bishopric of Grenoble. This Charter tells us that Aix is a small town with a church and agricultural areas. Bishop Hugues of Grenoble then donated it to the monastery of Saint-Martin de Miserere, at the beginning of the 12th century. The church erected a new priory under the name of Sainte Marie.

At the end of the 12th century, the cartulary of Saint Hugues reveals the existence of two other parishes, Saint-Simond with its church and that of Saint-Hippolyte (in the current area of Mouxy) also with a small priory. Urban geography begins to clarify: One can imagine the small town, contained in its walls, which nobody knew when was built. The central point of the town is the priory, near the ancient Roman temple. This centre could also have been the administrative centre since at least the 13th century. Aix was a seigneurie subservient to the de Seyssel family, who had a château which, even if we do not place with certainty, was probably the location of the actual château. Two hamlets are attested, Saint-Hippolyte, in the immediate vicinity of the town but outside the ramparts, with a small priory at the centre and at its side, now under the Villa Chevalley, a strong House, the &quot;maison forte de Saint-Pol&quot; [strong House of Saint-Pol], dependent upon the de Savoie family which recent studies date back to the 13th century. A second important village appears, Saint Simond (Saint Sigismond) with it having a church and a cemetery, established as a parish, and a dependent of Saint-Hippolyte.

The texts suggest the existence of other villages including a certified record from 1561, during the general census of the population for the salt tax. At that time, there were about 1095 inhabitants of Aix, 46% living in the village; Saint Simond had 125 inhabitants, Puer had 91 people, Chaudhary had 87 people and Lal had 86 people, with the rest of the hamlets, about a dozen, sharing the rest. (Marlioz having escaped from the sources). This geography of the habitat seems frozen until the end of the 19th century. In Aix, the nearby Abbey of Hautecombe owned a large area at the heights of Saint Simond.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the ancient church suffered a devastating fire. The Aix people requested the help of Claude de Seyssel in order to rebuild. He was a seigneurial family member of the town, and was raised to the episcopal dignity. He was the Bishop of Albi, and an especially special advisor to the King of France Louis XII. He is also the author of a number of treaties. With support from De Seyssel the people were able to build a collegiate church, with a chapter of twelve canons, commissioned by a dean, whose appointment was returned to the count. A church was built on the nearby square of the cemetery, which included a choir of flamboyant Gothic style. If the choir belonged to the collegiate church, the nave belonged to the parishioners and presented a more plain appearance. Besides, the poorly constructed roof collapsed in 1644. Among the side chapels, one was reserved for the De Seyssels of Aix, in which is buried their dead. The collegiate church, fully a parish church after the Revolution, was demolished in 1909, after the construction of the new church. This church was known to house a relic of the true cross, which had been worshipped from a distance. It is also at the end of the Middle Ages that the stately Château of Aix was rebuilt. The ceiling of the Great Hall of the ground floor is dated to 1400. The magnificent staircase of honour was built around 1590.

===During the 18th century===
On 9 April 1739, a huge fire broke out in the town centre and destroyed 80 homes, nearly half of the town. Reconstruction was made with appeal for subsidies from the king, who imposed an alignment plan whose implementation was entrusted to the engineer Garella. This plan went further than a simple plan of reconstruction since it provided a true alignment of streets, and imposed some rules of urbanism as, for example, the construction of houses of two floors and a ground floor; it also prohibited thatched roofs. However, it was very limited in its scope since it concerned only the burned area or the main street (Rue Albert I), the central square (Place Carnot) and Rue des Bains.

At the beginning of the 17th century, the Aix people and the medical world had begun to become aware of the value of the hot springs of Aix, through the writings of the dauphinois physician Jean Baptiste Cabias, who was followed in this area by other renowned doctors. Indeed, since ancient times the exploitation of sources of hot water had never been completely forgotten. Bathing took place in Aix in the Middle Ages and until the end of the 18th century, in the only existing Roman pool, outdoors, or at home where the spa water was brought by hand. The King of France Henry IV highly appreciated his Aix bath, according to Jean Baptiste Cabias. In 1737, to protect the hot springwater seepage from the stream running through the city, a major project was scheduled by the General Commissariat. This changed the urban distribution of the town centre, since it was necessary to dig a new bed for the Moulins stream, outside the walls. They also had to rebuild the four mills of the Marquis of Aix, until then in the town centre, along the new channel (currently Montée des moulins, &quot;Hill of Mills&quot;).

It is the Duke of Chablais, son of King Victor Amadeus III, to whom Aix owes its renaissance because it was he who, after having tasted the benefit of sources and found it to be poorly housed, suggested the construction of a thermal establishment to the king. By royal appointment on 11 June 1776, King Victor Amadeus III commissioned Robiland to draw up plans for a bathing establishment. It was built from 1779 to 1783, under the direction of the engineer, Capellini. This date also marks the beginning of the demolition of the old town centre, as a result of this imposing construction, people began to clear the surrounding houses to create the place. This first thermal establishment became an important factor of development.

Throughout this period and until the Revolution, the town hosted a roughly stable number of approximately 600 patients each year, the majority of them French. Consecutively, the population increased, reaching 1700 inhabitants in 1793. In 1783, to enhance the lives of the patients, the council of the municipality built a landscaped public promenade: &quot;le Gigot&quot; currently known as Square Alfred Boucher. It was then lined with chestnut trees and was drawn by architect Louis Lampro. Aside from private gardens, this is the first act of urban green space, which gave a boost to the development of the town at this side of the walls, along the road to Geneva.

In 1792 the French revolutionary troops, under the command of Montesquiou, were in Savoy. The civilian use of the spa then stalled. The baths were requisitioned by the armies of the Republic, which sent the wounded soldiers for convalescence. However, it was also an opportunity to publicise Aix to the greatest number. Aix became Aix-les-Bains. With the Revolution accomplished, the privileges of the local nobility were abolished, and this especially helped the town from paying the Lord Marquess of Aix the large sum of money which it owed him for the redemption of seigneurial rights (the town had no charter of franchise). Furthermore, freedom of established trade gave new impetus to the creation of an economy based on the exploitation of the springs as soon as peace was regained. Then we see the development of boarding houses, hotels, cabarets and restaurants. On the other hand, the Revolution left its marks on church property, such as the abandonment of the collegiate church, destruction of the bell tower and the church furniture.

It was at the lakeside where one could find new development. The small Puer harbour breakwater, built under the Ancien Régime in 1720 became a real port. First frequented by boats refuelling the troops of the army of the Alps, equipped with a military store, it is gradually built for export goods and, in particular, from the trinkets of workshops installed at the edge of the Lake. It became known as the Port of Puer. The development of this neighbourhood involved improvement of the &quot;avenue du lac&quot; [avenue of the lake] and all this activity attracted the first buildings along this busy avenue, outside of the centre and of the existing villages.

===Negotiations for the independence of Morocco===
The negotiations for the independence of Morocco were held in Aix-les-Bains. At the conference of September 1955, the President of the French Council, in the person of Edgar Faure, publicly summed up the compromise proposed in Morocco, in the expression &quot;Independence within interdependence&quot;. Until then, Moroccan territory was legally a French protectorate and Sultan Mohammed V was in forced exile. The negotiations were held in the presence of numerous personalities and French and Moroccan organizations. At the talks, Moroccan side tabled the Democratic Independence Party (PDI) as well as the Istiqlal Party, represented by Mehdi Ben Barka, Omar Benabdeljalil, Abdelhadi Boutaleb, Abderrahim Bouabid and also M&#x27;hamed Boucetta. On the French side, the delegation consisted of Edgar Faure, , Robert Schuman and other members of the government. In addition to these were invited guests, from all walks, capable of giving advice on the status of Morocco and independence. Faithful allies of the protectorate and the Moroccan traditional chiefs were also invited. Thus, they could also negotiate in the presence of the parties concerned. They were given precedence, if possible, to the disappointment of the Istiqlal Party.

Although these negotiations held in Aix-les-Bains played an important role in the march towards the independence of Morocco, the fact remains that France had previously taken care to largely prepare for this transition. Indeed, the French State was convinced of the need to allow independence to this North African territory. However, with many economic interests at stake and many business relationships, notably the pashas and qaids, pushed France to take care not to rush this transition and initiate this change, smoothly. The destiny of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco was drawn during this conference at Aix-les-Bains. Officially, negotiations made it possible to reach an agreement to give birth to an independent state. Morocco was finally proclaimed independent during the declaration of La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 6 November 1955. In 2005, there was the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the negotiation of the agreements of the independence of Morocco. For this occasion, a fountain with a pool was made in Moroccan zellige. came specially from their spiritual home to complete this work in the &quot;parc de verdure&quot; of Aix-les-Bains. The project was supported by the regional council of tourism of the city of Fez (Fez-CRT) and the tourist office.

These offices are competent at giving, among other things, guidance for employment matters, an accompaniment to inhabitants&#x27; projects (mainly from the fabric), health, law, housing, culture, education and recreation. These decentralized local structures allow the dissemination of information on municipal projects as well as the future projects where the inhabitants can, if necessary, have the opportunity to be able to express their opinion.

These figures were not consistent with the national trend, it being in opposition. This vote demonstrated the privileged nature of the inhabitants of the town compared to rural departments with significant pools of workers.

===Environmental policy===

On the Lac du Bourget, with several thousand people in addition to tens of thousands of tourists, the water quality had gradually deteriorated from the 1950s to 1970 in a major phenomenon of eutrophication, since the lake at the time was the natural outlet of all sewer pipes, with in particular, Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains. Many motor vehicles of the time were also highly polluting, spitting their fumes which partially dissolved in the waters and spilt oil which was also found in the lake. They made a lot of noise and noise generated was damaging to birds and small mammals. A remediation action has been engaged since the mid-1970s, in order to reduce the eutrophication of the lake, the aim being to arrive at the same results as for Lake Annecy.

Services of water treatment stations have been established in Savoy and in particular to Aix-les-Bains. Rivers such as the and the have thus been remediated, improving upon the quality of the waters of the lake and the regeneration of aquatic species. Aix-les-Bains has a public aquarium for the conservation of local species such as trout, Arctic char and carp. This establishment mainly specialises in freshwater fish. The allows not only to help the local wildlife conservation but also for prevention work and educational visits.
The city also offers trails marked and arranged allowing hikers to travel in the direction of Mont Revard. These courses are used by athletes, walkers and cyclists. These paths are regularly maintained, eliminating the spread of detritus in green spaces. The municipality also has a municipal park, the . Here there are also many trails. The desire was to create a forest here without pomp, where nature evolves freely.

Many events are held at Aix-les-Bains. The convention centre, the or even the Victoria Cinema contribute to the special conferences, such as for broadcasts of documentaries, films and ecology. Between 27 and 29 September 2005 the first national water meeting was organized. The municipality wanted to, through organised days, increase the exchange of information and experiences for greater synergy in the field of preservation and protection of water. It also created and published the Charter of Environmental Quality and Accessibility at construction sites. This charter aims to reduce and limit pollution caused by urban sites such as noise pollution, waste products and water and soil pollution.

===Companies of the agglomeration===
The companies and institutions total at 1 January 2006 was 2,624. Aix-les-Bains had reached a number of 198 new businesses for the year 2004. It lay at 216th position in the national ranking. There are mainly thirteen types of institutions. Agricultural and food industry institutions represent 3.3% of the total number of companies with a number of 58.

Moreover, in recent years the hospitality sector has tended to develop. Hospitality giant Accor is particularly present in the area of Aix, in order to benefit from the growth of health markets and hydrotherapy.

===Trade===

Aix-les-Bains has nearly 500 shops. These are, for the largest number, present in the town centre. Merchants benefit from the attractiveness of the geographical situation of the commune with the proximity of the lake and the Massif des Bauges, but also thanks to the casino. However, its aging image as well as competition from neighbouring communes tend to undermine the Aix shops. Indeed, the peripheral communes such as Tresserve, Grésy-sur-Aix, Albens or even Le Bourget-du-Lac attract ever slightly more local clientele. On the other hand, the Chambéry area is facing competition from the area of activity of Les Landiers, where most of the big names are, such as Darty, &quot;la Halle aux vêtements&quot;, &quot;Feu vert&quot;, but also the large Carrefour hypermarket. This presence has forced the town of Chambéry to revitalize its own town centre. Aix-les-Bains shops have, in this general situation, struggled to survive and attract potential customers.

However, the Aix-les-Bains municipality became aware of this state of affairs. A Fisac record has been opened. The city has set many objectives and measures. For example, to include the creation of an office of trade and crafts, which organises special events à la carte, the creation of an internet site, support for food shops, the study of facilities in the south of the town as well as on the improvement of the bond between the Lac du Bourget and the town centre, the valuation of public space, and more generally the improvement of communication and the development of multiple channels of information for advice.

===Hydrotherapy===
Springs, gushing on the hillsides, through two holes in the cliff, were already known to the Celts (the Allobroges tribe), who worshipped them under the auspices of the god Borvo. Attached to the city of Vienne, after the conquest of Caesar, the Roman vicus of Aquae (Aix) grew around a first-class bathing establishment, continually improved and expanded. Therefore, this tradition of baths was permanently preserved over the centuries. There are also testimonies of the presence of King Henry IV in 1600, who washed in the unique Roman swimming pool still accessible at the time, called the &quot;Royal Bath&quot;. In 1783, through the subsidies of King Victor Amadeus III, a first modern thermal hotel was built. These thermal baths, several times enlarged (1818 to 1856–1860), naturally became the national baths during the incorporation of Savoy into France in 1860. New buildings completed the complex in 1897, and especially in 1934. In 1996, a new state institution, the Thermes Chevalley were inaugurated, relying on several new deep catchment sources.

The underground travel of the waters, from the opposite shore of the lake (more than thirty years at deep), explains its temperature of 46°. Many sources provide calcium, sulphated, silica-rich waters which are very slightly radioactive at 45° or cold, and finally with bicarbonates. They, according to their origin and their temperature, are used either for showers or baths, in a swimming-pool, or to drink. These warm waters are especially indicated for degenerative rheumatism such as lumbar or cervical arthritis, osteoarthritis, sciatica, acute lumbago, recurrent arthritis of the hands, knee osteoarthritis, and for inflammatory rheumatism and spontylarthrite rheumatism. The use of sources is also beneficial for the algodystrophy, tendonitis, and phlebological problems (chronic venous insufficiency, suites and sequelae of thrombosis, lymphatic insufficiency, Raynaud&#x27;s disease), on the other hand, these waters are contraindicated for the varicose ulcer, stroke or recent cardiac events. The cure techniques are the use of showers, individual enclosure (Berthollet), physiotherapy, mud application, underwater showers, and rehabilitation in a swimming pool. By their calming of the nervous system, the waters can cause euphoric relaxation.
The national baths of Aix-les-Bains consist of two buildings located on two very distinct sites. Thus the Thermes Pellegrini and the Thermes Chevalley Spa facilities are located on the height.

There is also the Marlioz Spa. This is located in a park of . It uses water from springs discovered around 1850. A first private institution was built in 1860, then entirely rebuilt in 1980. This spa is particularly suitable for the release of the respiratory system and heals diseases of the mouth. Treated ENT diseases are otitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, the pharyngitis, tonsillitis, the laryngitis, surgical preparations and post-surgical in ENT. Also treated are pathologies in pneumology, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchial dilation and finally asthma.

Thanks to its thermal baths, in 1986, the town had around 52,000 hydrotherapy visitors and 1992, more than 44,550 hydrotherapy visitors. Since the year 2000, as a result of the disappearance of the agreements with the social security, attendance has decreased. Aix-les-Bains hosted approximately 35,200 hydrotherapy visitors for the year 2005. This number represents about 7% of all spa guests in France and 60% of the Savoy hydrotherapy visitors. Between the year 2004 and 2005, a significant decrease of 3% in the rate of attendance was found. March 2008 began with a serious conflict between staff and management which resulted in a strike. Since 2007, the direction of the National Baths of Aix-les-Bains conducted a deliberate policy to revitalize attendance and privatise the facility. This privatisation should be effective in the course of the year 2009.

==Local culture and heritage==
Aix-les-Bains is an integral part of the Savoy. A tourist resort, the culture is mixed between its food and its communal history. Its heritage is an anthology of influences from many historical invasions. It owes much to its status as a spa town which in the Belle Epoque allowed it to boom and offered it a rich and varied heritage capital. Therefore, it is classified as a City of Art and History.

===Places and monuments===

It has no less than 1163 buildings which have thus retained some attention.

====Casino Grand-Cercle====
The Casino Grand-Cercle is located in Aix-les-Bains, and constitutes a major architectural complex in Savoy, in the same way as the casino of Évian. The casino was opened in 1850 by the King Victor-Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. The ceiling of his living room is covered with a mosaic of 3.5 million small cubes of glass mounted on a golden background. At the time, the building included a ballroom at its centre, flanked by two rooms, one for games, the other for reading and correspondence. Thirty years later, the casino had gained momentum and was expanded with two side pavilions. In 1899, the building acquired a 900-seat theatre, equipped with wooden machinery. Recently four works by the painter were placed in the room of traditional games (boules, roulette, blackjack, etc.). The Casino Grand-Cercle was ranked at 24th in the classification of French casinos, on the basis of its gross product from the games for the fiscal year of 2004–2005.

====Château of the Rock of the King====
The Château of the Rock of the King is a 20th-century château. It is located on the heights of Aix-les-Bains, built on a hillside, the château dominates much of the town and overlooks the racecourse and golf course among others. It was built in 1900 by the architect of the town, Jules Pin Sr. as well as by the Léon Grosse company. This château is now a classified historical monument. Its architectural style is a mix of oriental palaces and châteaux of the Renaissance. The total area of the building is approximately . It is built on a terrace supported by a vaulted semicircular basement. Outside of the château, in its periphery, is a dense forest of many hundreds of trees, brush, and plants common to the region. The château currently belongs to a foreign private owner. The town attempted to acquire the building after noting that it was abandoned for many years, and after several major damages had been reported and multiple interventions by firefighters called to deal with fires.

====The Church of Our Lady====
The Notre-Dame-des-Eaux (&#x27;Our Lady of the Waters&#x27;) Church, parish of the Assumption, is located in the centre of Aix-les-Bains. An architectural competition was held to design the religious building and was won by Arthur Bertin. The construction was entrusted to the Bonna company. Work began in 1890 with completion planned for 1892 while, in reality, changes were still made until 1905.

The building takes the form of a cross. The general appearance is of Byzantine inspiration. The crossing of the transepts supports a dome. The colour of its green steeple is due to the oxidation of its cover which is made of wood. The tower rises above the courtyard. One can also admire its simple barrel vaults which, for their part, are of rather Romanesque inspiration. The Way of the Cross, currently ranking in the supplementary inventory of historic monuments, comes from Spain, from where it was brought by , during the campaigns of Napoleon. The tables of the Twelve Apostles, classified since 1976, and preserved in the choir, definitely come from Italy, according to expertise, and would be of 17th century origin. The building dominates the heights of the Aix-les-Bains town, and it is very present in the daily life of the inhabitants.

The square in front of the church is used for public parking during the week, due to its central location in the urban fabric.

====The Faure Museum====
The Faure Museum is based on works originally from a private collection, that of Dr. Jean Faure (1862–1942). They were bequeathed to the city and kept, in a villa built in 1902, since 1949. This museum has the second greatest French collection of works of Rodin with not less than thirty-four sculptures, not counting the master studies. The establishment also displays a collection of paintings concerning impressionism to the public. Associated painters, such as those of romanticism, post-impressionism and symbolism are also displayed. It holds the second largest impressionist collection of the province.

====Other buildings====

The town of Aix-les-Bains is dotted with numerous historic buildings as well as buildings of character. Of the Gallo-Roman era, there is the &quot;Arc funéraire romain de Campanus&quot; [Roman funerary Arch of Campanus]. This arch was erected by the patrician of Gallia Narbonensis, Lucius Pompeius Campanus, honouring the dead of his family. This monument is a symbol representing the passage to the afterlife. The arch has a height of more than . It consists of an archway between two pillars surmounted by an entablature with architrave, all made of cut stones fitted without mortar. The arch includes a frieze, cornice and an attic. The frieze has eight niches to house the busts of some of the characters to which the arch is dedicated.

There is also the impressive building of the &quot;Thermes antiques&quot; [ancient baths]. Around 120 BC, the Romans built these comfortable baths in Roman fashion, such as was the case throughout the Empire. The structure includes several baths from a hot bath (caldarium), and a warm bath (tepidarium), to a cold bath (frigidarium). All of the basins are covered in marble. The rooms were decorated with columns and sculptures. Currently, the Roman ruins are still visible inside the national baths.

Also of note is the current Aix-les-Bains town hall. Originally, it was a mansion belonging to Conrad the Peaceful, then a château of the Marquis of Aix between the 15th and the 17th century. Next to the town hall there is the Gallo-Roman temple, known as the &quot;Temple de Diane&quot; [Temple of Diana] which became the Lapidary Museum. This ancient shrine is one of three temples in France which are fully preserved. Today converted into the Archaeological Museum, the building houses many statues and antique objects, as well as items from the Bronze Age.

===Gastronomy===

The cuisine of Aix-les-Bains is typical of Savoy, based on products of the local soil and mountain meadows, essentially the Bauges. In addition to its famous fondue, there is the pleasing main course of potato doughnuts, and also crozets, péla, tartiflette, diots, polenta and . For dessert, there are bugnes, confiture de lait and blueberry pie. Aix tables feature Savoy cheeses such as Abondance, Beaufort, the , , , , Reblochon, Abbaye de Tamié, Tomme de Savoie and still many others. However, the presence of the Lac du Bourget, and the rivers such as the Tillet and the Sierroz, offer a variety of freshwater fish, to Aix cooks, which make up good number of local dishes. The local trout, Arctic char and the vendace are pleasing to eat. Also fishing and frying pike delights the taste buds of the inhabitants of Aix-les-Bains. The surrounding forests and mountains of average altitude, such as Mont Revard, offer popular produce. There are fungi, for instance, and the reputation of , boletes of Revard, continues unabated. Several vineyards around the Aix-les-Bains commune produce wines used in many specialities, such as Savoy fondue, by the use of white wine. Thus, the vineyards of Saint-Innocent and of Saint-Baldoph are found near Aix-les-Bains, and the area generally enjoys most of the wines of Savoy.

===Cultural heritage===

The town of Aix-les-Bains has several facilities to promote culture. The presence of the allows the municipality to have a theatre. Commonly known as Théâtre du Casino, it is a masterpiece of the 19th century. It offers a capacity of nine hundred seats and a stage of . This Italian theatre has an orchestra pit, an organ and a cinema screen. The casino owner is regularly solicited for the use of this room for film and television shoots, because of its authentic ornamentation. More original still, Aix-les-Bains enjoys an outdoor theatre called the &quot;Théâtre de verdure&quot; in the city centre, in the park known as the &quot;Parc Floral des Thermes&quot;. It has a capacity of three thousand seats for outdoor concerts. Tea dances are regularly organized, as well as the Aquascénies event, and also parts of theatres. One of the main halls of the commune is the convention centre of Aix-les-Bains. Exhibitions, congresses, concerts, live comedy, and many other artistic and cultural events are organised here.

Aix-les-Bains was one of the earliest French cities to have had a cinema. Today it has no less than three cinemas which are the &quot;Victoria&quot;, the &quot;Rex&quot;, and the &quot;Les Toiles du Lac&quot; of Aix-les-Bains. These three institutions are all owned by the same owner. With the creation of the multiplex &quot;Les Toiles du Lac&quot; offering eight rooms, the &quot;Rex&quot; with its two rooms is slowly disappearing. The &quot;Victoria&quot;, with its five rooms, should be retained and is still in operation. It is expected to gradually accommodate original films, arts films and trial releases. In addition, the establishment has the second casino of Aix-les-Bains. Smaller than the Casino Grand-Cercle, the &quot;Nouveau Casino&quot;, which is its commercial name, has an honorable playground of forty-five slot machines, a boule table, thirteen rollers (dice, roulette, etc.), fifteen video-rollers and seventeen video-poker screens.

The &quot;Musée Lapidaire&quot; is located in a former Gallo-Roman temple of Diana, now converted into an archaeological museum. The building contains many statues and antique objects, including items from the Bronze Age. You can see the remnants of settlements from the Lac du Bourget. Another place of heritage and cultural influence, the Lamartine Municipal Library has a large document fonds. The name is a tribute to the poet and writer Alphonse de Lamartine. The premises should soon be changed, closer to the national baths and Roman baths.

Several are present in the town of Aix-les-Bains. These associations allow enlightened amateurs and specialists to meet around various themes, particularly, regional history or the study of the regional cultural heritage. Present, particularly in the town, are the &quot;Société du Patrimoine de Savoie&quot; [Society of the Heritage of Savoie] (SPS) founded in Aix-les-Bains in 1995, the &quot;Société d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire d&#x27;Aix-les-Bains et sa Région&quot; [Society of Art and history of Aix-les-Bains and its Region], founded in 1993, and the Lakeside Archaeology Centre of Aix-en-Savoie, founded in 1975.

<text>Take Back Your Government!: A Practical Handbook for the Private Citizen Who Wants Democracy to Work was an early work by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein. It was published in 1992 after his death in 1988.

Originally entitled How to Be a Politician, the book was written in 1946 but never found a publisher, perhaps due to excess candor. Like so many of Heinlein&#x27;s works, he wrote what he knew. In this case, he based the work on his experience in California politics in the 1930s, particularly his efforts on behalf of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s End Poverty in California (EPIC) movement and Sinclair&#x27;s attempt to become the Democratic nominee for governor of California in 1934.

The book contains annotations by Jerry Pournelle, who had little time to finish, polish, or fact-check, because the publishers demanded the work be available during Ross Perot&#x27;s campaign for president.

A new edition was published in 2012, with an introduction by Heinlein biographer William H. Patterson, Jr.

<doc id="321199" wikidata="Q1757732" url="?curid=321199" title="Preview (macOS)">
<text>Preview is the built-in image viewer and PDF viewer of the macOS operating system. In addition to viewing and printing digital images and Portable Document Format (PDF) files, it can also edit these media types. It employs the Aqua graphical user interface, the Quartz graphics layer, and the ImageIO and Core Image frameworks.

==History==
Like macOS, Preview originated in the NeXTSTEP operating system by NeXT, where it was part of every release since 1989. Between 2003 and 2005, Apple claimed Preview was the &quot;fastest PDF viewer on the planet.&quot;

==Supported file types==
Preview can open the following file types.

* AI – Adobe Illustrator artwork files (if PDF content included in file)
* BMP – Windows bitmap files
* CR2 – Raw image file used by Canon cameras
* DAE – Collada 3D files
* DNG – Digital negative files
* FAX – Faxes
* FPX – FlashPix files
* GIF – Graphics Interchange Format files
* HDR – High-dynamic-range image files
* ICNS – Apple Icon Image files
* ICO – Windows icon files
* JPEG – Joint Photographic Experts Group files
* JPEG 2000 – JPEG 2000 files
* OBJ – Wavefront 3D file
* OpenEXR – OpenEXR files
* PDF – Portable Document Format version 1.5 + some additional features
* PICT – QuickDraw image files
* PNG – Portable Network Graphics files
* PPM – Netpbm Color Image files
* PNTG – MacPaint Bitmap Graphic files
* PPT – PowerPoint files
* PSD – Adobe Photoshop files
* QTIF – QuickTime image files
* RAD – Radiance 3D Scene Description files
* RAW – Raw image files
* SGI – Silicon Graphics Image files
* STL – STereoLithography 3D format
* TGA – TARGA image files
* TIF (TIFF) – Tagged Image File Format files
* XBM – X BitMap files
In macOS Monterey and earlier, Preview supported the display of EPS and PostScript documents using on-the-fly conversion to PDF format. However, this functionality was removed in macOS Ventura, although users can continue to print and files by dragging them into the printer queue.

The version of Preview included with OS X 10.3 (&quot;Panther&quot;) could play animated GIF images, for which an optional button could be added to the toolbar. As of OS X 10.4 (&quot;Tiger&quot;), Preview lost playback functionality and animated GIF files are displayed as individual frames in a numbered sequence.

==Features==
===Editing PDF documents===

Preview can encrypt PDF documents, and restrict their use; for example, it is possible to save an encrypted PDF so that a password is required to copy data from the document, or to print it. However, encrypted PDFs cannot be edited further, so the original author should always keep an unencrypted version. A new &quot;edit button&quot; where the picture can be edited is introduced in Version 7. The &quot;edit button&quot; allows options to insert shapes, lines, do cropping, and among other things.

Some features which are otherwise only available in professional PDF editing software are provided by Preview: It is possible to extract single pages out of multi-page documents (e.g. PDF files), sort pages, and drag &amp; drop single or multiple pages between several opened multi-page documents, or into other applications, such as attaching to an opened email message.

===Editing images===
Preview offers basic image correction tools using Core Image processing technology implemented in macOS, and other features like shape extraction, color extraction, cropping, and rotation tools. When annotating images, Preview uses vector shapes and text until the image is rasterized to JPEG, PNG or another bitmap format. PDF and image documents can also be supplied with keywords, and are then automatically indexed using macOS&#x27;s system-wide Spotlight search engine.

===Import and export===
Preview can directly access image scanners supported by macOS and import images from the scanner. Preview can convert between image formats; it can export to BMP, JP2, JPEG, PDF, PICT, PNG, SGI, TGA, and TIFF. Using macOS&#x27;s print engine (based on CUPS) it is also possible to &quot;print into&quot; a Postscript file, a PDF-X file or directly save the file in iPhoto, for example scanned photos.

Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Preview restricts the Format option popup menu in the Save As dialog to commonly used types. It is possible to access the full format list by holding down the Option key when clicking the Format popup menu. (GIF, ICNS, JPEG, JPEG-2000, Microsoft BMP, Microsoft Icon, OpenEXR, PDF, Photoshop, PNG, SGI, TGA, TIFF.)

<doc id="321200" wikidata="Q1778150" url="?curid=321200" title="Wright Company">
<text>The Wright Company was the commercial aviation business venture of the Wright brothers, established by them on November 22, 1909, in conjunction with several prominent industrialists from New York and Detroit with the intention of capitalizing on their invention of the practical airplane. The company maintained its headquarters office in New York City and built its factory in Dayton, Ohio.

== History ==
The two buildings designed by Dayton architect William Earl Russ and built by Rouzer Construction for the Wright Company in Dayton in 1910 and 1911 were the first in the United States constructed specifically for an airplane factory and were included within the boundary of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park in 2009.

The Wright Company concentrated its efforts on protecting the company&#x27;s patent rights rather than on developing new aircraft or aircraft components, believing that innovations would hurt the company&#x27;s efforts to obtain royalties from competing manufacturers or patent infringers. Wilbur Wright died in 1912, and on October 15, 1915, Orville Wright sold the company, which in 1916 merged with the Glenn L. Martin Company to form the Wright-Martin Company. Orville Wright, who had purchased 97% of the outstanding company stock in 1914 as he prepared to leave the business world, estimated that the Wright Company built approximately 120 airplanes across all of its different models between 1910 and 1915.

Many of the papers of the Wright Company are now in the collection of the Museum of Flight in Seattle, while others are held by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The Library of Congress also holds the papers of Grover Loening, the second Wright Company factory manager, while the papers of Frank Henry Russell, the first plant manager, are at the University of Wyoming&#x27;s American Heritage Center.

<doc id="321205" wikidata="Q448282" url="?curid=321205" title="Suzy Parker">
<text>Suzy Parker (born Cecilia Ann Renee Parker; October 28, 1932 – May 3, 2003) was an American model and actress active from 1947 until 1970. Her modeling career reached its zenith during the 1950s, when she appeared on the covers of dozens of magazines and in advertisements and movie and television roles.

She appeared in advertisements for Revlon and many other cosmetic companies, including Solo Products, the largest hair care product company in the country at the time. (Models did not have exclusive cosmetic company contracts until Lauren Hutton and Karen Graham in the early 1970s). In 1956, at the height of her modelling career, she became the first model to earn $100,000 per year (). A song that The Beatles wrote for her, though not released on record, appeared in their 1970 documentary film &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.

==Early life==
Suzy Parker was born Cecilia Ann Renee Parker in Long Island City, New York, to George and Elizabeth Parker, who married in 1916. The family later moved to Highland Park, New Jersey, and then to Florida.

She had three older sisters: Dorian, Florian, and Georgiabell. Elizabeth believed she was undergoing menopause, but then discovered she was several months pregnant with her youngest child, Cecilia (&quot;Suzy&quot;). Suzy&#x27;s original names came from three of her mother&#x27;s best friends. A then-teenaged Dorian advised her mother to arrange the names in the order, Cecilia Renee Ann Parker, so the initials of the names would spell the word &quot;crap&quot;. Dorian claimed her mother had no idea what it meant. Parker&#x27;s father George disliked the name Cecilia and called her Susie, a name which Parker would retain throughout her life. A French &quot;Vogue&quot; photographer later changed the spelling to &quot;Suzy&quot;.

==Career==
Parker and two of her sisters were tall, all measuring between and . Sister Dorian was the sole exception, standing . 

In 1944, Dorian worked as an advertising copy writer when a coworker encouraged her to go to the Conover Modeling Agency. Dorian became one of the top models in the world, among the first small group of supermodels, which included Lisa Fonssagrives, Dovima, Barbara Goalen and Bettina Graziani. When Suzy was about age 15, Dorian telephoned Ford Modeling Agency and told Eileen and Jerry Ford that she would sign on with them if they also took her younger sister, sight unseen. Eager to represent Dorian, they agreed. Expecting to meet a similarly petite, extremely thin, flawless, pale-faced, electric blue-eyed, raven-haired younger version of Dorian, they were shocked to meet Suzy for the first time. Parker was already 5&#x27;10&quot;, big-boned, and had carrot red hair, pale-green eyes, and freckles. She would become more famous than Dorian.

Suzy&#x27;s photo appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine when she was 15. That same year, one of her first magazine advertisements was for DeRosa Jewelry. Although she still lived with her parents in Florida, she stayed in New York City with Dorian when she had modeling assignments there. Dorian introduced Parker to her fashion-photographer friends, Irving Penn, Horst P. Horst, John Rawlings, and a young Richard Avedon. Parker became Avedon&#x27;s muse, she said years later that &quot;The only joy I ever got out of modeling was working with Dick Avedon.&quot; She became the so-called signature face of the Coco Chanel brand. Chanel herself became a close confidante, giving Parker advice on men and money as well as creating numerous Chanel outfits for her. 

Parker was a model with the Walter Thornton agency. She was the first model to earn $200 per hour and $100,000 per year. &quot;Vogue&quot; declared her one of the faces of the confident, post-war American woman. By 1955, she owed income taxes on her modeling income from previous years, amounting to more than $60,000 in back taxes and rapidly accumulating penalties, an enormous amount at the time. Jerry Ford paid her tax bill and found her assignments. She worked also non-stop for &quot;Vogue&quot;, Revlon, Hertz, Westinghouse, Max Factor, Bliss, DuPont, Simplicity, Smirnoff, and Ronson shavers, to name a few. She also was on the covers of about 70 magazines around the world, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot; and &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;. After being introduced to, and taught photography by, war photographer Robert Capa, Parker was briefly listed as a member of Magnum Photos.

Her first film role was in &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (1957), playing the main interest of Cary Grant&#x27;s character. Soon after she accepted a cameo role in &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957), on screen for two minutes in a musical number described as &quot;Pink Number&quot;. Her other films include: &quot;Ten North Frederick&quot; (1958), &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; (1959), &quot;A Circle of Deception&quot; (1960 - during which she met future husband Bradford Dillman), &quot;Flight from Ashiya&quot; (1964) and &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot; (1966). She also played dramatic roles in TV shows such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; plus appearances as herself on a number of quiz shows such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;.

Parker&#x27;s last role was in a 1970 episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;. She did, in a way, make one other film &quot;appearance&quot; in The Beatles&#x27; 1970 documentary film &quot;Let It Be&quot;, in which the band performed their song &quot;Suzy Parker&quot;. The song, one of the few credited as written by all four Beatles, was part of their Academy Award-winning score for the original songs they performed in the film.

==Relationships and children==
Parker was married three times. In 1950, she and her high-school sweetheart, Ronald Staton (some sources cite Charles), drove to Georgia to secretly marry. Parker said that she married him in a bikini with a raincoat on top, adding, &quot;He was very good-looking, and it [the marriage] was just a sheer disaster.&quot; The young couple drove back to Florida where she was still living with her parents who were upset because of her age and because Ronald was part Cherokee. They moved to Pennsylvania and rented a house near where Dorian was living with her husband and children. Parker was already modeling in the United States and Europe while Ronald was attending the University of Pennsylvania as a freshman.

Parker met journalist Pierre de la Salle (Pitou, born July 12, 1925) at a Jacques Fath party outside of Paris. She and Dorian were modeling together and separately on this trip. She returned to the United States and asked Ronald for a divorce, but he would only agree to a quick divorce if Parker gave him a large monetary settlement, paid for plastic surgery on his nose and paid for his acting lessons. She agreed, and their divorce was finalized in Mexico in 1953. Ronald was killed years later in an automobile accident. Parker and Pierre continued to date for years despite Pierre&#x27;s numerous infidelities. She also was paying for his high cost-of-living expenses. They married about 1957 or 1958, but the couple kept it a secret.

In 1958, Parker was a passenger in a car her father was driving when they were hit by an oncoming train. According to accident reports, neither of them heard or saw the train until it slammed into the car. Her father died of his injuries at the hospital. Parker was hospitalized, with broken bones and embedded glass, but with her face untouched, under the name Mrs. Pierre de la Salle. The press jumped on this, but Pierre continued to deny that they were married. Soon thereafter, a photo spread of the couple appeared in the August 19, 1958, &quot;Look&quot; magazine cover story about her. Parker began psychotherapy to cope with her rocky second marriage and the death of her beloved father.

After recovering from her injuries, Parker became pregnant and de la Salle left. She said, &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to be a father. I already hired a nanny... he was gone, history.&quot; She gave birth to their daughter Georgia Belle Florian Coco Chanel de la Salle in December 1959, whose godmother was close friend Coco Chanel. Parker named her daughter after her older sisters Georgiabell and Florian and purposely left Dorian’s name off. Dorian and Parker feuded for many years, as Parker was fed up with Dorian’s promiscuous lifestyle and her not taking care of her children. A March 14, 1977, &quot;People&quot; magazine article featured Parker trying to launch her then 17-year-old daughter Georgia as a model. However, Georgia modeled only a few times during and after college.

In 1960, Parker met actor Bradford Dillman on the set of their 1960 movie, &quot;A Circle of Deception&quot;. She was still married to de la Salle but no longer living with him. Dillman was ending his first marriage and dating Juliette Gréco at the time. Parker obtained a divorce and married Bradford in 1963 on board a boat at sea. She changed her name to Suzy Parker Dillman following the marriage.

After marrying Dillman in 1963, then receiving injuries in a car accident in 1964, Parker mostly retired from modeling and acted as a stepmother to Jeffrey and Pamela, Dillman&#x27;s children from his first marriage. Parker enjoyed being a stay-at-home mother and, like her sister Dorian, who was a Cordon Bleu-level chef, Parker was an excellent cook.

Parker had three children with Dillman: daughter Dinah and sons Charlie and Christopher. The family lived in Bel Air, Los Angeles, until Dinah was bitten by a rattlesnake in the yard and almost died. They then moved to Montecito in the Santa Barbara area, where Suzy remained until her death in 2003.

==Later years and death==
A self-described tomboy in her teens, Parker broke several bones as a result. Parker also broke bones in the 1958 car accident that killed her father. In 1964, she was nervously rehearsing for her famous appearance in the well-known &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Number 12 Looks Just Like You&quot; when she was in another car accident.

Parker long suffered from allergies, and in the 1990s, developed ulcers. During surgery for an ulcer, her vital signs disappeared on the operating table, but she was resuscitated. She never fully recovered and developed more ulcers and diabetes. She had multiple hip surgeries, and then her kidneys began to fail. She spent the last five years of her life in and out of the hospital.

Parker decided to end dialysis treatments. She returned home and died at age 70 surrounded by family at her orchard in Montecito, California, on May 3, 2003. Her husband Bradford Dillman died in 2018 at age 87.

<text>Personal bankruptcy law allows, in certain jurisdictions, an individual to be declared bankrupt. Virtually every country with a modern legal system features some form of debt relief for individuals. Personal bankruptcy is distinguished from corporate bankruptcy.

==By country==
The DICE report 2006 of Munich&#x27;s ifo Economic Research compared international personal bankruptcy in selected OECD-countries.

===United States===

In the United States, the same chapters of the Bankruptcy Code are applied in both personal and corporate bankruptcies. Most individuals who enter bankruptcy do so under Chapter 13 (a &quot;reorganization&quot; plan) or Chapter 7 (a &quot;liquidation&quot; of debtor&#x27;s assets). More rarely, personal bankruptcy proceedings are carried out under Chapter 11. The ultimate goal of personal bankruptcy, from the viewpoint of the debtor, is receiving a discharge.

In 2008, more than 96% of all bankruptcy filings were non-commercial and about two-thirds of these were chapter 7 cases.
Although the individual causes of bankruptcy are complex and multifaceted, most personal bankruptcies involve significant medical bills. Individual bankruptcies are usually filed under chapter 7 or chapter 13. According to the American Bankruptcy Institute, in 2017 38.8% of Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases ended in dismissal. In the first quarter of 2020, there were 175,146 individual bankruptcies in the United States. About 66.5% of these were directly related to medical problems.

===Canada===
The concept behind bankruptcy in Canada is that an individual assigns (surrender) everything they own to a trustee in bankruptcy in exchange for the elimination of their unsecured debts.

The rules for filing personal bankruptcy in each province and territory differ slightly. In some areas of Canada individuals may be permitted to keep (exempt) certain property. Common items for exemption include clothing, furniture, appliances, motor vehicles, medical and dental aids, a home, family heirlooms, and some insurance. In basic terms, any property the debtor might require to survive can be exempt. Personal Bankruptcy will eliminate most, if not all, of an individual’s debt, but it also impacts their future ability to obtain credit.

The cost of personal bankruptcy in Canada depends on the individual’s monthly family income, the size of the family, and their assets (such as RRSPs). An alternative to personal bankruptcy (in Canada) is a Consumer Proposal. Another option in Canada is a debt consolidation. No matter what option they choose, they can often turn to a trustee in bankruptcy for a free consultation.

===Israel===
Personal bankruptcy in Israel is governed by the Insolvency and Rehabilitation Law, 2018. Insolvency proceedings below NIS150,000 will be administered entirely by the Enforcement and Collection Authority. Insolvency proceedings above NIS150,000 will be conducted before the official receiver (the Insolvency Commissioner) and, if relevant, before the court with respect to further, more specific matters. Simultaneously, with the issue of the order for the commencement of insolvency proceedings, the Insolvency Commissioner shall appoint a trustee for the debtor and an audit will be carried out, in which the debtor’s economic capability and his conduct will be examined (lasting approximately 12 months).At the end of this audit a payment plan is established, at the end of which the debtor will receive a discharge. The default scenario is a payment period of three years, however, the court reserves the right to increase or decrease the period depending upon the circumstances of the case. If the debtor has no proven financial ability to pay the creditors, he may be granted an immediate discharge. Since 1996, Israeli personal bankruptcy law has shifted to a relatively debtor-friendly regime, not unlike the American model.

<text>Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation was a short-lived aircraft manufacturing business venture between the Wright Company (after Orville Wright sold the Wright Company and divested himself from it) and Glenn L. Martin.

==History==
Company officials merged their respective organizations, the Wright Company and the Glenn L. Martin Company, in 1916.

The company continued and escalated the Wright brothers patent war with other aircraft manufacturers, until its resolution—under duress from the government, in 1917, at the start of U.S. involvement in World War I—by the cross-licensing agreement developed and managed through the Manufacturers Aircraft Association.

A license-built version of the Hispano-Suiza 8 was manufactured by the company under the engineering leadership of Henry M. Crane. It was used by Vought VE-7, VE-8, Boeing NB-2, and Loening M-8.

By 1918, the company had a factory in Long Island City, New York. Martin soon resigned, dissolving the Wright-Martin joint enterprise within a year. The company was renamed Wright Aeronautical in 1919, and shifted from manufacturing aircraft to manufacturing aircraft engines, developing the pivotal Wright Whirlwind engines which changed aviation dramatically.

He continued development of his Glenn L. Martin Company, which remained a major aircraft manufacturer until the 1950s, when it also began developing rockets, missiles, and spacecraft. In 1961, the company merged with the American-Marietta Corporation to become industrial conglomerate (and continued aerospace manufacturer) Martin Marietta; it merged with Lockheed in 1995 to become today&#x27;s Lockheed Martin, one of the United States&#x27; three remaining major large aircraft manufacturers (along with Boeing and Northrop Grumman).

<doc id="321214" wikidata="Q3053959" url="?curid=321214" title="End Poverty in California">
<text>End Poverty in California (EPIC) was a political campaign started in 1934 by socialist writer Upton Sinclair (best known as author of &quot;The Jungle&quot;). The movement formed the basis for Sinclair&#x27;s campaign for governor of California in 1934. The plan called for a massive public works program, sweeping tax reform, and guaranteed pensions. It gained major popular support, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. EPIC never came to fruition due to Sinclair&#x27;s defeat in the 1934 election, but is seen as an influence on New Deal programs enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

==Plan==
Sinclair laid out his vision for EPIC in his 1933 book &quot;I, Governor of California, and How I ended Poverty: A True Story of the Future&quot;. Specifically, the plan called for state seizure of idle factories and farm land where the owner had failed to pay property taxes. The government would then hire the unemployed to work on the farms and at the factories. The farms would then operate as self-sufficient, worker-run co-ops. EPIC also called for the implementation of California&#x27;s first state income tax. The tax was to be progressive, with the wealthiest being taxed at 30%. The plan would also have increased inheritance taxes and instituted a 4% tax on stock transfers. EPIC also included government-provided pensions for the old, disabled, and widowed. To implement EPIC, Sinclair called for the creation of three new government agencies: the California Authority for Land (CAL), the California Authority for Production (CAP), and the California Authority for Money (CAM). CAL was to implement the plan for seizure and cultivation of unused farm lands. CAP was to do the same for idle factories. CAM meanwhile was to be used to finance CAL and CAP by issuing scrip to workers and issues bonds for the purchase of lands, factories, and machinery.

==Campaign==

After two previous unsuccessful runs for the U.S. Congress as a member of the Socialist Party, Sinclair was encouraged by the election of President Roosevelt in 1932 to switch his affiliation to the Democratic Party in September 1933. A grassroots movement soon formed in support of EPIC, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. A weekly newspaper, the &quot;EPIC News&quot;, appeared in support of the plan, and reached a circulation of nearly a million by the time of the gubernatorial primary election in August 1934. Several EPIC-supporting candidates won their primaries for California State Assembly and Senate seats. Sinclair did not receive full support from the party establishment, however, and Roosevelt refused to endorse him, seeing the EPIC plan as too radical. Sinclair&#x27;s opponents claimed that he sought to &quot;Sovietize California&quot;.

The Socialist party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party including the Democratic Party and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign. The expulsions destroyed the Socialist party in California.

EPIC faced major opposition by the Republican Party and major media figures. According to Greg Mitchell&#x27;s 2017 article on EPIC in &quot;The Nation&quot;, opponents of EPIC &quot;organized the most lavish and creative dirty-tricks campaign ever seen—one that was to become a landmark in American politics&quot; involving &quot;turning over a major campaign to outside advertising, publicity, media and fundraising consultants for the first time.&quot;

The heads of Hollywood&#x27;s major movie studios strongly opposed EPIC, largely due to Sinclair&#x27;s proposal to hand over idle movie studio lots to unemployed film workers to make movies of their own. The studio heads reacted by threatening to move film operations to Florida and deducting money from employee paychecks to finance the campaign of Sinclair&#x27;s Republican opponent for governor, Frank Merriam. Two of California&#x27;s most influential figures in print media, William Randolph Hearst and Harry Chandler, also used their papers to support Merriam&#x27;s campaign and attack Sinclair.

In the face of this coordinated opposition, and without the backing of Roosevelt, Sinclair fell behind Merriam in the polls. On November 6, 1934, Merriam defeated Sinclair with 1,138,629 (48.9%) to Sinclair&#x27;s 879,537 (37.8%). Even in defeat, Sinclair received twice as many votes as any previous Democratic candidate for governor. In addition, two dozen candidates running on the EPIC platform were elected to the state legislature, including Culbert Olson, who became governor four years later.

==Movement==
The EPIC movement continued after Sinclair&#x27;s defeat. It &quot;recalled a mayor, kicked out a district attorney, replaced the governor with one of our choice&quot; between 1934 and 1938, according to Robert A. Heinlein, who by then was deputy publisher of the &quot;EPIC News&quot;. Heinlein also ran for the State Assembly in Hollywood and Beverly Hills in 1938. He lost, causing him to take up science fiction writing to pay off his campaign debt.

==Legacy==
Despite Sinclair&#x27;s defeat, EPIC is recognized as having been very influential in shaping Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs. In late 1934, Harry Hopkins, a senior adviser to Roosevelt who went on to oversee many New Deal programs, proposed an &quot;End Poverty in America&quot; campaign that &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote “differs from Sinclair&#x27;s plan in detail, but not in principle.”

In 2022, universal basic income advocate and former Mayor of Stockton Michael Tubbs created &quot;End Poverty in California&quot; (EPIC), a nonprofit antipoverty organization with the same name and acronym that was inspired by Sinclair&#x27;s campaign. Sinclair&#x27;s movement is thought to have been extremely influential in California&#x27;s politics, as well as a standard for Democrats and Republicans. EPIC had a substantial role in the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, eventually helping provide for the unemployed. Other administrations, such as the Farm Security Administration, continued to carry on these acts favoring the EPIC movement.

Gephardt came out to her family as a lesbian in April 2001. She had fallen in love with another woman, Loder, while in graduate school at the George Warren Brown School of Social Work. She first came to public attention when NBC announced that she was gay. She had been married to Marc Alan Leibole for three years before she fell in love with a woman, and came out to her husband and to her father. She was subsequently featured on the cover of &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

In 2003, Gephardt quit her job as a social worker to campaign for her father full-time. According to the &quot;Knight Ridder Tribune&quot;, Gephardt is the first prominent LGBT relative to promote a major political campaign in the United States. &quot;Out&quot; magazine called her inclusion &quot;a sea change in presidential campaigns: Not only are gay family members no longer considered a potential liability (see Mary Cheney), we are in fact a coveted constituency worth fighting for.&quot; In 2004, she helped start up chapters of the Stonewall Democrats in Washington, D.C. She is an activist.

Gephardt was raised in a Catholic household. She identifies as a Christian.

== Appearances ==
She appeared on the Showtime reality show &quot;American Candidate&quot; in 2004. Gephardt said that the &quot;show is giving me opportunities to express myself. I wanted to inspire gays and lesbians, women and other minority groups, and basically everybody who gets left out of the process.&quot; She also appeared on the February 1, 2007 (episode #1030), episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. She is interviewed in the 2007 documentary &quot;For the Bible Tells Me So&quot;, along with her parents, where she describes her life and the encouragement she received from her parents after coming out. The film&#x27;s director, Daniel Karslake, wanted to feature the Gephardts because her &quot;family really espouses the values of loving your children no matter what,&quot; according to &quot;Curve&quot;. Gephardt was also featured on a cover of &quot;Curve&quot; in 2007.

<text>A genizah (; , also &quot;geniza&quot;; plural: &quot;genizot&quot;[&quot;h&quot;] or &quot;genizahs&quot;) is a storage area in a Jewish synagogue or cemetery designated for the temporary storage of worn-out Hebrew-language books and papers on religious topics prior to proper cemetery burial.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;genizah&quot; comes from the Hebrew triconsonantal root &quot;g-n-z&quot;, which means &quot;to hide&quot; or &quot;to put away&quot;, from Old Median &quot;*ganza-&quot; (“depository; treasure”). The derived noun meant &#x27;hiding&#x27; and later a place where one put things, and is perhaps best translated as &quot;archive&quot; or &quot;repository&quot;.

==Description==
Genizot are temporary repositories designated for the storage of worn-out Hebrew language books and papers on religious topics prior to proper cemetery burial, it being forbidden to throw away writings containing the name of God. As even personal letters and legal contracts may open with an invocation of God, the contents of genizot have not been limited to religious materials; in practice, they have also contained writings of a secular nature, with or without the customary opening invocation, as well as writings in other Jewish languages that use the Hebrew alphabet (the Judeo-Arabic languages, Judeo-Persian, Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish).

Genizot are typically found in the attic or basement of a synagogue, but can also be in walls or buried underground. They may also be located in cemeteries.

The contents of genizot are periodically gathered solemnly and then buried in the cemetery or &quot;bet ḥayyim&quot;. Synagogues in Jerusalem buried the contents of their genizot every seventh year, as well as during a year of drought, believing that this would bring rain. This custom is associated with the far older practice of burying a great or good man with a &quot;sefer&quot; (either a book of the Tanakh, or the Mishnah, the Talmud, or any work of rabbinic literature) which has become &quot;pasul&quot; (unfit for use through illegibility or old age). The tradition of paper-interment is known to have been practiced in Morocco, Algiers, Egypt, Yemen and Turkey.

==History==
The Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 115a) directs that holy writings in other than the Hebrew language require &quot;genizah&quot;, that is, preservation. In Tractate Pesachim 118b, &quot;bet genizah&quot; is a treasury. In Pesachim 56a, Hezekiah hides (&quot;ganaz&quot;) a medical work; in Shabbat 115a, Gamaliel orders that the targum to the Book of Job should be hidden (&quot;yigganez&quot;) under the &quot;nidbak&quot; (layer of stones). In Shabbat 30b, there is a reference to those rabbis who sought to categorize the books of Ecclesiastes and Proverbs as heretical; this occurred before the canonization of the Hebrew Bible, when disputes flared over which books should be considered Biblical. The same thing occurs in Shabbat 13b in regard to the Book of Ezekiel, and in Pesachim 62 in regard to the Book of Genealogies (&quot;Sefer Yochasin&quot;, a collection of tannaitic exegesis or &quot;midrash&quot; on the Book of Chronicles).

In medieval times, Hebrew scraps and papers that were relegated to the genizah were known as &quot;shemot&quot; &#x27;names&#x27;, because their sanctity and consequent claim to preservation were held to depend on their containing the &quot;names&quot; of God. In addition to papers, articles connected with ritual, such as tzitzit, lulavim, and sprigs of myrtle, are similarly stored.

According to folklore, these scraps were used to hide the famed Golem of Prague, whose body is claimed to lie in the genizah of the Old New Synagogue in Prague.

By far, the best-known genizah, which is famous for both its size and spectacular contents, is the Cairo Geniza. Recognized for its importance and introduced to the Western world in 1864 by Jacob Saphir, and chiefly studied by Solomon Schechter, Jacob Mann and Shelomo Dov Goitein, the genizah had an accumulation of almost 280,000 Jewish manuscript fragments dating from 870 to the 19th century. These materials were important for reconstructing the religious, social and economic history of Jews, especially in the Middle Ages. For all practical purposes, the Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between the years 1946 and 1956, belonged to a genizah.

In 1927, a manuscript containing Nathan ben Abraham&#x27;s 11th-century Mishnah commentary was discovered in the genizah of the Jewish community of Sana&#x27;a, Yemen. Nathan had served as &quot;President of the Academy&quot; under the revised Palestinian &quot;geonate&quot;, shortly before its demise in the early 12th century CE. In 2011, the so-called Afghan Geniza, an 11th-century collection of manuscript fragments in Hebrew, Aramaic, Judaeo-Arabic and Judeo-Persian, was found in Afghanistan, in caves used by the Taliban.

In Germanic lands genizot have been preserved in buildings dating back to the early modern period and till today, dozens of genizot have been saved. Researchers began to study the material, soon realizing that these findings could provide insight into the life of Jewish rural communities from the 17th to 19th century. The and other researchers are dealing with the inventory, the digitization and the publication of the finds.

<text>Drunen is a town in the municipality of Heusden in southern Netherlands. The town is part of a region called the (&#x27;long road&#x27;) which is historically known for its leather and shoe industry. Since 1813, Drunen had been a separate municipality, consisting of the towns Drunen, Elshout, and Giersbergen. , Drunen&#x27;s population is 18,216.

==Built environment==
The center of Drunen is a plaza surrounded by the (&#x27;St Lambert&#x27;s church&#x27;) and city hall. A number of pubs, restaurants and stores are also located in the middle of town. 

Drunen was heavily shelled by British Forces in late 1944 in the days prior to liberation from Nazi occupation and its main buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed outright. In consequence, there are few historic buildings. In 2007 the downtown area, including the plaza, was modernized.

==Municipal merger==
On 1 January 1997, Drunen was incorporated, along with the municipalities of Heusden and Vlijmen, into the new, enlarged municipality of Heusden, containing the towns Drunen, Elshout, Giersbergen, Heesbeen, Doeveren, Hedikhuizen, Herpt, Oud-Heusden, Heusden, Vlijmen, Nieuwkuijk and Haarsteeg. Some argued that this enlarged municipality should have been called the municipality of Drunen, being the biggest of the three towns. However, due to the historical importance of Heusden, and possibly to avoid ill-will in the almost equally large town of Vlijmen, the municipality was named after Heusden.

==History==
* 1813: Drunen becomes a municipality in the Kingdom of the Netherlands
* 1935: Elshout (previously part of the municipality Oud-Heusden) is added to Drunen
* 1944: Liberation of Drunen in World War II at which the church tower and many of the historic buildings are destroyed
* 1997: The municipality of Drunen is incorporated into the enlarged municipality of Heusden
* 2007: The modernized centre of Drunen is officially opened

==Economy==
Drunen has an extensive industrial park which includes heavy industry for large ship&#x27;s propellers, as well as copper and aluminium extrusion. Most recent industries focus on logistics. The biggest employers in Drunen are the propeller factory Wärtsilä (previously John Crane Group-LIPS) and the aluminium factory of the Sapa Group (previously Alcoa).

==Recreation==
Drunen is internationally known for the National Park, (&#x27;Loon and Drunen Dunes&#x27;), consisting of dunes and forests that attracts many tourists. To emphasize the link between Drunen and the Dunes, at the opening of the modernized town center, a piece of art was unveiled which contains excerpts of a poem about the dunes.

An historic car and vehicle museum (&quot;Autotron&quot;) was located in Drunen until 1987. The building was designed by architect Anton Pieck (known from the Efteling). It is currently used as a theatre and arts facility, highlighting different music, dance and art groups. In 1987, the Autotron collection moved to Rosmalen until 2003, since when it has become part of the Louwman Museum&#x27;s collection in The Hague. 

A theme park called Land van Ooit was located in Drunen as well. However, on 22 November 2007 the park closed. Subsequently, the property of was purchased by the local government for recreational purposes and to support infrastructure.

<doc id="321242" wikidata="Q1141046" url="?curid=321242" title="Crosby, Merseyside">
<text>Crosby is a coastal town in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is north of Bootle, south of Southport and Formby, and west of Netherton. It abuts the areas of Blundellsands to the north and Waterloo to the south. It is approximately 6 
miles (9.6 km) north of Liverpool.

==History==
The town has Viking roots in common with the other &quot;-by&quot; suffixed settlements of Formby to the north and Kirkby to the east. Crosby was known as &quot;Krossabyr&quot;
in Old Norse, meaning &quot;village with the cross&quot;.
The settlement was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Crosebi&quot;, and by the year 1212 had become &quot;Crosseby&quot;. Local people are known as Crosbeians and were referred to as such in the local press but the term is little used today.

The opening of the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway in 1848 resulted in the growth of Crosby as a suburb of Liverpool.

==Governance==
Crosby formed part of the Crosby parliamentary constituency from 1950 until 2010. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Crosby from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party; prior to her election the seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished and Crosby town was divided between two constituencies, with the two electoral wards of South Crosby, Church and Victoria, containing the urbanised bulk of the town which includes the areas of Great Crosby, Waterloo and Seaforth, being absorbed into the expanded Bootle constituency, represented by the Labour MP Peter Dowd, and the two electoral wards of northern Crosby, Blundellsands and Manor, which contains residential suburban areas such as, Blundellsands, Brighton-Le-Sands, Little Crosby, Thornton, and Hightown, forming part of the new Sefton Central constituency represented by Bill Esterson, also a Labour MP.

==Administration==
Crosby became part of the municipal borough of Crosby in 1937 by the merger of the urban districts of Great Crosby and Waterloo with Seaforth, both in the administrative county of Lancashire. This borough was succeeded by the new Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside on 1 April 1974.

For elections to Sefton Council Crosby is covered by a range of council wards as detailed above: the Victoria ward, covers Great Crosby and North Waterloo, and is represented by three councillors. They are now all Labour Party councillors Michael Roche, Leslie Byrom CBE FRCIS, and Jan Grace.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Crosby, Merseyside is twinned with Capri, Italy.

==Geography==
Crosby as an area was composed of a string of settlements along the Irish Sea coast. These areas were part of the urban districts of Great Crosby and Waterloo with Seaforth and the Municipal Borough of Crosby before it too was abolished and became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton. These areas are:

*Great Crosby – The main area which gave the town and the old municipal borough its name, despite the confusion that exists, Great Crosby is not the actual town itself but is the largest area of it which was an urban district in its own right which merged with Waterloo with Seaforth urban district to form the Municipal Borough of Crosby and defined the town of Crosby in its present borders.
*Little Crosby – A small village considered to be the oldest existent Roman Catholic village in England.
*Blundellsands – An area to the north west of Great Crosby. It abuts the northern section of Crosby Beach, the location of Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot;.
*Waterloo – An area situated southwest of Great Crosby, originally known as Crosby Seabank. It includes Crosby Civic Hall and Library, and the Plaza Community Cinema. It abuts the southern section of Crosby Beach, the location of Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot;.
*Brighton-le-Sands – An area situated between Blundellsands to the north, Waterloo to the south and Great Crosby to the east.
*Thornton – A village situated to the northeast of Great Crosby.

<text>Little Crosby is a small village in the Sefton district of Merseyside, England. Despite being within 8 miles of Liverpool it has retained its rural character by, for example, opting not to have street lights. Until 1974 it was in Lancashire.

The village is perhaps the oldest extant Roman Catholic village in England, the squires being the notable recusant Blundell family. The village character has changed little from a 17th-century description that &quot;it had not a beggar, ... an alehouse ... [or] a Protestant in it...&quot;. In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 1097.

Notable attractions are:
* Crosby Hall Educational Trust (CHET) an educational, residential centre for children and young people.
* The Well Barn, an attractive courtyard which has various small shops and businesses including a jewellery shop, florist, conservationist restorer and furniture makers

The village is dominated by the St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, inspired by Augustus Pugin. Opposite the church is St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic School, a single storey 1960s building. The first school for the village was established by the Squire, William Blundell, at Boundary Cottage in 1843, next to the brook that then ran between Great Crosby and Little Crosby. In 1859 the school moved to a new building next to the presbytery of the church, opposite the current site. The current school building replaced that in 1964. The school takes pupils from the village and neighbouring villages of Hightown and Ince Blundell.

==Governance==
From 1950 until 2010 Little Crosby was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose Member of Parliament (MP)from 1997 till 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MP&#x27;s elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Little Crosby, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council Little Crosby is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.

Little Crosby was formerly a township in the parish of Sephton, in 1866 Little Crosby became a civil parish and in 1894 Little Crosby became an urban district, on 1 April 1932 the parish and urban district were abolished and merged with Great Crosby. This urban district was combined with other districts to form the municipal borough of Crosby in 1937. This in turn was absorbed into the new Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in 1974.
