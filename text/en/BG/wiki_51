<text>Daniel &quot;Dee&quot; Snider (born March 15, 1955) is an American musician, best known as the lead singer and songwriter of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister. The band&#x27;s song &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and was ranked No. 47 on 100 Greatest 80&#x27;s Songs. Snider later formed and was the lead singer in the heavy metal bands Desperado, Widowmaker, and SMFs (Sick Mutha Fuckers). He also released several solo albums. Snider was ranked #83 in the &quot;Hit Parader&quot;″s Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time.

==Early life==
Born in Astoria, Queens, New York City, on March 15, 1955, Snider was raised in nearby Freeport, New York and Baldwin, New York, both on Long Island. His father, Bob, is a retired New York State Trooper and Nassau County court clerk, and his mother, Marguerite, is a retired art teacher. His father is Jewish, whereas his mother is from a Catholic family of Swiss descent. He is also of Ukrainian descent from his grandfather. Snider and his siblings were raised as Episcopalians after his mother joined the church.

As a child, he sang in a church choir, several school choruses, and concert choir in high school. Snider was selected for the All-State Chorus for singing.
He was graduated from Baldwin Senior High School in 1973.

==Career==
===1970s–1980s===
In early 1976, Snider joined Twisted Sister and became the band&#x27;s sole songwriter. The group released their first studio album, &quot;Under the Blade&quot;, in September 1982 and developed a following in the UK. Less than a year later, Twisted Sister released their second album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Their third album, &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;, hit shelves on May 10, 1984. This became the band&#x27;s most successful record with the hits &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; reached No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, and was ranked No. 47 on 100 Greatest 80&#x27;s Songs. To emphasize the &quot;twisted sister&quot; image, Snider adopted a trademark persona of metal-inspired drag with long blond curly hair, an excessive amount of eye shadow and rouge, a beauty mark, and bright red lipstick.

During the mid-1980s, before the premiere of &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, the first MTV program to consist entirely of heavy metal videos was &quot;Heavy Metal Mania&quot;. The first episode aired in June 1985 and was hosted by Snider. It featured metal news, interviews with metal artists, and in-studio co-hosts. That same year, in November, Twisted Sister released &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, which sold more than 500,000 copies in the USA.

In 1984, Snider was arrested for obscenity after a show in Amarillo, Texas. A parent who brought their kid to the show pressed charges after Snider cursed out a member of the audience for causing trouble. A fine was paid and the charges were later dropped.

In 1985, Snider was involved in a Senate hearing instigated by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), which sought to introduce a parental warning system that would label all albums containing what they considered offensive material. Prior to the appearance by PMRC in Congress, they had singled out a list of songs entitled the &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot; to demonstrate the dangers of such material to youth, with &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; featuring on the list alongside Prince&#x27;s &quot;Darling Nikki&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, and Venom&#x27;s &quot;Possessed&quot;, among other titles. The PMRC proposed a system involving letters that identified the types of objectionable content they determined to be found in each album (e.g., &quot;O&quot; for occult themes, &quot;X&quot; for sex and profanity, &quot;D/A&quot; for drugs and alcohol, &quot;V&quot; for violence, etc.). Snider, John Denver, and Frank Zappa all testified against censorship and the proposed warning system. The system was never implemented, and the music industry had already adopted what is now the generic &quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Content&quot; label.

The PMRC involved prominent public figures such as Tipper Gore, the then-wife of Senator Al Gore (D-TN), and Susan Baker, the wife of then-Secretary of State James Baker. Tipper Gore and Snider had a publicly antagonistic relationship as a consequence, with Snider accusing her of having a &quot;dirty mind&quot; for alleging that the lyrics of &quot;Under the Blade&quot; contained sadomasochistic undertones, when in fact, they were about medical surgery. Snider also alleged during the Senate hearing that Tipper Gore had fabricated evidence concerning merchandise sold by the band when she stated that &quot;the t-shirts that kids wear&quot; featured &quot;Twisted Sister and a woman in handcuffs sort of spread-eagled&quot;. Snider challenged her to produce such a shirt, to which Al Gore clarified that &quot;the word &#x27;t-shirts&#x27; was in plural, and one of them referred to Twisted Sister and the other referred to a woman in handcuffs&quot;.

The fifth Twisted Sister album was &quot;Love Is for Suckers&quot; (1987). The record was originally planned to have been a Snider solo effort, but Atlantic Records encouraged a release under the Twisted Sister name. Touring lasted only into October 1987, and on October 12, 1987, Snider announced his departure from the band. It was during this time that Snider formed Desperado, a band featuring ex-Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr, ex-Gillan guitarist Bernie Torme, and bassist Marc Russel. The group&#x27;s only album, &quot;Ace&quot;, has never been officially released, but was heavily bootlegged on CD under the title &quot;Bloodied, but Unbowed&quot;.

===1990s===

In the 1990s, Snider formed Widowmaker with guitarist Al Pitrelli, bassist Marc Russel, and former Twisted Sister drummer Joey Franco. The quartet recorded two albums with limited underground success, titled &quot;Blood and Bullets&quot; and &quot;Stand By for Pain&quot;. In the late 1990s, Snider toured with a &quot;self-tribute&quot; band called Dee Snider&#x27;s SMFs (Sick Mutha Fuckers), sometimes featuring ex-Twisted Sister drummer A.J. Pero. The usual lineup included Snider, Derek Tailer, Charlie Mills, Keith Alexander, and Spike.

In 1993, Snider composed the theme song for &quot;The Terrible Thunderlizards&quot;. By 1994, Snider had, by his own admission: &quot;...lost every penny I made. I was riding a bicycle to a desk job for $200 a week answering phones in an office.&quot; ()

In 1997, Snider began hosting &quot;The House of Hair&quot;, a syndicated 1980s hard rock/heavy metal radio show on more than 200 radio stations across North America. It is syndicated by the United Stations Radio Networks. The show&#x27;s format runs two or three hours depending on which version of the show a radio station carries and features Snider&#x27;s closing catchphrase: &quot;If it ain&#x27;t metal, it&#x27;s crap!&quot;

In 1998, Snider penned a song entitled &quot;The Magic of Christmas Day (God Bless Us Everyone)&quot;, which Celine Dion recorded for her album &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;. According to Snider, Dion at the time was not aware of who wrote the song. Later that year, he also wrote and starred in the horror film &quot;Strangeland&quot;. Snider also penned the script to a sequel with the working title of &quot;Strangeland: Disciple&quot;.

As of January 2008, however, Snider was less than optimistic that &quot;Disciple&quot; would ever see the light of day, saying in an interview with Bullz-Eye.com that he had reached a point where he should: &quot;...put a sign on my website that says, &#x27;Y&#x27;got ten million dollars? Give me a call. I&#x27;ve got the script ready to go. Robert Englund&#x27;s attached, I&#x27;m attached. If somebody&#x27;s serious and wants to make it, call me. But don&#x27;t call me &#x27;til you&#x27;re ready to hand the check over.

In May 2009, Snider revealed on his radio show &quot;The House of Hair&quot; that &quot;Strangeland: Rising Sons&quot; would go ahead and was set to begin shooting in the fall of 2009 and would be slated for a 2010 release.

===2000–2009===

From June 1999 to August 2003, Snider hosted a morning radio show on a Hartford, Connecticut Clear Channel station, Radio 104 (104.1 FM WMRQ), called &quot;Dee Snider Radio&quot;. His show returned to the air at night in August 2004 on 93.3 WMMR in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until June 2005. He fondly referred to his listeners as his &quot;Peeps&quot;, and &quot;DEE&quot; euro stickers, printed by the station, could be seen on the bumpers of his fans&#x27; cars throughout Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Other members of the morning show included Nick Lentino, Beth Lockwood, &quot;Psycho Dan&quot; Williams, Sean Robbins, and &quot;Darkside Dave&quot; Wallace. He frequently featured high-profile guests, including Ozzy Osbourne, pro wrestler Mick Foley, and Kiss singer/bassist Gene Simmons.

In 2001, Snider was the voice of Gol Acheron, the main villain for the PlayStation 2 video game &quot;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy&quot;. The following year, he rejoined with the reunited Twisted Sister. Snider also played himself in the 2002 TV-movie &quot;&quot;. In 2003, he appeared with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger at campaign events during his drive to recall incumbent California Governor Gray Davis. Snider sang the Twisted Sister hit &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;, which was adopted by the Schwarzenegger campaign.

Snider voiced Angry Jack in the episode &quot;Shell Shocked&quot; for the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He admitted to being a massive fan of the show during an hour-long 10th anniversary documentary of the show in 2009, stating that to be asked to voice a character on the show was an absolute honor. He changed the lyrics of his famous &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; to &quot;Goofy Goober Rock&quot; for &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;.

Snider has narrated and hosted many shows and specials on VH1, film trailers, behind-the-scenes segments, and DVD special features. He was featured as the &quot;voice&quot; in the bumpers for MSNBC&#x27;s 2001/2002 &quot;Fiercely Independent&quot; branding campaign.

In 2003, Snider collaborated on a Halloween-themed project called Van Helsing&#x27;s Curse. The project&#x27;s first album, &quot;Oculus Infernum&quot;, was released by Koch Records and featured a blend of heavy metal and orchestral elements in the style of Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The band began touring in 2004 and later released a DVD of the concert entitled &quot;Live in Philly &#x27;05&quot;.

Snider returned to radio in June 2006 with Fangoria Radio on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 102 from 9–12 Eastern.

Snider hosted VH1&#x27;s 2008 &quot;Aftermath&quot; concert in remembrance of the victims and survivors of the 2003 Station nightclub fire. During the winter of 2008, Snider was featured as a contestant on CMT&#x27;s &quot;Gone Country&quot;. The show invited musical celebrities to compete against each other to win the chance to release a country song. In 2008 Snider also appeared on the first episode of &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; (Season 2), chosen by Gordon Ramsay as part of the marketing for the re-launch of the Handlebar restaurant. On the show, Snider donated a motorcycle on which Handlebar clientele could bid via the restaurant&#x27;s website.

Snider has hosted &quot;Dead Art&quot; on Gallery HD, a show about cemeteries&#x27; beauty and art.

Snider has also hosted &quot;House of Hair&quot;, a radio show that plays heavy metal music. Snider has made appearances on the IFC Channel&#x27;s original series &quot;Z Rock&quot; as himself playing the character of a &quot;rock guru&quot;.

===2010–2019===
On July 27, 2010, Snider and his family began appearing in the reality television show &quot;Growing Up Twisted,&quot; airing on the Arts and Entertainment Network.
On October 8, 2010, Snider started an 11-week run in the cast of &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; as Dennis, the owner of The Bourbon Room, with his official start date being October 11.

In 2011, Snider performed with Ohio-based metalcore band Attack Attack! on stage at the Bamboozle Festival playing their song &quot;Turbo Swag&quot;. On the May 15, 2011 episode of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, Snider appeared to assist John Rich with his final challenge. He starred in a commercial featuring a mock audition where he came on as himself, and after drinking a soda turns into the lead singer from Twisted Sister (himself). Snider agreed to come because he is personal friends with Rich and wanted to support the charity effort for St. Jude Medical Center.

Snider guest starred in the video for &quot;Immaculate Misconception&quot; by the metalcore band Motionless in White. Snider&#x27;s son, Cody Blue Snider, directed the video.
Snider and his family appeared on &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; January 10, 2012. His wife Suzette traded places with Flavor Flav&#x27;s long-time fiancée Liz.

On the Valentine&#x27;s Day 2012 taping of &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Snider partnered with Donald Trump in a skit based upon the format of the TV game show, &quot;Password&quot;. On February 19, 2012, Snider began appearing as one of 18 contestants vying to become Trump&#x27;s next &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; and was fired after the eighth task during the seventh episode.

In 2012, Snider appeared as the main character of a commercial airing for the company Unibet. The video has been broadcast on commercial Norwegian television from March 5, 2012, through the whole summer. In the spot Snider sings, in his distinctive look as leader of Twisted Sister, a rock song called &quot;Bet&quot;, written by Snider himself and composed by the Norwegian heavy metal artist Ronni Le Tekrø.

Snider asked Republican vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan&#x27;s camp not to play his hit song in their campaign.

On September 6, 2012, Snider performed &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. Also in 2012, Snider played Larry, the owner of a dive bar in the mockumentary &quot;Future Folk&quot; about an alien bluegrass band.

On January 24, 2013, at the City National Grove of Anaheim, Snider was honored as roastee at the &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot;/&quot;Guitar World&quot; Rock and Roll Roast of Dee Snider.

On November 4, 2014, Snider debuted his original Christmas musical, &quot;Dee Snider&#x27;s Rock and Roll Christmas Tale&quot;, at the Broadway Playhouse in Chicago. During the 2015 Christmas season, he took the musical to Toronto.

Snider provided the narration for &quot;Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie&quot;, which is a documentary film directed by Drew Fortier about the 1980s hard rock band Bang Tango.

===2020–present===
On May 27, 2021, Snider announced his new upcoming solo album &quot;Leave A Scar&quot;. He also released the single &quot;I Gotta Rock (Again)&quot; which he described as the &quot;driving motivation&quot; and &quot;starting gun for this album&quot;. &quot;Leave A Scar&quot; will be produced by Jamey Jasta, the lead singer of the band Hatebreed, with mixing and mastering done by Nick Bellmore. The album features guest appearances by Cannibal Corpse&#x27;s singer Corpsegrinder on the track &quot;Time To Choose&quot;. Music videos were released for the songs &quot;I Gotta Rock (Again)&quot;, &quot;Down But Never Out&quot;, and &quot;Time To Choose&quot;. The album was released on July 30, 2021.

In 2023, Snider competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Doll&quot;. After besting George Wendt as &quot;Moose&quot; and Christine Quinn of &quot;Selling Sunset&quot; as &quot;Scorpio&quot; on &quot;&#x27;80s Night&quot;, he was eliminated on &quot;WB Movie Night&quot;. Snider also did &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; as an encore.

== Uses of &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; ==
On July 11, 2013, after abortion rights activists sang &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; to protest legal restrictions on abortion in Texas, Snider tweeted that he is &quot;pro-choice&quot;, and that he did not believe that being Christian and &quot;pro-choice&quot; were mutually exclusive of one another.

In 2016, Snider recorded a piano ballad version of &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; for Criss Angel&#x27;s charity HELP (Heal Every Life Angel Possible) to raise money for pediatric cancer treatment and research. Angel directed the video.

In the wake of teachers&#x27; strikes in West Virginia and Oklahoma, Snider dedicated &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; to teachers during his &quot;Rocktopia&quot; performance at the Broadway Theatre in New York on April 9, 2018. The song had become an anthem for protesting teachers in West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and elsewhere, and Snider had tweeted his &quot;support [of the] underpaid teacher&#x27;s cause&quot; after seeing a video of music teachers in Oklahoma performing the song.

In 2021, Snider objected to the use of the song by demonstrators in Fort Lauderdale protesting face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Snider approved the use of &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; by the Ukrainians.

In November 2023, when asked after the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel whether he was okay with Israeli soldiers using his band&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; as a battle cry, Snider replied: &quot;Oh, hell yeah. You know what? Israelis, the assault on the Israelis, people are losing sight of something. People saying that, &#x27;Oh, the response is gonna be too intense for what happened.&#x27; Well, you don&#x27;t get to decide on the response when you do heinous things to civilians. You don&#x27;t get to say, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s enough, that&#x27;s enough retaliation.&#x27; No, it doesn&#x27;t work like that. When you cross that line, you&#x27;re burning people, you&#x27;re slaughtering people, you&#x27;re raping people, you&#x27;re just killing people, after what happened at that festival you don&#x27;t get to say, &#x27;Okay, your revenge can be this much.&#x27; No. Payback&#x27;s a mothereffer. And I come from that school. You cross that line, you know… Sh*t&#x27;s gonna happen. Sing it out, boys.&quot;

==Personal life==
Snider has been married to his wife Suzette, a costume designer, since 1981. They have four children, Jesse Blaze Snider (born September 19, 1982), Shane Royal Snider (born February 29, 1988), Cody Blue Snider (born December 7, 1989), and Cheyenne Jean Snider (born October 31, 1996) who was in the band They All Float. He also has four grandchildren.

In the 1985 Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) Senate hearings, Snider stated: &quot;I was born and raised a Christian, and I still adhere to those principles.&quot;

In 2003, Snider&#x27;s brother-in-law, Vincent Gargiulo, was murdered. The killer was apprehended in 2009.

Snider lived part-time in East Setauket, New York. He appeared on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; in 2005 to show his Long Island home, along with two of his four children, Shane and Cheyenne.

In 2008, he stated in a TMZ interview that he would be voting for Barack Obama because John McCain (whom he liked and supported for many years) would not acknowledge the &quot;mistakes&quot; George W. Bush had made while in office.

<text>Adam Murimuth (1274/751347) was an English ecclesiastic and chronicler.

==Life==
He was born in 1274 or 1275 and studied civil law at the University of Oxford. Between 1312 and 1318 he practised in the papal curia at Avignon. King Edward II of England and Archbishop Robert Winchelsey were among his clients, and his legal services secured for him canonries at Hereford and St Paul&#x27;s, and the precentorship of Exeter Cathedral. In 1331 he retired to country living (in Wraysbury, Buckinghamshire), and devoted himself to writing the history of his own times.

==Works==
The chronicle he wrote of his times is entitled &quot;Chronicon, sive res gestae sui temporis quibus ipse interfuit, res Romanas et Gallicas Anglicanis intertexens, 1302-1343&quot; (Cottonian Library MSS., Claudius E VIII). His &quot;Continuatio chronicarum&quot;, begun not earlier than 1325, starts from the year 1303, and continues up to 1347, the year of his death. Meagre at first, it becomes fuller about 1340 and is specially valuable for the history of the French wars. Murimuth gives a bald narrative of events, incorporating many documents in the latter part of his book. The annals of St. Paul&#x27;s edited by Bishop William Stubbs are closely related to the work of Murimuth, but probably not from his pen. The &quot;Continuatio&quot; was carried on, after his death, by an anonymous writer to the year 1380.

The only complete edition of the &quot;Continuatio chronicarum&quot; is that by Edward Maunde Thompson (Rolls series, 1889). The preface to this edition, and to William Stubbs&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Edward I and II&quot;, vol. i. (Rolls series, 1882), should be consulted. The anonymous continuation is printed in Thomas Hog&#x27;s edition of &quot;Murimuth&quot; (Eng. Hist. Soc., London, 1846).

<text>Count Gustav Gustavsson of Vasaborg, 1st Count of [[Uusikaupunki|Nystad]] (24 April 1616 – 25 October 1653) was a Swedish noble and military officer.

==Biography== 
He was a son of King Gustavus Adolphus (&quot;Gustav II Adolf&quot;) and his mistress Margareta Slots.
In 1626 he was enrolled at Uppsala University. In 1633, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Gustav entered the Swedish military service and the next year was appointed Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück. In 1637 he was ennobled with the title of Vasaborg, echoing his father&#x27;s membership of the House of Vasa. In 1647 he was made Count of Nystad in the Swedish nobility and in 1648 received Wildeshausen in Lower Saxony as his own fief, after it had been won by Sweden at the Peace of Westphalia of that year. He was married to Countess Anna Sofia Wied-Runkel, who long outlived him, dying in 1694.
In 1649 Gustav unsuccessfully sought the position of Lord High Admiral in succession to Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, an illegitimate son of his grandfather King Charles IX. Dissatisfied with the outcome, he returned to Lower Saxony and died there at Wildeshausen. His body was brought back to Sweden for burial at Riddarholmskyrkan in Stockholm.

<doc id="315006" wikidata="Q951060" url="?curid=315006" title="The Structure of Scientific Revolutions">
<text>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is a book about the history of science by the philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as &quot;development-by-accumulation&quot; of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of conceptual continuity and cumulative progress, referred to as periods of &quot;normal science&quot;, were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of &quot;anomalies&quot; accumulating and precipitating revolutions in science leads to new paradigms. New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere &quot;puzzle-solving&quot; of the previous paradigm, alter the rules of the game and change the &quot;map&quot; directing new research.

For example, Kuhn&#x27;s analysis of the Copernican Revolution emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the Ptolemaic system, but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler solutions that might be developed at some point in the future. Kuhn called the core concepts of an ascendant revolution its &quot;paradigms&quot; and thereby launched this word into widespread analogical use in the second half of the 20th century. Kuhn&#x27;s insistence that a paradigm shift was a mélange of sociology, enthusiasm and scientific promise, but not a logically determinate procedure, caused an uproar in reaction to his work. Kuhn addressed concerns in the 1969 postscript to the second edition. For some commentators &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; introduced a realistic humanism into the core of science, while for others the nobility of science was tarnished by Kuhn&#x27;s introduction of an irrational element into the heart of its greatest achievements.

==History==
&quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; was first published as a monograph in the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;, then as a book by University of Chicago Press in 1962. In 1969, Kuhn added a postscript to the book in which he replied to critical responses to the first edition. A 50th Anniversary Edition (with an introductory essay by Ian Hacking) was published by the University of Chicago Press in April 2012.

Kuhn dated the genesis of his book to 1947, when he was a graduate student at Harvard University and had been asked to teach a science class for humanities undergraduates with a focus on historical case studies. Kuhn later commented that until then, &quot;I&#x27;d never read an old document in science.&quot; Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; was astonishingly unlike Isaac Newton&#x27;s work in its concepts of matter and motion. Kuhn wrote: &quot;as I was reading him, Aristotle appeared not only ignorant of mechanics, but a dreadfully bad physical scientist as well. About motion, in particular, his writings seemed to me full of egregious errors, both of logic and of observation.&quot; This was in an apparent contradiction with the fact that Aristotle was a brilliant mind. While perusing Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;, Kuhn formed the view that in order to properly appreciate Aristotle&#x27;s reasoning, one must be aware of the scientific conventions of the time. Kuhn concluded that Aristotle&#x27;s concepts were not &quot;bad Newton,&quot; just different. This insight was the foundation of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.

Central ideas regarding the process of scientific investigation and discovery had been anticipated by Ludwik Fleck in . Fleck had developed the first system of the sociology of scientific knowledge. He claimed that the exchange of ideas led to the establishment of a thought collective, which, when developed sufficiently, separated the field into esoteric (professional) and exoteric (laymen) circles. Kuhn wrote the foreword to the 1979 edition of Fleck&#x27;s book, noting that he read it in 1950 and was reassured that someone &quot;saw in the history of science what I myself was finding there.&quot;

Kuhn was not confident about how his book would be received. Harvard University had denied his tenure a few years prior. By the mid-1980s, however, his book had achieved blockbuster status. When Kuhn&#x27;s book came out in the early 1960s, &quot;structure&quot; was an intellectually popular word in many fields in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics and anthropology, appealing in its idea that complex phenomena could reveal or be studied through basic, simpler structures. Kuhn&#x27;s book contributed to that idea.

One theory to which Kuhn replies directly is Karl Popper&#x27;s &quot;falsificationism,&quot; which stresses falsifiability as the most important criterion for distinguishing between that which is scientific and that which is unscientific. Kuhn also addresses verificationism, a philosophical movement that emerged in the 1920s among logical positivists. The verifiability principle claims that meaningful statements must be supported by empirical evidence or logical requirements.

==Synopsis==

===Basic approach===
Kuhn&#x27;s approach to the history and philosophy of science addresses conceptual issues like the practice of normal science, influence of historical events, emergence of scientific discoveries, nature of scientific revolutions and progress through scientific revolutions. What sorts of intellectual options and strategies were available to people during a given period? What types of lexicons and terminology were known and employed during certain epochs? Stressing the importance of not attributing traditional thought to earlier investigators, Kuhn&#x27;s book argues that the evolution of scientific theory does not emerge from the straightforward accumulation of facts, but rather from a set of changing intellectual circumstances and possibilities.

Kuhn did not see scientific theory as proceeding linearly from an objective, unbiased accumulation of all available data, but rather as paradigm-driven:
===Historical examples of chemistry===
Kuhn explains his ideas using examples taken from the history of science. For instance, eighteenth-century scientists believed that homogenous solutions were chemical compounds. Therefore, a combination of water and alcohol was generally classified as a &quot;compound&quot;. Nowadays it is considered to be a &quot;solution&quot;, but there was no reason then to suspect that it was not a compound. Water and alcohol would not separate spontaneously, nor will they separate completely upon distillation (they form an azeotrope). Water and alcohol can be combined in any proportion.

Under this paradigm, scientists believed that chemical reactions (such as the combination of water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory, which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this new paradigm, any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion could not be a chemical process. This type of world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn&#x27;s paradigm shift.

===Copernican Revolution===

A famous example of a revolution in scientific thought is the Copernican Revolution. In Ptolemy&#x27;s school of thought, cycles and epicycles (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling the movements of the planets in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As accuracy of celestial observations increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. Copernicus proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus&#x27; model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and due to a lack of accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus&#x27; contemporaries rejected his cosmology, and Kuhn asserts that they were quite right to do so: Copernicus&#x27; cosmology lacked credibility.

Kuhn illustrates how a paradigm shift later became possible when Galileo Galilei introduced his new ideas concerning motion. Intuitively, when an object is set in motion, it soon comes to a halt. A well-made cart may travel a long distance before it stops, but unless something keeps pushing it, it will eventually stop moving. Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.

Galileo put forward a bold alternative conjecture: suppose, he said, that we always observe objects coming to a halt simply because some friction is always occurring. Galileo had no equipment with which to objectively confirm his conjecture, but he suggested that without any friction to slow down an object in motion, its inherent tendency is to maintain its speed without the application of any additional force.

The Ptolemaic approach of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: there seemed to be no end to the mushrooming growth in complexity required to account for the observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler was the first person to abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet&#x27;s angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.

Galileo&#x27;s conjecture was merely that – a conjecture. So was Kepler&#x27;s cosmology. But each conjecture increased the credibility of the other, and together, they changed the prevailing perceptions of the scientific community. Later, Newton showed that Kepler&#x27;s three laws could all be derived from a single theory of motion and planetary motion. Newton solidified and unified the paradigm shift that Galileo and Kepler had initiated.

===Coherence===
One of the aims of science is to find models that will account for as many observations as possible within a coherent framework. Together, Galileo&#x27;s rethinking of the nature of motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a coherent framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.

Once a paradigm shift has taken place, the textbooks are rewritten. Often the history of science too is rewritten, being presented as an inevitable process leading up to the current, established framework of thought. There is a prevalent belief that all hitherto-unexplained phenomena will in due course be accounted for in terms of this established framework. Kuhn states that scientists spend most (if not all) of their careers in a process of puzzle-solving. Their puzzle-solving is pursued with great tenacity, because the previous successes of the established paradigm tend to generate great confidence that the approach being taken guarantees that a solution to the puzzle exists, even though it may be very hard to find. Kuhn calls this process &quot;normal science&quot;.

As a paradigm is stretched to its limits, &quot;anomalies&quot; – failures of the current paradigm to take into account observed phenomena – accumulate. Their significance is judged by the practitioners of the discipline. Some anomalies may be dismissed as errors in observation, others as merely requiring small adjustments to the current paradigm that will be clarified in due course. Some anomalies resolve themselves spontaneously, having increased the available depth of insight along the way. But no matter how great or numerous the anomalies that persist, Kuhn observes, the practicing scientists will not lose faith in the established paradigm until a credible alternative is available; to lose faith in the solvability of the problems would in effect mean ceasing to be a scientist.

In any community of scientists, Kuhn states, there are some individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a &quot;crisis&quot; exists, embark on what Kuhn calls &quot;revolutionary science&quot;, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate paradigm will appear to be accompanied by numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. Kuhn cites, as an example, that Alexis Clairaut, in 1750, was able to account accurately for the precession of the Moon&#x27;s orbit using Newtonian theory, after sixty years of failed attempts. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new paradigm will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory&#x27;s potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging paradigm. There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms. In time, if the challenging paradigm is solidified and unified, it will replace the old paradigm, and a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; will have occurred.

===Phases===
Kuhn explains the process of scientific change as the result of various phases of paradigm change.

* Phase 1 – It exists only once and is the &quot;pre-paradigm phase&quot;, in which there is no consensus on any particular theory. This phase is characterized by several incompatible and incomplete theories. Consequently, most scientific inquiry takes the form of lengthy books, as there is no common body of facts that may be taken for granted. When the actors in the pre-paradigm community eventually gravitate to one of these conceptual frameworks and ultimately to a widespread consensus on the appropriate choice of methods, terminology and on the kinds of experiment that are likely to contribute to increased insights, the old schools of thought disappear. The new paradigm leads to a more rigid definition of the research field, and those who are reluctant or unable to adapt are isolated or have to join rival groups.
* Phase 2 – Normal science begins, in which puzzles are solved within the context of the dominant paradigm. As long as there is consensus within the discipline, normal science continues. Over time, progress in normal science may reveal anomalies, facts that are difficult to explain within the context of the existing paradigm. While usually these anomalies are resolved, in some cases they may accumulate to the point where normal science becomes difficult and where weaknesses in the old paradigm are revealed.
* Phase 3 – If the paradigm proves chronically unable to account for anomalies, the community enters a crisis period. Crises are often resolved within the context of normal science. However, after significant efforts of normal science within a paradigm fail, science may enter the next phase.
* Phase 4 – Paradigm shift, or scientific revolution, is the phase in which the underlying assumptions of the field are reexamined and a new paradigm is established.
* Phase 5 – Post-revolution, the new paradigm&#x27;s dominance is established and so scientists return to normal science, solving puzzles within the new paradigm.

A science may go through these cycles repeatedly, though Kuhn notes that it is a good thing for science that such shifts do not occur often or easily.

===Incommensurability===
According to Kuhn, the scientific paradigms preceding and succeeding a paradigm shift are so different that their theories are incommensurable—the new paradigm cannot be proven or disproven by the rules of the old paradigm, and vice versa. (A later interpretation by Kuhn of &quot;commensurable&quot; versus &quot;incommensurable&quot; was as a distinction between &quot;languages&quot;, namely, that statements in commensurable languages were translatable fully from one to the other, while in &quot;in&quot;commensurable languages, strict translation is not possible. The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.
Such incommensurability exists not just before and after a paradigm shift, but in the periods in between conflicting paradigms. It is simply not possible, according to Kuhn, to construct an impartial language that can be used to perform a neutral comparison between conflicting paradigms, because the very terms used are integral to the respective paradigms, and therefore have different connotations in each paradigm. The advocates of mutually exclusive paradigms are in a difficult position: &quot;Though each may hope to convert the other to his way of seeing science and its problems, neither may hope to prove his case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle that can be resolved by proofs.&quot; Scientists subscribing to different paradigms end up talking past one another.

Kuhn states that the probabilistic tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall under one of the paradigms they are supposed to help compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.

Kuhn further developed his ideas regarding incommensurability in the 1980s and 1990s. In his unpublished manuscript &quot;The Plurality of Worlds&quot;, Kuhn introduces the theory of &quot;kind concepts:&quot; sets of interrelated concepts that are characteristic of a time period in a science and differ in structure from the modern analogous kind concepts. These different structures imply different &quot;taxonomies&quot; of things and processes, and this difference in taxonomies constitutes incommensurability. This theory is strongly naturalistic and draws on developmental psychology to &quot;found a quasi-transcendental theory of experience and of reality.&quot;

===Exemplar===
Kuhn introduced the concept of an exemplar in a postscript to the second edition of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term &quot;exemplars&quot; for &quot;paradigm&quot;, meaning the problems and solutions that students of a subject learn from the beginning of their education. For example, physicists might have as exemplars the inclined plane, Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, or instruments like the calorimeter.

According to Kuhn, scientific practice alternates between periods of normal science and revolutionary science. During periods of normalcy, scientists tend to subscribe to a large body of interconnecting knowledge, methods, and assumptions which make up the reigning paradigm (see paradigm shift). Normal science presents a series of problems that are solved as scientists explore their field. The solutions to some of these problems become well known and are the exemplars of the field.

Those who study a scientific discipline are expected to know its exemplars. There is no fixed set of exemplars, but for a physicist today it would probably include the harmonic oscillator from mechanics and the hydrogen atom from quantum mechanics.

==Kuhn on scientific progress==
The first edition of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; ended with a chapter titled &quot;Progress through Revolutions&quot;, in which Kuhn spelled out his views on the nature of scientific progress. Since he considered &quot;problem solving&quot; (or &quot;puzzle solving&quot;) to be a central element of science, Kuhn saw that for a new candidate paradigm to be accepted by a scientific community,
In the second edition, Kuhn added a postscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the nature of scientific progress. He described a thought experiment involving an observer who has the opportunity to inspect an assortment of theories, each corresponding to a single stage in a succession of theories. What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that it will be possible to reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories&#x27; scope and content, because the more recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: &quot;That is not a relativist&#x27;s position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress.&quot;

==Influence and reception==
&quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; has been credited with producing the kind of &quot;paradigm shift&quot; Kuhn discussed. Since the book&#x27;s publication, over one million copies have been sold, including translations into sixteen different languages. In 1987, it was reported to be the twentieth-century book most frequently cited in the period 1976–1983 in the arts and the humanities.

=== Philosophy ===
The first extensive review of &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; was authored by Dudley Shapere, a philosopher who interpreted Kuhn&#x27;s work as a continuation of the anti-positivist sentiment of other philosophers of science, including Paul Feyerabend and Norwood Russell Hanson. Shapere noted the book&#x27;s influence on the philosophical landscape of the time, calling it &quot;a sustained attack on the prevailing image of scientific change as a linear process of ever-increasing knowledge&quot;. According to the philosopher Michael Ruse, Kuhn discredited the ahistorical and prescriptive approach to the philosophy of science of Ernest Nagel&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Science&quot; (1961). Kuhn&#x27;s book sparked a historicist &quot;revolt against positivism&quot; (the so-called &quot;historical turn in philosophy of science&quot; which looked to the history of science as a source of data for developing a philosophy of science), although this may not have been Kuhn&#x27;s intention; in fact, he had already approached the prominent positivist Rudolf Carnap about having his work published in the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Unified Science&quot;. The philosopher Robert C. Solomon noted that Kuhn&#x27;s views have often been suggested to have an affinity to those of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Kuhn&#x27;s view of scientific knowledge, as expounded in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, has been compared to the views of the philosopher Michel Foucault.

=== Sociology ===
The first field to claim descent from Kuhn&#x27;s ideas was the sociology of scientific knowledge. Sociologists working within this new field, including Harry Collins and Steven Shapin, used Kuhn&#x27;s emphasis on the role of non-evidential community factors in scientific development to argue against logical empiricism, which discouraged inquiry into the social aspects of scientific communities. These sociologists expanded upon Kuhn&#x27;s ideas, arguing that scientific judgment is determined by social factors, such as professional interests and political ideologies.

Barry Barnes detailed the connection between the sociology of scientific knowledge and Kuhn in his book &quot;T. S. Kuhn and Social Science&quot;. In particular, Kuhn&#x27;s ideas regarding science occurring within an established framework informed Barnes&#x27;s own ideas regarding finitism, a theory wherein meaning is continuously changed (even during periods of normal science) by its usage within the social framework.

&quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; elicited a number of reactions from the broader sociological community. Following the book&#x27;s publication, some sociologists expressed the belief that the field of sociology had not yet developed a unifying paradigm, and should therefore strive towards homogenization. Others argued that the field was in the midst of normal science, and speculated that a new revolution would soon emerge. Some sociologists, including John Urry, doubted that Kuhn&#x27;s theory, which addressed the development of natural science, was necessarily relevant to sociological development.

=== Economics ===
Developments in the field of economics are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, neoclassical economists have claimed &quot;to be at the second stage [normal science], and to have been there for a very long time – since Adam Smith, according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or Jevons according to others (Hutchison, 1978)&quot;. In the 1970s, post-Keynesian economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.

While perhaps less explicit, Kuhn&#x27;s influence remains apparent in recent economics. For instance, the abstract of Olivier Blanchard&#x27;s paper &quot;The State of Macro&quot; (2008) begins:
=== Political science ===
In 1974, &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; was ranked as the second most frequently used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn&#x27;s theory has been used by political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientist constituted a theory, or something else.

The changes that occur in politics, society and business are often expressed in Kuhnian terms, however poor their parallel with the practice of science may seem to scientists and historians of science. The terms &quot;paradigm&quot; and &quot;paradigm shift&quot; have become such notorious clichés and buzzwords that they are sometimes viewed as effectively devoid of content.

==Criticisms==

&quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; was soon criticized by Kuhn&#x27;s colleagues in the history and philosophy of science. In 1965, a special symposium on the book was held at an International Colloquium on the Philosophy of Science that took place at Bedford College, London, and was chaired by Karl Popper. The symposium led to the publication of the symposium&#x27;s presentations plus other essays, most of them critical, which eventually appeared in an influential volume of essays. Kuhn expressed the opinion that his critics&#x27; readings of his book were so inconsistent with his own understanding of it that he was &quot;tempted to posit the existence of two Thomas Kuhns,&quot; one the author of his book, the other the individual who had been criticized in the symposium by Professors Popper, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Toulmin and Watkins.

A number of the included essays question the existence of normal science. In his essay, Feyerabend suggests that Kuhn&#x27;s conception of normal science fits organized crime as well as it does science. Popper expresses distaste with the entire premise of Kuhn&#x27;s book, writing, &quot;the idea of turning for enlightenment concerning the aims of science, and its possible progress, to sociology or to psychology (or ... to the history of science) is surprising and disappointing.&quot;

===Concept of paradigm===
Stephen Toulmin defined paradigm as &quot;the set of common beliefs and agreements shared between scientists about how problems should be understood and addressed&quot;. In his 1972 work, &quot;Human Understanding&quot;, he argued that a more realistic picture of science than that presented in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; would admit the fact that revisions in science take place much more frequently, and are much less dramatic than can be explained by the model of revolution/normal science. In Toulmin&#x27;s view, such revisions occur quite often during periods of what Kuhn would call &quot;normal science&quot;. For Kuhn to explain such revisions in terms of the non-paradigmatic puzzle solutions of normal science, he would need to delineate what is perhaps an implausibly sharp distinction between paradigmatic and non-paradigmatic science.

===Incommensurability of paradigms===
In a series of texts published in the early 1970s, Carl R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this made it impossible to explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to admit the existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they admit the discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.

Kordig maintains that there is a common observational plane. For example, when Kepler and Tycho Brahe are trying to explain the relative variation of the distance of the sun from the horizon at sunrise, both see the same thing (the same configuration is focused on the retina of each individual). This is just one example of the fact that &quot;rival scientific theories share some observations, and therefore some meanings&quot;. Kordig suggests that with this approach, he is not reintroducing the distinction between observations and theory in which the former is assigned a privileged and neutral status, but that it is possible to affirm more simply the fact that, even if no sharp distinction exists between theory and observations, this does not imply that there are no comprehensible differences at the two extremes of this polarity.

At a secondary level, for Kordig there is a common plane of inter-paradigmatic standards or shared norms that permit the effective confrontation of rival theories.

In 1973, Hartry Field published an article that also sharply criticized Kuhn&#x27;s idea of incommensurability. In particular, he took issue with this passage from Kuhn:
Field takes this idea of incommensurability between the same terms in different theories one step further. Instead of attempting to identify a persistence of the reference of terms in different theories, Field&#x27;s analysis emphasizes the indeterminacy of reference within individual theories. Field takes the example of the term &quot;mass&quot;, and asks what exactly &quot;mass&quot; means in modern post-relativistic physics. He finds that there are at least two different definitions:

# Relativistic mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since the total energy of a particle in relation to one system of reference differs from the total energy in relation to other systems of reference, while the speed of light remains constant in all systems, it follows that the mass of a particle has different values in different systems of reference.
# &quot;Real&quot; mass: the mass of a particle is equal to the &quot;non-kinetic&quot; energy of a particle divided by the speed of light squared. Since non-kinetic energy is the same in all systems of reference, and the same is true of light, it follows that the mass of a particle has the same value in all systems of reference.

Projecting this distinction backwards in time onto Newtonian dynamics, we can formulate the following two hypotheses:

* HR: the term &quot;mass&quot; in Newtonian theory denotes relativistic mass.
* Hp: the term &quot;mass&quot; in Newtonian theory denotes &quot;real&quot; mass.

According to Field, it is impossible to decide which of these two affirmations is true. Prior to the theory of relativity, the term &quot;mass&quot; was &quot;referentially indeterminate&quot;. But this does not mean that the term &quot;mass&quot; did not have a different &quot;meaning&quot; than it now has. The problem is not one of meaning but of &quot;reference&quot;. The reference of such terms as mass is only &quot;partially determined&quot;: we do not really know how Newton intended his use of this term to be applied. As a consequence, neither of the two terms fully denotes (refers). It follows that it is improper to maintain that a term has changed its reference during a scientific revolution; it is more appropriate to describe terms such as &quot;mass&quot; as &quot;having undergone a denotional refinement&quot;.

In 1974, Donald Davidson objected that the concept of incommensurable scientific paradigms competing with each other is logically inconsistent. In his article Davidson goes well beyond the semantic version of the incommensurability thesis: to make sense of the idea of a language independent of translation requires a distinction between conceptual schemes and the content organized by such schemes. But, Davidson argues, no coherent sense can be made of the idea of a conceptual scheme, and therefore no sense may be attached to the idea of an untranslatable language.&quot;

===Incommensurability and perception===
The close connection between the interpretationalist hypothesis and a holistic conception of beliefs is at the root of the notion of the dependence of perception on theory, a central concept in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Kuhn maintained that the perception of the world depends on how the percipient &quot;conceives&quot; the world: two scientists who witness the same phenomenon and are steeped in two radically different theories will see two different things. According to this view, our interpretation of the world determines what we see.

Jerry Fodor attempts to establish that this theoretical paradigm is fallacious and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.

In epistemology, for example, the criticism of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then it is possible to maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is that it is necessary to distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While it is beyond doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.

Other critics, such as Israel Scheffler, Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke, have focused on the Fregean distinction between sense and reference in order to defend scientific realism. Scheffler contends that Kuhn confuses the meanings of terms such as &quot;mass&quot; with their referents. While their meanings may very well differ, their referents (the objects or entities to which they correspond in the external world) remain fixed.

==Subsequent commentary by Kuhn==
In 1995 Kuhn argued that the Darwinian metaphor in the book should have been taken more seriously than it had been.

<text>Magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) is a type of non-volatile random-access memory which stores data in magnetic domains. Developed in the mid-1980s, proponents have argued that magnetoresistive RAM will eventually surpass competing technologies to become a dominant or even universal memory. Currently, memory technologies in use such as flash RAM and DRAM have practical advantages that have so far kept MRAM in a niche role in the market.

==Description==

Unlike conventional RAM chip technologies, data in MRAM is not stored as electric charge or current flows, but by magnetic storage elements. The elements are formed from two ferromagnetic plates, each of which can hold a magnetization, separated by a thin insulating layer. One of the two plates is a permanent magnet set to a particular polarity; the other plate&#x27;s magnetization can be changed to match that of an external field to store memory. This configuration is known as a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) and is the simplest structure for an MRAM bit. A memory device is built from a grid of such &quot;cells&quot;.

The simplest method of reading is accomplished by measuring the electrical resistance of the cell. A particular cell is (typically) selected by powering an associated transistor that switches current from a supply line through the cell to ground. Because of tunnel magnetoresistance, the electrical resistance of the cell changes with the relative orientation of the magnetization in the two plates. By measuring the resulting current, the resistance inside any particular cell can be determined, and from this the magnetization polarity of the writable plate. Typically if the two plates have the same magnetization alignment (low resistance state) this is considered to mean &quot;1&quot;, while if the alignment is antiparallel the resistance will be higher (high resistance state) and this means &quot;0&quot;.

Data is written to the cells using a variety of means. In the simplest &quot;classic&quot; design, each cell lies between a pair of write lines arranged at right angles to each other, parallel to the cell, one above and one below the cell. When current is passed through them, an induced magnetic field is created at the junction, which the writable plate picks up. This pattern of operation is similar to magnetic-core memory, a system commonly used in the 1960s.

However, due to process and material variations, an array of memory cells has a distribution of switching fields with a deviation σ. Therefore, to program all the bits in a large array with the same current, the applied field needs to be larger than the mean &quot;selected&quot; switching field by greater than 6σ. In addition,the applied field must be kept below a maximum value. Thus, this &quot;conventional&quot; MRAM must keep these two distributions well-separated. As a result, there is a narrow operating window for programming fields; and only inside this window, can all the bits be programmed without errors or disturbs. In 2005, a &quot;Savtchenko switching&quot; relying on the unique behavior of a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) free layer is applied to solve this problem. The SAF layer is formed from two ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic coupling spacer layer. For a synthetic antiferromagnet having some net anisotropy Hk in each layer, there exists a critical spin flop field Hsw at which the two antiparallel layer magnetizations will rotate (flop) to be orthogonal to the applied field H with each layer scissoring slightly in the direction of H. Therefore, if only a single line current is applied (half-selected bits), the 45° field angle cannot switch the state. Below the toggling transition, there are no disturbs all the way up to the highest fields.

This approach still requires a fairly substantial current to generate the field, however, which makes it less interesting for low-power uses, one of MRAM&#x27;s primary disadvantages. Additionally, as the device is scaled down in size, there comes a time when the induced field overlaps adjacent cells over a small area, leading to potential false writes. This problem, the half-select (or write disturb) problem, appears to set a fairly large minimal size for this type of cell. One experimental solution to this problem was to use circular domains written and read using the giant magnetoresistive effect, but it appears that this line of research is no longer active.

A newer technique, spin-transfer torque (STT) or &quot;spin-transfer switching&quot;, uses spin-aligned (&quot;polarized&quot;) electrons to directly torque the domains. Specifically, if the electrons flowing into a layer have to change their spin, this will develop a torque that will be transferred to the nearby layer. This lowers the amount of current needed to write the cells, making it about the same as the read process. There are concerns that the &quot;classic&quot; type of MRAM cell will have difficulty at high densities because of the amount of current needed during writes, a problem that STT avoids. For this reason, the STT proponents expect the technique to be used for devices of 65 nm and smaller. The downside is the need to maintain the spin coherence. Overall, the STT requires much less write current than conventional or toggle MRAM. Research in this field indicates that STT current can be reduced up to 50 times by using a new composite structure. However, higher-speed operation still requires higher current.

Other potential arrangements include &quot;vertical transport MRAM&quot; (VMRAM), which uses current through a vertical column to change magnetic orientation, a geometric arrangement that reduces the write disturb problem and so can be used at higher density.

A review article provides the details of materials and challenges associated with MRAM in the perpendicular geometry. The authors describe a new term called &quot;Pentalemma&quot;, which represents a conflict in five different requirements such as write current, stability of the bits, readability, read/write speed and the process integration with CMOS. The selection of materials and the design of MRAM to fulfill those requirements are discussed.

== Comparison with other systems ==
===Density===
The main determinant of a memory system&#x27;s cost is the density of the components used to make it up. Smaller components, and fewer of them, mean that more &quot;cells&quot; can be packed onto a single chip, which in turn means more can be produced at once from a single silicon wafer. This improves yield, which is directly related to cost.

DRAM uses a small capacitor as a memory element, wires to carry current to and from it, and a transistor to control it – referred to as a &quot;1T1C&quot; cell. This makes DRAM the highest-density RAM currently available, and thus the least expensive, which is why it is used for the majority of RAM found in computers.

MRAM is physically similar to DRAM in makeup, and often does require a transistor for the write operation (though not strictly necessary). The scaling of transistors to higher density necessarily leads to lower available current, which could limit MRAM performance at advanced nodes.

===Power consumption===
Since the capacitors used in DRAM lose their charge over time, memory assemblies that use DRAM must &quot;refresh&quot; all the cells in their chips several times a second, reading each one and re-writing its contents. As DRAM cells decrease in size it is necessary to refresh the cells more often, resulting in greater power consumption.

In contrast, MRAM never requires a refresh. This means that not only does it retain its memory with the power turned off but also there is no constant power-draw. While the read process in theory requires more power than the same process in a DRAM, in practice the difference appears to be very close to zero. However, the write process requires more power to overcome the existing field stored in the junction, varying from three to eight times the power required during reading. Although the exact amount of power savings depends on the nature of the work — more frequent writing will require more power – in general MRAM proponents expect much lower power consumption (up to 99% less) compared to DRAM. STT-based MRAMs eliminate the difference between reading and writing, further reducing power requirements.

It is also worth comparing MRAM with another common memory system — flash RAM. Like MRAM, flash does not lose its memory when power is removed, which makes it very common in applications requiring persistent storage. When used for reading, flash and MRAM are very similar in power requirements. However, flash is re-written using a large pulse of voltage (about 10 V) that is stored up over time in a charge pump, which is both power-hungry and time-consuming. In addition, the current pulse physically degrades the flash cells, which means flash can only be written to some finite number of times before it must be replaced.

In contrast, MRAM requires only slightly more power to write than read, and no change in the voltage, eliminating the need for a charge pump. This leads to much faster operation, lower power consumption, and an indefinitely long lifetime.

===Data retention===
MRAM is often touted as being a non-volatile memory. However, the current mainstream high-capacity MRAM, spin-transfer torque memory, provides improved retention at the cost of higher power consumption, &quot;i.e.&quot;, higher write current. In particular, the critical (minimum) write current is directly proportional to the thermal stability factor Δ. The retention is in turn proportional to exp(Δ). The retention, therefore, degrades exponentially with reduced write current.

===Speed===
Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) performance is limited by the rate at which the charge stored in the cells can be drained (for reading) or stored (for writing). MRAM operation is based on measuring voltages rather than charges or currents, so there is less &quot;settling time&quot; needed. IBM researchers have demonstrated MRAM devices with access times on the order of 2 ns, somewhat better than even the most advanced DRAMs built on much newer processes. A team at the German Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt have demonstrated MRAM devices with 1 ns settling times, better than the currently accepted theoretical limits for DRAM, although the demonstration was a single cell. The differences compared to flash are far more significant, with write speeds as much as thousands of times faster. However, these speed comparisons are not for like-for-like current. High-density memory requires small transistors with reduced current, especially when built for low standby leakage. Under such conditions, write times shorter than 30 ns may not be reached so easily. In particular, to meet solder reflow stability of 260 °C over 90 seconds, 250 ns pulses have been required. This is related to the elevated thermal stability requirement driving up the write bit error rate. In order to avoid breakdown from higher current, longer pulses are needed.

For the perpendicular STT MRAM, the switching time is largely determined by the thermal stability Δ as well as the write current. A larger Δ (better for data retention) would require a larger write current or a longer pulse. A combination of high speed and adequate retention is only possible with a sufficiently high write current.

The only current memory technology that easily competes with MRAM in terms of performance at comparable density is static random-access memory (SRAM). SRAM consists of a series of transistors arranged in a flip-flop, which will hold one of two states as long as power is applied. Since the transistors have a very low power requirement, their switching time is very low. However, since an SRAM cell consists of several transistors, typically four or six, its density is much lower than DRAM. This makes it expensive, which is why it is used only for small amounts of high-performance memory, notably the CPU cache in almost all modern central processing unit designs.

Although MRAM is not quite as fast as SRAM, it is close enough to be interesting even in this role. Given its much higher density, a CPU designer may be inclined to use MRAM to offer a much larger but somewhat slower cache, rather than a smaller but faster one. It remains to be seen how this trade-off will play out in the future.

===Endurance===
The endurance of MRAM is affected by write current, just like retention and speed, as well as read current. When the write current is sufficiently large for speed and retention, the probability of MTJ breakdown needs to be considered. If the read current/write current ratio is not small enough, read disturb becomes more likely, i.e., a read error occurs during one of the many switching cycles. The read disturb error rate is given by
:formula_1,

where τ is the relaxation time (1 ns) and Icrit is the critical write current. Higher endurance requires a sufficiently low formula_2. However, a lower Iread also reduces read speed.

Endurance is mainly limited by the possible breakdown of the thin MgO layer.

===Overall===
MRAM has similar performance to SRAM, enabled by the use of sufficient write current. However, this dependence on write current also makes it a challenge to compete with the higher density comparable to mainstream DRAM and Flash. Nevertheless, some opportunities for MRAM exist where density need not be maximized. From a fundamental physics point of view, the spin-transfer torque approach to MRAM is bound to a &quot;rectangle of death&quot; formed by retention, endurance, speed, and power requirements, as covered above.

While the power-speed tradeoff is universal for electronic devices, the endurance-retention tradeoff at high current and the degradation of both at low Δ is problematic. Endurance is largely limited to 108 cycles.

===Alternatives to MRAM===
Flash and EEPROM&#x27;s limited write-cycles are a serious problem for any real RAM-like role. In addition, the high power needed to write the cells is a problem in low-power nodes, where non-volatile RAM is often used. The power also needs time to be &quot;built up&quot; in a device known as a charge pump, which makes writing dramatically slower than reading, often as low as 1/1000 as fast. While MRAM was certainly designed to address some of these issues, a number of other new memory devices are in production or have been proposed to address these shortcomings.

To date, the only similar system to enter widespread production is ferroelectric RAM, or F-RAM (sometimes referred to as FeRAM).

Also seeing renewed interest are silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) memory and ReRAM. 3D XPoint has also been in development, but is known to have a higher power budget than DRAM.

<doc id="315015" wikidata="Q1951431" url="?curid=315015" title="Maghull">
<text>Maghull ( ) is a town and civil parish in Sefton, Merseyside, England. The town is north of Liverpool and west of Kirkby. The town is also the location of Ashworth Hospital.

Maghull had a population of 20,444 at the 2011 Census. Housing in the town is almost entirely a 20th-century settlement of semi-detached and detached housing although remains of the original town do exist. The town has had an elected council since the Local Government Act 1894 when the government set up a network of local governance across England. Following the Local Government Act 1974, the council changed its name from a parish to a town council.

==Etymology==
It has been proposed by Dr Eilert Ekwall that the name Maghull may have been derived from the Celtic word &quot;magos&quot; referring to a plain or field, and the Old English &quot;halh&quot; referring to a corner or nook, giving the meaning of a &quot;flat land in a bend&quot;. Another theorised origin is Anglo-Saxon &quot;mægðe&quot; to refer to mayweed.

== History ==

The original settlement, consisting of fifty people and six square miles of agricultural settlement, was established prior to the Domesday Survey of 1086 where the town is recorded as Magele on a ridge of high ground, that can be most clearly seen at Red Lion Bridge towards the centre of the town and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal follows it on the plain and the A5147 on the brow. This ridge marks the edge of the flood plain of the River Alt, providing protection from flooding and access to this fertile pasture of the plain. A church is known to have existed in the area in 1100 although it has been rebuilt at least once and the chapel still stands, in the churchyard of the Victorian St Andrew&#x27;s and is the oldest ecclesiastical building in Merseyside still in regular use for worship but in 1756 the mediaeval nave of Maghull Chapel was pulled down with a Roman Catholic dual-purpose school-chapel opening in 1890 near Massey&#x27;s Barn.

It is noted that in 1568 Maghull Moss was divided between Sir Richard Molyneux of Melling and Edward Hulme of Maghull. The boundary of Maghull was, in the north, Maghull Brook and to the south, Melling Brook; the west was marked by the River Alt. At the eastern edge, however, the boundary was ill-defined on the moorland and due to the value of turf from the moss as a vital fuel this caused regular disputes between both Maghull and Melling Manors. Maghull Manor House was built in 1638 and local tradition has it that Charles II slept there during a visit to the area but by 1780 a new manor house had been built near the site of the original and it still stands in the grounds of Maghull Homes with part of the original moat.

It is also recorded that by 1667 the population of Maghull had increased to 599 with 136 houses and 127 families and by 1770 initial work had begun on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal with the first sod being cut by the Honourable Charles Lewis Mordaunt. The actual spot lies in a rock cutting 400 metres to the east of Halsall Hill Bridge. Soon after, the Red Lion public house was built in Maghull to serve the canal trade. It became a café and general store in the 20th century and was demolished after the Second World War. Several other canalside pubs were built over the years; for example, near Hall Lane Bridge there was the Traveller&#x27;s Rest (demolished 1936) and the Horse and Jockey in Melling. In 1774, the canal had reached Maghull and provided it with its second connection to Liverpool. The arrival of the canal created new industry in the area, notably quarrying of sandstone and clay extraction. It also bolstered the local hostelry trade.

Maghull&#x27;s first school was founded in 1668 in a small cottage in School Lane with the headmaster being Humphries Webster, showing the town&#x27;s emergence although County Rates from 1716 said of the town &quot;Maghull doth always bear and pay a third less than either Down Holland or Lidyeat&quot;. This shows that Maghull was a developing community, but still not as rich as its neighbours Downholland and Lydiate. Economic development continued with the Molyneux family (Earls of Sefton) being significantly active in bringing about the Alt Drainage Act in 1779 which resulted in many acres of marshland along the river eventually becoming good agricultural land. This had led to the growth of the population to 534, with about half the employment being in trade rather than agriculture and a rise in 1815 to a population of 720 people with 71 families engaged in agriculture and 29 in trade, manufactures and handicrafts. There were 108 inhabited houses.

By the 1820s, horse racing was well established on land in Maghull. Old Racecourse Farm later became the site for the Meadows Hotel; and Old Racecourse Road, off Sefton Lane, commemorates the sport. Baines&#x27; Directory of Lancashire in 1825 provided the first list of specialist male occupations in Maghull – 1 blacksmith, 1 cooper, 1 tailor, 1 land surveyor and 1 wheelwright.

By 1840 the agriculture of the area had changed from animal to arable farming and the 1861 National Census the population stood at 1,222. Due to this increase in population the railway came to Maghull in 1849, with a station on the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway as well as the construction of the town&#x27;s first police station which was set up by Lancashire County Council in 1870 and the town got a second station in 1884, Sefton and Maghull, on the newly built Cheshire Lines Committee Southport &amp; Cheshire Lines Extension Railway to Southport, the line was an extension of the North Liverpool Extension Line. A large section of embankment has been destroyed to make space for Switch Island. In 1933 Northway (A59 road) was built, initially as a tree-lined single carriageway but dualled in the early 1960s, which bisects Maghull, taking travellers from Liverpool to Ormskirk off &#x27;Liverpool Road&#x27;. The arrival of Northway triggered an increased rate of expansion in Maghull.

In 1939, the IRA blew up the swing bridge at Green Lane on the canal but the strategic significance of this has never been fully explained due to Maghull&#x27;s relative insignificance. In the Second World War, three bombs landed, one adjacent to King George V Playing Fields, on the site of the former residential home, and one in Ormonde Drive and one in the middle of The Meadows Hotel bowling green A house that was then 16 Park Lane (now 321, the houses were renumbered in the late 1960s or early 1970s), Moss Side, was also destroyed; it was rebuilt in the 1950s. It served as a refuge for up to 6,000 people a night from Bootle. American and Polish army units were stationed in Maghull and it also held several camps for displaced persons. Park Lane TB sanatorium and a hospital, built to treat shell shock victims, were combined to form Ashworth Hospital and one hundred patients transferred from Rampton Secure Hospital with it remaining a secure hospital to this day, holding such patients as Ian Brady. In 2010, plans were announced by the Labour government that new housing was needed and Sefton East – where Maghull is – was chosen as one of the locations for the new homes. Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council showcased the plans at various locations around south Sefton, and were met by local opposition.

==Geography==

Maghull is seven miles north-northeast of Liverpool city centre. To the northwest is Lydiate, to the east Melling, to the south Aintree and Netherton and to the west the Mersey Forest and Sefton village. Maghull is separated from the rest of the Greater Liverpool sprawl by a green belt which runs across the Switch Island motorway junction and through which flows the River Alt.

==Governance==

In 1912, the Maghull &amp; District Conservative Club was founded on Station Road; it still stands today. The Maghull Labour Party was formed in 1928. Maghull has been governed as part of the Borough of Sefton since the Local Government Act 1974, when the boundaries were redrawn. Maghull moved from Lancashire into Merseyside. Maghull has had an elected council since the Local Government Act 1894 when the government set up a network of local councils across England. Following the Local Government Act 1974, the council changed its name from a parish to a town council and remains the second largest town council in England. Maghull has worked with the neighbouring parishes and villages, as well as Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council under the banner of the Altside Business Village, to give businesses in the areas a united voice and to promote tourism in the area. For this scheme, Maghull works with Aintree, Lydiate, Melling and Sefton Village; all of which are connected geographically as being near the River Alt – hence the name Altside, and politically as they are all in the eastern parishes of Sefton borough. By 1971 the population of the town stood at 22,794 and gave Maghull the largest population of any civil parish in the country.

Maghull also has a town council, established by the 1974 Local Government Act. The town council is composed of councillors elected every four years. The council has been under the control of Labour since the 2011 local elections. Since 2019 it has the following make up 12 Labour, 2 Conservatives and 2 Independent Councillors. Maghull town council is made up of four wards: East which elects five councillors, West which elects four councillors, North which elects five councillors, and South which elects two Councillors

Maghull also falls into Molyneux, Park and Sudell Wards on Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council. There are 3 Borough Councillors to each of these wards.

==Education==

Education in the town began with William Harper founding the Maghull School in Damfield Lane, the location of Maricourt Catholic High School, in 1815 under the terms of his will. In 1839, the National School, later St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England School, was built and the earlier school, a small cottage, which still stands, became the headmaster&#x27;s house. Money for the school, which cost £450 7s 0d (£450.35p), was raised by local subscription and the schoolmistress was paid £5 a year, and each scholar had to pay one penny (1d) a month towards the cost of a fire, and tuppence (2d) a month for pens and ink, if they were being taught to write but by 1873 a second storey was added to the school to accommodate the growing population. In 1957, the Sisters of Mercy created the Maricourt Catholic High School with all students initially taught in Quarry Brook House with an initial intake of only twelve girls. In 1982, Old Hall High School, formerly Maghull Grammar School, was merged with Ormonde Drive High School to form Maghull High School, concentrating on the Ormonde Drive site. Today Maghull contains several primary schools including State, Roman Catholic and Church of England schools. There are also three high schools which all contain independent Sixth Form facilities, working together as part of the Maghull Collaborative. These secondary schools being Deyes High School, Maghull High School and Maricourt Catholic High School. As well as serving Maghull, the secondary schools serve pupils from the neighbouring towns in south Sefton, and the neighbouring local authorities of the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley and Liverpool.

==Transport==

Maghull is bisected by the A59 road and is served by Maghull railway station and the Maghull North railway station, along with bus routes to the nearby areas of Kirkby, Southport, Ormskirk and Liverpool city centre with most running past or near Maghull Square. The M57 and M58 motorways start at Switch Island, between Aintree and Maghull. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the centre of old Maghull. The Trans Pennine Trail, a long-distance footpath from Southport to Hornsea, near Hull skirts Maghull, following the line of the old Cheshire Lines railway.

==Shopping==
Maghull saw some regeneration during the early 1990s with the creation of a central square shopping region. Over the road from the new shopping square was &quot;Clent House&quot;, then owned by farmer John Cropper who sold the land and property around 1993 to the local authorities. Cropper&#x27;s family had owned the land for generations, while their house was fronted by a &quot;picturesque delf, ringed by trees&quot; and was considered among the more beautiful parts of Maghull. Plans to regenerate the site were set in motion to provide needed amenities for the area, with a new police station and council offices among the suggestions.

Maghull is presently served by the Central Square Shopping Centre, which is based in the northwest of Maghull, which is the original town centre. Known locally as &quot;the square&quot;, it contains several shops, a police station, numerous banks and nearby is a Morrisons supermarket. In Kennessee Green there is a shopping area called Tree View Court. There are also the Meadows shops near to Maghull Town Hall and Deyes Lane shops near the end of Deyes Lane, about five or ten minutes walking distance from Deyes High School.

== Community ==
In 1929, the Maghull Townswomen&#x27;s Guild was formed. It later became the Maghull Summerhill Townswomen&#x27;s Guild and was a Registered Charity, but closed in 2014. The Maghull Community Association on Green Lane provides live entertainment, family fun days and special events such as Christmas parties and ladies nights. In 2009, Maghull Town Hall was given a large extension costing £8.2million, and which included a library and sports facilities.

==Media==
The main local newspapers are the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; (evening) and the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; (morning). Both are tabloids published by the Trinity Mirror group. There are also two local newspapers, the &quot;Aintree &amp; Maghull Champion&quot; and the &quot;Maghull Star&quot;, both of which are free and are delivered every week either on a Wednesday or a Thursday.

The 3rd and 4th teams play at the Parkhaven Trust, which is situated a few hundred metres from the main Old Hall pitch.

Maghull F.C. joined the Lancashire Combination in 1972.

<text>VM (often: VM/CMS) is a family of IBM virtual machine operating systems used on IBM mainframes System/370, System/390, zSeries, System z and compatible systems, including the Hercules emulator for personal computers.

== Design ==

The heart of the VM architecture is the &quot;Control Program&quot; or hypervisor abbreviated CP, VM-CP and sometimes, ambiguously, VM. It runs on the physical hardware, and creates the virtual machine environment. VM-CP provides full virtualization of the physical machine – including all I/O and other privileged operations. It performs the system&#x27;s resource-sharing, including device management, dispatching, virtual storage management, and other traditional operating system tasks. Each VM user is provided with a separate virtual machine having its own address space, virtual devices, etc., and which is capable of running any software that could be run on a stand-alone machine. A given VM mainframe typically runs hundreds or thousands of virtual machine instances. VM-CP began life as CP-370, a reimplementation of CP-67, itself a reimplementation of CP-40.

Running within each virtual machine is another operating system, a &quot;guest operating system&quot;. This might be:

* CMS (Conversational Monitor System, renamed from the Cambridge Monitor System of CP/CMS). Most virtual machines run CMS, a lightweight, single-user operating system. Its interactive environment is comparable to that of a single-user PC, including a file system, programming services, device access, and command-line processing. (While an earlier version of CMS was uncharitably described as &quot;CP/M on a mainframe&quot;, the comparison is an anachronism; the author of CP/M, Gary Kildall, was an experienced CMS user.)
* GCS (Group Control System), which provides a limited simulation of the MVS API. IBM originally provided GCS in order to run VTAM without a service OS/VS1 virtual machine and VTAM Communications Network Application (VCNA). RSCS V2 also ran under GCS.
* A mainstream operating system. IBM&#x27;s mainstream operating systems (e.g., the MVS and DOS/VSE families, OS/VS1, TSS/370, or another layer of VM/370 itself (see below)) can be loaded and run without modification. The VM hypervisor treats guest operating systems as application programs with exceptional privileges – it prevents them from directly using privileged instructions (those which would let applications take over the whole system or significant parts of it), but simulates privileged instructions on their behalf. Most mainframe operating systems terminate a normal application which tries to usurp the operating system&#x27;s privileges. The VM hypervisor can simulate several types of console terminals for the guest operating system, such as the hardcopy line-mode 3215, the graphical 3270 family, and the integrated console on newer System/390 and System Z machines. Other users can then access running virtual machines using the DIAL command at the logon screen, which will connect their terminal to the first available emulated 3270 device, or the first available 2703 device if the user is DIALing from a typewriter terminal.
* Another copy of VM. A &quot;second level&quot; instance of VM can be fully virtualized inside a virtual machine. This is how VM development and testing is done (a second-level VM can potentially implement a &quot;different&quot; virtualization of the hardware). This technique was used to develop S/370 software before S/370 hardware was available, and it has continued to play a role in new hardware development at IBM. The literature cites practical examples of virtualization &quot;five levels deep&quot;. Levels of VM below the top are also treated as applications but with exceptional privileges.
* A copy of the mainframe version of AIX or Linux. In the mainframe environment, these operating systems often run under VM, and are handled like other guest operating systems. (They can also run as &#x27;native&#x27; operating systems on the bare hardware.) There was also the short-lived IX/370, as well as S/370 and S/390 versions of AIX (AIX/370 and AIX/ESA).
* A specialized VM subsystem. Several non-CMS systems run within VM-CP virtual machines, providing services to CMS users such as spooling, interprocess communications, specialized device support, and networking. They operate behind the scenes, extending the services available to CMS without adding to the VM-CP control program. By running in separate virtual machines, they receive the same security and reliability protections as other VM users. Examples include:
** RSCS (Remote Spooling and Communication Subsystem, aka VNET) – communication and information transfer facilities between virtual machines and other systems
** RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) — a security system
** Shared File System (SFS), which organizes shared files in a directory tree (the servers are commonly named &quot;VMSERVx&quot;)
** VTAM (Virtual Telecommunications Access Method) – a facility that provides support for a Systems Network Architecture network
** PVM (VM/Pass-Through Facility) – a facility that provides remote access to other VM systems
** TCPIP, SMTP, FTPSERVE, PORTMAP, VMNFS – a set of service machines that provide TCP/IP networking to VM/CMS
** Db2 Server for VM – a SQL database system, the servers are often named similarly to &quot;SQLMACH&quot; and &quot;SQLMSTR&quot;
** DIRMAINT – A simplified user directory management system (the directory is a listing of every account on the system, including virtual hardware configuration, user passwords, and minidisks).
** MUMPS/VM — an implementation of the MUMPS database and programming language which could run as guest on VM/370. MUMPS/VM was introduced in 1987 and discontinued in 1991.
* A user-written or modified operating system, such as National CSS&#x27;s CSS or Boston University&#x27;s VPS/VM.

== Versions ==

The following versions are known:

; Virtual Machine Facility/370:VM/370, released in 1972, is a System/370 reimplementation of earlier CP/CMS operating system.
; VM/370 Basic System Extensions Program Product:VM/BSE (BSEPP) is an enhancement to VM/370 that adds support for more devices (such as 3370-type fixed-block-architecture DASD drives), improvements to the CMS environment (such as an improved editor), and some stability enhancements to CP.
; VM/370 System Extensions Program Product:VM/SE (SEPP) is an enhancement to VM/370 that includes the facilities of VM/BSE, as well as a few additional fixes and features.
; Virtual Machine/System Product:VM/SP, a milestone version, replaces VM/370, VM/BSE and VM/SE. Release 1 added EXEC2 and XEDIT System Product Editor; Release 3 added REXX; Release 6 added the shared filesystem.
; Virtual Machine/System Product High Performance Option:VM/SP HPO adds additional device support and functionality to VM/SP, and allows certain S/370 machines that can utilize more than 16 MB of real storage to do so, up to 64 MB. This version was intended for users that would be running multiple S/370 guests at once.
; Virtual Machine/Extended Architecture Migration Aid: VM/XA MA is intended to ease the migration from MVS/370 to MVS/XA by allowing both to run concurrently on the same processor complex.
; Virtual Machine/Extended Architecture System Facility: VM/XA SF is an upgraded VM/XA MA with improved functionality and performance.
; Virtual Machine/Extended Architecture System Product: VM/XA SP is an upgraded VM/XA MA with improved functionality and performance, offered as a replacement for VM/SP HPO on machines supporting S/370-XA. It includes a version of CMS that can run in either S/370 or S/370-XA mode.
; Virtual Machine/Enterprise Systems Architecture:VM/ESA provides the facilities of VM/SP, VM/SP HPO and VM/XA SP. VM/ESA version 1 can run in S/370, ESA/370 or ESA/390 mode; it does not support S/370 XA mode. Version 2 only runs in ESA/390 mode. The S/370-capable versions of VM/ESA were actually their own separate version from the ESA/390 versions of VM/ESA, as the S/370 versions are based on the older VM/SP HPO codebase, and the ESA/390 versions are based on the newer VM/XA codebase.
; z/VM:z/VM, the last version still widely used as one of the main full virtualization solutions for the mainframe market. z/VM 4.4 was the last version that could run in ESA/390 mode; subsequent versions only run in z/Architecture mode.

The CMS in the name refers to the Conversational Monitor System, a component of the product that is a single-user operating system that runs in a virtual machine and provides conversational time-sharing in VM.

== Hypervisor interface ==

IBM coined the term &quot;hypervisor&quot; for the 360/65 and later used it for the DIAG handler of CP-67.

The &quot;Diagnose&quot; instruction (&#x27;83&#x27;x—no mnemonic) is a &quot;privileged instruction&quot; originally intended by IBM to perform &quot;built-in diagnostic functions, or other model-dependent functions.&quot; IBM repurposed DIAG for &quot;communication between a virtual machine and CP.&quot; The instruction contains two four-bit register numbers, called Rx and Ry, which can &quot;contain operand storage addresses or return codes passed to the DIAGNOSE interface,&quot; and a two-byte code &quot;that CP uses to determine what DIAGNOSE function to perform.&quot; The available diagnose functions include:

At one time, CMS was capable of running on a bare machine, as a true operating system (though such a configuration would be unusual). It now runs only as a guest OS under VM. This is because CMS relies on a hypervisor interface to VM-CP, to perform file system operations and request other VM services. This paravirtualization interface:

* Provides a fast path to VM-CP, to avoid the overhead of full simulation.
* Was first developed as a performance improvement for CP/CMS release 2.1, an important early milestone in CP&#x27;s efficiency.
* Uses a non-virtualized, model-dependent machine instruction as a signal between CMS and CP: DIAG (diagnose).

== Minidisks ==

CMS and other operating systems often have DASD requirements much smaller than the sizes of actual volumes. For this reason CP allows an installation to define virtual disks of any size up to the capacity of the device. For CKD volumes, a minidisk must be defined in full cylinders. A minidisk has the same attributes as the underlying real disk, except that it is usually smaller and the beginning of each minidisk is mapped to cylinder or block 0. The minidisk may be accessed using the same channel programs as the real disk.

A minidisk that has been initialized with a CMS file system is referred to as a CMS minidisk, although CMS is not the only system that can use them.

It is common practice to define full volume minidisks for use by such guest operating systems as z/OS instead of using codice_1 to assign the volume to a specific virtual machine. In addition, &quot;full-pack links&quot; are often defined for every DASD on the system, and are owned by the MAINT userid. These are used for backing up the system using the DASD Dump/Restore program, where the entire contents of a DASD are written to tape (or another DASD) exactly.

== Shared File System ==

With modern VM versions, most of the system can be installed to SFS, with the few remaining minidisks being the ones absolutely necessary for the system to start up, and the ones being owned by the filepool server machines.
VM/SP Release 6 introduced the Shared File System which vastly improved CMS file storage capabilities. The CMS minidisk file system does not support directories (folders) at all, however, the SFS does. SFS also introduces more granular security. With CMS minidisks, the system can be configured to allow or deny users read-only or read-write access to a disk, but single files cannot have the same security. SFS alleviates this, and vastly improves performance.

The SFS is provided by service virtual machines. On a modern VM system, there are usually three that are required: VMSERVR, the &quot;recovery machine&quot; that does not actually serve any files; VMSERVS, the server for the VMSYS filepool; and VMSERVU, the server for the VMSYSU (user) filepool. The file pool server machines own several minidisks, usually including a CMS A-disk (virtual device address 191, containing the file pool configuration files), a control disk, a log disk, and any number of data disks that actually store user files.

If a user account is configured to only use SFS (and does not own any minidisks), the user&#x27;s A-disk will be codice_2 and any subsequent directories that the user creates will be codice_3 where the equivalent UNIX file path is codice_4. SFS directories can have much more granular access controls when compared to minidisks (which, as mentioned above, can often only have a read password, a write password, and a multi-write password). SFS directories also solve the issues that may arise when two users write to the same CMS minidisk at the same time, which may cause disk corruption (as the CMS VM performing the writes may be unaware that another CMS instance is also writing to the minidisk). 

The file pool server machines also serve a closely related filesystem: the Byte File System. BFS is used to store files on a UNIX-style filesystem. Its primary use is for the VM OpenExtensions POSIX environment for CMS. The CMS user virtual machines themselves communicate with the SFS server virtual machines through the IUCV mechanism.

== History ==

The early history of VM is described in the articles CP/CMS and History of CP/CMS. VM/370 is a reimplementation of CP/CMS, and was made available in 1972 as part of IBM&#x27;s System/370 Advanced Function announcement (which added virtual memory hardware and operating systems to the System/370 series). Early releases of VM through VM/370 Release 6 continued in open source through 1981, and today are considered to be in the public domain. This policy ended in 1977 with the chargeable VM/SE and VM/BSE upgrades and in 1980 with VM/System Product (VM/SP). However, IBM continued providing updates in source form for existing code for many years, although the upgrades to all but the free base required a license. As with CP-67, privileged instructions in a virtual machine cause a program interrupt, and CP simulated the behavior of the privileged instruction.
VM remained an important platform &quot;within&quot; IBM, used for operating system development and time-sharing use; but for customers it remained IBM&#x27;s &quot;other operating system&quot;. The OS and DOS families remained IBM&#x27;s strategic products, and customers were not encouraged to run VM. Those that did formed close working relationships, continuing the community-support model of early CP/CMS users. In the meantime, the system struggled with political infighting within IBM over what resources should be available to the project, as compared with other IBM efforts. A basic problem with the system was seen at IBM&#x27;s field sales level: VM/CMS demonstrably reduced the amount of hardware needed to support a given number of time-sharing users. IBM was, after all, in the business of selling computer systems.

Melinda Varian provides this fascinating quote, illustrating VM&#x27;s unexpected success:
The marketing forecasts for VM/370 predicted that no more than one 168 would ever run VM during the entire life of the product. In fact, the first 168 delivered to a customer ran only CP and CMS. Ten years later, ten percent of the large processors being shipped from Poughkeepsie would be destined to run VM, as would a very substantial portion of the mid-range machines that were built in Endicott. Before fifteen years had passed, there would be more VM licenses than MVS licenses.
A PC DOS version that runs CMS on the XT/370 (and later on the AT/370) is called VM/PC. VM/PC 1.1 was based on VM/SP release 3. When IBM introduced the P/370 and P/390 processor cards, a PC could now run full VM systems, including VM/370, VM/SP, VM/XA, and VM/ESA (these cards were fully compatible with S/370 and S/390 mainframes, and could run any S/370 operating system from the 31-bit era, e.g., MVS/ESA, VSE/ESA).

In addition to the base VM/SP releases, IBM also introduced VM/SP HPO (High Performance Option). This add-on (which is installed over the base VM/SP release) improved several key system facilities, including allowing the usage of more than 16 MB of storage (RAM) on supported models (such as the IBM 4381). With VM/SP HPO installed, the new limit was 64 MB; however, a single user (or virtual machine) could not use more than 16 MB. The functions of the spool filesystem were also improved, allowing 9900 spool files to be created per user, rather than 9900 for the whole system. The architecture of the spool filesystem was also enhanced, each spool file now had a unique user ID associated with it, and reader file control blocks were now held in virtual storage. The system could also be configured to deny certain users access to the vector facility (by means of user directory entries).

Releases of VM since VM/SP Release 1 supported multiprocessor systems. System/370 versions of VM (such as VM/SP and VM/SP HPO) supported a maximum of two processors, with the system operating in either UP (uniprocessor) mode, MP (multiprocessor) mode, or AP (attached processor) mode. AP mode is the same as MP mode, except the second processor lacks I/O capability. System/370-XA releases of VM (such as VM/XA) supported more. System/390 releases (such as VM/ESA) almost removed the limit entirely, and some modern z/VM systems can have as many as 80 processors. The per-VM limit for defined processors is 64.

When IBM introduced the System/370 Extended Architecture on the 3081, customers were faced with the need to run a production MVS/370 system while testing MVS/XA on the same machine. IBM&#x27;s solution was VM/XA Migration Aid, which used the new Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction to run the virtual machine. SIE automatically handled some privileged instructions and returned to CP for cases that it couldn&#x27;t handle. The Processor Resource/System Manager (PR/SM) of the later 3090 also used SIE. There were several VM/XA products before it was eventually supplanted by VM/ESA and z/VM.

In addition to RSCS networking, IBM also provided users with VTAM networking. ACF/VTAM for VM was fully compatible with ACF/VTAM on MVS and VSE. Like RSCS, VTAM on VM ran under the specialized GCS operating system. However, VM also supported TCP/IP networking. In the late 1980s, IBM produced a TCP/IP stack for VM/SP and VM/XA. The stack supported IPv4 networks, and a variety of network interface systems (such as inter-mainframe channel-to-channel links, or a specialized IBM RT PC that would relay traffic out to a Token Ring or Ethernet network). The stack provided support for Telnet connections, from either simple line-mode terminal emulators or VT100-compatible emulators, or proper IBM 3270 terminal emulators. The stack also provided an FTP server. IBM also produced an optional NFS server for VM; early versions were rather primitive, but modern versions are much more advanced.

There was also a fourth networking option, known as VM/Pass-Through Facility (or more commonly called, PVM). PVM, like VTAM, allowed for connections to remote VM/CMS systems, as well as other IBM systems. If two VM/CMS nodes were linked together over a channel-to-channel link or bisync link (possibly using a dialup modem or leased line), a user could remotely connect to either system by entering &quot;DIAL PVM&quot; on the VM login screen, then entering the system node name (or choosing it from a list of available nodes). Alternatively, a user running CMS could use the PASSTHRU program that was installed alongside PVM, allowing for quick access to remote systems without having to log out of the user&#x27;s session. PVM also supported accessing non-VM systems, by utilizing a 3x74 emulation technique. Later releases of PVM also featured a component that could accept connections from a SNA network.

VM was also the cornerstone operating system of BITNET, as the RSCS system available for VM provided a simple network that was easy to implement, and somewhat reliable. VM sites were interlinked by means of an RSCS VM on each VM system communicating with one another, and users could send and receive messages, files, and batch jobs through RSCS. The &quot;NOTE&quot; command used XEDIT to display a dialog to create an email, from which the user could send it. If the user specified an address in the form of codice_5, the email file would be delivered to RSCS, which would then deliver it to the target user on the target system. If the site has TCP/IP installed, RSCS could work with the SMTP service machine to deliver notes (emails) to remote systems, as well as receive them. If the user specified codice_6, the NOTE program would deliver the email to the SMTP service machine, which would then route it out to the destination site on the Internet.

VM&#x27;s role changed within IBM when hardware evolution led to significant changes in processor architecture. Backward compatibility remained a cornerstone of the IBM mainframe family, which still uses the basic instruction set introduced with the original System/360; but the need for efficient use of the 64-bit zSeries made the VM approach much more attractive. VM was also utilized in data centers converting from DOS/VSE to MVS and is useful when running mainframe AIX and Linux, platforms that were to become increasingly important. The current z/VM platform has finally achieved the recognition within IBM that VM users long felt it deserved. Some z/VM sites run thousands of simultaneous virtual machine users on a single system. z/VM was first released in October 2000 and remains in active use and development.

IBM and third parties have offered many applications and tools that run under VM. Examples include RAMIS, FOCUS, SPSS, NOMAD, DB2, REXX, RACF, and OfficeVision. Current VM offerings run the gamut of mainframe applications, including HTTP servers, database managers, analysis tools, engineering packages, and financial systems.

== CP commands ==

As of release 6, the VM/370 Control Program has a number of commands for General Users, concerned with defining and controlling the user&#x27;s virtual machine. Lower-case portions of the command are optional

== OpenEdition extensions ==

Starting with VM/ESA Version 2, IBM introduced the chargeable optional feature &quot;OpenEdition for VM/ESA Shell and Utilities Feature&quot;, which provides POSIX compatibility for CMS. The stand-out feature was a UNIX shell for CMS. The C compiler for this UNIX environment is provided by either C/370 or C for VM/ESA. Neither the CMS filesystem nor the standard VM Shared File System has any support for UNIX-style files and paths; instead, the Byte File System is used. Once a BFS extent is created in an SFS file pool, the user can mount it using the codice_7. The user must also mount the root filesystem, done with codice_8, a shell can then be started with codice_9. Unlike the normal SFS, access to BFS filesystems is controlled by POSIX permissions (with chmod and chown).

Starting with z/VM Version 3, IBM integrated OpenEdition into z/VM and renamed it OpenExtensions. OpenEdition and OpenExtensions provide POSIX.2 compliance to CMS. Programs compiled to run under the OpenExtensions shell are stored in the same format as standard CMS executable modules. Visual editors, such as vi are unavailable, as 3270 terminals are not capable. Users can use ed or XEDIT instead of vi.

== Marketing ==

In the early 1980s, the VM group within SHARE (the IBM user group) sought a mascot or logo for the community to adopt. This was in part a response to IBM&#x27;s MVS users selecting the turkey as a mascot (chosen, according to legend, by the MVS Performance Group in the early days of MVS, when its performance was a sore topic). In 1983, the teddy bear became VM&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; mascot at SHARE 60, when teddy bear stickers were attached to the nametags of &quot;cuddlier oldtimers&quot; to flag them for newcomers as &quot;friendly if approached&quot;. The bears were a hit and soon appeared widely. Bears were awarded to inductees of the &quot;Order of the Knights of VM&quot;, individuals who made &quot;useful contributions&quot; to the community.

<text>The Blitz Kids were a group of people who frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, London in 1979–1980, and are credited with launching the New Romantic subcultural movement.

== History ==
Steve Strange and Rusty Egan co-hosted these exclusive nights without giving them a name, according to Strange&#x27;s autobiography, and publicised them solely by word of mouth. An emphasis on style was ensured by enforcing a strict dress code at the door. Crucially, the Blitz lay between two art colleges (St Martin&#x27;s School and Central School) and it became a testbed for student fashion designers during the 1980s.

These included Stephen Jones, David Holah, Stevie Stewart, Darla Jane Gilroy, Michele Clapton, Kim Bowen, Fiona Dealey, Stephen Linard, among others. The Blitz began making headlines thanks to its patrons&#x27; styles of clothes and make-up for both sexes, subsequently documented by Gary Kemp in his 2009 first-person book, &quot;I Know This Much&quot;, and by Graham Smith and Chris Sullivan in their 2011 book &quot;We Can Be Heroes: London Clubland 1976-1984&quot;.

Other core attendees included Boy George, Marilyn, Alice Temple, Perri Lister, Princess Julia, Philip Sallon and Martin Degville (later to be the frontman of Tony James&#x27; Sigue Sigue Sputnik), Siobhan Fahey (later a member of Bananarama), Biddie and Eve (long-standing cabaret act at the Blitz as wine bar), Perry Haines (who became co-editor of the earliest issues of &quot;i-D&quot; magazine) and Chris Sullivan (who founded and ran the Wag club in Soho for 19 years).

The team of Strange as greeter and Egan as DJ came together at Billy&#x27;s nightclub in Soho in autumn 1978, when the post-punk generation found themselves bored with the whole nihilist punk genre, as Smith and Sullivan record. Strange and Egan introduced regular Roxy Music and David Bowie nights at Billy&#x27;s and, in an effort to find something new and colourful, the denizens took to wearing bizarre home-made costumes and clothing and emphatic make-up, presenting a highly androgynous appearance.

After three months, disagreements with the owner prompted them to move on from Billy&#x27;s – which had effectively formalised the once-a-week club-night. Helen Robinson, who ran the shop PX as the flagship for New Romantic ready-to-wear in Covent Garden, employed Strange as an assistant and it was she who encouraged him and Egan to transfer their energies in 1979 to the more elitist Blitz wine bar in Great Queen Street. Over the next 20 months their fashion-led Tuesday club-night was gradually acknowledged in the media as home to the New Romantic movement and prompted the &quot;Blitz Kids&quot; epithet in mainstream newspapers, led by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; on 3 March 1980.

In mid-1980, David Bowie visited the club and asked Strange and three other Blitz regulars to appear in the video for his single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, which helped to propel the New Romantic movement into the mainstream.

==Subcultural outcomes==
The Blitz club provided roots for several new pop groups, notably Visage with Steve Strange on vocals and Blitz DJ Rusty Egan on drums, then Spandau Ballet who played live gigs there in 1979 and 1980. Later, Blitz cloakroom attendant George O&#x27;Dowd became internationally famous in his own right as Boy George fronting Culture Club. Marilyn became a singer, but with limited chart success.

Boy George celebrated the Blitz Kids scene in his 2002 musical &quot;Taboo&quot;, in which he played the part of Leigh Bowery, who hosted the London weekly club-night called Taboo in 1985-87, long after the Blitz closed.

In January 2011, Steve Strange and Rusty Egan threw a one-off reunion party on the site of the original Blitz Club, with performances from Roman Kemp&#x27;s band Paradise Point and electro punk artist Quilla Constance, plus DJ sets from Egan himself. Egan simultaneously launched an official Blitz Club website incorporating a record label, which published three remixes in as many years.

In 2017 The National Portrait Gallery acquired portraits of Blitz Kids Stephen Linard, David Holah, John Maybury and Cerith Wyn Evans by photographer David Gwinnutt, which were displayed in the exhibition &quot;Before We Were Men&quot; 

In March 2021, Bruce Ashley&#x27;s documentary &quot;Blitzed: The 80&#x27;s Blitz Kids&#x27; Story&quot;, was shown on Sky Arts. Boy George, Rusty Egan and Marilyn all appeared in the film discussing their time at the club and about the early 1980s-era, whilst La Roux was interviewed about the cultural effects of the New Romantic movement on younger performers like herself.

The term &quot;multithreading&quot; is ambiguous, because not only can multiple threads be executed simultaneously on one CPU core, but also multiple tasks (with different page tables, different task state segments, different protection rings, different I/O permissions, etc.). Although running on the same core, they are completely separated from each other.
Multithreading is similar in concept to preemptive multitasking but is implemented at the thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors.

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is one of the two main implementations of multithreading, the other form being temporal multithreading (also known as super-threading). In temporal multithreading, only one thread of instructions can execute in any given pipeline stage at a time. In simultaneous multithreading, instructions from more than one thread can be executed in any given pipeline stage at a time. This is done without great changes to the basic processor architecture: the main additions needed are the ability to fetch instructions from multiple threads in a cycle, and a larger register file to hold data from multiple threads. The number of concurrent threads is decided by the chip designers. Two concurrent threads per CPU core are common, but some processors support many more.

Because it inevitably increases conflict on shared resources, measuring or agreeing on its effectiveness can be difficult. However, measured energy efficiency of SMT with parallel native and managed workloads on historical 130 nm to 32 nm Intel SMT (hyper-threading) implementations found that in 45 nm and 32 nm implementations, SMT is extremely energy efficient, even with in-order Atom processors. In modern systems, SMT effectively exploits concurrency with very little additional dynamic power. That is, even when performance gains are minimal the power consumption savings can be considerable.
Some researchers have shown that the extra threads can be used proactively to seed a shared resource like a cache, to improve the performance of another single thread, and claim this shows that SMT does not only increase efficiency. Others use SMT to provide redundant computation, for some level of error detection and recovery.

However, in most current cases, SMT is about hiding memory latency, increasing efficiency, and increasing throughput of computations per amount of hardware used.

==Taxonomy==
In processor design, there are two ways to increase on-chip parallelism with fewer resource requirements: one is superscalar technique which tries to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP); the other is multithreading approach exploiting thread-level parallelism (TLP).

Superscalar means executing multiple instructions at the same time while thread-level parallelism (TLP) executes instructions from multiple threads within one processor chip at the same time. There are many ways to support more than one thread within a chip, namely:
* Interleaved multithreading: Interleaved issue of multiple instructions from different threads, also referred to as temporal multithreading. It can be further divided into fine-grained multithreading or coarse-grained multithreading depending on the frequency of interleaved issues. Fine-grained multithreading—such as in a barrel processor—issues instructions for different threads after every cycle, while coarse-grained multithreading only switches to issue instructions from another thread when the current executing thread causes some long latency events (like page fault etc.). Coarse-grain multithreading is more common for less context switch between threads. For example, Intel&#x27;s Montecito processor uses coarse-grained multithreading, while Sun&#x27;s UltraSPARC T1 uses fine-grained multithreading. For those processors that have only one pipeline per core, interleaved multithreading is the only possible way, because it can issue at most one instruction per cycle.
* Simultaneous multithreading (SMT): Issue multiple instructions from multiple threads in one cycle. The processor must be superscalar to do so.
* Chip-level multiprocessing (CMP or multicore): integrates two or more processors into one chip, each executing threads independently.
* Any combination of multithreaded/SMT/CMP.

The key factor to distinguish them is to look at how many instructions the processor can issue in one cycle and how many threads from which the instructions come. For example, Sun Microsystems&#x27; UltraSPARC T1 is a multicore processor combined with fine-grain multithreading technique instead of simultaneous multithreading because each core can only issue one instruction at a time.

== Historical implementations ==
While multithreading CPUs have been around since the 1950s, simultaneous multithreading was first researched by IBM in 1968 as part of the ACS-360 project. The first major commercial microprocessor developed with SMT was the Alpha 21464 (EV8). This microprocessor was developed by DEC in coordination with Dean Tullsen of the University of California, San Diego, and Susan Eggers and Henry Levy of the University of Washington. The microprocessor was never released, since the Alpha line of microprocessors was discontinued shortly before HP acquired Compaq which had in turn acquired DEC. Dean Tullsen&#x27;s work was also used to develop the hyper-threaded versions of the Intel Pentium 4 microprocessors, such as the &quot;Northwood&quot; and &quot;Prescott&quot;.

== Modern commercial implementations ==
The Intel Pentium 4 was the first modern desktop processor to implement simultaneous multithreading, starting from the 3.06 GHz model released in 2002, and since introduced into a number of their processors. Intel calls the functionality Hyper-Threading Technology, and provides a basic two-thread SMT engine. Intel claims up to a 30% speed improvement compared against an otherwise identical, non-SMT Pentium 4. The performance improvement seen is very application-dependent; however, when running two programs that require full attention of the processor it can actually seem like one or both of the programs slows down slightly when Hyper-threading is turned on. This is due to the replay system of the Pentium 4 tying up valuable execution resources, increasing contention for resources such as bandwidth, caches, TLBs, re-order buffer entries, and equalizing the processor resources between the two programs which adds a varying amount of execution time. The Pentium 4 Prescott core gained a replay queue, which reduces execution time needed for the replay system. This was enough to completely overcome that performance hit.

The latest Imagination Technologies MIPS architecture designs include an SMT system known as &quot;MIPS MT&quot;. MIPS MT provides for both heavyweight virtual processing elements and lighter-weight hardware microthreads. RMI, a Cupertino-based startup, is the first MIPS vendor to provide a processor SOC based on eight cores, each of which runs four threads. The threads can be run in fine-grain mode where a different thread can be executed each cycle. The threads can also be assigned priorities. Imagination Technologies MIPS CPUs have two SMT threads per core.

IBM&#x27;s Blue Gene/Q has 4-way SMT.

The IBM POWER5, announced in May 2004, comes as either a dual core dual-chip module (DCM), or quad-core or oct-core multi-chip module (MCM), with each core including a two-thread SMT engine. IBM&#x27;s implementation is more sophisticated than the previous ones, because it can assign a different priority to the various threads, is more fine-grained, and the SMT engine can be turned on and off dynamically, to better execute those workloads where an SMT processor would not increase performance. This is IBM&#x27;s second implementation of generally available hardware multithreading. In 2010, IBM released systems based on the POWER7 processor with eight cores with each having four Simultaneous Intelligent Threads. This switches the threading mode between one thread, two threads or four threads depending on the number of process threads being scheduled at the time. This optimizes the use of the core for minimum response time or maximum throughput. IBM POWER8 has 8 intelligent simultaneous threads per core (SMT8).

IBM Z starting with the z13 processor in 2013 has two threads per core (SMT-2).

Although many people reported that Sun Microsystems&#x27; UltraSPARC T1 (known as &quot;Niagara&quot; until its 14 November 2005 release) and the now defunct processor codenamed &quot;Rock&quot; (originally announced in 2005, but after many delays cancelled in 2010) are implementations of SPARC focused almost entirely on exploiting SMT and CMP techniques, Niagara is not actually using SMT. Sun refers to these combined approaches as &quot;CMT&quot;, and the overall concept as &quot;Throughput Computing&quot;. The Niagara has eight cores, but each core has only one pipeline, so actually it uses fine-grained multithreading. Unlike SMT, where instructions from multiple threads share the issue window each cycle, the processor uses a round robin policy to issue instructions from the next active thread each cycle. This makes it more similar to a barrel processor. Sun Microsystems&#x27; Rock processor is different: it has more complex cores that have more than one pipeline.

The Oracle Corporation SPARC T3 has eight fine-grained threads per core; SPARC T4, SPARC T5, SPARC M5, M6 and M7 have eight fine-grained threads per core of which two can be executed simultaneously.

Fujitsu SPARC64 VI has coarse-grained Vertical Multithreading (VMT) SPARC VII and newer have 2-way SMT.

Intel Itanium Montecito uses coarse-grained multithreading and Tukwila and newer ones use 2-way SMT (with dual-domain multithreading).

Intel Xeon Phi has 4-way SMT (with time-multiplexed multithreading) with hardware-based threads which cannot be disabled, unlike regular Hyper-Threading. The Intel Atom, first released in 2008, is the first Intel product to feature 2-way SMT (marketed as Hyper-Threading) without supporting instruction reordering, speculative execution, or register renaming. Intel reintroduced Hyper-Threading with the Nehalem microarchitecture, after its absence on the Core microarchitecture.

AMD Bulldozer microarchitecture FlexFPU and Shared L2 cache are multithreaded but integer cores in module are single threaded, so it is only a partial SMT implementation.

AMD Zen microarchitecture has 2-way SMT.

VISC architecture uses the &quot;Virtual Software Layer&quot; (translation layer) to dispatch a single thread of instructions to the &quot;Global Front End&quot; which splits instructions into &quot;virtual hardware threadlets&quot; which are then dispatched to separate virtual cores. These virtual cores can then send them to the available resources on any of the physical cores. Multiple virtual cores can push threadlets into the reorder buffer of a single physical core, which can split partial instructions and data from multiple threadlets through the execution ports at the same time. Each virtual core keeps track of the position of the relative output. This form of multithreading can increase single threaded performance by allowing a single thread to use all resources of the CPU. The allocation of resources is dynamic on a near-single cycle latency level (1–4 cycles depending on the change in allocation depending on individual application needs. Therefore, if two virtual cores are competing for resources, there are appropriate algorithms in place to determine what resources are to be allocated where.

== Disadvantages ==
Depending on the design and architecture of the processor, simultaneous multithreading can decrease performance if any of the shared resources are bottlenecks for performance. Critics argue that it is a considerable burden to put on software developers that they have to test whether simultaneous multithreading is good or bad for their application in various situations and insert extra logic to turn it off if it decreases performance. Current operating systems lack convenient API calls for this purpose and for preventing processes with different priority from taking resources from each other.

There is also a security concern with certain simultaneous multithreading implementations. Intel&#x27;s hyperthreading in NetBurst-based processors has a vulnerability through which it is possible for one application to steal a cryptographic key from another application running in the same processor by monitoring its cache use. There are also sophisticated machine learning exploits to HT implementation that were explained at Black Hat 2018.

<doc id="315025" wikidata="Q4696833" url="?curid=315025" title="Aigburth">
<text>Aigburth () is a suburb of Liverpool, England. Located to the south of the city, it is bordered by Toxteth and Dingle to the north, Mossley Hill to the east, and Garston to the south, with the River Mersey forming its western boundary.

== Description ==
Historically a part of Lancashire, Aigburth is mainly residential and covers an area following Aigburth Road (A561) and the areas either side of it until it reaches Grassendale. The suburb is to the south of Sefton Park and adjoins Otterspool Park, which leads to Otterspool Promenade on the Mersey. Housing in the district is mostly a mixture of terraced and semi detached homes, with large detached houses (mostly converted into flats or hotels) in Aigburth Drive overlooking Sefton Park and modern estates containing detached and semi detached houses in the Riverside Drive area. Lark Lane (between Aigburth Road and Sefton Park) is a lively place with many independent shops, restaurants and bars. &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article about Aigburth in 2007 in its &#x27;Let&#x27;s move to ...&#x27; series.

== Etymology ==
The name Aigburth comes from Old Norse &quot;eik&quot; and &quot;berg&quot;, meaning &quot;oak-tree hill&quot;. The name can be interpreted as &quot;hill where oak trees grow&quot; and is a hybrid place-name: the first part of the name is from Old Norse &quot;eik&quot; meaning &quot;oak tree&quot; (which is found in Eikton in Cumbria and Eakring in Nottinghamshire) and Old English &quot;beorg&quot; or &quot;berg&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot; but as there is no real hill in Aigburth the sense here is more likely to be &quot;rising ground&quot;. Beorg or berg is more usually rendered &quot;-borough&quot; (as in Barlborough in Derbyshire) or more rarely as &quot;-barrow&quot; (as in Backbarrow in Cumbria). The name was also recorded as &quot;Eikberei&quot; in an undated record.

A possible other meaning of Aigburth is Aiges&#x27; Berth, meaning the place where the Viking Aiges berthed his long boat. This is plausible because Aigburth is right on the Merseyside river mouth and not on a hill. The nearby hill has a Viking name Toxteth, which means the camp of Toces.

The spelling &quot;Aigburgh&quot; (or, more rarely, &quot;Aighburgh&quot;) is sometimes found in old publications and historical documents (for example, S. Lewis, &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; (1848)), as well as in modern references to former residents
 and is occasionally seen as an alternative (if incorrect) spelling today.

== Governance ==
The area was previously part of the Mossley Hill parliamentary constituency and, as such, returned David Alton (now Lord Alton of Liverpool) for many years. It is now part of the Liverpool Riverside constituency and returned Louise Ellman as MP in the 2005 and 2010 general elections. The current MP is Kim Johnson.

The area is covered by the Liverpool City Council wards of Aigburth and Mossley Hill. The current councillors are Dave Antrobus and Rob McAllister-Bell.

== Education ==
The Aigburth Park halls of residence of Liverpool Hope University are located close to the railway line on St Michael&#x27;s Road. Up towards Mossley Hill are the former University of Liverpool Carnatic Halls of Residence built in between Elmswood and Carnatic Roads. These are closed, pending redevelopment. On the piece of land between Mossley Hill Road and Barkhill Road is the IM Marsh Campus of Liverpool John Moores University, where the Faculty of Education, Health and Community is based. Secondary schools in Aigburth include St Margaret&#x27;s Church of England Academy and Auckland College, a private school for ages 5–18. State primary schools in Aigburth are Sudley Infants and Sudley Juniors as well as St Michael-in-the-Hamlet Primary.

Prior to the reorganisation of secondary education in Liverpool in the 1980s, Aigburth was also home to Aigburth Vale Comprehensive School for Girls, formerly Aigburth Vale High School for Girls, which merged with Quarry Bank School to form Calderstones School.

== Transport ==
The area is served by Aigburth railway station on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network, located some distance from larger residential areas. St Michaels railway station is also situated in the area, at the bottom of Southwood Road.

== Sport ==
South Liverpool F.C., Liverpool Cricket Club, a regular home venue of Lancashire County Cricket Club, and Sefton Park Cricket Club, are located in Aigburth.

St Margaret&#x27;s Cricket and Community Sports Centre houses Respect 4 All, an official charity of Liverpool Football Club offering free football sports coaching for the disabled.

<doc id="315028" wikidata="Q412393" url="?curid=315028" title="Iodoform">
<text>Iodoform (also known as triiodomethane) is the organoiodine compound with the chemical formula . It is a pale yellow, crystalline, volatile substance, with a penetrating and distinctive odor (in older chemistry texts, the smell is sometimes referred to as that of hospitals, where the compound is still commonly used) and, analogous to chloroform, sweetish taste. It is occasionally used as a disinfectant.

==Naming==
The name iodoform originates with the &quot;formyle radical,&quot; an archaic term for the HC moiety, and is retained for historical consistency. A full, modern name is triiodomethane. Another possible name is &quot;carbon hydride triiodide&quot;. The &quot;hydride&quot; in the latter is sometimes omitted, though the IUPAC recommends against doing so, as &quot;carbon triiodide&quot; could also mean (hexaiodoethane, a highly unstable compound).

== Structure ==
The molecule adopts a tetrahedral geometry with C3v symmetry.

==Synthesis and reactions==
The synthesis of iodoform was first described by Georges-Simon Serullas in 1822, by reactions of iodine vapour with steam over red-hot coals, and also by reaction of potassium with ethanolic iodine in the presence of water; and at much the same time independently by John Thomas Cooper. It is synthesized in the haloform reaction by the reaction of iodine and sodium hydroxide with any one of these four kinds of organic compounds: a methyl ketone (), acetaldehyde (), ethanol (), and certain secondary alcohols (, where R is an alkyl or aryl group).

The reaction of iodine and base with methyl ketones is so reliable that the iodoform test (the appearance of a yellow precipitate) is used to probe the presence of a methyl ketone. This is also the case when testing for specific secondary alcohols containing at least one methyl group in alpha-position.

Some reagents (e.g. hydrogen iodide) convert iodoform to diiodomethane. Conversion to carbon dioxide is also possible. Iodoform reacts with aqueous silver nitrate to produce carbon monoxide. When treated with powdered elemental silver the iodoform is reduced, producing acetylene. Upon heating iodoform decomposes to produce diatomic iodine, hydrogen iodide gas, and carbon.

===Natural occurrence===
The angel&#x27;s bonnet mushroom contains iodoform, and shows its characteristic odor.

==Applications==
The compound finds small-scale use as a disinfectant. Around the beginning of the 20th century, it was used in medicine as a healing and antiseptic dressing for wounds and sores and, although this use is now largely superseded by superior antiseptics, it is still used in otolaryngology in the form of bismuth subnitrate iodoform paraffin paste (BIPP) as an antiseptic packing for cavities. It is the active ingredient in many ear powders for dogs and cats, along with zinc oxide and propionic acid, which are used to prevent infection and facilitate removal of ear hair.

<doc id="315030" wikidata="Q1014491" url="?curid=315030" title="Prime knot">
<text>In knot theory, a prime knot or prime link is a knot that is, in a certain sense, indecomposable. Specifically, it is a non-trivial knot which cannot be written as the knot sum of two non-trivial knots. Knots that are not prime are said to be composite knots or composite links. It can be a nontrivial problem to determine whether a given knot is prime or not.

A family of examples of prime knots are the torus knots. These are formed by wrapping a circle around a torus &quot;p&quot; times in one direction and &quot;q&quot; times in the other, where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are coprime integers.

Knots are characterized by their crossing numbers. The simplest prime knot is the trefoil with three crossings. The trefoil is actually a (2, 3)-torus knot. The figure-eight knot, with four crossings, is the simplest non-torus knot. For any positive integer &quot;n&quot;, there are a finite number of prime knots with &quot;n&quot; crossings. The first few values for exclusively prime knots and for prime &quot;or&quot; composite knots are given in the following table.

Enantiomorphs are counted only once in this table and the following chart (i.e. a knot and its mirror image are considered equivalent).


==Schubert&#x27;s theorem==
A theorem due to Horst Schubert (1919–2001) states that every knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.

<text>Allerton is a suburb of Liverpool, in the county of Merseyside, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is located southeast of the city centre and is bordered by the suburbs of Garston, Hunt&#x27;s Cross, Mossley Hill, and Woolton. It has a number of large houses in the prestigious Calderstones Park area, with mainly 1930s semi-detached housing around the shopping area of Allerton Road. It is paired with Hunts Cross to form the Allerton and Hunts Cross city council ward, which had a population of 14,853 at the 2011 census.

==History==
In the Domesday Book, Allerton appears as &quot;Alretune&quot;, meaning &quot;the alder enclosure&quot;. This was derived from the Old English &quot;alr&quot;, meaning &quot;alder&quot;, and &quot;tún&quot;, meaning &quot;enclosure or village&quot;. Allerton was formerly a township in the parish of Childwall, in 1866 Allerton became a separate civil parish, it was made an urban district by the Local Government Act 1894, and added to the county borough of Liverpool on 9 November 1913. On 1 April 1922 the parish was abolished and merged with Liverpool. In 1921 the parish had a population of 2070. Over the course of the 2010s, many new bars and restaurants opened on Allerton Road, increasing its popularity.

==Transport==
Allerton is served by two railway stations: Liverpool South Parkway on the border of Allerton and Garston (with the railway track separating the two suburbs) and West Allerton. Both stations offer services to Liverpool city centre and Manchester, but Liverpool South Parkway also has services to Southport and Hunts Cross (on Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern Line) and also the fast service to Birmingham. The former Allerton railway station has been replaced by Liverpool South Parkway, although the old platforms are in use at the new station.

The nearest major bus stop is at Liverpool South Parkway, with the 86 service to the city centre and bus shuttles to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. There are several bus stops around Aigburth with links to various districts throughout the city and also the city centre.

The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Penny Lane&quot; is set mostly on Allerton Road; the shelter in the middle of the roundabout, the barber shop, and possibly the bank mentioned in the song are all located at the junction of Allerton Road, Penny Lane, and Smithdown Road.

Allerton is featured in the first episode of the BBC drama series &quot;Spooks&quot;, in which pro-life campaigners detonate a bomb outside the home of a family planning doctor.

<text>The Other is a 1972 American horror psychological thriller film directed by Robert Mulligan, adapted for film by Thomas Tryon from his 1971 novel of the same name. It stars Uta Hagen, Diana Muldaur, and twins Chris and Martin Udvarnoky, with Victor French, John Ritter, and Jenny Sullivan in supporting roles.

==Plot==
In 1935 Connecticut, widow Alexandra Perry lives with her identical twin sons, Holland and Niles, on their family farm, overseen by Uncle George and his wife Vee, along with their bratty son Russell. Residing nearby is their Russian emigrant grandmother Ada, with whom Niles shares a close relationship. Ada has taught Niles to astrally project his mind into the bodies of other living creatures, a spiritual ability that runs in the Perry family; they refer to this as &quot;the Game&quot;. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s no innocent game, considering it leads to the freak &quot;accidental&quot; death of Cousin Russell, the paralysis of Alexandra, and a fatal heart attack suffered by their neighbor, Mrs. Rowe. Ada now realizes &quot;the Game&quot; is evil, and advises Niles never to play it again. Further, she forces Niles to admit that Holland has been dead since their eleventh birthday the previous March when he fell down the well, but Niles is unable to accept the truth. Ada realizes that Niles has been using &quot;the Game&quot; to keep his brother alive in his mind in addition to assuming Holland&#x27;s careless and somewhat violent personality, and that, in actuality, Niles is responsible for the summer&#x27;s tragedies.

Later, Niles&#x27; older sister gives birth to a baby girl. Niles adores the child, but &quot;Holland&quot;, whose favorite fairy tale is &quot;The Changeling&quot;, steals his infant niece, replacing her with an angel-shaped lamp. A posse is formed to find the child. But Ada, suspecting the worst, searches the barn for Niles. She discovers him prowling the storage cellar and, speaking to &quot;Holland&quot;, demands the whereabouts of the baby. Meantime, the posse finds the baby drowned in a wine cask, and an alcoholic Italian immigrant farmhand, Mr. Angelini, is accused of the murder. Informed of the discovery and realizing what has happened, Ada decides to sacrifice herself to end &quot;the Game&quot; and Niles&#x27; life; she pours kerosene into the cellar and throws herself onto it with a kerosene lamp, causing an inferno that burns the barn down. But later, when the charred remains of the barn are cleared away, it&#x27;s revealed that Niles escaped the fire due to &quot;Holland&quot; previously cutting the padlock from the cellar door. With Ada dead and his mother a catatonic, paralyzed invalid, no one suspects Niles&#x27; secret. In the film&#x27;s final shot, Niles peers out from his bedroom window while being called downstairs for lunch.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Locations===
The film was shot entirely on location in Murphys, California and Angels Camp, California. Director Robert Mulligan had hoped to shoot the film on location in Connecticut, where it takes place, but because it was autumn when the film entered production (and therefore the color of the leaves would not reflect the height of summer, when the story takes place) this idea was dropped. Assistant director/associate producer Don Kranze picked the location for the house in Murphys, having remembered it from the 1947 film &quot;The Red House&quot;. The fairground sequence was shot in Angels Camp.

===Direction===
Mulligan described his intentions with the film: “I want to put the audience into the body of the boy with this shot and to make the experience of the film, from beginning to end, a totally subjective one.” Of the character of Niles, he commented “If Niles could have life just the way he wanted it, his world would contain only Ada, Holland, and himself—preferably only Holland and himself.&quot; Of the character of Ada, he said “She was the heart of the house. She has a primitive sense of imagination and drama, which is the greatest thing an adult can give a child ... Her only failing is that she has a maternal love so strong that it blinds her to what is happening. Though she enriches and turns on the child’s imagination, her gift is used in a destructive way by the child.”

===Cast===
Mulligan and Tryon pursued Uta Hagen for the role of Ada; Tryon and his then-lover, Clive Clerk, allegedly had to first convince Mulligan that Hagen was right for the part. Mulligan then visited Hagen at her house in Montauk and convinced her to take the role. Tryon specifically asked for Diana Muldaur to play the part of Alexandra, because she reminded him of his own mother. Tryon later stated that although he was happy with the performances by Hagen and the Udvarnoky twins, he was displeased with some of the other casting decisions. Assistant director Don Kranze later recalled that Tryon did not approve of Lou Frizzell in the role of Uncle George, since Frizzell&#x27;s Southern accent didn&#x27;t quite fit the New England origins of the character.

Chris and Martin Udvarnoky auditioned for the roles of Niles and Holland after a grade-school teacher informed their parents about the production. After they were cast, the boys met with Robert Mulligan, who asked them which boy wanted to play Niles and which boy wanted to play Holland; he then gave both boys the roles that they each asked for. In an interview for the video essay &quot;The Making of The Other&quot;, Martin Udvarnoky recalls that Mulligan was mostly a nice director on the set, but that he got a little angry during the filming of a (deleted) swimming scene where the boys were struggling to act due to the cold outdoor weather.

Mulligan never shows the brothers in frame together. They are always separated by a camera pan or an editing cut.

John Ritter made one of his early appearances in the film as the boys&#x27; brother-in-law Rider Gannon. Decades later, on an episode of &quot;8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter&quot;, Ritter paid tribute to Robert Mulligan in a scene where his character quoted &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.

===Music===
Goldsmith&#x27;s compositions for the film can be heard in a 22-minute suite found on the soundtrack album of &quot;The Mephisto Waltz&quot;. This CD was released 25 years after the release of the film. Due to feedback from test screenings, the film was shortened, and much of Goldsmith&#x27;s music was taken out.

===Alternate ending===
When the film aired on CBS in the 1970s, the final shot replaces Winnie&#x27;s line with a voiceover by Niles: &quot;Holland, the game&#x27;s over. We can&#x27;t play the game anymore. But when the sheriff comes, I&#x27;ll ask him if we can play it in our new home.&quot; The voiceover is dubbed by a different child than the actor and may have been edited into the television version to imply that Niles had not gotten away with murder, but was waiting to be taken to a mental health care facility. All subsequent media releases and television broadcasts omit this voiceover in favor of the original theatrical ending.

==Reception==
The film experienced a quiet theatrical run, but it had regular television airings in the late 1970s. Among the film&#x27;s admirers was Roger Ebert, who wrote in his review, the movie &quot;has been criticized in some quarters because Mulligan made it too beautiful, they say, and too nostalgic. Not at all. His colors are rich and deep and dark, chocolatey browns and bloody reds; they aren&#x27;t beautiful but perverse and menacing. And the farm isn&#x27;t seen with a warm nostalgia, but with a remembrance that it is haunted.&quot; After Chris Udvarnoky&#x27;s death on October 25, 2010, Ebert paid tribute to Udvarnoky on his Twitter page.

Tom Tryon, however, was disappointed with the film, despite having written the screenplay. When asked about the film in a 1977 interview, Tryon recalled &quot;Oh, no. That broke my heart. Jesus. That was very sad...That picture was ruined in the cutting and the casting. The boys were good; Uta was good; the other parts, I think, were carelessly cast in some instances--not all, but in some instances. And, God knows, it was badly cut and faultily directed. Perhaps the whole thing was the rotten screenplay, I don&#x27;t know. But I think it was a good screenplay.&quot;

In the same interview, Tryon also hinted that he initially had been considered to direct the film before Mulligan was hired for the job: &quot;It was all step-by-step up to the point of whether I was going to become a director or not. The picture got done mainly because the director who did it wanted to do that property, and he was a known director; he was a known commodity.&quot;

==Legacy==

After &quot;The Other&quot;, Chris and Martin Udvarnoky did some stage work with Uta Hagen, and they both tried out for the lead role in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, but neither got the part. Ultimately, they both decided not to pursue careers acting in movies, partially because they were disturbed by the attention which they received from fans when &quot;The Other&quot; premiered, and also because they preferred to resume normal childhoods.

Chris Udvarnoky became an emergency medical technician. He died of kidney disease in Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 25, 2010 at the age of 49.

In an interview for the video essay &quot;The Making of The Other&quot;, Martin Udvarnoky has reflected that &quot;The Other&quot; &quot;is the kind of movie that either you love, or you don&#x27;t.&quot;

<doc id="315037" wikidata="Q42508" url="?curid=315037" title="Roraima">
<text>Roraima ( ) is one of the 26 states of Brazil. Located in the country&#x27;s North Region, it is the northernmost and most geographically and logistically isolated state in Brazil. It is bordered by the state of Pará to the southeast, Amazonas to the south and west, Venezuela to the north and northwest, and Guyana to the east.

The state covers an area of approximately , slightly larger than Belarus, being the fourteenth largest Brazilian state by area. The city of Boa Vista is the capital and largest city in the state, and is the only capital in the country located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere. Antônio Denarium, a member of the conservative Progressistas party, has been the governor of the state since 2019.

Roraima is the least populous state in Brazil, with an estimated population of 631,181 inhabitants as of 2020. It is also the state with the lowest population density in Brazil, with 2.01 inhabitants per square kilometre. Its economy, based mainly on the tertiary sector, registers a high growth rate, although its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the lowest in the country, with R$ 16.024 billion, representing only 0.20% of the Brazilian economy.

The history of Roraima is strongly linked to the Branco River, which allowed the first Portuguese settlers to arrive in the region. The Branco River Valley&#x27;s strategic position made it coveted by the English and the Dutch, who entered Brazil through the Guiana Shield in search of indigenous people to be enslaved. The Spaniards also came to invade the northern part of the Branco River and the Uraricoera River through Venezuela. The Portuguese settlers defeated and expelled all invaders, establishing Portugal&#x27;s sovereignty over the region of Roraima and part of the Amazonas.

As a result of crisis in Venezuela since the 2010s, Roraima has become the leading entry point for Venezuelan refugees in Brazil. Displaced Venezuelans in Roraima are estimated to number around 100,000, approximately one-sixth of the state&#x27;s population.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; comes from the Pemon language. Its etymology gives it three possible meanings: &quot;Green Peak&quot;, &quot;Mother of the Winds&quot; and &quot;Cashew Mountain&quot;. It would be the junction of &quot;roro&quot; (parrot) and &quot;imã&quot; (father, former). In that language, - or also - means &quot;green&quot;, and means mountain or peak, thus forming the word &quot;Green Peak&quot;, reflecting the natural landscape of that specific region.

There is a possibility that the word &quot;Roraima&quot; has two other meanings: &quot;Mother of the Winds&quot; and &quot;Cashew Mountain&quot;. The first meaning comes from the windy climate in the region, where indigenous people believed that the winds that blew through southern Venezuela came from that place. The second, &quot;Cashew Mountain&quot;, is due to the many mountains and hills that exist in the area.

== History ==

The first Portuguese settlers arrived in the region by the Branco River. Before the arrival of the Portuguese, the English and the Dutch were already attracted to the region, to explore the Branco River Valley through the Guyanas. Portugal&#x27;s sovereignty over the region was only established after the Spaniards invaded the northern part of the Branco River, along with the Uraricoera River. From 1725, Carmelite missionaries began the task of converting the indigenous peoples in the region.

The Portuguese occupation intensified from the 1730s when it traveled the Branco River in search of consolidation of the borders and indigenous labour. For this, they organized rescue troops (purchase of indigenous people transformed into slaves during wars of opposing ethnic groups), war troops (punishment and enslavement of indigenous people who attacked Portuguese nuclei or prevented evangelization) and the search for Brazilian products for sale, the so-called &quot;sertão&quot; drugs. Also, they promoted descents – villages of missionaries and indigenous volunteers or compulsory.

In the middle of the 18th century, the Portuguese Crown became concerned with the constant Spanish expeditions to the western region of the Amazon. Thus, the idea of creating the Royal Captaincy of São José do Rio Negro was considered, which occurred through the Royal Charter of March 3, 1755. The main reason for the creation of the captaincy was the fear of the Spanish threat from the Viceroyalty of Peru, and the arising fear from the Dutch expeditions in Suriname to trade and imprison indigenous peoples.

The demarcations foresaw by the Treaty of Madrid, of 1750, also lead to a great extent: with the creation of a new administrative unit in the region, the intention was to implement, in practice, the colonization of the Upper Negro River, creating the necessary infrastructure for the meeting and the work of the Portuguese and Spanish demarcation committees, and this meeting never took place, having Portuguese moulds temporarily occupied the course of the lower Branco River in the meantime, carrying out plantations of manioc and other food, for the provisioning of the commission.

The São Joaquim Fort, built in 1755 at the confluence of the Uraricoiera River with the Takutu River, was decisive in the conquest of the Branco River by the Portuguese. The Fort, which no longer exists today, had the main purpose of providing the Portuguese with total sovereignty of Portugal over the lands of the Branco River Valley, which aroused international greed due to its little exploitation.

The Portuguese colonizers, after assuming sovereignty and total control of the region, created several villages and towns in the locality, together with indigenous natives. Nossa Senhora da Conceição and Santo Antônio, on the Uraricoera River; São Felipe, on the Takutu River and Nossa Senhora do Carmo and Santa Bárbara, on the Branco River, were the main settlements created at the time, housing a significant population number. However, due to the conflicts between the indigenous and the colonizers, because the indigenous people did not accept to submit to the conditions imposed by the Portuguese, the villages did not develop.

To guarantee the presence of the Portuguese settlers in the lands of the Branco River Valley, commander Manuel da Gama Lôbo d&#x27;Almada started breeding cattle and horses in the territory, in 1789. The farms of São Bento, São José and São Marcos, on the Uraricoera and Takutu rivers, respectively, were the first to permanently introduce cattle and equine breeding, between 1793 and 1799. Currently, the São Marcos farm belongs to the indigenous people and is located in front of the place where Fort São Joaquim was located.

For a year, between 1810 and 1811, English soldiers entered the Valley but were expelled by the commander of São Joaquim Fort. The border between Brazil and Guyana, whose border demarcation process had already been closed, needed to be re-marked, due to the great English invasions that occurred in that period. Therefore, the colonization of the Branco River was divided into four periods: From 1750 to the beginning of the 19th century, with the discovery of the Branco River; from the mid-19th century until the creation of the municipality of Boa Vista, in 1890; from 1890 until the creation of the Federal Territory of Rio Branco; and the creation of the Federal Territory of Rio Branco to elevate it to the category of Brazilian federative unit renamed Roraima.

Decree-Law No. 5,812 of September 13, 1943, which dismembered the state of Amazonas, created the Federal Territory of Rio Branco. In 1962, the territory was called the Federal Territory of Roraima and elevated to the category of Brazilian federative unit by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988.

The colonization of the region was highly encouraged at the end of the 19th century, with the establishment of National Farms. However, the state&#x27;s population only found stability after its emancipation, a century later, with the gold and diamond mines that attracted migratory waves from different regions of the country. This disorderly immigration and exploitation resulted in many conflicts and deaths due to illnesses and murders in the locality. Currently, almost all of the state&#x27;s indigenous reserves are approved.

== Geography ==

Roraima is a state in the North Region of Brazil, being the northernmost state in the Federative Republic of Brazil. It has 1,922 kilometres of border with South American countries. It is bordered by the state of Pará to the southeast for 107 km, Amazonas to the south and west for about 1,200 km partly across the Jufari, Jauaperi and Alalau rivers, Venezuela to the north and northwest for 1,403 km across the Serra Parima and north across the Serra Pacaraima, and Guyana to the east for 964 km. Roraima covers an area of approximately , slightly larger than Belarus, being the fourteenth largest Brazilian state by area.

Approximately of the state is composed of indigenous areas, representing almost half of the state&#x27;s territory (46.37%). The area of environmental preservation in the state, under the responsibility of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), is also extensive, with , 8.42% of Roraima&#x27;s area. For this reason, Roraima is the Brazilian state with the second-highest percentage of territory formed by protected areas, behind only the state of Amapá.

=== Relief ===
Mount Roraima, located in Pacaraima Mountains, is the highest point in the state and one of the highest in the country, with . The relief in the state is quite varied. Near the borders of Venezuela and Guyana are the mountains of Parima and Pacaraima, where Mount Roraima is located, with an altitude of . As it is in the far north of Brazil, its points in the far north are the Uailan River and Mount Caburaí.

Roraima is predominantly flat. About 60% of the area is below , about 25% averages between 200 and 300 metres, 14% from 300 to 900 metres and only 1% has elevations over 900 metres above sea level. There are also two geomorphological structures: the Wavy Plateau and the Northern Escarpments, which are part of the Guiana Shield. Its Wavy Plateau is a large pediplain, formed by isolated and dispersed massifs and peaks.

Because of its variations, the relief is divided into five degrees: The first-degree houses areas of the state that can be flooded, which do not have a specific form of relief, but which are covered by a thin layer of water; the second degree would be the Branco River pediplain, an important unit of enormous expression in the state since it occupies a large part of its lands. In this pediplain, the altitudes vary from 70 to 160 metres and have a low slope towards the river channels. The third degree is formed by elevations that can reach an altitude of 400 metres. There are mountain ranges such as Serra da Lua, Serra Grande, Serra da Batata and others. The fourth degree is characterized by elevations that can vary from 600 to 2,000 metres of altitude, formed mainly by the Pacaraima mountain range, Serra do Parima and Serra do Urucuzeiro. These mountains are joined in the form of chains and the rivers that form the Uraricoera river are born there. Finally, the fifth degree, groups the highest regions, formed by elevations that reach almost 3,000 metres of altitude.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification, the prevailing climate in Roraima is similar to that of other states in the North Region that shelter the Amazon rainforest: basic variations of the tropical climate. The average temperature during the year varies from in points of relief with higher altitudes, to in areas of smooth or flat relief.

The rainfall index in the eastern part is about 2000 millimetres. In the western part, it is approximately 1500 millimetres. In the capital and nearby areas, the indexes reach 2600 millimetres.

In general, the climate varies according to the region. The south and west of the state have a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;). The average annual temperature ranges from . In the north and east, the prevailing climates are the tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) and tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;), where the average temperature is similar to the other regions of the state, however the rainfall index is lower, and the dry season is well defined.

Despite the latitude, in the extreme northwest and northeast, in the highest areas of the state, it is possible to find climatic patterns compatible with those of humid subtropical climates (&quot;Cfa&quot; and &quot;Cwa&quot;), as in the region around Mount Roraima, which has an annual average temperature between , and a dry season between December and March.

=== Hydrography ===

The state of Roraima has extensive hydrography. Its territory is abundantly irrigated by 14 rivers, being these: Água Boa do Univiní, Ailã, Ajarani, Alalaú, Branco, Catrimani, Cauamé, Itapará, Mucajaí, Surumu, Takutu, Uraricoera, Urubu and Xeruini.

The hydrography of Roraima is part of the Amazon River basin and is basically based on the Branco River sub-basin of , the largest and most important in the state. This river is one of the tributaries of the Negro River.

Most of the rivers in the region have a large number of beaches in the summer, ideal for tourism and leisure. Besides, there are rapids rivers located in the north of the state, which are an option for water sports, such as canoeing. Almost all water sources in the state originate within its territory, except for two rivers with springs in Guyana. All Roraiman rivers flow into the Amazon Basin.

=== Fauna and flora ===

The diversity of landscapes and biomes in Roraima contributes to the formation of the fauna in Roraima. In the Roraiman Amazon rainforest region, animals such as &quot;jaguars, tapirs, peccaries, alligators, margay cats, otters, deers, monkeys&quot;, and other species are found.

In the general fields of the Branco River and the savannas, there are &quot;anteaters, armadillos, tortoises, pampas deer, pacas, agouti,&quot; several species of snakes and other species. Among many species, the wild horses stand out, they are called &quot;cavalos lavradeiros&quot; (in English: savannah horses or steppe horses), one of the last populations of wild horses in the world. In the Branco River basin, where most fish species are found, the variety of species is large. Among the main fish are the &quot;pacu, peacock bass, surubi, matrinxã, redtail catfish, tambaqui, acará, mandi, cachorra, piranha, traíra, piraíba, arowana&quot; and many other species.

On the beaches of the lower Branco River, it is still possible to find species of turtles, such as the &quot;yellow-spotted river turtle&quot;. There are many species of birds in the state, from large to small ones. Among the large ones, the &quot;passarão&quot; (literally big bird) and the &quot;jabiru&quot; stand out. Among the small ones, &quot;guans, herons, crested caracara&quot; and others stand out.

In Roraima, the flora is divided into three regions:

* Amazon rainforest &quot;(Floresta tropical amazônica)&quot;: composed of dense and humid forest typical of the lower Branco River, extending through the southwest region.
* General fields of the Branco River &quot;(Campos Gerais do Rio Branco)&quot;: approximately , also known as the lavrado region. Lavrado is also known as the savannah. Formed by grass-plot, but along the watercourses, called &quot;igarapés&quot;, there are large palm trees known as &quot;buritizeiros&quot;. In the lavrado there are also, in great quantity, bushes, paricaranas and muricizeiros.
* Mountainous region &quot;(Região Serrana)&quot;: with typical mountainous vegetation, thinner trees and valleys rich in humus with good-quality grass for livestock.

In any of the regions, there are three different types of vegetation cover taking into account the river banks. These are:

* Mainland forests &quot;(Matas de terra firme)&quot;: comprising forests located in lands never affected by river floods.
* Floodplain forests &quot;(Matas de várzeas)&quot;: these are the forests that cover the lands affected by the floods of rivers.
* Riparian forests &quot;(Matas ciliares)&quot;: these are preserved by law and are also flooded every year by river floods.

== Demography ==

According to the population estimate of 2020 carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Roraima had a population of 631,181 inhabitants, which makes the state the least populous federative unit in Brazil. The capital, Boa Vista, concentrates 66.4% of the state&#x27;s population. The population of Roraima has almost doubled in twenty years. In 1991, the state had only 217,583 inhabitants, a significant increase of 95.51% in population growth. The municipalities that showed the highest population growth were Boa Vista, the capital, and Rorainópolis. As for the annual population growth in Roraima, the state ranks among the fastest-growing in Brazil, with a rate of 4.6%, much higher than the national average of 1.6% growth. In this regard, it is second only to Amapá, which registers more than 5% annual growth. However, this high population growth has been declining in recent years. An example of this is the rate presented in 2000 when Roraima showed 49.09% of population growth with 1991. In the last census, in 2010, that number dropped to 31.13%. Of the total population of the state in 2010, 229,343 inhabitants are men and 221,884 inhabitants are women. In recent years, the growth of the urban population has intensified significantly, exceeding the total rural population. According to the 2000 estimate, 80.3% of the inhabitants lived in cities.

The population density was 1.8 inhab./km2 in 2006. This mark is lower than the Brazilian density, 19.94 inhab./km2. The distribution of the state population is uneven, with a greater concentration in the capital region and the south of the state. Five municipalities – Boa Vista, Rorainópolis, Alto Alegre, Caracaraí and Bonfim – concentrate more than half of the population of Roraima.

In 2017, the Human Development Index (HDI) of Roraima was 0.752, considered high and placing the state in 12th position among the 26 states in Brazil.


=== Ethnicity ===

Cultural, political and economic traits inherited from the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch are influential in Roraima. Also, the importance of the indigenous peoples in terms of ethnic contribution cannot be forgotten. It was the indigenous people who initiated human occupation in the Amazon region, and their descendants, the &quot;caboclos&quot;, developed in close contact with the environment, adapting to the regional peculiarities and opportunities offered by the forest.

In its historical formation, the Roraiman demography is the result of the miscegenation of the three basic ethnic groups that make up the population in the state: the Indigenous, the Europeans and the Africans, thus forming the mestizos of the region (&quot;caboclos&quot;). Later, with the arrival of migrants, especially from the Northeast of Brazil, a &quot;broth&quot; of singular culture was formed, which characterizes a large part of the population, its values and way of life.

According to the 2022 census, the total population of Roraima was composed of &quot;Pardos&quot; (mixed-race, 57.3%), Whites (20.7%), Indigenous (14.1%), Afro-Brazilians (7.7%) and Asians (0.1%). Roraima also recognizes mestizo identity. Mestizo Day (June 27) is an official date in the state.

=== Religion ===

According to data from 2010, from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the main religious denominations of Roraima were: Catholicism (50.5%), Protestantism (30.3%), no religion (12.98%), Indigenous religions (2.75%), Spiritism (0.91%), Buddhism (0.13%), Candomblé (0.08%), Esoteric traditions (0.03%), Judaism and Islam (0.03% each), Umbanda (0.02%) and Hinduism (0.01%). The Roman Catholic Diocese of Roraima with 22 parishes under Bishop Evaristo Pascoal Spengler (2023), a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Manaus, is the only Catholic diocese in the state of Roraima. It belongs to the Ecclesiastical Province of Manaus and the Northern Regional Episcopal Council of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil. The episcopal see is in the Cristo Redentor Cathedral, in the city of Boa Vista. In addition to the majority Catholic Church, there are dozens of different Protestant denominations in the state. In recent years, Eastern religions, Mormonism and evangelical denominations have grown considerably in the state. Among the Christian restorationist denominations, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.55%) and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (0.15%) stand out. Among the new Eastern religions, the Church of World Messianity stands out (0.06%). Other beliefs are shared by 1.47% of the population.

=== Education ===
In 2009, the state had a network of 585 elementary schools, of which 322 are state schools, 252 municipal, 10 private and 1 federal public school. The teaching staff consisted of 4,842 teachers, of whom 2,952 worked in state public schools, 1,627 in municipal public schools and 217 in private schools. 86,547 students studied in these schools, of which 82,208 in public schools and 4,339 in private schools. High school was given in 100 establishments, with an enrollment of 17,512 students. Of the 17,512 students, 16,175 were in public schools and 1,337 in private schools.
As for higher education, the Federal University of Roraima (UFRR), the State University of Roraima (UERR) and the Federal Institute of Roraima (IFRR) stand out. There are also private Higher Education establishments: Roraiman College of Higher Education (FARES), Estácio Atual College, Cathedral College and Faculty of Sciences, Education and Theology of Northern Brazil (FACETEN).

About 14,500 pre-school students were also registered, divided into 270 teaching units. Of these, 258 were municipal, with none at the state level. There were 857 pre-school teachers in the state.

In 2019 the illiteracy rate in the state was 5%, placing Roraima in the 7th position among the states of Brazil with the highest percentage of literate population, ahead of all states in the North and Northeast regions. In 2019, in the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB), the state reached a score of 5.7 points, being higher than the national average and becoming the 15th position among the Brazilian states.

In 2011, the average grade of Roraima in the National High School Exam (ENEM) is 35.03 in the objective test and 56.37 in the essay test, being one of the highest scores in the North-Northeast of Brazil. In these two regions, Roraima lost only to Amazonas (57.77). However, even with the second highest score, the Roraiman average was below the national average, which was 57.26. Regarding the number of students, 7,463 participated in ENEM in 2010, of which 2,404 were high school graduates and 4,493 graduates. 85.52% of the total students came from public schools.

A survey carried out by Portal G1 identified Roraima as one of the Brazilian states that best remunerates middle school teachers, with an average salary of R$ 2,099.47 for 25 hours per week. According to the survey, the highest salary in the country, in the Federal District – in the amount of R $3,121.96 – was related to a workload of 40 hours. In the same year, the NGO Todos pela Educação also mentioned Roraima as the second Brazilian state with the highest investment in basic education students per year, with R$4,834.43, for each student.

=== Health care ===
In 2005, there were 455 hospital establishments in the state, with 725 beds and 56 doctors, 10 graduated nurses and 60 nursing assistants. In 2010, of the 455 existing hospitals, 378 were for adults and children, 22 were exclusively for children, being 49 general and 3 specialized. In 2005, 85.2% of the population of Roraima had access to the water network, while 75% benefited from the sanitary sewage network.

According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, 81.4% of the population of Roraima rated their health as good or excellent; 72.5% of the population regularly undergo medical consultations; 44.9% of the inhabitants consulted the dentist regularly and 7.4% of the population has been hospitalized in the last twelve months. Approximately 22% of the inhabitants declared to have a chronic disease and only 9.8% have health insurance. Another significant fact is the fact that 44.7% of the inhabitants declare that they always need the Family Health Unit Program (PUSF).

Regarding women&#x27;s health, 30.5% of women over 40 years old had a clinical breast exam in the last twelve months; 39.1% of women between 50 and 69 years old had a mammogram in the last twenty-four months, and 85.6% of women between 25 and 59 years old had a preventive exam for cervical cancer in the last thirty-six months.

== Economy ==

With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of only R$ 13,37 billion, the economy of the state of Roraima is the smallest in Brazil, corresponding to only 0.2% of Brazil&#x27;s economy. It is based on agricultural production, mainly in grain agribusiness, with emphasis on rice, soybeans and corn. It is said that the state works in the so-called &quot;paycheck economy&quot;, when there is a circulation mainly of the amounts paid in salaries to public servants and private employees of commerce.

In livestock, the live cattle trade for slaughter in Manaus was, until the 1970s, the main economic base. For years, between 6 and 10 thousand oxen were traded with Manaus annually. This type of trade brought foodstuffs, clothing, household items, among others, to Roraima. This form of supply ended due to two main factors: population growth in the state, through the inauguration of the Manaus–Boa Vista Road, and the decrease in the cattle herd.

Rice took the place of meat, starting to be traded with Manaus in the late 1970s. In 1977, agricultural mechanization for rice crop was introduced, increasing production capacity. In the beginning, mechanization was applied in the area of plowing for the production of upland rice, which did not have the success expected by several factors. One of them was the lack of physical structure for storing production, as there were no dryers and warehouses. However, this system made it possible to shift production to irrigated rice. With more capitalized producers and government support in the construction of warehouses and dryers, production became viable. This type of rice came to be produced in the floodplains of the Branco, Takutu, Uraricoera and Cauamé rivers, with productivity high enough to cover the high costs of implanting and maintaining this crop in Roraima.

Subsequently, the cultivation of soybeans appeared in the plowing, with the planted area being increased year by year. The biggest problems of this crop are in the area of guaranteeing land tenure, its incompatibilities with environmental laws, in addition to irregularity and poor reliability of transport. These two largest crops in Roraima decreased with the conquest by the peoples from the Demarcation of the Raposa Serra do Sol Indigenous Area.

Other crops such as corn, cassava and beans are also present. But they do not reach the level of rice and soy production. In the case of manioc for the production of flour, Roraima is self-sufficient. In the area of fruit growing, pineapple, orange, banana, papaya, melon, watermelon, grape, lemon, passion fruit and tangerine are produced in the state. The melon, watermelon and papaya stand out for their quality recognition. There has been great progress with vegetables in recent years. The production of lettuce, green onions, parsley, peppers, sweet potatoes, string beans, pumpkin, cabbage and sweet pepper have increased, and it can be said that there is also self-sufficiency in this sector. Greenhouse production has helped in this process.

Roraima has always occupied a secondary position in the economic geography of the Amazon when it comes to plant extractivism, producing Brazil nuts, rowanberries and wood. The first two in the southern region of the state, especially under the Branco River. They are sold in Manaus, but on a small scale. The wood has been explored and traded with Venezuela and, more recently, with other countries in Europe and Asia.

The Roraiman industry is small. In the Industrial District of Boa Vista, located on the edge of the BR-174, there were 58 plants in operation in 2015. They produce cereals, wood, leather, and others. The commercial sector is traditional, buying from other places, such as São Paulo and Manaus, and reselling in Boa Vista and other municipalities.

Getting closer commercially with neighboring countries to practice foreign trade is a path that has been recently traced. The main trading partner for exports and imports is Venezuela; the main product exported in 2004 and 2010 was wood; in 2015, there was a good diversification with the export of soy, leather and mineral water, in addition to wood. The products imported in greater quantity have been machines, devices and mechanical instruments. The municipalities that export the most are Boa Vista, Bonfim, Caracaraí, Mucajaí and Rorainópolis.

== Politics ==

Roraima is a state of Brazil governed by three powers, the executive, represented by the governor, the legislative, represented by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Roraima, and the judiciary, represented by the Court of Justice of the State of Roraima and other courts and judges. Popular participation in government decisions through referendums is also allowed. The current constitution of the state of Roraima was enacted on December 31, 1991, in addition to the changes resulting from subsequent constitutional amendments.

The Roraima Executive Branch is centered on the state governor, who is elected by universal suffrage and direct and secret vote, by the population for terms of up to four years in duration, and can be reelected for another term. The Senador Hélio Campos Palace is the seat of the Roraima government since 1991.

The Legislative Power of Roraima is unicameral, constituted by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Roraima. It consists of 24 deputies, who are elected every 4 years. In the National Congress, the representation of Roraima is made up of 3 senators and 8 federal deputies. The highest court of the Roraima Judiciary is the Court of Justice of the State of Roraima. The judiciary is made up of judges and judges of law.

When it comes to political representation organizations, 34 of the 35 Brazilian political parties have representation in the state. According to information released by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), based on data from April 2016, the political party with the largest number of affiliates in Roraima is the Progressive Republican Party (PRP), with 6,732 members, followed by the Social Democracy Party (PSDB), with 5,356 members and the Democratic Labor Party (PDT), with 5,087 members. Other political parties in the state, by number of members, are the Progressive Party (PP), with 4,521 members; and the Workers&#x27; Party (PTB), with 3,406 members. Also according to the Superior Electoral Court, the Sustainability Network (REDE) and the Unified Socialist Workers Party (PSTU) are the least representative political parties in Roraima, with 21 and 24 members, respectively. The New Party (NOVO) is the only Brazilian party that has no representation in Roraima.

=== Subdivisions ===

Roraima is politically divided into 15 municipalities. The most populous of them is Boa Vista, with 419,652 inhabitants, being the oldest municipality in the state, emerged as a village, the first with urban characteristics in Roraima. The municipalities are distributed in four immediate geographical regions, which in turn are grouped into two intermediate geographical regions, according to the division of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in force since 2017.

== Transportation ==

=== Airways ===

In the state, there is only one international airport managed by Infraero, Boa Vista International Airport - Atlas Brasil Cantanhede, located in the state capital. In 2009, the airport in the state capital handled 190,469 passengers and 931,248 air cargo. The state also has 7 other state-class and smaller airports: Auaris Airport, in Amajari; Mucajaí Airport, in Mucajaí; Pacaraima Airport, in Pacaraima; Surucucu, Uaicas and Surucucus Airport, in Alto Alegre, the latter located inside the Yanomami Indigenous Territory; and Caracaraí Airport, in Caracaraí. These airports are of municipal and state administration.

Air transport is the fastest to regulate in Roraima, being in better conditions than the others. The cities, districts and towns of the inland of Roraima are served, in most cases, by transport from Boa Vista. That said, it is the most isolated federative unit in Brazil. There is no rail network in the state.

=== Highways ===

The only Brazilian state that has a road connection with Roraima is Amazonas, through the BR-174, which connects the municipalities in the South to the municipalities in the North of the state, and is also responsible for connecting Brazil to Venezuela. The BR-174 is long and crosses the territory of the state from south to north, crossing the Branco River at the height of Caracaraí through the Caracaraí Bridge.

There is also the BR-210, also called Perimetral Norte, a project originating in the mid-twentieth century, from the Federal Government, which had been carried out only partially and which, in principle, would link the state to Pará, Amapá and the municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira (in Amazonas). This highway is long and crosses the state in an east–west direction. Another highway in Roraima that crosses Brazil is the BR-401, connecting the state with Guyana. It starts in Boa Vista and crosses the Branco River through the Macuxis&#x27; Bridge, entering the Guyanese territory. Other federal highways are BR-431, BR-432 and BR-433. Federal roads in Roraima add up to .

There are state highways as well, including the RR-205 (which connects the capital to the headquarters of Alto Alegre) and the RR-203 (connecting the headquarters and districts of Amajari to the BR-174), both of which are fully paved, signposted, and with good traffic conditions. Other important highways are the RR-325 and the RR-319, which cut through important agricultural areas and colonies of rural settlements. State highways add up to just over in length and are largely in conditions of improper use.

=== Waterways ===

River transport is also notable in the state, as well as in other states in the Amazon rainforest. However, river navigation is limited to the Branco River. Transportation on the Branco River is heavily used for the economy, but with little passenger movement to inland cities. Regular navigation on this river occurs only in the mouth section (Negro River/Caracaraí), about long. In this segment, the Branco River has a maximum draft of 5 metres in the period of floods and a minimum of 0.7 metres in the period of drought. Roraima is at a disadvantage in relation to the other Amazonian states in terms of waterway system. As it is the only one in which all its notorious rivers have their source in their own territory – the state&#x27;s hydrographic system is 100% Roraiman –, it is bound to have few river outlets. In fact, Roraima has only one major fluvial outlet: through the Branco river, reaching the Negro river, heading from there to Manaus and São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Even so, the most important river in Roraima still poses additional difficulties.

== Tourism ==
Roraima has great tourism potential, especially in ecotourism. Because it is located in the extreme north of Brazil, in the northern part of this country and because it borders on three South American countries, Roraima maintains close commercial relations based on tourism with these countries, especially Venezuela. Natural attractions are the main tourist points of the state, especially Mount Roraima. Mount Roraima is one of the oldest places on the planet and attracts many tourists from all over the world.

Archaeologists have a strong interest in Pedra Pintada, which is the most important site of archaeology in the state. In it, there are inscriptions of ancient civilizations, such as rock paintings, pieces of ceramics, hatchets, necklace beads, among other artifacts that indicate the history of human evolution, dating back to four thousand years. The rock is a granite monolith sixty metres in diameter and about 40 metres high. On the outer face, there are red rock paintings that are still considered an enigma for scientists. There are also funerary caves up to 12 meters long. Pedra Pintada is located in Pacaraima.

Serra do Tepequém is also a state tourist attraction. It has a rich handicraft in soapstone and its area is free to explore diamonds. The place serves as a trekking practice, to the Paiva, Sobral, Barata and Funil waterfalls. The plateau is the culmination of the entire mountain, where the mountain range that delimits the borders between Brazil and Venezuela begins. It has an average altitude of 1,500 metres and is located in the municipality of Amajari. Another tourist spot in the state is Mount Caburaí. Geographers have proven that it is located 70 km north of Oiapoque, Amapá, which makes the mountain the northernmost point in Brazil, having been recognized by the official institutions responsible for geographic territorial demarcations, such as the Ministry of Education and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

Also noteworthy is Lake Caracaranã, in the municipality of Normandia. With almost 6 kilometres of perimeter, it is known for its fine sand beaches surrounded by cashew trees.

<text>Sarah Harrison (born 1990), also known as LadyInTheTrap (LITT), is an English-Maltese DJ and singer.

==Early life==
Born in Malta, Harrison began her career as a child, hosting a children&#x27;s television show on ONE TV in Malta. At the age of 12, she moved to London, where she began attending the Sylvia Young Theatre School.

At the age of 13, she represented Malta at the inaugural Junior Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen, Denmark. She performed the self-written song &quot;Like a Star&quot;, which placed 7th.

In 2006, she featured as one of the subjects of the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;My Crazy Life&quot;. An episode in the series followed Harrison&#x27;s quest for fame and her family&#x27;s sacrifices to support her. She later attended Laine Theatre Arts College. 

She appeared as an extra in two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films and was part of an ensemble that recorded sessions at Abbey Road studios for the Disney and Walden Media film version of CS Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.

==Radio ==

Her interest in producing was boosted by a meeting with Quincy Jones. Her first break came in early 2012, after she was contacted by Snoop Dogg after he heard her tracks on SoundCloud. 

She became host of a self-titled weekly radio show, &quot;The Sarah Harrison Show&quot;, on The Beat London 103.6 FM. Harrison made trips to the US to host DJ for the International Music Conference in Atlanta. 

Alongside a Nike Town residency, she has opened for The Game and Ciara, and been a part of the Wireless line-up.

<text>Wewelsburg () is a Renaissance castle located in the village of Wewelsburg, which is a district of the town of Büren, Westphalia, in the &quot;Landkreis&quot; of Paderborn in the northeast of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The castle has a triangular layout, with three round towers connected by massive walls. After 1934, it was used by the SS under Heinrich Himmler, and was to be expanded into a complex which would serve as the central SS cult-site.

After 1941, plans were developed to enlarge it to be the so-called &quot;Centre of the World&quot;. In 1950, the castle reopened as a museum and youth hostel. (The youth hostel is one of the largest in Germany.) The castle today hosts the Historical Museum of the Prince Bishopric of Paderborn and the Wewelsburg 1933–1945 Memorial Museum.

==History ==

===Earlier structures===
Predecessor buildings existed. One of these, the Wifilisburg, was defended during the 9th and 10th centuries against the Hungarians.

Count built another predecessor fortification. In 1123/24, after his death, peasants whom he had oppressed demolished the building. In 1301, the Count of Waldeck sold the Wewelsburg to the Prince-Bishop of Paderborn.

A document concerning this acquisition indicates that two fortresslike buildings stood on the hill, the &quot;Bürensches Haus&quot; and the &quot;Waldecksches Haus&quot;.

===Current structure===

====Prince-bishops of Paderborn ====
From 1301 to 1589, the prince-bishops of Paderborn assigned the estate to various liege lords.

The masonry of both predecessor buildings was integrated in the current triangular Renaissance castle. In its current form, the Wewelsburg was built from 1603 to 1609 as secondary residence for the prince-bishops of Paderborn, at that time . Its location is near what was then believed to be the site of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest of 9 CE.

The Wewelsburg was taken several times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1646, it was occupied and then razed by Swedish troops, by the army commanded by General Carl Gustav Wrangel. After 1650, the mostly destroyed castle was rebuilt by Prince-Bishop Theodor Adolf von der Recke and his successor Ferdinand von Fürstenberg. He carried out some architectural changes; the three towers of the castle got their baroque domes.

From 1589 to 1821, the castle was the place of residence of a bursary officer (or steward). Two witch trials took place in the Wewelsburg in 1631 (a former inquisition room is placed in the basement next to the east tower).

During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the basement rooms were probably used as a military prison.

====Prussian state ownership====
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the castle fell progressively into ruin. In 1802, during German mediatisation, the castle came into the possession of the Prussian state. On 11 January 1815, the North Tower was gutted by a fire that was started by a lightning strike; only the outer walls remained. From 1832 to 1934, a rectory existed in the eastern part of the south wing of the castle.

====District of Büren ownership====
In 1924, the castle became the property of the district of Büren and was changed into a cultural center. By 1925, the castle had been renovated into a local museum, banquet hall, restaurant and youth hostel.

At the end of the Twenties, the North Tower again proved to be the weak point of the architecture, and had to be supported by guy wires in winter 1932/33; the preservation of the castle was supported by the &quot;Club for the preservation of the Wewelsburg&quot; (&quot;Verein zur Erhaltung der Wewelsburg&quot;). After 1925, the renovation activities decreased.

== Nazi era ==
In 1932, the local head of the district authority (&quot;Landrat&quot;) ordered about seventy members of the &quot;Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst&quot; (FAD), (voluntary labour service), to be housed at the Wewelsburg. They were unemployed and supported by the state as &quot;Notstandsarbeiter&quot; (literally: &quot;crisis workers&quot;). Through the rent, the district of Büren thus hoped to recoup some of the running costs of the castle. However, in early 1933, negotiations to set up a full-sized camp for 214 FAD participants failed.

Prior to the Nazi Party taking power, Heinrich Himmler, as &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, had decided that the SS should have a retreat at a castle &quot;in the heartland of Hermann der Cherusker&quot; (Armin the Cheruscian). Initially, Himmler showed an interest in , but negotiations failed in early 1933; he then visited Wewelsburg, at the suggestion of a local Nazi leader, Adolf (1877-1953).

Himmler decided to buy or lease the castle on his first visit on 3 November 1933. His architect, Hermann Bartels, was able to draw on existing plans for the FAD camp, for the now envisaged &quot;Reichsführerschule SS&quot; (SS Leadership School). This school was mainly intended to ensure a unified ideological training of the SS leadership and would be run by the &quot;Rasseamt&quot; of the SS.

Negotiations were difficult, however, since the &quot;Landrat&quot; of Büren was unwilling to give up control of the castle. In the first half of 1934, a 100-year lease was agreed for the symbolic annual rent of ℛℳ1. Initial work on the school by the FAD had started in January 1934. That August, Manfred von Knobelsdorf, a brother-in-law of Walther Darré and former professional soldier, moved in with his family as &quot;Burghauptmann&quot;. Himmler officially took over the Wewelsburg in a large ceremony on 22 September 1934. The &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, in reporting on the event, while mentioning the Germanic and historic past of the region, emphasized the educational aspects.

In 1935, Himmler announced that the SS-castle was to be officially called &quot;SS-Schule Haus Wewelsburg&quot; (&quot;SS School, House Wewelsburg&quot;). The focus of the school was to become: &quot;Germanische Vor- und Frühgeschichte, Volkstumskunde u. a. als Rüstzeug zur weltanschaulich-politischen Schulung&quot; (i.e. &quot;Germanic pre- and early history, folklore studies, etc. as an equipment for ideological-political training&quot;). Knobelsdorff envisioned a kind of Nordic academy.

There is some speculation that it was Karl Maria Wiligut who convinced Himmler to use the castle not only as a school but also as a cult site; Wiligut allegedly was inspired by the old Westphalian legend of the &quot;Battle at the Birch Tree&quot; (&quot;Schlacht am Birkenbaum&quot;). The saga tells about a future &quot;last battle at the birch tree&quot;, in which a &quot;huge army from the East&quot; is beaten decisively by the &quot;West&quot;. During 1935, Wiligut reportedly predicted to Himmler that the Wewelsburg would be the &quot;bastion&quot;. Himmler expected a big conflict between Asia and Europe.

===Wewelsburg SS School ===
Knobelsdorf led the &quot;SS School, House Wewelsburg&quot;. But very quickly the focus of activity shifted away from schooling the SS leadership in a broad set of ideological fields to something much narrower. In fact, work concentrated more on conducting basic pseudo-scientific research in the fields of Germanic pre- and early history, medieval history, folklore and genealogy (&quot;Sippenforschung&quot;), all intended to provide the underpinnings for the racial teachings of the SS. A scientific library was established. But even the first plans by Bartels from early 1934 did not show any large-scale class rooms, only smaller cell-like rooms for individual study. Among those active at the Wewelsburg was Wilhelm Teudt.

====Fields of activity====
Wewelsburg Castle was also a centre for archaeological excavations in the region. Fields of activity included study of prehistory and ancient history (directed by Wilhelm Jordan, who led excavations in the region), study of medieval history and folklife (directed by Karlernst Lasch from March 1935), build-up of the &quot;Library of the Schutzstaffel in Wewelsburg&quot; (directed by Dr. Hans Peter des Coudres), and strengthening the National Socialist worldview in the village of Wewelsburg (directed by Walter Franzius).

This latter activity included such work as renovation of a timbered house in the center of the village of Wewelsburg – the &quot;Ottens Hof&quot; – between 1935 and 1937 for use as a village community center. Franzius also undertook various other architectural tasks.

====Crew====
The castle crew consisted of members of all SS branches, the &quot;General SS&quot; (&quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;), the police and the &quot;Armed SS&quot; (&quot;Waffen-SS&quot;). Also working at the castle were proponents of a kind of SS esotericism consisting of Germanic mysticism, an ancestor cult, worship of runes, and racial doctrines. Himmler, for example, adapted the idea of the Grail to create a heathen mystery for the SS.

====Redesign and reconstruction====
No proof exists that Himmler wanted a Grail castle, but redesign of the castle by the SS referred to certain characters in the legends of the Grail: for example, one of the arranged study rooms was named &quot;Gral&quot; (&quot;Grail&quot;), and others, &quot;König Artus&quot; (&quot;King Arthur&quot;), &quot;König Heinrich&quot; (&quot;King Henry&quot;, referring to Henry the Fowler to whom Himmler claimed a connection), &quot;Heinrich der Löwe&quot; (&quot;Henry the Lion&quot;), &quot;Widukind&quot;, &quot;Christoph Kolumbus&quot; (&quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;), &quot;Arier&quot; (&quot;Aryan&quot;), &quot;Jahrlauf&quot; (&quot;course of the seasons&quot;), &quot;Runen&quot; (&quot;runes&quot;), &quot;Westfalen&quot; (&quot;Westphalia&quot;), &quot;Deutscher Orden&quot; (&quot;Teutonic Order&quot;), &quot;Reichsführerzimmer&quot; (&quot;Room of the Empire&#x27;s Leader(s)&quot;; &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, or &quot;the Reich&#x27;s Leader of the SS&quot; was Himmler&#x27;s title), &quot;Fridericus&quot; (probably in reference to Frederick II of Prussia), &quot;tolle Christian&quot; (&quot;Christian the Great&quot;, probably referring to Christian the Younger of Brunswick, Bishop of Halberstadt), and &quot;Deutsche Sprache&quot; (&quot;German language&quot;). In addition to these study rooms, the SS created guest rooms, a dining room, an auditorium, a canteen kitchen, and a photographic laboratory with an archive.

Oak was used to panel and furnish these rooms, though (according to contemporary witnesses) only sparingly. All interior decoration was shaped by an SS sensibility in art and culture; the preferred elements of design were based on runes, swastikas, and Germanically interpreted &quot;Sinnzeichen&quot; (sense characters). Tableware, decorated with runes and Germanic symbols of salvation, was manufactured specifically for Wewelsburg Castle, and Himmler&#x27;s private collection of weapons was housed in the castle.

In 1934, the eastern castle bridge was built and the castle moat lowered. The exterior plaster was removed to make the building look more castle-like. The following year, a smithy was established on the ground floor of the North Tower for manufacture of the wrought-iron interior decoration of the castle. The western and southern wings of the castle were rebuilt between 1934 and 1938; the eastern, between 1936 and 1938. The first new building, the guardhouse (&quot;Wachgebäude&quot;), was constructed next to the castle in 1937. An SS sentry post and a small circular location (&quot;Rondell&quot;) were placed next to the guardhouse, as was a no longer extant SS staff building (&quot;SS-Stabsgebäude&quot;). The North Tower was strengthened and rebuilt between 1938 and 1943.

From 1939, the castle was also furnished with miscellaneous objects of art, including prehistoric objects (chiefly arranged by the teaching and research group Das Ahnenerbe), objects of past historical eras, and works of contemporary sculptors and painters (mainly works by such artists as Karl Diebitsch, Wolfgang Willrich, and Hans Lohbeck – that is, art in line with the aesthetics of National Socialism).

====Directors====
The first commandant of the castle (&quot;Burghauptmann von Wewelsburg&quot;), from August 1934, was SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; (Lieutenant Colonel) Manfred von Knobelsdorff. He was partial to Karl Maria Wiligut&#x27;s religious theories. The opinion of other SS-scientists about Wiligut were absolutely negative. SS-&quot;Obersturmbannfuhrer&quot; von Knobelsdorff was succeeded by Siegfried Taubert on 30 January 1938. Because Taubert was consigned to various other tasks he was absent from the castle for longer periods.

====Other activities====
So-called &quot;SS-marriage-consecrations&quot; (&quot;SS-Eheweihen&quot;) took place at the castle.

Since 1936, Himmler (who was often present at the castle) wanted more and more to expand the Wewelsburg to be a representative and ideological center of the SS Order. Consequently, although at first planned to be an educational training center, during the 1930s increasing measures were taken to transform the castle into an isolated central meeting place for the highest ranking SS-officers.

====Financing====
For financing the project, Himmler founded in 1936 the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung und Pflege deutscher Kulturdenkmäler e.V.&quot; (Association for the advancement and maintenance of German cultural relics (registered association)) and assigned the association as building developer. In contrast to the SS, the association was allowed to receive donations and loans. Until 1943, the project cost .

====Bans on visitation and publication====
On 6 November 1935, Himmler forbade visiting the castle without express permission. In 1939, he further forbade publishing anything about the castle.

====Construction and modifications after 1938====
After the &quot;Freiwilliger Arbeitsdienst&quot; (the &quot;FAD&quot;, &quot;Voluntary Labour Service&quot;) ceased work on Wewelsburg, the &quot;Reichsarbeitsdienst&quot; (the &quot;RAD&quot;, &quot;Reich Labour Service&quot;) carried out modifications to the castle; but in 1938, the RAD was relocated to the &quot;Westwall&quot; (Siegfried Line). Between 1939 and 1943, prisoners from the Sachsenhausen and Niederhagen concentration camps were used as labourers to perform much of the construction work on Wewelsburg, under the design of architect Hermann Bartels. However, by a decree of 13 January 1943, all building projects which were unimportant for the war – including the Wewelsburg – had to be stopped.

In 1938, after &quot;Reichskristallnacht&quot;, 17 Jews from Salzkotten, ten kilometers (about six miles) distant, were held in the dungeon of the Wewelsburg before transportation to the Buchenwald concentration camp.

In the middle of the 1930s, Himmler had a private safe mounted in the basement of the west tower. Only the commandant of the castle knew about it. The whereabouts of its content after the Second World War is unclear.

==== Meetings of SS-Leaders ====
Swearing-in ceremonies were planned at the castle. Meetings of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; (equivalent to lieutenant-generals) at so called &quot;spring conferences&quot; were planned since 1939. Some talks probably took place at Wewelsburg Castle; the only documented &quot;Gruppenführers&quot;&#x27; meeting was held from 12 to 15 June 1941 – one week before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. The highest ranking SS-officers, who planned the SS operation in the Soviet Union or who were intended to be used for the operation, were called up by Himmler. Concrete decisions were not made. The meeting&#x27;s purpose was the ideological preparation of the attendant SS leaders for the campaign.
Another source mentions three or four ceremonies a year of SS leaders which took place at the castle.

Towards the end of the war, Himmler ordered that Wewelsburg Castle should become the &quot;Reichshaus der SS-Gruppenführer&quot; (Reich-House of the SS-Gruppenführer).

===Death&#x27;s head rings ===
In 1938, Himmler ordered the return of all death&#x27;s head rings (German: &quot;Totenkopfringe&quot;) of dead SS-men and officers. They were to be stored in a chest in the castle. This was to symbolize the ongoing membership of the deceased in the SS-Order. The whereabouts of the approximately 11,500 rings after the Second World War is unknown.

=== SS plans ===

Himmler&#x27;s plans included making it the &quot;center of the new world&quot; (&quot;Zentrum der neuen Welt&quot;) following the &quot;final victory&quot;. The monumental estate was never realized; only detailed plans and models exist. The installation of a 15 to 18-meter-high wall in the shape of a three-quarter circle with 18 towers including the actual castle area centred on the North Tower of the castle, 860 m in diameter, was planned. The real purpose of the project was never clearly defined. Inside of this castle area, buildings were planned for the exclusive purposes of the &quot;Reichsführung-SS&quot; (Reich Leadership-SS).

The main road of an SS village was also to be centred on the North Tower of the castle with a diameter of 1270 m. This road was to be connected with three radial roads and gates with the castle area. The residential area was to be placed in the northwest, the centre of the village in the north, and the SS-barracks in the west of the castle area; between the barracks and village a villa colony for higher SS-leaders; in the southwest farmsteads.

In the architectural plans from 1941, the estate had the shape of a spear pointing towards the north; the 2 km long access avenue with four tree rows road looks like a spear shaft with an access to the Rhynern – Kassel Reichsautobahn (freeway) to the south. The plan from 1944 shows the castle as the top of a triangular estate surrounded by further buildings. The plans also included a &quot;Hall of the High Court of the SS&quot; (&quot;Saal des Hohen Gerichtes der SS&quot;), streets, parkways, magnificent buildings, a dam with a power plant, freeway accesses and an airport. 

From 1941 on, (after Hitler&#x27;s successful military campaigns against Poland and France) the architects called the complex the &quot;Center of the World&quot;. It was to be finished within twenty years. The complex was to be a center of the &quot;species-appropriate religion&quot; (&quot;artgemäße Religion&quot;) and a representative estate for the &quot;SS-Führerkorps&quot; (SS leader corps). If the plans had been realized, the entire village of Wewelsburg and adjacent villages would have disappeared. The population was to be resettled. The valley was to be flooded. 250 million Reichsmark were budgeted for the estate.

===North Tower ===
Inside the North Tower, two mythologic designed rooms were created (1938–1943):

The &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot; (SS Generals&#x27; Hall) and the &quot;Gruft&quot; (vault). Their ceilings were cast in concrete and faced with natural stone. On the upper floors a further hall was planned. The axis of this tower was to be the actual &quot;Center of the World&quot; (&quot;Mittelpunkt der Welt&quot;). A preparation for an eternal flame in the vault, a swastika ornament in its zenith, and the so-called &quot;Black Sun&quot; symbol embedded in the floor of the &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot; lie on this axis. Although both rooms appear to have a ceremonial purpose, nothing is known about if, or how, the rooms were ever used.

Where a primary cistern was originally located, a vault after the model of Mycenaean domed tombs was hewn into the rock, possibly to serve as some kind of commemoration of the dead. The room is unfinished. The floor was lowered 4.80 meters. The foundation of the tower was firmed with concrete, and a gas pipe leading to the centre was embedded, suggesting that an eternal flame was probably planned for the centre of this space. Twelve pedestals were placed around the perimeter, each with a wall niche above it; the purpose is unknown.

On the ground floor the &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot; (literally translated: Upper-Group-Leaders-Hall, referring to the original twelve highest ranking SS-generals, called &quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;), a hall with twelve columns joined by a groined vault, twelve window- and door-niches and eight longitudinal windows was created. The room was almost finished; the rebuilding work stopped in 1943. Assumedly it was to serve as a representative hall for the SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. In the centre of the marbled whitish/grayish floor a dark green sun wheel (&quot;Sonnenrad&quot;) is embedded. The axis of the sun wheel consisted of a circular plate of pure gold, which was to symbolize the center of the castle and thus the entire &quot;Germanic world empire&quot;.

Since the 1990s, the ornament has been called the &quot;Black Sun&quot; occasionally. It is not known if the SS had a special name for the ornament nor if they attributed a special meaning to it. Possibly the sun wheel had a relation to the Germanic light- and sun-mysticism which was propagated by the SS. Today, it is used as a symbol in Neo-Nazism and in a variety of subcultures. However, the ornament has only been linked to the esoteric neo-Nazi concept of the Black Sun after 1991. The Latin inscription above the entrance &quot;Domus mea domus orationis vocabitur&quot; (&quot;My house shall be called a house of prayer&quot;) reminds of the prince-episcopalian chapel which was originally located on the ground floor of the tower.

The upper floors were to be completed as a multi-storied hall with a big dome. It was to be a prestigious meeting hall for the entire corps of the SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot;. This room was only planned. In order to realize the hall the upper half of the tower was dismantled in winter 1941/42.

=== Blasting operation ===
When the &quot;final victory&quot; failed to materialize, the castle commander (or &quot;Burghauptmann&quot;), SS General Siegfried Taubert, fled on 30 March 1945 as the U.S. 3rd Armored Division closed in on the Paderborn area in the final phases of the war. Meanwhile, at his headquarters in Brenzlau, Himmler ordered adjutant SS Major Heinz Macher, with 15 of his men, to destroy the Wewelsburg. This took place on Saturday 31 March only three days before the 83rd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Armored Division seized the grounds after reports from a nearby &quot;Bürgermeister&quot; that &quot;SS men had set fire to their barracks in the castle, changed into civilian clothes and fled.&quot;

Because Macher&#x27;s company ran out of explosives, they placed tank mines only in the unimportant southeast tower, the guard-building and the SS-cadre-building which was completely destroyed. The castle was set on fire and – according to information of the village citizens – the castle was open to looting.

=== Legends and interpretations ===
* According to rumours, the Death&#x27;s Head Rings were to be buried in the vault. The vault, allegedly dubbed the &quot;Himmler Crypt&quot;, was (allegedly) dedicated to Heinrich I, founder and first king of the medieval German state (see East Francia), of whom Himmler reportedly believed himself to be the reincarnation and where he hoped to be interred after his death. This assertion is unproven. In Himmler&#x27;s opinion, Heinrich I protected Germany from invaders from the &quot;East&quot;, as popularized in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; opera.
* Leading representatives of the Third Reich were fascinated by the story of the &quot;Holy Grail&quot;. Hitler admired Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Hitler himself never visited the castle.
* Himmler reportedly imagined the castle as a focus for the rebirth of the Knights of the Round Table and appointed twelve SS officers as his followers, who would gather at various rooms throughout the castle and perform unknown neo-Paganistic and possibly neo-Gnostic rites. The SS had twelve main departments (SS-Hauptämter) with twelve leaders. The number twelve plays a major role in the design of the North Tower: twelve pedestals in the vault, twelve pillars and niches in the &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot;, and twelve spokes of the sun wheel. In the study on ancient sense characters during the Third Reich, the sun in general was interpreted as &quot;the strongest and most visible expression of God&quot;, the number twelve as documented for &quot;the things of the target and the completion&quot;. With reference to the number 12 in their studies on Germanic mythology a relation was drawn to &quot;the twelve Æsir of divine kind who have (according to the Edda) twelve domiciles and twelve stallions&quot; and to the &quot;twelve rivers which flow from the fountain &quot;Hwergelmir&quot; in Niflheim&quot;.
Quote of former SS-General Karl Wolff referring to the &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot;: &quot;This was a part of the myth which was to be introduced here. These are the twelve compartments(*), they were created according to mystic-confused things with which Himmler liked to play, of the Round Table of King Arthur. In fact we were twelve main department leaders (&quot;Hauptamtchefs&quot;) who represented equally next to each other their service areas because Himmler didn&#x27;t have the courage to appoint a Deputy-Reichsführer-SS or a Deputy Chief of the German police.&quot;
(* German original sound record: &quot;Postamente&quot;: this could refer to the twelve columns; there is also speculation about twelve heraldic emblems for the twelve leading SS Generals which were to be placed inside the hall.)
* Allegedly the &quot;Obergruppenführersaal&quot; has similarities with the Mausoleum of Theodoric in Ravenna
* When one of the officers died, his ashes would be interred in the castle. There is speculation that the urns of dead SS leaders would have been placed on the pedestals in the vault. The vault is also named &quot;consecration-hall&quot; (Weihehalle).
* The exact meaning of the vault is unknown. Nevertheless, the room is significant for the quasi-religious aspects of National Socialism – especially the ancestral cult. A possible interpretation of the symbolic character of the eternal flame in general according to solemn beliefs which had established during the NS-era especially in SS circles: in the fire they wanted to feel the soul of ancestors. The symbol of the eternal flame stood for the aspiration of the ancestral soul from which man arises at his birth and which he reenters at his death. Consecration-sites and -events suggested the immortality of the people&#x27;s soul. By sacral-architecture and spectacular mass-events the subconsciousness of the masses was influenced by pseudo-religious ideas. The two cult rooms inside the North Tower were built to deepen the own &quot;mission&quot;.
* In 1938, Siegfried Taubert was in charge of developing the castle, when Himmler inquired about the cost of installing a planetarium. To round off the subjects taught at the Wewelsburg SS school a teacher was sought who should draw cross-connections between astronomy and history and the folklife of the ancestors so that the historical and ideological schooling was to be enhanced and deepened by the &quot;cosmic view&quot; (kosmische Schau).
* According to the writer J. von Helsing, the recovered unknown flying object that crashed in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) near Freiburg in 1936 was taken to the Wewelsburg castle, where a reverse engineering project was launched, reportedly leading to the construction of several very advanced flying machines towards the end of the World War II. This subject is often featured in popular culture and science fiction; The History Channel series &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; features the Freiburg disc crash in their episode &quot;Alien and the Third Reich&quot; (Season 2, episode 5).

=== Niederhagen Camp ===

Just offsite of Wewelsburg was the smallest German KZ, Niederhagen prison and labour camp. Begun on June 17, 1940, the camp was completed the following year and named after Niederhagen Forest, the name Himmler had given to the forest outside the castle several years earlier.

It began with 480 prisoners from Sachsenhausen, and grew to 1,200, consisting chiefly of Soviet POWs and captured foreign labourers shipped to Germany, although early in its life it was also a gathering point for Jehovah&#x27;s Witness prisoners. Correspondingly, a large percentage of the concentration camp inmates at Niederhagen who were working on the Wewelsburg Castle were indeed Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, perhaps the only place where they constituted the core KZ population. During the SS&#x27;s December 1942 Korherr Report, it was reported to have only housed 12 Jews, all of whom had died.

Of the 3,900 prisoners held during the camp&#x27;s existence, 1,285 died of typhus and 56 were formally executed. In August 1942, the Allies began deciphering death tolls transmitted from the camps; Niederhagen had reported 21 deaths for that month. The camp was dissolved in 1943 with most of the prisoners resettled in Buchenwald, though several dozen prisoners remained behind, housed directly in Wewelsburg.

SS-Hauptsturmführer Adolf Haas, who had overseen the camp from its beginning, was transferred to a command position at Bergen-Belsen, while &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; Wolfgang Plaul was transferred to Buchenwald. SS-&quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Hermann Michl had last been recorded at the camp in 1942, and later appeared at the Riga ghetto.

== Postwar ==
In 1948/49, the castle was restored. On 29 June 1950, the castle was reopened as a museum and youth hostel, while the Niederhagen kitchen had been renovated into a village fire station.

In 1973, a two-year project was begun to restore the North Tower. Due to a local government reform the Wewelsburg became property of the district of Paderborn in 1975.

By 1977, it had been decided to restore the entire site as a war monument. It opened on 20 March 1982 under the name &quot;Wewelsburg 1933-1945: Kult- und Terrorstätte der SS&quot; in the former SS guard house in the castle forecourt. Several Niederhagen camp survivors were present.

In 1996, the Historical Museum of the Bishopric of Paderborn (&quot;Historisches Museum des Hochstifts Paderborn&quot;) opened in the east- and south-wings. The museum documents the history of the &quot;Hochstift Paderborn&quot; (Bishopric of Paderborn) which was one of territories of the Holy Roman Empire. In 2010, the museum&#x27;s contemporary history department was reopened as &quot;Wewelsburg 1933–1945 Memorial Museum&quot;. The new permanent exhibition &quot;Ideology and terror of the SS&quot; now presents the history of the Schutzstaffel&#x27;s activities in Wewelsburg within the broader context of the SS as a whole.

In 2000, a memorial was built in honour of the deceased Niederhagen prisoners; four years later, the Kreismuseum Wewelsburg was granted DM 29,400 for restoring and moving the remnants of the Niederhagen camp, as well as producing an educational film on the Ukrainian and Russian prisoners who were housed there. In 2006 and 2007, it hosted the annual Internacia Seminario, a meeting of Esperanto youth.

The Youth hostel Wewelsburg, with 218 beds, is located in the west wing of the castle. The &quot;Historical Museum of the Prince Bishopric of Paderborn&quot; is located in the south and east wings.

In 2010, a museum about the Nazi use of the castle opened. A news item stated that the exhibition &quot;dubbed the world&#x27;s first dedicated entirely to the dreaded Schutzstaffel, charts its growth from Hitler&#x27;s elite guard to a band of a million men who committed unspeakable crimes across Europe. A discussion of tours of the castle on the Expedia web site in 2020 included this information: &quot;...head to the former guardhouse in the forecourt for the Wewelsburg 1933-1945 Memorial Museum. Browse the free and fascinating exhibit &quot;Ideology and Terror of the SS&quot;&quot;. A fee applied to tour the castle, however. The Kreismuseum Wewelsburg web site stated that the exhibition &quot;utilises a comprehensive media concept as well as classical image and text elements. Many qualitative, original exhibits such as Heinrich Himmler’s pocket calendar, concentration camp barrack walls and prisoners’ clothing are on display&quot;.

<doc id="315043" wikidata="Q422248" url="?curid=315043" title="Monoclonal antibody">
<text>A monoclonal antibody (mAb, more rarely called moAb) is an antibody produced from a cell lineage made by cloning a unique white blood cell. All subsequent antibodies derived this way trace back to a unique parent cell.

Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, binding only to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody). In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different antibody-secreting plasma cell lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one monoclonal antibody to two epitopes.

It is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to almost any suitable substance; they can then serve to detect or purify it. This capability has become an investigative tool in biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. Monoclonal antibodies are used in the diagnosis of illnesses such as cancer and infections and are used therapeutically in the treatment of e.g. cancer and inflammatory diseases.
== History ==
In the early 1900s, immunologist Paul Ehrlich proposed the idea of a &quot;Zauberkugel&quot; – &quot;magic bullet&quot;, conceived of as a compound which selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, and could deliver a toxin for that organism. This underpinned the concept of monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal drug conjugates. Ehrlich and Élie Metchnikoff received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for providing the theoretical basis for immunology.

By the 1970s, lymphocytes producing a single antibody were known, in the form of multiple myeloma – a cancer affecting B-cells. These abnormal antibodies or paraproteins were used to study the structure of antibodies, but it was not yet possible to produce identical antibodies specific to a given antigen. In 1973, Jerrold Schwaber described the production of monoclonal antibodies using human–mouse hybrid cells. This work remains widely cited among those using human-derived hybridomas. In 1975, Georges Köhler and César Milstein succeeded in making fusions of myeloma cell lines with B cells to create hybridomas that could produce antibodies, specific to known antigens and that were immortalized. They and Niels Kaj Jerne shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 for the discovery.

In 1988, Gregory Winter and his team pioneered the techniques to humanize monoclonal antibodies, eliminating the reactions that many monoclonal antibodies caused in some patients. By the 1990s research was making progress in using monoclonal antibodies therapeutically, and in 2018, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation, using monoclonal antibodies that prevent inhibitory linkages.

The translational work needed to implement these ideas is credited to Lee Nadler. As explained in an NIH article, &quot;He was the first to discover monoclonal antibodies directed against human B-cell–specific antigens and, in fact, all the known human B-cell–specific antigens were discovered in his laboratory. He is a true translational investigator, since he used these monoclonal antibodies to classify human B-cell leukemia and lymphomas as well as to create therapeutic agents for patients. . . More importantly, he was the first in the world to administer a monoclonal antibody to a human (a patient with B-cell lymphoma).&quot;

==Production==

===Hybridoma development===
Much of the work behind production of monoclonal antibodies is rooted in the production of hybridomas, which involves identifying antigen-specific plasma/plasmablast cells that produce antibodies specific to an antigen of interest and fusing these cells with myeloma cells. Rabbit B-cells can be used to form a rabbit hybridoma. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. This is possible because myeloma cells have lost the ability to synthesize hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme necessary for the salvage synthesis of nucleic acids. The absence of HGPRT is not a problem for these cells unless the de novo purine synthesis pathway is also disrupted. Exposing cells to aminopterin (a folic acid analogue which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase) makes them unable to use the de novo pathway and become fully auxotrophic for nucleic acids, thus requiring supplementation to survive.

The selective culture medium is called HAT medium because it contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. This medium is selective for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the medium because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).

This mixture of cells is then diluted and clones are grown from single parent cells on microtitre wells. The antibodies secreted by the different clones are then assayed for their ability to bind to the antigen (with a test such as ELISA or antigen microarray assay) or immuno-dot blot. The most productive and stable clone is then selected for future use.

The hybridomas can be grown indefinitely in a suitable cell culture medium. They can also be injected into mice (in the peritoneal cavity, surrounding the gut). There, they produce tumors secreting an antibody-rich fluid called ascites fluid.

The medium must be enriched during &quot;in vitro&quot; selection to further favour hybridoma growth. This can be achieved by the use of a layer of feeder fibrocyte cells or supplement medium such as briclone. Culture-media conditioned by macrophages can be used. Production in cell culture is usually preferred as the ascites technique is painful to the animal. Where alternate techniques exist, ascites is considered unethical.

=== Novel mAb development technology ===
Several monoclonal antibody technologies have been developed recently, such as phage display, single B cell culture, single cell amplification from various B cell populations and single plasma cell interrogation technologies. Different from traditional hybridoma technology, the newer technologies use molecular biology techniques to amplify the heavy and light chains of the antibody genes by PCR and produce in either bacterial or mammalian systems with recombinant technology. One of the advantages of the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals in the laboratory.

===Purification===
After obtaining either a media sample of cultured hybridomas or a sample of ascites fluid, the desired antibodies must be extracted. Cell culture sample contaminants consist primarily of media components such as growth factors, hormones and transferrins. In contrast, the &quot;in vivo&quot; sample is likely to have host antibodies, proteases, nucleases, nucleic acids and viruses. In both cases, other secretions by the hybridomas such as cytokines may be present. There may also be bacterial contamination and, as a result, endotoxins that are secreted by the bacteria. Depending on the complexity of the media required in cell culture and thus the contaminants, one or the other method (&quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot;) may be preferable.

The sample is first conditioned, or prepared for purification. Cells, cell debris, lipids, and clotted material are first removed, typically by centrifugation followed by filtration with a 0.45 μm filter. These large particles can cause a phenomenon called membrane fouling in later purification steps. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially in cases where the desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. The sample is therefore concentrated by ultrafiltration or dialysis.

Most of the charged impurities are usually anions such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Either cation exchange chromatography is used at a low enough pH that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or anion exchange chromatography is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their isoelectric point (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) is defined as the pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH &gt; pI, a protein has a net negative charge, and when the pH &lt; pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, albumin has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.

Transferrin can instead be removed by size exclusion chromatography. This method is one of the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low elution times.

A much quicker, single-step method of separation is protein A/G affinity chromatography. The antibody selectively binds to protein A/G, so a high level of purity (generally &gt;80%) is obtained. The generally harsh conditions of this method may damage easily damaged antibodies. A low pH can break the bonds to remove the antibody from the column. In addition to possibly affecting the product, low pH can cause protein A/G itself to leak off the column and appear in the eluted sample. Gentle elution buffer systems that employ high salt concentrations are available to avoid exposing sensitive antibodies to low pH. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin.

To achieve maximum purity in a single step, affinity purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an agarose support. If the antigen is a peptide, it is commonly synthesized with a terminal cysteine, which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as KLH during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing medium is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt elution buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.

===Antibody heterogeneity===
Product heterogeneity is common in monoclonal antibodies and other recombinant biological products and is typically introduced either upstream during expression or downstream during manufacturing.

These variants are typically aggregates, deamidation products, glycosylation variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, as well as amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions. These seemingly minute structural changes can affect preclinical stability and process optimization as well as therapeutic product potency, bioavailability and immunogenicity. The generally accepted purification method of process streams for monoclonal antibodies includes capture of the product target with protein A, elution, acidification to inactivate potential mammalian viruses, followed by ion chromatography, first with anion beads and then with cation beads.

Displacement chromatography has been used to identify and characterize these often unseen variants in quantities that are suitable for subsequent preclinical evaluation regimens such as animal pharmacokinetic studies. Knowledge gained during the preclinical development phase is critical for enhanced product quality understanding and provides a basis for risk management and increased regulatory flexibility. The recent Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s Quality by Design initiative attempts to provide guidance on development and to facilitate design of products and processes that maximizes efficacy and safety profile while enhancing product manufacturability.

===Recombinant===
The production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies involves repertoire cloning, CRISPR/Cas9, or phage display/yeast display technologies. Recombinant antibody engineering involves antibody production by the use of viruses or yeast, rather than mice. These techniques rely on rapid cloning of immunoglobulin gene segments to create libraries of antibodies with slightly different amino acid sequences from which antibodies with desired specificities can be selected. The phage antibody libraries are a variant of phage antigen libraries. These techniques can be used to enhance the specificity with which antibodies recognize antigens, their stability in various environmental conditions, their therapeutic efficacy and their detectability in diagnostic applications. Fermentation chambers have been used for large scale antibody production.

=== Chimeric antibodies ===
While mouse and human antibodies are structurally similar, the differences between them were sufficient to invoke an immune response when murine monoclonal antibodies were injected into humans, resulting in their rapid removal from the blood, as well as systemic inflammatory effects and the production of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).

Recombinant DNA has been explored since the late 1980s to increase residence times. In one approach called &quot;CDR grafting&quot;, mouse DNA encoding the binding portion of a monoclonal antibody was merged with human antibody-producing DNA in living cells. The expression of this &quot;chimeric&quot; or &quot;humanised&quot; DNA through cell culture yielded part-mouse, part-human antibodies.

=== Human antibodies ===
Ever since the discovery that monoclonal antibodies could be generated, scientists have targeted the creation of &quot;fully&quot; human products to reduce the side effects of humanised or chimeric antibodies. Several successful approaches have been proposed: transgenic mice, phage display and single B cell cloning.

== Cost ==
Monoclonal antibodies are more expensive to manufacture than small molecules due to the complex processes involved and the general size of the molecules, all in addition to the enormous research and development costs involved in bringing a new chemical entity to patients. They are priced to enable manufacturers to recoup the typically large investment costs, and where there are no price controls, such as the United States, prices can be higher if they provide great value. Seven University of Pittsburgh researchers concluded, &quot;The annual price of mAb therapies is about $100,000 higher in oncology and hematology than in other disease states&quot;, comparing them on a per patient basis, to those for cardiovascular or metabolic disorders, immunology, infectious diseases, allergy, and ophthalmology.

== Applications ==

===Diagnostic tests===

Once monoclonal antibodies for a given substance have been produced, they can be used to detect the presence of this substance. Proteins can be detected using the Western blot and immuno dot blot tests. In immunohistochemistry, monoclonal antibodies can be used to detect antigens in fixed tissue sections, and similarly, immunofluorescence can be used to detect a substance in either frozen tissue section or live cells.

===Analytic and chemical uses===

Antibodies can also be used to purify their target compounds from mixtures, using the method of immunoprecipitation.

===Therapeutic uses===
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies act through multiple mechanisms, such as blocking of targeted molecule functions, inducing apoptosis in cells which express the target, or by modulating signalling pathways.

==== Cancer treatment ====
One possible treatment for cancer involves monoclonal antibodies that bind only to cancer-cell-specific antigens and induce an immune response against the target cancer cell. Such mAbs can be modified for delivery of a toxin, radioisotope, cytokine or other active conjugate or to design bispecific antibodies that can bind with their Fab regions both to target antigen and to a conjugate or effector cell. Every intact antibody can bind to cell receptors or other proteins with its Fc region.
 MAbs approved by the FDA for cancer include:

* Alemtuzumab
* Bevacizumab
* Cetuximab
* Dostarlimab
* Gemtuzumab ozogamicin
* Ipilimumab
* Nivolumab
* Ofatumumab
* Panitumumab
* Pembrolizumab
* Ranibizumab
* Rituximab
* Trastuzumab
====Autoimmune diseases====
Monoclonal antibodies used for autoimmune diseases include infliximab and adalimumab, which are effective in rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis and ankylosing spondylitis by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α. Basiliximab and daclizumab inhibit IL-2 on activated T cells and thereby help prevent acute rejection of kidney transplants. Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in treating moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.

====Examples of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies====

Monoclonal antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine like CiteAb. Below are examples of clinically important monoclonal antibodies.
=== COVID-19 ===
In 2020, the monoclonal antibody therapies bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab were given emergency use authorizations by the US Food and Drug Administration to reduce the number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and deaths because of COVID-19. In September 2021, the Biden administration purchased billion worth of Regeneron monoclonal antibodies at $2,100 per dose to curb the shortage.

As of December 2021, &quot;in vitro&quot; neutralization tests indicate monoclonal antibody therapies (with the exception of sotrovimab and tixagevimab/cilgavimab) were not likely to be active against the Omicron variant.

Over 2021–22, two Cochrane reviews found insufficient evidence for using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19 infections. The reviews applied only to people who were unvaccinated against COVID‐19, and only to the COVID-19 variants existing during the studies, not to newer variants, such as Omicron.

In March 2024, pemivibart, a monoclonal antibody drug, received an emergency use authorization from the US FDA for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis to protect certain moderately to severely immunocompromised individuals against COVID-19.

<text>Karl Maria Wiligut (alias Weisthor, Jarl Widar, Lobesam; 10 December 1866 – 3 January 1946) was an Austrian Völkisch occultist and soldier. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I and was a leading figure in the Irminism movement, eventually joining the SS after being recruited by Heinrich Himmler.

== Early life and career ==
Karl Maria Wiligut was born in Vienna on December 10, 1866, into a Catholic military family. Both his father and grandfather had served in the military and at the age of 14, he was enrolled in Breitensee Imperial Cadet Academy After graduating, he was conscripted to the k.u.k. infantry regiment of Milan I King of Serbia. On 17 December 1883 he was appointed to infantry, four days later he became a Gefreiter (private). In 1888, he was promoted to lieutenant.

Karl showed interest in the Völkisch movement early on in his life. In 1889, he joined the quasi-masonic &quot;Schlaraffia-Loge&quot; and in 1903, he published his first book, &quot;Seyfrieds Runen&quot;, a collection of poems and stories concerning ancient Germanic runes. 1908, he published his second book &quot;Neun Gebote Gôts&quot;, on the subject Irminism. Wiligut claimed to be the descendant of an ancient line of god-kings dating back to 228,000 B.C. and that he was able to see into the past lives of his ancestors.

During World War I, Wiligut served on both the Italian and Eastern front. He served with 30th Infantry Regiment in the Carpathian Mountains before commanding a training unit near Salzburg in Austria-Hungary. He was decorated for gallantry and on 1 August 1917, he was promoted to colonel. In May 1918, he was retired from the front and commanded a convalescence camp near Lviv. After almost 40 years in military service, he retired on 1 January 1919 with an impeccable record, and moved to Morzg near Salzburg where he dedicated his time to occult studies. He renewed his acquaintance with Theodor Czepl of the Ordo Novi Templi, who in winter 1920-21 spent seven weeks in Wiligut&#x27;s house. Czepl compiled a report for the archive of the O.N.T., where he describes Wiligut as &quot;a man martial in aspect, who revealed himself as bearer of a secret line of German kingship&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1906, he married Malwine Leurs von Treuenringen of Bozen, with whom he had two daughters, Gertrud and Lotte. A twin brother of one of the girls died as an infant, a devastating tragedy for Wiligut, who was desperate for a male heir to which he could pass on his &quot;secret knowledge&quot;, which estranged him from his wife.

Wiligut&#x27;s wife remained unimpressed by her husband&#x27;s claim to kingship; blaming him for their destitution, she pushed for his committal to a mental hospital. On 29 November 1924, while he was at a cafe with friends, police arrested Wiligut and he was sent to the local mental institution, where he was confined for several years.

Wiligut&#x27;s medical records reflect violence at home, including threats to kill his wife, grandiose projects, eccentric behavior and occult interests. Following this arrest in 1924, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and megalomania. He was declared legally incompetent by a Salzburg court and committed to a Salzburg asylum, where he remained until 1927. In 1932, he abandoned his wife and family, and emigrated from Austria to Germany, residing in Munich. He is known to have corresponded with many admirers and disciples, including Ernst Rüdiger and members of the Order of the New Templars.

== Involvement in Himmler&#x27;s personal staff ==

Wiligut made a name for himself in occult circles in Germany, eventually getting the attention of the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. Shortly after being introduced to Himmler in September 1933 at a conference of the &quot;Nordische Gesellschaft&quot;, Wiligut was inducted into the SS (under the pseudonym &quot;Karl Maria Weisthor&quot;) to head a Department for Pre- and Early History which was created for him within the SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA). In April 1934 he was promoted to the SS equivalent of his old colonel rank (Standartenführer), and then made head of Section VIII (Archives) for RuSHA in October 1934. In November 1934 a promotion followed to the rank of Oberführer (lieutenant-brigadier), and then in the spring of 1935 Wiligut was transferred to Berlin to serve on Himmler&#x27;s personal staff. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadeführer (major-general) in September 1936.

In Berlin, where he worked in the office of Karl Wolff, chief adjutant of the SS, Wiligut developed his plans for the rebuilding of the Wewelsburg into an allegorical &quot;center of the world&quot;. Wiligut&#x27;s friend Manfred von Knobelsdorff attempted to practise Wiligut&#x27;s Irminism on the Wewelsburg. An Irministic &#x27;baptism&#x27; of Karl Wolff&#x27;s eldest son Thorisman was performed by Wiligut on 4 January 1937, attended by SS dignitaries Reinhard Heydrich and Karl Diebitsch.

In summer 1936, Gunther Kirchhoff and Wiligut, undertook a private 22-day expedition to the Murg Valley near Baden-Baden in the Black Forest, where there was a settlement described as consisting of &quot;old half-timbered houses, architectural ornament, crosses, inscriptions, and natural and man-made rock formations in the forest,&quot; which, they claimed, showed it to be an ancient Krist settlement (Krist was a messianic Germanic figure allegedly associated with Irminism). Wiligut identified Schloss Eberstein as a center of Irminism. In Saxony, he discovered another &quot;Irminist complex&quot;, identifying as &quot;spirit point&quot;, Bodenburg as &quot;will point&quot;, Gandersheim as &quot;central awareness point&quot;, as &quot;force hand point&quot;, Kalefeld as &quot;heart point&quot; of the crucified Balder, as &quot;generative point&quot;, Naensen as &quot;material hand point&quot; and Ebergötzen as &quot;skould point&quot;.
Wiligut contributed significantly to the development of Wewelsburg as the order-castle and ceremonial center of SS pseudo-religious practice. He designed the Totenkopfring, which Himmler personally awarded to prestigious SS officers.

In November 1938, Karl Wolff, chief adjutant of Himmler&#x27;s personal staff and the second-highest-ranking officer in the SS, visited Wiligut&#x27;s wife and learned of Wiligut&#x27;s earlier involuntary commitment to a mental institution, which proved embarrassing to Himmler.

Wiligut&#x27;s staff was notified that his &quot;application&quot; for retirement on grounds of age and poor health had been granted in February 1939, and the official retirement was dated 28 August 1939, only a few days prior to the outbreak of World War II.

==Death==
Wiligut&#x27;s final years were insecure: he moved to Aufkirchen in 1939, to Goslar in 1940, and to Wörthersee in 1943, and after the war to a refugee camp in St. Johann near Velden, where he had a stroke. After this he was permitted to return to Salzburg, but he soon moved on to Arolsen in Hesse, where he died on 3 January 1946. His gravestone is inscribed with &quot;UNSER LEBEN GEHT DAHIN WIE EIN GESCHWÄTZ&quot; (&quot;Our Life Passes Away Like Idle Chatter&quot;).

== Occult involvement ==
In 1889, Wiligut joined the Schlaraffia, a quasi-masonic lodge. When he left the lodge in 1909, he held the rank of knight and the office of chancellor. His first book, &quot;Seyfrieds Runen&quot;, was a collection of poems about the Rabenstein at Znaim on the Austrian-Moravian border; it was published in 1903 under his full real, name and an added moniker, &quot;Lobesam.&quot; His next book, &quot;Neun Gebote Gots,&quot; followed in 1908, in which Wiligut first claimed to be the heir to the ancient tradition of Irminism. Both List and Wiligut were influenced by Friedrich Fischbach&#x27;s 1900 &quot;Die Buchstaben Gutenbergs&quot;. From 1908, Wiligut was in contact with the occult group Ordo Novi Templi in Vienna.

Wiligut claimed to be in the tradition of a long line of Germanic mystic teachers, reaching back into prehistoric times. He also claimed to have spiritual powers that allowed him direct access to genetic memories of his ancestors thousands of years in the past.

Wiligut was influenced by the &quot;Aryo-Christian&quot; ideas of Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, which proclaimed a European origin of Christianity. Wiligut claimed that the Bible had originally been written in a Germanic language, and testified to an &quot;Irminic&quot; religion – &quot;Irminenreligion&quot; or Irminism – that contrasted with Guido von List&#x27;s Wotanism. Wiligut identified Irminism as the true German ancestral religion, claiming that List&#x27;s Wotanism and Armanen runes was a schismatic false religion. He claimed to worship a Germanic god &quot;Krist&quot;, whom Christianity was supposed later to have appropriated as their own savior Christ.

According to Wiligut, Germanic culture and history reached back to 228,000 BC. He proposed that at this time, there were three suns, and Earth was inhabited by giants, dwarfs and other mythical creatures. Wiligut claimed that his ancestors, the Adler-Wiligoten, ended a long period of war. By 12,500 BC, the Irminic religion of Krist was revealed and from that time became the religion of all Germanic peoples, until the schismatic adherents of Wotanism gained the upper hand. In 1200 BC, the Wotanists succeeded in destroying the Irminic religious center at Goslar, following which the Irminists erected a new temple at the &quot;Externsteine&quot;, which was in turn appropriated by the Wotanists in AD 460. Wiligut&#x27;s own ancestors were supposedly protagonists in this setting: the Wiligotis were &quot;Ueiskunings&quot; (&quot;Ice kings&quot;) descending from a union of Aesir and Vanir. They founded the city of Vilna as the center of their Germanic empire and always remained true to their Irminic faith.

Wiligut&#x27;s convictions assumed a paranoid trait in the 1920s as he became convinced that his family was the victim of a continuing persecution of Irminists, at present conducted by the Roman Catholic Church, the Jews, and the Freemasons, on which groups he also blamed the defeat of World War I and the downfall of the Habsburg Empire.

During the 1920s, Wiligut wrote down 38 verses (out of a number purportedly exceeding 1,000), the so-called &quot;Halgarita Sprüche&quot;, that he claimed to have memorized as a child, taught by his father. Wiligut had designed his own &quot;runic alphabet&quot; for this purpose.

Werner von Bülow and Emil Rüdiger of the &quot;Edda-Gesellschaft&quot; (Edda Society) translated and annotated these verses. They claimed that numbers 27 and 1818 are connected with the Black Sun. Verse number 27 according to Willigut is a 20,000-year-old &quot;solar blessing&quot;:
:&quot;Sunur saga santur toe Syntir peri fuir sprueh Wilugoti haga tharn Halga fuir santur toe&quot;

Werner von Bülow translates this as follows:
Legend tells, that two Suns, two wholesome in change-rule UR and SUN, alike to the hourglass which turned upside down ever gives one of these the victory / The meaning of the divine errant wandering way / dross star in fire&#x27;s sphere became in fire-tongue revealed to the Earth-I-course of the race of Paradise / godwilling leaders lead to the weal through their care in universal course, what is visible and soon hidden, whence they led the imagination of mankind / polar in change-play, from UR to SUN in sacrificial service of waxing and waning, in holy fire Santur is ambiguously spent in sparks, but turns victorious to blessing.

&quot;Santur&quot; is interpreted as a burnt-out sun that was still visible at the time of Homer. Rüdiger speculates that this was the center of the solar system hundreds of millennia ago, and he imagines a fight between the new and the old Suns that was decided 330,000 years ago. &quot;Santur&quot; is seen as the source of power of the Hyperboreans.

In esoteric currents of Neo-Nazism, Neofolk, National Socialist black metal and Neopaganism, Wiligut&#x27;s writings enjoyed renewed interest in the 1990s.

==Runes==
In 1934, Wiligut developed a rune row loosely based on the Armanen runes of Guido von List even though Wiligut rejected List&#x27;s runes and his overall philosophy.

Wiligut claimed to have been initiated into &quot;runic lore&quot; by his grandfather Karl Wiligut (1794–1883).
His rune row has 24 letters, like the Elder Futhark. Like von List&#x27;s Armanen runes that are closely based on the Younger Futhark, many of Wiligut&#x27;s runes are identical to historical runes, with some additions. The historical Futhark sequence is not preserved.

Wiligut&#x27;s names for his runes are: Tel, Man, Kaun, Fa, Asa, Os, Eis, Not, Tor, Tyr, Laf, Rit, Thorn, Ur, Sig, Zil, Yr, Hag-Al, H, Wendehorn, Gibor, Eh, Othil, Bar-Bjork.

Runes without precedent in the historical runes are Tel (a crossed ring, similar to the sun cross symbol), Tor (like a Latin T), Zil (like a rotated Latin Z), Gibor (taken from von List&#x27;s runes). The shape of Wendehorn is similar to Tvimadur.

<doc id="315050" wikidata="Q246181" url="?curid=315050" title="Cytotoxicity">
<text>Cytotoxicity is the quality of being toxic to cells. Examples of toxic agents are toxic metals, toxic chemicals, microbe neurotoxins, radiation particles and even specific neurotransmitters when the system is out of balance. Also some types of drugs, e.g alcohol, and some venom, e.g. from the puff adder (&quot;Bitis arietans&quot;) or brown recluse spider (&quot;Loxosceles reclusa&quot;) are toxic to cells.

==Cell physiology==
Treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of prognoses. The cells may undergo necrosis, in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of cell lysis. The cells can stop actively growing and dividing (a decrease in cell viability), or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death (apoptosis).

Cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling, lose membrane integrity, shut down metabolism, and release their contents into the environment. Cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers. Apoptosis is characterized by well defined cytological and molecular events including a change in the refractive index of the cell, cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation and cleavage of DNA into regularly sized fragments. Cells in culture that are undergoing apoptosis eventually undergo secondary necrosis. They will shut down metabolism, lose membrane integrity and lyse.

==Measurement==
Cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries. Researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds, if they are interested in developing a therapeutic that targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, for instance; or they can screen &quot;hits&quot; from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.

Assessing cell membrane integrity is one of the most common ways to measure cell viability and cytotoxic effects. Compounds that have cytotoxic effects often compromise cell membrane integrity. Vital dyes, such as trypan blue or propidium iodide are normally excluded from the inside of healthy cells; however, if the cell membrane has been compromised, they freely cross the membrane and stain intracellular components. Alternatively, membrane integrity can be assessed by monitoring the passage of substances that are normally sequestered inside cells to the outside. One molecule, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is commonly measured using LDH assay. LDH reduces NAD to NADH which elicits a colour change by interaction with a specific probe. Protease biomarkers have been identified that allow researchers to measure relative numbers of live and dead cells within the same cell population. The live-cell protease is only active in cells that have a healthy cell membrane, and loses activity once the cell is compromised and the protease is exposed to the external environment. The dead-cell protease cannot cross the cell membrane, and can only be measured in culture media after cells have lost their membrane integrity.

Cytotoxicity can also be monitored using 3-(4, 5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) or with 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), which yields a water-soluble product, or the MTS assay. This assay measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Viable cells will reduce the MTS reagent to a colored formazan product. A similar redox-based assay has also been developed using the fluorescent dye, resazurin. In addition to using dyes to indicate the redox potential of cells in order to monitor their viability, researchers have developed assays that use ATP content as a marker of viability. Such ATP-based assays include bioluminescent assays in which ATP is the limiting reagent for the luciferase reaction.

Cytotoxicity can also be measured by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, WST assay and clonogenic assay.

Suitable assays can be combined and performed sequentially on the same cells in order to reduce assay-specific false positive or false negative results. A possible combination is LDH-XTT-NR (Neutral red assay)-SRB which is also available in a kit format.

A label-free approach to follow the cytotoxic response of adherent animal cells in real-time is based on electric impedance measurements when the cells are grown on gold-film electrodes. This technology is referred to as electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). Label-free real-time techniques provide the kinetics of the cytotoxic response rather than just a snapshot like many colorimetric endpoint assays.

Material that has been determined as cytotoxic, typically biomedical waste, is often marked with a symbol that consists of a capital letter &quot;C&quot; inside a triangle.

==Prediction==
A highly important topic is the prediction of cytotoxicity of chemical compounds based on previous measurements, i.e. in-silico testing. For this purpose many QSAR and virtual screening methods have been suggested. An independent comparison of these methods has been done within the &quot;Toxicology in the 21st century&quot; project.

==Cancers==
Some chemotherapies contain cytotoxic drugs, whose purpose is interfering with the cell division. These drugs cannot distinguish between normal and malignant cells, but they inhibit the overall process of cell division with the purpose to kill the cancers before the hosts.

==Immune system==
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) describes the cell-killing ability of certain lymphocytes, which requires the target cell being marked by an antibody. Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), which is mediated by the complement system.

Three groups of cytotoxic lymphocytes are distinguished:

* Cytotoxic T cells
* Natural killer cells
* Natural killer T cells

* Host–pathogen interaction
* Membrane vesicle trafficking
* Snake toxins

<text>A newel, also called a central pole or support column, is the central supporting pillar of a staircase. It can also refer to an upright post that supports and/or terminates the handrail of a stair banister (the &quot;newel post&quot;). In stairs having straight flights it is the principal post at the foot of the staircase, but the term can also be used for the intermediate posts on landings and at the top of a staircase. Although its primary purpose is structural, newels have long been adorned with decorative trim and designed in different architectural styles.

Newel posts turned on a lathe are solid pieces that can be highly decorative, and they typically need to be fixed to a square newel base for installation. These are sometimes called solid newels in distinction from hollow newels due to varying techniques of construction. Hollow newels are known more accurately as box newel posts. In historic homes, folklore holds that the house plans were placed in the newel upon completion of the house before the newel was capped.

The most common means of fixing a newel post to the floor is to use a newel post fastener, which secures a newel post to a timber joist through either concrete or wooden flooring.

== In popular culture ==
A loose ball cop finial on the newel post at the base of the stairway is a plot device in the 1946 classic &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;. The same is used in jest in the 1989 film &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot;, in which Clark Griswold, in an emotional meltdown, cuts a loose finial off a newel post with a chainsaw. He casually exclaims, &quot;Fixed the newel post!&quot; and carries on. 

In &quot;Family Guy&quot; Season 17, Episode 16, “You Can’t Handle the Booth”, Stewie and Brian argue over the semantics of Peter getting stuck in what Stewie calls “banister slats” and Brian corrects him by saying they are called “baluster slats”. Stewie then asks if the “baluster” is the big, round thing at the bottom of the stairs where the staircase begins, to which Brian laughs at him and corrects him by saying “I believe what you are referring to is a newel post”.

The comedy duo Nichols and May performed a routine about a frustrating attempt to obtain operator assistance from a trio of unhelpful telephone operators, the first of whom uses a bizarre phonetic alphabet to clarify the spelling of the requested name, where &quot;newel post&quot; represents the letter N: &quot;&#x27;K&#x27; as in &#x27;knife&#x27;; &#x27;A&#x27; as in &#x27;aardvark&#x27;; &#x27;P&#x27; as in &#x27;pneumonia&#x27;; &#x27;L&#x27; as in &#x27;luscious&#x27;; &#x27;A&#x27; as in &#x27;aardvark&#x27; again; &#x27;N&#x27; as in &#x27;newel post&#x27;, Kaplan?&quot;

<doc id="315058" wikidata="Q17177369" url="?curid=315058" title="Temple Drake">
<text>Temple Drake is a fictional character created by William Faulkner. She appears in the novels &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1931) and &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; (1951). The 1962 play &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot; and the films &quot;The Story of Temple Drake&quot; (1933) and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1961) also feature the character. In the two films she is played, respectively, by Miriam Hopkins and Lee Remick.

==Plot==
In the first novel, she is a University of Mississippi student who is kidnapped and raped by Popeye, a criminal. Corrupted by her experience in a house of prostitution, she lies in a court, resulting in an innocent man being lynched for a murder. In the second novel, she plans on leaving her family and going back to a criminal lifestyle until her maid kills her child to return her mind to clarity. In the first film, Temple tells the truth on the witness stand and reveals her sordid past. The second film uses elements of both novels, but in that film she does not attend a court hearing.

==Development==
According to Elisabeth Muhlenfeld of Florida State University, who wrote &quot;Bewildered Witness: Temple Drake in &quot;Sanctuary&quot;,&quot; initially Temple was not the primary character, but this was changed in a revision. E. Pauline Degenfelder of Worcester Public Schools argued that Temple, Popeye, and lawyer Horace Benbow were all main characters even though the work presented itself as mainly being about Temple.

==Characterization==
Degenfelder wrote that the author mainly gave a &quot;flat&quot; characterization to Temple in the novel. The reviewer added that &quot;Faulkner sees woman as the instrument who instigates and perpetuates this pattern of evil&quot; and that the use of Temple was &quot;attacking the chivalric code of the South&quot;.

Degenfelder wrote that her characterization in the first film differs from that of the novel version, and that the film gives her a &quot;dual nature&quot; of a dark and light aspects. Gene D. Phillips of Loyola University of Chicago wrote that she is &quot;better&quot; morally than the novel character. Miriam Hopkins stated : &quot;That Temple Drake, now, there was a thing. Just give me a nice un-standardized wretch like Temple three times a year! Give me the complex ladies, and I&#x27;ll interpret the daylights out of them.&quot; Allan R. Ellenberger, author of &quot;Miriam Hopkins: Life and Films of a Hollywood Rebel&quot;, stated that of the characters Hopkins played, Temple was a &quot;favorite&quot; of hers.

In &quot;Requirem for a Nun&quot; and the 1960s &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, though Temple is formally known as &quot;Mrs. Gowan Stevens&quot;, she still calls herself by her maiden name. Phillips stated that internally she still perceives herself to be &quot;an irresponsible adolescent&quot; and undeserving of a reputation of being a responsible wife. In regards to the sequel novel Degenfelder stated that the author formed, in Temple, &quot;an essentially different woman from the same base, without sensing any contradiction.&quot; Degenfelder argued that the 1961 film does not have a consistent Temple as it tried but failed to reconcile the two different Temples from the novels, and that the resulting character was &quot;weak&quot;. In addition, while that film was, according to the reviewer, trying to have a dual nature like with the first film, she felt that Temple was &quot;unconvincing&quot; in the &quot;vamp&quot; role.

==Analysis==
Joseph R. Urgo, author of an encyclopedia article on Temple Drake, wrote that the character is an &quot;intersection&quot; of &quot;female agency&quot;, &quot;pornographic representation&quot;, &quot;the social construction of feminity&quot; and other 20th century &quot;major feminist issues&quot;. According to Urgo, audiences in the late 20th century perceived Temple as a &quot;victim of the various social pressures&quot; inflicted on young women while earlier ones blamed her for the sexual assault she undergoes. Muhlenfeld argued that the earlier characterizations of Temple needed re-evaluation. Philip G. Cohen, David Krause, and Karl F. Zender, who wrote an article about Faulkner&#x27;s works for &quot;Sixteen Modern American Authors&quot;, argued that compared to &quot;A Measure of Innocence in &quot;Sanctuary&quot;&quot; by Diane Luce Cox, Muhlenfeld&#x27;s article &quot;persuades more&quot;, and that Muhlenfeld&#x27;s stance on needing a different viewpoint on Temple agrees with that of Urgo; Muhlenfeld counted Urgo, Cleanth Brooks, Philip M. Weinstein, and Judith Bryant Wittenberg as writers who view Temple in a positive light, while she categorized Calvin S. Brown, Robert L. Mason, Sally R. Page, and Olga Vickery as critics who regard the character as &quot;a symbol of moral decay or evil&quot;.

Urgo also argued that Temple&#x27;s actions differ wildly based on varying &quot;social (and antisocial) situations&quot; that the character lacks a unified &quot;integral being&quot;.

<text>A hudna (from the Arabic meaning &quot;calm&quot; or &quot;quiet&quot;) is a truce or armistice. It is sometimes translated as &quot;cease-fire&quot;. In his medieval dictionary of classical Arabic, the &quot;Lisan al-Arab&quot;, Ibn Manzur defined it as:

: &quot;&quot;hadana&quot;: he grew quiet. &quot;hadina&quot;: he quieted (transitive or intransitive). &quot;haadana&quot;: he made peace with. The noun from each of these is &quot;hudna&quot;.&quot;

A famous early &quot;hudna&quot; was the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah between Muhammad and the Quraysh tribe.

==Hudna in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict==

In English, the term is most frequently used in reference to a ceasefire agreement in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, particularly one that would involve organizations such as Hamas. The concept was also proposed to reduce violence in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians by a Queen&#x27;s University Belfast Professor in the period of 1999–2003 as a result of protracted negotiations with the Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and abroad in countries like Lebanon and Syria. Some others claim that Israeli businessman Eyal Erlich in 2001, after seeing a &quot;hudna&quot; being declared in order to calm a feud in Jordan (cf. &quot;Haaretz&quot;, January 2, 2002); introduced the idea, unsuccessfully, that Israel should suggest a mutual &quot;hudna&quot; as a prelude to a more lasting peace.

Despite the Israeli government&#x27;s rejection of the idea, in summer 2003—following many years of negotiation and facilitation from European advisors and diplomats along with pressure from Abu Mazen and Egypt—Hamas and Islamic Jihad unilaterally declared a 45-day ceasefire, or &quot;hudna&quot;. Its proponents commonly argued that such a cease-fire would allow for important violence reduction and act as a confidence-building measure to make further conflict resolution and peace negotiations possible; its opponents commonly argued that it would be a mere tactical maneuver enabling Palestinian groups to re-group and muster their strength in preparation for further attacks on Israelis, or Israel to continue expanding settlements, blockading Palestinian towns, and arresting members of such groups. The &quot;hudna&quot; started on June 29, 2003.

In January 2004, senior Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi offered a 10-year &quot;hudna&quot; in return for complete withdrawal from all territories captured in the Six-Day War, the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and the &quot;right of return&quot; for all Palestinian refugees. Rantissi gave interviews with European reporters and said the &quot;hudna&quot; was limited to ten years and represented a decision by the movement because it was &quot;difficult to liberate all our land at this stage; the hudna would however not signal a recognition of the state of Israel.&quot;

<doc id="315067" wikidata="Q5403424" url="?curid=315067" title="Ethical relationship">
<text>An ethical relationship, in most theories of ethics that employ the term, is a basic and trustworthy relationship that one individual may have with another, that cannot necessarily be characterized in terms of any abstraction other than trust and common protection of each other&#x27;s body. Honesty is very often a major focus.

== Basics ==

Usually studied is the relationship between the mother and child, and second most basic is between sexual partners—the focus of feminism and Queer theory respectively, in which relationships are central. Family role theory extends this to study paternalistic, maternalistic and sibling roles, and postulates that one&#x27;s later relationships are formed largely in order to fill the roles one has grown to find comfortable as part of one&#x27;s family environment—the family of origin thus setting pattern for the family of choice. Another type of ethical relationship is that between the student at an institution and his or her instructor. Because teaching is “leadership based upon moral and ethical principles.” The student is positioned into a role where participation means understanding and resolving multiple issues of ethics, including the actions of his or her professor or instructor.

== Contrasting theories ==

As contrasted to theories of ethics that derive from dispute resolution, or the meta-ethics as defined in Western moral philosophy, ethical traditions emphasizing abstract moral codes expressed in some language with some judgmental hierarchy, ethical relationship theories tend to emphasize human development. Thus they focus on unequal power and such matters as sexual honesty, marital commitment, child-raising, and responsibility to conduct such essential body and care matters as toilet training, weaning, forming attitudes to sexuality and to masturbation. Failures to consider consequences of teachings or examples set in these matters is disastrous, as it leads to failures of the most fundamental relationship any person has: to their own body, shame in it, pride in it, care for it, etc. Care and concern for other&#x27;s bodies follows.

No ethical tradition has failed to prescribe at least some rules for the conduct of such relationships.

Carol Gilligan famously championed the role of relationships as central to moral reasoning, and superior as a basis for understanding human choices than any prior linguistic or meta-ethical concept. This perspective is now commonly called the ethics of care.

Lawrence Kohlberg, famous for work on moral development as a part of human development, eventually joined Gilligan in starting a descriptive ethics of relationship conduct in what they called the &quot;ethical community&quot; or &quot;just community&quot;. This was in effect a community of practice which, at least in Kohlberg&#x27;s conception, had a core epistemic community of those trusted to define and resolve the disputes between members, and to facilitate the growth of moral development, not only in children, but in prisoners and others.

Donald R. C. Reed, whose book &quot;Following Kohlberg: Liberalism and the Practice of Democratic Community&quot; (1998) outlined the extension of these principles to deliberative democracy, claims that &quot;During the four years following publication of Gilligan&#x27;s &quot;In a Different Voice&quot; (1982), Kohlberg and Gilligan both revised their accounts of moral development so that they converged far more than is commonly recognized.&quot; Reed argued for &quot;extending this convergence to include the understanding developed in the just community projects.&quot;

There is also potential for application of these methods to ethical tradition. Kohlberg&#x27;s student Burton Visotzky, for instance, in &quot;The Genesis of Ethics&quot;, 1997, applied the relationship approach to Ethics in the Bible. The book focuses on the choices and interactions of major characters in the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot;. Visotzky exploits much of the Talmudic, midrash and magisterium, demonstrating that these Jewish theological traditions too had often focused on the ethical relationship, not only between Man and God, but between others in one&#x27;s family, tribe or community.

Mohandas Gandhi, Confucius, Menno Simons and Baruch Spinoza are examples of figures in moral philosophy and political philosophy who focused first and foremost on the ethical choices made in the actual framing and encounter of moral interventions. Greens and New Confucians are two examples of modern movements that are derived in part from relational traditions.

<doc id="315071" wikidata="Q56535" url="?curid=315071" title="Quileute">
<text>The Quileute () are a Native American people in western Washington state in the United States, with 808 enrolled citizens in 2018. They are a federally recognized tribe: the &quot;Quileute Tribe of the Quileute Reservation&quot;.

The Quileute people lost their territory after signing the Quinault Treaty in 1855, but regained one square mile after President Cleveland signed an executive order creating the Quileute Indian Reservation. Their reservation is located near the southwest corner of Clallam County, Washington, at the mouth of the Quillayute River on the Pacific coast. They are part of the Coast Salish people (Pacific Northwest Coast) and the Quinault people (Washington State).

The reservation&#x27;s main population center is the community of La Push, Washington. The 2000 census reported an official resident population of 371 people on the reservation, which has a land area of 4.061 km² (1.5678 sq mi, or 1,003.4 acres).

The Quileute language belongs to the Chimakuan family of languages among Northwest Coast indigenous peoples. The Quileute language is an isolate, as the only related indigenous people to the Quileute, the Chimakum, were destroyed by Chief Seattle and the Suquamish people during the 1860s. The Quileute language is one of only six known languages lacking nasal sounds (i.e., &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;).

Like many Northwest Coast nations, in precontact times the Quileute relied on fishing from local rivers and the Pacific Ocean for food. They built plank houses (longhouses) to protect themselves from the harsh, wet winters west of the Cascade Mountains.

== Government == 
The Quileute tribe is governed by a democratically elected tribal council, who served in staggered, three-year terms. The tribe&#x27;s current administration is:
* Chairman: Douglas Woodruff Jr.
* Elder Vice-Chairman: Tony Foster
* Secretary: Skyler Foster
* Treasurer: Rio Jaime
* Member at Large: James Salazar

The General Manager is responsible for coordinating with the Tribal Programs, providing guidance and direction to the Business Enterprises, and direct supervision over the Administrative Staff.
* General Manager: Bryan Cramer

== Artwork and material culture ==

Historically the Quileute were talented builders and craftsmen. Like many other tribes in the region, they were boat and canoe makers. They could make canoes for whaling, which could hold tons of cargo and many men. They had cedar canoes ranging in size from small boats that could hold two people to giant vessels up to long and capable of holding up to 6,000 pounds. The modern clipper ship&#x27;s hull uses a design much like the canoes used by the Quileutes. 

The Quileutes used the resources from the land to make tools and other items. In the region, almost everything was made out of wood. Necessities like utensils, clothing, weapons, and paints were made from the available natural resources. In terms of arts and crafts, the Quileute Tribe is best known for their woven baskets and dog-hair blankets. The tribe would raise specially bred, woolly dogs for their hair, which they would spin and weave into blankets. They would also weave incredibly fine baskets that were so tightly woven that they could hold water. They could boil water in some of them. 

Using cedar bark, they made waterproof skirts and hats to shield their bodies against the heavy rainfall in the region.

== Ethnobotany ==
The Quileute have extensive knowledge of the medicinal qualities of their homelands&#x27; flora. They use velvetleaf huckleberries, &quot;Vaccinium myrtilloides&quot;, by eating the uncooked berries, stewing the berries to make a sauce, and canning the berries and using them as food.

== Religion and cosmology ==
The Quileute&#x27;s belief system holds that every person had an individual guardian. They would pray to the guardian, along with the sun and Tsikáti (the universe). Much of their original religion was lost after the disruption of European encounter, diseases, losses and colonization. James Island, an island visible from First Beach, has played a role in all aspects of Quileute beliefs and culture. Originally called &quot;A-Ka-Lat&quot; (&quot;Top of the Rock&quot;), it was used as a fortress to keep opposing tribes out and served as a burial ground for chiefs.

As told much in their folklore, the Quileute descended from wolves. Quileute myths proclaim that the two-sided mythical character known as &quot;Dokibatt&quot; and &quot;K’wa’iti&quot; was responsible for creating the first human of the Quileute tribe by transforming a wolf. In the beginning there were five tribal societies that represented the elk hunter, the whale hunter, the fisherman, the weather predictor, and the medicine man. The medicine man honored the creator with the wolf dance. Quileute folklore is still very much alive in the area of the Quileute Nation near La Push.

==Language==

The Quileute tribe speaks a language called Quileute or Quillayute, which is part of the Chimakuan family of languages. The Chimakum, who also spoke a Chimakuan language (called Chemakum, Chimakum, or Chimacum,) were the only other group of people to speak a language from this language family.

In 1999, the last native speaker of the Quileute language died, meaning the language is considered extinct, although three or four users in their 50s retain some knowledge of vocabulary. Up until then, it was spoken only by tribal elders at La Push, and some of the Makah.

Quileute is one of the 13 known languages that are recorded to have no nasal consonants. The tribe is now trying to prevent the loss of the language by teaching it in the Quileute Tribal School, using books written for the students by the tribal elders.

The Quileute Nation Culture and Language Committee released a language and culture app in 2021 in an effort to preserve the language and culture of their people. Efforts to introduce Quileute phrases into everyday life was started in 2007 through the Quileute Revitalization Project, by providing tribe members with accessible information on basic vocabulary words and phrases. The Quileute Nation has continued this project through downloadable alphabet sheets and providing audiobooks read in Quileute.

== Colonization ==
The Quileute relationship with Europeans and Euro-Americans began with encounters between the Quileute and the crews of European ships. Quileute tradition suggests that the earliest encounter was with Spanish sailors who shipwrecked somewhere north of La Push. Another potential early encounter was with the crew of the Spanish schooner &quot;Sonora&quot;, captained by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra in 1775. The &quot;Sonora&quot; encountered several Indians in the waters near the mouth of the Quinault River. After some trading, the encounter culminated in bloodshed with several Indians killed, and six Spaniards killed or enslaved. While the encounter is generally considered to have been between the Quinault people and the Spanish, some authors believe the encounter may have involved the Quileute. In 1787, a small boat crew from the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot; was killed by Indians near Destruction Island. The &quot;Columbia&quot; traded for furs with the village of La Push in 1792. The Russian schooner &quot;Nikolai&quot; ran aground on a beach north of the Quillayute River in 1808. The crew was killed or enslaved. 

Quileute tradition has many accounts of un-dated shipwrecks. One is of a French side-wheeled paddle steamer. The shipwrecked crew lived at La Push for many years, and called the mouth of the river &quot;La Bouche.&quot; Possibly, this is the source of the village&#x27;s current name: La Push.

The first official negotiations with the United States government occurred in 1855 when Isaac Stevens and the Quileute signed the Treaty of Olympia. They ceded great amounts of land and agreed to resettle on the Quinault Reservation.

ARTICLE 1. The said tribes and bands hereby cede, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their right, title, and interest in and to the lands and country occupied by them…

Article 11 of the Treaty of Olympia was a single sentence:

ARTICLE 11. The said tribes and bands agree to free all slaves now held by them, and not to purchase or acquire others hereafter.

This article took away an integral part of the culture of the Northwest Coastal tribes, the rights to possess slaves. Their culture had been focused on possessions and they had always owned slaves. Later, in 1882, A.W. Smith came to La Push to teach the native children. He made a school and started to change the names of the people from tribal names to ones from the Bible. In 1889, after years of this not being enforced, President Cleveland gave the Quileute tribe the La Push reservation. 252 residents moved there and in 1894, 71 people from the Hoh River got their own reservation. In 1889, a non-native individual who wanted the land at La Push started a fire that burned down all the houses on the reservation, along with many artifacts from the days before the Europeans came.

== Quileute Tribal School ==

The Quileute Tribal School serves K-12 tribal and non-tribal students from La Push, Forks, and the Hoh Reservation. The school has an elected five member school board and a hired superintendent. In 2020-2021 131 students from 14 different tribal heritages were enrolled. The school is currently the focus of the organization &#x27;Move to Higher Ground&#x27; which hopes to relocate the school outside of the current tsunami zone. Ground was broken on July 1, 2020, for a new campus. Classes began in the new campus in fall of 2022. 

==Quileute tribe in fiction==
In Susan Sharpe&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Spirit Quest&quot;, eleven-year-old Aaron Singer spends part of his summer vacation on the Quileute Indian Reservation in Washington. There he becomes friends with Robert, a Quileute boy. At the encouragement of his family, who no longer incorporate many of their traditions into daily life, Robert attends tribal school to learn the Quileute language and culture. At Aaron&#x27;s urging, the boys go together on their version of a &quot;spirit quest&quot;, where Aaron finds and saves a trapped eagle. Though he admires and respects Robert&#x27;s culture, Aaron realizes that he can never be a part of it the way Robert is. Aaron&#x27;s initially romantic view is replaced by deeper understanding.

Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Twilight&quot; series features Jacob Black and other werewolf characters, all fictional members of the Quileute tribe and residents of La Push. It has been heavily criticized for its negative depiction of native people and culture and the incorrect telling of the Quileute stories. The Quileute tribe received no compensation from &quot;Twilight&quot;, despite their name and culture being appropriated. The Burke Museum created a website to combat all the misconceptions and educate fans about the truth of the Quileute tribe.

Historian Daniel Immerwahr posits that the Fremen in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; are based on Herbert&#x27;s interactions with Henry Martin, or Han-daa-sho, a fisherman who lived on the Quileute reservation in La Push, Washington.

<text>The Compson family is a fictional family created by American author William Faulkner for use in his novels and short stories. A once prominent family in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, the family began to fall on hard times in the twentieth century. Principally depicted in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; and in its appendix, they also make appearances in &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; and stories such as &quot;That Evening Sun&quot;. The family name is also referred to briefly in the opening chapter of &quot;Requiem for a Nun&quot;. Faulkner traced their genealogy from 1699 to 1945.

==Compson family members==
Jason Lycurgus Compson I; Quentin MacLachan Compson II (the Old Governor); Gen. Jason Lycurgus Compson II; Jason Richmond Lycurgus Compson III; his wife Caroline Bascomb Compson (–1933); their children Quentin (1891–1910), Jason (born 1894), Candace (known as Caddy), Benjamin (known as Benjy, originally named Maury before his name was changed) (1895–1936); Caddy&#x27;s daughter (Miss) Quentin (born 1911).

<text>David Robert Filo (born April 20, 1966) is an American billionaire businessman and the co-founder of Yahoo! with classmate Jerry Yang. His Filo Server Program, written in the C programming language, was the server-side software used to dynamically serve variable web pages, called Filo Server Pages, on visits to early versions of the Yahoo! website.

==Early life and education==
Filo was born in Wisconsin and was raised in Moss Bluff, Louisiana. He earned a B.S. degree in computer engineering at Tulane University (through the Dean&#x27;s Honor Scholarship) and an M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1990 at Stanford University.

==Career==
In February 1994, he co-created with Jerry Yang an Internet website called &quot;Jerry and David&#x27;s Guide to the World Wide Web&quot;, consisting of a directory of other websites. It was renamed &quot;Yahoo!&quot; (an exclamation). Yahoo! became very popular, and Filo and Yang realized the business potential and co-founded Yahoo! Inc.

Yahoo! started off as a web portal with a web directory providing an extensive range of products and services for various online activities. Yahoo was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. It is still one of the leading internet brands and, due to partnerships with telecommunications firms, is one of the most visited websites on the internet.

==Personal life==
Filo is married to photographer and teacher Angela Buenning, a graduate of Stanford (1993) and Berkeley (1999). They have one child, and live in Palo Alto, California.

In 2005, he gave $30 million to his alma mater, Tulane University, for use in its School of Engineering.

The Filos have been major benefactors of both Stanford, especially its schools of sustainability and education, and Berkeley, primarily its graduate school of journalism.

As of September 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Filo to be worth $4.3 billion, ranking him the 379th-richest person in the world.

<doc id="315084" wikidata="Q1069953" url="?curid=315084" title="Lip reading">
<text>Lip reading, also known as speechreading, is a technique of understanding a limited range of speech by visually interpreting the movements of the lips, face and tongue without sound. Estimates of the range of lip reading vary, with some figures as low as 30% because lip reading relies on context, language knowledge, and any residual hearing. Although lip reading is used most extensively by deaf and hard-of-hearing people, most people with normal hearing process some speech information from sight of the moving mouth.

== Process ==

Although speech perception is considered to be an auditory skill, it is intrinsically multimodal, since producing speech requires the speaker to make movements of the lips, teeth and tongue which are often visible in face-to-face communication. Information from the lips and face supports aural comprehension and most fluent listeners of a language are sensitive to seen speech actions (see McGurk effect). The extent to which people make use of seen speech actions varies with the visibility of the speech action and the knowledge and skill of the perceiver.

===Phonemes and visemes===
The phoneme is the smallest detectable unit of sound in a language that serves to distinguish words from one another. /pit/ and /pik/ differ by one phoneme and refer to different concepts. Spoken English has about 44 phonemes. For lip reading, the number of visually distinctive units - visemes - is much smaller, thus several phonemes map onto a few visemes. This is because many phonemes are produced within the mouth and throat, and are hard to see. These include glottal consonants and most gestures of the tongue. Voiced and unvoiced pairs look identical, such as [p] and [b], [k] and [g], [t] and [d], [f] and [v], and [s] and [z]; likewise for nasalisation (e.g. [m] vs. [b]). are words that look similar when lip read, but which contain different phonemes. Because there are about three times as many phonemes as visemes in English, it is often claimed that only 30% of speech can be lip read. Homophenes are a crucial source of mis-lip reading.

===Co-articulation===
Visemes can be captured as still images, but speech unfolds in time. The smooth articulation of speech sounds in sequence can mean that mouth patterns may be &#x27;shaped&#x27; by an adjacent phoneme: the &#x27;th&#x27; sound in &#x27;tooth&#x27; and in &#x27;teeth&#x27; appears very different because of the vocalic context. This feature of dynamic speech-reading affects lip-reading &#x27;beyond the viseme&#x27;.

===How can it &#x27;work&#x27; with so few visemes?===
While visemes offer a useful starting point for understanding lipreading, spoken distinctions within a viseme can be distinguished and can help support identification.
Moreover, the statistical distribution of phonemes within the lexicon of a language is uneven. While there are clusters of words which are phonemically similar to each other (&#x27;lexical neighbors&#x27;, such as spit/sip/sit/stick...etc.), others are unlike all other words: they are &#x27;unique&#x27; in terms of the distribution of their phonemes (&#x27;umbrella&#x27; may be an example). Skilled users of the language bring this knowledge to bear when interpreting speech, so it is generally harder to identify a heard word with many lexical neighbors than one with few neighbors. Applying this insight to seen speech, some words in the language can be unambiguously lip-read even when they contain few visemes - simply because no other words could possibly &#x27;fit&#x27;.

===Variation in readability and skill===
Many factors affect the visibility of a speaking face, including illumination, movement of the head/camera, frame-rate of the moving image and distance from the viewer (see e.g.). Head movement that accompanies normal speech can also improve lip-reading, independently of oral actions. However, when lip-reading connected speech, the viewer&#x27;s knowledge of the spoken language, familiarity with the speaker and style of speech, and the context of the lip-read material are as important as the visibility of the speaker. While most hearing people are sensitive to seen speech, there is great variability in individual speechreading skill. Good lipreaders are often more accurate than poor lipreaders at identifying phonemes from visual speech.

A simple visemic measure of &#x27;lipreadability&#x27; has been questioned by some researchers. The &#x27;phoneme equivalence class&#x27; measure takes into account the statistical structure of the lexicon and can also accommodate individual differences in lip-reading ability. In line with this, excellent lipreading is often associated with more broad-based cognitive skills including general language proficiency, executive function and working memory.

==Lipreading and language learning in hearing infants and children==

===The first few months===

Seeing the mouth plays a role in the very young infant&#x27;s early sensitivity to speech, and prepares them to become speakers at 1 – 2 years. In order to imitate, a baby must learn to shape their lips in accordance with the sounds they hear; seeing the speaker may help them to do this. Newborns imitate adult mouth movements such as sticking out the tongue or opening the mouth, which could be a precursor to further imitation and later language learning. Infants are disturbed when audiovisual speech of a familiar speaker is desynchronized and tend to show different looking patterns for familiar than for unfamiliar faces when matched to (recorded) voices. Infants are sensitive to McGurk illusions months before they have learned to speak. These studies and many more point to a role for vision in the development of sensitivity to (auditory) speech in the first half-year of life.

===The next six months; a role in learning a native language===

Until around six months of age, most hearing infants are sensitive to a wide range of speech gestures - including ones that can be seen on the mouth - which may or may not later be part of the phonology of their native language. But in the second six months of life, the hearing infant shows perceptual narrowing for the phonetic structure of their own language - and may lose the early sensitivity to mouth patterns that are not useful. The speech sounds /v/ and /b/ which are visemically distinctive in English but not in Castilian Spanish are accurately distinguished in Spanish-exposed and English-exposed babies up to the age of around 6 months. However, older Spanish-exposed infants lose the ability to &#x27;see&#x27; this distinction, while it is retained for English-exposed infants. Such studies suggest that rather than hearing and vision developing in independent ways in infancy, multimodal processing is the rule, not the exception, in (language) development of the infant brain.

===Early language production: one to two years===

Given the many studies indicating a role for vision in the development of language in the pre-lingual infant, the effects of congenital blindness on language development are surprisingly small. 18-month-olds learn new words more readily when they hear them, and do not learn them when they are shown the speech movements without hearing. However, children blind from birth can confuse /m/ and /n/ in their own early production of English words – a confusion rarely seen in sighted hearing children, since /m/ and /n/ are visibly distinctive, but auditorially confusable. The role of vision in children aged 1–2 years may be less critical to the production of their native language, since, by that age, they have attained the skills they need to identify and imitate speech sounds. However, hearing a non-native language can shift the child&#x27;s attention to visual and auditory engagement by way of lipreading and listening in order to process, understand and produce speech.

===In childhood===
Studies with pre-lingual infants and children use indirect, non-verbal measures to indicate sensitivity to seen speech. &quot;Explicit&quot; lip-reading can be reliably tested in hearing preschoolers by asking them to &#x27;say aloud what I say silently&#x27;. In school-age children, lipreading of familiar closed-set words such as number words can be readily elicited. Individual differences in lip-reading skill, as tested by asking the child to &#x27;speak the word that you lip-read&#x27;, or by matching a lip-read utterance to a picture, show a relationship between lip-reading skill and age.

==In hearing adults: lifespan considerations==
While lip-reading silent speech poses a challenge for most hearing people, adding sight of the speaker to heard speech improves speech processing under many conditions. The mechanisms for this, and the precise ways in which lip-reading helps, are topics of current research.
Seeing the speaker helps at all levels of speech processing from phonetic feature discrimination to interpretation of pragmatic utterances.
The positive effects of adding vision to heard speech are greater in noisy than quiet environments,
where by making speech perception easier, seeing the speaker can free up cognitive resources, enabling deeper processing of speech content.

As hearing becomes less reliable in old-age, people may tend to rely more on lip-reading, and are encouraged to do so. However, greater reliance on lip-reading may not always make good the effects of age-related hearing loss. Cognitive decline in aging may be preceded by and/or associated with measurable hearing loss. Thus lipreading may not always be able to fully compensate for the combined hearing and cognitive age-related decrements.

===In specific (hearing) populations===

A number of studies report anomalies of lipreading in populations with distinctive developmental disorders. Autism: People with autism may show reduced lipreading abilities and reduced reliance on vision in audiovisual speech perception. This may be associated with gaze-to-the-face anomalies in these people. Williams syndrome: People with Williams syndrome show some deficits in speechreading which may be independent of their visuo-spatial difficulties. Specific Language Impairment: Children with SLI are also reported to show reduced lipreading sensitivity, as are people with dyslexia.

==Deafness==
Debate has raged for hundreds of years over the role of lip-reading (&#x27;oralism&#x27;) compared with other communication methods (most recently, total communication) in the education of deaf people. The extent to which one or other approach is beneficial depends on a range of factors, including level of hearing loss of the deaf person, age of hearing loss, parental involvement and parental language(s). Then there is a question concerning the aims of the deaf person and their community and carers. Is the aim of education to enhance communication generally, to develop sign language as a first language, or to develop skills in the spoken language of the hearing community? Researchers now focus on which aspects of language and communication may be best delivered by what means and in which contexts, given the hearing status of the child and her family, and their educational plans. Bimodal bilingualism (proficiency in both speech and sign language) is one dominant current approach in language education for the deaf child.

Deaf people are often better lip-readers than people with normal hearing. Some deaf people practice as professional lipreaders for instance in forensic lipreading. In deaf people who have a cochlear implant, pre-implant lip-reading skill can predict post-implant (auditory or audiovisual) speech processing. In adults, the later the age of implantation, the better the visual speechreading abilities of the deaf person. For many deaf people, access to spoken communication can be helped when a spoken message is relayed via a trained, &quot;professional lip-speaker&quot;.

In connection with lipreading and literacy development, children born deaf typically show delayed development of literacy skills which can reflect difficulties in acquiring elements of the spoken language. In particular, reliable phoneme-grapheme mapping may be more difficult for deaf children, who need to be skilled speech-readers in order to master this necessary step in literacy acquisition. Lip-reading skill is associated with literacy abilities in deaf adults and children and training in lipreading may help to develop literacy skills.

Cued Speech uses lipreading with accompanying hand shapes that disambiguate the visemic (consonant) lipshape. Cued speech is said to be easier for hearing parents to learn than a sign language, and studies, primarily from Belgium, show that a deaf child exposed to cued speech in infancy can make more efficient progress in learning a spoken language than from lipreading alone. The use of cued speech in cochlear implantation for deafness is likely to be positive. A similar approach, involving the use of handshapes accompanying seen speech, is Visual Phonics, which is used by some educators to support the learning of written and spoken language.

==Teaching and training==
The aim of teaching and training in lipreading is to develop awareness of the nature of lipreading, and to practice ways of improving the ability to perceive speech &#x27;by eye&#x27;. While the value of lipreading training in improving &#x27;hearing by eye&#x27; was not always clear, especially for people with acquired hearing loss, there is evidence that systematic training in alerting students to attend to seen speech actions can be beneficial. Lipreading classes, often called &quot;lipreading and managing hearing loss classes&quot;, are mainly aimed at adults who have hearing loss. The highest proportion of adults with hearing loss have an age-related, or noise-related loss; with both of these forms of hearing loss, the high-frequency sounds are lost first. Since many of the consonants in speech are high-frequency sounds, speech becomes distorted. Hearing aids help but may not cure this. Lipreading classes have been shown to be of benefit in UK studies commissioned by the Action on Hearing Loss charity (2012).

Trainers recognise that lipreading is an inexact art. Students are taught to watch the lips, tongue and jaw movements, to follow the stress and rhythm of language, to use their residual hearing, with or without hearing aids, to watch expression and body language, and to use their ability to reason and deduce. They are taught the lipreaders&#x27; alphabet, groups of sounds that look alike on the lips (visemes) like p, b, m, or f, v. The aim is to get the gist, so as to have the confidence to join in conversation and avoid the damaging social isolation that often accompanies hearing loss. Lipreading classes are recommended for anyone who struggles to hear in noise, and help to adjust to hearing loss.

=== Tests ===
Most tests of lipreading were devised to measure individual differences in performing specific speech-processing tasks and to detect changes in performance following training. Lipreading tests have been used with relatively small groups in experimental settings, or as clinical indicators with individual patients and clients. That is, most lipreading tests to date have limited validity as markers of lipreading skill in the general population.

==Lipreading and lip-speaking by machine==
Automated lip-reading has been a topic of interest in computational engineering, as well as in science fiction movies. The computational engineer Steve Omohundro, among others, pioneered its development. In facial animation, the aim is to generate realistic facial actions, especially mouth movements, that simulate human speech actions. Computer algorithms to deform or manipulate images of faces can be driven by heard or written language. Systems may be based on detailed models derived from facial movements (motion capture); on anatomical modelling of actions of the jaw, mouth and tongue; or on mapping of known viseme- phoneme properties. Facial animation has been used in speechreading training (demonstrating how different sounds &#x27;look&#x27;). These systems are a subset of speech synthesis modelling which aim to deliver reliable &#x27;text-to-(seen)-speech&#x27; outputs. A complementary aim—the reverse of making faces move in speech—is to develop computer algorithms that can deliver realistic interpretations of speech (i.e. a written transcript or audio record) from natural video data of a face in action: this is facial speech recognition. These models too can be sourced from a variety of data. Automatic visual speech recognition from video has been quite successful in distinguishing different languages (from a corpus of spoken language data). Demonstration models, using machine-learning algorithms, have had some success in lipreading speech elements, such as specific words, from video and for identifying hard-to-lipread phonemes from visemically similar seen mouth actions. Machine-based speechreading is now making successful use of neural-net based algorithms which use large databases of speakers and speech material (following the successful model for auditory automatic speech recognition).

Uses for machine lipreading could include automated lipreading of video-only records, automated lipreading of speakers with damaged vocal tracts, and speech processing in face-to-face video (i.e. from videophone data). Automated lipreading may help in processing noisy or unfamiliar speech. Automated lipreading may contribute to biometric person identification, replacing password-based identification.

==The brain==
Following the discovery that auditory brain regions, including Heschl&#x27;s gyrus, were activated by seen speech, the neural circuitry for speechreading was shown to include supra-modal processing regions, especially superior temporal sulcus (all parts) as well as posterior inferior occipital-temporal regions including regions specialised for the processing of faces and biological motion. In some but not all studies, activation of Broca&#x27;s area is reported for speechreading, suggesting that articulatory mechanisms can be activated in speechreading. Studies of the time course of audiovisual speech processing showed that sight of speech can prime auditory processing regions in advance of the acoustic signal. Better lipreading skill is associated with greater activation in (left) superior temporal sulcus and adjacent inferior temporal (visual) regions in hearing people. In deaf people, the circuitry devoted to speechreading appears to be very similar to that in hearing people, with similar associations of (left) superior temporal activation and lipreading skill.

<text>Douglas James Rain (May 9, 1928 – November 11, 2018) was a Canadian actor. Although primarily a stage actor, he is best-known for voicing HAL 9000, the supercomputer in the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and its sequel &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984). He co-founded the Stratford Festival, and was nominated for a Tony Award for the Broadway play &quot;Vivat! Vivat Regina!&quot;.

== Early life ==
Rain was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Scottish parents Mary and James Rain. His father was a rail yard switchman and his mother was a nurse. His parents emigrated to Canada from Glasgow, Scotland.

He graduated with a B.A. from the University of Manitoba in 1950, then studied acting at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Banff, Alberta and the Old Vic Theatre School in London, England. 

== Career ==
Rain was a founding member of the Stratford Festival of Canada in 1953 and was associated with it as an actor until 1998.

He performed a wide variety of theatrical roles, such as a production of &quot;Henry V&quot; staged in Stratford, Ontario, that was adapted for television in 1966. In 1972, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Dramatic) for his performance in &quot;Vivat! Vivat Regina!&quot;

=== Voice of the HAL 9000 computer ===
Stanley Kubrick cast Rain as the voice of the HAL 9000 computer for the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) after hearing his narration of a short documentary titled &quot;Universe&quot; and later chose him as &quot;the creepy voice of HAL&quot;. In the film, his voice was also sometimes processed with an electronic device called the Eltro information rate changer.

Rain reprised the role for the sequel &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984). He also briefly parodied it in a sketch on &quot;Second City Television&quot; where Merv Griffin (played by Rick Moranis) takes his talk show into outer space.

== Personal life and death ==
Rain was married twice, first to Lois Shaw and then to Martha Henry, who was also an actress on stage, film and television, and had three children and a grandchild. He died of natural causes on November 11, 2018, at the age of 90, at St. Mary&#x27;s Memorial Hospital in St. Marys, Ontario.

<text>Andrea Pia Yates ( Kennedy; born July 2, 1964) is an American woman from Houston, Texas, who confessed to drowning her five children in their bathtub on June 20, 2001. The case of Yateswho had exhibited severe postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis, and schizophrenia leading up to the murdersplaced the M&#x27;Naghten rules, along with the irresistible impulse test for sanity, under close public scrutiny in the United States.

At Yates&#x27; 2002 trial, Chuck Rosenthal, the district attorney in Harris County, asked for the death penalty. Yates was convicted of capital murder, but the jury refused the death penalty option. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after forty years. The verdict was overturned on appeal, in light of false testimony by one of the supposed expert psychiatric witnesses.

On July 26, 2006, a Texas jury in her retrial found that Yates was not guilty by reason of insanity. She was consequently committed by the court to the high-security North Texas State Hospital in Vernon, where she received medical treatment and was a roommate of Dena Schlosser, another woman who committed infanticide by killing her infant daughter. In January 2007, Yates was moved to Kerrville State Hospital, a low-security state mental hospital in Kerrville, Texas.

==Background==
Andrea Yates was born Andrea Pia Kennedy in Houston, Texas, the youngest of the five children of Jutta Karin Koehler, a German immigrant, and Andrew Emmett Kennedy, whose parents were Irish immigrants. Yates suffered from bulimia and depression during her teenage years, and at age 17 spoke to a friend about suicide.

Yates graduated from Milby High School in 1982. She was the class valedictorian, captain of the swim team, and an officer in the National Honor Society. Yates then completed a two-year pre-nursing program at the University of Houston and graduated from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. 

From 1986 until 1994, Yates worked as a registered nurse at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. In summer 1989, she met Russell &quot;Rusty&quot; Yates, a NASA engineer, at the Sunscape Apartments in Houston. They soon moved in together and were married on April 17, 1993.

Yates and her husband, a devout evangelical Christian, announced that they &quot;would seek to have as many babies as nature allowed&quot; and bought a four-bedroom house in Friendswood, Texas. Their first child, Noah, was born in February 1994, just before Rusty accepted a job offer in Florida, causing them to relocate to a small trailer in Seminole. By the time of the birth of their third child, Paul, they had moved back to Houston and purchased a GMC motor home.

Following the birth of her fourth child, Luke, Yates&#x27; depression resurfaced. On June 16, 1999, Rusty found her shaking and chewing her fingers. The next day, she attempted suicide by overdosing on pills, leading to her being hospitalized and prescribed antidepressants. Soon after her release, Yates begged Rusty to let her die as she held a knife up to her neck. Once again hospitalized, she was given a plethora of medications, including Haldol, an anti-psychotic drug. Yates&#x27; condition improved immediately, and she was prescribed it upon her release. After this incident, Rusty moved the family into a small house for the sake of her health. She appeared temporarily stabilized.

In July 1999, Yates had a nervous breakdown, which culminated in two suicide attempts and two psychiatric hospitalizations that summer. She was subsequently diagnosed with postpartum psychosis.

Yates&#x27;s first psychiatrist, Dr. Eileen Starbranch, testified that she urged her and Rusty not to have any more children, as it would &quot;guarantee future psychotic depression.&quot; They conceived their fifth and final child approximately seven weeks after her discharge. Yates stopped taking Haldol in March 2000 and gave birth to her daughter, Mary, nine months later.

Yates seemed to be coping well until the death of her father on March 12, 2001. She then stopped taking medication, mutilated herself, read the Bible feverishly, and stopped feeding Mary. She became so incapacitated that she required immediate hospitalization. On April 1, 2001, Yates came under the care of Dr. Mohammed Saeed; she was treated and released. On May 3, 2001, she degenerated back into a &quot;near catatonic&quot; state and filled the bathtub in the middle of the day; she would later confess to police that she had planned to drown the children that day but had decided against doing it then. Yates was hospitalized the next day after a scheduled doctor visit; her psychiatrist determined she was probably suicidal and assumed she had filled the tub to drown herself.

==Murders==
At the time of the murders, the Yates family was living in the Houston suburb of Clear Lake City. Yates continued under Dr. Saeed&#x27;s care until June 20, 2001, when Rusty left for work, leaving her alone to watch the children against Dr. Saeed&#x27;s instructions to supervise her around the clock. Rusty&#x27;s mother, Dora Yates, had been scheduled to arrive an hour later to take over for Andrea. In the space of that hour, Andrea Yates drowned all five children.

Yates started with Paul, Luke, and John and then laid them in her bed. She then drowned Mary, whom she left floating in the tub. Noah came in and asked what was wrong with Mary. He then ran, but Yates soon caught and drowned him. She left him floating in the tub, and laid Mary in John&#x27;s arms in the bed. She then called the police, repeatedly saying she needed an officer but refusing to say why. She then called Rusty and told him to come home right away.

==Trials==
Yates confessed to drowning her children. Prior to her second trial, she told Dr. Michael Welner that she waited for Rusty to leave for work that morning before filling the bathtub because she knew he would have prevented her from harming them. After the murders, police found the family dog locked up; Rusty advised Welner that it had normally been allowed to run free, and was so when he had left the house, leading the psychiatrist to allege that she locked it in a cage to prevent it from interfering with her killing the children one by one. Rusty got a family friend, George Parnham, to act as her attorney.

Although the defense&#x27;s expert testimony agreed that Yates was psychotic, Texas law requires that, in order to successfully assert the insanity defense, the defendant must prove that they could not discern right from wrong at the time of the crime. In March 2002, a jury rejected the insanity defense and found Yates guilty. Although the prosecution had sought the death penalty, the jury refused that option. The trial court sentenced Yates to life imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with eligibility for parole in forty years.

On January 6, 2005, a Texas Court of Appeals reversed the convictions, because California psychiatrist and prosecution witness Dr. Park Dietz admitted he had given materially false testimony during the trial. In his testimony, Dietz had stated that shortly before the murders, an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; had aired featuring a woman who drowned her children and was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity. Author Suzanne O&#x27;Malley, who was covering the trial for &quot;&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine,&quot; and NBC News, had previously been a writer for &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and immediately reported that no such episode existed. The appellate court held unanimously that the jury might have been influenced by Dietz&#x27; false testimony, and therefore a new trial would be necessary (&quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; did air an episode two years later based in part on Yates&#x27; case).

On January 9, 2006, Yates again entered pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity. On February 1, 2006, she was granted release on bail on the condition that she be admitted to a mental health treatment facility. On July 26, 2006, after three days of deliberations, Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity, as defined by the state of Texas. She was thereafter committed to the North Texas State Hospital–Vernon Campus. In January 2007, she was moved to the Kerrville State Hospital, a low security mental facility in Kerrville, Texas.

Although psychiatrists for both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Yates was severely mentally ill with one of several psychotic diseases at the time she killed her children, the state of Texas asserted that she was, by legal definition, aware enough to judge her actions as right or wrong—despite her mental defect. The prosecution further implied spousal revenge as motive for the killings, despite the conclusion of defense experts that there was no evidence to support such a motive. Although the original jury believed she was legally aware of her actions, they disagreed that her motive was spousal revenge.

===Rusty Yates===
According to trial testimony in 2006, Dr. Saeed advised Rusty Yates not to leave his wife unattended. However, Rusty began leaving her alone with the children in the weeks leading up to the drownings for short periods of time, apparently believing it would improve her independence, despite her doctors&#x27; instructions. Rusty had announced at a family gathering the weekend before the drownings that he had decided to leave Yates home alone for an hour each morning and evening, so that she would not become totally dependent on him and his mother for her maternal responsibilities.

Andrea Yates&#x27; brother, Brian Kennedy, claimed during a broadcast of CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that Rusty expressed to him in 2001, while transporting her to a mental treatment facility, that all depressed people needed was a &quot;swift kick in the pants&quot; to get them motivated. Her mother expressed shock when she heard of Rusty&#x27;s plan while at the gathering with them, saying Yates wasn&#x27;t stable enough to care for the children. She noted that Yates demonstrated she wasn&#x27;t in her right mind when she nearly choked Mary by trying to feed her solid food.

According to authors Suzy Spencer and Suzanne O&#x27;Malley, who investigated her story in great detail, it was during a phone call Dr. Saeed made to Rusty during the breaking news of the killings that Saeed first learned that she was not being supervised full time. Yates&#x27; first psychiatrist, Dr. Starbranch, says she was shocked to disbelief when, during an office visit with the couple, they expressed a desire to discontinue her medications so she could become pregnant again. She warned and counseled them against having more children, and noted in the medical record two days later: &quot;Apparently patient and husband plan to have as many babies as nature will allow! This will surely guarantee future psychotic depression.&quot; Nevertheless, Yates became pregnant with her fifth child, Mary, only seven weeks after being discharged from Dr. Starbranch&#x27;s care on January 12, 2000.

Rusty stated to the media he was never told by psychiatrists that Yates was psychotic nor that she could harm the children, and that, had he known otherwise, he would have never had more children. &quot;If I&#x27;d known she was psychotic, we&#x27;d never have even considered having more kids,&quot; he told the &quot;Dallas Observer.&quot;&quot; However, Yates revealed to her prison psychiatrist, Dr. Melissa Ferguson, that prior to their last child, &quot;she had told Rusty that she did not want to have sex because Dr. Starbranch had said she might hurt her children.&quot; Rusty, she said, simply asserted his procreative religious beliefs, complimented her as a good mother and persuaded her that she could handle more children.

O&#x27;Malley highlighted Rusty&#x27;s continuing sense of unreality regarding having more children:

===Medical community===
Rusty contended that as a psychiatrist, Dr. Saeed was responsible for recognizing and properly treating Yates&#x27; psychosis, not a medically untrained person like himself. He claimed that, despite his urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed had refused to continue her regimen of the anti-psychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999:

Rusty added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.

===Anti-depressants and homicidal ideation===
Rusty and his relatives claimed a combination of antidepressants improperly prescribed by Dr. Saeed in the days before the tragedy were responsible for Yates&#x27; psychotic behavior. According to Dr. Moira Dolan, executive director of the Medical Accountability Network, &quot;homicidal ideation&quot; was added to the warning label of the antidepressant drug Effexor as a rare adverse event in 2005. Yates, she said, had been taking 450 mg, twice the recommended maximum dose, for a month before killing her children.

Dr. Lucy Puryear, an expert witness hired by Yates&#x27; defense team, countered this contention regarding the administration of her antidepressants, saying the dosages prescribed by Dr. Saeed are not uncommon in practice and had nothing at all to do with her re-emergent psychosis. She suggested rather that Yates&#x27; psychosis returned as a result of the Haldol having been discontinued by her doctor two weeks earlier. The oral form of Haldol takes 4–6 days after discontinuation to reach a terminal plasma level of under 1.5%—a medical standard for &quot;complete&quot; elimination of a drug from the body.

===Religious influences===
Media outlets alleged that Michael Woroniecki, an itinerant preacher whom Rusty had met while attending Auburn University, bore some responsibility for the deaths due to certain teachings which were found in his newsletter titled &quot;The Perilous Times,&quot; which the Yateses had received on occasion, and which was entered into evidence at the trial. 

Both Woroniecki and Rusty have rejected these accusations. Rusty said that his family&#x27;s relationship with Woroniecki was not that close and that Woroniecki did not cause her delusions. Woroniecki maintained that his correspondence with them was intended to help them strengthen their marriage and find the love that he says his own family had found in Jesus. Both men agreed that the alleged connection between his message and her mental state was &quot;nothing more than media-created fiction.&quot;

While in prison, Yates stated that she had considered killing the children for two years, adding that they thought she was not a good mother and claiming that her sons were developing improperly. She told her jail psychiatrist: &quot;It was the seventh deadly sin. My children weren&#x27;t righteous. They stumbled because I was evil. The way I was raising them, they could never be saved. They were doomed to perish in the fires of hell.&quot;

==Divorce==
In August 2004, Rusty filed for divorce, stating that he and Yates had not lived together as a married couple since the day of the murders. The divorce was granted on March 17, 2005, after which Rusty began dating Laura Arnold. They married on March 25, 2006, and had one son. Arnold filed for divorce in 2015.

<text>The Cubby Creatures are the musical arm of The Cubby, a San Francisco-based art collective practicing awareness of the Cubby, the collective&#x27;s art-based philosophy of living. One of their mottos is &quot;Revolution through inspired living.&quot;

==Biography==
The Cubby Creatures were born out of San Francisco&#x27;s Mission District in 1997, the musical arm of artist collective the Cubby. Jol Devitro née Joel Perez (guitars, vocals) and Brian Weaver (bass, vocals) formed the group, and the band&#x27;s first lineup featured Emily Limón née Davis (violin), Karl Soehnlein (now writer K.M. Soehnlein) (clarinet), and Matt Mahnke (drums and samples). The lineup later included Jason Gonzales (drums) and Bill Fisher (keyboards, vocals).

The band played its first show at Artists&#x27; Television Access in San Francisco (Dec. 7, 1997) and continued to play out in various clubs and galleries in the Bay Area, as well as touching down sporadically in other parts of California, through 2006. In 2000 they appeared in New York City as part of CMJ&#x27;s annual marathon.

They began publishing their zine &quot;The Cubby Missalette&quot; in 1997. It continues to be published to this day.

They created the Web site cubby.net in 1998. As of 2011, the site houses Cubby Control Records, the label launched by Brian Weaver. The Cubby Creatures&#x27; catalog is available there, along with those of Cubby friends Reptiel, Thee Druggles, Blac Mäjik, and Cubby Creatures progenitor Coolidge, as well as Weaver&#x27;s &quot;Embryo Compilations.&quot;

In 1998 the band produced and performed its original rock opera &quot;The World of Tina&quot; and followed it up with 2000&#x27;s indie-rock variety show &quot;A Telethon for the Benefit of Suzie.&quot; In 2005 they premiered &quot;Jesus Christ, You&#x27;re Crazy&quot;, another rock opera.

The Cubby Creatures, along with Arianne Vasquez, also produced &quot;Cubbyvision&quot; for San Francisco public access channel 29 from 2000 to 2002. Members of the band appeared frequently amongst a cast of recurring characters that included Huck Forest, Mr. Fantastic, the Reverend Myrtle Motivation (played by real-life Cubby chaplain Trismegista Taylor), Rhoda &quot;the apocryphal sister of the Virgin Mary&quot; and Kathy Barra (title character of the 2001 Cubby Creatures EP &quot;Who Remembers Kathy Barra?&quot;, brought to life here by John Vlahides).

==Recordings==
The recorded output of the Cubby Creatures includes:

*&quot;A Very Cubby Christmas&quot; (1997), a self-released audio collage.
*&quot;The Blessed Invention&quot; (2000), their first full-length album, self-released.
*&quot;Who Remembers Kathy Barra?&quot; (2001), an EP offered on CD and 10-inch vinyl that appeared on San Francisco&#x27;s Rodent Records.
*&quot;Three Sides of Cubby&quot; (2002), a 7-inch vinyl record, also on the Rodent Records label.

<doc id="315094" wikidata="Q4401164" url="?curid=315094" title="Darlie Routier">
<text>Darlie Lynn Peck Routier (born January 4, 1970) is an American woman from Rowlett, Texas, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of her five-year-old son Damon in 1996. She has also been charged with capital murder in the death of her six-year-old son, Devon, who was murdered at the same time as Damon. To date, Routier has not been tried for Devon&#x27;s murder.

Damon and Devon were stabbed to death with a large kitchen knife in Routier&#x27;s home, while Routier sustained knife wounds to her throat and arm. Routier told authorities that the crime was perpetrated by an unidentified intruder. During the trial, the prosecution argued that Routier&#x27;s injuries were self-inflicted, that the crime scene had been staged, and that she murdered her sons because of the family&#x27;s financial difficulties; the defense argued that there was no reason Routier would have killed her children, and that the case did not have a motive, a confession, or any witnesses. In February 1997, the jury found Routier guilty of the murder of Damon, and sentenced her to death by lethal injection.

Two appeals filed by Routier, based on allegations of irregularities during the trial, were denied. Since at least 2018, DNA tests have been ordered multiple times after technology has advanced. As of 2024, the results of these tests are still pending. Routier&#x27;s case has been the subject of multiple books and television shows. Routier&#x27;s ex-husband believes that she is innocent.

== Murders ==
On June 6, 1996, at 2:31 a.m., 9-1-1 dispatchers in Rowlett, Texas, received a call from the Routier residence at 5801 Eagle Drive. Routier told the operator that her home had been broken into and that an intruder had stabbed her children, six-year-old Devon and five-year-old Damon, and cut her throat. Police arrived within three minutes of the 9-1-1 call. They discovered a window screen in the garage had been cut, which indicated a possible entry point for an intruder. A search of the house and grounds did not locate an intruder. Having thus secured the site, police permitted paramedics to attend to the victims.

Routier told the police that she had fallen asleep on the couch while watching television with her two sons, waking up later and discovering an unknown man in her house. She stated that as she approached him, the man fled, dropping the knife in a utility room as he ran. After picking up the knife and chasing him away, Routier said she realized that she and her children had been wounded and called 9-1-1. Police found it highly suspicious that Routier claimed she had only awoken after the attack that severely wounded her and her sons.

Routier told police that the assailant escaped through the garage. Investigators said that the garage contained no blood drops, and added that indications were that no one had run through there at all. The window sills in the garage had untouched layers of dust, including the window that had been cut, implying that no one had actually climbed through it, and the mulch in the flower beds between the garage and the backyard gate was undisturbed. However, a fingerprint was found on the windowsill which was determined in 2002 not to belong to anyone in the family. Fingerprint expert Pat Wertheim would later testify before an appeals court that he could not rule out Darlie Routier&#x27;s right ring finger as the source of the print. A bloody sock was discovered 75yards () away from the house. Lab tests revealed it had blood from both of Routier&#x27;s sons on it. It also matched other socks from the Routier house which belonged to her husband Darin.

Both Damon and Devon sustained fatal injuries. Her wounds, described as superficial, came within two millimeters of her carotid artery. Routier was treated at a hospital and released two days later. Her youngest son, 7-month-old Drake, was asleep upstairs with her husband Darin at the time of the murders; both escaped harm. Newscasts showed Routier and other family members holding a birthday party at the boys&#x27; grave to posthumously celebrate Devon&#x27;s seventh birthday eight days after the murders. She was shown smiling and laughing as she sprayed Silly String on the graves in celebration, singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. Family members point out that the newscasts did not show an earlier video that depicted a solemn ceremony honoring the children. Four days later, on June 18, Routier was arrested and charged with capital murder. Routier later commented on the video, saying, &quot;He wanted to be seven. I did the only thing I knew to do to honor him and give him all his wishes because he wasn&#x27;t here anymore. But how do you know what you&#x27;re going to do when you lose two children? How do you know how you&#x27;re going to act?&quot;

==Trial==

Routier&#x27;s trial began on January 6, 1997, in Kerrville, Texas. The prosecution suggested that Routier murdered her sons because of the family&#x27;s financial difficulties and described Routier as &quot;...a self-centered woman, a materialistic woman, and a woman cold enough, in fact, to murder her own two children.” Jurors also saw the Silly String video. Crime scene consultant James Cron testified that evidence suggested the scene inside the Routier residence had been staged.

The prosecution also suggested there was a financial motive for the murders since both boys had a life insurance policy on them. The defense contended that this amounted to only $10,000, not enough to cover their funeral expenses. Furthermore, they asked why, if she was willing to murder for money, she did not kill her husband instead as he had an $800,000 life insurance policy. The defense also questioned why, if she killed her sons to preserve her lavish lifestyle, she left her youngest son, seven-month-old Drake, alive and unharmed.

Routier was represented at trial by lawyer Douglas Mulder. Defense attorneys said that there was no reason why she would have killed her children and that the case did not have a motive, a confession, or any witnesses. They asserted that it was unrealistic to accuse Routier of staging a crime scene. Her attorneys advised her not to appear on the witness stand, but she testified anyway and &quot;withered under cross-examination by prosecutor Toby Shook.&quot;

San Antonio chief medical examiner Vincent DiMaio testified that the wound to Routier&#x27;s neck came within two millimeters of her carotid artery and that it was not consistent with the self-inflicted wounds he had seen in the past. That differed from the assertions of her treating physicians, who had told police officials that the wounds might have been self-inflicted. Tom Bevel testified that cast-off blood found on the back of Routier&#x27;s nightshirt indicated that she had raised the knife over her head as she withdrew it from each boy to stab again.

One crucial aspect of the defense case was the bloody sock found outside the house. While the police contended that this was merely a ruse designed to falsely implicate an intruder had fled the scene, the defense contended that it proved Routier could not have committed the crime. Damon was alive when the paramedics arrived on the scene and the medical examiner testified that the boy could only have survived approximately eight minutes after receiving his injuries. Routier was on the phone with 9-1-1 for almost six minutes. The defense argued that this did not leave enough time for Routier to cut herself, stage the crime scene, plant the sock outside the house, and then return before the paramedics arrived. They also stated that, despite her injuries, Routier&#x27;s blood was not found in the garage or anywhere outside the home. The prosecution countered that Routier could have planted the sock before self-inflicting her own injuries, and the medical examiner&#x27;s stated survival time for Damon after he was stabbed was only an estimation. On February 1, Routier was convicted of murdering Damon. On February 4, she was sentenced to death by lethal injection. Women sentenced to death under Texas law are housed in the Patrick O&#x27;Daniel Unit (formerly Mountain View Unit) in Gatesville, Texas.

==Post-trial claims and appeals==

Defense attorneys allege numerous errors were made during Routier&#x27;s trial and in the official transcript of it, as well as the investigation of the murders, especially at the crime scene. An appeals court dismissed these claims, as did a court ruling on her &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition. In June 2008, Routier was granted the right to new DNA tests. Her appeals were remanded to the state level for improved DNA testing. On January 29, 2014, then-Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas Samuel Frederick Biery Jr. granted a request from prosecution and defense for her case for further DNA tests vital to the defense to be performed on a bloody fingerprint found in the house, a bloody sock and her nightshirt. In 2018, the Criminal District Court No. 3 ordered a third round of DNA testing with the backing of both prosecution and defense.

==Divorce==

In June 2011, Darin Routier filed for divorce from his wife, saying that the decision was mutual and &quot;very difficult,&quot; and that he still believes his wife is innocent. He said that they decided to divorce to end the &quot;limbo&quot; that they had been in since her arrest and conviction. The Routiers&#x27; youngest son Drake still visits his mother in jail. He has been diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Like his father, Drake continues to believe in his mother&#x27;s innocence.

==In media==

===Books===
The 1999 book &quot;Precious Angels: A True Story of Two Slain Children and a Mother Convicted of Murder&quot; by Barbara Davis accounted for Routier&#x27;s guilt. The author has since changed her mind and now supports Routier by donating all the income from the book to her family.

In the 2015 book &quot;Dateline Purgatory: Examining the Case that Sentenced Darlie Routier to Death&quot; journalist Kathy Cruz engages legal experts for their assessments on Routier&#x27;s trial and highlighting the controversies of the death penalty conviction. Throughout the book Cruz collaborates with a former FBI special agent on her examination of the case.

===Television===

An October 1999 episode of the TLC documentary series &quot;Forensic Files&quot; titled &quot;Invisible Intruder&quot; , reports on how detectives discovered who the killer was by analyzing the crime scene&#x27;s blood spatter, Darlie&#x27;s 911 call and the offender profiling of her behavior.


An episode of the CBS News series &quot;48 Hours&quot; titled &quot;Precious Angels&quot; is derived from the true-crime book of the same title, authored by Barbara Davis, which first aired August 10, 2001. CBS correspondent Bill Lagattuta interviewed Darin Routier, the incarcerated Darlie Routier and Davis about the slayings; associated public officials and defense attorneys were also interviewed.

The Investigation Discovery network aired an episode of Werner Herzog&#x27;s series &quot;On Death Row&quot; titled &quot;Darlie Routier&quot; that covered the case in Season 2, Episode 2, broadcast on September 10, 2013.

An American Broadcasting Company (ABC) seven-episode documentary series, &quot;The Last Defense&quot; examines the death row cases of Darlie Routier and Julius Jones. The series premiered on June 12, 2018, profiling Routier&#x27;s case in a four-part episode:

:* &quot;Series Premiere – Darlie Routier: The Crime&quot;, 
:* &quot;Darlie Routier: The Trial&quot;, 
:* &quot;Darlie Routier: The Woman&quot;, 
:* &quot;Darlie Routier: The Fight&quot;, 

Jones&#x27;s sentence has since been commuted to life without parole, while Routier remains on death row.

In 2019, ABC also aired a two-part documentary about Routier&#x27;s case as part of its &quot;20/20&quot; newsmagazine.

In 2020, ITV broadcast the documentary &quot;Death Row&#x27;s Women with Susanna Reid&quot; in which the British journalist travelled to Texas to interview Routier face to face over the course of an hour.

<text>:&quot;There is also a Theophilus of Alexandria&quot; ( 412)
Theophilus of Antioch () was Patriarch of Antioch from 169 until 183. He succeeded Eros of Antioch 169, and was succeeded by Maximus I 183, according to Henry Fynes Clinton, but these dates are only approximations. His death probably occurred between 183 and 185.

His writings (the only remaining being his apology to Autolycus) indicate that he was born a pagan, not far from the Tigris and Euphrates, and was led to embrace Christianity by studying the Holy Scriptures, especially the prophetical books. He makes no reference to his office in his existing writings, nor is any other fact in his life recorded. Eusebius, however, speaks of the zeal which he and the other chief shepherds displayed in driving away the heretics who were attacking Christ&#x27;s flock, with special mention of his work against Marcion. He made contributions to the departments of Christian literature, polemics, exegetics, and apologetics. William Sanday describes him as &quot;one of the precursors of that group of writers who, from Irenaeus to Cyprian, not only break the obscurity which rests on the earliest history of the Church, but alike in the East and in the West carry it to the front in literary eminence, and distance all their heathen contemporaries&quot;.

== Works ==

Eusebius and Jerome mention numerous works of Theophilus existing in their time. They are:
# the existing &quot;Apologia&quot; addressed to Autolycus;
# a work against the heresy of Hermogenes;
# against that of Marcion;
# some catechetical writings;
# Jerome also mentions having read some commentaries on the gospel and on Proverbs, which bore Theophilus&#x27;s name, but which he regarded as inconsistent with the elegance and style of his other works.

== The &quot;Apology to Autolycus&quot; ==
The one undoubted extant work of Theophilus, the 7th Bishop of Antioch ( 169 – 183), is his &quot;Apology to Autolycus&quot; (&quot;Apologia ad Autolycum&quot;), a series of books defending Christianity written to a pagan friend.

The ostensible object of &quot;Ad Autolycum&quot; is to convince a pagan friend, Autolycus, a man of great learning and an earnest seeker after truth, of the divine authority of the Christian religion, while at the same time exhibiting the falsehood and absurdity of paganism. His arguments, drawn almost entirely from the Old Testament, with but very scanty references to the New Testament, are largely chronological. He makes the truth of Christianity depend on his demonstration that the books of the Old Testament were long anterior to the writings of the Greeks and were divinely inspired. Whatever truth the pagan authors contain he regards as borrowed from Moses and the prophets, who alone declare God&#x27;s revelation to man. He contrasts the perfect consistency of the divine oracles, which he regards as a convincing proof of their inspiration, with the inconsistencies of the pagan philosophers. He contrasts the account of the creation of the universe and of man, on which, together with the history contained in the earlier chapters of Genesis, he comments at great length but with singularly little intelligence, with the statements of Plato, &quot;reputed the wisest of all the Greeks&quot;, of Aratus, who had the insight to assert that the earth was spherical, and other Greek writers on whom he pours contempt as mere ignorant retailers of stolen goods. He supplies a series of dates, beginning with Adam and ending with Marcus Aurelius, who had died shortly before he wrote, thus dating this work to the years of the reign of Commodus, 180–192.

Theophilus regards the Sibylline books that were still in Rome as authentic and inspired productions, quoting the Sibylline oracles (scholars dispute that these are the same) largely as declaring the same truths with the prophets. The omission by the Greeks of all mention of the Old Testament from which they draw all their wisdom is ascribed to a self-chosen blindness in refusing to recognize the only God and in persecuting the followers of the only fountain of truth. He can recognize in them no aspirations after the divine life, no earnest gropings after truth, no gleams of the all-illumining light. The pagan religion was a mere worship of idols, bearing the names of dead men. Almost the only point in which he will allow the pagan writers to be in harmony with revealed truth is in the doctrine of retribution and punishment after death for sins committed in life.

Theophilus&#x27;s critical powers were not above his age. He adopts Herodotus&#x27;s derivation of θεός (theòs) from τίθημι (tithemi), since God set all things in order, comparing with it that of Plato from θεεῖν (theein), because the Deity is ever in motion. He asserts that Satan is called the dragon (Greek &quot;drakon&quot;) on account of his having revolted &quot;apode&quot; &quot;draken&quot; &quot;ai&quot; from God, and traces the Bacchanalian cry &quot;Evoe&quot; to the name of Eve as the first sinner. He discovers the reason of blood coagulating on the surface of the ground in the divine word to Cain, the earth struck with terror refusing to drink it in. In addition, Theophilus misquotes Plato several times, ranking Zopyrus among the Greeks, and speaking of Pausanias as having only run a risk of starvation instead of being actually starved to death in the temple of Minerva.

=== Trinity ===
Theophilus&#x27;s apology is most notable for being the earliest extant Christian work to use the word &quot;Trinity&quot; (Greek: τριάς &quot;trias&quot;; English: three), although it does not use the common formula of &quot;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit&quot; to describe the Trinity. Rather, Theophilus himself puts it as &quot;God, his Word (Logos) and his Wisdom (Sophia),&quot; perhaps following the early Christian practice of identifying the Holy Spirit as the Wisdom of God, as he seems to demonstrate in his interpretation of Psalm 33:6, and which is also expressed in the works his contemporary, Irenaeus of Lyon, who commenting on that selfsame verse writes:

&quot;By the word of the Lord were the heavens established, and by his spirit all their power&quot;. Since then the Word establishes, that is to say, gives body and grants the reality of being, and the Spirit gives order and form to the diversity of the powers; rightly and fittingly is the Word called the Son, and the Spirit the Wisdom of God.

This practice served as a way to express Christian doctrine in a way that is more relatable to contemporary views Sophia to ideas found in Greek philosophy or Hellenistic Judaism in which such concepts as Nous (Mind), Logos (Word, Reason) and Sophia (Wisdom) were common. As the Patripassionist heresies arose, however, the formula of &quot;Father, Son, Holy Spirit&quot; became more prominently featured, as such beliefs denied the persons of the Economy (an earlier developed term for the Trinity). As Theophilus does not appear to be introducing the word Trinity in novel fashion, it is probable that the word was in use before this time. The context for his use of the word Trinity is commentary on the successive work of the creation weeks (Genesis chapters 1–3), where Theophilus expresses the Trinity as follows:

The concept of intermediate divine beings was common to Platonism and certain Jewish sects. In Wisdom (as feminine consort) is described as God&#x27;s Counsellor and Workmistress, who dwelt beside Him before the creation of the world.

=== References to the Old and New Testaments ===
The theology of Theophilus was rooted in Jewish ideas and the Hebrew scriptures. Theophilus&#x27;s quotation from the Old Testament scripture is copious, drawing largely from the Pentateuch and to a smaller extent from the other historical books. His references to Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, and Jeremiah are also numerous, and he quotes from Ezekiel, Hosea and other minor prophets. His direct evidence respecting the canon of the New Testament does not go much beyond a few precepts from the Sermon on the Mount, a possible quotation from Luke 18:27, Theophilus seems to have known a collection of Pauline epistles which included at least Romans, I and II Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and the three Pastoral Epistles. More important is a distinct citation from the opening of the Gospel of St. John (1:1-3), mentioning the evangelist by name, as one of the inspired men by whom the Holy Scriptures were written The use of a metaphor found in 2 Peter 1:19 bears on the date of that epistle. According to Eusebius, Theophilus quoted the Book of Revelation in his work against Hermogenes; a very precarious allusion has been seen in ii. 28, cf. Revelation 12:3, 7, etc. A full index of these and other possible references to the Old and New Testament is given by Otto.

Although Theophilus cites the opening of the Gospel of St. John (1:1), he does not go on to speak of the incarnation of the Word and his (Jesus&#x27;s) atoning sacrificial death. While Theophilus makes no mention of the name of Jesus or use the word Christ or the &quot;phrase&quot; Son of God, he identifies the Logos as the Son of God in his second letter, when he writes,For the divine writing itself teaches us that Adam said that he had heard the voice. But what else is this voice but the Word of God, who is also His Son? Not as the poets and writers of myths talk of the sons of gods begotten from intercourse [with women], but as truth expounds, the Word, that always exists, residing within the heart of God. For before anything came into being He had Him as a counsellor, being His own mind and thought. But when God wished to make all that He determined on, He begot this Word, uttered, the first-born of all creation, not Himself being emptied of the Word [Reason], but having begotten Reason, and always conversing with His Reason. And hence the holy writings teach us, and all the spirit-bearing [inspired] men, one of whom, John, says, &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,&quot; showing that at first God was alone, and the Word in Him. Then he says, &quot;The Word was God; all things came into existence through Him; and apart from Him not one thing came into existence.&quot; The Word, then, being God, and being naturally produced from God, whenever the Father of the universe wills, He sends Him to any place; and He, coming, is both heard and seen, being sent by Him and is found in a place.

=== Meaning of term &quot;Christian&quot; ===
Theophilus explains the meaning of the term Christian as follows:
=== Chronology ===
In his third book Theophilus presents a detailed chronology &quot;from the foundation of the world&quot; to emperor Marcus Aurelius. This begins with the Biblical first man Adam through to emperor Marcus Aurelius. Theophilus lived in the reign of this emperor. The chronology puts the creation of the world at about 5529 BC: &quot;All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total of 5,698 years&quot;. He uses this chronology to prove that Moses and the other Hebrew prophets preceded the philosophers. The leading chronological epochs correspond to the Old Testament prophets.

=== Patristic citations ===
The silence regarding his &quot;Apology&quot; in the East is remarkable; we fail to find the work mentioned or quoted by Greek writers before the time of Eusebius. Several passages in the works of Irenaeus show an undoubted relationship to passages in one small section of the &quot;Apologia&quot;, but Harnack thinks it probable that the quotations, limited to two chapters, are not taken from the &quot;Apologia&quot;, but from Theophilus&#x27;s work against Marcion In the West there are a few references to the &quot;Autolycus&quot;. It is quoted by Lactantius under the title &quot;Liber de Temporibus ad Autolycum&quot;. There is a passage first cited by Maranus in Novatian which shows great similarity to the language of Theophilus. In the next century the book is mentioned by Gennadius of Marseilles as &quot;tres libelli de fide&quot;. He found them attributed to Theophilus of Alexandria, but the disparity of style caused him to question the authorship.

== Editions ==
Jacques Paul Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Graeca&quot;, and a small edition (Cambridge 1852) by W. G. Humphry. Johann Carl Theodor von Otto&#x27;s edition in the &quot;Corpus apologetarum christianorum saeculi secundi&quot; vol. ii. (Jena, 1861) is by far the most complete and useful. English translations by Joseph Betty (Oxford 1722), W. B. Flower (London, 1860), Marcus Dods (Clark&#x27;s Ante-Nicene Library), and Robert M. Grant (with the Greek text; Clarendon Press, 1970).

<doc id="315102" wikidata="Q1807851" url="?curid=315102" title="Quinault people">
<text>The Quinault ( or , kʷínayɬ) are a group of Native American peoples from western Washington in the United States. They are a Southwestern Coast Salish people and are enrolled in the federally recognized Quinault Tribe of the Quinault Reservation.

The name &quot;Quinault&quot; is an anglicized (albeit French) version of /ˈkʷinajɬ/, the traditional name of a village at the mouth of the Quinault River, today called Taholah. The river, village, and people were given the anglicized name Quinault in 1787 by the maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley. It is also possible that both names come from a French trapper from the Quinault family who visited the area.

==Lands==
The Quinault Indian Reservation, at , is located on the Pacific coast of Washington, primarily in northwestern Grays Harbor County, with small parts extending north into southwestern Jefferson County. It has a land area of 819.294 km2 (316.331 sq mi) and reported a resident population of 1,370 persons as of the 2000 census. The Quinault people settled onto reservation lands after signing the Quinault Treaty with the former Washington Territory in 1856. About 60% of the reservation&#x27;s population lives in the community of Taholah, on the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Quinault River.

Motorists are cautioned that it is not possible to traverse the entire reservation on Highway 109, in spite of what some online mapping services indicate. Construction of the highway north from Taholah to U.S. Highway 101 was halted in the late 1960s. There is only limited access (for private property owners and tribe members) along the northern coast of the reservation.

Currently, only enrolled members of the Quinault Indian Nation and their guests are allowed onto the beaches throughout the reservation without a pass. Guests can obtain access passes that allow them to use the beaches for the day issued.

==Culture==

===Language===
===Related peoples===
The mixture of members with ethnic ties to the modern Quinault tribe is made up of the Quinault, Hoh, Lower Chehalis, Upper Chehalis, Chinook, Cowlitz, Queets, and Quileute peoples. Linguistically, these groups belong to three language families: Chimakuan (&quot;Quileute&quot;, &quot;Hoh&quot;), Chinookan (&quot;Chinook groups&quot;), and Salishan (&quot;Chehalis&quot;, &quot;Cowlitz&quot;, &quot;Queets&quot;, and &quot;Quinault&quot;).

===Basketry and weaving===

The Quinault people have been noted basket makers and weavers. Baskets were made from locally available materials such as reeds and grasses, spruce, maple and red cedar, and in many styles suited to the task at hand. For instance, burden baskets made for gathering oysters and other shellfish had an open weave to allow for drainage, and were made from water resistant materials like cedar bark. Archaeology has revealed some of the ways basketmaking evolved over time, and the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site, about up the Pacific coast from the present-day Quinault reservation, has been an invaluable site that preserved objects subject to decay, such as baskets and blankets, in a mudslide.

Quinault basket artifacts are in many museums in the Northwest and around the world. The following were notable basket weavers of the Quinault prior to 1960.

There has been some attempt to preserve traditional basketmaking techniques on the Quinault reservation, though the style has been intermixed with that of other tribes.

==Economy==
Many tribes within the Pacific Northwest receive per capita payments from their tribes but the Quinault Indian Nation currently does not. The economy for Quinault Indian Nation is mainly derived from the Quinault Beach Resort and Casino, timber, and various fishing entities (Quinault Pride Seafood, etc.). Quinault Indian Nation is the largest employer within Grays Harbor County.

=== 2002–06: &quot;Sade ve Sadece&quot; and &quot;Uçacaksın&quot; ===
Ergen&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Sade ve Sadece&quot; was released in June 2002 by Neşe Müzik. The album&#x27;s lead single was &quot;Abayı Yaktım&quot;.

=== 2014–present: &quot;Aşkla Aynı Değil&quot; and &quot;Kalbimi Koydum&quot; ===
On 27 September 2014, Ergen married anchorman Erhan Çelik. Their close friends attended the marriage ceremony. Taşkın Sabah and chairman of the board of directors of Ciner Holding, Kenan Tekdağ, were the witnesses of the marriage. The mayor of Selçuk municipality, Dr. Dahi Zeynel Bakıcı, officiated at the wedding. The venue for the marriage was one of the old mansions of the mountain village of Şirince.

In December, Ergen was among the artists featured on the album &quot;Kayahan En İyileri No.1&quot; in tribute to Kayahan. She recorded the song &quot;Devamı Var&quot; for this album.

In April 2015 and before the release of her new album, Ergen released the single &quot;Aşkla Aynı Değil&quot;. The song was written and composed by Oğuzhan Koç. Back in 2009, the two had another collaboration on the song &quot;Giden Günlerim Oldu&quot;. With more than 130 million views on YouTube, &quot;Aşkla Aynı Değil&quot; is Ergen&#x27;s most viewed music video on the platform. In August, she joined TV 8&#x27;s singing competition &quot;Rising Star Türkiye&quot; as a judge, together with Demet Akalın, Mustafa Sandal and Fuat Güner. The program is one of the world&#x27;s first interactive voice contests, with a special application designed for smartphones and tablets, enabling the audiences and judges to vote instantly.

Two years after their marriage, Ergen and Erhan Çelik divorced on 6 December 2016.

After four years, Ergen released her tenth studio album, &quot;Kalbimi Koydum&quot;, on 19 October. The album topped the pre-order section and became the most popular album on iTunes in Turkey. The album&#x27;s lead single, also titled &quot;Kalbimi Koydum&quot;, was written and composed by Bora Duran. The song ranked second on Turkey&#x27;s official music charts. The second music video for this album was released for the song, &quot;Yıkıl Karşımdan&quot;, which was written and composed by Mustafa Sandal and Emina Jahović. On 28 March 2016, the third music video was released for the song &quot;Kusura Bakma&quot;, written by Mert Ekren. The fourth music video for this album was made for the song &quot;Özledim&quot; and was shown to the public at Ergen&#x27;s concert at the Bostancı Show Center. &quot;Yaklaş Yaklaş&quot; was the fifth song from this album to get a music video, which was released on 1 August 2016, followed by a music video for the song &quot;Panda&quot; on 26 September 2016.

In 2017, Gülben Ergen sued Seren Serengil due to the comments she had made about Ergen&#x27;s private life on Star TV&#x27;s program &quot;Duymayan Kalmasın&quot;, and in October 2017 a court in Istanbul ruled that Serengil &quot;could not come closer than 30 meters to Ergen, could not insult her or commit any kind of violence against her&quot; for six months. The court eventually sentenced Serengil to a three-day imprisonment in January 2018.

Since 2017, Ergen has continued her career by releasing the singles &quot;Esasen&quot; (2017), written by Soner Sarıkabadayı, &quot;Yansın Bakalım&quot; (2017), &quot;İnfilak&quot; (2018) and &quot;Bu Benim Hayatım&quot; (2020), written by Sezen Aksu, and &quot;Müsaadenle&quot; (2019), written by Onur Mete and Zuhal Karadeniz.

== Other ventures ==
=== Çocuklar Gülsün Diye ===
Çocuklar Gülsün Diye Association was founded in 2010 by Gülben Ergen as the continuation of the campaign Çocuklar Gülsün Diye. Under Gülben Ergen&#x27;s presidency, and with Elvan Oktar as vice president, the association aims to contribute to the dissemination of pre-school education in Turkey.

A total of 27 kindergartens have been completed and started working under the Ministry of National Education. They have been furnished and provided with all the necessary materials for a contemporary education.

=== &quot;Sürpriz&quot; ===
&quot;Sürpriz&quot; was the title of Gülben Ergen&#x27;s program which aired on atv. Its first episode aired on 14 May 2008 and numerous celebrities and artists were featured on it. As the program started two months after the release of &quot;Aşk Hiç Bitmez&quot;, it allowed Ergen to promote her new album as well. With the appearance of İbrahim Tatlıses in its second week and his ballet performance in the studio, the program achieved a great audience.

=== &quot;Gülbence&quot; ===
&quot;Gülbence&quot; is the title of both Gülben Ergen&#x27;s magazine and her morning program. Ergen used this name due to its similarity to her own first name. The name Gülbence later became strongly associated with Ergen. &quot;Gülbence&quot; was a women&#x27;s magazine published weekly. As Hülya Avşar&#x27;s &quot;Hülya&quot; magazine was being published at the same time, it created the so-called Gülben-Hülya conflict. Ergen&#x27;s morning program &quot;Gülbence&quot; aired on TGRT from 1998 to 2001. The program contributed to the sales of her album &quot;Kör Aşık&quot; and boosted the rating for her TV series &quot;Marziye&quot;, and was again aired in 2006 until Ergen&#x27;s first pregnancy forced her to withdraw from the program. In 2008, however, she returned to television with her news program &quot;Sürpriz&quot;.

=== Gülben&#x27;den Masallar ===
&quot;Gülben&#x27;den Masallar&quot; is the name of Ergen&#x27;s first book, which contains seven different stories. They are primarily about issues such as environmental awareness, brotherly love, friendship, respect for the elderly, nature and animal love, and healthy nutrition. Ergen donated the money from the book&#x27;s sales to the Turkish Education Volunteers Foundation. It was published by Kelime Yayınları, with Ebru Diril serving as the illustrator. Eda Demirbay helped Ergen with writing the book.

=== &quot;Gülben&quot; ===
In 2011, Ergen prepared a new TV program, titled &quot;Gülben&quot;, which aired on TRT daily. In 2013, she continued to present the program on Show TV with the same name. The content of the program was subjects related to life, and especially women. Health, diet, beauty, fashion, decoration, personal development, as well as issues that are closely related to women were the major topics of the program and special guests would be featured on the episodes from time to time.

<doc id="315112" wikidata="Q367124" url="?curid=315112" title="Never Mind the Buzzcocks">
<text>Never Mind the Buzzcocks is a British comedy panel game show with a pop music theme. It has aired on Sky Max since September 2021, having originally aired between November 1996 and January 2015 on BBC Two. The original series was first hosted by Mark Lamarr, then by Simon Amstell, and later by a number of guest presenters, with Rhod Gilbert hosting the final series. It first starred Phill Jupitus and Sean Hughes as team captains, with Hughes being replaced by Bill Bailey from the eleventh series, and Bailey replaced by Noel Fielding for some of series 21 and from series 23 onward. The show returned six years later, now hosted by Greg Davies, with Daisy May Cooper as the new captain and Fielding returning as a captain. The show is produced by Talkback. The title plays on the names of the Sex Pistols album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; and the band Buzzcocks.

The show was known for its dry, sarcastic humour and scathing, provocative attacks on people and objects. It had some controversial guests throughout its initial 18-year run. On 26 May 2015, it was announced that the BBC had decided not to recommission the show, in order to &quot;create space for new entertainment formats&quot;. In September 2020, it was announced that Sky was reviving the show. In June 2021, Sky confirmed that eight episodes and a Christmas special would be shown later in the year, with Davies hosting.

==History==
The show ran on the BBC from 1996 until 2015. From its inception until December 2005, it was presented by Mark Lamarr (who also produced the show from 2004 until his departure). Simon Amstell started hosting in October 2006. Regular team captains include Phill Jupitus, Sean Hughes (until May 2002), Bill Bailey (September 2002 – February 2008), Noel Fielding (October 2009 – December 2014), and also the guest captains (October 2008 – January 2009). Bill Bailey had appeared as a guest in series 4 on Phill Jupitus&#x27; team and series 5 on Sean Hughes&#x27;s team.

At the end of 2005, it was announced that Mark Lamarr was to take a break from the show after 150 episodes, to concentrate on other projects. The series that aired in early 2006 was hosted by guest presenters, before being permanently handed over to Simon Amstell, who had appeared twice as a panellist (series 13, episode 8 and series 16, episode 11), and once as a guest presenter (series 18, episode 2). The first time Amstell appeared as a panellist under Lamarr&#x27;s tenure, coincidentally, Lamarr jokingly accused him of &quot;stealing his act&quot;.

Following series 20 (Amstell&#x27;s second as regular host), a highlights show was broadcast, presented by Alan Yentob as a parody of his own arts series &quot;Imagine&quot;. The highlights programme was sub-titled &quot;Imagine… A Mildly Amusing Panel Show&quot;. From then on, every series included a compilation highlights show, usually including some mockumentary-style &quot;behind the scenes&quot; footage.

Series 20 of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; concluded on 7 March 2007. The show began its 21st series on 15 November 2007 with Simon Amstell as host and Phill Jupitus and Bill Bailey as team captains, although Noel Fielding temporarily replaced Bill Bailey for three episodes of series 21. Series 21 concluded on 14 February 2008.

On 18 September 2008, the BBC announced that Bill Bailey would be leaving the show, after eleven series, to concentrate on other commitments. While Simon Amstell and Phill Jupitus returned for the show&#x27;s 22nd series, Bailey was replaced by a series of guest captains, including comedians Bob Mortimer, Jack Dee, Frank Skinner, Stephen Fry, James Corden, Mark Watson, Russell Brand, producer Mark Ronson and television presenters Dermot O&#x27;Leary and Davina McCall.

On 25 April 2009, Amstell announced via his internet mailing list that he would not be hosting another series of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; because of his desire to concentrate on his live tours and performances instead.
The new series began 1 October with Noel Fielding as a new permanent captain. Guest hosts included Alex James, Dermot O&#x27;Leary, Jack Whitehall, Rhod Gilbert, David Walliams, Claudia Winkleman, Frank Skinner, Frankie Boyle, James Corden, Mark Watson, Martin Freeman and David Tennant.

In 2010, guest hosts continued to present the show&#x27;s 24th series, including Mark Ronson, Jack Dee, Josh Groban, Terry Wogan, Tim Minchin, Robert Webb, Tim Westwood, Catherine Tate, Frankie Boyle (hosting for the second time) and David O&#x27;Doherty, who also hosted a compilation show transmitted on 11 January 2011. On 16 July 2011, the first ever live &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; special was hosted at Latitude. It lasted roughly two hours, was hosted by David O&#x27;Doherty, had the team captains Phil Jupitus and Noel Fielding, and featured guests Seann Walsh, Charlie Baker, Paloma Faith and Robert Milton (standing in for Seasick Steve, who was supposed to be there but never arrived).

On 9 July 2014, it was confirmed that Rhod Gilbert had been named the next permanent host, beginning with series 28 in autumn 2014.

Between 3 June and 22 July 2013, a special eight-part retrospective programme called &quot;What a Load of Buzzcocks&quot; was aired, with narration by Alex James. The show revisited key years and events through classic moments and clips from the show&#x27;s 16-year history.

Phill Jupitus was the only performer to have appeared in almost every original-run episode of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, missing only the recording of series 25, episode 6, where Frankie Boyle filled in as team captain, and a special episode filmed as part of Comic Relief&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;.

&quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; returned in 2021 on Sky Max, with Noel Fielding the only returning panelist; Greg Davies was the new host, Daisy May Cooper the first female team captain, and Jamali Maddix was a regular team member in every episode.

===Rounds===
The show usually consists of four rounds. The first round changed multiple times over the course of the show. In early series it was often &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; (where a music video was paused at a key point and teams had to guess what happened next) or &quot;I Fought The Law&quot; (where teams had to guess which of a given list of crimes or lawsuits a pop star had been involved in, and whether they&#x27;d won or lost their case). Later, it usually consisted of the teams being asked a question concerning a unique fact about a musical artist or artists, such as &quot;Why did Girls Aloud once have to cancel a show?&quot; or &quot;What have we pixelated in this still from a music video?&quot; Sometimes the teams are given options to pick from; at other times they have no help. Alternatively, the first round was &#x27;Connections&#x27; in which the teams are asked to identify the connection between two bands or artists. Series 25 introduced sets of props for the guests to identify as being part of the answer.

The second round is the Intros Round, wherein two members of a team (the captain and usually the musical guest) were asked to convey the introduction of a song a cappella (but using vocal sounds for instruments rather than words) for their teammate to guess. During the Christmas specials, the teams were often given instruments with which to play, though they are usually inappropriate or toy instruments.

The third round is usually the Identity Parade, though this was occasionally replaced by a few other alternative rounds. The audience was shown a video of a musician (often a member of an old band or a &quot;one hit wonder&quot; singer), and the teams have to pick the correct person from a line-up of five people. The audience and people at home are the only ones to see the video, making it harder for the contestants. The host will go through each member of the line-up, giving them humorous names based on either the name of the musician in question or their song. When the series returned in 2021, the Identity Parade instead sometimes included multiple members of a band or even the entire band.

The final round is called Next Lines, in which the host speaks a line of a song and the team has to name the next line of the song. Often the songs chosen are ones mentioned in earlier rounds and ones recorded by panel members. In the latter case, guests often prove incapable of reciting the lyrics to their own songs; for example, Romeo Stodart of The Magic Numbers failed entirely to recognise a line from a song which he joked was &quot;like the B-side from our first single&quot;.

For the Christmas Eve 2006 Bumper Edition, the Next Lines round was omitted in order that the teams, plus a guest band and members of that show&#x27;s Identity Parade, performed a particular song (chosen, in a short skit, by a dreidel). Phill&#x27;s team, with the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, performed Rachel Stevens&#x27; &quot;Some Girls&quot;, and Bill&#x27;s, with the Bollywood Pandits (a Bollywood Bhangra band), performed the Rednex&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Eye Joe&quot;.

In the first series of 2005, Mark Lamarr introduced a new segment after the end of the quiz proper, wherein Lamarr tells the audience out-of-context punchlines which weren&#x27;t used during the show. Often these have included incongruous references to fingerless gloves.

In most of the episodes in the Spring 2006 series, there was an intro or outro sketch where Phill, Bill and Athelston Williams (a frequent member of the lineup in the Identity Parade round) played in a pub band called &quot;Fat, Gifted and Black&quot; (a play on Young, Gifted and Black), or &quot;Athelston, Lake and Palmer&quot; (a play on Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer). The guest presenter would usually be the lead singer for this segment (e. g. Lauren Laverne and Ricky Wilson).

A running joke of the show was for Noel or Phill to remark on passing comments as &quot;good band names&quot;, an example of this being &quot;The Diabetic Squirrels&quot;.

==Cast==

Until series 18, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; was chaired by Mark Lamarr. Until series 10, the team captains were Phill Jupitus and Sean Hughes. After series 10, Hughes departed and was replaced by Bill Bailey. Lamarr left after series 17, and series 18 was chaired by a series of guest hosts. One of these, satirical comedian and former &quot;Popworld&quot; presenter Simon Amstell, took over as presenter from series 19 to series 22. Amstell sent an email to his fans on 24 April 2009, stating &quot;I am Simon Amstell. Here is some news, should you be interested in this sort of thing. I will not be hosting another series of the fun pop quiz, ‘Never Mind the Buzzcocks’. When I first took on the role of hosting ‘Never Mind the Buzzcocks’, my only hope was to bring joy and laughter to the world and if I was lucky, put an end to war, disease and poverty. Now that I have achieved that, I plan to concentrate on my live work.&quot; Series 23 was chaired by a series of guest hosts which continued for series 24 because &quot;none of the guest hosts were good enough&quot; according to the comedic voice over on the first episode of series 24. In July 2014, it was announced that Rhod Gilbert would be the next permanent presenter for the 28th series.

Bill Bailey was unable to attend filming at the beginning of series 21, so Noel Fielding provided cover for three episodes starting 22 November 2007. Bill Bailey officially left the show after series 21 to pursue other commitments. His role as team captain was filled by several &#x27;guest captains&#x27; for series 22 and permanently filled by Fielding from series 23 onward. Apart from one episode in series 25, and the 2011 Comic Relief special, Phill Jupitus appeared in every episode of the programme from its debut in 1996 until it was cancelled in 2015. Jupitus did not return for the revived series on Sky in 2021, making series 29 the first series in which he is not a regular team captain. In series 29, Greg Davies took over as host, Daisy May Cooper replaced Jupitus as team captain and Jamali Maddix joined as a regular panellist. In series 32, Daisy May Cooper does not appear on the show apart from the Christmas episode and is replaced regularly by Sophie Willan and guest captains including Mel B and Courtney Love. 

===Walk-offs and non-airings===
There have been some instances of guests walking off the show, or episodes being pulled from broadcast due to guest behaviour:

* In episode 2 of series 3, Lemmy of Motörhead walked off the show near the end of the episode, purportedly after he realised that Mark Lamarr and most of the other panellists&#x27; jokes were making fun of him (as well as former Bucks Fizz singer Jay Aston). Lemmy&#x27;s walk-off was not shown on air however as by this time, main recording for the show had already finished and only retakes were being shot.
* In episode 3 of series 20, The Ordinary Boys&#x27; lead singer Preston walked off the show after Simon Amstell read extracts from the autobiography of Preston&#x27;s then-wife, Chantelle Houghton. He was replaced by audience member Ed Seymour, picked out by Bill Bailey (on the grounds that he was of the closest physical resemblance that could be found), and credited as &quot;special guest&quot;. Bailey&#x27;s instructions to Seymour were &quot;look surly and, every time [Amstell] mentions Chantelle, say &#x27;that&#x27;s out of order&#x27;&quot;. Coincidentally, Preston had been sitting in the same seat as Lemmy, leading it to be called the &quot;ejector seat&quot; by Phill in the next episode. In an August 2009 interview, Preston admitted that he regretted walking off the show and said that he would return to the programme if asked, saying &quot;I&#x27;m struggling to think why I would have acted so weird&quot;.
* Russell Brand recorded an appearance as guest captain for series 22, but due to the Andrew Sachs prank call scandal that surrounded him, and his suspension—and then resignation—from the BBC, the episode was not broadcast until 19 January 2011.
* In episode 7 of series 27, during the Next Lines round, Huey Morgan of Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals (who had also been sitting in the &quot;ejector seat&quot; and had made frequent prior appearances on the show, including as a guest host in 2006), smashed a mug and walked off at the end of the show just as his team was announced as the winner. Morgan&#x27;s behaviour was believed to be due to guest hosts Rizzle Kicks giving his team Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals lyrics (even though musicians on the show had frequently been given lyrics to their own songs in the round). Both Rizzle Kicks and Noel Fielding made fun of the incident shortly afterwards.
*One episode of series 30 (scheduled for 26 October 2022) was not shown after guest Lady Leshurr was charged with actual bodily harm after a 22 October 2022 incident; the postponed episode was burnt off at 2:15 a.m. and was never made available for streaming or download.

* In 1998–1999 the Dutch-language Belgian TV channel Canvas aired one series of the pop quiz &quot;Nonkel Pop&quot; that was based on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, featuring an intros round, next lines, and similar panels of contestants. The show was hosted by Bart Peeters. The name of the show, which translates as &#x27;Uncle Pop&#x27; was a play on Nonkel Bob (Uncle Bob—real name Bob Davidse), a legendary children&#x27;s TV presenter from the early days of Belgian television. Bart Peeters made his television debut as a child on one of Nonkel Bob&#x27;s shows.
* In 1999 Dweezil and Ahmet Zappa hosted a short-lived one-hour music-themed game show with a somewhat different format on the USA Network called &quot;Happy Hour&quot; (not to be confused with the sitcom of the same name).
* In 2002, an American version of the show on VH1 with the same title, hosted by comedian Marc Maron, lasted for a month. VH1 has since played airings of the classic episodes with Mark Lamarr.
* An official Dutch version, &quot;Doe Maar Normaal&quot; (which translates to &quot;Just act normally&quot;, part of the Dutch proverb &quot;Just act normally, that&#x27;ll be silly enough&quot;, and is also a combination of famous Dutch bands Doe Maar and Normaal), ran for five seasons from 2007 to 2012. It was broadcast by BNN. Regular panel members included TV presenter Dennis Weening and comedian Ruben van der Meer and it was hosted by Ruben Nicolai.
* A popular Australian show, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, hosted by stand-up comedian Adam Hills and presented in a similar style but with different question formats was broadcast on the ABC from 2005 until 2011. It returned for one more season in 2014 with comedian Josh Earl as host. Adam Hills appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2005.
* Despite persistent efforts by Foxtel, particularly by Darren Chau during his tenure as the Comedy Channel Group Programming Director, the programme could not be cleared for broadcast in Australia. Finally by 2012, the programme was cleared and launched in Australia on the Foxtel platform 16 July. It started to broadcast on ABC2 on 3 October 2013.
* ProSieben, a German network, aired &quot;Popclub&quot; between 2002 and 2003. Hosted by comedian Thomas Hermanns, the show&#x27;s major difference from &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; was the absence of constant team captains. Every episode featured two teams that had to present a name and a battle cry for themselves. Additionally, at the start of each episode, each member showed the very first record they ever bought.

==Merchandise==
===Books===
In 1999, BBC Worldwide published &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks: The Book, the CD, the Brief Intense Rush (followed by a feeling of paranoia and insecurity)&quot;. The book includes famous moments from the first five series of the show, from selected Identity Parades, I Fought the Law, Word Up and Connections rounds, along with collections of Mark Lamarr&#x27;s one-liners from the show. The book also features new material, including comic strips (one explaining the origin of The Human League frontman Philip Oakey&#x27;s hairstyle) and &quot;Great Moments in Rock History&quot;, in which photos of famous musical moments are altered to imply that line-up regular Athelston Williams was present. The CD features several Intros rounds from the show, in the format of a game to play at home.

===Board game===
In 2000, Paul Lamond Games released the &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; board game, licensed from the BBC and Talkback. The board game is played as follows: the players arrange themselves into two teams. They have two counters each on the board—one as a point marker along the edge of the board and the other to select the round they have to play on the roll of a die. There are six rounds that can be played:

* In the Style of..., where the team leader has to sing a song in the style of someone notable, e. g. &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot; in the style of Mick Jagger, or &quot;Start Me Up&quot; in the style of Jeremy Clarkson.
* When I Was Famous, where the team leader asks a trivia question, and the other team members have to guess the answer.
* Intros round, the only surviving round from the TV show. Each team gets two intro per round.
* Vital Vinyl, where the team leader asks a trivia question about a song or an album, and anyone from either team can answer.
* Songs in One Sentence, where the team leader divides their team into two, and one section of the team has to describe a song without mentioning the song title or any lyrics in the song, and the other section has to guess what the song is. This game was played once in the first series of the TV show.
* Your Number&#x27;s Up, where the team leader reads the category on the card to the opposite team, for example, &quot;name four songs that mention American states in their titles&quot;, for which you might answer &quot;New York Mining Disaster, 1941&quot; (Bee Gees), &quot;Hotel California&quot; (Eagles), &quot;Ohio&quot; (Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young), and &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (Lynyrd Skynyrd).

The teams earn the number of points given for the round on the card. For &quot;In the Style of…&quot;, it is always one point for the song, and two points for the artist they are doing the song in the style of. At the end of their turn, the team moves their counter on the outer ring clockwise, by the number of points they scored.

The team that overtakes the other on the squares on the edge of the board wins the game.

In 2015 Paul Lamond Games released an updated version of the board game.

===Video and DVD===
In 1998, a video titled &quot;Never Rewind the Buzzcocks&quot; was released, containing an episode of the show that was specially-recorded for the video.

A best of DVD including some of the unbroadcastable scenes from the Simon Amstell series was released on 16 November 2009. The DVD contains 3 specials including:

* Never Mind the Buzzcocks: Imagine... a mildly amusing panel show (a parody of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; series, with Alan Yentob acting as host)
* Never Mind the Buzzcocks – A Moving Tribute
* Never Mind the Buzzcocks – Technically, the Best Series Ever

The DVD also includes best of clips, and scenes that were not broadcast, with a compulsory commentary by Simon Amstell and Phill Jupitus.

<doc id="315115" wikidata="Q1516298" url="?curid=315115" title="Tulalip Tribes">
<text>The Tulalip Tribes of Washington (, ), formerly known as the Tulalip Tribes of the Tulalip Reservation, is a federally recognized tribe of Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish people. They are South and Central Coast Salish peoples of indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Their tribes are located in the mid-Puget Sound region of Washington.

Tulalip leader John McCoy was a member of the Washington State Legislature from 2003 to 2020. For a time he served as the only Native American in the legislature, at other times being joined by Jeff Morris, an Alaskan Native (Tsimpshian) who was elected in 1996 with two other Alaskan Natives, Dino Rossi (Tlingit) and Jim Dunn (Aleut). In 2002, the Tulalip Tribes also exerted political power by allying with other tribes across the state and defeating a state Supreme Court candidate &quot;with a long track record of opposing tribal interests.&quot;

==Name==

The term &quot;Tulalip&quot; (originally ) comes from the Snohomish dialect. It was used in 1855 to describe the tribes who joined on the Tulalip Reservation established by treaty with the federal government. They included the Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish peoples, all of whom are South and Central Coast Salish peoples.

==Reservation==

The Tulalip Indian Reservation was established by the Treaty of Point Elliot in 1855 and by Executive Order of US President Ulysses S. Grant on January 22, 1873. The reservation lies on Port Susan in western Snohomish County, adjacent to the western border of the city of Marysville. It has a land area of and a 2020 census population of 10,969 persons residing within its boundaries. The reservation&#x27;s largest community is Tulalip Bay.

The Tulalip people settled onto reservation lands after signing the Point Elliott Treaty with the former Washington Territory on January 22, 1855. The reservation was intended to serve most of the tribes in the Puget Sound region, but plans were scaled back after additional reservations were added. The Tulalip Indian Reservation now comprises the western half of the Marysville–Tulalip community, which was divided by the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1950s and 1960s. Marysville is an incorporated city and lies east of the freeway. A section of the reservation was home to a federal ammunition depot established during World War II and later used by Boeing for chemical weapons testing and storage.

The Marysville School District serves both the city and the reservation. To accommodate a growing population, in 2008 it opened three new schools, built of prefabricated, modular units that operate and look like traditional construction, at its site on the reservation. This large campus is now called the Marysville Secondary Campus; it contains Heritage High School, Marysville Arts and Technology High School, and an elementary school. The two high schools share a gym and commons center. In 2022, the Tulalip Tribes announced plans to build their own elementary school that would use an alternative, indigenous-focused education model that had been trialed at Heritage High School.

==Economy==
The tribe has developed Quil Ceda Village as a municipality within the reservation. It also developed a business park to provide jobs and tax income for the tribe, and to diversify its economy. Situated alongside Interstate 5, the business park includes the tribe&#x27;s first gaming casino, Quil Ceda Creek Casino; the second, the $72 million Tulalip Resort Casino, and a $130 million associated 12-story luxury hotel.

Retail businesses include Walmart and Home Depot. In 2004, the tribe signed a deal with Chelsea Property Group to develop an outlet mall on the reservation. The company agreed to develop 100 to 120 stores on 47 acres of land near the tribe&#x27;s casino and the Quil Ceda Business Park. The contract is expected to yield $1.2 million annually in revenues for the tribe. The deal runs for 75 years. The outlet mall, Seattle Premium Outlet, opened in 2005; a variety of restaurants have also opened.
In August 2011, the tribe opened the on the reservation. The center includes museum exhibits of Tulalip history and artifacts, classrooms, an archaeological repository, a longhouse, and research library. Attached is a nature preserve.

==Government==

The Tulalip Tribes are headquartered in Tulalip, Washington. The tribe is governed by a seven-member, democratically elected Board of Directors, whose members fill designated roles as officers. Directors are elected to serve three year terms. The current tribal administration is as follows:

* Chairwoman: Teri Gobin
* Vice Chairwoman: Misty Napeahi
* Secretary: Theresa Sheldon
* Treasurer: Hazen Shopbell
* Council member: Glen Gobin
* Council member: Marlin Fryberg Jr.
* Council member: Debra Posey 

The Tulalip Tribes has defined its rules for membership in the tribe. Membership is based on January 1, 1935, Tulalip census roll; new applicants must prove descent from persons on that roll and that their parents were residents of the Tulalip Reservation at the time of the individual&#x27;s birth. It does not require a minimum blood quantum.

==Judicial system: Pilot project of VAWA 2013==

The US Supreme Court&#x27;s majority opinion in &quot;Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe&quot; (1978) affirmed that tribal courts were not allowed to have jurisdiction over a non-Indian person in a criminal case on the reservation. Through the passage of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013), signed into law on March 7, 2013, by President Barack Obama, tribal courts have been authorized to exercise special criminal jurisdiction over certain crimes of domestic and dating violence.

This new law generally took effect on March 7, 2015. It also authorized a voluntary &quot;Pilot Project&quot; to allow certain tribes to begin exercising special jurisdiction beginning February 20, 2014. Three tribes were selected for this Pilot Project: the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (Oregon), the Pascua Yaqui Tribe (Arizona), and the Tulalip Tribes of Washington.

==Language==
The tribes speak English and Lushootseed, a Central Salish language. The language is written in the Latin script. A dictionary and grammar have been published. The tribe established its own language department in the 1990s to promote and preserve the use of Lushootseed across the region. Marysville Pilchuck High School began offering Lushootseed classes to its students in 2019.

==Economic development==

The Tulalip Tribes own and operate Tulalip Bingo, Quil Ceda Deli, Canoes Carvery, Cedars Cafe, Eagles Buffet, Tulalip Bay Restaurant, Journeys East, The Draft Sports Bar &amp; Grill, Tulalip Resort Casino, Quil Ceda Creek Nightclub and Casino, Torch Grill, and Q Burgers, all located in Tulalip, Washington. With revenues generated by their successful casinos, they have invested and developed other businesses to diversify their economy.

The tribe began development of a major shopping and business center along Interstate 5 in the 1990s, aiming to attract the auxiliary support facility of Naval Station Everett as its main tenant, but an agreement broke down. The center, named Quil Ceda Village, was built in the early 2000s alongside a new casino and outlet mall. The tribe&#x27;s original casino was renamed to Quil Ceda Creek Casino and was replaced by a new, building in 2021.

The tribe also operates two gas stations that opened in 2009 and 2011 with discounts for tribal members. The gas stations were originally supplied by Chevron, but switched to a Yakama Nation-owned distributor in 2022.

The Tulalip Tribes owns a disused railroad bridge over Interstate 5 at the north end of Quil Ceda Village that had been used by Boeing for access to its engine test site on the reservation. The tribe has long-term plans to use the bridge for a multi-use pedestrian and bicycling trail that would connect to a proposed Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; station in Marysville.

==Politics==

The Tulalip Tribes has begun to act more in local and state politics, at times in alliance with other Native American tribes in the state. In November 2002, John McCoy, a longtime Tulalip leader, was elected to the Washington state legislature, where he first served as the only Native American member.

In addition, in the 2002 election, the Tulalip worked with other tribes in the state to defeat a candidate for the state Supreme Court who had a long record of opposing tribal interests.

Seven other Native Americans have since been elected to the state legislature, including Julie Johnson (Lummi). Only one Native American state representative is Republican; all the others are members of the Democratic Party.

==Events==
The tribes host numerous annual events, including Treaty Days, typically in January to commemorate the signing of the Point Elliot Treaty on January 22, 1855; First King Salmon Ceremony, to bless the fishermen and celebrate catching the first king salmon of the season; Winter Dancing; and a Veteran&#x27;s Pow Wow during the first weekend of every June.

<doc id="315118" wikidata="Q5467899" url="?curid=315118" title="Ford Parklane">
<text>The Ford Parklane is a station wagon that was produced by Ford for the 1956 model year. In line with the Chevrolet Nomad, the Parklane was a premium two-door station wagon, combining the body of the two-door Ford Ranch Wagon with trim elements of the Ford Fairlane sedan. 

For the 1957 model year, the Parklane was succeeded by the Ford Del Rio; similar in concept to the Parklane, the Del Rio was added to the Ranch Wagon model line. The nameplate returned (as two words) for 1958 in the Mercury division, denoting its premium sedan line; the Mercury Park Lane was produced through the end of the 1960s. 

==Model overview==
The Parklane is a two-door station wagon, sharing its bodyshell with the Ford Ranch Wagon. To distinguish the model line, the Parklane received the stainless-steel bodyside stripe of the Fairlane (otherwise reserved for three-row Country Sedans). While the roofline was shared directly with the Ranch Wagon, the B-pillar was trimmed in stainless steel (a design element loosely adapted from the Fairlane Crown Victoria).

The model line introduced several advanced features for the time, including a fully-carpeted interior (including the cargo area) and a privacy cover for the cargo area. As a $60 option, the Park Lane was offered with 4-way front power seats. In line with other Ford station wagons, the rear seat of the Park Lane folded completely flat, forming a single flat load surface. 

The Parklane shared its powertrain offerings with other Ford station wagons. A 223 cubic-inch inline-6 was the standard engine, with a 292 cubic-inch V8 (shared with the Thunderbird) was offered as an option. The 11-inch drum brakes introduced for 1955 were fitted to the model line. 

== Epilogue ==
Although a 1957 Parklane prototype was assembled, Ford withdrew the model line after a single model year. Coinciding with the release of the 1957 Ford model family, Ford repackaged the Parklane as the Ford Del Rio. While similar in concept, the Del Rio was more closely integrated within the Ranch Wagon model range. 

As the 1950s progressed, two-door station wagons began to fall out of favor; though offering the same passenger capacity as a four-door wagon, two-door station wagons restricted rear-seat passenger access. Purchased primarily for utilitarian use, the market segment of two-door station wagons saw little demand for high-feature vehicles (which appealed to families).

While more widely recognized than the Parklane (in part from its concept-car derived design), the Chevrolet Nomad was outsold by the Parklane by nearly two-to-one: 15,186 Parklanes were produced in comparison to 7,886 1956 Nomads.

<doc id="315119" wikidata="Q1970425" url="?curid=315119" title="Virtua Cop">
<text>is a 1994 light gun shooter video game developed and published by Sega for arcades. It was developed for the Sega Model 2 system, and was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995 and Windows as &quot;Virtua Squad&quot; in 1996. The Saturn version included support for both the Virtua Gun and Saturn mouse, as well as a new &quot;Training Mode&quot; which consists of a randomly generated shooting gallery.

&quot;Virtua Cop&quot; was notable for its use of real-time 3D polygon graphics with texture mapping, with Sega advertising it as &quot;the world&#x27;s first texture mapped, polygon action game&quot;. Emphasizing the real-time nature of the game, enemies would react differently depending on where they were shot. It was one of the first games to allow the player to shoot through glass. Its name is derived from its 3D graphical style, which was previously used in &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;, and later &quot;Virtua Striker&quot;.

Despite some initial skepticism over its introduction of 3D polygons in a genre that previously used realistic digitized sprites (most notably &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot;), &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; went on to become a commercial success and received critical acclaim for enhancing the genre with its 3D graphics, camera system, realistic animations, and ability to target specific body parts with realistic consequences. It was influential on later shooter games, with 3D polygons being adopted by subsequent light gun shooters such as &quot;Time Crisis&quot; (1995) and &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; (1996) instead of the digitized sprites previously used in the genre, as well as inspiring the first-person shooter &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997).

&quot;Virtua Cop&quot; was followed by &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot; and &quot;Virtua Cop 3&quot;. The game was later bundled with &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot; in Japan and Europe on the PlayStation 2 as &quot;Virtua Cop: Elite Edition&quot; (&quot;Virtua Cop Rebirth&quot; in Japan) on August 25 and November 29, 2002 respectively. It included gallery extras and implementation of Namco&#x27;s G-Con 2 lightgun support. In 2004, a port was developed for the handheld Nokia N-Gage, but was cancelled by the quality control team before its release. Very few beta units of the N-Gage version were manufactured.

==Gameplay==
Players assume the role of police officers - either Michael Hardy, or his partner, James Cools. Played in a first-person perspective, players must use a light gun (or a joypad in the Sega Saturn version) to shoot criminals and advance through the game. Players begin the game with a reloadable chamber of six bullets and a set number of lives. Taking enemy fire causes the player to lose a life; power-ups can be shot to grant the player a special weapon or even an extra life. There are also civilians that the player must not harm during the stage. If the player hits a civilian, the player loses a life. The special weapon will be lost if the player takes damage, but not if he shoots a civilian. Players can score extra points for &quot;justice shots&quot; (disarming an enemy without killing them, done by shooting their hand) and &quot;bullseyes&quot; (shooting the center of the target circle).

==Story==
A detective in the player&#x27;s department uncovers an illegal gunrunning operation and traces it back to a powerful crime syndicate named E.V.I.L. Inc. He compiles a large amount of evidence and is ready to take them down, but he is discovered and assassinated. Some of the evidence manages to make its way back to headquarters and a special task force is put on the case. The policemen Michael &quot;Rage&quot; Hardy and James &quot;Smarty&quot; Cools must face that organization led by Joe Fang and his followers Kong, the King, and the Boss.

==Development==
Katsunori Itai and Akihito Hiroyoshi served as the lead developers on &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, with Yu Suzuki serving as supervisor. The game&#x27;s targeting reticles and zooming camera were inspired by a commercial for Pokka Kilimanjaro coffee. Kenneth Ibrahim, who voiced the navigator in &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, voiced the civilians.

A division of Sega AM2 began work on the Saturn version in April 1995. Along with the Saturn version of &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;, it was one of the first games to make use of the Sega Graphics Library operating system. Saturn port director Takashi Isono said: &quot;We are trying to keep to the quality of the arcade. If three of us agree for improvement, then we try to modify the graphics&quot;. The Saturn version features a full-motion video sequence of Michael and James driving on the dockyard before confronting Kong; designer Kazufumi Ohashi originally animated Kong flipping the bird, which Isono rejected, moving Ohashi to work on the training mode instead.

In June, the team displayed a playable demo of the Saturn version&#x27;s first level at the Tokyo Toy Show. They subsequently began work on the third level, since it was the most difficult to convert due to the large polygon areas of the office building walls and ceiling.

==In other games==
*&quot;Sega Superstars Tennis&quot; features a minigame based on &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; called &quot;Virtua Squad&quot;.
*The default gun, the Guardian, can be used in &quot;Ghost Squad&quot;; however, it can only be obtained by playing the IC Card or &quot;Evolution&quot; versions.
*Tiger Electronics made a version of &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; for the R-Zone.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their November 1, 1994 issue as being the second most-successful upright/cockpit arcade cabinet of the month. In North America, &quot;RePlay&quot; reported &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; to be the fifth most-popular arcade game in April 1995. It went on to become the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1995 in Japan, and one of America&#x27;s top ten best-selling arcade video games of 1995.

The arcade game received generally positive reviews from critics. Tim Davis of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a positive review, praising the polygon graphics, the zooming camera &quot;that takes you all over&quot; the place, the &quot;automatic target sighting which pinpoints&quot; enemies, and the weapon power-ups. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; also gave it a positive review, calling it &quot;a classy title&quot; and praising the 3D graphics, &quot;excellent&quot; animation, weapon power-ups, and the gameplay in both single-player and multiplayer modes. &quot;Games World&quot; magazine called it an &quot;excellent fun&quot; game, comparing it favorably with the shooters &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; (1987) and &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot; (1992) as well as the film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), while Dave Perry said the &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; like 3D targets made it a &quot;more challenging and satisfying&quot; shooter.

There was initially some skepticism over its introduction of 3D polygons in a genre that previously used realistic digitized sprites, most notably Konami&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; initially gave &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; a mixed review in 1994, stating that Sega were &quot;recklessly applying new technology to games that don&#x27;t need it&quot; but that &quot;if players were given a chance to freely explore their mapped-out environments, this game would be a winner, but as it is, &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; is just an old game with a new gimmick&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; later revised their views, praising its use of 3D technology to introduce the ability to target specific body parts with realistic consequences, which &quot;totally eliminates the hit or miss polarity of other light-gun games and adds a whole new level of detail to the genre&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; series (which then consisted of just &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; and the arcade version of &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot;) at number 82 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, praising the skill and realism invoked by the enemies&#x27; differing reactions to being shot in different places.

===Saturn===
Upon release of the Saturn version, the game sold over 300,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan. Its Japanese sales reached 455,396 units by the end of 1995, and 482,362 units in total. In the United States, it sold more than 500,000 bundled copies by December 1996, bringing total sales to more than copies sold in Japan and the United States.

The Saturn version received positive reviews from critics. &quot;Next Generation&quot; gave it a positive review, applauding the impeccable accuracy of the port, but opted not to give it the full five stars they awarded to the Saturn&#x27;s other two arcade ports of that month (&quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; and &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;), as they found that the game, while sufficiently long for an arcade game, was too short for a home console release. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Reiner, Andy, and Paul gave the Saturn version scores of 8.5, 8.25 and 7.5 out of 10, praising the game as one of the best in its genre but noting that it lacked longevity for a console release.

Rad Automatic of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; said of the Saturn version: &quot;It&#x27;s got more depth than you&#x27;d imagine but is still mindless enough to be frenetically playable.&quot; He praised the effectiveness of the joypad control with its two cursor movement speeds, the authentic arcade feel when playing with two Virtua Guns, and the realism compared to other light gun games: &quot;You don&#x27;t see thousands of enemies popping up from behind exactly the same barrel ... In fact, you won&#x27;t see enemies popping up from barrels at all that much, as your foes arrive on screen in far more interesting ways&quot;.

All four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised it as a flawless conversion of the arcade game, though half of them also remarked that they felt the game itself is too short and lacks lasting appeal. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the realistic and stylish graphics and the Virtua Gun action. Similarly to EGM&#x27;s reviewers, he remarked that the game is a near-perfect arcade port but too short and completely lacking in replay value, though he nonetheless gave it an overall recommendation. &quot;Maximum&quot; instead argued that the game is compelling enough to be played over and over again despite the lack of replay value. They also described the Saturn conversion as nearly identical to the arcade original, and remarked that the mindlessness and simplicity of the game make it particularly enjoyable.

&quot;Game Players&quot; gave the Saturn version of &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; the award for &quot;Best Shooter&quot; of 1995, calling it &quot;beyond entertaining — it&#x27;s therapeutic.&quot; In 1996, GamesMaster rated the Saturn version 4th on their &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10.&quot;

===PC===
Time Soete of GameSpot said the PC version is jerkier than the Saturn version and less intense without the use of a light gun, but that the mouse control is surprisingly smooth and that it retains enough of the fun of the arcade and Saturn versions to appeal to newcomers to the game. &quot;Next Generation&quot; voiced similar criticisms: &quot;It&#x27;s noticeably slower on the majority of PCs than in the arcade or on Saturn, running at speed only on the most high-end Pentiums. Worse, played without a light gun using only the mouse, the game loses a major part of its appeal...&quot; They concluded that the game felt out of place on PC.

==Legacy==
&quot;Virtua Cop&quot; was a major influence on both light gun shooters as well as first-person shooters. When it was released in 1994, the game broke new ground by introducing the use of 3D polygons to the shooter genre. Some of the popular light gun rail shooters influenced by &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; include the &quot;Time Crisis&quot; series, &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; series, various &quot;Resident Evil&quot; spin-offs, and &quot;Dead Space: Extraction&quot;.

&quot;Virtua Cop&quot; was also the primary influence on the seminal first-person shooter &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, which was originally envisioned as an on-rails light gun shooter akin to &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; before it ended up as an off-rails first-person shooter. According to creator Martin Hollis: &quot;We ended up with innovative gameplay, in part because we had &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; features in a FPS: A gun that only holds 7 bullets and a reload button, lots of position-dependent hit animations, innocents you shouldn’t kill, and an aiming mode. When you press R in &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, the game basically switches to a &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; mode. Perhaps more importantly following the lead from &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, the game was filled with action. There was lots to do, with very few pauses&quot;.

<doc id="315122" wikidata="Q1851314" url="?curid=315122" title="Sartoris">
<text>Sartoris is a novel, first published in 1929, by the American author William Faulkner. It portrays the decay of the Mississippi aristocracy following the social upheaval of the American Civil War. The 1929 edition is an abridged version of Faulkner&#x27;s original work. The full text was published in 1973 as &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;. Faulkner&#x27;s great-grandfather William Clark Falkner, himself a colonel in the American Civil War, served as the model for Colonel John Sartoris. Faulkner also fashioned other characters in the book on
local people from his hometown Oxford. His friend Ben Wasson was the model for Horace Benbow, while Faulkner&#x27;s brother Murry served as the antetype for young Bayard Sartoris.

== Synopsis ==
The novel deals with the decay of an aristocratic southern family just after the end of World War I. The wealthy Sartoris family of Jefferson, Mississippi, lives under the shadow of its dead patriarch, Colonel John Sartoris. Colonel John was a Confederate cavalry officer during the Civil War, built the local railroad, and is a folk hero. The surviving Sartorises are his younger sister, Virginia Du Pre (&quot;Aunt Jenny&quot; or &quot;Miss Jenny&quot;), his son Bayard Sartoris (&quot;Old Bayard&quot;), and his great-grandson Bayard Sartoris (&quot;Young Bayard&quot;).

The novel begins with the return of young Bayard Sartoris to Jefferson from the First World War. Bayard and his twin brother John, who was killed in action, were fighter pilots.

Young Bayard is haunted by the death of his brother. That and the family disposition for foolhardy acts push him into a pattern of self-destructive behavior, especially reckless driving in a recently purchased automobile.

Eventually young Bayard crashes the car off a bridge. During the convalescence which follows, he establishes a relationship with Narcissa Benbow, whom he marries. Despite promises to Narcissa to stop driving recklessly, he gets into a near wreck with old Bayard in the car, causing old Bayard to die of a heart attack. Young Bayard disappears from Jefferson, leaving his now pregnant wife with Aunt Jenny. He dies test-flying an experimental airplane on the day of his son’s birth.

==Background==
In late 1926, William Faulkner, aged 29, began work on the first of his novels about Yoknapatawpha County. Sherwood Anderson had told him some time before that he should write about his native Mississippi, and now Faulkner took that advice: he used his own land, and peopled it with men and women who were partly drawn from real life, and partly depicted as they should have been in some ideal mythopoeic structure. A year later, on September 29, 1927, the new novel was completed. It was 596 pages long in transcript, and he called it &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;. Full of enthusiasm, Faulkner sent Flags in the Dust up to Horace Liveright (who had published his first two novels) in New York. Liveright read it, disliked it, and sent it back with his firm recommendation that Faulkner not try to offer it for publication anywhere else: it was too diffuse, too lacking in plot and structure; and, Liveright felt, no amount of revision would be able to salvage it. Faulkner, crushed, showed &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot; to several of his friends, who shared Liveright&#x27;s opinion.

Despite the adversity Faulkner had faced, he still believed that this would be the book that would make his name as a writer, and for several months he tried to edit it himself, sitting at his worktable in Oxford. Finally, discouraged, he sent a new typescript off to Ben Wasson, his agent in New York. &quot;Will you please try to sell this for me?&quot; he asked Wasson. &quot;I can&#x27;t afford all the postage it&#x27;s costing me.&quot; In the meantime, convinced that he would never become a successful novelist, Faulkner began to work on a book that he was sure would never mean anything to anyone but himself: &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;.

Wasson tried eleven publishers, all of whom rejected &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;. Finally he gave the typescript to Harrison Smith, then an editor of Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company. Smith liked it, and showed it to Alfred Harcourt, who agreed to publish it, provided that someone other than Faulkner perform the extensive cutting job that Harcourt felt was necessary. For fifty dollars, Wasson agreed to pare down his client&#x27;s novel. On September 20, 1928, Faulkner received a contract for the book, now to be called &quot;Sartoris&quot; (no one knows who changed its name), which was to be about 110,000 words long, and which was to be delivered to Harcourt, Brace sixteen days later. Faulkner left immediately for New York, presumably to help Wasson with his revision. But when he sat down in Wasson&#x27;s apartment to observe the operation on his novel, Faulkner found himself unable to participate. If it were cut, he felt, it would die. Wasson persisted, however, pointing out that the trouble with &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot; was that it was not one novel, but six, all struggling along simultaneously. This, to Faulkner, was praise: evidence of fecundity and fullness of vision, evidence that the world of Yoknapatawpha was rich enough to last. As he later wrote of his third novel, &quot;I discovered that my own little postage stamp of native soil was worth writing about and that I would never live long enough to exhaust it.&quot; Nevertheless, Wasson kept his bargain with Alfred Harcourt. For the next two weeks, while Faulkner sat nearby writing &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, Wasson went through the typescript of &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot;, making cuts of every sort until almost a fourth of the book had been excised. Harcourt, Brace published this truncated version on January 31, 1929, as &quot;Sartoris&quot; (with a dedication: &quot;To Sherwood Anderson through whose kindness I was first published, with a belief that this book will give him no reason to regret that fact&quot;), and the old &quot;Flags in the Dust&quot; was soon forgotten by everyone but Faulkner.

== Literary importance ==
&quot;Sartoris&quot; is the first of Faulkner’s tales set in Yoknapatawpha County, and introduces many of the characters that appear in his later fiction. It was also the immediate predecessor of some of his most famous and critically acclaimed novels &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;,&quot; As I Lay Dying&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Light in August&quot;.

The novel also introduces Byron Snopes in a minor role as a rival suitor to Narcissa Benbow. His relative Flem Snopes is at the center of Faulkner’s &quot;Snopes trilogy&quot;: &quot;The Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Town&quot; and &quot;The Mansion&quot;.

In a letter to his publisher, Faulkner said &quot;At last and certainly, I have written THE book, of which those other things were but foals. I believe it is the damdest best book you&#x27;ll look at this year, and any other publisher&quot;.

Contemporary reviews, however, were mixed; while appreciating Faulkner&#x27;s writing style, they stressed the book&#x27;s seeming lack of consistency and its loose plot. Literary critic Cleanth Brooks described the novel as &quot;extremely well-written&quot;, full of literary allusions and exploring the plight of a lost generation. He compared &quot;Sartoris&quot; to the poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; by T. S. Eliot.

<text>King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink station is a closed railway station in central London, England. It is located on Pentonville Road, around east of King&#x27;s Cross mainline station. At the time of closure, in 2007, it was served by Thameslink trains and managed by First Capital Connect. Services have been transferred to a new station underneath St Pancras.

The station opened in 1863 as King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan. It was one of the initial seven stations on the Metropolitan Railway, London&#x27;s first underground line, which ran between Paddington and Farringdon. The Metropolitan had been planning for the station since 1851, when King&#x27;s Cross mainline station was constructed, to provide a connection between the Great Western Railway at Paddington and the Great Northern Railway (GNR) out of King&#x27;s Cross. Within a year of the new station&#x27;s opening, a pair of tunnels was added, which surfaced on the GNR just north of King&#x27;s Cross and provided a direct rail connection between the two lines. In 1866 the line was extended east to Moorgate and Snow Hill tunnel was built to join the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) City Branch at Ludgate Hill. In 1868 a second pair of tracks, known as the City Widened Lines, was opened along with a tunnel connection to the Midland Railway near St Pancras station. The route through the station was very busy throughout the remainder of the century, carrying trains from five companies. In 1892 the station was linked to the concourse of King&#x27;s Cross mainline station by a foot tunnel.

The opening of the Piccadilly and Northern underground lines, as well as the growth of trams on the surface streets, led to a sharp reduction of services on the City Widened Lines in the early twentieth century. The Metropolitan line remained popular, however, following electrification of its tracks in 1905–06. Passenger service was reduced to peak hours only during World War I, with no service through the Snow Hill tunnel, as the lines were used heavily for freight and troop movements. The line and station were closed for five months during World War II, following damage in The Blitz. Only the City Widened Lines platforms remained in use when the station reopened in 1941: the Metropolitan line station was moved to a new pair of platforms which had been built at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station, providing a shorter connection to the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Trains from the East Coast Main Line and Midland Main Line continued to stop at King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan. In the 1980s the City Widened Lines were electrified and the Snow Hill tunnel reopened to passenger traffic as part of the Thameslink programme. The station was renamed, first to King&#x27;s Cross Midland City and then to its final name, King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink. Service on the line grew and new destinations were added, and by the 2000s the station could no longer handle the passenger numbers. A new pair of platforms were built at St Pancras, and King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink closed in 2007. The station was included in the London station group from the group&#x27;s inception in 1983, and remained so until its closure.

== Naming ==
The station was officially known as King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan when it opened by the Metropolitan Railway in 1863, although on timetables and maps it was often just called King&#x27;s Cross or King&#x27;s Cross (Met.). The Metropolitan line part of the station was renamed to King&#x27;s Cross &amp; St Pancras in 1925 and then to King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras in 1933, when the Metropolitan Railway was merged with the Underground Electric Railways Company of London to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The station was then part of the King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station complex. The City Widened Lines platforms continued to be signed as King&#x27;s Cross through to the 1970s. When the station reopened in 1983, following electrification, it was known as King&#x27;s Cross Midland City and acquired its final name, King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink, in 1988.

== Location and layout ==
King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink is located in a cutting around east of King&#x27;s Cross mainline station. The station&#x27;s main entrance was on the north side of the station at the western end of Pentonville Road, part of the London Inner Ring Road. This replaced an earlier entrance located on Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, south of the tracks. The Thameslink platforms were linked directly by stairs and a tunnel to the Victoria and Piccadilly line platforms at King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, and via both sets of platforms to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and Northern lines as well as the mainline stations at King&#x27;s Cross and St Pancras.

The station had four platforms. The two to the south were for the Metropolitan line, and were used from 1863 to 1940. The two northern platforms, used from 1863 to 1979 and from 1983 to 2007, served the City Widened Lines and later the Thameslink service. The southbound Metropolitan and northbound Widened shared an island platform. After closure of the Metropolitan platforms a high wall was built on that island. The two platforms in use during the King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink era were lettered rather than numbered, to avoid confusion with the platforms at nearby King&#x27;s Cross among staff who worked at both stations.

In 1983, British Rail introduced the London station group, a group of stations in central London which were regarded as a single destination for ticketing and fare purposes. King&#x27;s Cross Midland City, as it was then called, was one of the original eighteen stations in the group, and it retained this status until closure in 2007.

== History ==

===Early history===

The area of King&#x27;s Cross was previously a village known as Battle Bridge, an ancient crossing of the River Fleet. The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. The mainline King&#x27;s Cross station was built in 1851–52 as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed. The station took its name from the King&#x27;s Cross building, a monument to King George IV that stood in the area and was demolished in 1845. Plans for the station were made in December 1848 under the direction of George Turnbull, resident engineer for constructing the first of the Great Northern Railway out of London. The station opened on 14 October 1852. The first suburban services to and from King&#x27;s Cross began operating in 1861, initially to Seven Sisters Road station (which was renamed to Finsbury Park in 1869), and later to Hornsey and beyond.

===King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan===

The first underground station at King&#x27;s Cross was planned in 1851, during construction of the mainline station. The intention was to connect the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Paddington with the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at King&#x27;s Cross. The line was opened on 10 January 1863, along with six other stations, as part of the original section of the Metropolitan Railway, which would later become part of the London Underground. King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan, the predecessor of King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink, opened at the same time and was located to the east of the mainline station. The line was initially dual gauge, enabling both the GWR&#x27;s broad gauge trains and other standard gauge stock to run. Later that year a pair of tunnels—the York Road Curve for southbound trains and the Hotel Curve for northbound trains—were built, joining the GNR lines north of King&#x27;s Cross mainline with the Metropolitan&#x27;s line at King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan. The GWR ran the first trains on the line, but relations towards the Metropolitan quickly became strained and the GWR withdrew from the route in August 1863. The Metropolitan was able to continue operating by leasing rolling stock from the GNR, which it brought on to the line through the York Road tunnel. The GNR started routing all its suburban trains through the tunnels to Farringdon Street (now Farringdon) station in October. Trains into London stopped at a new platform known as King&#x27;s Cross York Road to the north east of the mainline station, and again at the Metropolitan station, while trains out of London stopped at the Metropolitan station, and again at the mainline station, by reversing into a platform after exiting the Hotel Curve.

In 1866 the Snow Hill tunnel was opened, joining the Metropolitan Railway at Farringdon Street to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) terminus at Ludgate Hill. This allowed goods and passenger trains to run from the GNR lines south through to Herne Hill and beyond. The lines became very congested, leading to the opening in 1868 of a new pair of lines known as the City Widened Lines. These ran alongside the original tracks from King&#x27;s Cross through to Moorgate, and allowed GNR and Metropolitan traffic to run along the line simultaneously. The same year the Metropolitan built a pair of tunnels to the Midland Railway tracks north of its new terminus at St Pancras station. This enabled the Midland to begin running a service from Bedford through to Moorgate. The Midland tunnels as well as the original York Road and Hotel Curve tunnels from King&#x27;s Cross mainline station were connected to the City Widened Lines, while the link to the original Metropolitan lines was removed. The original Metropolitan tracks became part of the Inner Circle (later known as the Circle line), which ran partly on Metropolitan tracks and partly on District Railway tracks. The line was completed in 1884. Services were provided by both the Metropolitan, which ran the clockwise trains and the District, which ran anticlockwise.

The route through King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan remained busy throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century, with trains from five companies—the Metropolitan, GNR, Midland, LCDR and the South Eastern Railway (SER)—and routes including Victoria to Peterborough as well as services from north London to Chatham and Dover. A service operated from Liverpool to Paris via the Widened Lines, departing at 08:00 and arriving in Paris by 22:50, having travelled by across the English Channel in a paddle steamer. Trains continued to ascend up the Hotel Curve from the Metropolitan station and reverse into the mainline station until 1878, when a new platform was built on the western side of the GNR tracks. This became known as the King&#x27;s Cross Suburban station, but suffered from several problems including a steep incline and sharp curve, along with a build-up of smoke because of its proximity to the mouth of the tunnel. Congestion was somewhat alleviated when a connection between Finsbury Park and Canonbury allowed use of the North London Railway tracks to take some of the traffic from the GNR lines into Broad Street station in the City of London rather than down the Metropolitan line. In 1892 the station was linked to the concourse of the mainline station by a foot tunnel.

=== Arrival of the deep tube and relocation of Metropolitan platforms ===
The advent of deep-level tube lines at the turn of the twentieth century caused major changes in the underground network. The Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway, later known as the Piccadilly line, opened a station serving King&#x27;s Cross and St Pancras in 1906, and the City &amp; South London Railway, now part of the Northern line, opened its station the following year. The tube platforms were linked to King&#x27;s Cross Metropolitan through the same foot tunnel as the mainline, making one station complex. The Metropolitan line part of the station was amalgamated in 1933 with the deep-level lines as part of the newly-formed the LPTB. The arrival of the Piccadilly and Northern lines, as well as the growth of trams on the surface streets, led to a sharp reduction of services on the City Widened Lines. The SER, LCDR, and GNR services were withdrawn in 1907, and the Midland and LC&amp;DR joint service in June the following year. The decreased passenger service allowed a growth in freight traffic through the station. During World War I the line was used for freight and troop movements with 250,000 tons of freight and 26,047 special troop trains passing through. Passenger service was reduced to four hours per day during morning and evening peak hours from 1915. The Snow Hill tunnel closed to passenger service during the war, and the north–south link was used only by freight in the postwar years. Service on the Circle and Metropolitan line tracks increased over subsequent years, however, following electrification of those tracks in 1905–06.

The infrastructure around King&#x27;s Cross was bombed by Germany in 1940 during the Blitz early in World War II. The Circle line between Euston Square and King&#x27;s Cross was particularly damaged and services stopped completely for five months. When the line reopened in March 1941 a new pair of platforms were opened to the west, making use of abandoned tunnels from the 1860s and providing a shorter connection to the Piccadilly and Northern lines. This scheme, part of what is now Kings Cross St Pancras tube station, had been planned by the MR since 1935. The original platforms were abandoned but are still in place and visible from passing trains as of 2019. After the war, national rail services continued to use the City Widened Lines platforms of the original station from the GNR route (now known as the East Coast Main Line) and from the Midland Mainline.

=== Thameslink programme ===
The Snow Hill tunnel, which had seen no passenger services since 1916, closed completely on 24 March 1969 with the withdrawal of freight services; the tracks were lifted in May 1971. Services from the East Coast line then ended in 1976 after the Northern City Line was transferred from London Underground control to British Rail, allowing services to run from Finsbury Park directly to Moorgate avoiding King&#x27;s Cross. A handful of services from the Midland line continued to run, but the Widened Lines were almost unused in the late 1970s.

In 1979 an £80 million project was launched to electrify the Midland Mainline from Bedford to St Pancras and the City Widened Lines. The station was closed, along with the line, and work was completed by May 1982. The tracks were lowered to allow for overhead power cables to be installed and several bridges were remodelled. Despite completion of the line and availability of rolling stock by early 1983, the opening of the line was delayed over a dispute with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) union regarding driver-only operation on the new electric trains. The station eventually reopened later in 1983, with the new name of King&#x27;s Cross Midland City. Trains ran between Bedford and Moorgate, via St Pancras and the tunnels from the Midland mainline to the City Widened Lines.

In 1988 Network SouthEast, one of the newly created sectors of the state-owned British Rail, implemented a scheme first proposed in the 1960s to reopen the Snow Hill tunnel to passenger traffic. The project, and the new north–south connection created, was called Thameslink. Trains ran between Bedford and Brighton using Class 319 dual-voltage trains which could run on both the Midland Mainline&#x27;s overhead AC system and the Brighton Mainline&#x27;s third-rail system. Five years after its previous rename, the station at King&#x27;s Cross was once again renamed, this time to King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink. Services on the line grew and new stations were added, including a station at the southern end of the Snow Hill tunnel named City Thameslink, which replaced the earlier terminal Holborn Viaduct station which was not on the through route.

At around the time Thameslink was launched, British Rail began active planning for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, a new high-speed line to link London with the Channel tunnel. The initial proposal was for the line to end at a new &quot;King&#x27;s Cross Low Level&quot; station, which would run from north west to south east underneath the Great Northern Hotel and the mainline terminal, and would become a joint station for Eurostar and Thameslink services. This plan was developed in some detail by architect Norman Foster, but was ultimately vetoed by the government in 1990 due to high costs. The project, which became known as High Speed 1, was eventually completed in 2007 with terminal platforms at St Pancras rather than King&#x27;s Cross.

===Closure and relocation===

In the mid-2000s, Network Rail began work on the Thameslink Programme, a scheme originally proposed in around 1990 but delayed several times. The plan involved increasing the service frequency between King&#x27;s Cross and Blackfriars to 24 trains per hour. Planners for the programme decided that the existing King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink station would be unable to cope with this increase. They criticised its substandard platform widths and lengths, lack of step-free access and fire escape routes, as well as the poor-quality passenger environment. They decided to move the station rather than upgrade it at its existing location. The surrounding infrastructure made this impractical and it would also have caused serious disruption to the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan Underground lines as well as nearby roads. The siting of the High Speed 1 terminus under St Pancras rather than King&#x27;s Cross also meant that the Thameslink platforms were a long distance by foot from the planned Eurostar platforms.

Network Rail initially considered reusing the abandoned Norman Foster proposal, which had called for a combined Eurostar and Thameslink station underneath King&#x27;s Cross mainline station, but updated to be for Thameslink only. This would have the advantage of fewer closures to the line during construction, as the site was not on the existing line. Ultimately though, due to the cost of relocating the lines and the political issues with demolishing the Grade-II-listed Great Northern Hotel, Network Rail decided to build the new platforms on the existing alignment, under the St Pancras complex. The new platforms are close to the High Speed 1 platforms used by Eurostar trains, and provide an easier connection to the mainline stations at St Pancras and King&#x27;s Cross. The work required closure of the through Thameslink line for eight months in 2004–05, with trains from the north terminating at St Pancras. The project then stalled, but was rescued by extra funding of £63 million in February 2006. The last train at King&#x27;s Cross Thameslink was the 23:59 from Haywards Heath, which called at the station at 01:08 on Sunday 9 December 2007. From 9 December 2007, Thameslink services began to call at the new platforms at St Pancras.

The ticket office on Pentonville Road and the foot tunnel linking it with King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station were retained and made available as an additional access point for tube passengers, albeit only between 07:00 and 20:00 on weekdays. London Underground closed the entrance indefinitely on 23 March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2021 Transport for London advised in response to a Freedom of Information request that it had no immediate plans to reopen it, because they were in the process of reviewing the utility of the entrance in light of the fact that the ticket office building requires structural improvement works.

<text>Metronidazole, sold under the brand name Flagyl among others, is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is an option for a first episode of mild-to-moderate &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis if vancomycin or fidaxomicin is unavailable. Metronidazole is available orally (by mouth), as a cream or gel, and by slow intravenous infusion (injection into a vein).
Common side effects include nausea, a metallic taste, loss of appetite, and headaches. Occasionally seizures or allergies to the medication may occur. Some state that metronidazole should not be used in early pregnancy, while others state doses for trichomoniasis are safe. Metronidazole is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding.
Metronidazole began to be commercially used in 1960 in France. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available in most areas of the world. In 2022, it was the 133rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Metronidazole has activity against some protozoans and most anaerobic bacteria (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive classes) but not the aerobic bacteria.

Metronidazole is primarily used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontal disease, amoebiasis, oral infections, giardiasis, trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as &quot;Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus&quot;, and &quot;Prevotella&quot; species. It is also often used to eradicate &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.

Metronidazole is bitter and so the liquid suspension contains metronidazole benzoate. This may require hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract and some sources speculate that it may be unsuitable in people with diarrhea or feeding-tubes in the duodenum or jejunum.

===Bacterial vaginosis===
Drugs of choice for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis include metronidazole and clindamycin.

An effective treatment option for mixed infectious vaginitis is a combination of clotrimazole and metronidazole.

===Trichomoniasis===
The 5-nitroimidazole drugs (metronidazole and tinidazole) are the mainstay of treatment for infection with &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;. Treatment for both the infected patient and the patient&#x27;s sexual partner is recommended, even if asymptomatic. Therapy other than 5-nitroimidazole drugs is also an option, but cure rates are much lower.

===Giardiasis===
Oral metronidazole is a treatment option for giardiasis, however, the increasing incidence of nitroimidazole resistance is leading to the increased use of other compound classes.

===Dracunculus===
In the case of &quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot; (Guinea worm), metronidazole merely facilitates worm extraction rather than killing the worm.

===&quot;C. difficile&quot; colitis===
Initial antibiotic therapy for less-severe &quot;Clostridioides difficile infection&quot; colitis (pseudomembranous colitis) consists of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin by mouth. In 2017, the IDSA generally recommended vancomycin and fidaxomicin over metronidazole. Vancomycin by mouth has been shown to be more effective in treating people with severe &quot;C. difficile&quot; colitis.

=== &quot;E. histolytica&quot; ===
&quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; invasive amebiasis is treated with metronidazole for eradication, in combination with diloxanide to prevent recurrence. Although it is generally a standard treatment it is associated with some side effects.

===Preterm births===
Metronidazole has also been used in women to prevent preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). Metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women (selected by history and a positive fFN test) and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was found to be higher in women treated with metronidazole.

===Hypoxic radiosensitizer===
In addition to its anti-biotic properties, attempts were also made to use a possible radiation-sensitizing effect of metronidazole in the context of radiation therapy against hypoxic tumors. However, the neurotoxic side effects occurring at the required dosages have prevented the widespread use of metronidazole as an adjuvant agent in radiation therapy. However, other nitroimidazoles derived from metronidazole such as nimorazole with reduced electron affinity showed less serious neuronal side effects and have found their way into radio-onological practice for head and neck tumors in some countries.

=== Perioral dermatitis ===
&quot;Canadian Family Physician&quot; has recommended topical metronidazole as a third-line treatment for the perioral dermatitis either along with or without oral tetracycline or oral erythromycin as first and second line treatment respectively.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of those treated with the drug) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and paraesthesia. High doses and long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole are associated with the development of leucopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system toxicity. Common adverse drug reaction associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness and skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes). Metronidazole has been associated with cancer in animal studies. In rare cases, it can also cause temporary hearing loss that reverses after cessation of the treatment.

Some evidence from studies in rats indicates the possibility it may contribute to serotonin syndrome, although no case reports documenting this have been published to date.

===Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis===

In 2016 metronidazole was listed by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, oral exposure has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals and has also demonstrated some mutagenic effects in bacterial cultures. The relationship between exposure to metronidazole and human cancer is unclear. One study found an excess in lung cancer among women (even after adjusting for smoking), while other studies found either no increased risk, or a statistically insignificant risk.
Metronidazole is listed as a possible carcinogen according to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A study in those with Crohn&#x27;s disease also found chromosomal abnormalities in circulating lymphocytes in people treated with metronidazole.

===Stevens–Johnson syndrome===
Metronidazole alone rarely causes Stevens–Johnson syndrome, but is reported to occur at high rates when combined with mebendazole.

=== Neurotoxicity ===

Several studies in the human and animal models have recorded the neurotoxicity of metronidazole. One possible mechanism underlying this toxicity is that metronidazole may interference with postsynaptic central monoaminergic neurotransmission and immunomodulation. Additionally other research suggests that the role of nitric oxide isoforms and inflammatory cytokines may also play a role.

==Drug interactions==

===Alcohol===
Consuming alcohol while taking metronidazole has been suspected in case reports to cause a disulfiram-like reaction with effects that can include nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. People are often advised not to drink alcohol during systemic metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion of treatment. However, some studies call into question the mechanism of the interaction of alcohol and metronidazole,
and a possible central toxic serotonin reaction for the alcohol intolerance is suggested. Metronidazole is also generally thought to inhibit the liver metabolism of propylene glycol (found in some foods, medicines, and in many electronic cigarette e-liquids), thus propylene glycol may potentially have similar interaction effects with metronidazole.

===Other drug interactions===
Metronidazole is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme CYP2C9 belonging to the cytochrome P450 family. As a result, metronidazole may interact with medications metabolized by this enzyme. Examples of such medications are lomitapide and warfarin, to name a few.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Metronidazole is of the nitroimidazole class. It is a prodrug that inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by forming nitroso radicals, which disrupt the DNA of microbial cells. Metronidazole activates by receiving an electron from the reduced ferredoxin produced by pyruvate synthase (PFOR) in anaerobic organisms, equivalent to pyruvate dehydrogenase in aerobic organisms, thus turning into a highly reactive radical anion. After the radical loses the electron to its target, it recycles back to the unactivated form of metronidazole, ready to be activated again. 

This function only occurs when metronidazole is partially reduced, and because oxygen competes with metronidazole for the electron, this reduction requires a local environment with low oxygen concentration that usually happens only in anaerobic bacteria and protozoans. Therefore, it has relatively little effect upon human cells or aerobic bacteria. Elevation of oxygen level in the organism will decrease its rate of generating the activated metronidazole, but also increase the rate of recycling back to the unactivated metronidazole. 

===Pharmacokinetics===

Oral metronidazole is approximately 80% bioavailable via the gut and peak blood plasma concentrations occur after one to two hours. Food may slow down absorption but does not diminish it. Of the circulating substance, about 20% is bound to plasma proteins. It penetrates well into tissues, the cerebrospinal fluid, the amniotic fluid and breast milk, as well as into abscess cavities.

About 60% of the metronidazole is metabolized by oxidation to the main metabolite hydroxymetronidazole and a carboxylic acid derivative, and by glucuronidation. The metabolites show antibiotic and antiprotozoal activity &quot;in vitro&quot;. Metronidazole and its metabolites are mainly excreted via the kidneys (77%) and to a lesser extent via the faeces (14%). The biological half-life of metronidazole in healthy adults is eight hours, in infants during the first two months of their lives about 23 hours, and in premature babies up to 100 hours.

The biological activity of hydroxymetronidazole is 30% to 65%, and the elimination half-life is longer than that of the parent compound. The serum half-life of hydroxymetronidazole after suppository was 10 hours, 19 hours after intravenous infusion, and 11 hours after a tablet.

=== Resistance ===
Resistance in parasites is found in &quot;T. vaginilis&quot;, and &quot;G. lamblia&quot;, but not &quot;E. histolytica&quot;, and two major methods are observed. The first method involves an impaired oxygen scavenging capability that increase the local concentration of oxygen, leading to the decreased activation and increased recycling of metronidazole. The second method is associated with lowered levels of pyruvate synthase and ferredoxin, the latter due to the lowered transcription of the ferredoxin gene. Strains employing the second method will still respond to a higher dosage of metronidazole.

Resistance in bacteria is documented in &quot;Bacteriodes&quot; spp. that resistant to nitroimidazoles including metronidazole. In the resistant strains, 5-nitroimidazole reductase is identified as the culprit that actively reduces metronidazole to inactive forms. Currently eleven types are identified which are encoded by &quot;nimA&quot; through &quot;nimK&quot; respectively. The gene is encoded either in the chromosome or the episome.

Other mechanisms may include reduced drug activation, efflux pumps, altered redox potential and biofilm formation. In the recent years it is observed that the resistance to metronidazole is increasingly common, complicating its clinical effectiveness.

== History ==
The drug was initially developed by Rhône-Poulenc in the 1950s and licensed to G.D. Searle. Searle was acquired by Pfizer in 2003. The original patent expired in 1982, but evergreening reformulation occurred thereafter.

== Brand name ==
In India, it is sold under the brand name Metrogyl and Flagyl. In Bangladesh, it is available as Amodis, Amotrex, Dirozyl, Filmet, Flagyl, Flamyd, Metra, Metrodol, Metryl, etc. In Pakistan, it is sold under the brand name of Flagyl and Metrozine. In the United States it is sold under the brand name Noritate.

==Synthesis==
2-Methylimidazole (1) may be prepared via the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, or from ethylenediamine and acetic acid, followed by treatment with lime, then Raney nickel. 2-Methylimidazole is nitrated to give 2-methyl-4(5)-nitroimidazole (2), which is in turn alkylated with ethylene oxide or 2-chloroethanol to give metronidazole (3):

==Research==
Metronidazole is researched for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Studies have shown that metronidazole can decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide by activated immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils. Metronidazole&#x27;s immunomodulatory properties are thought to be related to its ability to decrease the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor that regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including chemokines, and adhesion molecules. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Chemokines are a type of cytokines that act as chemoattractants, meaning they attract and guide immune cells to specific sites in the body where they are needed. Cell adhesion molecules play an important role in the immune response by facilitating the interaction between immune cells and other cells in the body, such as endothelial cells, which form the lining of blood vessels. By inhibiting NF-κB activation, metronidazole can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1β.

Metronidazole has been studied in various immunological disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, periodontitis, and rosacea. In these conditions, metronidazole has been suspected to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in the treatment of these conditions. Despite the success in treating rosacea with metronidazole, the exact mechanism of why metronidazole in rosacea is efficient is not precisely known, i.e., which properties of metronidazole help treat rosacea: antibacterial or immunomodulatory or both, or other mechanism is involved. Increased ROS production in rosacea is thought to contribute to the inflammatory process and skin damage, so metronidazole&#x27;s ability to decrease ROS may explain the mechanism of action in this disease, but this remains speculation.

Metronidazole is also researched as a potential anti-inflammatory agent in periodontitis treatment.

==Veterinary use==
Metronidazole is used to treat infections of &quot;Giardia&quot; in dogs, cats, and other companion animals, but it does not reliably clear infection with this organism and is being supplanted by fenbendazole for this purpose in dogs and cats. It is also used for the management of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infections, periodontal disease, and systemic infections in cats and dogs. Another common usage is the treatment of systemic and/or gastrointestinal clostridial infections in horses. Metronidazole is used in the aquarium hobby to treat ornamental fish and as a broad-spectrum treatment for bacterial and protozoan infections in reptiles and amphibians. In general, the veterinary community may use metronidazole for any potentially susceptible anaerobic infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests it only be used when necessary because it has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats, as well as to prevent antimicrobial resistance.

The appropriate dosage of metronidazole varies based on the animal species, the condition being treated and the specific formulation of the product.

<text>Hatha yoga (; IAST: &quot;Haṭha-yoga&quot;) is a branch of yoga that uses physical techniques to try to preserve and channel vital force or energy. The Sanskrit word हठ &quot;haṭha&quot; literally means &quot;force&quot;, alluding to a system of physical techniques. Some hatha yoga style techniques can be traced back at least to the 1st-century CE, in texts such as the Hindu Sanskrit epics and Buddhism&#x27;s Pali canon. The oldest dated text so far found to describe hatha yoga, the 11th-century &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot;, comes from a tantric Buddhist milieu. The oldest texts to use the terminology of &quot;hatha&quot; are also Vajrayana Buddhist. Hindu hatha yoga texts appear from the 11th century onward. 

Some of the early hatha yoga texts (11th-13th c.) describe methods to raise and conserve bindu (vital force, that is, semen, and in women &quot;rajas –&quot; menstrual fluid). This was seen as the physical essence of life that was constantly dripping down from the head and being lost. Two early hatha yoga techniques sought to either physically reverse this process of dripping by using gravity to trap the bindhu in inverted postures like &quot;viparītakaraṇī&quot;, or force bindu upwards through the central channel by directing the breath flow into the centre channel using mudras (yogic seals, not to be confused with hand mudras, which are gestures). 

Almost all hathayogic texts belong to the Nath siddhas, and the important early ones (11th-13th c.) are credited to Matsyendranatha and his disciple, Gorakhnath or Gorakshanath (11th c.). Early Nāth works teach a yoga based on raising kuṇḍalinī through energy channels and chakras, called Layayoga (&quot;the yoga of dissolution&quot;). However, other early Nāth texts like the &quot;Vivekamārtaṇḍa&quot; can be seen as co-opting the hatha yoga mudrās. Later Nāth as well as Śākta texts adopt the practices of hatha yoga mudras into a Saiva system, melding them with Layayoga methods, without mentioning bindu. These later texts promote a universalist yoga, available to all, &quot;without the need for priestly intermediaries, ritual paraphernalia or sectarian initiations.&quot;

In the 20th century, a development of hatha yoga focusing particularly on asanas (the physical postures) became popular throughout the world as a form of physical exercise. This modern form of yoga is now widely known simply as &quot;yoga&quot;.

==Origins==

===Earliest textual references===
According to the Indologist James Mallinson, some haṭha yoga style techniques practised only by ascetics can be traced back at least to the 1st-century CE, in texts such as the Sanskrit epics (Hinduism) and the Pali canon (Buddhism). The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted further back into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha also used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini. In the &quot;Mahāsaccaka sutta&quot; (MN 36), the Buddha mentions how physical practices such as various meditations on holding one&#x27;s breath did not help him &quot;attain to greater excellence in noble knowledge and insight which transcends the human condition.&quot; After trying these, he then sought another path to enlightenment. The term haṭha yoga was first used in the c. 3rd century &quot;Bodhisattvabhūmi&quot;, the phrase &quot;na haṭhayogena&quot; seemingly meaning only that the bodhisattva would get his qualities &quot;not by force&quot;.

===Transition from tantric Buddhism to Nāth hatha yoga===

====Tantric Buddhism====

The earliest mentions of haṭha yoga as a specific set of techniques are from some seventeen Vajrayana Buddhist texts, mainly tantric works from the 8th century onwards. In Puṇḍarīka&#x27;s c. 1030 &quot;Vimalaprabhā&quot; commentary on the &quot;Kālacakratantra&quot;, haṭha yoga is for the first time defined within the context of tantric sexual ritual:

While the actual means of practice are not specified, the forcing of the breath into the central channel and the restraining of ejaculation are central features of later haṭha yoga practice texts. 

The c. 11th century Amṛtasiddhi is the earliest substantial text describing Haṭha yoga, though it does not use the term; it is a tantric Buddhist work, and makes use of metaphors from alchemy. A manuscript states its date as 1160. The text teaches mahābandha, mahāmudrā, and mahāvedha which involve bodily postures and breath control, as a means to preserve amrta or bindu (vital energy) in the head (the &quot;moon&quot;) from dripping down the central channel and being burned by the fire (the &quot;sun&quot;) at the perineum. The text also attacks Vajrayana deity yoga as ineffective. According to Mallinson, later manuscripts and editions of this text have obscured or omitted the Buddhist elements (such as the deity Chinnamasta which appears in the earliest manuscripts and was originally a Buddhist deity, only appearing in Hindu works after the 16th century). However, the earliest manuscript makes it clear that this text originated in a Vajrayana Buddhist milieu. The inscription at the end of one &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot; manuscript ascribes the text to &quot;Mādhavacandra&quot; or &quot;Avadhūtacandra&quot; and is &quot;said to represent the teachings of &quot;Virūpākṣa&quot;&quot;. According to Mallinson, this figure is most likely the Buddhist mahasiddha Virupa.

====Early Hindu texts====

The c. 10th century Kubjikāmatatantra anticipates haṭha yoga with its description of the raising of Kundalini, and a 6-chakra system.

Around the 11th century, techniques associated with Haṭha yoga also begin to be outlined in a series of early Hindu texts. The aims of these practices were siddhis (supranormal powers such as levitation) and mukti (liberation). 

In India, haṭha yoga is associated in popular tradition with the Yogis of the Natha Sampradaya. Almost all hathayogic texts belong to the Nath siddhas, and the important ones are credited to Gorakhnath or Gorakshanath (c. early 11th century), the founder of the Nath Hindu monastic movement in India, though those texts post-date him. Goraknath is regarded by the contemporary Nath-tradition as the disciple of Matsyendranath (early 10th century), who is celebrated as a saint in both Hindu and Buddhist tantric and haṭha yoga schools, and regarded by tradition as the founder of the Natha Sampradaya. Early haṭha yoga works include:

* The Amaraugha (12th century, attributed to Goraknath) describes three bandhas to lock the vital energy into the body, as in the &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot;, but adding the raising of Kundalinī.
* The Dattātreyayogaśāstra, a Vaisnava text probably composed in the 13th century, is the earliest text which provides a systematized form of Haṭha yoga, and the earliest to place its yoga techniques under the name Haṭha. It teaches an eightfold yoga identical with Patañjali&#x27;s 8 limbs that it attributes to Yajnavalkya and others as well as eight mudras that it says were undertaken by the rishi Kapila and other ṛishis. The &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&quot; teaches mahāmudrā, mahābandha, khecarīmudrā, jālandharabandha, uḍḍiyāṇabandha, mūlabandha, viparītakaraṇī, vajrolī, amarolī, and sahajolī.
* The Vivekamārtaṇḍa, an early Nāth text (13th century) attributed to Goraknath, contemporaneous with the &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&quot;, teaches nabhomudrā (i.e. khecarīmudrā), mahāmudrā, viparītakaraṇī and the three bandhas. It also teaches six chakras and the raising of Kundalinī by means of &quot;fire yoga&quot; (&quot;vahniyogena&quot;). 
* The Gorakṣaśataka, a Nāth text of the same period (13th century), teaches śakticālanīmudrā (&quot;stimulating Sarasvatī&quot;) along with the three bandhas. &quot;Stimulating Sarasvat&quot; is done by wrapping the tongue in a cloth and pulling on it, stimulating the goddess Kundalinī who is said to dwell at the other end of the central channel. This text does not mention the preservation of bindu, but merely says that liberation is achieved by controlling the mind through controlling the breath. 
* The ̣Śārṅgadharapaddhati, an anthology of verses on a wide range of subjects compiled by Sharngadharain 1363, describes Haṭha yoga including ̣the &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&#x27;s&quot; teachings on five mudrās.
* The Khecarīvidyā (14th century) teaches only the method of khecarīmudrā, which is meant to give one access to stores of amrta in the body and to raise Kundalinī via the six chakras.
* The Yogabīja (c. 14th century) teaches the three bandhas and śakticālanīmudrā (&quot;stimulating Sarasvatī&quot;) for the purpose of awakening Kundalinī. 
*The Śivasamhitā: a 14th or 15th century text. Its first chapter summarizes Śaiva non-dualism and Śrīvidyā Śāktism; the rest of the text describes yoga, the importance of a guru (teacher) to a student, various asanas and mudras, and the siddhis (powers) to be attained with yoga and tantra.


The earliest haṭha yoga methods of the &quot;Amṛtasiddhi&quot;, &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&quot; and &quot;Vivekamārtaṇḍa&quot; are used to raise and conserve bindu (semen, and in women &quot;rajas –&quot; menstrual fluid) which was seen as the physical essence of life that was constantly dripping down from the head and being lost. This vital essence is also sometimes called amrta (the nectar of immortality). These techniques sought to either physically reverse this process (by inverted postures like &quot;viparītakaraṇī&quot;) or use the breath to force bindu upwards through the central channel.

In contrast to these, early Nāth works like the &quot;Gorakṣaśataka&quot; and the &quot;Yogabīja&quot; teach a yoga based on raising Kundalinī (through śakticālanī mudrā). This is not called haṭha yoga in these early texts, but Layayoga (&quot;the yoga of dissolution&quot;). However, other early Nāth texts like the &quot;Vivekamārtaṇḍa&quot; can be seen as co-opting the mudrās of haṭha yoga meant to preserve bindu. Then, in later Nāth as well as Śākta texts, the adoption of haṭha yoga is more developed, and focused solely on the raising of Kundalinī without mentioning bindu.

Mallinson sees these later texts as promoting a universalist yoga, available to all, without the need to study the metaphysics of Samkhya-yoga or the complex esotericism of Shaiva Tantra. Instead this &quot;democratization of yoga&quot; led to the teaching of these techniques to all people, &quot;without the need for priestly intermediaries, ritual paraphernalia or sectarian initiations.&quot;

===Classical haṭha yoga===

==== &quot;Haṭhayogapradīpikā&quot;====
The &quot;Haṭhayogapradīpikā&quot; is one of the most influential texts of Haṭha yoga. It was compiled by Svātmārāma in the 15th century CE from earlier Haṭha yoga texts. Earlier texts were of Vedanta or non-dual Shaiva orientation, and from both, the &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradīpika&quot; borrowed the philosophy of non-duality (advaita). According to Mallinson, this reliance on non-duality helped Haṭha yoga thrive in the medieval period as non-duality became the &quot;dominant soteriological method in scholarly religious discourse in India&quot;. The text lists 35 great yoga siddhas starting with Adi Natha (Hindu god Shiva) followed by Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath. It includes information about shatkarma (six acts of self purification), 15 asana (postures: seated, laying down, and non-seated), pranayama (breathing) and kumbhaka (breath retention), mudras (internalized energetic practices), meditation, chakras (centers of energy), kundalini, nadanusandhana (concentration on inner sound), and other topics. The text includes the contradictory goals of raising Bindu, inherited from the &quot;Amritasiddhi&quot;, and of raising Kundalini, inherited from the &quot;Kubjikamatatantra&quot;.


====Post-&quot;Hathayogapradipika&quot; texts====

Post-&quot;Hathayogapradipika&quot; texts on Haṭha yoga include:

* Amaraughasasana: a Sharada script manuscript of this Haṭha yoga text was copied in 1525 CE. It is notable because fragments of this manuscript have also been found near Kuqa in Xinjiang (China). The text discusses &quot;khecarimudra&quot;, but calls it &quot;saranas&quot;. It links the squatting pose Utkatasana, rather than the use of mudras, with the raising of Kundalini.
* Yogacintamani: an early 17th-century text on the eight auxiliaries of yoga; the asana section describes 34 asanas, and variant manuscripts add another 84, mentioning most of the non-standing asanas used in modern yoga.
* Hatha Ratnavali: a 17th-century text that states that Haṭha yoga consists of ten mudras, eight cleansing methods, nine kumbhakas and 84 asanas. The text is also notable for dropping the nadanusandhana (inner sound) technique.
* Hathapradipika Siddhantamuktavali: an early 18th-century text that expands on the &quot;Hathayogapradipikạ&quot; by adding practical insights and citations to other Indian texts on yoga.
* Gheranda Samhita: a 17th or 18th-century text that presents Haṭha yoga as &quot;ghatastha yoga&quot;, according to Mallinson. It presents 6 cleansing methods, 32 asanas, 25 mudras and 10 pranayamas. It is one of the most encyclopedic texts on Haṭha yoga.
* Jogapradipika: an 18th-century Braj-language text by Ramanandi Jayatarama that presents Haṭha yoga simply as &quot;yoga&quot;. It presents 6 cleansing methods, 84 asanas, 24 mudras and 8 kumbhakas.

===Modern era===

According to Mallinson, Haṭha yoga has been a broad movement across the Indian traditions, openly available to anyone:

Haṭha yoga represented a trend towards the democratization of yoga insights and religion similar to the Bhakti movement. It eliminated the need for &quot;either ascetic renunciation or priestly intermediaries, ritual paraphernalia and sectarian initiations&quot;. This led to its broad historic popularity in India. Later in the 20th century, states Mallinson, this disconnect of Haṭha yoga from religious aspects and the democratic access of Haṭha yoga enabled it to spread worldwide.

Between the 17th and 19th century, however, the various urban Hindu and Muslim elites and ruling classes viewed Yogis with derision. They were persecuted during the rule of Aurangzeb; this ended a long period of religious tolerance that had defined the rule of his predecessors beginning with Akbar, who famously studied with the yogis and other mystics. Haṭha yoga remained popular in rural India. Negative impression for the Hatha yogis continued during the British colonial rule era. According to Mark Singleton, this historical negativity and colonial antipathy likely motivated Swami Vivekananda to make an emphatic distinction between &quot;merely physical exercises of Haṭha yoga&quot; and the &quot;higher spiritual path of Raja yoga&quot;. This common disdain by the officials and intellectuals slowed the study and adoption of Haṭha yoga.

A well-known school of Haṭha yoga from the 20th century is the Divine Life Society founded by Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh (1887–1963) and his many disciples including, among others, Swami Vishnu-devananda – founder of International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres; Swami Satyananda – of the Bihar School of Yoga; and Swami Satchidananda of Integral Yoga. The Bihar School of Yoga has been one of the largest Haṭha yoga teacher training centers in India but is little known in Europe and the Americas.

Theos Casimir Bernard&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;Hatha Yoga: The Report of A Personal Experience&quot; provides an informative but fictionalised account of traditional Haṭha yoga as a spiritual path.

===Yoga as exercise===


Yoga as exercise, of the type seen in the West, has been greatly influenced by Swami Kuvalayananda and his student Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who taught from 1924 until his death in 1989. Both Kuvalayananda and Krishnamacharya combined asanas from Haṭha yoga with gymnastic exercises from the physical culture of the time, dropping most of its religious aspects, to develop a flowing style of physical yoga that placed little or no emphasis on Haṭha yoga&#x27;s spiritual goals. Among Krishnamacharya&#x27;s students prominent in popularizing yoga in the West were K. Pattabhi Jois famous for popularizing the vigorous Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga style, B. K. S. Iyengar who emphasized alignment and the use of props in Iyengar Yoga, and by Indra Devi and Krishnamacharya&#x27;s son T. K. V. Desikachar. Krishnamacharya-linked schools have become widely known in the Western world. Examples of other branded forms of yoga, with some controversies, that make use of Haṭha yoga include Anusara Yoga, Bikram Yoga, Integral Yoga, Jivamukti Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Kripalu Yoga, Kriya Yoga, Sivananda Yoga and Viniyoga. After about 1975, yoga has become increasingly popular globally, in both developed and developing countries.

==Practice==
Haṭha yoga practice is complex and requires certain characteristics of the yogi. Section 1.16 of the &quot;Haṭha yoga Pradipika&quot;, for example, states these to be &quot;utsaha&quot; (enthusiasm, fortitude), &quot;sahasa&quot; (courage), &quot;dhairya&quot; (patience), &quot;jnana tattva&quot; (essence for knowledge), &quot;nishcaya&quot; (resolve, determination) and &quot;tyaga&quot; (solitude, renunciation).

In Western culture, Haṭha yoga is typically understood as exercise using &quot;asanas&quot; and it can be practiced as such. In the Indian and Tibetan traditions, Haṭha yoga integrates ideas of ethics, diet, cleansing, pranayama (breathing exercises), meditation and a system for spiritual development of the yogi.

===Goals===

The aims of Haṭha yoga in various Indian traditions have included physical &quot;siddhis&quot; (special powers, bodily benefits such as slowing age effects, magical powers) and spiritual liberation (moksha, mukti). According to Mikel Burley, some of the &quot;siddhis&quot; are symbolic references to the cherished soteriological goals of Indian religions. For example, the &quot;Vayu Siddhi&quot; or &quot;conquest of the air&quot; literally implies rising into the air as in levitation, but it likely has a symbolic meaning of &quot;a state of consciousness into a vast ocean of space&quot; or &quot;voidness&quot; ideas found respectively in Hinduism and Buddhism.

Some traditions such as the Kaula tantric sect of Hinduism and Sahajiya tantric sect of Buddhism pursued more esoteric goals such as alchemy (Nagarjuna, Carpita), magic, &quot;kalavancana&quot; (cheating death) and &quot;parakayapravesa&quot; (entering another&#x27;s body). Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga&#x27;s goal as meditation–driven means to liberation in Indian religions. The majority of historic Haṭha yoga texts do not give any importance to &quot;siddhis&quot;. The mainstream practice considered the pursuit of magical powers as a distraction or hindrance to Haṭha yoga&#x27;s ultimate aim of spiritual liberation, self-knowledge or release from rebirth that the Indian traditions call &quot;mukti&quot; or &quot;moksha&quot;.

The goals of Haṭha yoga, in its earliest texts, were linked to &quot;mumukshu&quot; (seeker of liberation, moksha). The later texts added and experimented with the goals of &quot;bubhukshu&quot; (seeker of enjoyment, bhoga).

===Diet===
Some Haṭha texts place major emphasis on &quot;mitahara&quot;, which means &quot;measured diet&quot; or &quot;moderate eating&quot;. For example, sections 1.58 to 1.63 and 2.14 of the &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradipika&quot; and sections 5.16 to 5.32 of the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; discuss the importance of proper diet to the body. They link the food one eats and one&#x27;s eating habits to balancing the body and gaining most benefits from the practice of Haṭha yoga. Eating, states the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot;, is a form of a devotional act to the temple of body, as if one is expressing affection for the gods. Similarly, sections 3.20 and 5.25 of the &quot;Shiva Samhita&quot; includes &quot;mitahara&quot; as an essential part of a holistic Haṭha yoga practice.

Verses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradipika&quot; suggests that taste cravings should not drive one&#x27;s eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one&#x27;s body and for one&#x27;s inner self. It recommends that one must &quot;eat only when one feels hungry&quot; and &quot;neither overeat nor eat to completely fill one&#x27;s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water&quot;.

According to another text, the &quot;Goraksha Sataka&quot;, eating a controlled diet is one of the three important parts of a complete and successful practice. The text does not provide details or recipes. The text states, according to Mallinson, &quot;food should be unctuous and sweet&quot;, one must not overeat and stop when still a bit hungry (leave a quarter of the stomach empty), and whatever one eats should please Shiva.

===Purifications===

Haṭha yoga teaches various steps of inner body cleansing with consultations of one&#x27;s yoga teacher. Its texts vary in specifics and number of cleansing methods, ranging from simple hygiene practices to the peculiar exercises such as reversing seminal fluid flow. The most common list is called the &quot;shatkarmas&quot;, or six cleansing actions: &quot;dhauti&quot; (cleanse teeth and body), &quot;basti&quot; (cleanse rectum), &quot;neti&quot; (cleanse nasal passages), &quot;trataka&quot; (cleanse eyes), &quot;nauli&quot; (abdominal massage) and &quot;kapalabhati&quot; (cleanse phlegm). The actual procedure for cleansing varies by the Haṭha yoga text, some suggesting a water wash and others describing the use of cleansing aids such as cloth.

===Breath control===
Prāṇāyāma is made out of two Sanskrit words &quot;prāṇa&quot; (प्राण, breath, vital energy, life force) and &quot;āyāma&quot; (आयाम, restraining, extending, stretching).

Some Haṭha yoga texts teach breath exercises but do not refer to it as Pranayama. For example, section 3.55 of the &quot;GherandaSamhita&quot; calls it &quot;Ghatavastha&quot; (state of being the pot). In others, the term &quot;Kumbhaka&quot; or &quot;Prana-samrodha&quot; replaces Pranayama. Regardless of the nomenclature, proper breathing and the use of breathing techniques during a posture is a mainstay of Haṭha yoga. Its texts state that proper breathing exercises cleanse and balance the body.

&quot;Pranayama&quot; is one of the core practices of Haṭha yoga, found in its major texts as one of the limbs regardless of whether the total number of limbs taught are four or more. It is the practice of consciously regulating breath (inhalation and exhalation), a concept shared with all schools of yoga.

This is done in several ways, inhaling and then suspending exhalation for a period, exhaling and then suspending inhalation for a period, slowing the inhalation and exhalation, consciously changing the time/length of breath (deep, short breathing), combining these with certain focussed muscle exercises. &quot;Pranayama&quot; or proper breathing is an integral part of &quot;asanas&quot;. According to section 1.38 of &quot;Haṭha yoga pradipika&quot;, &quot;Siddhasana&quot; is the most suitable and easiest posture to learn breathing exercises.

The different Haṭha yoga texts discuss &quot;pranayama&quot; in various ways. For example, &quot;Haṭha yoga pradipka&quot; in section 2.71 explains it as a threefold practice: &quot;recaka&quot; (exhalation), &quot;puraka&quot; (inhalation) and &quot;kumbhaka&quot; (retention). During the exhalation and inhalation, the text states that three things move: air, prana and yogi&#x27;s thoughts, and all three are intimately connected. It is &quot;kumbhaka&quot; where stillness and dissolution emerges. The text divides &quot;kumbhaka&quot; into two kinds: &quot;sahita&quot; (supported) and &quot;kevala&quot; (complete). &quot;Sahita kumbhaka&quot; is further sub-divided into two types: retention with inhalation, retention with exhalation. Each of these breath units are then combined in different permutations, time lengths, posture and targeted muscle exercises in the belief that these aerate and assist blood flow to targeted regions of the body.

===Posture===

Before starting yoga practice, state the Haṭha yoga texts, the yogi must establish a suitable place. This is to be away from all distractions, preferably a &quot;mathika&quot; (hermitage) distant from falling rocks, fire and a damp shifting surface. Once a peaceful stable location has been chosen, the yogi begins the posture exercises called &quot;asanas&quot;. These postures come in numerous forms. For a beginner, states the historian of religion Mircea Eliade, the&quot; asanas&quot; are uncomfortable, typically difficult, cause the body to shake, and are typically unbearable to hold for extended periods of time. However, with repetition and persistence, as the muscle tone improves, the effort reduces and posture improves. According to the Haṭha yoga texts, each posture becomes perfect when the &quot;effort disappears&quot;, one no longer thinks about the posture and one&#x27;s body position, breathes normally in &quot;pranayama&quot;, and is able to dwell in one&#x27;s meditation (&quot;anantasamapattibhyam&quot;).

The &quot;asanas&quot; vary significantly between Haṭha yoga texts, and some of the names are used for different poses. Most of the early &quot;asanas&quot; are inspired by nature, such as a form of union with symmetric, harmonious flowing shapes of animals, birds or plants.

===Mudras===

According to Mallinson, in the earliest formulations, Haṭha yoga was a means to raise and preserve the bindu, believed to be one of the vital energies. The two early Haṭha yoga techniques to achieve this were inverted poses to trap the bindu using gravity, or mudras (yogic seals) to make breath flow into the centre channel and force bindu up. However, in later Haṭha yoga, the Kaula visualization of Kuṇḍalini rising through a system of chakras was overlaid onto the earlier bindu-oriented system. The aim was to access amṛta (the nectar of immortality) situated in the head, which subsequently floods the body, in contradiction with the early Haṭha yoga goal of preserving bindu.

The classical sources for the mudras are the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;. The yoga mudras are diverse in the parts of the body involved and in the procedures required, as in Mula Bandha, Mahamudra, Viparita Karani, Khecarī mudrā, and Vajroli mudra.

===Meditation===

The &quot;Haṭha Yoga Pradipika&quot; text dedicates almost a third of its verses to meditation. Similarly, other major texts of Haṭha yoga such as the &quot;Shiva Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; discuss meditation. In all three texts, meditation is the ultimate goal of all the preparatory cleansing, asanas, pranayama and other steps. The aim of this meditation is to realize &quot;Nada-Brahman&quot;, or the complete absorption and union with the Brahman through inner mystic sound. According to Guy Beck – a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Yoga and music, a Hatha yogi in this stage of practice seeks &quot;inner union of physical opposites&quot;, into an inner state of samadhi that is described by Haṭha yoga texts in terms of divine sounds, and as a union with &quot;Nada-Brahman&quot; in musical literature of ancient India.

==Differences from Patanjali yoga==

Haṭha yoga is a branch of yoga. It shares numerous ideas and doctrines with other forms of yoga, such as the more ancient system taught by Patanjali. The differences are in the addition of some aspects, and different emphasis on others. For example, &quot;pranayama&quot; is crucial in all yogas, but it is the mainstay of Haṭha yoga. Mudras and certain kundalini-related ideas are included in Haṭha yoga, but not mentioned in the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;. Patanjali yoga considers &quot;asanas&quot; important but dwells less on various &quot;asanas&quot; than the Haṭha yoga texts. In contrast, the Haṭha yoga texts consider meditation as important but dwell less on meditation methodology than Patanjali yoga.

The Haṭha yoga texts acknowledge and refer to Patanjali yoga, attesting to the latter&#x27;s antiquity. However, this acknowledgment is essentially only in passing, as they offer no serious commentary or exposition of Patanjali&#x27;s system. This suggests that Haṭha yoga developed as a branch of the more ancient yoga. According to P.V. Kane, Patanjali yoga concentrates more on the yoga of the mind, while Haṭha yoga focuses on body and health. Some Hindu texts do not recognize this distinction. For example, the &quot;Yogatattva Upanishad&quot; teaches a system that includes all aspects of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; of Patanjali, and all additional elements of Haṭha yoga practice.

<text>LaMarcus Adna Thompson (March 8, 1848 – May 8, 1919) was an American inventor and businessman most famous for developing a variety of gravity rides and roller coasters.

==Early years==
Thompson was born in Jersey, Licking County, Ohio on March 8, 1848. His parents were Adna Thompson (father), and Nancy D. Thompson (mother). He had a brother named Olvid. In his adolescence, he became a skilled carpenter. In 1873 he began operating a grocery store in Elkhart, Indiana. There he began designing a device to manufacture seamless stockings and tights for women. He made a fortune in that business, but failing health forced him to quit.

==Father of the gravity ride and the roller coaster==
Thompson is best known for his early work developing roller coasters and for inventing the scenic railway genre of rides. He is known as the &quot;Father of the American Roller Coaster&quot; and is often also called the &quot;Father of the Gravity Ride&quot;. Over his lifetime, Thompson accumulated nearly thirty patents related to roller coaster technologies. An example is the patent granted December 22, 1884, for the &quot;Gravity Switch-back Railway&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s work built upon an earlier patent for an &quot;Inclined Plane Railway&quot;, filed in 1878 by Richard Knudson.

Thompson&#x27;s breakthrough ride was the &quot;Gravity Switchback Railway&quot;, which opened at Coney Island in 1884. A (6 mph) ride cost 5 cents. In 1887, along with designer James A. Griffiths, he opened the Scenic Railway on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, N.J. Thompson&#x27;s scenic railway concept initially was intended to give riders a scenic view of the surrounding landscape; later, Thompson created elaborate painted backgrounds and scenes so that riders would feel like they were touring the Swiss Alps or other foreign landscapes.

Thompson was managing director of the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, 220 West 42nd St., incorporated in 1895. Thompson&#x27;s scenic railways were immensely popular during the first and second decade of the 1900s, and his company operated six major scenic railways at Coney Island alone during that time. Dozens of scenic railways operated throughout the U.S. and in Europe. Eventually, the scenic railway was eclipsed by faster and more thrilling roller coaster rides made possible by improvements in roller coaster safety technology.

Thompson died at his home, Thompson Park, Glen Cove, Long Island, on May 8, 1919, at age 71.

<text>Jewish ethics are the ethics of the Jewish religion or the Jewish people. A type of normative ethics, Jewish ethics may involve issues in Jewish law as well as non-legal issues, and may involve the convergence of Judaism and the Western philosophical tradition of ethics.

==Literature==

===Biblical and rabbinic===

Ethical traditions can be found throughout the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinic Oral Torah that both interpreted the Hebrew Bible and engaged in novel topics.

Ethics is a key aspect of legal rabbinic literature, the literature of halakhah, found in the Mishnah, Talmud and other texts. Ethics is also a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, the literature of aggadah. The best-known text in Rabbinic Judaism associated with ethics is the non-legal Mishnah tractate of &quot;Avot&quot; (“forefathers”), commonly translated as “Ethics of the Fathers&quot;.

===Medieval===
Direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings in the medieval period. Notably, Maimonides offers a Jewish interpretation of Aristotle (e.g., &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences Thomas Aquinas, a dominant figure in Christian ethics and the natural law tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval Jewish philosophy is a matter of dispute among scholars.

Medieval and early modern rabbis also created a pietistic tradition of Jewish ethics. This ethical tradition was given expression through Musar literature, which presents virtues and vices in a didactic way. The Hebrew term &quot;musar&quot;, derived from a word meaning &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;correction&quot;, is often translated as ethics, morality, moral instruction, or moral discipline.

Examples of medieval Musar literature include:
* &quot;Chovot HaLevavot&quot; &#x27;Duties of the Heart&#x27; by Bahya ibn Paquda
* &quot;Ma&#x27;alot ha-Middot&quot; by Jehiel ben Jekuthiel Anav of Rome
* &quot;Orchot Tzaddikim&quot; &quot;The Ways of the Righteous&quot; by an anonymous author
* &quot;Kad ha-Kemah&quot; by Bahya ben Asher

Halakhic (legal) writings of the Middle Ages are also important texts for Jewish ethics. Important sources of Jewish ethical law include Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (12th century) and Joseph Karo and Moses Isserles&#x27;s &quot;Shulkhan Arukh&quot; (16th century), especially the section of that code titled &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot;. A wide array of topics on ethics are also discussed in medieval responsa literature.

===Modern===
In the modern period, Jewish ethics sprouted many offshoots, partly due to developments in modern ethics and partly due to the formation of Jewish denominations. Trends in modern Jewish normative ethics include:
* The pietistic musar tradition was continued by 18th-century rabbis such as Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in his book &quot;Mesillat Yesharim&quot;. Other musar writings were authored by Haskalah writers such as Naphtali Herz Wessely and Menachem Mendel Lefin.
* The musar tradition was revived by the Jewish ethics education movement known as the Musar Movement that developed in the 19th-century Orthodox Jewish European (Ashkenazi) community.
* The 19th- and early 20th-century Reform movement promoted the idea of Judaism as Ethical Monotheism. The writings of Abraham Geiger and Kaufmann Kohler show this approach.
* In the 20th and 21st centuries, liberal Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have fostered novel approaches to Jewish ethics, for example in the writings of Eugene Borowitz and David Teutsch. Some Reform rabbis have also engaged in applied ethics by writing legal responsa (formal opinions).
* In 20th and 21st centuries, Orthodox rabbis often engage in applied ethics by interpreting rabbinic law (Halakha) in responsa. A dominant topic has been bioethics.
* 20th- and 21st-century rabbis in Conservative Judaism have also produced legal responsa on a wide range of topics. Dominant topics have included bioethics, sexual ethics, and business ethics. Leading Conservative ethicists such as the philosopher and rabbi Elliot Dorff have also written extensively on moral theory.
* In the 20th and 21st centuries, Jewish feminism has produced feminist Jewish ethics, using the principles of feminist ethics. Leading Jewish feminist ethicists include Judith Plaskow, Rachel Adler, Tamar Ross, Rebecca Alpert, and Laurie Zoloth.
* Other modern Jewish philosophers have pursued a range of ethical approaches, with varying degrees of reliance upon traditional Jewish sources. Notably, Hermann Cohen authored &quot;Religion of Reason&quot; in the tradition of Kantian ethics. Martin Buber wrote on various ethical and social topics, including the dialogical ethics of his &quot;I and Thou&quot;. Hans Jonas, a student of Martin Heidegger, draws upon phenomenology in his writings on bioethics, technology and responsibility. Emmanuel Levinas sought to distinguish his philosophical and Jewish writings; nevertheless, some scholars are constructing Jewish ethics around his innovative and deeply Jewish approach.

Academic scholars of Judaism have also engaged in descriptive Jewish ethics, the study of Jewish moral practices and theory, which is situated more in the disciplines of history and the social sciences than in &quot;ethics&quot; proper (see Newman 1998).

In 2003, the Society of Jewish Ethics was founded as the academic organization &quot;dedicated to the promotion of scholarly work in the field of Jewish ethics.&quot; The Society promotes both normative research (the field of ethics proper) and descriptive (historical/social scientific) research.

==Central virtues and principles==

=== Major themes in biblical ethics ===
The writings attributed to the biblical prophets exhort all people to lead a righteous life. Kindness to the needy, benevolence, faith, compassion for the suffering, a peace-loving disposition, and a truly humble and contrite spirit, are the virtues which many Prophets hold up for emulation, although Samuel and Moses were important exceptions, for Samuel urged the massacre of all Amalekites, including women and children, and Moses, concerning the Midianites, said &quot;Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.&quot;

Civic loyalty, even to a foreign ruler, is urged as a duty (Jer. 29:7). &quot;Learn to do good&quot; is the keynote of the prophetic appeal (Isa. 1:17). Prophets yearn for an era of peace and righteousness; war will be no more (Isa. 2:2 et seq.).

===Summaries of classical rabbinic ethics===
Hillel the Elder formulated a version of the Golden Rule: &quot;What is hateful to you, do not do unto others&quot;. Rabbi Akiva stated &quot;Whatever you hate to have done to you, do not do to your neighbor; therefore do not hurt him; do not speak ill of him; do not reveal his secrets to others; let his honor and his property be as precious to you as your own&quot;.

Rabbi Akiva also declared the commandment &quot;thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; to be the greatest fundamental commandment of the Jewish doctrine (compare to Great Commandment). Ben Azzai, in reference to this, said that a still greater principle was found in the Scriptural verse, &quot;This is the book of the generations of Adam [origin of man]. In the day that God created man [Adam], in the likeness of God made he him&quot;.

Rabbi Simlai taught &quot;613 commandments were given to Moses; then David came and reduced them to eleven in Psalm 15; Isaiah (33:15), to six; Micah (6:8), to three: &#x27;To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God&#x27;; Isaiah again (56:1), to two: &#x27;Maintain justice, and do what is right&#x27;; and Habakkuk (2:4), to one: &#x27;The righteous person lives by his faithfulness&#x27;.&quot;

===Justice, truth, and peace===
Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel taught: &quot;The world rests on three things: justice, truth, and peace&quot;.

Justice, being God&#x27;s, must be vindicated, whether the object is of great or small value. &quot;Let justice pierce the mountain&quot; is the characteristic maxim attributed to Moses. Stealing and oppression, even if only in holding back overnight the hired man&#x27;s earnings, are forbidden.

Falsehood, flattery, perjury and false swearing are also forbidden. The reputation of a fellow man is sacred. Tale-bearing and unkind insinuations are forbidden, as is hatred of one&#x27;s brother in one&#x27;s heart. A revengeful, relentless disposition is unethical; reverence for old age is inculcated; justice shall be done; right weight and just measure are demanded; poverty and riches shall not be regarded by the judge. We are taught to attempt judging others LeKaf Z&#x27;Chut, giving more weight to an assumed side of merit, yet advised what can be translated as Respect but Suspect (ChabDeiHu VeChashDeiHu).

Shalom (&quot;peace&quot;) is one of the underlying principles of the Torah, as &quot;her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are shalom (&#x27;peace&#x27;).&quot; The Talmud explains, &quot;The entire Torah is for the sake of the ways of shalom&quot;. Maimonides comments in his Mishneh Torah: &quot;Great is peace, as the whole Torah was given in order to promote peace in the world, as it is stated, &#x27;Her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace.

===Loving-kindness and compassion===

Simon the Just taught: &quot;The world rests upon three things: Torah, service to God, and showing loving-kindness (chesed)&quot;. Loving-kindness is here the core ethical virtue.

Loving-kindness is closely linked with compassion in the tradition. Lack of compassion marks people as cruel. The Torah repeatedly commands the Prophets to protect the widow, the orphan and the stranger.

Friendship is also highly prized in the Talmud; the very word for &quot;associate&quot; is &quot;friend&quot; (&quot;chaver&quot;). &quot;Get thyself a companion&quot;. &quot;Companionship or death&quot;.

Respect for one&#x27;s fellow humans is of such importance that Biblical prohibitions may be transgressed on its account. For example, the unclaimed dead must be given respectful burial.

===Health and self-respect===
In addition to teaching caring for others, Jewish sources tend to teach that humans are duty-bound to preserve their lives and health. Foods dangerous to health are more to be guarded against than those ritually forbidden. Jewish ethics denies self-abasement. &quot;He who subjects himself to needless self-castigations and fasting, or even denies himself the enjoyment of wine, is a sinner&quot;. People have to give account for every lawful enjoyment they refuse. A person should show self-respect in regard to both one&#x27;s body, &quot;honoring it as the image of God&quot;, and one&#x27;s garments. According to Judaism, real-life goes beyond the concept of breathing and having blood flow through our veins, it means existing with a purpose and connecting to God and others.

==Areas of applied Jewish ethics==

=== Business ethics ===

In the Torah, there are more commandments concerning the kashrut (fitness) of one&#x27;s money than the kashrut of food. These laws are developed and expanded upon in the Mishnah and the Talmud (particularly in Order Nezikin). The weights attached is evidenced via the widely quoted tradition (Talmud Shabbat 31a) that in one&#x27;s judgement in the next world, the first question asked is: &quot;were you honest in business?&quot;

Laws concerning business ethics are delineated in the major codes of Jewish law (e.g. Mishneh Torah, 12th century; Shulhan Arukh, particularly Choshen Mishpat, 16th century). A wide array of topics on business ethics are discussed in the responsa literature. Business ethics received special emphasis in the teaching of Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter (19th century), founder of the Musar movement in Eastern Europe. Enforcing laws regarding the proper treatment of workers in the food industry has been central to the efforts of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Hekhsher Tzedek commission and its 2008 approval of a responsum by Rabbi Jill Jacobs which required paying workers in accordance with Jewish law and treating workers with dignity and respect.

===Charitable giving===

The Jewish idea of righteousness (&quot;tzedakah&quot;) gives the owner of property no right to withhold from the poor their share. According to Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah, the highest level of tzedakah is giving charity that will allow the poor to break out of the poverty cycle and become independent and productive members of society. Tzedakah may come in the form of giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need; so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.

Traditional Jews commonly practice &quot;ma&#x27;aser kesafim&quot;, tithing 10% of their income to support those in need. The Rabbis decreed (against Essene practice, and against the advice given in the New Testament) that one should not give away much, most or all of their possessions. They did not expect a supernatural savior to come and take care of the poor, and so they held that one must not make oneself poor. Given that nearly all Jews of their day were poor or middle-class (even the rich of that time were only rich relative to the poor), they ruled that one should not give away more than a fifth of his income to charity, while yet being obligated to give away no less than 10% of his income to charity.

Many pages of the Talmud are devoted to encouragement in giving charity, and this topic is the focus of many religious books and rabbinic responsa.

In addition to voluntary individual donations to the poor, the Mishnah required communities to supply each person in need with daily food rations and a place to sleep, funded by collections from the population.

===Ethics of speech===

Evil-speaking is a sin regarded with intense aversion both in the Bible and in rabbinical literature. The technical term for it in the latter is lashon hara, &quot;the evil tongue&quot;. In the Bible, the equivalent words are: dibbah, meaning &quot;talk&quot; in a sinister sense; rakhil, the &quot;merchandise&quot; of gossip with which the talebearer goes about; and ragal, a verb, denoting the &quot;peddling&quot; of slander. As these words indicate, that which is condemned as lashon hara denotes all the deliberate or malicious accusations or even the exposure of truthful information which has the purpose of injuring one&#x27;s neighbor, that is, calumny proper, and also the idle but mischievous chatter which is equally forbidden, though it is not slander. The Babylonian Talmud indicates that putting one&#x27;s fellow human to shame is in the same category as murder and at one point describes slander, talebearing, and evil talk as worse than the three cardinal sins of murder, immorality, and idolatry. The spreading of evil reports, even when true, is branded as a calumny. Listening to slanderous gossip, or the causing of suspicion, or the provoking of unfavorable remarks about a neighbor is also forbidden.

One commandment in the Torah is to use one&#x27;s speech to correct, admonish, or reprove others (Leviticus 19:17). Some Jews have explained this as a matter of &quot;giving musar&quot; (discipline, instruction) in line with a verse from Proverbs 1:8: &quot;Hear, my child, the discipline (musar) of your father, and do not forsake the teachings of your mother.&quot; Some rabbis have emphasized the importance of what to say when giving musar, to whom one should speak, and when (how often) one should &quot;give musar&quot;. One suggestion from the late Rabbi Yisroel Belsky is that when there is a need to give musar to a friend: &quot;Give musar as a friend.&quot; Some &quot;musar&quot; is on topics that are a major part of everyday life, such as consoling mourners and visiting the sick. Rabbi Shimon Schwab taught that although &quot;[at times] you must &quot;give&quot; musar&quot; the command to do so (Lev. 19:17) is followed by &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; and that &quot;if you want ..(someone).. to change, (it must be) &quot;done through love.&quot;&quot;

===Jewish family ethics===

The Jewish tradition gives great stress to reverence for parents. More Orthodox forms of Judaism view the father as the head of the family, while seeing the mother as entitled to honor and respect at the hands of sons and daughters. More liberal Jews view the mother and father as equal in all things.

The family plays a central role in Judaism, both socially and in transmitting the traditions of the religion. To honor one&#x27;s father and mother is one of the Ten Commandments. Jewish families try to have close, respectful family relationships, with care for both the elderly and the young. Religious observance is an integral part of home life, including the weekly Sabbath and keeping kosher dietary laws. The Talmud tells parents to teach their children a trade and survival skills, and children are asked to look after their parents.

===Marriage and sexual relations===

Marriage is called &quot;kiddushin&quot;, or &#x27;making holy&#x27;, often understood as meaning that it is an institution imbued with holiness. Monogamy is widely seen as the ideal. Celibacy is regarded as contrary to the injunction to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 2:18 and Isaiah 45:18). According to the Talmud and midrash, man is enjoined to take a wife and obtain posterity. &quot;He who lives without a wife lives without joy and blessing, without protection and peace&quot;; he is &quot;not a complete man&quot;, and for it, he has to give reckoning at the great Judgement Day.

Orthodox rabbis almost universally oppose sex before marriage, whereas some non-Orthodox rabbis see sex before marriage as permissible. 

The laws of niddah prohibit sexual relations during the time of a woman&#x27;s period. After her period has ended, a woman is expected to fully immerse herself in a mikveh (the ritual immersion pool), entering a state of ritual purity. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during the &quot;niddah&quot; period, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship. Most non-Orthodox Jews have rejected these laws regarding abstinence during menstruation.

Orthodox Jews view male homosexuality as explicitly prohibited by the Torah, but other Jews view various forms of homosexual behavior or all forms of homosexual behavior as permitted by the tradition.

In Judaism, extramarital sex is widely frowned upon. Jewish ethics across denominations agrees that adultery and incestual relationships (Leviticus 18:6–23) are prohibited.

===Medical ethics and bioethics===

Jewish medical ethics is one of the major spheres of contemporary Jewish ethics. Beginning primarily as an applied ethics based on halakhah, more recently it has broadened to bioethics, weaving together issues in biology, science, medicine and ethics, philosophy and theology. Jewish bioethicists are usually rabbis who have been trained in medical science and philosophy, but may also be experts in medicine and ethics who have received training in Jewish texts. The goal of Jewish medical ethics and bioethics is to use Jewish law and tradition and Jewish ethical thought to determine which medical treatments or technological innovations are moral, when treatments may or may not be used, etc.

===Political governance===

The ethics of proper governance is the subject of much contention among Jews. Various models of political authority are developed in the Hebrew Bible, rabbinic literature, and later Jewish literature. Many prominent Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, see monarchy as a moral ideal, while others, such as Abravanel, disparage the model of the monarchy. Modern Jews have championed a variety of Jewish political movements, often based on their conceptions of Jewish ethics.

===Ethics of warfare===

Jewish war ethics are developed by Maimonides in his &quot;Laws of Kings and their Wars&quot;, part of his Mishneh Torah, where he treats on both a Mandatory war and a Voluntary war. Modern Jewish war ethics have been developed especially in relation to the Israeli military&#x27;s doctrine of purity of arms.

===Capital punishment===

The Jewish Bible says murderers should be executed but even in ancient times Jewish leaders were hostile to capital punishment, and the Talmud requires conditions for application of the death penalty so extremely stringent that the death penalty became effectively impossible.

===Relationship to non-Jews===

Jews widely believe that non-Jews who follow the seven laws of Noah will be equally recognized by God. According to rabbinic interpretation of Genesis 2:6 and 9:4, the laws of the Noachide code are: do not commit idolatry; do not blaspheme God; do not murder; do not steal; do not commit adultery; do not eat meat cut from a living animal; and establish courts of justice.

The principle of Kiddush Hashem requires Jews to conduct themselves in every way as to prevent the name of God from being dishonored by non-Israelites. The greatest sin of fraud, therefore, is that committed against a non-Israelite, because it may lead to the reviling of God&#x27;s name. A desire to sanctify the name of God may help to motivate some Jews to treat adherents of other creeds with the utmost fairness and equity.

Classical sources teach that Jews must support the non-Jewish poor, bury the non-Jewish dead, comfort the non-Jewish mourner, and visit the non-Jewish sick.

Exhortations to love the stranger &quot;as yourself&quot; (Ex. 22:20; Lev. 19:33) and &quot;Remember the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt&quot; (Deuteronomy 10:19), have an important role in many forms of Jewish ethics.

===Treatment of animals===
According to Jewish tradition, animals have a right to be treated well, even ones that might belong to one&#x27;s enemy. The Biblical commands regarding the treatment of animals are amplified in rabbinical ethics, and a special term is coined for the prohibition on causing suffering to animals (&quot;tza&#x27;ar ba&#x27;alei hayyim&quot;). Not to sit down to the table before the domestic animals have been fed is a lesson derived from Deuteronomy 11:15. Compassion for animals is declared to have been the merit of Moses which made him the shepherd of his people, while Judah ha-Nasi saw in his own ailment the punishment for having once failed to show compassion for a frightened calf.

Consideration for animals is an important part of Judaism. It is part of the Noachide code. Resting on the Sabbath also meant providing rest for the working animals, and people are instructed to feed their animals before they sit down to eat. At harvest time, the working animals must not be muzzled, so that they can eat of the harvest as they work. All animals must be kept in adequate conditions. Sports like bullfighting are forbidden. Animals may be eaten as long as they are killed using shechitah, a method where the animal has its throat cut using a specially sharpened knife. Jewish butchers are trained in this method which must meet the requirements of kashrut.

Enforcing laws regarding the treatment of animals in the certification of food products has been part of the effort of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Hekhsher Tzedek commission.

In modern times, a Jewish vegetarian movement has emerged, led by Jews who believe that Jewish ethics demands vegetarianism or veganism.

===Environmental ethics===

The Book of Genesis 1:26 indicates that God gave people control over the animals and earth, while Genesis 2:15 emphasizes that people were put in the world to maintain it and care for it. The Talmud teaches the principle of Bal tashkhit, which some take to mean that wasting or destroying anything on earth is wrong. Many take the view that pollution is an insult to the created world, and it is considered immoral to put commercial concerns before care for God&#x27;s creation. However, humans are regarded as having a special place in the created order, and their well-being is paramount. Humans are not seen as just another part of the ecosystem, so moral decisions about environmental issues have to take account of the well-being of humans.

Trees and other things of value also come within the scope of rabbinical ethics, as their destruction is prohibited, according to Deut. 20:19 as understood by the Babylonian Talmud. In modern times, a Jewish environmentalist movement has emerged, led by Jews who believe that Jewish ethics demands environmentalism.

<text>Kenneth Eugene St. Andre (born April 28, 1947) is an American fantasy game designer and author, best known for creating the fantasy role-playing game, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; (T&amp;T), and the computer role-playing game, &quot;Wasteland&quot;.

In 1975, St. Andre wrote rules for a fantasy role-playing game he called &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; (T&amp;T) as a rebellion against the recently published &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; which he felt was heavily dependent on the use of miniatures, with which he had no experience. In the following decades he published several editions of, and adventures for, T&amp;T, including rules and adventures for a monsters-as-heroes variation named &quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot; (M!M!).

St. Andre maintained a 40+ year long professional partnership with Rick Loomis, founder of game publisher Flying Buffalo, which published various &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; editions and products starting in 1975 and until Flying Buffalo&#x27;s sale in 2021. He continues to write fiction and gaming materials published under the Trollhalla Press Unlimited imprint, for items produced with his game design partner and artist Steve Crompton, and under the Trollgodfather Press imprint, for everything else St. Andre publishes.

St. Andre has been an active member of &quot;The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America&quot; since 1989. In June 2018, The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design inducted St. Andre into its Hall of Fame.

Ken St. Andre married once and has two children. He currently lives in Sun City, Arizona.

==Game design==

Ken St. Andre first saw the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game in April 1975, and after concluding that the rules did not make sense, he designed his own simpler game. St. Andre ultimately called his game &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;, and printed 100 copies of the first edition in 1975. He asked Rick Loomis of Flying Buffalo to sell 40 copies of &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; at Origins in July 1975. When those copies sold out, Flying Buffalo acquired the publishing rights to the game and published St. Andre&#x27;s second edition of T&amp;T in December 1975. In addition to writing the game rules, Ken was one of the creators of solitaire adventures which allowed players to experience the game without a game master or judge. St. Andre has written many modules and stand alone adventures for Tunnels &amp; Trolls, including the gamebooks &quot;Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Naked Doom&quot; in 1977 after Loomis&#x27;s own &quot;Buffalo Castle&quot;.

Flying Buffalo published several editions of T&amp;T throughout the years, all written by St. Andre, including 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 5.5th editions between 1975 and 2005. Fiery Dragon Productions published a 30th anniversary 7th edition and 7.5th editions in 2005 and 2008, respectively, skipping an official 6th edition due to controversy surrounding a fan-made, self-proclaimed 6th edition. St. Andre collaborated with an independent French publisher on an 8th edition in 2012. In 2015 Flying Buffalo released a Kickstarter-funded Deluxe Edition of T&amp;T, authored by St. Andre, Steve Crompton, Elizabeth Danforth and James &quot;Bear&quot; Peters, known as &quot;The Fellowship of the Troll&quot;. As of 2024, Deluxe T&amp;T stands as the latest edition of T&amp;T published.

St. Andre designed &quot;Starfaring&quot;, published by Flying Buffalo in 1976 as the first science fiction role-playing game ever published.

His third game, &quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot;, was published by Metagaming Concepts in 1976; Flying Buffalo acquired the rights to publish a second printing in 1979, although St. Andre maintained ownership of the game.

Following the death of Rick Loomis in 2019, St. Andre released a 2nd edition of &quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot; with expanded rules along with an updated &quot;The Toughest Dungeon in the World&quot; adventure module, both published by Trollhalla Press Unlimited in 2020. St. Andre&#x27;s aim was to separate M!M! from its parent game, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot;. After the sale of Flying Buffalo and &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; to Webbed Sphere in 2021, St. Andre moved the stories and characters still under his control to a new world named Zimrala with the release of &quot;Ken St. Andre&#x27;s Monsterary of Zimrala&quot; in 2022. In 2023 he published an expanded 2.7th edition of &quot;Monsters! Monsters!&quot;, which moved the setting firmly into Zimrala.

He designed Chaosium&#x27;s first licensed role-playing game, &quot;Stormbringer&quot;, in 1981, and helped create its 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions.

With Liz Danforth and Michael Stackpole, St. Andre designed the post-apocalyptic computer role-playing game &quot;Wasteland&quot;, a game published by Interplay in 1988. He rejoined Danforth and Stackpole as part of the design team of Wasteland 2, released in 2014.

==Awards and honors==
In 1986, Ken was the first editor for a fan club newsletter based around the &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot; video game, one of the rare cases of a professional designer leading gamer activities for another designer&#x27;s game.

St. Andre was chosen by vote as a &quot;famous game designer&quot; to be featured as the king of spades in Flying Buffalo&#x27;s 2014 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.

In June 2018, The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design inducted St. Andre into its Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
St. Andre currently lives in Sun City. He previously lived in Phoenix, Arizona. He has two children, a daughter, Jillian, and a son, James. On August 27, 2010, St. Andre retired after 36 years of service to the city of Phoenix as a public librarian.
