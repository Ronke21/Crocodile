<text>The corn crake, corncrake or landrail (Crex crex) is a bird in the rail family. It breeds in Europe and Asia as far east as western China, and migrates to Africa for the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter. It is a medium-sized crake with buff- or grey-streaked brownish-black upperparts, chestnut markings on the wings, and blue-grey underparts with rust-coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults, and downy chicks are black, as with all rails. There are no subspecies, although individuals from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts. The male&#x27;s call is a loud &quot;krek krek&quot;, from which the scientific name is derived. The corn crake is larger than its closest relative, the African crake, which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face.

The corn crake&#x27;s breeding habitat is grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds a nest of grass leaves in a hollow in the ground and lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Threats include dogs, cats, other introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.

Although numbers have declined steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.

==Taxonomy==
The rails are a bird family comprising nearly 150 species. Although the origins of the group are lost in antiquity, the largest number of species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake, which has been given its own genus, &quot;Crecopsis&quot;.

Corn crakes were first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Rallus crex&quot;, but was subsequently moved to the genus &quot;Crex&quot;, created by German naturalist and ornithologist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1803, and named &quot;Crex pratensis&quot;. The earlier use of &quot;crex&quot; gives it priority over Bechstein&#x27;s specific name &quot;pratensis&quot;, and leads to the current name of &quot;Crex crex&quot;. The binomial name, &quot;Crex crex&quot;, from the ancient Greek &quot;κρεξ&quot;, is onomatopoeic, referring to the crake&#x27;s repetitive grating call. The common name was formerly spelt as a single word, &quot;corncrake&quot;, but the official version is now &quot;corn crake&quot;. The English names refer to the species&#x27; habit of nesting in dry hay or cereal fields, rather than marshes used by most members of this family.

==Description==
The corn crake is a medium-sized rail, long with a wingspan of . Males weigh on average and females . The adult male has the crown of its head and all of its upperparts brown-black in colour, streaked with buff or grey. The wing coverts are a distinctive chestnut colour with some white bars. The face, neck and breast are blue-grey, apart from a pale brown streak from the base of the bill to behind the eye, the belly is white, and the flanks, and undertail are barred with chestnut and white. The strong bill is flesh-coloured, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Compared to the male, the female has warmer-toned upperparts and a narrower duller eye streak. Outside the breeding season, the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey. The juvenile is like the adult in appearance, but has a yellow tone to its upperparts, and the grey of the underparts is replaced with buff-brown. The chicks have black down, as with all rails. While there are no subspecies, all populations show great individual variation in colouring, and the birds gradually become paler and greyer towards the east of the range. Adults undergo a complete moult after breeding, which is normally finished by late August or early September, before migration to south eastern Africa. There is a pre-breeding partial moult prior to the return from Africa, mainly involving the plumage of the head, body and tail. Young birds have a head and body moult about five weeks after hatching.

The corn crake is sympatric with the African crake on the wintering grounds, but can be distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing. In both the breeding and wintering ranges it is unlikely to be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.

===Voice===

On the breeding grounds, the male corn crake&#x27;s advertising call is a loud, repetitive, grating &quot;&quot; normally delivered from a low perch with the bird&#x27;s head and neck almost vertical and its bill wide open. The call can be heard from away, and serves to establish the breeding territory, attract females, and challenge intruding males. Slight differences in vocalisations mean that individual males can be distinguished by their calls. Early in the season, the call is given almost continuously at night, and often during the day, too. It may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3 am. The call has evolved to make a singing male&#x27;s location clear, as this species hides in vegetation. The frequency of calling reduces after a few weeks but may intensify again near the end of the laying period before falling away towards the end of the breeding season. To attract males, mechanical imitations of their call can be produced by rubbing two pieces of wood or ribs, one of them with notches, or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip-fastener. The male also has a growling call, given with the bill shut and used during aggressive interactions.

The female corn crake may give a call that is similar to that of the male; it also has a distinctive barking sound, similar in rhythm to the main call but without the grating quality. The female also has a high-pitched cheep call, and a &#x27; sound to call the chick. The chicks make a quiet &#x27; contact call, and a chirp used to beg for food. Because of the difficulty in seeing this species, it is usually censused by counting males calling between 11 pm and 3 am; the birds do not move much at night, whereas they may wander up to during the day, which could lead to double-counting if monitored then. Identifying individual males suggests that just counting calling birds underestimates the true count by nearly 30%, and the discrepancy is likely to be greater, since only 80% of males may call at all on a given night. The corn crake is silent in Africa.

==Distribution and habitat==

The corn crake breeds from Ireland east through Europe to central Siberia. Although it has vanished from much of its historic range, this bird was once found in suitable habitats in Eurasia everywhere between latitudes 41°N and 62°N. There is also a sizable population in western China, but this species nests only rarely in northern Spain and in Turkey. Old claims of breeding in South Africa are incorrect, and result from misidentification of eggs in a museum collection which are actually those of the African rail.

The corn crake winters mainly in Africa, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa. North of this area, it is mainly seen on migration, but occasionally winters in North Africa and to the west and north of its core area in southeast Africa. Most of the South African population of about 2,000 birds occurs in KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province, and numbers elsewhere in Africa are uncertain. There are several nineteenth-century records, when populations were much higher than now, of birds being seen in western Europe, mainly Britain and Ireland, between December and February.

This crake migrates to Africa along two main routes: a western route through Morocco and Algeria, and a more important flyway through Egypt. On passage, it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of West Africa. Birds from Coll following the western route paused in West Africa on their way further south, and again on the return flight, when they also rested in Spain or North Africa. Eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further afield, the corn crake has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, New Zealand, the Seychelles, Bermuda, Canada, the US, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroes, the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands.

The corn crake is mainly a lowland species, but breeds up to altitude in the Alps, in China and in Russia. When breeding in Eurasia, the corn crake&#x27;s habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants including sedges and irises. It is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay, particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use. It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga, on coasts, or where created by fire. Moister areas like wetland edges may be used, but very wet habitats are avoided, as are open areas and those with vegetation more than tall, or too dense to walk through. The odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post. Grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting, but locally-grown crops such as cereals, peas, rape, clover or potatoes may be used. After breeding, adults move to taller vegetation such as common reed, iris, or nettles to moult, returning to the hay and silage meadows for the second brood. In China, flax is also used for nest sites. Although males often sing in intensively managed grass or cereal crops, successful breeding is uncommon, and nests in the field margins or nearby fallow ground are more likely to succeed.

When wintering in Africa, the corn crake occupies dry grassland and savanna habitats, occurring in vegetation tall, including seasonally burnt areas and occasionally sedges or reed beds. It is also found on fallow and abandoned fields, uncut grass on airfields, and the edges of crops. It occurs at up to at least altitude in South Africa. Each bird stays within a fairly small area. Although it sometimes occurs with the African crake, that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake. On migration, the corn crake may also occur in wheatfields and around golf courses.

==Behaviour==

The corn crake is a difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so than that of the African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.

The corn crake is solitary on the wintering grounds, where each bird occupies at one time, although the total area used may be double that, since an individual may move locally due to flooding, plant growth, or grass cutting. Flocks of up to 40 birds may form on migration, sometimes associating with common quails. Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults. Chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.

===Breeding===
Until 1995, it was assumed that the corn crake is monogamous, but it transpires that a male may have a shifting home range, and mate with two or more females, moving on when laying is almost complete. The male&#x27;s territory can vary from , but averages . The female has a much smaller range, averaging only . A male will challenge an intruder by calling with his wings drooped and his head pointing forward. Usually the stranger moves off; if it stays, the two birds square up with heads and necks raised and the wings touching the ground. They then run around giving the growling call and lunging at each other. A real fight may ensue, with the birds leaping at each other and pecking, and sometimes kicking. Females play no part in defending the territory.

The female may be offered food by the male during courtship. He has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.

The nest is in diameter and deep. The clutch is 6–14, usually 8–12 eggs; these are oval, slightly glossy, creamy or tinted with green, blue or grey, and blotched red-brown. They average and weigh about , of which 7% is shell. The eggs are laid at daily intervals, but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day. Incubation is by the female only; her tendency to sit tight when disturbed, or wait until the last moment to flee, leads to many deaths during hay-cutting and harvesting. The eggs hatch together after 19–20 days, and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two. They are fed by the female for three or four days, but can find their own food thereafter. The juveniles fledge after 34–38 days. The second brood is started about 42 days after the first, and the incubation period is slightly shorter at 16–18 days. The grown young may stay with the female until departure for Africa.

Nest success in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method and timing of mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.

===Feeding===
The corn crake is omnivorous, but mainly feeds on invertebrates, including earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. In the breeding areas, it is a predator of &quot;Sitona&quot; weevils, which infest legume crops. and in the past consumed large amounts of the former grassland pests, leatherjackets and wireworms. This crake will also eat small frogs and mammals, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Its diet on the wintering grounds is generally similar, but includes locally available items such as termites, cockroaches and dung beetles. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. Hunting is normally in cover, but, particularly in the wintering areas, it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food, and when fully grown they may fly with the parents up to to visit supplementary feeding areas. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.

==Predators and parasites==
Predators on the breeding grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, weasels, rats, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk.

The widespread fluke &quot;Prosthogonimus ovatus&quot;, which lives in the oviducts of birds, has been recorded in the corn crake, as have the parasitic worm &quot;Plagiorchis elegans&quot;, the larvae of parasitic flies, and hard ticks of the genera &quot;Haemaphysalis&quot; and &quot;Ixodes&quot;.

During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find the source of the bacteria in their environment.

==Status==
Until 2010, despite a breeding range estimated at , the corn crake was classified as near threatened on the IUCN Red List because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased. It is therefore now classed as least concern, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term. There are an estimated 1.3–2.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters of which are in European Russia, and a further 515,000–1,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals. In much of the western half of its range, there have been long-term declines that are expected to continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including a five-fold increase in Finland, and a doubling in the UK. In the Netherlands, there were 33 breeding territories in 1996, but this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998.

The breeding corn crake population had begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.

Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced suitability of drained and fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This bird is edible; when they were common in England, Mrs Beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer. More significant than direct hunting is the loss of many birds, up to 14,000 a year, in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.

Most European countries have taken steps to conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies; there is also an overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake. The corn crake does not appear to be seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.

==In culture==
Most rails are secretive wetland birds that have made little cultural impression, but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers, the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature.

===Names===

The favoured name for this species among naturalists has changed over the years, with &quot;landrail&quot; and variants of &quot;corncrake&quot; being preferred at various times. &quot;Crake gallinule&quot; also had a period of popularity between 1768 and 1813. The originally Older Scots &quot;cornecrake&quot; was popularised by Thomas Bewick, who used this term in his 1797 &quot;A History of British Birds&quot;. Other Scots names include &quot;corn scrack&quot; and &quot;quailzie&quot;; the latter term, like &quot;king of the quail&quot;, &quot;grass quail&quot;, the French &quot;&quot;roi de caille&quot;, and the German &quot;Wachtelkönig&quot;&quot; refer to the association with the small gamebird. Another name, &quot;daker&quot;, has been variously interpreted as onomatopoeic, or derived from the Old Norse &quot;ager-hoene&quot;, meaning &quot;cock of the field&quot;; variants include &quot;drake&quot;, &quot;drake Hen&quot; and &quot;gorse drake&quot;.

===In literature===
Corn crakes are the subject of three stanzas of the seventeenth century poet Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &quot;Upon Appleton House&quot;, written in 1651 about the North Yorkshire country estate of Thomas Fairfax. The narrator depicts the scene of a mower cutting the grass, before his &quot;whistling Sithe&quot; unknowingly &quot;carves the Rail&quot;. The farmhand draws out the scythe &quot;all bloody from its breast&quot; and &quot;does the stroke detest&quot;. It continues with a stanza that demonstrates the problematic nature of the corn crake&#x27;s nesting habits:
&lt;poem&gt;
Unhappy Birds! What does it boot
To build below the Grass&#x27; Root;
When Lowness is unsafe as Hight,
And Chance o&#x27;ertakes, what scapeth spight?
&lt;/poem&gt;

John Clare, the nineteenth-century English poet based in Northamptonshire, wrote &quot;The Landrail&quot;, a semi-comic piece which is primarily about the difficulty of seeing corn crakes – as opposed to hearing them. In the fourth verse he exclaims: &quot;Tis like a fancy everywhere/A sort of living doubt&quot;. Clare wrote about corn crakes in his prose works too, and his writings help to clarify the distribution of this rail when it was far more widespread than now.

The Finnish poet Eino Leino also wrote about the bird in his poem &quot;Nocturne&quot;.
&lt;poem&gt;
The corncrake&#x27;s song rings in my ears,
above the rye a full moon sails
&lt;/poem&gt;

The proverbial use of the corn crake&#x27;s call to describe someone with a grating or unmelodious voice is illustrated in the quotation &quot;thanks to a wee woman with a voice like a corncrake who believed she was an apprentice angel&quot;. This usage dates from at least the first half of the nineteenth century, and continues through to the present.

===In music===

In The Pogues &quot;Lullaby of London&quot; Shane MacGowan uses the corncrake&#x27;s cry as a motif to illustrate his alienation in the city, he sings:
&lt;poem&gt;
Though there is no lonesome corncrake&#x27;s cry
Of sorrow and delight
You can hear the cars
And the shouts from bars
And the laughter and the fights
&lt;/poem&gt;

In The Decemberists &quot;The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All)&quot; Colin Meloy references the corn crake&#x27;s call, singing: &quot;And we&#x27;ll lie until the corn crake crows.&quot;

<text>Cabaret Voltaire is the birthplace of the Dada art movement, founded in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1916. It was founded by Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings as a cabaret intended for artistic and political purposes.

Other founding members were Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Tristan Tzara, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Jean Arp.

It is currently operating as a museum, bar and cultural space open to the public, at Spiegelgasse 1, 8001 Zurich, Switzerland.

==Significance==
The cabaret was founded at the Holländische Meierei, Spiegelgasse 1, in Zurich, Switzerland on February 5, 1916. It proved pivotal in the founding of the anarchic art movement known as Dada.

&quot;If one seeks a dictionary now to explain the word &#x27;Dada,&#x27; one will discover it has a clear definition. Yet, no one can describe exactly that feeling of rebellion, hidden behind suspicion and the desire to do what the troupe was passionate about at the time.&quot;

In 2013, the Cabaret Voltaire performances were ranked as the 25th best work of performance art in history.

Cabaret Voltaire closed in the summer of 1916, but the Cabaret was revived in the same building in the 21st century. Salome Hohl is the current artistic director and director.

==History==

Switzerland was a neutral country during World War I and among the many refugees coming to Zurich were artists from all over Europe. Ball and Hennings approached Ephraim Jan, patron of the &quot;Holländische Meierei&quot; at Spiegelgasse 1, which had already hosted Zurich&#x27;s first literary cabaret, the &quot;Pantagruel&quot; in 1915. Jan permitted them to use the back room for events. The press release on 2 February 1916 announcing the opening of the club reads:
The Cabaret Voltaire. Under this name a group of young artists and writers has formed with the object of becoming a center for artistic entertainment. In principle, the Cabaret will be run by artists, permanent guests, who, following their daily reunions, will give musical or literary performances. Young Zurich artists, of all tendencies, are invited to join us with suggestions and proposals.

The cabaret featured spoken word, dance and music. The soirees were often raucous events with artists experimenting with new forms of performance, such as sound poetry and simultaneous poetry. Mirroring the maelstrom of World War I raging around it, the art it exhibited was often chaotic and brutal. On at least one occasion, the audience attacked the cabaret&#x27;s stage. Though the cabaret was to be the birthplace of the Dadaist movement, it featured artists from every sector of the avant-garde, including Futurism&#x27;s Marinetti. The cabaret exhibited radically experimental artists, many of whom went on to change the face of their artistic disciplines; featured artists included Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Giorgio de Chirico, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and Max Ernst.

On 28 July 1916, Ball read out his &quot;Dada Manifesto&quot;. In June, Ball had also published a journal with the same name. It featured work from artists such as the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, and had a cover designed by Arp.

The cabaret closed in the summer of 1916.

While the Dada movement was just beginning, by 1917 the excitement generated by Cabaret Voltaire had fizzled out, and the artists moved on to other places in Zurich such as the Galerie Dada at Bahnhofstrasse 19, and later Paris and Berlin.

===21st century revival===

After the turn of the millennium, the building which had housed Cabaret Voltaire in 1916 had fallen into disrepair, and in the winter of 2001/2002 a group of artists describing themselves as neo-Dadaists, organised by Mark Divo, squatted the building to protest its planned closure. They declared that it was a signal for a new generation of artists to align themselves with a revival of Dada.

Over a period of three months there was a number of performances, parties, poetry evenings and film nights. Among the participating artists were Ingo Giezendanner, Lennie Lee, Leumund Cult, Mickry3, xeno volcano, elektra sturmschnell, Aiana Calugar, and Dan Jones. The building was decorated on the outside as well as the inside. Thousands of people from around Zurich took part in the experiment. On April 2, 2002 police evicted the occupants.

A new cabaret has since opened in the building, with an extensive programme of events such as, &quot;Hugo Ball: Fuga saeculi,&quot; in 2008, curated by Bazon Brock and included a performance of Gabriella Daris&#x27;s corporeal poem &quot;LopLop: WORD or WOman biRD&quot; (an homage to Max Ernst&#x27;s namesake collage from 1921) as well as a film projection by Werner Nekes&quot;,&quot; and the 2008 exhibition &quot;Dreamachine: David Woodard, Sheela Birnstiel, Christian Kracht.&quot;

More recently, Cabaret Voltaire has adopted personalities and celebrated them as Dadaists, such as Alexander Archipenko, Tatsuo Okada and Mikhail Bakunin. Cabaret Voltaire sponsored the restoration of Bakunin&#x27;s grave plate in the Bremgarten cemetery in Bern, adding a portrait by Swiss artist Daniel Garbade and the Bakunin quote: &quot;By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is possible.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* The electronic band Cabaret Voltaire was named as so in reference to the club, drawing inspiration from Dadaism and incorporating it in their earliest albums.
* The novel &quot;What was Beautiful and Good&quot; by Jill Blocker follows the lives of Emmy Hennings and Hugo Ball during the early days of World War 1, Here, they struggle to find purpose amidst the chaos, which results in the creation of the Cabaret Voltaire.
* In 2020, the first season of the television show &quot;The Fugitive Game&quot;, which focusses on German poet Emmy Hennings, was filmed on location at Cabaret Voltaire.

<text>The western swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio) is a species of swamphen in the rail family Rallidae, one of the six species of purple swamphen. From the French name &quot;talève sultane&quot;, it is also known as the sultana bird. This chicken-sized bird, with its large feet, bright plumage and red bill and frontal shield is easily recognisable in its native range. It used to be considered the nominate subspecies of the purple swamphen, but is now recognised as a separate species. The western swamphen is found in wetlands in Spain (where the largest population lives), Portugal, southeastern France, Italy (Sardinia and Sicily) and northwestern Africa (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia).

==Taxonomy==
The western swamphen was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the coots in the genus &quot;Fulica&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fulica porphyrio&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;porphyrio&quot; is Latin for a swamphen. The word is from Ancient Greek πορφυριον (&quot;porphurion&quot;) meaning &quot;swamphen&quot; which in turn is from πορφυρα (&quot;porphura&quot;) meaning &quot;purple&quot;. The species had been described in 1678 by the English ornithologist Francis Willughby under that Latin name &quot;Porphyrio&quot; and English name &quot;purple water-hen&quot;. Linnaeas specified the type location as Asia, Africa but this has been restricted to the lands bordering the western Mediterranean. The western swamphen is now one of 12 species placed in the genus &quot;Porphyrio&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The western swamphen was formerly considered as the nominate subspecies in the purple swamphen species complex. The complex was split into six species based primarily on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015.

==Behaviour==
The species makes loud, quick, bleating and hooting calls which are hardly bird-like in tone. It is particularly noisy during the breeding season. Despite being clumsy in flight, it can fly long distances and is a good swimmer, especially for a bird without webbed feet.

===Breeding===
Western swamphens are generally seasonal breeders, correlating with peak rainfall in many places, or summer in more temperate climes. The purple swamphen breeds in warm reed beds. The pattern of social behaviour tends to be monogamy.

Pairs nest in a large pad of interwoven reed flags, etc., on a mass of floating debris or amongst matted reeds slightly above water level in swamps, clumps of rushes in paddocks or long unkempt grass. Each bird can lay 3–6 speckled eggs, pale yellowish stone to reddish buff, blotched and spotted with reddish brown. The incubation period is 23–27 days, and is performed by both sexes. The precocious chicks are feathered with downy black feathers and able to leave the nest soon after hatching, but will often remain in the nest for a few days. Young chicks are fed by their parents (and group members) for between 10–14 days, after which they begin to feed themselves.

===Food and feeding===
The western swamphen prefers wet areas with high rainfall, swamps, lake edges and damp pastures. The birds often live in pairs and larger communities. It clambers through the reeds, eating the tender shoots and vegetable-like matter. They have been known to eat eggs, ducklings, small fish and invertebrates such as snails. They have even been known to attack large eels; however, there is no consensus amongst ornithologists if they actually eat eel. They will often use one foot to bring food to their mouth rather than eat it on the ground. Where they are not persecuted, they can become tame and be readily seen in towns and cities.

==Relationship with humans==

===Ancient times===
Swamphens were often kept in captivity in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The behavior of the species was described in some detail by Aristotle in &quot;History of Animals&quot; (4th century BC), and they were also mentioned by Aristophanes (5th century BC), Pliny the Elder (1st century BC), Aelian and Athenaeus (2nd to 3rd century AD). Sources indicate that these birds typically were western swamphens (originating from the Balearic Islands, among others) or grey-headed swamphens (originating from Turkey), and the two were already distinguished by Pliny the Elder who considered the former superior. They typically were not kept for food, but instead were decorative birds in villas and temples. If raised in captivity, swamphens tend to become quite tame. There are many depictions of the species on Roman mosaics and frescos, typically in a natural or domestic environment, including the famous garden fresco from Pompeii. In early Christianity, it was also frequently depicted, but here symbolising the richness of life and often perched in the tree of life.

===Status and conservation===
Today the western swamphen is locally common, with the largest population in Spain. It was formerly listed as &quot;Rare&quot; by the European Union, but has been delisted to &quot;Localised&quot;.

The species declined drastically in the first half of the 20th century due to habitat loss and hunting. It was relatively widespread until 1900, but by the 1960s it was seriously threatened and its range in the Iberian Peninsula was limited to a few locations in the Guadalquivir basin. As a result of reintroduction schemes and protection of both the species and its habitat, the western swamphen has since recovered. By the 1990s it was locally common, and by 2000 its range in the Iberian Peninsula was similar to its range in 1900. The center is in Spain where the population increased from 600–900 breeding pairs in 1992 to 3500–4500 breeding pairs in 1999. From Spain it has continued its expansion into southeastern France where small numbers now breed. It remains rare and local in Portugal where there were 49–67 breeding pairs in 2002, but this population is also recovering. It was extirpated from Sicily in 1957, effectively restricting its Italian range to Sardinia where the population was 450–600 breeding pairs in 1999. Beginning in 2000, it was reintroduced to Sicily. A small &quot;purple swamphen&quot; population in central Italy is the result of grey-headed swamphens that escaped from a zoo.

Little is known about the status of the western swamphen in Africa, but northeastern Algeria is considered one of its strongholds in this region.

When protected, western swamphens are able to thrive in human-managed habitats, and in some places they live in paddy fields, resulting in conflicts with farmers as they can be destructive to the rice.

<text>Harvard Yard is the oldest and among the most prominent parts of the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The yard has a historic center and modern crossroads and contains most of the freshman dormitories, Harvard&#x27;s most important libraries, Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings, and the offices of senior university officials, including the President of Harvard University.

The Yard grew over the centuries around Harvard College&#x27;s first parcel of land, purchased in 1637.
Today it is a grassy area of bounded principally by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway, and Quincy Street. Its perimeter fencingprincipally iron, with some stretches of brickhas twenty-seven gates.

==Subdivisions==

The center of the Yard, known as Tercentenary Theatre, is a wide grassy area bounded by Widener Library, Memorial Church, University Hall, and Sever Hall. Tercentenary Theatre is the site of annual commencement exercises and other convocations.

The western third of Harvard Yard, which opens onto Peabody Street (often mistaken for nearby Massachusetts Avenue) at Johnston Gate and abuts the center of Harvard Square to the south, is known as the Old Yard. Most of the freshman dormitories cluster around the Old Yard, including Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard&#x27;s oldest building and the second-oldest academic building in the United States. Massachusetts Hall also houses the offices of the President of Harvard University.

The original Harvard Hall in the Old Yard housed the College library, including the books donated by John Harvardall but one of which were destroyed when the building burned in 1764. Rebuilt in 1766, the current Harvard Hall now houses classrooms.

Across the Old Yard from Johnston Gate is University Hall (1815), whose white-granite facade was the first to challenge the red-brick Georgian style until then ascendant; between its twin west staircases stands the John Harvard statue. University Hall contains major administrative offices, including those of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Dean of Harvard College.

==Buildings==
Libraries in the Yard are Widener Library, its connected Pusey Library annex, Houghton Library for rare books and manuscripts, and Lamont Library, the main undergraduate library. Classroom and departmental buildings include Emerson Hall, Sever Hall, Robinson Hall, and Boylston Hall. The Harvard Bixi, a Chinese stele with inscribed text, is located near Widener.

The freshman dormitories of Harvard Yard include the upper levels of Massachusetts Hall, and Wigglesworth Hall, Weld Hall, Grays Hall, Matthews Hall, Straus Hall, Mower Hall, Hollis Hall, Stoughton Hall, Lionel Hall, Holworthy Hall, Canaday Hall, and Thayer Hall.

Nestled among Mower, Hollis, Lionel, and Stoughton Halls is Holden Chapel, home of the Holden Choirs. Nearby is Phillips Brooks House, dedicated to student service to the community.

Administrative buildings in the Yard include the aforementioned University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; Loeb House, on the east side of the Yard; and Wadsworth House, on the south side. Loeb House is the home of Harvard&#x27;s governing bodies: the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers. Wadsworth House houses the Harvard University Librarian and the Office of the University Marshal, among others. Lehman Hall, at the southwestern corner of the Yard, provides administrative services for students who live off-campus.

<text>Philip Anthony Esposito ( , ; born February 20, 1942) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, coach and executive, and current broadcaster for the Tampa Bay Lightning. A member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, he played 18 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers, winning two Stanley Cups with Boston.

He is considered one of the greatest players of all time, and is the older brother of fellow Hall-of-Famer Tony Esposito, a goaltender. He became the first player to score more than 100 points in a season, with 126 in 1968–69, a feat he would later achieve a further 5 times, also becoming the first player to score 50 goals in a season 5 times in a row, including the then record of 76 goals in 1970–71 to go with the then record 152 points the same year. Altogether, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the leading point scorer five times, led the league in goals six times, was voted the Hart Trophy for MVP twice, and was named as a first team All-Star centre six times.

After retiring as a player, Esposito served as head coach and general manager for the Rangers for two seasons. In 1991, he and his younger brother co-founded the Tampa Bay Lightning, the first NHL team in Florida. The elder Esposito served as the franchise&#x27;s first president and general manager until 1998; he now serves as Tampa Bay&#x27;s radio colour commentator.

Esposito was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history in 2017, and the ninth-best player of all-time by &quot;The Athletic&quot; in 2023. His #7 jersey was retired by the Bruins on December 3, 1987, and there is a statue in his likeness at Tampa Bay&#x27;s Amalie Arena.

==Playing career==

===Minor league===
Esposito signed with the Chicago Black Hawks as a teenager and was assigned to the Sarnia Legionnaires Jr. &#x27;B&#x27; hockey team for the 1960–61 season. In just 32 games with the Legionnaires, he scored 47 goals and 61 assists, for 108 points - a scoring pace of 3.3 points per game. He scored 12 points in one playoff game as the Legionnaires advanced to the Western Ontario final before being eliminated.
After a sparkling junior season with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey Association in 1962, Esposito spent two seasons with Chicago&#x27;s minor league affiliate, the St. Louis Braves, scoring 90 points in his first season and 80 points in only 46 games in his second.

===Chicago Black Hawks===
Midway through the 1964 season, Esposito was called up to the parent Black Hawks to make his NHL debut. Centreing for the great Bobby Hull beginning in the 1965 season, he proved himself a quality playmaker, twice finishing amongst the League-leading scorers over the next three seasons.

===Boston Bruins===

In 1967, Esposito was dealt with Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield to the Boston Bruins in a blockbuster trade. While Hodge and Stanfield rose to become stars in Boston, Esposito blossomed into the greatest scorer of his day. In 1969, he became the first NHL player to score 100 points in a season, far eclipsing the &quot;century&quot; mark with a record 126. He would fall a single point shy in 1970, then reached triple digits again the next five years running. Along the way, he captured the Art Ross Trophy as the top regular-season scorer in 1969 and 1971 to 1974, and led the League in goals six straight seasons between 1969–70 and 1974–75.

Esposito was named to the NHL&#x27;s first All-Star team six consecutive times (from 1969 to 1974), and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player in 1969 and 1974. His Boston fans, celebrating his scoring touch during his heyday, displayed bumper stickers that read, &quot;Jesus saves, Espo scores on the rebound.&quot; Esposito, while not a fast or graceful skater, was best known for his unmovable presence in front of the opposition net from which he could score from all angles. Esposito has said, &quot;Scoring is easy. You simply stand in the slot, take your beating and shoot the puck into the net.&quot; He also possessed a combination of skating and stickhandling ability, strength, and long reach that enabled him to &quot;rag the puck,&quot; holding onto it for long periods of time in the face of opponents&#x27; checks and thus enabling his team to kill off penalties.

During his prime, Esposito centred one of the most renowned forward lines in history, featuring Ken Hodge on his right wing and Wayne Cashman on his left. Esposito and fellow superstar Bobby Orr led the Bruins to Stanley Cup victories in 1970 and 1972, and first-place finishes in the League in 1971, 1972 and 1974.

During 1970–71, Esposito shattered the record for most goals in a season, finishing with 76. The mark stood until 1982, when Wayne Gretzky scored his 77th, 78th and 79th goals against the Buffalo Sabres on February 24, 1982, at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Esposito was on hand to present the game puck to Gretzky. Esposito also set the single-season point-scoring record in 1971 with 152, a mark later raised by Gretzky to 215. Only four others have reached the 150 point plateau — Mario Lemieux (4 times), Steve Yzerman, Bernie Nicholls and Connor McDavid — and only Gretzky, Lemieux, Brett Hull, Teemu Selänne and Alexander Mogilny have matched or bettered Esposito&#x27;s 76 goals in a season. The 1970 season also saw Esposito shatter the single-season mark for shots on goal, tallying 550. Only one other player has come within 100 shots of this record, Alexander Ovechkin in 2008–09, in a season that was four games longer than when it was set.

As of May 24, 2024, Esposito ranked second in all-time regular-season goals for Boston with 459 (behind only Johnny Bucyk&#x27;s 545). As of 2024, Esposito was fourth behind Brad Marchand, Cam Neely and Patrice Bergeron in all-time Bruins playoff goals with 46. Esposito holds the Boston record for most playoff hat-tricks with four, one of which was a four-goal game versus Toronto in 1969. Often used to kill penalties, Esposito scored 20 shorthanded goals for Boston over his career.

After his performance in the Summit Series, where he was the Captain and inspirational leader for Canada and its leading scorer in the series, Esposito won the 1972 Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s outstanding male athlete of the year and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He also scored the first goal of the series and he scored or assisted four times in the deciding game. During that series, his scolding of Canadian fans, who booed the national team after a 5–3 loss to the Soviet Union in Game Four, was credited with firing up his teammates:

&quot;If the Russian fans boo their players in Moscow like you people are booing us, I&#x27;ll come back and apologize personally to every one of you, but I really don&#x27;t think that will happen. We gave it and are doing our best. All of us guys are really disheartened. . . We came out here because we love Canada. They&#x27;re a good hockey team, and we don&#x27;t know what we could do better, but I promise we will figure it out. But it&#x27;s totally ridiculous – I don&#x27;t think it is fair that we should be booed.&quot;

Esposito also played for Canada in the inaugural Canada Cup in 1976, on a line with Hall-of-Famers Bobby Hull and Marcel Dionne. The following year, he would represent Canada once more in the 1977 World Championships in Vienna.

===New York Rangers===
In 1975–76, Esposito was traded because he did not want to relinquish his playing time, even with his age. He and Carol Vadnais were traded to the New York Rangers on November 7 in exchange for Brad Park, Joe Zanussi and Jean Ratelle. This trade was monumental, as Esposito was still a great scorer, but Ratelle was a skilled centre and Park was arguably the second best defenceman in the NHL, behind Bobby Orr.

While not as glittering an offensive force as in his glory days, as captain of the Rangers, Esposito led the team in points each of his full seasons with the club and remained an effective scorer until his final season. The highlight of his years in New York was leading the Rangers to the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals where, at 37 years of age, he finished third in postseason scoring.

On November 4, 1977, Esposito scored his 600th NHL goal, against the Vancouver Canucks in Vancouver, becoming the first player to reach that milestone in a Rangers uniform.

Esposito retired in 1981, behind only Gordie Howe in career goals and total points, and third in assists to Howe and Stan Mikita.

==Post-playing career==
===New York Rangers===
Esposito served as general manager and head coach of the Rangers from 1986 to 1989, during which he earned the nickname &quot;Trader Phil&quot; for the numerous transactions he made. During his tenure as GM, he made more trades than the Vancouver Canucks had made in the entire 1980s. While serving as GM, two of his most famous moves were the trade for the legendary Marcel Dionne and one in which he sent a first-round pick to the Quebec Nordiques as compensation for signing Michel Bergeron to be the Rangers&#x27; head coach.

===Tampa Bay Lightning===
====Founder and Manager====
When the NHL announced its expansion plans in the late 1980s, Phil Esposito, along with his brother Tony, and Mel Lowell, sought to place a franchise in Tampa Bay, Florida. They faced competition from the Compuware Group, which wanted to place a team in nearby St. Petersburg, Florida. It was proposed to Esposito that he merge his bid with the Compuware Group, which he refused. His reputation and force of personality was widely credited with winning the expansion bid for Tampa Bay on December 6, 1990. The Tampa Bay Lightning would start play in the 1992–93 NHL season, with the elder Esposito as the team&#x27;s first president and general manager.

For the Lightning&#x27;s inaugural season, Esposito hired many of his former teammates from the Bruins, including Cashman as an assistant coach and former Bruins trainer John &quot;Frosty&quot; Forristal as trainer. He also made hockey history by signing Manon Rhéaume, making her the first woman to sign with and play for an NHL team.

However, one of the Esposito group&#x27;s key backers, the Pritzker family, had backed out a few months before the bid, to be replaced by a Japanese consortium headed by Kokusai Green, a golf course and resort operator. Though Kokusai Green had helped the Espositos secure the initial bid, the team languished under their ownership; financed almost entirely by loans, the Lightning were constantly short of cash, hampering Esposito&#x27;s ability to function as GM. Kokusai Green&#x27;s owner, Takashi Okubo, never met with the Espositos (or with any other NHL officials), and it was rumored that the consortium was a criminal front for the yakuza. The Lightning quickly fell to the bottom of the league and Esposito fired head coach Terry Crisp in 1997. Even with interim coach Jacques Demers, who had enjoyed successful tenures with the Red Wings and Canadiens, the Lightning lost 55 games for a franchise-worst .268 winning percentage.

Kokusai Green sold the Lightning to insurance tycoon Art Williams in 1998. Shortly after taking control, Williams fired both Esposito brothers two games into the 1998–99 season.

====Broadcaster====
After he retired with the Rangers in 1981, he joined MSG Network/WWOR-TV for the 1981–82 season as a TV color commentator replacing Bill Chadwick. He called games alongside first with Jim Gordon and later Sam Rosen. In 1988, the pair called Wales Conference playoff games for ESPN.

After his firing, Esposito returned to the Lightning organization for the 1999–2000 season as a radio colour commentator. He still calls home games on WHPT (and previously, on WFLA), along with play-by-play commentator Dave Mishkin, with Bobby Taylor replacing him for away games. Esposito also co-hosts a daily call-in show on SiriusXM&#x27;s &quot;SiriusXM NHL Network Radio&quot; channel.

==Honours==
Esposito was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1984. On December 3, 1987, his #7 jersey was retired by the Boston Bruins in an emotional ceremony where the then-current wearer, superstar defenceman Ray Bourque, pulled off his #7 jersey to reveal his new number, 77—dramatically &quot;surrendering&quot; his old number in Esposito&#x27;s favour (coincidentally, Esposito wore #77 with the New York Rangers, because #7 was already being worn by Rod Gilbert). Esposito was &quot;visibly moved&quot; when Bourque showed the Boston Garden crowd his new number, which he used for the rest of his career. Esposito was also on hand in Boston to hand Bourque his retired number after the latter retired.

Esposito&#x27;s younger brother Tony is also an honoured member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Former NHL player Alexander Selivanov is Esposito&#x27;s son-in-law.

<doc id="320209" wikidata="Q897787" url="?curid=320209" title="Raisins (South Park)">
<text>&quot;Raisins&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;, and the 110th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 10, 2003. In the episode, Wendy breaks up with Stan, causing him to spiral into a deep depression. The boys, in an attempt to make him feel better, take him to Raisins, a parody of American restaurant chain Hooters. Meanwhile, Butters becomes infatuated with a waitress at Raisins.

The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. Though he and the show&#x27;s writing team had the concept of Raisins, it took several days to fully develop its story. They were unable to begin work on the episode until six days before its airdate. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone based Stan&#x27;s breakup on their memories of elementary school &quot;relationships&quot;, and the episode&#x27;s use of licensed music is also representative of their upbringing. &quot;Raisins&quot; is the first episode to include the Goth kids, secondary characters within the show&#x27;s universe. Stan and Wendy would later reconcile their relationship four years later in &quot;The List&quot;.

The episode received positive reviews from television critics. &quot;Raisins&quot; was released on DVD along with the rest of the seventh season in 2006.

The boys are playing football at recess when Bebe suddenly tells Stan that his girlfriend Wendy has decided to break up with him. Stan tells Bebe that he has not spoken to Wendy for weeks and also asks if he has done something wrong (technically answering his own question), to which Bebe replies that Wendy does not want to be with him anymore, much to Stan&#x27;s shock. Stan&#x27;s friends are unconcerned and make fun of Bebe, but Stan falls into a deep depression and decides not to play football with them.

His friends take him to the restaurant Raisins—where all of the employees are young preteen girls wearing heavy make-up, and are all named after luxury car brands—hoping to cheer him up. Later, Stan asks Bebe for help to get Wendy back. Bebe tells Stan to play a Peter Gabriel song loudly outside her house. However, when doing this, he discovers Wendy has already begun a relationship with Tolkien. Nothing will change Stan&#x27;s fortunes, and at Kyle&#x27;s suggestion, when Stan refuses to attend P.E. class, he decides to socialize with the South Park Elementary&#x27;s group of goth kids. He begins wearing dark clothes, consuming large amounts of coffee, and delving deeper into his sadness.

Meanwhile, Butters falls in love with a waitress at Raisins named Lexus, failing to see the insincerity of her interest in him. He obsesses over her and begins to spend all of his parents&#x27; money at the restaurant. Butters&#x27; parents, delighted that their son did not turn out gay, decide to come with Butters to meet his &quot;girlfriend&quot;, but discover she has been using him for money. Though they explain this to him, Butters tells his parents off. He reveals he has plans to move in with Lexus, who bluntly tells him that she was never his girlfriend. Butters becomes depressed, and the goth kids invite him to join their clique. He refuses, noting that though he is upset, he is happy he can feel sadness, as it makes him feel more alive. Stan adopts Butters&#x27; point of view and emerges from his own depression. The next day, he rejoins his friends for football and tells Kyle he will handle his future problems in &quot;the right way&quot;: by insulting his ex and her boyfriend.

==Production==

&quot;Raisins&quot; was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. Like many &quot;South Park&quot; episodes, it was produced in the week preceding its broadcast. The writers spent the first day of their production week, Thursday, without any ideas. They convened at Parker&#x27;s home the following day. Parker noted in the episode&#x27;s commentary that the crew at South Park Studios began getting nervous, as a day&#x27;s worth of animation work had been lost. They had developed the idea of Raisins—a parody of the restaurant chain Hooters but designed for younger girls—but were unable to build an episode around it. The team discussed that men often visit Hooters with friends to cheer them up following a breakup. This led to the concept of Wendy, one of the show&#x27;s secondary characters, breaking up with main character Stan. Co-creator Matt Stone noted the way in which Stan is broken up with in the episode is the way he remembered kids in elementary school going about relationships.

The episode introduces several recurring characters, among them the Raisins girls and the Goth kids. Parker wrote in the script that the character of Kyle offhandedly mentions the &quot;Goth kids&quot; in one line, but decided it would be fun to create new characters for them. The concept of the Goth kids drinking coffee at Benny&#x27;s (a spoof of American-based diner chain Denny&#x27;s) comes from Stone&#x27;s own experiences. He remembered the Goth kids from his adolescence hanging out at his local Perkins drinking endless cups of coffee for hours at a time. Parker&#x27;s favorite moment in the episode involves the character Jimmy, who has a speech impediment, telling Wendy that she is a &quot;continuing source of inspiration&quot; for Stan but stuttering on the first syllable, causing it to be misheard as &quot;cunt&quot;. Parker remembered the writers spent time attempting to come up with words they could use in that scenario; Stone dubbed the end result a &quot;reach of a joke.&quot;

==Cultural references==
The episode plays &quot;Don&#x27;t Know What You Got (Till It&#x27;s Gone)&quot; by Cinderella when Wendy breaks up with Stan. Parker remembered he and the crew were adamant that they license that particular song, as they considered it &quot;perfect&quot; for that moment. The episode further uses &quot;Living in America&quot; by James Brown, &quot;All Out of Love&quot; by Air Supply, &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; by Peter Gabriel, and &quot;YMCA&quot; by Village People. Parker and Stone noted that these songs were culled from their experiences growing up in the 1970s and 80s.

In the episode, Bebe tells Stan to try and win Wendy back by standing outside her window, holding up a boom box, and playing Peter Gabriel; a reference to the John Cusack film &quot;Say Anything...&quot;. However instead of playing &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; like in the movie, Stan plays &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;.

==Reception==
Tim Cain of the &quot;Herald &amp; Review&quot; considered Butters&#x27; speech at the episode&#x27;s conclusion &quot;one of the most heartful and sincere soliloquies in the show&#x27;s history&quot;, despite it not strictly being a soliloquy.

==Home release==
&quot;Raisins&quot;, along with the thirteen other episodes from &quot;South Park&quot;&#x27;s seventh season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on March 26, 2006. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection &quot;A Little Box of Butters&quot;.

<text>The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a -year-old tropical garden located at the fringe of the Orchard Road shopping district in Singapore. It is one of three gardens, and the only tropical garden, to be honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Botanic Gardens has been ranked Asia&#x27;s top park attraction since 2013, by TripAdvisor Travellers&#x27; Choice Awards. It was declared the inaugural Garden of the Year by the International Garden Tourism Awards in 2012.

The Botanic Gardens was founded at its present site in 1859 by the Agri-horticultural Society. It played a pivotal role in the region&#x27;s rubber trade boom in the early twentieth century when its first scientific director, Henry Nicholas Ridley, headed research into the plant&#x27;s cultivation. By perfecting the technique of rubber extraction, which is still in use today, and promoting its economic value to planters in the region, rubber output expanded rapidly. At its height in the 1920s, the Malayan peninsula cornered half of the global latex production.

The National Orchid Garden, which is located within the main gardens, is at the forefront of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids, complementing the nation&#x27;s status as a major exporter of cut orchids. Aided by the equatorial climate, it houses the largest orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids.

Soon after the nation&#x27;s independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens&#x27; expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical &quot;Garden City&quot;, an image and moniker for which the nation is widely known. In 1981, the hybrid climbing orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim, was chosen as the country&#x27;s national flower. Singapore&#x27;s &quot;orchid diplomacy&quot; honours visiting head of states, dignitaries, and celebrities by naming its finest hybrids after them; these are displayed at its popular VIP Orchid Gardens.

The Gardens is open from 5 a.m. to 12 midnight daily and entry is free, except for the National Orchid Garden. More than 10,000 species of flora are spread over its area, which is stretched vertically; the longest distance between the northern and southern ends is . The Botanic Gardens receives about 4.5 million visitors annually.

==History==

The first &quot;Botanical and Experimental Garden&quot; in Singapore was established in 1822 on Government Hill by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore and a keen naturalist. The Garden&#x27;s main task was to evaluate cultivation crops which were of potential economic importance, including those yielding fruits, vegetables, spices and other raw materials. This first Garden closed in 1829.

It was not until 30 years later that the present Singapore Botanic Gardens began in 1859, when the Singapore Agri-horticultural Society was granted 32 hectares of land in Tanglin by the colonial government, which had obtained it from the merchant Hoo Ah Kay, better known as Whampoa, in exchange for land at Boat Quay.

=== 1859–1876 ===
The new gardens started off functioning primarily as a “pleasure park” for the society&#x27;s members. Lawrence Niven was hired as superintendent and landscape designer to turn what were essentially overgrown plantations and a tangle of virgin rainforest into a public park. He and his team worked on developing the Gardens to reflect the styles of the English Landscape Garden Movement. This included a series of “interconnecting pathways and promenades, a levelled parade area for military bands to play music... and the establishment of ornamental planting”. The layout of the Gardens as it is today is largely based on Niven&#x27;s design. In 1866 the Gardens expanded in the Northwest direction by about 12 hectares. The excavation of Swan Lake took place in 1866. In 1868, the Burkill Hall was completed. The Singapore Agri-horticultural Society ran out of funds, which led to the colonial government taking over the management of the gardens in 1874. In 1875, the Raffles Library Committee selected a horticulturist, Henry James Murton, to serve as the first Superintendent of Gardens, while a zoology expert, William Krohn, was hired as the superintendent of the Zoological Garden to build up a collection of animals within the gardens, establishing the first zoo in Singapore. By 1877, the developed parts of the gardens were dotted with enclosures housing a collection of about 150 animals.

=== 1877–1942 ===
The first rubber seedlings came to the gardens from Kew Gardens in 1877. A naturalist, Henry Nicholas Ridley, or Mad Ridley as he was known, became the director of the gardens in 1888 and spearheaded rubber cultivation. Successful in his experiments with rubber planting, Ridley convinced planters across Malaya to adopt his methods. The results were astounding; Malaya became the world&#x27;s number one producer and exporter of natural rubber.

In 1879, the Palm Valley was established on the site of the former Economic Garden. Nathaniel Cantley, who replaced Murton as the second Superintendent of Gardens in 1880, oversaw the building installation of Ridley Hall in 1882. Other installations included the Plant House, an arboretum in the former Economic Garden, and plant nurseries. Due to the high upkeep of the zoo at the gardens, in 1903, the colonial government decided to sell all the animals and birds and shut it down. More building installations at the garden included E.J.H Corner House in 1910 and Holttum Hall in 1921. This was also the period when Singapore&#x27;s national flower, the orchid Hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim, was founded, which was part of the achievement of the pioneering of orchid hybridisation by Professor Eric Holttum, director of the Gardens from 1925 to 1949. His techniques led to Singapore being one of the world&#x27;s top centres of commercial orchid growing. Presently, it has the largest collection of tropical plant specimens.

=== 1942–1945 ===
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore from 1942 to 1945, Hidezo Tanakadate (田中館秀三), a professor of geology from Tohoku Imperial University, learned of the possibility that the Gardens and Museum might be looted due to the occupation, and negotiated directly with general Tomoyuki Yamashita to gain control of the Singapore Botanic Gardens and the Raffles Museum. At the beginning of the occupation, he ensured that no looting occurred in the Gardens and the Museum. Both institutions continued to function as scientific institutions. Holttum and Edred John Henry Corner were interned in the Gardens and instructed to continue their horticultural work. The Japanese government and army were unwilling to fund the institutions, however, and Tanakadate had to pay for maintenance and staff salaries from his own pocket. The Gardens was also renamed as Shōnan Botanic Gardens (). Tanaka returned to Japan in July 1943, and Dr. , a retired professor of botany from the Kyoto Imperial University and secretary-general of the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Malayan military administration department&#x27;s general affairs department, was appointed director to the Gardens and Museum, posts he held until the end of the war.

=== 1945–1986 ===
After the war ended, the Gardens was handed back to the control of the British in September 1945, and Koriba was made a prisoner of war. Corner negotiated for Koriba&#x27;s release with the British command, citing his contributions to protecting the Gardens, but he chose to remain in custody alongside his countrymen until his release in January 1946.

Murray Ross Henderson, curator of the Herbarium before the war, succeeded Holttum as director from 1949 to 1954. Eventually the Gardens played an important role during the &quot;greening Singapore&quot; campaign and Garden City campaign during the early independence years.

=== 1986–present===
The Singapore Botanic Gardens was put under the charge of the National Parks Board. The Gardens was revitalised with new and improved public amenities, research facilities and training facilities (1990–2005). Here, the focus is on Garden City Vision, Horticulture, Taxonomic + Biodiversity Research, Recreation and Education.

A &quot;Tyersall extension&quot; to the Gardens was announced in 2009. A total of 18 hectares of land was added in expanding the Gardens by almost four times its original size in 1859. Known as the Gardens&#x27; Learning Forest when it was fully completed in 2018, the extensions included a Forest Conservation Interpretive Centre and a Natural History Art Gallery, housed in colonial buildings more than a century old. The Learning Forest showcases the best of tropical trees that grow under local conditions and strengthen the Botanic Gardens&#x27; position as a premier institute for research, conservation and education. Visitors are able to appreciate this unique collection of trees and plants through various thematic walks within the Learning Forest featuring giant trees, trees with interesting forms and barks of various textures, a conservation collection of rare fruit and nut species and a bamboo garden. Also included is a flood protection scheme for the main shopping district of Orchard Road and its surroundings and a water detention pond with capacity to hold excess storm-water of about 15 Olympic-size pools.

==Attractions==
The garden is bordered by Holland Road and Napier Road to the south, Cluny Road to the east, Tyersall Avenue and Cluny Park Road to the west and Bukit Timah Road to the north. The linear distance between the northern and southern ends is around . There are a number of entrances at different zones of the gardens, though the Tanglin Gate facing Holland Road in the south is the grand entrance.

===National Orchid Garden===
The National Orchid Garden is the main attraction within the Botanic Gardens. Located on the mid-western side of the Garden, the hilly three-hectare site has a collection of more than 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids of orchids.

There are a number of attractions within the Orchid Garden, including the following -

Burkill Hall: Burkill Hall is a colonial plantation bungalow built in 1886. It used to be the director&#x27;s house and was named in honour of the only father and son pair to hold the post of Director of Singapore Botanic Gardens, Isaac and Humphrey Burkill. The ground level serves as an exhibition area, showcasing information on the different hybrids named after VIPs who have visited the garden.

VIP Orchid Garden: located at the back of Burkill Hall, it displays hybrids of the most popular VIP orchids. Notable ones include &quot;Dendrobium Memoria&quot; Princess Diana, &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Margaret Thatcher, × &quot;Renantanda&quot; Akihito, &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Masako Kotaishi Hidenka, &quot;Dendrobium&quot; Elizabeth and &quot;Vanda&quot; Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. More than 100 celebrities, dignitaries, and visiting heads of states have been honoured by Singapore&#x27;s &quot;orchid diplomacy&quot; program.

Orchidarium: A haven for serious orchids enthusiasts, the Orchidarium houses natural species in a tropical setting.

Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse: Tan Hoon Siang was a descendant of Tan Tock Seng, who was a philanthropist and founder of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The misthouse contains a colourful collection of different hybrids. It also has a small collection of fragrant orchids like &quot;Vanda&quot; Mimi Palmer.

Lady Yuen-Peng McNeice Bromeliad House: Named in honour of its sponsor, the Bromeliad House showcases plants from the family Bromeliaceae, which includes the pineapple. The unique collection of bromeliads on display was acquired from Shelldance Nursery in the United States in 1994.

Coolhouse: The Coolhouse tries to recreate the environment of a tropical highland forest and showcases orchids that are normally only found in the tropical highland areas.

===Rainforest===
The Singapore Botanic Gardens has a small tropical rainforest of around six hectares in size, which is older than the gardens itself. The rainforest and its bigger cousin at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve are located within the Singapore&#x27;s city limits. Singapore is one of the only two major cities with a tropical rainforest within its city limits, the other being Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro.

===Ginger Garden===
Located next to the National Orchid Garden, this one-hectare garden brings together members of the family Zingiberaceae. The garden houses a restaurant called the Halia Restaurant. There is also a drop-off point along Tyersall Avenue as well as a waterfall. The garden was officially opened in 2003 and it took over the spot vacated by the previous Orchid Enclosure.

===Botany Centre and Tanglin Gate===

The two new blocks of offices and classroom in the upgraded Tanglin Core area are known as the Botany Centre. They house the:
* Library of Botany and Horticulture (including the Public Reference Centre);
* the Singapore Herbarium (International acronym: Herb. SING), housing 750,000 specimens;
* Orchid Breeding and Micropropagation; and
* education outreach and workshop classrooms.

The corridors and walkways of the Botany Centre are covered by leaf imprints. There are also a number of wooden carvings scattered around the grounds and fern-covered vertical walls.

The Green Pavilion is the first &quot;green roof&quot; in Singapore. Weed and grass-like plants fully cover the pitched roof. It houses the visitor services desk as well as a café called Food For Thought in the basement.

The offices of former directors, namely Holttum Hall (after Eric Holttum, Director of the Gardens from 1925 to 1949) and Ridley Hall (after Henry Nicholas Ridley, first director of Gardens from 1888 to 1911) were preserved and now known as the Singapore Botanic Gardens&#x27; Heritage Museum and Ridley Hall (a function space).

===Jacob Ballas Children&#x27;s Garden===
The Children&#x27;s Garden was named after its main donor Jacob Ballas, a Jewish-Singaporean philanthropist who died in 2004.

Built at a cost of S$7 million (of which $99 million was donated by the Jacob Ballas Trust and sponsors), it is located at the quieter northern end of the Botanic Gardens. It has its own visitor centre with a café. It opened on Children&#x27;s Day, 1 October 2007. The National Parks Board claims it is Asia&#x27;s first children&#x27;s garden. There are play areas like the Water Play area, a small playground, tree-houses with slides, and a maze. There are also interactive exhibits that teach how photosynthesis takes place, and a mini-garden that showcases how plants may be used to make dyes, beverages or as herbs.

At the Children&#x27;s Garden Visitor Centre there is a sculpture by the Israeli artist Zodok Ben-David. Named &quot;Mystree&quot;, it was commissioned by the Yad Vashem museum in 2010. From a distance, the sculpture looks like a tree but a closer inspection reveals 500 human figures.

Although it is considered part of the Botanic Gardens, the Children&#x27;s Garden has its own entrance along Bukit Timah Road existing as a separate enclosure.

===Other attractions===
Tropical plants line the bank of the Saraca Stream as it meanders its way down a small hill. The main highlights of the stream walk are the Yellow Saraca trees (&quot;Saraca cauliflora&quot;) and Red Saraca (&quot;Saraca declinata&quot;). Other attractions include the Palm Valley, Bandstand area, Sun Garden and Sundial Garden.


The Botanic Gardens has three lakes, namely Symphony Lake, Eco-Lake and Swan Lake. The Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage on Symphony Lake occasionally has free concerts on weekends. Notable performers include the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and Singapore Chinese Orchestra. On 10 October 2008, a statue of the composer Frédéric Chopin was unveiled just south of Symphony Lake.

The headquarters of the National Parks Board is located within the grounds of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Eateries within the garden include the one-Michelin-starred Corner House, a casual fine-dining restaurant in a colonial bungalow; Casa Verde, a café at the Visitor Centre; and Halia Restaurant, a restaurant at the Ginger Garden. There are also gift shops for visitors. Singapore&#x27;s national agency in biodiversity-related issues, the National Biodiversity Centre, is also located within the grounds of the gardens.

==UNESCO==
An official application for Singapore Botanic Gardens to be listed as a World Heritage Site was submitted to UNESCO in January 2014. The bid underlines the gardens&#x27; historical and cultural significance and its achievements in conservation and research. A 700-page nomination dossier was compiled and written up over one-and-a-half years, led by the National Heritage Board&#x27;s (NHB) preservation of sites and monuments division and the Botanic Gardens director, Dr Nigel Taylor, who was also involved in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew&#x27;s own UNESCO bid from 2000 to 2003.

As part of the process, the dossier had to seek the assessment of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), a separate professional association. On 16 May 2015, ICOMOS&#x27;s panel of experts backed the inscription without reservation – the best recommendation possible, stating:

On 4 July that year, in Bonn, the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee deliberated Singapore&#x27;s submission, and all 21 members endorsed it.
Dr Taylor recalled the unanimous vote:
:

Singapore Botanic Gardens is the first tropical, and only the third botanic gardens on the UNESCO World Heritage listing. The honour was widely noted as a fitting tribute to the nation&#x27;s 50th year of independence.

<text>A substation is a part of an electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system. Substations transform voltage from high to low, or the reverse, or perform any of several other important functions. Between the generating station and the consumer, electric power may flow through several substations at different voltage levels. A substation may include transformers to change voltage levels between high transmission voltages and lower distribution voltages, or at the interconnection of two different transmission voltages. They are a common component of the infrastructure. There are 55,000 substations in the United States.

Substations may be owned and operated by an electrical utility, or may be owned by a large industrial or commercial customer. Generally substations are unattended, relying on SCADA for remote supervision and control.

The word &quot;substation&quot; comes from the days before the distribution system became a grid. As central generation stations became larger, smaller generating plants were converted to distribution stations, receiving their energy supply from a larger plant instead of using their own generators. The first substations were connected to only one power station, where the generators were housed, and were subsidiaries of that power station.
==Construction==
Substations may be designed and built by a contractor or alternately all phases of its development may be handled by the electrical utility. Most commonly, the utility does the engineering and procurement while hiring a contractor for actual construction. Major design constraints for construction of substations include land availability and cost, limitations on the construction period, transportation restrictions, and the need to get the substation running quickly. Prefabrication is a common way to reduce the construction cost. For connecting the new substation, a partial outage at another substation may be required, but the utility often tries to minimize downtime.

==Types==

Substations typically serve at least one of the following purposes:
*Increasing the voltage produced by electric power generation for efficient transmission over long distances, using step-up transformers
*Interconnection of different power grids
*Reducing the voltage from transmission to lower-voltage distribution lines that supply individual homes or businesses
*Converting from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC)

===Transmission substation===
A &quot;transmission substation&quot; connects two or more transmission lines. The simplest case is where all transmission lines have the same voltage. In such cases, substation contains high-voltage switches that allow lines to be connected or isolated for fault clearance or maintenance. A transmission station may have transformers to convert between two transmission voltages, voltage control/power factor correction devices such as capacitors, reactors or static VAR compensators and equipment such as phase shifting transformers to control power flow between two adjacent power systems.

Transmission substations can range from simple to complex. A small &quot;switching station&quot; may be little more than a bus plus some circuit breakers. The largest transmission substations can cover a large area (several acres/hectares) with multiple voltage levels, many circuit breakers, and a large amount of protection and control equipment (voltage and current transformers, relays and SCADA systems). Modern substations may be implemented using international standards such as IEC Standard 61850.

===Distribution substation===
A &quot;distribution substation&quot; transfers power from the transmission system to the distribution system of an area. It is uneconomical to directly connect electricity consumers to the main transmission network, unless they use large amounts of power, so the distribution station reduces voltage to a level suitable for local distribution.

The input for a distribution substation is typically at least two transmission or sub-transmission lines. Input voltage may be, for example, 115 kV, or whatever is common in the area. The output is a number of feeders. Distribution voltages are typically medium voltage, between 2.4 kV and 33 kV, depending on the size of the area served and the practices of the local utility. The feeders run along streets overhead (or underground, in some cases) and power the distribution transformers at or near the customer premises.

In addition to transforming voltage, distribution substations also isolate faults in either the transmission or distribution systems. Distribution substations are typically the points of voltage regulation, although on long distribution circuits (of several miles/kilometers), voltage regulation equipment may also be installed along the line.

The downtown areas of large cities feature complicated distribution substations, with high-voltage switching, and switching and backup systems on the low-voltage side. More typical distribution substations have a switch, one transformer, and minimal facilities on the low-voltage side.

===Collector substation===
In distributed generation projects such as a wind farm or photovoltaic power station, a collector substation may be required. It resembles a distribution substation although power flow is in the opposite direction, from many wind turbines or inverters up into the transmission grid. Usually for economy of construction the collector system operates around 35 kV, although some collector systems are 12 kV, and the collector substation steps up voltage to a transmission voltage for the grid. The collector substation can also provide power factor correction if it is needed, metering, and control of the wind farm. In some special cases a collector substation can also contain an HVDC converter station.

Collector substations also exist where multiple thermal or hydroelectric power plants of comparable output power are in proximity. Examples for such substations are Brauweiler in Germany and Hradec in the Czech Republic, where power is collected from nearby lignite-fired power plants. If no transformers are required for increasing the voltage to transmission level, the substation is a switching station.

===Converter substations===
Converter substations may be associated with HVDC converter plants, traction current, or interconnected non-synchronous networks. These stations contain power electronic devices to change the frequency of current, or else convert from alternating to direct current or the reverse. Formerly rotary converters changed frequency to interconnect two systems; nowadays such substations are rare.

===Switching station===

A switching station is a substation without transformers and operating only at a single voltage level. Switching stations are sometimes used as collector and distribution stations. Sometimes they are used for switching the current to back-up lines or for parallelizing circuits in case of failure. An example is the switching stations for the HVDC Inga–Shaba transmission line.

A switching station may also be known as a switchyard, and these are commonly located directly adjacent to or nearby a power station. In this case the generators from the power station supply their power into the yard onto the generator bus on one side of the yard, and the transmission lines take their power from a Feeder Bus on the other side of the yard.

An important function performed by a substation is switching, which is the connecting and disconnecting of transmission lines or other components to and from the system. Switching events may be planned or unplanned. A transmission line or other component may need to be de-energized for maintenance or for new construction, for example, adding or removing a transmission line or a transformer. To maintain reliability of supply, companies aim at keeping the system up and running while performing maintenance. All work to be performed, from routine testing to adding entirely new substations, should be done while keeping the whole system running.

Unplanned switching events are caused by a fault in a transmission line or any other component, for example:
*a line is hit by lightning and develops an arc,
*a tower is blown down by high wind.
The function of the switching station is to isolate the faulty portion of the system in the shortest possible time. De-energizing faulty equipment protects it from further damage, and isolating a fault helps keep the rest of the electrical grid operating with stability.

===Railways===

Electrified railways also use substations, often distribution substations. In some cases a conversion of the current type takes place, commonly with rectifiers for direct current (DC) trains, or rotary converters for trains using alternating current (AC) at frequencies other than that of the public grid. Sometimes they are also transmission substations or collector substations if the railway network also operates its own grid and generators to supply the other stations.

===Mobile substation===
A &quot;mobile substation&quot; is a substation on wheels, containing a transformer, breakers and buswork mounted on a self-contained semi-trailer, meant to be pulled by a truck. They are designed to be compact for travel on public roads, and are used for temporary backup in times of natural disaster or war. Mobile substations are usually rated much lower than permanent installations, and may be built in several units to meet road travel limitations.

==Design==


Substation design is aimed at minimizing cost while ensuring power availability and reliability, and enabling changes to the substation in the future.

Substations may be built outdoors, indoors, or underground or in a combination of these locations.

===Location selection===
Selection of the location of a substation must consider many factors. Sufficient land area is required for installation of equipment with necessary clearances for electrical safety, and for access to maintain large apparatus such as transformers. The site must have room for expansion due to load growth or planned transmission additions. Environmental effects of the substation must be considered, such as drainage, noise and road traffic effects.

The substation site must be reasonably central to the distribution area to be served. The site must be secure from intrusion by passers-by, both to protect people from injury by electric shock or arcs, and to protect the electrical system from misoperation due to vandalism.

If not owned and operated by a utility company, substations are typically occupied on a long lease such as a renewable 99-year lease, giving the utility company security of tenure.

===Design diagrams===

The first step in planning a substation layout is the preparation of a one-line diagram, which shows in simplified form the switching and protection arrangement required, as well as the incoming supply lines and outgoing feeders or transmission lines. It is a usual practice by many electrical utilities to prepare one-line diagrams with principal elements (lines, switches, circuit breakers, transformers) arranged on the page similarly to the way the apparatus would be laid out in the actual station.

In a common design, incoming lines have a disconnector and a circuit breaker. In some cases, the lines will not have both, with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary. A disconnect switch is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker is used as a protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the &#x27;wrong&#x27; direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the feeding point. This seeks to isolate the fault point from the rest of the system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact. Both switches and circuit breakers may be operated locally (within the substation) or remotely from a supervisory control center.

With overhead transmission lines, the propagation of lightning and switching surges can cause insulation failures into substation equipment. Line entrance surge arrestors are used to protect substation equipment accordingly. Insulation Coordination studies are carried out extensively to ensure equipment failure (and associated outages) is minimal.

Once past the switching components, the lines of a given voltage connect to one or more buses. These are sets of busbars, usually in multiples of three, since three-phase electrical power distribution is largely universal around the world.

The arrangement of switches, circuit breakers, and buses used affects the cost and reliability of the substation. For important substations a ring bus, double bus, or so-called &quot;breaker and a half&quot; setup can be used, so that the failure of any one circuit breaker does not interrupt power to other circuits, and so that parts of the substation may be de-energized for maintenance and repairs. Substations feeding only a single industrial load may have minimal switching provisions, especially for small installations. 

===Safety===
Because of the risk of electrical shock, substations are inherently dangerous to electrical workers. To mitigate this hazard, substations are designed with various safety features. Live conductors and bare equipment are kept separate, either with protected equipment, or using screens or distance. Based on the jurisdiction or company, there are safety standards with minimum required clearance between different live equipment or conductors or between live metal and the ground, which often varies with higher clearance being required for higher voltages because of the greater ability to generate flashover. To this is added the necessary space for employees to work safely and vehicles to pass. Sometimes it is necessary to work on parts of the substation while energized, but employees must maintain a safe distance of at least . The aim to reduce substation footprints comes into conflict with ease of maintenance enhanced by including gaps where employees can safely work.

Underneath a substation, a mat or grid of conductors laid around underground provides grounding. This grid, which is typically copper although it may be galvanized iron in some countries, is used to ground circuits that are being worked on to prevent accidental re-energization while workers are in contact with a de-energized circuit. Often, earth rods are driven deeper into the ground from the grounding grid for lower resistance grounding, and may be surrounded by bentonite or marconite to further reduce resistance and ensure effective grounding for the lifetime of the substation. Above ground, the grounding conductors may be steel, aluminum, or copper. They must be thick enough to carry the expected current of a fault for 1-3 seconds and remain undamaged. Substation fences, typically at least in height, both protect the public from electrical hazards and also protect the substation from vandalism. Internal fences can also be incorporated to protect employees from areas that are unsafe when energized.

== Components ==

Substations generally have switching, protection and control equipment, and transformers. In a large substation, circuit breakers are used to interrupt any short circuits or overload currents that may occur on the network. Smaller distribution stations may use recloser circuit breakers or fuses for protection of distribution circuits. Substations themselves do not usually have generators, although a power plant may have a substation nearby. Other devices such as capacitors, voltage regulators, and reactors may also be located at a substation.

Substations may be on the surface in fenced enclosures, underground, or special-purpose buildings. High-rise buildings may have several indoor substations. Indoor substations are usually found in urban areas to reduce the noise from transformers, improve appearance, or protect switchgear from extreme climate or pollution.

Substations often use busbars as conductors between electrical equipment. Busbars may be aluminum tubing thick, or else wires (strain bus).

Outdoor, above-ground substation structures include wood pole, lattice metal tower, and tubular metal structures, although other variants are available. Where space is plentiful and appearance of the station is not a factor, steel lattice towers provide low-cost supports for transmission lines and apparatus. Low-profile substations may be specified in suburban areas where appearance is more critical. Indoor substations may be gas insulated substations (GIS) (at high voltages, with gas insulated switchgear), or use metal-enclosed or metal-clad switchgear at lower voltages. Urban and suburban indoor substations may be finished on the outside so as to blend in with other buildings in the area.

A &quot;compact substation&quot; is generally an outdoor substation built in a metal enclosure, in which each item of the electrical equipment is located very near to each other to create a relatively smaller footprint size of the substation.

=== Switchgear ===
High-voltage circuit breakers are commonly used to interrupt the flow of current in substation equipment. At the time of interruption, current could be normal, too high due to excessive load, unusual due to a fault, or tripped by protective relays prior to anticipated trouble. The most common technologies to extinguish the power arc from separating the conductors in the breaker include:
*Air at atmospheric pressure (air-insulated switchgear (AIS)), which is the most common worldwide. Air is the cheapest insulator and is easy to modify, but AIS takes up more space, and leaves equipment exposed to the outside environment. One drawback of AIS is the visual impact of a larger substation with overhead power lines entering and exiting, which may be unacceptable in scenic or urban areas. AIS requires additional bracing in a seismically active area, and emits more electromagnetic fields and noise than alternative technologies.
*Gas (gas circuit breaker (GCB) or gas-insulated switchgear (GIS)), most commonly sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or a mixture of gases including SF6. Although it is the most expensive, these gases are a much more effective insulator than air. GIS require only 10 to 20 percent of the land area as AIS, which can save on land acquisition cost in urban areas, and allow the substation to be built at the exact location where its power is being used in an industrial or urban area—which can be a significant cost savings. On the generation side, GIS can be installed closer to the generator which allows cost savings in cabling, bus duct connections, and civil construction and can increase reliability. GIS can replace AIS if power requirements increase without requiring additional land area. Additionally, GIS is commonly installed in an enclosed building that keeps the equipment protected from pollution and salt. Unless the substation is often used for switching, maintenance cost can be very low or even zero for many years. Because SF6 turns to solid around , in some climates these circuit breakers require heaters to function in extremely cold weather. SF6 has been used in switchgear since the 1960s.
*Mineral oil (called OCB for oil circuit breaker) provides a high resistance between the opened contacts, effectively stopping the flow of current. Although oil circuit breakers are suitable for a wide range of voltages, the oil becomes contaminated during the suppression of arcs and must be filtered or replaced periodically.
*Vacuum is a better insulator than air but less than gas or oil. Vacuum circuit breakers (VCB) are smaller than air circuit breakers and are commonly used in distribution and other switchgear under 35kv.
*Mixed, including both gas and air insulation. Although it’s the least common option it can be useful when an air-insulated substation needs to be expanded but there is very limited location for additional construction.

Reclosers are similar to breakers, and can be cheaper because they do not require separate protective relays. Often used in distribution, they often are programmed to trip when the amps exceed a certain amount over a period of time. Reclosers will attempt to re-energize the circuit after a delay. If unsuccessful for a few times, the recloser will have to be manually reset by an electrical worker.

=== Capacitors ===

Capacitor banks are used in substations to balance the lagging current draw from inductive loads (such as motors, transformers, and some industrial equipment) with their reactive load. Additional capacitor capacity may be needed if dispersed generation (such as small diesel generators, rooftop photovoltaic solar panels, or wind turbines) are added to the system. Capacitors can reduce the current in wires, helping stem system losses from voltage drop or enabling extra power to be sent through the conductors. Capacitors may be left on in response to constant inductive load or turned on when inductive load is increased, such as in the summer for air conditioners. The switching may be remote and can be done manually or automatically.
===Control rooms===
Larger substations have control rooms for the equipment used to monitor, control, and protect the rest of the substation equipment. It often contains protective relays, meters, breaker controls, communications, batteries, and recorders that save detailed data about substation operations, particularly when there is any unusual activity, to help reconstruct what happened after the fact. These control rooms typically are heated and air conditioned to ensure the reliable operation of this equipment. Additional equipment is necessary to handle power surges associated with intermittent renewable energy such as dispersed generation from wind or solar.

===Transformers===
Most transformers lose between 5 and 1.5 percent of their input as heat and noise. Iron losses are no-load and constant whenever the transformer is energized, while copper and auxiliary losses are proportionate to the square of the current. Auxiliary losses are due to running fans and pumps which is noisy when the transformer is operating at maximum capacity. To reduce noise, enclosures are often built around the transformer and can also be added after the substation is built.

Oil-based transformers are often built with bunded areas to prevent the escape of flaming or leaking oil. Fire separation areas or firewalls are built around the transformer to stop the spread of fire. Firefighting vehicles are allowed a path to access the area.
==Maintenance==
Maintenance of substations involves inspections, data collection and analysis, and routine scheduled work. Using methods such as infrared scanning and dissolved gas analysis, it can be predicted when the substation will need maintenance and predict dangers before they materialize. Infrared technology finds hot spots in the substation where electrical energy is being converted to heat, which indicates a problem and can cause additional damage from the high heat. Dissolved gas analysis can tell when an oil-insulated transformer needs to have the oil filtered or replace, and also detect other issues.

==Automation==

Early electrical substations required manual switching or adjustment of equipment, and manual collection of data for load, energy consumption, and abnormal events. As the complexity of distribution networks grew, it became economically necessary to automate supervision and control of substations from a centrally attended point, to allow overall coordination in case of emergencies and to reduce operating costs. Early efforts to remote control substations used dedicated communication wires, often run alongside power circuits. Power-line carrier, microwave radio, fiber optic cables as well as dedicated wired remote control circuits have all been applied to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) for substations. The development of the microprocessor made for an exponential increase in the number of points that could be economically controlled and monitored. Today, standardized communication protocols such as DNP3, IEC 61850 and Modbus, to list a few, are used to allow multiple intelligent electronic devices to communicate with each other and supervisory control centers. Distributed automatic control at substations is one element of the so-called smart grid.

<doc id="320223" wikidata="Q561196" url="?curid=320223" title="Héctor Germán Oesterheld">
<text>Héctor Germán Oesterheld ( ; ; born 23 July 1919; disappeared and presumed dead 1977), also known by the common abbreviation HGO, was an Argentine journalist, comics editor and writer of graphic novels and comics. He is widely celebrated as a master in his field and as one of the pioneering artists in modern Argentine comics.

Through his comics, Oesterheld criticized the numerous military dictatorships that beleaguered the country in different periods ranging from 1955 to 1983, as well as different facets of capitalism, colonialism and imperialism, choosing a subtle criticism in his early comics during the 1950s and early 1960s, and a stronger and direct approach in his later work, after the execution of Che Guevara in 1967, and onwards from then on: in 1968 he wrote a biographical comic book of Che Guevara, which was subsequently banned and destroyed—later republished (and for the first time in complete form) in 2008—by the ruling military dictatorship self-styled as &quot;Argentine Revolution&quot; (1966–1973).

Shortly before the start of Argentina&#x27;s last military dictatorship (1976–1983), Oesterheld and his daughters had joined the Montoneros, a leftist (and former peronist) guerrilla group that immediately opposed the military junta. HGO continued to publish works in clandestine form while hidden in secret locations, but he was ultimately kidnapped and disappeared in 1977. His daughters were also arrested and disappeared, as were his sons-in-law. Only HGO&#x27;s wife, Elsa Sánchez de Oesterheld, escaped the family&#x27;s fate.

==Biography==
Oesterheld was born on 23 July 1919 in Buenos Aires to a German father and a Spanish Basque mother. His early studies were in geology, which has been said to contribute to his acuity as a science fiction writer. He began his journalistic career in the early 1940s. His first work appeared in the daily &quot;La Prensa&quot; newspaper and then was published by Codex. He moved to Abril publishers, where he began his extensive career as a comics writer.

Soon after, he married Elsa Sánchez. Their first daughter, Estela, was born in 1952, Diana a year later, Beatriz in 1955, and Marina in 1957.

Oesterheld was befriended by a group of postwar Italian comics writers, including Mario Faustinelli, Hugo Pratt, Ivo Pavone, and Dino Battaglia, also known as the &quot;Venice Group&quot;. Together these artists and writers became part of what is known as the &quot;Golden Age of Argentine Comics.&quot; They merged into an international scene of artists and writers whose works were published worldwide.

In 1957 Oesterheld and his brother Jorge founded Editorial Frontera. Together they published various comic magazines, including &quot;Hora Cero Semanal&quot; (weekly), &quot;Hora Cero Mensual&quot; (monthly), and &quot;Frontera Mensual&quot; (monthly).

In 1958 he started writing &quot;El Eternauta&quot;, probably his most popular and critically acclaimed work. The strip, with artwork by Francisco Solano López, told the story of his meeting with a time traveler, who had already lived over 100 lives and has journeyed to the past to warn the protagonist of a future catastrophe. The strip was published in &quot;Hora Cero&quot; over 106 weekly episodes and was a massive success.

His publishing house closed five years later due to a combination of the economic crisis sweeping Argentina in the 1960s, foreign competition, and the exodus of Argentine comic artists to Europe. Oesterheld continued writing for other magazines such as &quot;Zig-Zag&quot;.

His work slowly acquired a greater political emphasis. His 1968 biography of Ernesto &#x27;Che&#x27; Guevara, a year after Che&#x27;s death, was removed from circulation by the government and the originals destroyed. In 1970 he wrote a scathing critical biography of Evita Peron, dedicated to Che Guevara. In 1973 he published &quot;450 Years of War Against Imperialism&quot;. During the military government of the 1970s, Oesterheld is believed to have joined, following his four daughters, a leftist guerrilla group, the Montoneros. His story &quot;El Eternauta, Part II&quot; (1976) described a futuristic Argentina under a dictatorship.

In 1977 Oesterheld disappeared. He was last recorded as seen alive in late 1977 or early 1978, the year when he was presumably murdered by the dictatorship. His family believed he was among the tens of thousands to have disappeared and been killed by the government. In 1977 his daughters, Diana (23), Beatriz (19), Estela (25) and Marina (18), were arrested by the Argentine armed forces in La Plata. None were seen again, and they were all presumed dead. His daughters&#x27; husbands also disappeared.

One grandson, Martín, was born in captivity. Oesterheld&#x27;s widow, Elsa Sánchez, learned about the boy and recovered him from government custody, although she never saw her daughter again. She raised Martin. A second grandson, Fernando, born earlier, was raised by his paternal grandparents.

Elsa Sánchez participated in the protests of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. She became one of the spokeswomen for the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, which advocates for the return of children of the &quot;disappeared&quot; to their birth families.

When the Italian journalist Alberto Ongaro enquired about Oesterheld&#x27;s disappearance in 1979, he received the reply: &quot;We did away with him because he wrote the most beautiful story of Ché Guevara ever done&quot;. Argentine journalist Jacobo Timmerman, in his memoir of his own captivity, &quot;Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number&quot; (1981), recalls seeing Oesterheld in 1977 across the hall in a prison. In a report to the Argentine National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons, which published its findings in 1984 entitled &quot;Nunca Más&quot;, Eduardo Arias recalls seeing Oesterheld between November 1977 and January 1978. He said the man was in terrible physical condition and at the secret detention center , which prisoners had sardonically named &quot;&quot;.

==Legacy==

Oesterheld worked with artists including Hugo Pratt, Alberto Breccia, Francisco Solano López, Ivo Pavone, Dino Battaglia, as well as Horacio Altuna, José Massaroli, Eugenio Zoppi, Paul Campani, Gustavo Trigo, Julio Schiaffino and others.

<text>Ribadavia is a town and municipality located in the southwest of the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the comarca of O Ribeiro. The urban area lies on the right bank of the Miño river and the last course of the Avia river. It is the capital of the comarca of the Ribeiro. Near N-120 road and A-52 Rias Baixas highway, it is from the provincial capital and from Vigo.

The town was declared a &quot;Historic-Artistic ensemble&quot; in 1947. Near the Campo da Feira, one can find the ruins of the castle of the Sarmientos, the Counts of Ribadavia, dating from the fifteenth century. It still preserves the interior, towers and the walls. Parts of the walls that surrounded the town are also still standing. Inside the old quarter (casco vello/Barrio Xudeu), one can visit the main square (Praza Maior) with interesting buildings like the sixteenth-century town hall. There are also buildings remaining from what was once a large Jewish quarter, including a synagogue.
All the economic life of the comarca of the Ribeiro has centered on, since the twelfth century, the vines first brought by the monks of Cluny who accompanied the first count of Galicia, Raymond of Burgundy. Today, the wine is commercialised under the protected designation of origin Ribeiro.

<doc id="320233" wikidata="Q1523756" url="?curid=320233" title="Instrumentation amplifier">
<text>An instrumentation amplifier (sometimes shorthanded as in-amp or InAmp) is a type of differential amplifier that has been outfitted with input buffer amplifiers, which eliminate the need for input impedance matching and thus make the amplifier particularly suitable for use in measurement and test equipment. Additional characteristics include very low DC offset, low drift, low noise, very high open-loop gain, very high common-mode rejection ratio, and very high input impedances. Instrumentation amplifiers are used where great accuracy and stability of the circuit both short- and long-term are required.

Although the instrumentation amplifier is usually shown schematically identical to a standard operational amplifier (op-amp), the electronic instrumentation amplifier is almost always internally composed of 3 op-amps. These are arranged so that there is one op-amp to buffer each input (+, −), and one to produce the desired output with adequate impedance matching for the function.

The most commonly used instrumentation amplifier circuit is shown in the figure. The gain of the circuit is

: formula_1

The rightmost amplifier, along with the resistors labelled formula_2 and formula_3 is just the standard differential-amplifier circuit, with gain formula_4 and differential input resistance formula_5. The two amplifiers on the left are the buffers. With formula_6 removed (open-circuited), they are simple unity-gain buffers; the circuit will work in that state, with gain simply equal to formula_4 and high input impedance because of the buffers. The buffer gain could be increased by putting resistors between the buffer inverting inputs and ground to shunt away some of the negative feedback; however, the single resistor formula_6 between the two inverting inputs is a much more elegant method: it increases the differential-mode gain of the buffer pair while leaving the common-mode gain equal to 1. This increases the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of the circuit and also enables the buffers to handle much larger common-mode signals without clipping than would be the case if they were separate and had the same gain.
Another benefit of the method is that it boosts the gain using a single resistor rather than a pair, thus avoiding a resistor-matching problem and very conveniently allowing the gain of the circuit to be changed by changing the value of a single resistor. A set of switch-selectable resistors or even a potentiometer can be used for formula_6, providing easy changes to the gain of the circuit, without the complexity of having to switch matched pairs of resistors.

The ideal common-mode gain of an instrumentation amplifier is zero. In the circuit shown, common-mode gain is caused by mismatch in the resistor ratios formula_10 and by the mismatch in common-mode gains of the two input op-amps. Obtaining very closely matched resistors is a significant difficulty in fabricating these circuits, as is optimizing the common-mode performance.

An instrumentation amplifier can also be built with two op-amps to save on cost, but the gain must be higher than two (+6 dB).

Instrumentation amplifiers can be built with individual op-amps and precision resistors, but are also available in integrated circuit from several manufacturers (including Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, and Renesas Electronics). An IC instrumentation amplifier typically contains closely matched laser-trimmed resistors, and therefore offers excellent common-mode rejection. Examples include INA128, AD8221, LT1167 and MAX4194.

Instrumentation amplifiers can also be designed using &quot;indirect current-feedback architecture&quot;, which extend the operating range of these amplifiers to the negative power supply rail, and in some cases the positive power supply rail. This can be particularly useful in single-supply systems, where the negative power rail is simply the circuit ground (GND). Examples of parts utilizing this architecture are MAX4208/MAX4209 and AD8129/AD8130 .

==Types==
===Feedback-free instrumentation amplifier===
Feedback-free instrumentation amplifier is the high-input-impedance differential amplifier designed without the external feedback network. This allows reduction in the number of amplifiers (one instead of three), reduced noise (no thermal noise is brought on by the feedback resistors) and increased bandwidth (no frequency compensation is needed). 
Chopper-stabilized (or zero-drift) instrumentation amplifiers such as the LTC2053 use a switching-input frontend to eliminate DC offset errors and drift.

<text>Helen Battles Sawyer Hogg (August 1, 1905 – January 28, 1993) was an American-Canadian astronomer who pioneered research into globular clusters and variable stars. She was the first female president of several astronomical organizations and a scientist when many universities would not award scientific degrees to women. Her scientific advocacy and journalism included astronomy columns in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; (&quot;With the Stars&quot;, 1951–81) and the &quot;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&quot; (&quot;Out of Old Books&quot;, 1946–65). She was considered a &quot;great scientist and a gracious person&quot; over a career of sixty years.

== Early life ==

Born in Lowell, Massachusetts on August 1, 1905, Helen was the second daughter of banker Edward Everett Sawyer and former teacher Carrie Douglass Sawyer. Academically gifted, Helen graduated from Lowell High School at the age of 15, but chose to stay for another year before leaving to attend Mount Holyoke College in 1922.

== Education ==
After graduating from high school, Hogg enrolled in Mount Holyoke College. Despite having nearly completed a chemistry degree, she changed her major from chemistry to astronomy after attending introductory astronomy classes with Dr. Anne Sewell Young in her junior year (1925). Dr. Sewell took her class to see the solar eclipse of January 24, 1925 and a year later Annie Jump Cannon, an astronomer working at Harvard University, came to visit Mount Holyoke. Hogg cited these experiences as defining moments that led to her career studying stars. In 1926 Hogg completed her undergraduate degree in astronomy, graduating magna cum laude.

After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Hogg received a fellowship for graduate study at Harvard Observatory in the fall of 1926 with the help of Dr. Cannon. Once at Harvard, Hogg worked with Dr. Harlow Shapley, the director of the graduate program in astronomy. Following the expectations and work ethic of Dr. Shapley, Hogg worked hard, long hours measuring the size and brightness of globular clusters and published several papers. Hogg received her master&#x27;s degree in 1928 and her doctoral degree in 1931, both from Radcliffe College, as Harvard refused to award graduate degrees in science to women at the time.

For her advances in astronomy, Hogg received honorary doctoral degrees from six Canadian and U.S. Universities, including Mount Holyoke College and the University of Toronto.

==Scientific works==

While completing her doctoral degree, Hogg taught astronomy at Mount Holyoke and at Smith College. After graduation she moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where she began research at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. Hogg began taking photos of variable stars with the 72-inch reflecting telescope, cataloguing the cyclical changes in the brightness of the variable stars. At the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, Hogg found 132 new variable stars in the globular cluster Messier 2. Hogg published this groundbreaking work in astronomical catalogues that are still used today. Notably, Hogg accomplished all of this as a volunteer assistant to her husband, as the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory would not offer her a job.

In 1935 Hogg moved to the University of Toronto, after her husband had received a job offer to work at the David Dunlap Observatory. For her first year there, Hogg continued her work photographing globular clusters, amassing thousands of photographs which she used to identify many thousands of variable stars. She published &quot;Catalogue of 1116 Variable Stars in Globular Clusters&quot; in 1939, the first of three catalogues she completed, with a fourth in the works at the time of her death. In addition to her work on variable stars in globular clusters, Hogg used the period-luminosity relationship of Cepheid variable stars (discovered by Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908) to enhance the understanding of the Milky Way Galaxy&#x27;s age, size and structure.

During the late 1930s, Hogg became one of the first astronomers to travel and work around the world to advance her research, as the globular clusters she was observing were best seen from the southern hemisphere.

From 1939 to 1941, Hogg returned to America to serve as the president of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (1939–1941) and the acting chair of Mount Holyoke&#x27;s astronomy department (1940–1941). Upon returning to the David Dunlap Observatory, she took on teaching duties at the University of Toronto, largely as a result of male staff being away due to World War II. Retaining her position after the men returned from war, Hogg advanced to assistant professor in 1951, associate professor in 1955, full professor in 1957, and professor emerita in 1976 upon her retirement. Over her research career Hogg published more than 200 papers, and was a leading authority in astronomy.

==Scientific advocacy, awareness, and service==
Not limiting herself to publishing her astronomical specialty of variable stars in globular clusters, Hogg published on the history of astronomy through her column &quot;Out of Old Books&quot;, which was published in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. She was also known for the 30 years she spent writing her weekly column &quot;With the Stars&quot;, which was published in the Toronto Star. In addition, Hogg popularized astronomy with her book &quot;The Stars Belong to Everyone&quot; in 1976, an eight-show television series on Canadian educational television in 1970, and her role as founding president of the Canadian Astronomical Society. She also actively supported women to pursue science.

In addition to her advocacy and awareness work, &quot;Helen presided over several Canadian astronomical and scientific organizations&quot;, and &quot;served on the board of directors of Bell Telephone Company of Canada from 1968 to 1978&quot;. She was also the director of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s astronomy program, and in this position she &quot;helped determine sites for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and for Kitt Peak National Observatory&quot; in 1955. In 1960, &quot;she became the first woman president of the physical sciences section of the Royal Society of Canada&quot;, as well as &quot;the first female president of the Royal Canadian Institute (1964–1965)&quot;.

== Personal life ==

In 1930, she married Frank Scott Hogg, an astronomy student at Harvard, and the two moved to Victoria, British Columbia in 1931. She gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Sally, in June 1932. Hogg was able to continue her observation work by bringing her sleeping daughter with her to the observatory at night in a basket. The observatory&#x27;s director, Dr. J.S. Plaskett, also was supportive; he gave Helen Sawyer Hogg a research grant of $200, which she used to hire a full-time housekeeper for an entire year, providing further support for her research work.

In 1935, the couple moved to Ontario to work at the University of Toronto&#x27;s David Dunlap Observatory, where the couple&#x27;s second child, David, was born in January 1936, followed shortly by their third child, James, in September 1937. Frank died in 1951 of a heart attack, and Helen picked up many of his professional responsibilities in addition to raising their three children. In 1985, Helen married F.E.L. Priestley, a colleague and professor emeritus of English at the University of Toronto, who died in 1988.

Helen Sawyer Hogg died of a heart attack on January 28, 1993, in Richmond Hill, Ontario. An obituary written about Hogg&#x27;s contributions to physics and astronomy was printed in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada&quot;.

<doc id="320237" wikidata="Q92564" url="?curid=320237" title="The Eternaut">
<text>The Eternaut () is a science fiction Argentine comic created by Héctor Germán Oesterheld with artwork by Francisco Solano López. It was first published in &quot;Hora Cero Semanal&quot; between 1957 and 1959, initially published as a serialized comic strip. The story is focused on a handful of survivors of a deadly alien invasion in Buenos Aires.

After other failed attempts to continue the story, Oesterheld made a remake in 1969, with art by Alberto Breccia and a more overt political tone. Oesterheld became the spokesman of the Montoneros guerrilla by the time he started the sequel, &quot;El Eternauta: segunda parte&quot;, again with Solano López. The Dirty War against guerrilla groups forced Oesterheld to go into hiding, but he completed the story nonetheless. He was a victim of an enforced disappearance shortly after that. His widow Elsa Oesterheld sold the rights of the character to the publisher Ediciones Record, and tried later to annul the contract, leading to a lengthy copyright dispute.

The story had many sequels in later years, sometimes with conflicting canonicity. Netflix announced the release of a miniseries in 2020 based on the comic, &quot;The Eternaut&quot;, starring Ricardo Darín as the lead character.

==Publication history==

The &quot;Eternauta&quot; was first published in the first issue of the comic book anthology &quot;Hora Cero&quot; by Editorial Frontera, on September 4, 1957. It was written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld, author of all the comics in the anthology, and was illustrated by Francisco Solano López. Solano López had been working with Oesterheld on the comic (), and although he was still interested in science fiction, he asked for a story with less fantasy. &quot;I was doing Rolo in Hora Cero, I wanted to do science fiction, but with a more realistic approach, something more committed, closer to the reader, and that gave Héctor the idea of the Eternaut&quot;. Oesterheld would explain that &quot;The Eternaut started as a short story, just 70 panels. Then it turned into a long story, an adaptation of sorts of the topic of Robinson Crusoe. I was captivated by the idea of a family that is suddenly alone in the world, surrounded by death and by an unknown and unreachable enemy. I thought of myself, of my family, isolated in our chalet, and started asking questions&quot;. He also explained that, although there was a general outline, the plots were largely improvised during publication, which led to the creation of characters and situations that were not considered in the early stages of writing.

The series became a success, and ran until 1959. However, Solano López said that, although the comic was selling well, they had no way to measure the popularity of each specific comic, and were not aware of the Eternaut&#x27;s popularity at the time. &quot;Hora Cero&quot; was closed shortly after the story&#x27;s conclusion, as artists found it more lucrative to work abroad than in Frontera, Oesterheld knew little of finances, and interest in serial comics declined. Editorial Frontera was then absorbed by Editorial Emilio Ramírez. The closure of Frontera and the emigration of Solano López to Europe forced Oesterheld to cancel his plans for a sequel. Emilio Ramírez then sold the titles to the magazine &quot;Vea y lea&quot; in 1961, which republished the story. The republication made slight changes to the originals, removing the opening panels and some closing panels whose texts were redundant with the texts of the following entry, to allow a smoother read. Oesterheld wrote the plots intended for the sequel as a novel, which was published by Emilio Ramírez.

In 1969, Oesterheld rebooted the series as &quot;The Eternaut 1969&quot;, with more political references. It became an open critique of dictatorial regimes and advanced anti-imperialist ideas: instead of a classic alien invasion that destroys all the world, the story states that the global powers abandoned Latin America to the invaders to guarantee their own survival. This version featured artwork by Alberto Breccia, who drew the story in an experimental and unique style diverging from the original expression. It was first published on May 29, 1969 in the weekly &quot;Gente&quot;. The story was cancelled, so the ending was rushed to avoid leaving it unfinished. The following years the series was also published in Europe. This publications were a success and made Oesterheld, Breccia, and the character known in Europe.

Oesterheld met Lito Fernández in the early 1970s and invited him to work on a sequel set in La Plata. The basic plot would have been about the aliens starting a new invasion elsewhere after their defeat in Buenos Aires, using La Plata as a beachhead from where to raise a counter-attack. The comic would have been published by El Día. Oesterheld and Fernández gathered information about the city, and flew in a helicopter above it to take photos and brainstorm ideas. However, the project was never published and the few unpublished pages made for it were destroyed years later.

In December 1975, Ediciones Record started a sequel in &quot;Skorpio&quot;, by Ediciones Record, titles &quot;El Eternauta: segunda parte&quot;. Oesterheld resumed the story, with artwork once again by Solano López. Solano López had returned to Argentina, seeking to retrieve his original artworks from Emilio Ramírez. Oesterheld joined the leftist organization Montoneros and became their spokesman, and went into hiding when the organization was banned during the Dirty War. To keep writing the comic he delivered the plots in secrecy or using intermediaries. Solano López only saw him in person a couple of times. The plot of the comic was in line with the political agenda of Montoneros. Oesterheld, who had introduced himself as a character in a brief cameo at the beginning and end of the original story, now upgraded his self-character to an active sidekick of the hero, while keeping the role of narrator. Solano López did not like it because he rejected both the military government and the Montoneros, and felt that the characterization of Juan Salvo was out-of-character in relation to the first entry. Oesterheld was victim of an enforced disappearance in 1977, shortly after concluding the story. Elsa Sánchez de Oesterheld, his widow, inherited the rights over the character after his death.

A third story, &quot;El Eternauta: tercera parte&quot;, was published in 1981, after the death of Oesterheld. It was published both in Argentina in &quot;Skorpio&quot; and in Italy in &quot;L&#x27;Eternauta&quot;. Ediciones Record requested Solano López to take part in it, but he refused because of the troubling circumstances of the previous comic. He only agreed to draw a few faces in the first chapters, because of the editorial insistence. The story had no credited authors, and although it kept Oesterheld as a lead narrator character as in the 1975 story, it was written by Alberto Ongaro, with illustrations by Oswal, Mario Morhain, and Carlos Meglia. Some years later Ediciones Record found an unpublished draft of a third part of The Eternaut by Oesterheld, written in the 1970s. Alfredo Scutti, director of Ediciones Record, offered to Pez, an artist from the &quot;Fierro&quot; magazine, to work on it. The story featured Juan Salvo as the ruthless dictator of a post-apocalyptic Buenos Aires, until he gradually recovers his memories. It would have been published monthly, but after a brief time the work was halted and the comic was never published.

Solano López began projects to restore the character in the 1990s. His first project, when he was still living in Brazil, was with the writer Ricardo Barreiro, but was discarded when Sánchez de Oesterheld and her grandsons refused to let the writer work with the character. The second project, called &quot;La Vencida&quot;, was a new third part that would ignore the third part published by Ediciones Record. He invited the writer Juan Sasturain to work together with his protégé Pablo Maiztegui, but Sasturain preferred to work alone. First it was offered to the newspaper Clarín, which refused it for its ideological tone. Then it was offered to the newspaper Página 12, which could not pay the intended wages to the artists. Both newspapers refused as well because The Eternaut was still a property of Ediciones Record, and wanted to avoid a lawsuit. The project was cancelled, with only two pages made.

Sánchez de Oesterheld and Solano López signed a contract with El Club del Comic to make a new story, &quot;El mundo arrepentido&quot;. The story was written by Pablo Maiztegui and was set within the interdimensional travels mentioned by the lead character at the end of the first story. It was the first one made in color. Comic Press, owned by Ediciones Record, also started a comic book, &quot;Odio Cósmico&quot;, closer to the style of American comic books, with plots of Ricardo Barreiro. The death of Barreiro and the legal complaints of Sánchez de Oesterheld and Solano López, who did not authorize the comic, led to its cancellation after 3 issues.

In 2015, Fantagraphics Books published the first translation of the work into English, under the title &quot;The Eternaut&quot;. It was translated by Erica Mena. The publication was nominated for the 2016 Eisner Award in the categories for Best U.S. Edition of International Material, Best Publication Design, and Best Archival Collection/Project—Strips. It received the award in the last category.

===Copyright disputes===

Héctor Oesterheld sold the copyright of several of his characters, including the Eternaut, when Editorial Frontera was closed. Initially those rights were acquired by Editorial Emilio Ramírez, who then sold them to others. Alfredo Scutti from Ediciones Record acquired the rights in the 1970 decade and republished the story in 1976. Oesterheld and Solano López signed a contract with Scutti, confirming his rights over the character, in exchange for part of the money perceived by Ediciones Record for the republication. As it was a success, they signed a similar contract to write the sequel, &quot;El Eternauta Segunda Parte&quot;. Oesterheld was killed by the military and Solano López left for Europe shortly after the sequel was finished. The heirs of Oesterheld were his widow Elsa Sánchez de Oesterheld and his grandchildren, still minors.

The series was a success in Italy and there were rumors of a possible film adaptation. To secure his rights Scutti signed a more detailed contract with Sánchez de Oesterheld. She was facing a difficult economic situation, coupled with the still recent loss of her husband and her imminent age of retirement, and accepted. She signed the contract for a sum of 10,000 dollars. She started a judicial case to annul the contract, as she felt later that she had made a mistake and had not understood what she was doing. Her lawyer said that did not have the legal right to sell the rights over the character, as she ignored the rights of Oesterheld&#x27;s grandchildren. Scutti based his defense on the contracts signed with Héctor while he was still alive, earlier than the one with Sánchez de Oesterheld, and considered that she was mixing commercial deals with personal tragedies. He also provided documentation proving that she authorized the making of the third sequel for another payment.

Solano López also complained about the contract, claiming that it ignored his own rights over the character. When he left for Europe, knowing of Sánchez de Oesterheld&#x27;s economic problems, he told her that he gave her full leeway to profit from the character the way she saw fit. He clarified later that he never meant to renounce his share of the copyright over the character, and that it was only a verbal proposal with no legal weight. He pointed out that the document made between Ediciones Record and Sánchez de Oesterheld described &quot;The Eternaut&quot; as a literary work, created solely by Héctor Oesterheld, with no mention of him. And, although Oesterheld would write a literary novel about the character later, it was born as a comic book character, with a joint work of the writer and the artist. Sánchez de Oesterheld did not agree with that view and considered Solano López a mere interpreter of the work of her husband. She also said that &quot;The Eternaut&quot; was an idea that Oesterheld had for some years before he started working on it. The comic &quot;El mundo arrepentido&quot;, made by Solano López and Pol, was also initially a source of conflict. Oesterheld&#x27;s grandsons said that new projects involving the character, such as sequels, merchandising, or adaptations, had to have the approval of Solano López, but that he did not have the right to decide such things completely by himself. Both parties eventually agreed to work together in the new release.

The judiciary ruled in 1996 that the sale of the characters of Oesterheld to Emilio Ramírez was null and void, restoring them to Oesterheld&#x27;s heirs. Ediciones Record started their own case, stating that they owned the rights to the franchise. Although initially the lower courts ruled favorably to Ediciones Record, in 2018 the Supreme Court ruled favorably to the heirs of Oesterheld and closed the case, with the vote of Ricardo Lorenzetti, Elena Highton de Nolasco, Juan Carlos Maqueda, Horacio Rosatti and Carlos Rosenkrantz.

==Series==

==Plot==
Oesterheld, the author of the comic, appears as a character at the beginning of the story. He is writing late at night when a man suddenly appears out of thin air in his room. He introduces himself as Juan Salvo, and narrates his story. All the comic is thus narrated by Salvo, in first-person narrative. Salvo lived with his wife Elena and his daughter Martita. According to Salvo, mysterious deadly snowfall suddenly covers Buenos Aires and his neighborhood in the nearby Vicente López, wiping out all life upon touch. Salvo and his family survive because his home was completely closed. At the time of the snowfall, he was playing truco with his friends, Favalli, Lucas, and Polski. Polski tries to return to his home, worried about his family, and dies moments after leaving, having come into contact with the snowflakes. The others prepare insulated suits to be able to leave the house and gather supplies. A young child, Pablo, joins them, and a deranged survivor kills Lucas. Realizing that the catastrophe generated a violent state of anarchy, they try to escape from Buenos Aires, but before doing so they are recruited by an improvised army. Salvo, Favalli, and Pablo join them, while Elena and Martita stay home.

It turns out that the snowfall was part of an ongoing alien invasion. The army first attacks a group of giant insects similar to beetles, armed with giant lightthrowers, at the General Paz highway. All beetles have devices on their necks that reveal that the real invaders control them from afar. The army sets its base inside the River Plate stadium, as its enormous walls could serve as a trench against the lightthrowers. Salvo and Franco, a metal worker recruited by the army, leave the stadium during the night to gather intelligence. They discover that the beetles are controlled by an alien known as &quot;Hand&quot;, because of their hands with several fingers. The &quot;Hand&quot; also controls other survivors turned into automatons by a similar device. The alien is in turn also controlled by aliens that he does not name; later referred to as just &quot;Them&quot;. The army is then lured into a trap at Plaza Italia. They are decimated by giant beasts known as &quot;Gurbos&quot;, and only Salvo, Favalli and Franco survive. They seek further intelligence and find the main invasion at the Plaza del Congreso. They blow up the dome with &quot;Them&quot; and escape; they find Pablo and the historian Mosca, who survived the attack at Plaza Italia but got separated from them. They leave just before a nuke fired by foreign countries against the invaders destroys Buenos Aires. 

The aliens continue the invasion and lure the pockets of survivors to fake &quot;snow-free zones&quot;. Favalli, Pablo and Mosca allow themselves to be captured and turned into automatons so that Salvo and his family can escape. They seize a spaceship and Salvo accidentally turns on a time machine while randomly pressing buttons. He ends up in a pocket universe, with Elena and Martita stranded somewhere else. He eventually learns to travel between universes and timelines, which is why he appeared at Oesterheld&#x27;s house. After finishing his narration Salvo realizes that he is in Buenos Aires, only a few years before the invasion. He runs back home, reunites with his family in a stable time loop, and forgets about it all. Oesterheld, unable to do anything else about the future invasion, decides to write a comic about it.

==Reception==
Martín Hadis wrote in the prologue for the Fantagraphics edition that one of the strongest points of the story for the Argentine audience was the sight of an alien invasion in Buenos Aires, with its distinctive buildings and monuments disfigured or destroyed by the alien devices or the war actions; most works of fiction about the theme are set in other countries, such as the United States. However, he also pointed out that the story has appeal beyond that, as it has been successful in Spain, Mexico, Italy, Greece, Croatia, France, etc; where the sight of Buenos Aires would be less meaningful. He points that the scientific aspects of the alien invasion are mostly handwaved and that the story narrates a global disaster from the point of view of a small group of survivors. Hadis explains the appeal of the series in the contrast between home, family and friendship with death and the utterly alien, an appeal that would transcend localisms. Rachel Cooke from &quot;The Guardian&quot; praises the ingenuity of the characters to survive truly hopeless situations.

It has also been noted that, except for the aliens known as &quot;Them&quot;, none of the invaders are truly evil; they are noble beings forced to carry out the orders of others. Juan Sasturain believes that Oesterheld was writing an anti-war comic, and Fernando García considers it instead an allegory of class struggle. Tom Shapira from &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; says that, adding to the frequent in-story references to &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, he found the story similar to &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, as it features a hero who is actually a witness of the acts of heroism carried out by others.

Shapira also criticized some aspects of the story, such as the presence of flying saucers that he found to make the story look dated. He also criticized the lack of relevant female characters, stating that Elena and Martita had no actual weight in the plot save as reminders for the protagonist of the family he longs for. Shapira additionally criticized what he perceived as the over-reliance on cliffhangers, while also noting that the story was initially published in serialized form, which left several cliffhangers at the moments when the original publication likely ended the chapters.

&quot;El Eternauta: primera parte&quot; was listed among the classics of Argentine literature in 2000 by Clarín. In 2009, the Congress of Argentina declared 4 September, the day of the first publication of &quot;The Eternaut&quot;, &quot;Day of the Argentine Comic&quot;; in 2010, the Argentine Ministry of Education ordered several thousand copies of &quot;The Eternaut&quot; to be distributed in secondary schools.

President Néstor Kirchner expressed his admiration for &quot;The Eternaut&quot;; in 2010, Kirchner ran an advertisement of himself drawn as the Eternaut in support of Cristina Kirchner&#x27;s presidential campaign. The advertising, known as the &quot;Nestornauta&quot;, was later used after the death of Néstor Kirchner a short time later. The &quot;Nestornauta&quot; is based upon one of the best known images of the character, used in the front cover of the 1976 reissue of the first story. The image keeps the snow flakes around the character, but removes the shotgun, as it could be associated with the violent guerrillas of the 1970s. It also changed the face of the character: besides using the face of Kirchner, it changes the grim and determined gesture of the original with a jovial and smiling face.

==Adaptations==
In 1968, advertisement production company Gil &amp; Bertolini acquired the rights to &quot;The Eternaut&quot; to make an animated television series, to be presented at the First World Comic Book Biennial. Each episode would be introduced by Oesterheld himself, and the animation would be rotoscoped, a very expensive technique at the time. The project was cancelled after the production of a 24-minute pilot.

For the following twenty years, financial and copyrights problems prevented different adaptations of &quot;The Eternaut&quot; for film and television. Argentine directors such as Fernando &quot;Pino&quot; Solanas and Gustavo Mosquera expressed their interest on adapting the material, as did Adolfo Aristarain. At the time, Aristarain said that the only way to produce the film would be in English, given it would cost at least US$10–15million and American actors would be conditional to get the necessary funds from American production companies, but &quot;that wouldn&#x27;t be the correct way&quot; because he considered Argentine culture an integral part of &quot;The Eternaut&quot;.

In 1995, there was a miniseries project led by a TV network from Buenos Aires, with special effects in charge of computer animation company Aicon. A preliminary contract had been signed with a major Hollywood studio. In 2007, an Italian production company worked on an adaptation of &quot;The Eternaut&quot;, in agreement with Oesterheld&#x27;s widow and grandsons. It entered negotiations with Argentine studios and the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts (INCAA) for a possible co-production. In 2008, director Lucrecia Martel was invited for a film adaptation of &quot;The Eternaut&quot;. The script would have taken place in the present day, but the Oesterheld family felt it to be too different from the source material. The producers stepped down and the project went stagnant. In 2018, Spanish filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia expressed interest in making an adaptation, with actor Ricardo Darín on board to star in the project.

In February 2020, it was announced that &quot;The Eternaut&quot; would be adapted into a TV series for Netflix, &quot;The Eternaut&quot;. The series will be directed by Bruno Stagnaro and will be contextualized in the present. Ricardo Darín will play the main character, and the cast also features Carla Peterson, Marcelo Subiotto, César Troncoso, Andrea Pietra and .

<text>The United States Army Special Forces (SF), colloquially known as the &quot;Green Berets&quot; due to their distinctive service headgear, is a branch of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).

The core missionset of Special Forces contains five doctrinal missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, counterterrorism, and special reconnaissance. The unit emphasizes language, cultural, and training skills in working with foreign troops; recruits are required to learn a foreign language as part of their training and must maintain knowledge of the political, economic, and cultural complexities of the regions in which they are deployed. Other Special Forces missions, known as secondary missions, include combat search and rescue (CSAR), counter-narcotics, hostage rescue, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian demining, peacekeeping, and manhunts. Other components of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) or other U.S. government activities may also specialize in these secondary missions. The Special Forces conduct these missions via five active duty groups, each with a geographic specialization; and two National Guard groups that share multiple geographic areas of responsibility. Many of their operational techniques are classified, but some nonfiction works and doctrinal manuals are available.

Special Forces have a longstanding and close relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, tracing their lineage back to the Agency&#x27;s predecessors in the OSS and First Special Service Force. The Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s (CIA) highly secretive Special Activities Center, and more specifically its Special Operations Group (SOG), recruits from U.S. Army Special Forces. Joint CIA–Army Special Forces operations go back to the unit MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and were seen as recently as the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021).

==Mission==
The primary mission of the Army Special Forces is to train and lead unconventional warfare (UW) forces, or a clandestine guerrilla force in an occupied nation. The 10th Special Forces Group was the first deployed SF unit, intended to train and lead UW forces behind enemy lines in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe. As the U.S. became involved in Southeast Asia, it was realized that specialists trained to lead guerrillas could also help defend against hostile guerrillas, so SF acquired the additional mission of Foreign Internal Defense (FID), working with Host Nation (HN) forces in a spectrum of counter-guerrilla activities from indirect support to combat command.

Special Forces personnel qualify both in advanced military skills and the regional languages and cultures of defined parts of the world. While they are best known for their unconventional warfare capabilities, they also undertake other missions that include direct action raids, peace operations, counter-proliferation, counter-drug advisory roles, and other strategic missions. As strategic resources, they report either to USSOCOM or to a regional Unified Combatant Command. To enhance their DA capability, specific units were created with a focus on the direct action side of special operations. First known as Commander&#x27;s In-extremis Force, then Crisis Response Forces, they are now supplanted by Hard-Target Defeat companies which have been renamed Critical Threats Advisory Companies.

SF team members work closely together and rely on one another under isolated circumstances for long periods of time, both during extended deployments and in garrison. SF non-commissioned officers (NCO) often spend their entire careers in Special Forces, rotating among assignments to detachments, higher staff billets, liaison positions, and instructor duties at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. With the creation of USSOCOM, SF commanders have risen to the highest ranks of U.S. Army command, including command of USSOCOM, the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

==History==


In 1951, Major General Robert A. McClure chose former World War Two OSS member Colonel Aaron Bank as Operations Branch Chief of the Special Operations Division of the Psychological Warfare Staff in the Pentagon. In June 1952 the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was formed under Bank, soon after the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which eventually became John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was then split with the cadre that kept the designation 10th SFG deployed to Bad Tölz, Germany, in September 1953. The remaining part at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group, which in May 1960 was reorganized and designated as today&#x27;s 7th Special Forces Group.

Since their establishment in 1952, Special Forces soldiers have operated in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, 1st Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines, Syria, Yemen, Niger and, in a FID role, East Africa.

The Special Forces branch was established as a basic branch of the United States Army on 9 April 1987 by Department of the Army General Order No. 35.

==Organizational structure==
 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne)
===Special Forces Groups===

In 1957 the two original special forces groups (10th and 77th) were joined by the 1st SFG, stationed in the Far East. Additional groups were formed in 1961 and 1962 after President John F. Kennedy visited the Special Forces at Fort Bragg in 1961. The 5th SFG was activated on 21 September 1961; the 8th SFG on 1 April 1963; the 6th SFG on 1 May 1963; and the 3rd SFG on 5 December 1963. In addition, there have been seven Reserve groups (2nd SFG, 9th SFG, 11th SFG, 12th SFG, 13th SFG, 17th SFG, and 24th SFG) and four National Guard groups (16th SFG, 19th SFG, 20th SFG, and 21st SFG). A 4th SFG, 14th SFG, 15th SFG, 18th SFG, 22nd SFG, and 23rd SFG were in existence at some point. Many of these groups were not fully staffed and most were deactivated around 1966.

In the early twenty-first century, Special Forces are divided into five active duty and two Army National Guard (ARNG) Special Forces groups. Each Special Forces Group (SFG) has a specific regional focus. The Special Forces soldiers assigned to these groups receive intensive language and cultural training for countries within their regional area of responsibility. Due to the increased need for Special Forces soldiers in the War on Terror, all groups—including those of the National Guard (19th and 20th SFGs)—have been deployed outside of their areas of operation, particularly to Iraq and Afghanistan. A recently released report showed Special Forces as perhaps the most deployed SOF under USSOCOM, with many soldiers, regardless of group, serving up to 75% of their careers overseas, almost all of which had been to Iraq and Afghanistan.

Until 2014, an SF group has consisted of three battalions, but since the Department of Defense has authorized the 1st Special Forces Command to increase its authorized strength by one third, a fourth battalion was activated in each active component group.
A Special Forces group is historically assigned to a Unified Combatant Command or a theater of operations. The Special Forces Operational Detachment C or C-detachment (SFODC) is responsible for a theater or a major subcomponent, which can provide command and control of up to 18 SFODAs, three SFODB, or a mixture of the two. Subordinate to it is the Special Forces Operational Detachment Bs or B-detachments (SFODB), which can provide command and control for six SFODAs. Further subordinate, the SFODAs typically raise company- to battalion-sized units when on unconventional warfare missions. They can form six-man &quot;split A&quot; detachments that are often used for special reconnaissance.

===Battalion Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-C (SFODC) composition===
The SFODC, or &quot;C-Team&quot;, is the headquarters element of a Special Forces battalion. As such, it is a command and control unit with operations, training, signals, and logistic support responsibilities to its three subordinate line companies. A lieutenant colonel commands the battalion as well as the C-Team, and the Battalion Command Sergeant Major is the senior NCO of the battalion and the C-Team. There are an additional 20–30 SF personnel who fill key positions in operations, logistics, intelligence, communications, and medical. A Special Forces battalion usually consists of four companies: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and Headquarters/Support.

===Company Headquarters Element – SF Operational Detachment-B (SFODB) composition===
The ODB, or &quot;B-Team&quot;, is the headquarters element of a Special Forces company, and it is usually composed of 11–13 soldiers. While the A-team typically conducts direct operations, the purpose of the B-Team is to support the company&#x27;s A-Teams both in garrison and in the field. The B-Teams are numbered similarly to A-Teams (see below), but the fourth number in the sequence is a 0. For example, ODB 5210 would be 5th Special Forces Group, 2nd Battalion, A Company&#x27;s ODB.

The ODB is led by an 18A, usually a major, who is the company commander (CO). The CO is assisted by his company executive officer (XO), another 18A, usually a captain. The XO is himself assisted by a company technician, a 180A, generally, a chief warrant officer three, who assists in the direction of the organization, training, intelligence, counter-intelligence, and operations for the company and its detachments. The company commander is assisted by a senior non-commissioned officer, an 18Z, usually a sergeant major. A second 18Z acts as the operations sergeant, usually a master sergeant, who assists the XO and technician in their operational duties. He has an 18F assistant operations sergeant, who is usually a sergeant first class. The company&#x27;s support comes from an 18D medical sergeant, usually a sergeant first class, and two 18E communications sergeants, usually a sergeant first class and a staff sergeant.

Support positions as part of the ODB/B Team within an SF Company are as follows:
* The supply NCO, usually a Staff Sergeant, the commander&#x27;s principal logistical planner, works with the battalion S-4 to supply the company.
* The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN defense) NCO, usually a Sergeant, maintains and operates the company&#x27;s NBC detection and decontamination equipment, and assists in administering NBC defensive measures.
* Other jobs can also exist depending on the B-Team structure. Specialist team members can include I.T. (S-6) personnel, and Military Intelligence Soldiers, including Intelligence Analysts (35F), Human Intelligence Collectors (35M), Signals Intelligence (35 N/P - also known as SOT-A and SOT-B as related to their positions on SFODA and SFODB teams), Intelligence Officers (35 D/E/F), and Counterintelligence Special Agents (35L/351L).

=== Basic Element – SF Operational Detachment-A (SFODA) composition===
A Special Forces company normally consists of six Operational Detachments-A (ODA or &quot;A-Teams&quot;). Each ODA specializes in an infiltration skill or a particular mission-set (e.g. military free fall (HALO), combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, etc.). Each ODA Team&#x27;s number is unique. Prior to 2007, the number typically consisted of three digits, reflecting the Group, the specific ODB within the battalion, and the specific ODA within the company. Starting in 2007, the number sequence was changed to a four-digit format. The first digit would specify group (1=1st SFG, 3=3rd SFG, 5=5th SF, 7=7th SFG, 0=10th SFG, 9=19th SFG, 2=20th SFG). The second digit would be 1-4 for 1st through 4th Battalion. The third digit would be 1-3 for A to C Companies. The fourth digit would be 1-6 for the particular team within that company. For example, ODA 1234 would signify the fourth ODA in Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group.

An ODA consists of 12 soldiers, each of whom has a specific function (MOS or Military Occupational Specialty) on the team; however, all members of an ODA conduct cross-training. The ODA is led by an 18A (Detachment Commander), a captain, and a 180A (Assistant Detachment Commander) who is their second in command, usually a Warrant Officer One or Chief Warrant Officer Two. The team also includes the following enlisted soldiers: one 18Z (Operations Sergeant) (known as the &quot;Team Sergeant&quot;), usually a Master Sergeant, one 18F (Assistant Operations and Intelligence Sergeant), usually a Sergeant First Class, and two each, 18Bs (Weapons Sergeant), 18Cs (Engineer Sergeant), 18Ds (Medical Sergeant), and 18Es (Communications Sergeant), usually Sergeants First Class, Staff Sergeants, or Sergeants. This organization facilitates 6-man &quot;split team&quot; operations, redundancy, and mentoring between a senior NCO and their junior assistant.

==Qualifications==


The basic eligibility requirements to be considered for entry into the Special Forces for existing service members are:

:*Be age 20–36
:*Be a U.S. citizen
:*Be a high school graduate
:*Have Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) placement test GT score of 110 or above
:*Be qualified for Airborne School or Ranger School
:*Pass the Physical Fitness test and meet height and weight standards
:*Be of rank E-3 (Private First Class) or higher
:*Have fewer than 9 months time in grade as E-7 when applying
:*Have no more than 12-14 years in service prior to training and have 36 months or more left in service after completing SF training (if able to)
:*Be eligible for secret clearance

For officers, the requirements are:
:*Be of rank first lieutenant or captain
:*Have a Defense Language Aptitude Battery score of 85 or higher
:*Be eligible for top secret clearance
* Support personnel assigned to a Special Forces unit who do not possess a Special Forces 18-series career management field (CMF) MOS are not &quot;Special Forces qualified&quot;, as they have not completed the Special Forces Qualification Course (SFQC or &quot;Q&quot; Course); however, they do have the potential to be awarded the Special Qualification Identifier (SQI) &quot;S&quot; (Special Operations / Special Operations Support) once they complete the appropriate unit-level training, 24 months with their Special Forces unit, and Basic Airborne School (except for CMF 15).

==Selection and training==
The Special Forces soldier trains on a regular basis over the course of their entire career. The initial formal training program for entry into Special Forces is divided into four phases collectively known as the Special Forces Qualification Course or, informally, the &quot;Q Course&quot;. The length of the Q Course changes depending on the applicant&#x27;s primary job field within Special Forces and their assigned foreign language capability, but will usually last between 55 and 95 weeks. After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses. These include, but are not limited to, the Military Free Fall Parachutist Course, the Combat Diver Qualification Course, the Special Operations Combat Medic Course, the Special Forces Sniper Course, among others.

===Women in the Green Berets===
In 1981 Capt. Kathleen Wilder became the first woman to qualify for the Green Berets. She was told she had failed a field exercise just before graduation, but she filed a sex discrimination complaint, and it was determined that she &quot;had been wrongly denied graduation.&quot; Wilder, a former military intelligence officer, was ultimately allowed to wear the Special Forces Tab when it was created in 1983, and continued to do so over her 28-year career until she retired as a lieutenant colonel. Army Times reported that in July 2020, the first woman to complete the Army Special Forces Qualification Course graduated and moved on to a Green Beret team.

==Special Forces MOS descriptions==
* 18A – Special Forces Officer
* 180A – Special Forces Warrant Officer
* 18B – Special Forces Weapons Sergeant
* 18C – Special Forces Engineer Sergeant
* 18D – Special Forces Medical Sergeant
* 18E – Special Forces Communications Sergeant
* 18F – Special Forces Intelligence Sergeant
* 18X – Special Forces Candidate (Active Duty and National Guard Enlistment Option)
* 18Z – Special Forces Operations Sergeant

==Uniforms and insignia==
===Green beret===

U.S. Army Special Forces adopted the green beret unofficially in 1954 after searching for headgear that would set them visually apart. Members of the 77th SFG began searching through their accumulated berets and settled on the rifle green color from Captain Miguel de la Peña&#x27;s collection; since 1942 the British Commandos had permeated the use of green on berets of specialist forces, and many current international military organisations followed this practice. Captain Frank Dallas had the new beret designed and produced in small numbers for the members of the 10th &amp; 77th Special Forces Groups.

Their new headdress was first worn at a retirement parade at Fort Bragg on 12 June 1955 for Major General Joseph P. Cleland, the now-former commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Onlookers thought that the operators were a foreign delegation from NATO. In 1956 General Paul D. Adams, the post commander at Fort Bragg, banned the wearing of the distinctive headdress, although members of the Special Forces continued to wear it surreptitiously. This was reversed on 25 September 1961 by Department of the Army Message 578636, which designated the green beret as the exclusive headdress of the Army Special Forces.

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized them for use exclusively by the U.S. Special Forces. Preparing for a 12 October visit to the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the president sent word to the center&#x27;s commander, Colonel William P. Yarborough, for all Special Forces soldiers to wear green berets as part of the event. The president felt that since they had a special mission, Special Forces should have something to set them apart from the rest. In 1962, he called the green beret &quot;a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom.&quot;

Forrest Lindley, a writer for the newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; who served with Special Forces in Vietnam said of Kennedy&#x27;s authorization: &quot;It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret. People were sneaking around wearing [them] when conventional forces weren&#x27;t in the area and it was sort of a cat and mouse game. Then Kennedy authorized the Green Beret as a mark of distinction, everybody had to scramble around to find berets that were really green. We were bringing them down from Canada. Some were handmade, with the dye coming out in the rain.&quot;

Kennedy&#x27;s actions created a special bond with the Special Forces, with specific traditions carried out since his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces soldiers guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin. The moment was repeated at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of JFK&#x27;s death – General Michael D. Healy (ret.), the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam and later a commander of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, spoke at Arlington National Cemetery, after which a wreath in the form of a green beret was placed on Kennedy&#x27;s grave.

===Distinctive unit insignia===

A silver colored metal and enamel device in height consisting of a pair of silver arrows in saltire, points up and is surmounted at their junction by the V-42 stiletto silver dagger with black handle point up; all over and between a black motto scroll arcing to the base and inscribed &quot;DE OPPRESSO LIBER&quot; in silver letters.

The insignia is the crossed arrow collar insignia (insignia of the branch) of the First Special Service Force, World War II combined with the fighting knife which is of a distinctive shape and pattern only issued to the First Special Service Force. The motto is translated as &quot;From Oppression We Will Liberate Them.&quot;

The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 8 July 1960. The insignia of the 1st Special Forces was authorized to be worn by personnel of the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units on 7 March 1991. The wear of the insignia by the U.S. Army Special Forces Command (Airborne) and its subordinate units was canceled and it was authorized to be worn by personnel of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) and their subordinate units which were not authorized a distinctive unit insignia in their own right and amended to change the symbolism on 27 October 2016.

===Shoulder sleeve insignia===

The shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) of the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) is worn by all those assigned to the command and its subordinate units who have not been authorized their own SSI, such as the Special Forces Groups. According to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, the shape and items depicted in the SSI have special meaning: &quot;The arrowhead alludes to the American Indian&#x27;s basic skills in which Special Forces personnel are trained to a high degree. The dagger represents the unconventional nature of Special Forces operations, and the three lightning flashes, their ability to strike rapidly by Sea, Air or Land.&quot; Army Special Forces were the first Special Operations unit to employ the &quot;sea, air, land&quot; concept nearly a decade before units like the Navy SEALs were created.

Before the 1st Special Forces Command SSI was established, the special forces groups that stood up between 1952 and 1955 wore the Airborne Command SSI. According to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry, the Airborne Command SSI was reinstated on 10 April 1952—after being disbanded in 1947—and authorized for wear by certain classified units—such as the newly formed 10th and 77th Special Forces Groups—until the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) SSI was established on 22 August 1955.

===Special Forces Tab===
Introduced in June 1983, the Special Forces Tab is a service school qualification tab awarded to soldiers who complete one of the Special Forces Qualification Courses. Unlike the Green Beret, soldiers who are awarded the Special Forces Tab are authorized to wear it for the remainder of their military careers, even when not serving with an Army Special Forces unit. The cloth tab is a teal blue colored arc tab in length and in height overall, the designation &quot;SPECIAL FORCES&quot; in gold-yellow letters in height and is worn on the left sleeve of utility uniforms above a unit&#x27;s Shoulder Sleeve Insignia and below the President&#x27;s Hundred Tab (if so awarded). The metal Special Forces Tab replica comes in two sizes, full and dress miniature. The full size version measures in height and in width. The miniature version measures in height and in width. Both are teal blue with yellow border trim and letters and are worn above or below ribbons or medals on the Army Service Uniform.

===Camouflage pattern===
During the Vietnam War, the Green Berets of the 5th Special Forces Group wanted camouflage clothing to be made in Tigerstripe. So they contracted with Vietnamese and other Southeast Asian producers to make fatigues and other items such as boonie hats using tigerstripe fabric. When Tigerstripes made a comeback in the 21st century, they were used by Green Berets for OPFOR drills.

From 1981 to the mid-2000s, they had worn the Battle Dress Uniform.

Since the War on Terror, they have worn Universal Camouflage Pattern but phased that out in favor of MultiCam and Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) uniforms.

===Yarborough knife===
This knife was designed and built by Bill Harsey Jr. in collaboration with Chris Reeve Knives. Starting in 2002, all graduates of the qualification course were awarded a Yarborough knife, designed by Bill Harsey and named after Lt. Gen. William Yarborough, considered the father of the modern Special Forces. All knives awarded are individually serial-numbered, and all awardees&#x27; names are recorded in a special logbook.

==Vehicles==
During the Green Berets&#x27; missions in other nations, they would use Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV)-S Humvees made by AM General for various uses. While using purpose built technicals for patrol on rugged terrain which would help preserve the clandestine nature of their missions. They have also had access to the General Dynamics M1288 GMV 1.1 variant of the Army Ground Mobility Vehicle as well as the Oshkosh M-ATV Special Forces variant MRAPs.

For aircraft other than the ones used by the US military and its special forces/special operations forces units, they extensively used the CIA-operated Mi-8 and Mi-17 variants of those military helicopters in Afghanistan during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom.

==Use of the term &quot;Special Forces&quot;==
In countries other than the U.S., the term &quot;special forces&quot; or &quot;special operations forces&quot; (SOF) is often used generically to refer to any units with elite training and special mission sets. In the U.S. military, &quot;Special Forces&quot; is a proper (capitalized) noun referring exclusively to U.S. Army Special Forces (a.k.a. &quot;The Green Berets&quot;). The media and popular culture frequently misapply the term to Navy SEALs and other members of the U.S. Special Operations Forces. As a result, the terms USSF and, less commonly, USASF have been used to specify United States Army Special Forces.

==Use of the term &quot;Operator&quot;==
The term &quot;Operator&quot; pre-dates American Special Operations and can be found in books referring to French Special Operations as far back as WWII. Examples include &quot;A Savage War of Peace&quot; by Alistair Horne and &quot;The Centurions&quot; by Jean Larteguy.

The origin of the term &quot;operator&quot; in American special operations comes from the U.S. Army Special Forces. The Army Special Forces were established in 1952, ten years before the Navy SEALs, and 25 years before Delta Force. Every other modern U.S. special operations unit in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines was established after 1977. In &quot;Veritas: Journal of Army Special Operations History&quot;, Charles H. Briscoe states that the Army &quot;Special Forces did not misappropriate the appellation. Unbeknownst to most members of the Army Special Operations Force community, that moniker was adopted by the Special Forces in the mid-1950s.&quot; He goes on to state that all qualified enlisted and officers in Special Forces had to &quot;voluntarily subscribe to the provisions of the &#x27;Code of the Special Forces Operator&#x27; and pledge themselves to its tenets by witnessed signature.&quot; This pre-dates every other special operations unit that currently uses the term/title operator.

Inside the United States Special Operations community, an &quot;operator&quot; is a Delta Force member who has completed selection and has graduated the Operators Training Course. &quot;Operator&quot; was used by Delta Force to distinguish between operational and non-operational personnel assigned to the unit. Other special operations forces use specific names for their jobs, such as Army &quot;Rangers&quot; and Air Force &quot;Pararescuemen&quot;. The Navy uses the acronym &quot;SEAL&quot; for both their special warfare teams and their individual members, who are also known as &quot;Special Operators&quot;. In 2006 the Navy created &quot;Special Warfare Operator&quot; as a rating specific to Naval Special Warfare enlisted personnel, grades E-4 to E-9 (see Navy special warfare ratings). &quot;Operator&quot; is the specific term for operational personnel, and has become a colloquial term for almost all special operations forces in the U.S. military, as well as around the world.

<text>The list price, also known as the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price (MSRP), or the recommended retail price (RRP), or the suggested retail price (SRP) of a product is the price at which its manufacturer notionally recommends that a retailer sell the product.

Suggested pricing methods may conflict with competition theory, as they allow prices to be set higher than would be established by supply and demand. Resale price maintenance—fixing prices—goes further than suggesting prices, and is illegal in many countries.

Retailers may charge less than the suggested retail price, depending upon the actual wholesale cost of each item, usually purchased in bulk from the manufacturer, or in smaller quantities through a distributor. The suggested price is sometimes unrealistically high, so the seller can appear to be offering a discount. Some retailers apply discount stickers over top of original prices to indicate a discount to consumers.

List price often cannot be compared directly internationally as products may differ in detail, sometimes due to different regulations, and list prices may or may not include taxes.

==India and Bangladesh==
India and Bangladesh do not use list prices but instead have a maximum retail price.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, the list price is referred to as a recommended retail price or RRP.

In 1998, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry prohibited the placing of RRP on electrical goods under the &quot;Domestic Electrical Goods Order&quot;, but this ruling was lifted by the Competition Commission in February 2012.

==United States==
In the United States, the list price is referred to as the manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price or MSRP.

Under earlier US state Fair Trade statutes, the manufacturer was able to impose a fixed price for items. The fixed prices could offer some price protection to small merchants in competition against larger retail organizations. These were determined to be in restraint of trade. Many manufacturers have adopted MSRP, a price at which the manufacturer suggests the item be priced by a retailer. The term &quot;suggested&quot; can be misleading because in many cases, the MSRP is extremely high compared to the actual wholesale cost, opening the market to &quot;deep discounters&quot;, who are able to sell products substantially below the MSRP but still make a profit. The discount stores benefit from exorbitant MSRPs because the discount offered increases the perceived value to customers.

===Automobiles===

A common use for MSRP can be seen in automobile sales in the United States. Prior to the spread of manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail pricing, there were no defined prices on vehicles, and car dealers were able to impose arbitrary markups, often with prices adjusted to what the salesperson thought the prospective purchaser would be willing to pay for a particular vehicle. 

Currently, the MSRP, or &quot;sticker price&quot;, the price of a vehicle as labeled by the manufacturer, is clearly labeled on the windows of all new vehicles, on a Monroney sticker, commonly called the &quot;window sticker&quot;. The sticker was added as part of the Automobile Information Disclosure Act of 1958. The MSRP is different from the actual price paid to the manufacturer by the dealer, which is known as the &quot;invoice price&quot;. There are now numerous sources, such as online appraisal tools, that can be used to find the MSRP and invoice price.

==Minimum advertised price==
MAP, or Minimum Advertised Price, refers to the lowest price a retailer is allowed to advertise a product for sale. It&#x27;s a policy that manufacturers or distributors set to maintain brand identity and to ensure that retailers do not advertise or sell their products at excessively low prices, which can lead to several issues such as: brand devaluation, price erosion and unfair competition.

===United States===
Fixed pricing established between a distributor and seller or between two or more sellers may violate antitrust laws in the United States.

In &quot;Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.&quot;, 127 S. Ct. 2705 (2007), the Supreme Court considered whether federal antitrust law established a &quot;per se&quot; ban on minimum resale price agreements and, instead, allow resale price maintenance agreements to be judged by the rule of reason, the usual standard applied to determine if there is a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. In holding that vertical price restraints should be judged by the rule of reason, the Court overruled &quot;Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.&quot;, 220 U.S. 373 (1911).

Because the rule of reason applies, minimum RPM agreements may still be unlawful. In fact, in &quot;Leegin&quot;, the Court identified at least two ways in which a purely vertical minimum RPM agreement might be illegal. First, &quot;[a] dominant retailer ... might request resale price maintenance to forestall innovation in distribution that decreases costs. A manufacturer might consider it has little choice but to accommodate the retailer&#x27;s demands for vertical price restraints if the manufacturer believes it needs access to the retailer&#x27;s distribution network&quot;. Second, &quot;[a] manufacturer with market power... might use resale price maintenance to give retailers an incentive not to sell the products of smaller rivals or new entrants.&quot;

In both of these examples, an economically powerful firm uses the RPM agreement to exclude or raise entry barriers for its competition.

In addition, federal law is not the only source of antitrust claims as almost all of the states have their own antitrust laws.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, in September 2010, an investigation was launched by the Office of Fair Trading into breaches of competition law by online travel agents and the hotel industry in relation to the advertised pricing of hotel rooms. As of April 2011, this was an administrative priority of the OFT.

===Australia===
In Australia, any sort of attempt at setting minimum advertised pricing or any retaliation against such a reseller is against the Competition and Consumer Act.

It is also illegal for resellers to ask their suppliers to use recommended price lists to stop competitors from discounting. In most cases, a supplier may specify a maximum price for retail.

There is an exception to this where the reseller is engaging in a loss-leading exercise.

==Rack rate==
&#x27;Rack rate&#x27; is the travel industry term for the published full price of a hotel room, which the customer would pay by just walking into the hotel off the street and asking for a room. In some jurisdictions, a customer may be entitled to overstay a reservation by paying the rack rate. While the rack rate can be lower than the maximum rate that the hotel may be allowed to charge under local laws, it is higher than the rate most travel agents can book for their customers. Sometimes the terms &quot;run of the house&quot; or &quot;walk-up rate&quot; (in Europe usually: &quot;walk-in rate&quot;) are used to refer to the same highest rate.

The term &quot;rack rate&quot; is also used by travel-related service providers, such as car rental companies or travel mobile phone rental companies, to refer to the same highest rate that customers would be charged with no prebookings.

<doc id="320251" wikidata="Q6950622" url="?curid=320251" title="Māori Television Service">
<text>The Māori Television Service ( MTS; ) is a state sector organisation in New Zealand that was established on 7 May 2003 under the Māori Television Service (Te Aratuku Whakaata Irirangi Māori) Act 2003 to replace the Te Reo Māori Television Trust (Te Awhiorangi). The service&#x27;s primary function is to promote the language te reo Māori me nga tikanga Māori.

Like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the television service has, according to the State Services Commission, an unusual status as a stand-alone agency within the State sector that does not fall under any State sector category. While established by statute (the Maori Television Service Act 2003), it is not a Crown entity in any shape or form. The Act, however, does make the Service accountable in much the same way as Crown entities. The principal reason for this approach is that the Maori Television Service is a partnership between the Crown and Maori. Maori interests were represented by Te Putahi Paho (the Maori Electoral College) who appointed four members of the Television Service&#x27;s seven member board. The remaining three board members were appointed by the Government. Now Māori interests are represented by Te Mātāwai (a legislative group comprising representatives from Māori organisations and iwi).

The Maori Television Service receives the bulk of its funding from the government via Vote Maori Affairs. Funding is provided directly to the service for its operational administrative costs. Programming is funded by Te Mangai Paho (The Maori Broadcasting Commission). The Service is able to commission its own programming from advertising funds.

Māori Television started broadcasting in 2004. It was renamed Whakaata Māori in 2022. It is available on the UHF band to approximately four-fifths of Māori speakers, and to all New Zealand SKY Television satellite service subscribers. It is also available on the Freeview satellite service.

<doc id="320258" wikidata="Q1148315" url="?curid=320258" title="List of state-owned enterprises of New Zealand">
<text>State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in New Zealand are registered companies listed under Schedules 1 and 2 of the &quot;State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986&quot;. Most SOEs are former government departments or agencies that were corporatised. They are responsible to the Minister for State Owned Enterprises.

Many other government-owned companies and statutory trading organisations are referred to informally as &quot;state-owned enterprises&quot; although they are not SOEs in the strictest sense. These are also listed here.

==Function==
The function of SOEs is to operate successfully as a business, as profitable as those not owned by the Crown. The section of the Act defining this is usually interpreted as meaning that SOEs are expected to ready themselves for privatisation, though this is not always the case.

Two Ministers of the Crown act as the shareholding ministers in the company. In the case of SOEs these are usually the Minister for State Owned Enterprises (see article for list) and the Minister responsible for the particular company.

The Crown is assisted in the running of SOEs and other Crown-owned companies by the Treasury&#x27;s Commercial Operations group (formerly the Crown Ownership Monitoring Unit).

==List of state enterprises==
The state enterprises are listed in Schedule 1 of the State-owned Enterprises Act.
==State-(part-)owned enterprises==

The following table lists entities that are monitored by Treasury, but are not state enterprises (see table above). For a more complete list of government entities and organisations, see Public sector organisations in New Zealand.

==Former state-owned enterprises==
Former state-owned enterprises come in three forms – those removed from the Schedules of the Act and made Crown entities, those removed and not privatised, and those removed and privatised. Well-known SOEs that became Crown entity companies include broadcasting companies Television New Zealand (TVNZ) and Radio New Zealand (RNZ).
* Timberlands West Coast Limited, wound up in 2008
* Learning Media Limited, wound up in 2013
* Solid Energy, wound up in 2018

===Privatised state-owned enterprises===
Privatised state-owned enterprises include:
* Bank of New Zealand (BNZ); sold to National Australia Bank in 1992
* Contact Energy – sold to cornerstone shareholder and sharemarket float in 1999
* DFC New Zealand Limited – went bankrupt in 1989 and later liquidated
* Export Guarantee Office

<doc id="320268" wikidata="Q470856" url="?curid=320268" title="Jan Pieterszoon Coen">
<text>Jan Pieterszoon Coen (; 8 January 1587 – 21 September 1629) was a Dutch naval officer of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the early 17th century, holding two terms as governor-general of the Dutch East Indies. He was the founder of Batavia, capital of the Dutch East Indies. Renowned for providing the impulse that set the VOC on the path to dominance in the Dutch East Indies, he was long considered a national hero in the Netherlands. Since the 19th century, his legacy has become controversial due to the brutal violence he employed in order to secure a trade monopoly on nutmeg, mace and clove. He led the final Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in 1621, which culminated in the Banda massacre, which saw 2,800 Bandanese killed and 1,700 enslaved by the Dutch. This is regarded as an act of genocide and earned him the nickname of &#x27;Butcher of Banda&#x27;.

A famed quote of his from 1618, &quot;Despair not, spare your enemies not, for God is with us&quot;, illustrates his single-minded ruthlessness, and his unstinting belief in the divinely-sanctioned nature of his project. Using such self-professed divine sanction to violently pursue his ultimate goal of trade monopoly in the East Indies, Dutch soldiers acting on Coen&#x27;s orders perpetrated numerous wanton acts of destruction in the spice islands of (now) eastern Indonesia, including the infamous Banda Massacre of 1621. The purpose of this was to gain a monopoly upon the supply of nutmeg and mace in order to sustain artificially high prices and profits for the Dutch investors of the VOC. This was deemed by many to be excessive, even for such a relatively violent age. Consequently, since the independence of Indonesia he has been looked at in a more critical light, and historians view his often violent methods to have been excessive.

== Life ==
Coen was born in Hoorn on 8 January 1587 to a strict Calvinist family. In 1601, he travelled to Rome, to study trade in the offices of the Fleming Joost de Visscher, where he learned the art of bookkeeping. Joining the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1606, he made a trading voyage to the East Indies in 1607 with the fleet of Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff.

=== First VOC voyage and return (1607–1612) ===
During the journey, Verhoeff and 42 of his men were killed during negotiations with the chiefs of the Banda Islands.

After his return to the republic in 1610, Coen submitted an important report on trade possibilities in Southeast Asia to the company&#x27;s directors. As a result of this report, he was again sent overseas in 1612, with the rank of chief merchant.

=== Second VOC voyage and promotion (1612–1617) ===
On the second trip, he acquitted himself so well of his commission and notable by the success of his practice of commerce, that in October 1613, he was appointed as accountant-general of all VOC offices in the East Indies and president of the head offices in Bantam and Jakarta.

In 1614, he was made director-general, second in command. On 25 October 1617, the Heren XVII of the VOC appointed him as the fourth governor-general in the East Indies, of which he was informed on 30 April 1618.

=== Conquest of Jayakarta and Banda (1618–1622) ===

As a merchant and Calvinist, Coen was convinced of the necessity of strict enforcement of contracts entered into with Asian rulers. He accordingly aided Indonesian princes against their indigenous rivals or against other European powers and was given commercial monopolies for the company in return. Thus the Dutch, at the price of heavy military and naval investment, slowly gained control of the area&#x27;s rich spice trade.

Between 1614 and 1618, Coen secured a clove monopoly in the Moluccas and a nutmeg monopoly in the Banda Islands. The inhabitants of Banda had been selling the spices to the English and other Indonesians tribes owing to their offering better prices, despite contracts with the Dutch, which obliged them to sell only to the VOC, at low prices.

In 1621, he led the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands, using Japanese mercenaries. After encountering some fierce resistance, mostly by cannons that the natives had acquired from the English, they took the island of Lonthor by force. 2,800 inhabitants were massacred and replaced by slave labor from other islands to make way for Dutch planters. Of the 15,000 inhabitants it is believed only about a thousand survived on the island. Eight hundred people were deported to Batavia.

Because of disputes at the head office in Bantam with natives, the Chinese, and the English, the VOC desired a better central headquarters. Coen thus directed more of the company&#x27;s trade through Jakarta, where it had established a factory in 1610. However, not trusting the native ruler, he decided in 1618 to convert the Dutch warehouses into a fort. While away on an expedition, the English took control of the town. Coen managed to reconquer Jakarta in 1619, with fire destroying most of the town during the process. He rebuilt the city and fort, thus founding the new Dutch town over the ruins of its predecessor, which he forthwith proclaimed the capital of the Dutch East Indies. In 1621, the city was renamed Batavia. Coen preferred Nieuw Hoorn, after his hometown, but did not get his way.

=== Return to the Netherlands (1622–1627) ===
In 1622, Coen revisited Europe. On 1 February 1623, he handed his post to Pieter de Carpentier and returned to the Netherlands, where he was given a hero&#x27;s welcome off the coast of Texel. He then became head of the VOC chamber in Hoorn and worked on establishing new policies. During his absence from the East Indies, difficulties with the English were exacerbated by Dutch massacre of 21 Englishmen on Amboyna. On 3 October 1624, he was reappointed governor-general in the East Indies, but his departure was hindered by the English. In 1625, he married Eva Ment, and in 1627 departed incognito for the East Indies with his wife, their newborn child and her brother and sister, starting work on 30 September 1627. After his arrival, the English abandoned Batavia and established their headquarters in Bantam.

=== Last years (1627–1629) ===
Twice during Coen&#x27;s term in office, Sultan Agung of Mataram besieged Batavia, in 1628 and 1629. Agung&#x27;s military was poorly armed and had inadequate provisions of food, and was never able to capture the city. During Agung&#x27;s second siege Coen suddenly died on 21September 1629, likely due to the cholera outbreak in Batavia during this siege.

In Imogiri, there is a persistent folklore that Coen&#x27;s remains were stolen from his grave in Jakarta, and placed under the steps leading up to Sultan Agung&#x27;s grave.

== Legacy ==
He was long considered a national hero in the Netherlands. Since the 19th century, his legacy has become controversial due to the violence he employed, especially during the last stage of the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands, which is widely considered a genocide.

Named for him are the Coentunnel and the Coenhaven in Amsterdam. There is also the Coen River in Queensland, Australia, named in 1653 by Jan Carstenszoon. There are a number of derived placenames including the town of Coen.

===Statues===

A statue to Coen was revealed in Batavia on 4 September 1876, in front of the Weltevreden Estate. It was destroyed by Japanese occupying forces on 7 March 1943.

Of the monuments that remember Coen in the Netherlands, the best-known is the in Hoorn, with the motto &quot;Dispereert niet&quot; (&quot;do not despair&quot;). Made in 1887 by Ferdinand Leenhoff in bronze, it was placed on a central location in Hoorn, the Roode Steen, in 1893. Following a citizen&#x27;s initiative, in 2012 the city council placed an additional text on the statue&#x27;s pedestal, explaining the controversial nature of Coen&#x27;s actions and legacy, and detailing some of his atrocities.

A statue for Coen in Amsterdam, on one of the corners of the Beurs van Berlage, also includes the &quot;Dispereert niet&quot; motto.

<text>Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis is a diurnal subspecies of &quot;Phelsuma sundbergi&quot;. It lives on the islands Ladigue, Felicite and Cocco in the Seychelles, and typically inhabits trees and dwellings. The Seychelles giant day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard is a large day gecko. It can reach a total length of about 16 cm. The body color is bright green or bluish green. A faint red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there are irregularly shaped reddish dots and bars present which can be quite variable in appearance. These geckos have yellow eye rings. The throat is yellow. The ventral side is yellowish white or yellow.

== Distribution ==
This species is found on the islands La Digue, Felicité and Cocco in the Seychelles.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Phelsuma sundbergi ladiguensis&quot; is often found on different large trees such coconut palms. This species also lives near or on human dwellings.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
While feeding, these geckos aid in the pollination of palm trees by transferring pollen between female and male trees.

== Reproduction ==
The females of this species are colony nesters and more than 50 eggs can be found at one location. At a temperature of 28 °C, the juveniles will hatch after approximately 56–71 days.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed singly or in pairs. Unpaired &quot;P. sundbergi ladiguensis&quot; are prone to fighting, sometimes causing significant injury or death if not quickly removed.

This is a skittish species that should not be handled and is prone to escape. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 65–75% during the day and slightly higher at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies. A commercial powered Crested Gecko diet (made by Repashy and mixed with water), supplemented with occasional insects, works well and supports breeding. This diet works well for most fruit/nectar-eating geckos.

<text>Occident was a French far-right militant group, active in France between 1964 and 1968 and considered the &quot;main activist group on the extreme right in the 1960s&quot;. Occident activists were known for their &quot;commando&quot; actions against various &quot;enemy&quot; targets, such as left-wing students, PCF offices, immigrant associations, and anti-colonialists. A number of former Occident members later became prominent figures in mainstream right-wing parties; some even obtained ministerial positions. The movement was banned by the French authorities in October 1968, following violent confrontations with left-wing groups during the May 1968 events.

== History ==
Occident was founded in April 1964 by Pierre Sidos and dissidents from the Parisian section of the Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN), following their defection from the white nationalist movement &quot;Europe-Action&quot; (1963–66), led by Dominique Venner. At the outset, Occident appeared as a remake of Jeune Nation, an older neo-fascist group Sidos had created back in 1949, and disbanded by the authorities in 1958. Occident similarly used the Celtic Cross as their emblem, and violent activism played a significant part in their political agenda.

On January 12, 1967, a group of Occident members attacked the Vietnam committees on the campus of the University of Rouen. About 20 members of Occident were arrested, including Gérard Longuet, Alain Madelin and Patrick Devedjian (all future right-wing ministers). Suspicions arose in the group that someone had tipped off the police. Patrick Devedjian, summoned for an alleged meeting, was brutally interrogated by fellow members, including waterboarding in a bathtub. Devedjian escaped in the nude.

In January 1968, Roger Holeindre (future vice-President of the National Front) founded the &quot;Front uni de soutien au Sud-Viêt-Nam&quot; (United Front in Support of South Vietnam) which supported the US war effort. Occident actively participated in this Front.

Following violent confrontations during the May 1968 turmoils, Occident was termed an illegal violent group and dissolved by the administration of Charles de Gaulle on 31 October 1968 by application of the 1936 law on combat groups and private militias.

== Views ==
The Vietnam War had replaced the Algerian War as the battleground of the far right against communist expansionism. Occident proclaimed itself &quot;a violent movement and proud of it&quot;, active to &quot;defend the West wherever it fights&quot;.

Building on a &quot;rudimentary fusion of nationalism, neo-fascism and social Darwinism&quot;, Occident was strongly anti-communist and anti-liberal. They called for the establishment of a corporatist economic regime and promoted the overthrow of &quot;the Masonic and plutocratic republic&quot;, through a &quot;second French Revolution that [would] sweep away the pernicious effects of the first&quot;. Occident advocated for a &quot;new race&quot; of leaders who would emerge from the &quot;nationalist ranks&quot;, not through the &quot;myth of election&quot; but via the &quot;selection of the best elements from the entire nation&quot;.

<text>The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) was the second largest (after LMS) of the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies created by the Railways Act 1921 in Britain. It operated from 1 January 1923 until nationalisation on 1 January 1948. At that time, it was divided into the new British Railways&#x27; Eastern Region, North Eastern Region, and partially the Scottish Region.

==History==

The company was the second largest created by the Railways Act 1921. The principal constituents of the LNER were:
* Great Eastern Railway
* Great Central Railway
* Great Northern Railway
* Great North of Scotland Railway
* Hull and Barnsley Railway
* North British Railway
* North Eastern Railway

The total route mileage was . The North Eastern Railway had the largest route mileage of , whilst the Hull and Barnsley Railway was . The company retained a decentralised management, with headquarters functions divided between York, Edinburgh and London. The office of the Chief General Manager was at King&#x27;s Cross station and the Chairman&#x27;s office was at Marylebone station.

It covered the area north and east of London. It included the East Coast Main Line from London to Edinburgh via York and Newcastle upon Tyne and the routes from Edinburgh to Aberdeen and Inverness. It also included the Great Central Main Line, from London Marylebone to Sheffield. Most of the country east of the Pennines was within its purview, including East Anglia. The main workshops were in Doncaster, with others at Darlington, Inverurie and Stratford, London.

The company also owned the most westerly track and stations in Great Britain, in the form of the West Highland Railway to Arisaig and Mallaig, previously owned by the North British Railway. 

The LNER inherited four of London&#x27;s termini: (ex-London and Blackwall Railway; King&#x27;s Cross (ex-Great Northern Railway); (ex-Great Eastern Railway); and (ex-Great Central Railway). In addition, it ran suburban services to (London, Midland and Scottish Railway) and (Metropolitan Railway, later London Transport).

The LNER owned:
* 7,700 locomotives, 20,000 coaching vehicles, 29,700 freight vehicles, 140 items of electric rolling stock, 6 electric locomotives and 10 rail motor cars
* 6 turbine and 36 other steamers, and river boats and lake steamers, etc.

In partnership with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the LNER was co-owner of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, the UK&#x27;s biggest joint railway, much of which competed with the LNER&#x27;s own lines. The M&amp;GNJR was incorporated into the LNER in 1936. In 1933, on the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board, the LNER acquired the remaining operations of the Metropolitan Railway Company.

The LNER was the majority partner in the Cheshire Lines Committee and the Forth Bridge Railway Company.

It depended on freight from heavy industry in Yorkshire, the north east of England and Scotland, and its revenue was reduced by the economic depression for much of the early part of its existence. In a bid to improve financial efficiency, staffing levels reduced from 207,500 in 1924 to 175,800 in 1937. For investment to retain freight traffic, new marshalling yards were built in Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, and Hull in Yorkshire to attempt to retain freight traffic.

Sir Ralph Wedgwood introduced a Traffic Apprenticeship Scheme to attract graduates, train young managers and provide supervision by assistant general manager Robert Bell for career planning. The company adopted a regional managerial system, with general managers based in London, York and Edinburgh, and for a short time, Aberdeen.

For passenger services, Sir Nigel Gresley, the Chief Mechanical Engineer built new powerful locomotives and new coaches. Later developments such as the streamlined Silver Jubilee train of 1935 were exploited by the LNER publicity department, and embedded the non-stop London to Edinburgh services such as the Flying Scotsman in the public imagination. The crowning glory of this time was the world record speed of achieved on a test run by LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard.

In 1929, the LNER chose the typeface Gill Sans as the standard typeface for the company. Soon it appeared on every facet of the company&#x27;s identity, from metal locomotive nameplates and hand-painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus, timetables and advertising posters. The LNER promoted their rebranding by offering Eric Gill a footplate ride on the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; express service; he also painted for it a signboard in the style of Gill Sans, which survives in the collection of the St Bride Library. Gill Sans was retained by the Railway Executive in 1948, although modified for signage, and Gill Sans was the official typeface until British Rail replaced it in the mid 1960s with Rail Alphabet for signs and Helvetica or Univers for printed matter.

Continental shipping services were provided from Harwich Parkeston Quay.

The company took up the offer in 1933 of government loans at low interest rates and electrified the lines from Manchester to Sheffield and Wath yard, and also commuter lines in the London suburban area.

==Ancillary activities==
The LNER inherited:
* 8 canals, including the Ashton, Chesterfield, Macclesfield, Nottingham &amp; Grantham and Peak Forest
* Docks and harbours in 20 locations, including Grimsby, Hartlepool, Hull, Immingham, Middlesbrough, some eastern Scottish ports, Harwich, Lowestoft and London
* Other wharves, staithes, piers
* 2 electric tramways
* 23 hotels (20 of them were nationalised in 1948 as British Transport Hotels. Of the other three, Cruden Bay Hotel was requisitioned in 1940, Palace Hotel, Aberdeen caught fire in 1941 and the Yarborough Hotel, New Holland was sold, being advertised for sale in 1947.)
* A 49% stake in the haulage firm Mutter, Howey &amp; Co. Ltd.

It took shares in a large number of bus companies, including for a time a majority stake in United Automobile Services Ltd. In Halifax and Sheffield, it participated in Joint Omnibus Committees with the LMS and the Corporation.

In 1935, with the LMS, Wilson Line of Hull and others it formed the shipping company Associated Humber Lines Ltd.

In 1938 it was reported that the LNER, with 800 mechanical horse tractors, was the world&#x27;s largest owner of this vehicle type.

===Ships===
The LNER operated a number of ships, including three rail ferries. In total, 6 turbine and 36 other steamers, and river boats and lake steamers were used by the company during its existence.

==Liveries==

The most common liveries were lined apple green on passenger locomotives (much lighter and brighter than the green used by the Great Western Railway) and unlined black on freight locomotives, both with gold lettering. Passenger carriages were generally varnished teak (wood) finish; the few metal-panelled coaches were painted to represent teak.

Some special trains and A4 Pacific locomotives were painted differently, including silver-grey and garter blue.

==Advertising==
The LNER covered quite an extensive area of Britain, from London through East Anglia, the East Midlands and Yorkshire to the north east of England and Scotland. The 1923 grouping meant that former rivals within the LNER had to work together. The task of creating an instantly recognisable public image went to William M. Teasdale, the first advertising manager. Teasdale was influenced by the philosophies and policies of Frank Pick, who controlled the style and content of the London Underground&#x27;s widely acclaimed poster advertising. Teasdale did not confine his artists within strict guidelines but allowed them a free hand. William Barribal designed a series of bold Art Deco posters in the 1920s and 1930s. When Teasdale was promoted to Assistant General Manager, this philosophy was carried on by Cecil Dandridge who succeeded him and was the Advertising Manager until nationalisation in 1948. Dandridge was largely responsible for the adoption of the Gill Sans typeface, later adopted by British Railways.

The LNER was a very industrial company: hauling more than a third of Britain&#x27;s coal, it derived two thirds of its income from freight. Despite this, the main image presented was one of glamour, of fast trains and sophisticated destinations. Advertising was highly sophisticated and advanced compared with those of its rivals. Teasdale and Dandridge commissioned top graphic designers and poster artists such as Tom Purvis to promote its services and encourage the public to visit the holiday destinations of the east coast in the summer.

==Chief office holders==
===Chairmen of the Board===
* William Whitelaw 1923 - 1938
* Sir Ronald Matthews 1938 - 1948

===Chief General Managers===
* Sir Ralph Wedgwood 1923 - 1939
* Charles Henry Newton 1939 - 1947
* Miles Beevor 1947 - 1948 (acting)

===Chief mechanical engineers===
* Sir Nigel Gresley was the first CME and held the post for most of the LNER&#x27;s existence, and thus he had the greatest effect on the company. He came to the LNER via the Great Northern Railway, where he was CME. He was noted for his &quot;Big Engine&quot; policy, and is best remembered for his large express passenger locomotives, many times the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives. LNER Class A4 4-6-2 Pacific locomotive &quot;Mallard&quot; holds the record to this day. Gresley died in office in 1941.
* Edward Thompson&#x27;s short reign (1941–1946) was a controversial one. A reputed detractor of Gresley even before his elevation to the post of CME, there are those who interpret many of his actions as being motivated by dislike of his predecessor. Thompson accepted that Gresley&#x27;s designs had their flaws as well as their brilliance but still included them as part of his future locomotive stud. His record is best served by his solid and dependable freight and mixed-traffic locomotives built under and for wartime conditions. He retired in 1946.
* Arthur Peppercorn&#x27;s career was cut short by nationalisation and he was CME for only 18 months. In this short period and in an atmosphere of reconstruction rather than great new endeavours, his only notable designs were the A1 and A2 Pacific express passenger locomotives, most completed after nationalisation. Peppercorn was a student and admirer of Gresley and his locomotives combined the classic lines of Gresley&#x27;s with the reliability and solidity they never quite achieved.

==Nationalisation==
The company was nationalised in 1948 along with the rest of the railway companies of Great Britain to form British Railways. It continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949.

On the privatisation of British Rail in 1996, the franchise to run long distance express trains on the East Coast Main Line was won by Sea Containers Ltd, who named the new operating company Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), a name and initials deliberately chosen to echo the LNER.

Following the collapse of Virgin Trains East Coast in May 2018, the newly-nationalised operator of the East Coast Main Line was named London North Eastern Railway to evoke the earlier company.

== Cultural activities ==
During the 1930s, the LNER Musical Society comprised a number of amateur male-voice choirs, based at Doncaster, Leicester, Huddersfield, Peterborough, Selby and elsewhere, which annually combined for a performance in London under their musical director Leslie Woodgate.

==Accidents==

* On 2 June 1944, WD Austerity 2-8-0 locomotive No. 7337 was hauling a freight train which caught fire as it approached , Cambridgeshire. The train comprised wagons carrying bombs. The train was divided behind the burning wagon, with the front portion being taken forward with the intention of isolating the wagon in open countryside. Its cargo detonated at Soham station, killing the fireman and the Soham signalman and injuring the trains&#x27; driver and guard. Soham station was severely damaged, but the line was re-opened within eighteen hours. For their actions, Benjamin Gimbert and James Nightall were awarded George Crosses.

<text>Groupe Union Défense (originally named &quot;Groupe Union Droit&quot;), better known as GUD, was a French far-right students&#x27; union formed in the 1960s. After a period of inactivity it relaunched in 2022.

The GUD was based in Panthéon-Assas University, a law school in Paris.

On 26 June 2024, the French government ordered the dissolution of the GUD.

== Ideology ==
Formed as far-right, anti-communist youth organization, in the mid-1980s, the GUD turned toward support of the Third Position movements and &quot;national revolutionary&quot; theories, as well as embracing anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism and support for Hafez al-Assad.

== Culture ==
GUD took as symbol the Celtic cross and the comic &quot;black rats&quot; (&quot;rats noirs&quot;).

Some music groups of Rock identitaire français had connections with GUD.

== History ==
GUD was founded in December 1968 under the name &quot;Union Droit&quot; at Panthéon-Assas University by , Gérard Longuet, Gérard Ecorcheville and some members of the political movement &quot;Occident&quot;. In its early period, it was a reactionary bourgeois student movement, and some of its early members went on to become mainstream conservative politicians, including Gérard Longuet, Hervé Novelli and Alain Madelin.

Members of the GUD participated in the 1969 founding of Ordre Nouveau.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, linked to the Parti des forces nouvelles (PFN), the GUD published the satiric monthly &quot;Alternative&quot;. Members in this period included Alain Orsoni, a Corsican nationalist linked to organised crime and suspected of the murder of Marie-Jeanne Bozzi.

On 9 May 1994 GUD member died after clashes between nationalists and riot police. Following these event, some French nationalist groups formed an umbrella organization &quot;Comité du 9-Mai&quot; (C9M) and holds yearly a commemorative marches in Paris on May 9.

In 1998, the Group united itself with &quot;Jeune Résistance&quot; and the &quot;Union des cercles résistance&quot;, offshoots of Nouvelle Résistance group, under the name Unité Radicale, but it was dissolved after Maxime Brunerie&#x27;s failed assassination attempt on president Jacques Chirac.

In 2004, the GUD reformed under the name . Its publication was &quot;Le Dissident&quot;. 

In 2017 members of the GUD squatted a building in Lyon and founded political movement Social Bastion.

In late 2022, graffiti appeared in educational institutions in Paris (including the École Normale Supérieure) saying &quot;GUD is back&quot;; a video was released on Ouest Casual, a Telegram channel used by the far right, commemorating some Greek neo-Nazis; and the GUD slogan “Europe, Youth, Revolution” appeared on stickers in Paris and chants at a right-wing demonstration in Lyon. Its activists were reported to be drawn from far-right trade union La Cocarde Étudiante, the ultra-right group the Zouaves, traditionalist Catholics from Versailles, and football hooligans.

== Members ==
Successive leaders of the GUD were: Alain Robert, Jack Marchal, Jean-François Santacroce, Serge Rep, Philippe Cuignache, Charles-Henri Varaut, Frédéric Chatillon, William Bonnefoy, Benoît Fleury.

=== Military volunteers ===
Some GUD members have fought in Lebanese Civil War with the Kataeb Party in 1976, Croatian War of Independence in the 1990s and in Burma during Karen conflict. In 1985 member of the GUD Jean-Philippe Courrèges was killed in action fighting for the Karen National Liberation Army.

GUD members have had links with the &quot;Department for Protection and Security&quot;, which is the security organization of the far-right political party National Front.

Former member of the GUD Alain Orsoni was member of the FLNC.

<text>Mahé day gecko (&quot;Phelsuma sundbergi longinsulae&quot;) is a diurnal subspecies of geckos. It lives on the western granite islands of the Seychelles and typically inhabits trees and human dwellings. The Seychelles giant day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard is a mid-size day gecko. It can reach a total length of about 15 cm. The body colour is bright green or bluish green. A red stripe extends from the nostril to the eye. On the back there are irregularly shaped reddish dots and bars present which form longitudinal rows. On the head there is a red v-shaped marking. These geckos have a yellow eye ring. The ventral side is yellowish white or yellow.

== Distribution ==
This species is found on the western granite islands of the Seychelles including the island Mahé.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Phelsuma sundbergi longinsulae&quot; is often found in coconut plantations, gardens, bushes and trees. This species often lives near or on human dwellings. This day gecko also shares its habitat with &quot;Phelsuma astriata astriata&quot;.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
While feeding, these geckos aid in the pollination of palm trees by transferring pollen between female and male trees. These geckos often live in small groups of one male and several females.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C during the day. The humidity should be maintained around 75–85% during the day and slightly higher at night. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>Union Nationale Interuniversitaire (UNI) or &quot;Inter-University Union&quot; is the largest French right union of university students, created in February 1969 to promote freedom of expression in reaction to the student crisis of May 68 and to support the political action of General de Gaulle.
==History==
The UNI was founded in order to expand the conservative and the right-wing influence in the French university after the May 1968 events. It was created under the initiative of the Service d&#x27;Action Civique, a secret service used by the right-wing gaullist movement, in particular by Robert Pandraud, Charles Pasqua and Jacques Foccart; the Service d&#x27;Action Civique was dissolved in 1982 by the socialist government.

The Inter-University Union has always been strongly anti-communist and anti-socialist opposing the numerous left-wing student groups that exist in the French universities. Since its foundation, the UNI claims to be a movement of activists, activism being the main mission of the organization along with the participation to the elections of the students&#x27; representatives within the French universities. The union also uses to position itself within the national political debate strongly opposing communism, affirmative action and cannabis legalization.

It received $575,000 between April 1984 and April 1985 from the government of the United States through the National Endowment for Democracy and was also supported by Irving Brown, leader of the international relations of the AFL–CIO and a CIA contractee.

Starting from 1995, UNI has supported president Jacques Chirac against the French Socialist Party. Its anti-socialist position pushed the &quot;UNI&quot; to get closer to the RPR and now to the UMP, the main French right-wing party. Some of its members also belong to the Movement for France, a more traditionalist conservative political party. &quot;UNI&quot; activists often participate to UMP rallies even though the two organizations do remain independent.

During the 2005 French European Constitution referendum, the union was strongly divided between eurosceptic and pro-European activists. The UNI leaders finally decided to support the European Constitution, while a big part of the union&#x27;s activists campaigned against it. This event pushed some members out of the union, leading to the creation of a new right-wing student union, more nationalist and traditionalist, the Rassemblement des Etudiants de Droite (Rally of the Right-wing Students). In the 2007 French Presidential election, the UNI has strongly supported the conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy even though some of its members preferred campaigning for the catholic traditionalist, eurosceptic and anti-immigration candidate, Philippe de Villiers.

== Famous former members of the UNI ==
* President Nicolas Sarkozy and Prime Minister François Fillon were both members of the UNI when they were studying at the university.
* Michèle Alliot-Marie, Jean-François Copé, Roger Karoutchi, Éric Raoult, Renaud Muselier, Laurent Wauquiez, Christian Jacob, Christian Vanneste, Bernard Debré, Jean-Paul Delevoye and Xavier Bertrand are also former members of the UNI.

<doc id="320283" wikidata="Q2799" url="?curid=320283" title="Delta encoding">
<text>Delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of &quot;differences&quot; (deltas) between sequential data rather than complete files; more generally this is known as data differencing. Delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression, particularly where archival histories of changes are required (e.g., in revision control software).

The differences are recorded in discrete files called &quot;deltas&quot; or &quot;diffs&quot;. In situations where differences are small – for example, the change of a few words in a large document or the change of a few records in a large table – delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy. Collections of unique deltas are substantially more space-efficient than their non-encoded equivalents.

From a logical point of view, the difference between two data values is the information required to obtain one value from the other – see relative entropy. The difference between identical values (under some equivalence) is often called &quot;0&quot; or the neutral element.

==Simple example==
Perhaps the simplest example is storing values of bytes as differences (deltas) between sequential values, rather than the values themselves. So, instead of 2, 4, 6, 9, 7, we would store 2, 2, 2, 3, −2. This reduces the variance (range) of the values when neighbor samples are correlated, enabling a lower bit usage for the same data. IFF 8SVX sound format applies this encoding to raw sound data before applying compression to it. Not even all 8-bit sound samples compress better when delta encoded, and the usability of delta encoding is even smaller for 16-bit and better samples. Therefore, compression algorithms often choose to delta encode only when the compression is better than without. However, in video compression, delta frames can considerably reduce frame size and are used in virtually every video compression codec.

==Definition==
A delta can be defined in 2 ways, &quot;symmetric delta&quot; and &quot;directed delta&quot;. A &quot;symmetric delta&quot; can be expressed as
: formula_1
where formula_2 and formula_3 represent two versions.

A &quot;directed delta&quot;, also called a change, is a sequence of (elementary) change operations which, when applied to one version formula_2, yields another version formula_3 (note the correspondence to transaction logs in databases). In computer implementations, they typically take the form of a language with two commands: &quot;copy data from v1&quot; and &quot;write literal data&quot;.

===Variants===
A variation of delta encoding which encodes differences between the prefixes or suffixes of strings is called incremental encoding. It is particularly effective for sorted lists with small differences between strings, such as a list of words from a dictionary.

==Implementation issues==
The nature of the data to be encoded influences the effectiveness of a particular compression algorithm.

Delta encoding performs best when data has small or constant variation; for an unsorted data set, there may be little to no compression possible with this method.

In delta encoded transmission over a network where only a single copy of the file is available at each end of the communication channel, special error control codes are used to detect which parts of the file have changed since its previous version.
For example, rsync uses a rolling checksum algorithm based on Mark Adler&#x27;s adler-32 checksum.

==Sample C code==
The following C code performs a simple form of delta encoding and decoding on a sequence of characters: 
void delta_encode(unsigned char *buffer, int length)
 unsigned char last = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
 unsigned char current = buffer[i];
 buffer[i] = current - last;
 last = current;
}

void delta_decode(unsigned char *buffer, int length)
 unsigned char last = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)
 unsigned char delta = buffer[i];
 buffer[i] = delta + last;
 last = buffer[i];
}

==Examples==
===Binary delta compression===
===Delta encoding in HTTP===
Another instance of use of delta encoding is RFC 3229, &quot;Delta encoding in HTTP&quot;, which proposes that HTTP servers should be able to send updated Web pages in the form of differences between versions (deltas), which should decrease Internet traffic, as most pages change slowly over time, rather than being completely rewritten repeatedly:

The suggested rsync-based framework was implemented in the &quot;rproxy&quot; system as a pair of HTTP proxies. Like the basic vcdiff-based implementation, both systems are rarely used.

=== Delta copying ===
&quot;Delta copying&quot; is a fast way of copying a file that is partially changed, when a previous version is present on the destination location. With delta copying, only the changed part of a file is copied. It is usually used in backup or file copying software, often to save bandwidth when copying between computers over a private network or the internet. One notable open-source example is rsync.

==== Online backup ====

Many of the online backup services adopt this methodology, often known simply as &quot;deltas&quot;, in order to give their users previous versions of the same file from previous backups. This reduces associated costs, not only in the amount of data that has to be stored as differing versions (as the whole of each changed version of a file has to be offered for users to access), but also those costs in the uploading (and sometimes the downloading) of each file that has been updated (by just the smaller delta having to be used, rather than the whole file).

==== Delta updates ====

For large software packages, there is usually little data changed between versions. Many vendors choose to use delta transfers to save time and bandwidth.

===Diff===

Diff is a file comparison program, which is mainly used for text files. By default, it generates symmetric deltas that are reversible. Two formats used for software patches, &quot;context&quot; and &quot;unified&quot;, provides additional context lines that allow for tolerating shifts in line number.

===Git===
The Git source code control system employs delta compression in an auxiliary &quot;git repack&quot; operation. Objects in the repository that have not yet been delta-compressed (&quot;loose objects&quot;) are compared against a heuristically chosen subset of all other objects, and the common data and differences are concatenated into a &quot;pack file&quot; which is then compressed using conventional methods. In common use cases, where source or data files are changed incrementally between commits, this can result in significant space savings. The repack operation is typically performed as part of the &quot; git gc&quot; process, which is triggered automatically when the numbers of loose objects or pack files exceed configured thresholds.

The format is documented in the pack-format page of the Git documentation. It implements a directed delta.

===VCDIFF===

One general format for directed delta encoding is VCDIFF, described in RFC 3284. Free software implementations include Xdelta and open-vcdiff.

===GDIFF===
Generic Diff Format (GDIFF) is another directed delta encoding format. It was submitted to W3C in 1997. In many cases, VCDIFF has better compression rate than GDIFF.

===bsdiff===
Bsdiff is a binary diff program using suffix sorting. For executables that contain many changes in pointer addresses, it performs better than VCDIFF-type &quot;copy and literal&quot; encodings. The intent is to find a way to generate a small diff without needing to parse assembly code (as in Google&#x27;s Courgette). Bsdiff achieves this by allowing &quot;copy&quot; matches with errors, which are then corrected using an extra &quot;add&quot; array of bytewise differences. Since this array is mostly either zero or repeated values for offset changes, it takes up little space after compression.

Bsdiff is useful for delta updates. Google uses bsdiff in Chromium and Android. The &quot;deltarpm&quot; feature of the RPM Package Manager is based on a heavily modified bsdiff that can use a hash table for matching. FreeBSD also uses bsdiff for updates.

Since the 4.3 release of bsdiff in 2005, various improvements or fixes have been produced for it. Google maintains multiple versions of the code for each of its products. FreeBSD takes many of Google&#x27;s compatible changes, mainly a vulnerability fix and a switch to the faster suffix-sorting routine. Debian has a series of performance tweaks to the program.

&quot;ddelta&quot; is a rewrite of bsdiff proposed for use in Debian&#x27;s delta updates. Among other efficiency improvements, it uses a sliding window to reduce memory and CPU cost.

<text>Unité Radicale was a French far-right political group close to the Third Position and National Bolshevism thesis. It was founded in June 1998 from the merger of Groupe Union Défense and Nouvelle Résistance/Jeune Résistance/Union des Cercles Résistance, issued from Nouvelle Résistance, and dissolved on August 6, 2002. The group was led by Christian Bouchet.

&quot;Unité Radicale&quot; promoted a racist, antisemitic and anti-american political agenda adopting Nazi imagery during activities.

The group worked with the Mouvement national républicain of Bruno Mégret and some members of Unité Radicale were members of the Conseil national of this party.

Contributors to their website included former Collaborationist Roland Gaucher, who participated to the 1972 foundation of the National Front, along with Le Pen.

At the beginning of 2002, Unité Radicale split. Christian Bouchet departed the movement with his friends, and the group was then led by Fabrice Robert and Guillaume Luyt who gave it a more racist and anti-Muslim outlook.

An &quot;Unité Radicale&quot; member, Maxime Brunerie, tried to assassinate president Jacques Chirac on Bastille Day in 2002. Although &quot;Unité Radicale&quot; contended that Maxime Brunerie was not even a bona fide member, the French government administratively disbanded the group.

Subsequently, some former members of &quot;Unité Radicale&quot; formed another group, &quot;Bloc Identitaire&quot;, while some other &quot;nationalist revolutionaries&quot; of &quot;Unité Radicale&quot; formed the study group &quot;Réseau Radical&quot; (2002–2006), close to Bouchet&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Résistances&quot;.

<text>Merchandization is a critical term coined by the anti-globalization movement to designate the process of changing the viewpoint of individuals or society towards an object, service, or substance. Things that were formerly thought of as &quot;simply being there&quot; are now being thought of as commodities for sale and corporate profit. This change in viewpoint is called the merchandization of an object.

For example, anti-globalization and anti-capitalism activists claim that in today&#x27;s society, many things, including health care, culture, and education, are becoming mere merchandise.

Marx discussed this &quot;fetishism of commodities&quot; in the nineteenth century.
In other words, something may have usefulness, but it has no value unless it can be exchanged in the marketplace for something else considered to have value. That value may come because it fills a need through consumption or is further exchanged. In this way, labor, time, and natural resources have come to serve the market instead of the other way around.

The slogan of ATTAC is &quot;the World is not Merchandise&quot; (&quot;le monde n&#x27;est pas une marchandise&quot;).

<doc id="320300" wikidata="Q8000984" url="?curid=320300" title="Wildcard DNS record">
<text>A wildcard DNS record is a record in a DNS zone that will match requests for non-existent domain names. A wildcard DNS record is specified by using a codice_1 as the leftmost label (part) of a domain name, e.g. codice_2. The exact rules for when a wildcard will match are specified in , but the rules are neither intuitive nor clearly specified. This has resulted in incompatible implementations and unexpected results when they are used.

==Definitions of DNS wildcards==
A wildcard DNS record in a zone file looks similar to this example:

This wildcard DNS record will cause DNS lookups on domain names ending in codice_3 that do not exist to have MX records synthesized for them. So, a lookup for the MX record for codice_4 would return an MX record pointing to codice_5.

Wildcards in the DNS are much more limited than other wildcard characters used in other computer systems. Wildcard DNS records have a single codice_1 (asterisk) as the leftmost DNS label, such as codice_2. Asterisks at other places in the domain will not work as a wildcard, so neither codice_8 nor codice_9 work as wildcard DNS records. Moreover, the wildcard is matched only when a domain does not exist, not just when there are no matching records of the type that has been queried for. Even the definition of &quot;does not exist&quot; as defined in the search algorithm of section 4.3.3 can result in the wildcard not matching cases that one might expect with other types of wildcards.

The original definition of how a DNS wildcard behaves is specified in sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, but only indirectly by certain steps in a search algorithm and as a result, the rules are neither intuitive nor clearly specified. As a result, 20 years later, , &quot;The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System&quot; was written to help clarify the rules.

To quote , &quot;A common mistake is thinking that a wildcard MX for a zone will apply to all hosts in the zone. A wildcard MX will apply only to names in the zone which aren&#x27;t listed in the DNS at all.&quot; That is, if there is a wildcard MX for codice_2, and an A record (but no MX record) for codice_11, the correct response (as per ) to an MX request for codice_11 is &quot;no error, but no data&quot;; this is in contrast to the possibly expected response of the MX record attached to codice_2.

==Example usages==
The following example is from section 2.2.1 and is useful in clarifying how wildcards work. 

Say there is a DNS zone with the following resource records:

A look at the domain names in a tree structure is helpful:

 example
 │ └─ sub
 ├─ host1
 │ └─ _tcp
 │ └─ _ssh
 ├─ host2
 │ └─ _tcp
 │ └─ _ssh
 └─ subdel

The following responses would be synthesized from one of the wildcards in the zone:

The following responses would not be synthesized from any of the wildcards in the zone:

The final example highlights one common misconception about wildcards. A wildcard &quot;blocks itself&quot; in the sense that a wildcard does not match its own subdomains. That is, codice_14 does not match all names in the codice_15 zone; it fails to match the names below codice_14. To cover names under codice_14, another wildcard domain name is needed—codice_18—which covers all but its own subdomains.

==In practice==
To quote from , many DNS implementations diverge, in different ways, from the original definition of wildcards. Some of the variations include:

* With djbdns, in addition to checking for wildcards at the current level, the server checks for wildcards in all enclosing superdomains, all of the way up to the root. In the examples listed above, the query for codice_19 for an MX record would match a wildcard despite the domain codice_20 existing.
* Microsoft&#x27;s DNS server (if configured to do so) and MaraDNS (by default) have wildcards also match all requests for empty resource record sets; i.e., domain names for which there are no records &quot;of the desired type&quot;. In the examples listed above, the query for codice_21 for an MX record would match codice_22, despite codice_21 explicitly existing with only a TXT Record.

=== Registrants ===
Wildcard domains are widely used by blogging websites that allow users to create sub-domains upon demand; e.g., sites such as WordPress or Blogspot. Another popular use is by Free Dynamic DNS websites that allow users to create a DNS name that changes to match their host IP as the IP address is changed periodically by their ISP&#x27;s DHCP server.

=== New TLDs ===
New gTLDs are prohibited from publishing wildcards (or using equivalent name server mechanisms) by specification 6 of the ICANN New gTLD Base Registry agreement. However, ICANN&#x27;s Name Collision Occurrence Management Framework (PDF), explicitly requires new gTLDs to publish (for at least 90 days) special MX, SRV, TXT, and 127.0.53.53 A record wildcards that warn of potential name collisions due to use of relative domain names with domain search paths.

=== Registries/ISPs ===
Several domain name registrars have, at various times, deployed wildcard records for the top-level domains to provide a platform for advertising, most notably VeriSign for .com and .net with its (now removed) Site Finder system. The .museum TLD also had a wildcard record which has now been removed. , top-level domains using a wildcard A record (other than 127.0.53.53) are .fm, .la, .ph, .pw, .vg and .ws. The internationalized TLDs .中国 ( or for &quot;China&quot;) and .გე ( for the Georgian letters for the Georgian country code &quot;GE&quot;) also have wildcard A records. The codice_24 wildcard resolves to codice_25 (flagged by Chrome as unsafe), and the codice_26 wildcard resolves to a website of the .ge TLD.

It has also become common for ISPs to synthesize address records for typos, for the same person, a practice called &quot;catchall&quot; typosquatting, but these aren&#x27;t true wildcards, but rather modified caching name servers.

===Ignoring wildcards from others===
The Internet Software Consortium produced a version of the BIND DNS software that can be configured to filter out wildcard DNS records from specific domains. Various developers have produced software patches for BIND and for djbdns.

Other DNS server programs have followed suit, providing the ability to ignore wildcard DNS records as configured.

<text>Nightfall in Middle-Earth is the sixth studio album by the German power metal band Blind Guardian. It was released on 28 April 1998 through Virgin Records. It is a concept album based on J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, a book of tales from the First Age of Middle-earth, recounting the troubled history of Beleriand as the Elves battle with the Dark Lord Morgoth. The album contains not only songs but also spoken parts narrating parts of the story. The cover depicts a scene from &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, the elf Lúthien dancing in front of the Dark Lord Morgoth.

&quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot; is widely regarded as one of Blind Guardian&#x27;s best-known and best-received albums in their discography. It is also the first album with Oliver Holzwarth as guest musician, playing bass guitar instead of Hansi Kürsch.

It was the first album by Blind Guardian to be released in the United States. The sales encouraged Century Media to release their entire back catalog in the US in 2007, at which point it was remastered and re-released, with a bonus track.

== Musical style ==

The album has been described as &quot;grandiose&quot; and influenced by progressive rock. It has been compared to Queen&#x27;s operatic approach with &quot;dense choir-like vocal harmonies set against swirling multi-part guitar lines.&quot; Music critics have noted the fast, melodic guitar-work and the use of folk instruments, flutes, violins, and other instruments. The album&#x27;s songs are varied, with &quot;quick-paced numbers&quot;, ballads, and operatic pieces. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; described it as &quot;a banquet of medieval/folk, speed/power metal, and Queen-esque vocal twists, complete with interludes to illustrate the plot.&quot;

== Thematic references ==

The album retells the events in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, beginning with an episode at the end:

# In &quot;War of Wrath&quot;, Sauron advises his master Morgoth to flee the triumphant Valar in the War of Wrath. Morgoth sends him away and reflects on the events leading up to his defeat.
# In &quot;Into the Storm&quot;, Morgoth and Ungoliant, fleeing from Valinor after having destroyed the Two Trees, struggle for the possession of the Silmarils.
# &quot;Lammoth&quot; is Morgoth&#x27;s scream of fear. It summons his Balrogs to his aid to fight off Ungoliant.
# In &quot;Nightfall&quot;, Fëanor and his seven sons mourn the destruction wrought by Morgoth, including the slaying of Finwë, Fëanor&#x27;s father, and swear to get revenge on him, in spite of the Valar&#x27;s disapproval.
# &quot;The Minstrel&quot; is most likely about Maglor, son of Fëanor, who composed the song &quot;The Fall of the Noldor&quot; based on the Kinslaying.
# In &quot;The Curse of Fëanor&quot;, Fëanor expresses his wrath and anger and relates the misdeeds he commits, especially the Kinslaying, in pursuit of Morgoth.
# In &quot;Captured&quot;, Morgoth addresses the captive Maedhros, Fëanor&#x27;s son, and chains him to the Thangorodrim mountains.
# In &quot;Blood Tears&quot;, Maedhros relates the horrors of his captivity and his deliverance by Fingon.
# &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot; recounts how Turgon, in view of inevitable defeat, builds the city of Gondolin, aided by Ulmo (&quot;The Lord of Water&quot;).
# In &quot;Face the Truth&quot;, Fingolfin reflects about the destiny of the Noldor.
# In &quot;Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns)&quot;, Fingolfin recounts his Noldor army&#x27;s passage from the icy waste of Helcaraxë and the prophecy by Mandos about the Noldor&#x27;s fate; he reflects on his own and his people&#x27;s guilt and foreshadows their ultimate defeat.
# &quot;The Battle of Sudden Flame&quot; refers to the battle in which Morgoth breaks the Siege of Angband using his Balrogs and dragons. The lyrics tell of how Barahir of the House of Bëor, with great loss to his own company, saved the life of the Elven king Finrod Felagund, and in return Finrod swore an oath of friendship to Barahir and all of his kin.
# &quot;Time Stands Still (at the Iron Hill)&quot; is about Fingolfin riding to the gates of Angband to challenge Morgoth to a duel. Fingolfin wounds Morgoth seven times but is eventually killed.
# &quot;The Dark Elf&quot; refers to Eöl who seduced Turgon&#x27;s sister and fathered Maeglin, who would eventually betray Gondolin.
# &quot;Thorn&quot; is a song describing Maeglin&#x27;s captivity in Angband and Morgoth trying to convert Maeglin to his side with threats and lies. The title of the song refers to the thorn bushes that hid the outer gates of Gondolin.
# &quot;The Eldar&quot; is Elven king Finrod Felagund&#x27;s farewell to his people, dying from wounds sustained by saving his human friend Beren from a werewolf, thereby fulfilling his oath to the House of Bëor.
# In &quot;Nom the Wise&quot;, Beren mourns his friend Finrod. &quot;Nóm&quot; means &quot;wise&quot; and was the name given to Finrod by Beren&#x27;s forefather Bëor.
# In &quot;When Sorrow Sang&quot;, Beren sings about his love to the Elven princess Lúthien and his death at the teeth of Morgoth&#x27;s wolf Carcharoth. Last part is about Mandos listening to Luthien&#x27;s song about their grief experienced by being different in kin.
# &quot;Out on the Water&quot; refers to the last dwelling-place of Beren and Lúthien.
# In &quot;The Steadfast&quot;, Morgoth curses his captive Húrin (known in Elvish as the Steadfast) who refused to reveal the secret of Gondolin.
# In &quot;A Dark Passage&quot;, Morgoth ponders his triumph in the fifth battle. The song also relates the origins of the kindred of men and Morgoth&#x27;s curse on Húrin to be witness to his children&#x27;s tragic fate.
# &quot;Final Chapter (Thus Ends ...)&quot; concludes the album, speaking of Morgoth&#x27;s victory by the &quot;treachery of man&quot; but also of the hope for a new day.
# &quot;Harvest of Sorrow&quot; is a bonus track on the 2007 and 2018 remastered versions of the album. Túrin mourns the loss of his sister Niënor.
# &quot;Doom&quot; is a bonus track on the 2018 remastered version of the album. The track shows a more detailed account of Húrin being cursed by Morgoth. A slightly rewritten version appears on a limited edition of &quot;Beyond the Red Mirror&quot; as an epilogue chapter.
# &quot;The Tides of War&quot; is a bonus track on the 2018 remastered version of the album. The track tells of the rebellious Noldor arriving in Beleriand to face Morgoth, thinking also about the burning of the Teleri ships at Losgar and the Oath of Fëanor.

The cover art for the album features Lúthien dancing before Morgoth, from &quot;The Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot;.

== Reception ==

The album has drawn universally positive critical acclaim since its release. Writing for Sputnikmusic, Kyle Ward said that on this album &quot;Blind Guardian laid down their finest instrumental performance to date. Everything goes hand in hand with each other, the guitars being nearly always furiously paced and extremely melodic, but not over-the-top and cheesy like many other power metal bands out there.&quot; He singled out Hansi Kürsch&#x27;s vocals for particular praise, writing that &quot;In every aspect and mood, Blind Guardian delivers in the vocal department. Whether the song is amazingly fast and melodic, like &quot;Time Stands Still (at the Iron Hill)&quot; or whether the mood is somber and slow (&quot;The Eldar&quot;) you are sure to be hit in the face with a simply remarkable feat in terms of vocal achievement, one of the finest vocal performances I have ever seen on a metal album.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Vincent Jeffries gave a similarly glowing assessment of the album, describing the album as &quot;complete with anthemic choruses, spoken word story lines, and plenty of bombastic power metal punctuating every dramatic turn&quot; and &quot;perhaps Blind Guardian&#x27;s most triumphant effort.&quot;

In a volume edited by Tolkien scholar Bradford Lee Eden, Amy H. Sturgis writes that &quot;although one can assume that Tolkien was not a headbanger&quot;, she finds that in the opinion of her students, the &quot;driving energy&quot; of the power metal sound is appropriate for the stories: &quot;The music conveys rage and despair, which fits lyrics such as &#x27;The doom of the Noldor drew near/ The words of a banished king, “I swear revenge!”&#x27;&quot; Sturgis adds that this facilitates discussion of Tolkien&#x27;s Christian view of the fall of man.

&quot;Metal Hammer&quot; named it in its lists &quot;The 10 Essential Symphonic Metal Albums&quot; and in &quot;The 10 Essential Power Metal Albums&quot;. &quot;ThoughtCo&quot; named it one of the essential power metal albums.

Grimdark Magazine&#x27;s C.T. Phipps called it one of his &quot;favorite power metal band&#x27;s greatest works&quot;. He states that it is told from the point of view of the Dark Lord Morgoth, with the story told both in the songs and in &quot;little vignettes&quot; in between. He describes the music as &quot;not just your traditional power metal sound but there’s quite a bit of melodious, folksy Medieval sounding tunes spread between the fast guitar work.&quot;

<doc id="320308" wikidata="Q3344088" url="?curid=320308" title="North American Network Operators' Group">
<text>The North American Network Operators&#x27; Group (NANOG) is a forum for the coordination and dissemination of information to backbone/enterprise networking technologies and operational practices. It runs meetings, talks, surveys, and a mailing list for Internet service providers. The main method of communication is the NANOG mailing list (known informally as NANOG-l), a free mailing list to which anyone may subscribe or post.

== History ==
NANOG evolved from the NSFNET &quot;Regional-Techs&quot; meetings, where technical staff from the regional networks met to discuss operational issues. At the February 1994 regional tech meeting in San Diego, the group revised its charter to include a broader base of network service providers and subsequently adopted NANOG as its new name. NANOG was organized by Merit Network, a non-profit Michigan organization, from 1994 through 2011, when it was transferred to NewNOG.

=== Funding ===
Funding for NANOG originally came from the National Science Foundation as part of two projects Merit undertook in partnership with NSF and other organizations: the NSFNET Backbone Service and the Routing Arbiter project. All NANOG funds came from conference registration fees and donations from vendors, and starting in 2011, membership dues.

== Meetings ==
NANOG meetings are held three times each year and include presentations, tutorials, and BOFs (Birds of a Feather meetings). There are also lightning talks, where speakers can submit brief presentations (no longer than 10 minutes) on a very short term. Conference participants typically include senior engineering staff from tier 1 and tier 2 ISPs. In addition to the conferences, NANOG On the Road events offer single-day networking events.

NANOG meetings are organized by NewNOG, Inc., a Delaware non-profit organization, which took over responsibility for NANOG from the Merit Network in February 2011. Meetings are hosted by NewNOG and other organizations from the U.S. and Canada. Overall leadership is provided by the NANOG Steering Committee, established in 2005, and a Program Committee.

<text>Roland Gaucher (; 13 April 1919 – 27 July 2007) was the pseudonym of Roland Goguillot, a French far-right journalist and politician. One of the main thinkers of the French far-right, he had participated in Marcel Déat&#x27;s fascist party Rassemblement National Populaire (RNP) under the Vichy regime. Sentenced to five years of prison for Collaborationism after the war, he then engaged in a career of journalism, while continuing political activism. One of the co-founders of the National Front (FN) in October 1972, he became a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the FN in 1986.

==Early career==
Roland Gaucher entered politics as a far-left activist, first as a member of the Trotskyist group &quot;Fédération des étudiants révolutionnaires&quot; (Federation of Revolutionary Students) and then of the &quot;Jeunesses socialistes ouvrières&quot; (Workers&#x27; Socialist Youth), where he met with Robert Hersant and Alexandre Hébert, who would become one of the leaders of the social-democrat trade-union &quot;Force Ouvrière&quot; (FO).

However, Gaucher shifted to the far right during World War II, joining Marcel Déat&#x27;s &quot;Rassemblement National Populaire&quot; (RNP) Fascist party in March 1942. He was responsible for the RNP&#x27;s youth organisation, and for its Parisian section from May to November 1943. He criticized the Vichy regime for being too &quot;moderate&quot; and not executing enough people. At the time of France&#x27;s Liberation, he was in charge of deleting the archives of the &quot;National Populaire&quot; &#x27;s readers, which was the mouthpiece of the RNP. At the end of 1944, according to Marcel Déat&#x27;s diary, he fled with Marshal Philippe Pétain&#x27;s men to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany.

==Post-war (1945–1980s)==
Gaucher was sentenced to five years of prison for Collaborationism after the war. After that, he took up a career in journalism, working in Robert Hersant&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Journal&quot; (Hersant had also been condemned for Collaborationism ), &quot;Les Ecrits de Paris&quot;, &quot;Est et Ouest&quot; and then as a reporter (&quot;grand reporter&quot;) for the far-right newspaper &quot;Minute&quot; from 1965 to 1984.

In the meantime, he joined Georges Albertini&#x27;s anti-Communist networks through the BEPI and &quot;Est and Ouest&quot;. He participated in Pierre Poujade&#x27;s movement. In the middle of the 1950s, he joined Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour&#x27;s &quot;Rassemblement national&quot;, becoming its secretary general. From 1959 to 1960 he was an employee of the ANFAN (&quot;Association National des Français d&#x27;Afrique du Nord&quot;, National Association of Frenchmen from North Africa), and in 1961 secretary of the AEIPI.

He was one of the co-founders of the National Front (FN) in October 1972, becoming a member of its directing committee. But Gaucher then participated in the split in 1974 leading to the creation of the &quot;Parti des forces nouvelles&quot; (PFN), gathering radical activists who considered Jean-Marie Le Pen to be too &quot;moderate.&quot; There, he contributed to the magazine &quot;Initiative nationale&quot;. Gaucher was a member of the central committee of the PFN in 1974, and then of the political bureau in 1976. He was the PFN&#x27;s representative during the Eurodroite meeting in Paris on 28 June 1978, which gathered the Italian MSI, the Spanish &quot;Fuerza Nueva&quot; and the Belgian &quot;Forces Nouvelles&quot; along with the PFN for the 1979 European elections. In 1979, he quit the PFN along with François Brigneau to rejoin the FN, at the request of Jean-Pierre Stirbois.

==Career in the FN (1980s–1990s)==
Roland Gaucher entered the European Parliament in 1986 under the banner of the FN, replacing Dominique Chaboche, and was vice-president of the European delegation for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He was also elected as regional counsellor of the Picardy region (1986–1987) and then of the Franche-Comté (1992–1998). He remained an active member of the FN from 1981 to 1993. He successfully sued &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Est Républicain&quot; for defamation in 1992, which accused him of being a former Waffen-SS.

He founded in 1984 the FN&#x27;s weekly &quot;National-Hebdo&quot;, of which he was chief editor until 1993. He also directed &quot;Le Crapouillot&quot;, which he owned, from 1991 to 1994.

In 1993, he took his distances with Le Pen&#x27;s FN, charging it of being too institutional. Revelations by the press on his past also had a role in this decision. Although he stop paying his membership to the FN in August 1994, he remained &quot;apparenté FN&quot; in the Franche-Comté regional council. He got closer at this time to other far-right structures, such as the &quot;Militant&quot;, led by his friend Jean Castrillo, and Jean-François Touzé&#x27;s &quot;Alliance Populaire&quot; (Popular Alliance). He also collaborated articles to the &quot;Unité Radicale&quot; &#x27;s website in 2001–2002, a party close to the Third Position&#x27;s ideas, and took part to one of its meetings on 22 September 2001. He also wrote a few articles for Christian Bouchet, leader of Unité Radicale, until 2005 and also for Philippe Randa.

Gaucher also signed the call for &quot;national reconciliation&quot; between the FN and Bruno Mégret&#x27;s National Republican Movement (MNR) in 2001.

Gaucher, who had once declared in one of his books being a member of the National Populist tendency of the FN, maintained links as much with the Lefebvrist Catholics as he did with the &quot;Nationalist Revolutionaries&quot;. He was also for a time a member of the patronage committee of Alain de Benoist&#x27;s GRECE.

<text>The Élysée Palace (, ) is the official residence of the President of the French Republic in Paris. Completed in 1722, it was built for Louis Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, a nobleman and army officer who had been appointed Governor of Île-de-France in 1719. It is located on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in the 8th arrondissement, near the Champs-Élysées. The name Élysée derives from the Elysian Fields, the place of the blessed dead in Greek mythology.

The Élysée Palace has been the home of personalities such as Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), Nicolas Beaujon (1718–1786), Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans (1750–1822), Joachim Murat (1767–1815), and Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry (1778–1820). On 12 December 1848, under the Second Republic, the French Parliament passed a law declaring the building the official residence of the French president. The Élysée Palace, which contains the presidential office and residency, is also the meeting place of the Council of Ministers, the weekly meeting of the Government of France that is presided over by the President of the Republic. Across the street is the Hôtel de Marigny, which has served as a state guest house where the French government has hosted visiting dignitaries.

==History==
===Hôtel d&#x27;Évreux===
The architect Armand-Claude Mollet possessed a property fronting on the road to the village of Roule, west of Paris (now the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré), and backing onto royal property, the &quot;Grand Cours&quot; through the Champs-Élysées. He sold this in 1718 to Louis Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Count of Évreux, with the agreement that Mollet would construct an for the count, fronted by an entrance court and backed by a garden. The Hôtel d&#x27;Évreux was finished and decorated by 1722, and though it has undergone many modifications since, it remains a fine example of the French neo-classical style. At the time of his death in 1753, Évreux was the owner of one of the most widely admired houses in Paris, and it was bought by the Marquise de Pompadour on 24 December 1753 for 730,000 livres. Opponents showed their distaste for the regime by hanging signs on the gates that read: &quot;Home of the King&#x27;s whore&quot;. After her death, it was left in her will to the crown.

In 1773, it was purchased by Nicolas Beaujon, banker to the court and one of the richest men in France, who needed a suitably sumptuous &quot;country house&quot; (for the city of Paris did not yet extend this far) to house his fabulous collection of great masters paintings. To this end, he hired the architect Étienne-Louis Boullée to make substantial alterations to the buildings (as well as design an English-style garden). Soon on display there were such well-known masterpieces as Holbein&#x27;s &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (now in the National Gallery in London), and Frans Hals&#x27; &quot;Bohemian&quot; (now at the Louvre). His architectural alterations and art galleries gave this residence international renown as &quot;one of the premier houses of Paris&quot;.

===Royal and imperial palace===
The palace and gardens were purchased from Beaujon by Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Bourbon in 1787 for 1,300,000 &quot;livres&quot;. It was the Duchess who named it the &quot;Élysée&quot;. She also built a group of cottages in the gardens which she named the Hameau de Chantilly, after the Hameau at her father-in-law&#x27;s Château de Chantilly. With the French Revolution, the Duchess fled the country and the Élysée was confiscated and leased out. The gardens were used for eating, drinking, and dancing, under the name Hameau de Chantilly, and the rooms became gambling houses.

The Élysée was sold in 1805 to Joachim and Caroline Murat, who administered major renovations that made the building more grand and &quot;imperial&quot;. Later, the house was transferred to Caroline&#x27;s brother, Emperor Napoleon, in 1808; it became known as the Élysée-Napoléon. After the Battle of Waterloo, Napoléon returned to the Élysée and signed his abdication there on 22 June 1815. He left the Élysée three days later.

Russian Cossacks camped at the Élysée when they occupied Paris in 1814. The property was then returned to its previous owner, the Duchesse de Bourbon, who then sold it to her royal cousin, Louis XVIII, in 1816. Between 1820 and 1848, the palace was primarily used to host guests of the royal family.

===Presidential residence===

Following the French Revolution of 1848 and the abdication of Louis Philippe I, the provisional government of the Second Republic took over the palace. It was initially used to host musical performances and lectures before being renamed the Élysée National and designated as the official residence of the President of the Republic under the administration of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. The President also has the use of other official residences, including the Château de Rambouillet, forty-five kilometres southwest of Paris, as well as the Fort de Brégançon near Toulon.

In 1853, following his coup d&#x27;état that ended the Second Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, now Napoleon III, tasked architect with renovations; meanwhile he moved to the nearby Tuileries Palace, but kept the Élysée as a discreet place to meet his mistresses, moving between the two palaces through a secret underground passage that has since been demolished. Since Lacroix completed his work in 1867, the essential look of the Palais de l&#x27;Élysée has remained the same.

In 1873, under the Third Republic, the Élysée became the official presidential residence. In 1899, Félix Faure became the only officeholder to die in the palace.
In 1917, a chimpanzee escaped from a nearby &quot;ménagerie&quot;, entered the palace and was said to have tried to haul the wife of President Raymond Poincaré into a tree only to be foiled by Élysée guards. President Paul Deschanel, who resigned in 1920 because of mental illness, was said to have been so impressed by the chimpanzee&#x27;s feat that, to the alarm of his guests, he took to jumping into trees during state receptions.

The Élysée Palace was closed in June 1940 and remained empty during World War II. It was reoccupied only in 1946 by Vincent Auriol, President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, then first President of the Fourth Republic from 1947 to 1954. From 1959 to 1969, the Élysée was occupied by Charles de Gaulle, the first President of the Fifth Republic. De Gaulle did not like its lack of privacy and oversaw the purchase of the luxurious Hôtel de Marigny to lodge foreign state officials in visits to France, saying, &quot;I do not like the idea of meeting Kings walking around my corridors in their pyjamas.&quot;

In the 1970s, President Georges Pompidou had some of the original rooms in the palace redesigned by Pierre Paulin in the modern style, of which only the Salle à Manger Paulin survives.

Socialist President François Mitterrand, who governed from 1981 to 1995, is said to have seldom used its private apartments, preferring the privacy of his own home on the more bohemian Rive Gauche. A discreet flat in the nearby presidential annexe Palais de l&#x27;Alma housed his mistress Anne Pingeot, mother of his illegitimate daughter Mazarine Pingeot.

By contrast, his successor Jacques Chirac lived throughout his two terms in office (1995–2007) in the Élysée apartments with his wife Bernadette. Chirac increased the Palace&#x27;s budget by 105% to 90 million euros per year, according to the book &quot;L&#x27;argent caché de l&#x27;Élysée&quot;. One million euros per year is spent on drinks alone for the guests invited to the Élysée Palace, 6.9 million euros per year on bonuses for presidential staff and 6.1 million euros per year on the 145 extra employees Chirac hired after he was elected in 1995.

The Élysée has gardens, in which presidents hosted parties on the afternoon of Bastille Day until 2010. That year, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to stop organising this event because of France&#x27;s high debt and the economic crisis.

Emmanuel Macron, the President of France since 2017, currently resides at the palace.

==Description==
The heavily guarded mansion and grounds are situated at 55 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré at its intersection with . A monumental gate with four Ionic order columns, flanked by walls topped by a balustrade, opens onto a large rounded courtyard. The majestic ceremonial courtyard imparts a degree of grandeur to the house. The main residence is constructed in the French neo-classical style. An entrance vestibule is aligned with the ceremonial courtyard and gardens. There is a long central building, a great – or state – apartment divided in the middle by a large salon that opens into the garden. This building also has a central three-storey section, and two single-floor wings: the Appartement des Bains to the right, and the Petit Appartement (private apartments) to the left. The French-style garden has a central path aligned with the central building, patterned flowerbeds and alleys of chestnut trees edged with hedgerows.

=== Ground floor ===
The Vestibule d&#x27;Honneur (Hall of Honour) is the room which the main entrance to the palace leads into. In this room the President of France meets visiting officials, world leaders and spiritual leaders.

The Salon d&#x27;Argent (Silver Room), in the east wing of the palace, was decorated by Caroline Murat, wife of Joachim Murat and sister of Napoleon I. The room is so called because of the silver coloured edges to the wall features, mantelpieces, tables, sofas, and armchairs, of which the last have swan sculptures at the sides. Three notable historical events happened in this room. On 22 June 1815, Napoleon formally signed his abdication warrant after losing the Battle of Waterloo that year; on 2 December 1851 Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte launched his coup d&#x27;état; and in 1899, President Félix Faure met his mistress, Marguerite Steinheil.

The Salle à Manger Paulin (Paulin Dining Room), named after its architect, Pierre Paulin, is a complete contrast to most of the other rooms in the palace. It was designed as a private dining room for President Georges Pompidou and his wife Claude, and the interior and furniture date from the 1970s. The walls are made of 22 polyester panels, the chairs have a single leg attached to a round base, and the round table is made of glass. The room is lit by roof panels decorated with glass balls and rods.

The Salon des Portraits (Portrait Room) was used by the Emperor Napoleon III for portrait medallions of the most important sovereigns of the time, replacing earlier portraits of the Bonaparte family installed by Joachim Murat. The portraits are of: Pope Pius IX, Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria-Hungary, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, Queen Isabel II of Spain, and King William I of Württemberg. Previously a dining room, President Nicolas Sarkozy used the room as his second office.

The Salle des Fêtes (Hall of Festivities) dominates the west wing of the palace. It was designed by and opened on 10 May 1889 by the then President, Sadi Carnot, to coincide with the Exposition Universelle that year. The room has paintings on the ceiling called &quot;La République sauvegarde la Paix&quot; (The Republic Safeguards Peace), painted by Guillaume Dubufe in 1894. There are also six Gobelins tapestries in the room, which is predominantly laid out in red and gold decor. In 1984 President François Mitterrand added ten windows to the room to let in more light. It is in this room that all French Presidents are inaugurated, and where they host official conferences and banquets.

The Jardins d&#x27;Hiver (Winter Gardens) was built in 1883 as a greenhouse for growing plants. Today it is no longer used for this purpose, being instead an extension of the Salon des Fêtes, and used for official banquets. There is a Gobelins tapestry on the wall, and three chandeliers hang from the ceiling.

The Salon Murat (Murat Room) is used every Wednesday by the President for meetings with the Prime Minister and the rest of the Government of France, along with the presidential secretary, known as the &quot;Secretary-General of the Élysée&quot;. It was also in this room that Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of Germany, signed the Élysée Treaty in 1963.

The Salon Cléopâtre (Cleopatra Room) gets its name from a Gobelins tapestry on the wall, installed during the presidency of Sadi Carnot, which depicts Antony and Cleopatra meeting at Tarsus. Also in the room is a portrait of Maria Amalia, Duchess of Parma, painted by Alexandre Roslin.

The Salon des Ambassadeurs (Ambassadors&#x27; Room) is where the French President officially receives ambassadors from abroad.

The Salon Bleu (Blue Room) is used as the office of the First Lady of France.

The Escalier Murat (Murat Staircase) is the main staircase in the palace, linking the ground and first floors.

===First floor===
The Salon Doré (Golden Room) is named after the gold coloured edges to the wall features, doors, tables, and chairs. All the French Presidents have used this room as their main study except Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Emmanuel Macron.

The Salon Vert (Green Room) is named after the green curtains and chair covers (the doors, chairs, tables, and wall features have gold edges). The room is used for reunions, and it was here that Nicolas Sarkozy married his second wife, Carla Bruni, during his presidency.

The Salon Angle (Angle Room) is a former dining room that has been the office of the Secretary-General of the Élysée since 2007.

The Salon de Fougères (Flower Room) is named because it has floral patterned wallpaper. In the room is a portrait of King Louis XV, painted by Charles-André van Loo.

The Ancienne Chambre de la Reine and the Ancienne Chambre du Roi were the bedrooms of the former Kings and Queens of France. The latter room was formerly used as the office of the Secretary-General before he moved it to the Salon Angle.

Six other rooms on the first floor, in the east wing, are the President&#x27;s private living quarters.

<doc id="320319" wikidata="Q4119391" url="?curid=320319" title="How to Solve It">
<text>How to Solve It (1945) is a small volume by mathematician George Pólya, describing methods of problem solving. 

This book has remained in print continually since 1945.

== Four principles ==
&quot;How to Solve It&quot; suggests the following steps when solving a mathematical problem:
# First, you have to &quot;understand the problem&quot;.
# After understanding, &quot;make a plan&quot;.
# &quot;Carry out the plan&quot;.
# &quot;Look back&quot; on your work. How could it be better?

If this technique fails, Pólya advises: &quot;If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?&quot;

=== First principle: Understand the problem ===

&quot;Understand the problem&quot; is often neglected as being obvious and is not even mentioned in many mathematics classes. Yet students are often stymied in their efforts to solve it, simply because they don&#x27;t understand it fully, or even in part. In order to remedy this oversight, Pólya taught teachers how to prompt each student with appropriate questions, depending on the situation, such as:

* What are you asked to find or show?
* Can you restate the problem in your own words?
* Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the problem?
* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
* Do you need to ask a question to get the answer?

The teacher is to select the question with the appropriate level of difficulty for each student to ascertain if each student understands at their own level, moving up or down the list to prompt each student, until each one can respond with something constructive.

=== Second principle: Devise a plan ===

Pólya mentions that there are many reasonable ways to solve problems. The skill at choosing an appropriate strategy is best learned by solving many problems. You will find choosing a strategy increasingly easy. A partial list of strategies is included:

* Guess and check
* Make an orderly list
* Eliminate possibilities
* Use symmetry
* Consider special cases
* Use direct reasoning
* Solve an equation

Also suggested:

* Look for a pattern
* Draw a picture
* Solve a simpler problem
* Use a model
* Work backward
* Use a formula
* Be creative
* Applying these rules to devise a plan takes your own skill and judgement.
Pólya lays a big emphasis on the teachers&#x27; behavior. A teacher should support students with devising their own plan with a question method that goes from the most general questions to more particular questions, with the goal that the last step to having a plan is made by the student. He maintains that just showing students a plan, no matter how good it is, does not help them.

=== Third principle: Carry out the plan ===

This step is usually easier than devising the plan. In general, all you need is care and patience, given that you have the necessary skills. Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work, discard it and choose another. Don&#x27;t be misled; this is how mathematics is done, even by professionals. 

=== Fourth principle: Review/extend ===

Pólya mentions that much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you have done, what worked and what did not, and with thinking about other problems where this could be useful. Doing this will enable you to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems, if these relate to the original problem.

== Heuristics ==
The book contains a dictionary-style set of heuristics, many of which have to do with generating a more accessible problem. For example:

== Influence ==

* The book has been translated into several languages and has sold over a million copies, and has been continuously in print since its first publication.
* Marvin Minsky said in his paper &quot;Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence&quot; that &quot;everyone should know the work of George Pólya on how to solve problems.&quot;
* Pólya&#x27;s book has had a large influence on mathematics textbooks as evidenced by the bibliographies for mathematics education.
* Russian inventor Genrich Altshuller developed an elaborate set of methods for problem solving known as TRIZ, which in many aspects reproduces or parallels Pólya&#x27;s work.
* &quot;How to Solve it by Computer&quot; is a computer science book by R. G. Dromey. It was inspired by Pólya&#x27;s work.

<doc id="320320" wikidata="Q1342422" url="?curid=320320" title="Speculum (medicine)">
<text>A speculum (Latin for &#x27;mirror&#x27;; : specula or speculums) is a medical tool for investigating body orifices, with a form dependent on the orifice for which it is designed. In old texts, the speculum may also be referred to as a diopter or dioptra. Like an endoscope, a speculum allows a view inside the body; endoscopes, however, tend to have optics while a speculum is intended for direct vision.

==History==
Vaginal and anal specula were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and speculum artifacts have been found in Pompeii. The modern vaginal speculum, developed by J. Marion Sims, consists of a hollow cylinder with a rounded end that is divided into two hinged parts, somewhat like the beak of a duck. This speculum is inserted into the vagina to dilate it for examination of the vagina and cervix.

The modern vaginal speculum was developed by J. Marion Sims, a plantation doctor in Lancaster County, United States. Between 1845 and 1849, Sims performed dozens of surgeries, without anesthesia, on at least 12 enslaved women. In these experiments, Sims developed a technique to repair fistula and in the process invented the duckbill speculum. These experiments, and the development of the modern specula, led some to regard Sims as the &quot;father of modern gynaecology.&quot;

By the 1860s, specula were integrated into criminal justice practices in the UK. In Great Britain, examinations of the cervix were made mandatory for all women convicted of prostitution by the country&#x27;s Contagious Disease Act.
In the 19th century, the vaginal speculum became a cultural symbol of the tenuous relationship between women and their physicians. Use of the speculum was generally avoided in medical practices, and most vaginal conditions were diagnosed through symptoms or palpating the abdomen. Many practitioners had moral concerns about the use of the speculum, and preferred to diagnose through palpating the abdomen. As late as 1910, physicians believed the vaginal speculum to be inferior to the &quot;educated touch.&quot;

These concerns continued into the early 20th century as the speculum became commonplace in gynecology practices. Often, nurses played a major role in ensuring the proper use of the speculum during medical exams. The 1946 and 1956 editions of a multi-volume gynecology text for nurses required that nurses remain present during examination to protect both the patient and physician from &quot;blackmail by designing persons.&quot;

, 85% of gynecologists are women. As a result of this demographic shift, the procedures around speculum use have also changed.

==Construction==
Specula have been made of glass or metal. They were generally made of stainless steel and sterilized between uses, but particularly in the 21st century, many — especially those used in emergency departments and doctor&#x27;s offices — are made of plastic, and are disposable, single-use items. Those used in surgical suites are still commonly made of stainless steel.

==Types==

Specula come in a variety of shapes based on their purpose, and a variety of sizes; in any case the cylinder or bill(s) of the instrument allow the operator a direct vision of the area of interest and the possibility to introduce instruments for further interventions such as a biopsy.

===Vaginal===

The most common specula used in gynecologic practice are varying sizes of bivalved vaginal speculum; the two bills are hinged and are &quot;closed&quot; when the speculum is inserted to facilitate its entry and &quot;opened&quot; in its final position where they can be arrested by a screw mechanism, so that the operator is freed from keeping the bills apart.

A cylindrical-shaped speculum, introduced in 2001, the dilating vaginal speculum (also known as the Veda-scope) invented by Clemens van der Weegen, inflates the vagina with filtered air. (see diagram) The device has two main functions: a) to take a normal Pap smear with a cervical brush or a cytology brush; and b) as an internal colposcope so that the operator can pivot the Veda-scope to view any part of the vagina barrel and cervix facilitated by an internal light source that can illuminate the vaginal wall and cervix with multi-coloured light filters, which can detect pre-cancerous cells with the aid of acetic acid solution and iodine solution. It also has a facility to attach a digital camera for viewing and recording. 

A specialized form of vaginal speculum is the weighted speculum, which consists of a broad half tube which is bent at about a 90-degree angle, with the channel of the tube on the exterior side of the angle. One end of the tube has a roughly spherical metal weight surrounding the channel of the speculum. A weighted speculum is placed in the vagina during vaginal surgery with the patient in the lithotomy position. The weight holds the speculum in place and frees the surgeon&#x27;s hands for other tasks.
A vaginal speculum is also used in fertility treatments, particularly artificial insemination, and allows the vaginal cavity to be opened and observed thereby facilitating the deposit of semen into the vagina.

;Cylindrical shape

;One bill


;Two bills (bivalved)
;Three bills
===Rectal===
Vaginal specula are also used for anal surgery, although several other forms of anal specula exist. One form, the anoscope, resembles a tube that has a removable bullet-shaped insert. When the anoscope is inserted into the anus, the insert dilates the anus to the diameter of the tube. The insert is then removed, leaving the tube to allow examination of the lower rectum and anus.

This style of anal speculum is one of the oldest designs for surgical instruments still in use, with examples dating back many centuries. The sigmoidoscope can be further advanced into the lower intestinal tract and requires an endoscopic set-up.

;Tubal shape
;One bill
;Two bills
;Three bills
===Nasal===

Nasal specula have two relatively flat bills with handle. The instrument is hinged so that when the handles are squeezed together the bills spread laterally, allowing examination.
Additionally, the Thudichum nasal speculum is commonly used in the outpatient examination of the nose.

===Aural===

Ear or aural specula resemble a funnel, and come in a variety of sizes.
===Eyelid===

For ophthalmic surgery such as cataract surgery, a speculum designed to retract the eyelids is used.

===Oral===
In veterinary medicine, a McPherson Speculum can be used for oral examination. The speculum helps keep the mouth open during the exam and helps avoid biting injuries.

==Non-medical use==

Specula are used for sexual pleasure, both vaginally and anally.

<doc id="320321" wikidata="Q4664626" url="?curid=320321" title="Gupta (king)">
<text>Gupta (Gupta script: &quot;Gu-pta&quot;, fl. late 3rd century CE) was the founder of the Gupta dynasty of northern India. He is identified with king Che-li-ki-to (believed to be the Chinese transcription of &quot;&quot;Shri&quot;-Gupta&quot;), who, according to the 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing, built a temple near Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no (Mṛgaśikhāvana) for Chinese pilgrims. This temple was located somewhere in eastern India: based on the identification of its location, modern scholars variously locate Gupta&#x27;s territory in present-day eastern Uttar Pradesh or Bengal region.

== Name ==

Gupta is not attested by his own inscriptions or coins, although some seals and coins have been wrongly attributed to him. The earliest description of him occurs in his great-grandson Samudragupta&#x27;s Prayagraaj Pillar inscription, and is repeated verbatim in several later records of the dynasty:

The Allahabad Pillar inscription names Samudragupta&#x27;s ancestors as &quot;Shrī&quot; Gupta ( &quot;shri gu-pta&quot;), &quot;Shrī&quot; Ghatotkacha, and &quot;Shrī&quot; Chandragupta. Some earlier scholars believed that the name of the dynasty&#x27;s founder was &quot;Shri-gupta&quot; (IAST: Śrigupta), as Gupta does not appear to be a given name. However, it is now generally agreed that &quot;Shri&quot; is an honorific title and not an integral part of the king&#x27;s name; &quot;Gupta&quot; was the actual name of the king. The Vishnu Sahasranama mentions Gupta among the 1008 names of Vishnu, which suggests that it can be used as a given name. The name derives from the word &quot;gup&quot; (&quot;to protect&quot;).

== Date ==

Gupta most probably ruled in the second half of the 3rd century, although his reign cannot be dated with certainty based on existing evidence. Various estimates of his reign include:

* R. K. Mukherjee: c. 240–280 CE
* A. S. Altekar: c. 270–290 CE
* V. A. Smith: c. 275–300 CE
* Tej Ram Sharma: c. 275–295 CE
* S. R. Goel: c. 295–300 CE

== Political status ==

The Allahabad Pillar inscription uses the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; ( &quot;Great King&quot;) for Gupta and his son Ghatotkacha, as opposed to the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; (&quot;king of great kings&quot;) for later ruler Chandragupta I. In the later period, the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; was used by feudatory rulers, which has led to suggestions that Gupta and Ghatotkacha were feudatory kings. For example, scholars R. D. Banerji and K. P. Jayaswal theorize that they were Kushana vassals.

There is no doubt that Gupta and Ghatotkacha held a lower status and were less powerful than Chandragupta I. However, there are several instances of paramount sovereigns using the title &quot;Maharaja&quot;, in both pre-Gupta and post-Gupta periods, so the use of the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; cannot be considered as conclusive evidence of Gupta&#x27;s vassal status. The sovereign kings of several contemporary or near-contemporary dynasties, including the Vakatakas, used the title &quot;Maharaja&quot;. Moreover, the Kushana Empire had already declined before the rise of the Guptas, so Gupta is unlikely to have been a Kushana vassal.

== Identification with Che-li-ki-to ==

The 7th century Chinese Buddhist monk Yijing, in his description of the itinerary of the earlier Korean traveler(of Silla) Hwui-lun(慧輪) alias Prajnavarma, mentions that in ancient times, king Che-li-ki-to (室利笈多) built a temple near Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no (Mṛgaśikhāvana) for Chinese pilgrims. The king endowed the temple with the revenue of 24 villages for its maintenance. Only the brick foundation of this temple survived in Yijing&#x27;s time.

Numismatist John Allan read Che-li-ki-to as a transcription of Shri-Gupta. J. F. Fleet opposed this theory, pointing out that according to Yijing&#x27;s writings, Che-li-ki-to flourished five hundred years before him (that is, in the second century), while Gupta ruled in the late 3rd century. Moreover, the Gupta inscriptions mention the king&#x27;s name as &quot;Gupta&quot; (which would be transcribed as &quot;ki-to&quot;, 笈多), not &quot;Shri-gupta&quot; (&quot;Che-li-ki-to&quot;). Allan argued that Yijing&#x27;s statement about the king&#x27;s date should not be taken literally, and that the Chinese writers visiting India often used &quot;Shri&quot; as an honorific.

Based on available evidence, Gupta&#x27;s religious affiliation is unclear. Historian A. K. Narain theorizes that he was a Vaishnavite, who was tolerant of Buddhist activity in his kingdom. This latter scenario would have been comparable with the later Gupta monarchs, who were predominantly Vaishnavite, but under whose regimes heterodox religious movements like Buddhism and Jainism were allowed to flourish.

Some scholars, such as D. C. Ganguly and R. C. Majumdar, have interpreted Yijing&#x27;s description to mean that the temple was located more than 40 &quot;yojana&quot;s east of Nalanda, along the Ganga river, and have identified its location in present-day Bengal region. Majumdar read Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no as a transcription of Mriga-sthapana, the name of a stupa which was located in the historical Varendra region of Bengal. According to Ganguly, this suggests that the Gupta dynasty originated in Bengal, while according to Majumdar, this only proves that Bengal was a part of Gupta&#x27;s kingdom.

Other scholars, such as B. P. Sinha and Jagannath Agrawal, read Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no of Yijing&#x27;s account as a transcription of Mriga-shikha-vana (IAST: &quot;Mṛgaśikhāvana&quot;), and identify it with Mrigadaya (Deer Park) in Sarnath, in present-day eastern Uttar Pradesh. Ashvini Agrawal argues that Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no is not an exact transcription of Mriga-sthapana: Mriga-shikha-vana is closer, and a different interpretation of Yijing&#x27;s writings suggests that Mi-li-kia-si-kia-po-no was located in Sarnath. Sinha theorizes that Hwui-lun erroneously mentioned its location as east of Nalanda. These historians propose that the Gupta dynasty originated in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

<text>A causeway is a track, road or railway on the upper point of an embankment across &quot;a low, or wet place, or piece of water&quot;. It can be constructed of earth, masonry, wood, or concrete. One of the earliest known wooden causeways is the Sweet Track in the Somerset Levels, England, which dates from the Neolithic age. Timber causeways may also be described as both boardwalks and bridges.

== Etymology ==

When first used, the word &quot;causeway&quot; appeared in a form such as &quot;causey way&quot;, making clear its derivation from the earlier form &quot;causey&quot;. This word seems to have come from the same source by two different routes. It derives ultimately, from the Latin for heel, , and most likely comes from the trampling technique to consolidate earthworks.

Originally, the construction of a causeway used earth that had been trodden upon to compact and harden it as much as possible, one layer at a time, often by slaves or flocks of sheep. Today, this work is done by machines. The same technique would have been used for road embankments, raised river banks, sea banks and fortification earthworks.

The second derivation route is simply the hard, trodden surface of a path. The name by this route came to be applied to any firmly surfaced road. It is now little-used except in dialect and in the names of roads which were originally notable for their solidly made surface. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states: &quot;causey, a mound or dam, which is derived, through the Norman-French (cf. modern ), from the late Latin , a road stamped firm with the feet (, to tread).&quot;

The word is comparable in both meanings with the French &quot;&quot;, from a form of which it reached English by way of Norman French. The French adjective carries the meaning of having been given a hardened surface and is used to mean either paved or shod. As a noun is used on the one hand for a metalled carriageway, and on the other for an embankment with or without a road.

Other languages have a noun with similar dual meaning. In Welsh, it is . The Welsh is relevant here, as it also has a verb , meaning to trample. The trampling and ramming technique for consolidating earthworks was used in fortifications and there is a comparable, outmoded form of wall construction technique, used in such work and known as pisé, a word derived not from trampling but from ramming or tamping. The Welsh word translates directly to the English word &#x27;causeway&#x27;; it is possible that, with Welsh being a lineal linguistic descendant of the original native British tongues, the English word derives from the Welsh.

A transport corridor that is carried instead on a series of arches, perhaps approaching a bridge, is a viaduct; a short stretch of viaduct is called an overpass. The distinction between the terms &quot;causeway&quot; and &quot;viaduct&quot; becomes blurred when flood-relief culverts are incorporated, though generally a causeway refers to a roadway supported mostly by earth or stone, while a bridge supports a roadway between piers (which may be embedded in embankments). Some low causeways across shore waters become inaccessible when covered at high tide.

==History==
The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan had causeways supporting roads and aqueducts. One of the oldest engineered roads yet discovered is the Sweet Track in England. Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, the track was a walkway consisting mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, driven into the underlying peat.

In East Africa, the Husuni Kubwa (the &quot;Great Fort&quot;), situated outside the town of Kilwa, was an early 14th-century sultan&#x27;s palace and emporium that contained causeways and platforms at the entrance of the Harbour made from blocks of reef and coral nearly a meter high. These acted as breakwaters, allowing mangroves to grow which is one of the ways the breakwater can be spotted from a distance. Some parts of the causeway are made from the bedrock, but usually the bedrock was used as a base. Coral stone was also used to build up the causeways, with sand and lime being used to cement the cobbles together. However, some of the stones were left loose.

In Scotland, the skirmish known as Clense the Calsey, or Cleanse the Causeway, took place in the High Street of Edinburgh in 1520.

In the 18th century, Dahomey lacked an effective navy hence it built causeways for naval purposes starting in 1774.

==Engineering==

The modern embankment may be constructed within a &quot;cofferdam&quot;: two parallel steel sheet pile or concrete retaining walls, anchored to each other with steel cables or rods. This construction may also serve as a dyke that keeps two bodies of water apart, such as bodies with a different water level on each side, or with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. This may also be the primary purpose of a structure, the road providing a hardened crest for the dike, slowing erosion in the event of an overflow. It also provides access for maintenance as well perhaps, as a public service.

==Examples==

Notable causeways include those that connect Singapore and Malaysia (the Johor-Singapore Causeway), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (25-km long King Fahd Causeway) and Venice to the mainland, all of which carry roadways and railways. In the Netherlands there are a number of prominent dikes which also double as causeways, including the Afsluitdijk, Brouwersdam, and Markerwaarddijk. In the Republic of Panama a causeway connects the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos to Panama City on the mainland. It also serves as a breakwater for ships entering the Panama Canal.

Causeways are also common in Florida, where low bridges may connect several human-made islands, often with a much higher bridge (or part of a single bridge) in the middle so that taller boats may pass underneath safely. Causeways are most often used to connect the barrier islands with the mainland. In the case of the Courtney Campbell Causeway, however, the mainland (Hillsborough County) is connected by a causeway to a peninsula (Pinellas County). A well-known causeway is the NASA Causeway connecting the town of Titusville on the Florida mainland to the rocket-launching facility at the Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island.

The Churchill Barriers in Orkney are some of the most notable sets of causeways in Europe. Constructed in waters up to 18 metres deep, the four barriers link five islands on the eastern side of the natural harbour at Scapa Flow. They were built during World War II as military defences for the harbour, on the orders of Winston Churchill.

The Estrada do Istmo connecting the islands of Taipa and Coloane in Macau was initially built as a causeway. The sea on both sides of the causeway then became shallower as a result of silting, and mangroves began to conquer the area. Later, land reclamation took place on both sides of the road and the area has subsequently been named Cotai and become home to several casino complexes.

==Disadvantages==

Unlike tunnels or bridges, causeways do not permit shipping through the strait which can cause problems. In some cases, causeways were built with &quot;gates&quot; or other facilities to permit shipping to pass through. 

===Ecological consequences===

Causeways affect currents and may therefore be involved in beach erosion or changed deposition patterns; this effect has been a problem at the Hindenburgdamm in northern Germany. During hurricane seasons, the winds and rains of approaching tropical storms—as well as waves generated by the storm in the surrounding bodies of water—make traversing causeways problematic at best and impossibly dangerous during the fiercest parts of the storms. For this reason (and related reasons, such as the need to minimize traffic jams on both the roads approaching the causeway and the causeway itself), emergency evacuation of island residents is a high priority for local, regional, and even national authorities.

Causeways can separate populations of wildlife, putting further pressure on endangered species.

Causeways can cause a mineral imbalance between portions of a body of water. For example, a causeway built in the Great Salt Lake has caused the northern half of the lake to have much higher salinity, to the point that the two halves show a major color imbalance (as can be seen in the image at right). Furthermore, the difference in salinity has become so severe that native brine shrimp cannot survive in much of the waters, with the northern part being too salty and the southern part being insufficiently salty.

<text>Eythorne is a civil parish and small village located 7.3 miles north-northwest of Dover in Kent, with a combined population of approximately 2,500 residents including nearby villages Barfrestone and Elvington. Although not classed as one of the former pit villages of Kent, it was only about a mile from Tilmanstone – which closed in 1986. Today many of its residents commute to work in Dover, Deal and Canterbury. 

Eythorne Baptist Church is more than 450 years old and one of the first Baptist churches in the United Kingdom. Esther Copley, wife of William Copley, who was a minister in Eythorne from about 1839 to 1843, was a prolific and successful writer of children&#x27;s books and books on the domestic economy. She died in the village in 1851.

Eythorne once had three pubs; The Crown is still trading, but the White Horse and the Palm Tree are long closed, both now being residential properties.

Eythorne is historically divided into two halves: Lower Eythorne, where the Church of England and Roman Catholic churches are situated, and Upper Eythorne, where the village shop and the Crown public house are located, and where most of today&#x27;s villagers live. Many reside in the small housing developments that sprang up in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Governance==
Eythorne is in the electoral ward called Eythorne and Shepherdswell. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,815.

==Transport==
There are buses to Dover and Canterbury, located 13 miles away. The nearest railway station is 3 miles away in the nearby village of Shepherdswell. The village is on the heritage East Kent Railway.

== Amenities==
Eythorne has a post office, a primary school, a pub and a village shop.

<doc id="320327" wikidata="Q1308649" url="?curid=320327" title="Skate or Die!">
<text>Skate or Die! is a skateboarding video game released by Electronic Arts (EA) in 1987 for the Commodore 64. It is EA&#x27;s first internally developed game. Versions for the Apple II, MS-DOS, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum followed. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami, published under the company&#x27;s Ultra Games branding.

==Gameplay==

In the style of the Epyx &quot;Games&quot; series, players can compete in five different skateboarding events, either individually or sequentially. When the events are challenged sequentially, up to eight players could sign up to participate.

The game featured two half-pipe events - the freestyle ramp and the high jump, two downhill events - the downhill race (in a park setting) and the downhill jam (in a street setting), and the pool joust. The pool joust, downhill jam, and the downhill race (in two player mode only) were all head to head, while the ramp events were single player. Except for the joust, which was a hand-to-hand knockout competition (literally and figuratively), all the event winners were decided by a point system.
Four characters were featured in &quot;Skate or Die!&quot;: Rodney Recloose, a wild man with a purple mohawk and a Marine Corps tattoo (and a facial resemblance to comedian Rodney Dangerfield) who runs a skateshop in the game, and his son Bionic Lester, an even wilder kid with a green flattop, who the player character was able to take on in the joust and the downhill jam. In the joust, Lester and his two cronies await the skater. Poseur Pete challenges beginners and Aggro Eddie takes on intermediate players, leaving Lester with the advanced pros.

==Development==
Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins was looking for a way to capitalize off of the success of the Epyx sports games, but at the time, only being a publishing/distributing company, there was little he could do. He decided to hire programmers to make a game that would cash in on this success. Right around the same time, several Epyx programmers and graphic artists quit over Epyx&#x27; decision to bring Atari Corporation in to market and manufacture their console project (later known as the Atari Lynx). Trip Hawkins found out about these programmers leaving Epyx and reached out to hire these programmers for the purpose of producing a sports series of games. The idea for a skateboarding style game came from Producer Don Traeger, who had been inspired by a coin-operated skateboarding game from Atari called &quot;720°&quot;. Trip Hawkins also hired Rob Hubbard to come over from England to compose the title screen music.

The Atari ST conversion was contracted to Codemasters, who contracted Kinetic Designs to do the work. It was scheduled to be released in June 1989 but was never released.

==Reception==
Yung Min Choi reviewed the game for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and wrote that &quot;&quot;Skate or Die&quot; is an enjoyable game for teenage board freaks who cannot get enough radical action on the cement or &quot;over-the-hill&quot; adults who don&#x27;t want to risk their lives and limbs to experience the simulated thrill of this action sport&quot;.

The C64 version of &quot;Skate or Die!&quot; was also well liked for its introductory music, a catchy rock-flavored tune with digital samples that took full advantage of the SID chip&#x27;s capabilities. Composed by Rob Hubbard, it has become a popular tune among modern fans of SID music and remixers of such tunes. For Konami&#x27;s NES port, Kouji Murata composed an arranged version of the tune for the NES&#x27;s Ricoh 2A03 sound chip.

The game sold just over 100,000 copies between its release date and the end of the NES era.
The game was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #132 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

==Legacy==
A winterized sequel, &quot;Ski or Die&quot;, was released in 1990 for the Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, PC, and NES, and a true sequel, &quot;Skate or Die 2&quot; was published in 1990 for the NES. &quot;Ski or Die&quot; retained the multi-event format while &quot;Skate or Die 2&quot; veered into &quot;adventure&quot; territory. Both games featured Rodney and Lester.

In 2002, Criterion Games, creators of the &quot;Burnout&quot; series, was working on a &quot;Skate or Die&quot; remake or sequel for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Due to Criterion having issues with Electronic Arts, the game was cancelled in 2003 in favor of &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;. It was in development for 12 months before it was cancelled.

In 2007, the NES version was re-released for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service in Europe (excluding France) and Australia.

<text>The National Railway Company of Belgium (, NMBS; , SNCB; ) is the national railway company of Belgium. The company formally styles itself using the Dutch and French abbreviations NMBS/SNCB. The corporate logo designed in 1936 by Henry van de Velde consists of the linguistically neutral letter B in a horizontal oval.

==History==
NMBS/SNCB is an autonomous government company, formed in 1926 as successor to the Belgian State Railways. From 1942 to 1944, amid Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Belgium, the company was paid 51 million Belgian francs by the Nazi Germany to send 28 trains carrying 25,843 Jews and Roma people to Auschwitz where only 1,195 survived. The company also sent 16,000 political prisoners to concentration camps.

In 2005, the company was split up into three parts: Infrabel, which manages the railway infrastructure, network operations, and network access, the public railway operator NMBS/SNCB itself to manage the freight (B-Cargo) and passenger services, and NMBS/SNCB-Holding, which owns both public companies and supervises the collaboration between them. Essentially, this was a move to facilitate future liberalisation of railway freight and passenger services in agreement with European regulations. Several freight operators have since received access permissions for the Belgian network. In February 2011, NMBS/SNCB Logistics began operating as a separate business.

Faced with rising losses, in June 2012, the Belgian transport minister announced further reform: NMBS/SNCB Holding would be split up, so NMBS/SNCB (the train operator) would be separate from Infrabel (the infrastructure owner). Unions oppose the reform.

NMBS/SNCB-Holding was merged into NMBS/SNCB in 2014 in order to simplify the structure of the Belgian railways.

NMBS/SNCB holds a Royal Warrant from the Court of Belgium.

==Operations==

In 2008 NMBS/SNCB carried 207 million passengers a total of 8,676 million passenger-kilometres over a network of (of which are electrified, mainly at and at ). In 2024, that number rose to 245 million passengers carried. The rail network has expanded to of which are electrified.

The network currently includes four high speed lines suitable for traffic: HSL 1 runs from just south of Brussels to the French border, where it continues to a triangular junction with LGV Nord for and (and London beyond that), HSL 2 runs from to and onward to , HSL 3 runs from Liège to the German border near Aachen and HSL 4 connects with HSL-Zuid in the Netherlands to allow services to run from to .

<doc id="320336" wikidata="Q479448" url="?curid=320336" title="Hand axe">
<text>A hand axe (or handaxe or [[Acheulean]] hand axe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces that is the longest-used tool in human history. It is made from stone, usually flint or chert that has been &quot;reduced&quot; and shaped from a larger piece by knapping, or hitting against another stone. They are characteristic of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods, roughly 1.6 million years ago to about 100,000 years ago, and used by &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and other early humans, but rarely by &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

Their technical name (biface) comes from the fact that the archetypical model is a generally bifacial (with two wide sides or faces) and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal) lithic flake. Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic almond shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.

Hand axes were the first prehistoric tools to be recognized as such: the first published representation of a hand axe was drawn by John Frere and appeared in a British publication in 1800. Until that time, their origins were thought to be natural or supernatural. They were called &quot;thunderstones&quot;, because popular tradition held that they had fallen from the sky during storms or were formed inside the earth by a lightning strike and then appeared at the surface. They are used in some rural areas as an amulet to protect against storms.

Handaxes are generally thought to have been primarily used as cutting tools, with the wide base serving as an ergonomic area for the hand to grip the tool, though other uses, such as throwing weapons and use as social and sexual signaling have been proposed.

==Terminology==
The four classes of hand axe are:

# Large, thick hand axes reduced from cores or thick flakes, referred to as blanks
# Thinned blanks. While form remains rough and uncertain, an effort has been made to reduce the thickness of the flake or core
# Either a preform or crude formalized tool, such as an adze
# Finer formalized tool types such as projectile points and fine bifaces

While Class 4 hand axes are referred to as &quot;formalized tools&quot;, bifaces from any stage of a lithic reduction sequence may be used as tools. (Other biface typologies make five divisions rather than four.)

French antiquarian André Vayson de Pradenne introduced the word in 1920. This term co-exists with the more popular &quot;hand axe&quot; (), that was coined by Gabriel de Mortillet much earlier. The continued use of the word biface by François Bordes and Lionel Balout supported its use in France and Spain, where it replaced the term &quot;hand axe&quot;. Use of the expression &quot;hand axe&quot; has continued in English as the equivalent of the French ( in Spanish), while biface applies more generally for any piece that has been carved on both sides by the removal of shallow or deep flakes. The expression is used in German; it can be literally translated as hand axe, although in a stricter sense it means &quot;fist wedge&quot;. It is the same in Dutch where the expression used is which literally means &quot;fist axe&quot;. The same locution occurs in other languages.

However, the general impression of these tools was based on ideal (or classic) pieces that were of such perfect shape that they caught the attention of non-experts. Their typology broadened the term&#x27;s meaning. Biface hand axes and bifacial lithic items are distinguished. A hand axe need not be a bifacial item and many bifacial items are not hand axes. Nor were hand axes and bifacial items exclusive to the Lower Palaeolithic period in the Old World. They appear throughout the world and in many different pre-historical epochs, without necessarily implying an ancient origin. Lithic typology is not a reliable chronological reference and was abandoned as a dating system. Examples of this include the &quot;quasi-bifaces&quot; that sometimes appear in strata from the Gravettian, Solutrean and Magdalenian periods in France and Spain, the crude bifacial pieces of the Lupemban culture (9000 B.C.) or the tools found near Sagua La Grande in Cuba. The word &quot;biface&quot; refers to something different in English than in French or in Spanish, which could lead to many misunderstandings. Bifacially carved cutting tools, similar to hand axes, were used to clear scrub vegetation throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. These tools are similar to more modern adzes and were a cheaper alternative to polished axes. The modern day villages along the Sepik river in New Guinea continue to use tools that are virtually identical to hand axes to clear forest. &quot;The term &quot;biface&quot; should be reserved for items from before the Würm II-III interstadial&quot;, although certain later objects could &quot;exceptionally&quot; be called bifaces.

&quot;Hand axe&quot; does not relate to &quot;axe&quot;, which was overused in lithic typology to describe a wide variety of stone tools. At the time the use of such items was not understood. In the particular case of Palaeolithic hand axes the term axe is an inadequate description. Lionel Balout stated, &quot;the term should be rejected as an erroneous interpretation of these objects that are not &#x27;axes. Subsequent studies supported this idea, particularly those examining the signs of use.

==Materials==
Hand axes are mainly made of flint, but rhyolites, phonolites, quartzites and other coarse rocks were used as well. Obsidian, natural volcanic glass, shatters easily and was rarely used.

==Uses==
Most researchers think that handaxes were primarily used as cutting tools. The pioneers of Palaeolithic tool studies first suggested that bifaces were used as axes despite the fact that they have a sharp border all around. Other uses seem to show that hand axes were a multi-functional tool, leading some to describe them as the &quot;Acheulean Swiss Army knife&quot;. Other academics have suggested that the hand axe was simply a byproduct of being used as a core to make other tools, a weapon, or was perhaps used ritually.
Wells proposed in 1899 that hand axes were used as missile weapons to hunt prey – an interpretation supported by Calvin, who suggested that some of the rounder specimens of Acheulean hand axes were used as hunting projectiles or as &quot;killer frisbees&quot; meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a water hole so as to stun one of them. This assertion was inspired by findings from the Olorgesailie archaeological site in Kenya. Few specimens indicate hand axe hafting, and some are too large for that use. However, few hand axes show signs of heavy damage indicative of throwing, modern experiments have shown the technique to often result in flat-faced landings, and many modern scholars consider the &quot;hurling&quot; theory to be poorly conceived but so attractive that it has taken a life of its own.

As hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, they could have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it may be misleading to think of them as &quot;axes&quot;, they could have been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. However, other tools, such as small knives, are better suited for some of these tasks, and many hand axes have been found with no traces of use.

Baker suggested that since so many hand axes have been found that have no retouching, perhaps the hand axe was not itself a tool, but a large lithic core from which flakes had been removed and used as tools (flake core theory). On the other hand, there are many hand axes found with retouching such as sharpening or shaping, which casts doubt on this idea.

Other theories suggest the shape is part tradition and part by-product of its manufacture. Many early hand axes appear to be made from simple rounded pebbles (from river or beach deposits). It is necessary to detach a &#x27;starting flake&#x27;, often much larger than the rest of the flakes (due to the oblique angle of a rounded pebble requiring greater force to detach it), thus creating an asymmetry. Correcting the asymmetry by removing material from the other faces, encouraged a more pointed (oval) form factor. (Knapping a completely circular hand axe requires considerable correction of the shape.) Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, revealed that the hand axe was able to expose bone marrow.

Kohn and Mithen independently arrived at the explanation that symmetric hand axes were favoured by sexual selection as fitness indicators. Kohn in his book &quot;As We Know It&quot; wrote that the hand axe is &quot;a highly visible indicator of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice.&quot; Miller followed their example and said that hand axes have characteristics that make them subject to sexual selection, such as that they were made for over a million years throughout Africa, Europe and Asia, they were made in large numbers, and most were impractical for utilitarian use. He claimed that a single design persisting across time and space cannot be explained by cultural imitation and draws a parallel between bowerbirds&#x27; (built to attract potential mates and used only during courtship) and Pleistocene hominids&#x27; hand axes. He called hand axe building a &quot;genetically inherited propensity to construct a certain type of object.&quot; He discards the idea that they were used as missile weapons because more efficient weapons were available, such as javelins. Although he accepted that some hand axes may have been used for practical purposes, he agreed with Kohn and Mithen who showed that many hand axes show considerable skill, design and symmetry beyond that needed for utility. Some were too big, such as the Maritime Academy handaxe or the &quot;Great Hand Axe&quot; found in Furze Platt, England that is 30.6 cm long (other scholars measure it as 39.5 cm long). Some were too small - less than two inches. Some were &quot;overdetermined&quot;, featuring symmetry beyond practical requirements and showing evidence of unnecessary attention to form and finish. Some were actually made out bone instead of stone and thus were not very practical, suggesting a cultural or ritual use. Miller thinks that the most important clue is that under electron microscopy hand axes show no signs of use or evidence of edge wear. Others argue that little evidence for use-wear simply relates to the particular sedimentological conditions, rather than being evidence of discarding without use. It has been noted that hand axes can be good handicaps in Zahavi&#x27;s handicap principle theory: learning costs are high, risks of injury, they require physical strength, hand-eye coordination, planning, patience, pain tolerance and resistance to infection from cuts and bruises when making or using such a hand axe.

===Evidence from wear analysis===
The use-wear analysis of Palaeolithic hand axes is carried out on findings from emblematic sites across nearly all of Western Europe. Keeley and Semenov were the pioneers of this specialized investigation. Keeley stated, &quot;The morphology of typical hand axes suggests a greater range of potential activities than those of flakes&quot;.

Many problems need to be overcome in carrying out this type of analysis. One is the difficulty in observing larger pieces with a microscope. Of the millions of known pieces and despite their long role in human history, few have been thoroughly studied. Another arises from the clear evidence that the same tasks were performed more effectively using utensils made from flakes:
Keeley based his observations on archaeological sites in England. He proposed that in base settlements where it was possible to predict future actions and where greater control on routine activities was common, the preferred tools were made from specialized flakes, such as racloirs, backed knives, scrapers and punches. However, hand axes were more suitable on expeditions and in seasonal camps, where unforeseen tasks were more common. Their main advantage in these situations was the lack of specialization and adaptability to multiple eventualities. A hand axe has a long blade with different curves and angles, some sharper and others more resistant, including points and notches. All of this is combined in one tool. Given the right circumstances, it is possible to make use of loose flakes. In the same book, Keeley states that a number of the hand axes studied were used as knives to cut meat (such as hand axes from Hoxne and Caddington). He identified that the point of another hand axe had been used as a clockwise drill. This hand axe came from Clacton-on-Sea (all of these sites are located in the east of England). Toth reached similar conclusions for pieces from the Spanish site in Ambrona (Soria). Analysis carried out by Domínguez-Rodrigo and co-workers on the primitive Acheulean site in Peninj (Tanzania) on a series of tools dated 1.5 mya shows clear microwear produced by plant phytoliths, suggesting that the hand axes were used to work wood. Among other uses, use-wear evidence for fire making has been identified on dozens of later Middle Palaeolithic hand axes from France, suggesting Neanderthals struck these tools with the mineral pyrite to produce sparks at least 50,000 years ago.
====Macroscopic traces====
Some hand axes were used with force that left clearly visible marks. Other visible marks can be left as the scars from retouching, on occasion it is possible to distinguish them from marks left by the initial manufacture. One of the most common cases is when a point breaks. This was seen at sites in Europe, Africa and Asia. One example comes from the El Basalito site in Salamanca, where excavation uncovered fragments of a hand axe with marks at the tip that appeared to be the result of the action of a wedge, which would have subjected the object to high levels of torsion that broke the tip. A break or extreme wear can affect a tool&#x27;s point or any other part. Such wear was reworked by means of a secondary working as discussed above. In some cases this reconstruction is easily identifiable and was carried out using techniques such as the (French, meaning &quot;tranchet blow&quot;), or simply with scale or scalariform retouches that alter an edge&#x27;s symmetry and line.
==Forms==

The most characteristic and common shape is a pointed area at one end, cutting edges along its side and a rounded base (this includes hand axes with a lanceolate and amygdaloidal shape as well as others from the family). The axes are almost always symmetrical despite studies showing that hand axe symmetry does not help in tasks such as skinning animals. While there is a &quot;typical&quot; shape to most hand axes, there are some displaying a variety of shapes, including circular, triangular and elliptical—calling in to question the contention that they had a constant and only symbolic significance. They are typically between long, although they can be bigger or smaller.
They were typically made from a rounded stone, a block or lithic flake, using a hammer to remove flakes from both sides of the item. This hammer can be made of hard stone, or of wood or antler. The latter two, softer hammers can produce more delicate results. However, a hand axe&#x27;s technological aspect can reflect more differences. For example, uniface tools have only been worked on one side and partial bifaces retain a high proportion of the natural cortex of the tool stone, often making them easy to confuse with chopping tools. Further, simple bifaces may have been created from a suitable tool stone, but they rarely show evidence of retouching. Later hand axes were improved by the use of the Levallois technique to make the more sophisticated and lighter Levallois core.

In summary, hand axes are recognized by many typological schools under different archaeological paradigms and are quite recognisable (at least the most typical examples). However, they have not been definitively categorized. Stated more formally, the idealised model combines a series of well-defined properties, but no set of these properties are necessary or sufficient to identify a hand axe.
==History and distribution==
In 1969 in the 2nd edition of &quot;World Prehistory&quot;, Grahame Clark proposed an evolutionary progression of flint-knapping industries (also known as complexes or technocomplexes) in which the &quot;dominant lithic technologies&quot; occurred in a fixed sequence where simple Oldowan one-edged tools were replaced by these more complex Acheulean hand axes, which were then eventually replaced by the even more complex Mousterian tools made with the Levallois technique.

The oldest known Oldowan tools were found in Gona, Ethiopia. These are dated to about 2.6 mya.

Early examples of hand axes date back to 1.6 mya in the later Oldowan (Mode I), called the &quot;developed Oldowan&quot; by Mary Leakey. These hand axes became more abundant in mode II Acheulean industries that appeared in Southern Ethiopia around 1.4 mya. Some of the best specimens come from 1.2 mya deposits in Olduvai Gorge.

By 1.8 mya early man was present in Europe. Remains of their activities were excavated in Spain at sites in the Guadix-Baza basin and near Atapuerca. Most early European sites yield &quot;mode 1&quot; or Oldowan assemblages. The earliest Acheulean sites in Europe appear around 0.5 mya. In addition, the Acheulean tradition did not spread to Eastern Asia. In Europe and particularly in France and England, the oldest hand axes appear after the Beestonian Glaciation–Mindel Glaciation, approximately 750,000 years ago, during the so-called &quot;Cromerian complex&quot;. They became more widely produced during the Abbevillian tradition.

The apogee of hand axe manufacture took place in a wide area of the Old World, especially during the Riss glaciation, in a cultural complex that can be described as &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; and which is known as the Acheulean. The use of hand axes survived the Middle Palaeolithic in a much smaller area and were especially important during the Mousterian, up to the middle of the Last glacial period.

Hand axes dating from the lower Palaeolithic were found on the Asian continent, on the Indian subcontinent and in the Middle East (to the south of parallel 40° N), but they were absent from the area to the east of the 90° E meridian. Movius designated a border (the so-called Movius Line) between the cultures that used hand axes to the west and those that made chopping tools and small retouched lithic flakes, such as were made by Peking Man and the Ordos culture in China, or their equivalents in Indochina such as the Hoabinhian. However, Movius&#x27; hypothesis was proved incorrect when many hand axes made in Palaeolithic era were found in 1978 at Hantan River, Jeongok, Yeoncheon County, South Korea for the first time in East Asia. Some of them are exhibited at the Jeongok Prehistory Museum, South Korea.

The Padjitanian culture from Java was traditionally thought to be the only oriental culture to manufacture hand axes. However, a site in Baise, Guangxi, China shows that hand axes were made in eastern Asia.

Hand axe technology is almost unknown in Australian prehistory, although a few have been found.

==Construction==
Experiments in knapping have demonstrated the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made, which could help explain their success. In addition, they demand relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a conchoidal fracture. With early hand axes, it is easy to improvise their manufacture, correct mistakes without requiring detailed planning, and no long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the necessary techniques. These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective in a variety of tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.

Later examples of hand axes are more sophisticated with their use of two layers of knapping (one made with stone knapping and one made with bone knapping).

Lastly, a hand axe represents a prototype that can be refined giving rise to more developed, specialised and sophisticated tools such as the tips of various projectiles, knives, adzes and hatchets.

==Analysis==
Given the typological difficulties in defining the essence of a hand axe, it is important when analysing them to take account of their archaeological context (geographical location, stratigraphy, the presence of other elements associated with the same level, chronology etc.). It is necessary to study their physical state to establish any natural alterations that may have occurred: patina, shine, wear and tear, mechanical, thermal and / or physical-chemical changes such as cracking, in order to distinguish these factors from the scars left during the tool&#x27;s manufacture or use.

The raw material is an important factor, because of the result that can be obtained by working it and in order to reveal the economy and movement of prehistoric humans. In the Olduvai Gorge the raw materials were most readily available some ten kilometres from the nearest settlements. However, flint or silicate is readily available on the fluvial terraces of Western Europe. This means that different strategies were required for the procurement and use of available resources. The supply of materials was the most important factor in the manufacturing process as Palaeolithic artisans were able to adapt their methods to available materials, obtaining adequate results from even the most difficult raw materials. Despite this it is important to study the rock&#x27;s grain, texture, the presence of joints, veins, impurities or shatter cones etc.

In order to study the use of individual items it is necessary to look for traces of wear such as pseudo-retouches, breakage or wear, including areas that are polished. If the item is in a good condition it is possible to submit it to use-wear analysis, which is discussed in more detail below. Apart from these generalities, which are common to all carved archaeological pieces, hand axes need a technical analysis of their manufacture and a morphological analysis.

===Technical analysis===
The technical analysis of a hand axe tries to discover each of the phases in its &quot;chaîne opératoire&quot; (operational sequence). The chain is highly flexible, as a toolmaker may focus narrowly on just one of the sequence&#x27;s links or equally on each link. The links examined in this type of study start with the extraction methods of the raw material, then include the actual manufacture of the item, its use, maintenance throughout its working life, and finally its disposal.

A toolmaker may put a lot of effort into finding the highest quality raw material or the most suitable tool stone. In this way more effort is invested in obtaining a good foundation, but time is saved on shaping the stone: that is, the effort is focused on the start of the operational chain. Equally the artisan may concentrate the most effort in the manufacture so that the quality or suitability of the raw material is less important. This will minimize the initial effort, but will result in a greater effort at the end of the operational chain.

====Tool stone and cortex====

Hand axes are most commonly made from rounded pebbles or nodules, but many are also made from a large flake. Hand axes made from flakes first appeared at the start of the Acheulean period and became more common with time. Manufacturing a hand axe from a flake is actually easier than from a pebble. It is also quicker, as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer knaps are required to finish the tool; it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a hand axe made from a flake, it should be remembered that its shape was predetermined (by use of the Levallois technique or Kombewa technique or similar). 

The natural external cortex or &quot;rind&quot; of the tool stone, which is due to erosion and the physical-chemical alterations of weathering, is different from the stone&#x27;s interior. In the case of chert, quartz or quartzite, this alteration is basically mechanical, and apart from the colour and the wear it has the same characteristics as the interior in terms of hardness, toughness etc. However, flint is surrounded by a limestone cortex that is soft and unsuitable for stone tools. As hand axes are made from a tool stone&#x27;s core, it is normal to indicate the thickness and position of the cortex in order to better understand the techniques that are required in their manufacture. The variation in cortex between utensils should not be taken as an indication of their age.

Many partially-worked hand axes do not require further work in order to be effective tools. They can be considered to be simple hand axes. Less suitable tool stone requires more thorough working. In some specimens the cortex is unrecognisable due to the complete working that it has undergone, which has eliminated any vestige of the original cortex.

==Types==
It is possible to distinguish multiple types of hand axe:

*Uniface—flaked on one face with cortex completely covering the other side. This characteristic does not disqualify such tools as hand axes and gives no indication of their age.
*Partial biface—The cortex is present on the tool&#x27;s base and central part. The overall area that is not knapped may extend to up to two thirds of its length.
*Bifaces with basal cortex coverage—Only the artefact&#x27;s base is covered with cortex, which does not cover more than a third of total length. In some cases the cortex is present on both the base and one side, thereby affecting one edge: such tools are called &quot;natural backed&quot;. De Mortillet emphasised the importance of the presence or absence of the cortex around the edge in the 19th century: &quot;Even on some of the best worked pieces it is common to see, sometimes on the base but more often on the side, a small area that has not been worked, that is uncut. It could be thought that this is a mistake or an error. But often the most probable reason for this is that it was intentional. There are a large number of hand axes with an uncut base, unworked or partially cleaned ... an area has intentionally been left on these pieces as a grip, it is called the heel. This heel acts as a handle as it is easy to grip&quot;. (This hypothesis remains unproven and is not commonly used.)

*Hand axes with residual cortex on an edge—The whole of their edges are knapped except for a small area where the cortex remains (leaving a small area without a sharp edge). This area can be at the base, side or oblique. In all cases it is small, leaving cutting edges on both sides.
*Hand axes with a cutting edge around the whole circumference—The circumference is knapped to a cutting edge, although some residual areas of cortex may persist on either face, without affecting the cutting edge&#x27;s effectiveness.

==Production==
Older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Mousterian hand axes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border. An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.

The manufacturing process employs lithic reduction. This phase is commonly thought of as the most important in hand axe fabrication, although it is not always used, such as for hand axes made from flakes or a suitable tool stone. An important concern is the implement that has been used to form the biface. If multiple implements were used, it is essential to discover in what order they were used and the result obtained by each one. The most common implements are:
===Hard hammer faces===
Hand axes can be made without subsequent reworking of the edges. A hammerstone was the most common percussive tool used during the Acheulean. The resulting artefact is usually easily recognizable given its size and irregular edges, as the removed flakes leave pronounced percussion bulbs and compression rings. A hammerstone produces a small number of flakes that are wide and deep leaving long edges on the tool as their highly concave form yields curving edges. The cross-section is irregular, often sub-rhombic, while the intersection between the faces forms an acute angle of between 60° and 90° degrees. The shape is similar to that of the core as the irregularities formed during knapping are not removed. The notches obtained were exploited in the production sequence. It is common that this type of manufacture yields &quot;partial bifaces&quot; (an incomplete working that leaves many areas covered with cortex), &quot;unifaces&quot; (tools that have only been worked on one face), &quot;bifaces in the Abbevillian style&quot; and &quot;nucleiform bifaces&quot;. This type of manufacturing style is generally an indication of the age when a tool was made and with other archaeological data can provide a context that allows its age to be estimated.

===Hard hammer faces and edges===

These hand axes have a more balanced appearance as the modification consists of a second (or third) series of blows to make the piece more uniform and provide a better finish. The modification is often called retouching and is sometimes carried out using invasive retouching or using softer, marginal, shallow blows that are only applied to the most marked irregularities leaving scale-like marks. The modification of edges with a hard hammer was carried out from the beginning of the Acheulean and persisted into the Mousterian. It is therefore not useful as an indicator of chronology (in order for it to be considered as a marker it has to be accompanied by other complementary and independent archaeological data). The hand axes arising from this methodology have a more classical profile with either a more symmetrical almond or oval shape and with a lower proportion of the cortex of the original core. It is not always the case that the retouching had the objective of reducing an edge&#x27;s irregularities or deformities. In fact, it has been shown that in some cases the retouching was carried out to sharpen an edge that had been blunted by use or a point that had deteriorated.

===Soft hammer finish===
Some hand axes were formed with a hard hammer and finished with a soft hammer. Blows that result in deep conchoidal fractures (the first phase of manufacture) can be distinguished from features resulting from sharpening with a soft hammer. The latter leaves shallower, more distended, broader scars, sometimes with small, multiple shock waves. However, marks left by a small, hard hammer can leave similar marks to a soft hammer.

Soft hammer finished pieces are usually balanced and symmetrical, and can be relatively smooth. Soft hammer works first appeared in the Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings to be used as a estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for less raw material.

===Soft hammer only===

Hand axes made using only a soft hammer are much less common. In most cases at least initial work was done with a hard hammer, before subsequent flaking with a soft hammer erased all vestiges of that work. A soft hammer is not suitable for all types of percussion platform and it cannot be used on certain types of raw material. It is, therefore, necessary to start with a hard hammer or with a flake as a core as its edge will be fragile (flat, smooth pebbles are also useful). This means that although it was possible to manufacture a hand axe using a soft hammer, it is reasonable to suppose that a hard hammer was used to prepare a &quot;blank&quot; followed by one or more phases of retouching to finish the piece. However, the degree of separation between the phases is not certain, as the work could have been carried out in one operation.

Working with a soft hammer allows a knapper greater control of the knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, allowing the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges that will increase the tool&#x27;s working life. Hand axes made with a soft hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth so that it is difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular biconvex cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the Micoquien or the Mousterian. Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.

Hand axes were created to be tools and as such they wore out, deteriorated and/or broke during use. Relics have suffered dramatic changes throughout their useful lives. It is common to find edges that have been sharpened, points that have been reconstructed and profiles that have been deformed by reworking in order to extend the piece&#x27;s useful lifetime. Some tools were recycled later, leading Bordes to note that hand axes &quot;are sometimes found in the Upper Palaeolithic. Their presence, which is quite normal in the Perigordian I, is often due, in other levels, to the collection of Mousterian or Acheulean tools.&quot;

==Morphology==

Hand axes have traditionally been oriented with their narrowest part upwards (presupposing that this would have been the most active part, which is not unreasonable given the many hand axes that have unworked bases). The following typological conventions are used to facilitate communication. The axis of symmetry that divides a biface in two is called the &quot;morphological axis.&quot; The &quot;main face&quot; is usually the most regular and better worked face. The &quot;base&quot; (not the &quot;heel&quot;) is the bottom of the hand axe.

*Terminal zone—the narrowest end, opposite the base. Its most common shape is pointed, more or less acute or oval. Some hand axes have terminal ends that are rounded or polygonal (i.e. not pointed) while others have terminal ends that are transversal to the axis, called cleaver or spatulate.
*Proximal end (base)—opposite the terminal end (usually broader and thicker), it can be described as either &quot;reserved&quot; (partially or totally worked, but not cut); or &quot;cut&quot;, with a rounded (polygonal), flat or pointed end.
*Edges—convex, rectilinear or concave, and more or less even. Edges on some specimens are denticulate—scalloped—or notched. Some specimens have unsharpened edges. The profile of a hand axe&#x27;s worked edges can be regular without pronounced rectilinear deviations (the edge is gently curved in the form of an S) or an edge may be more sinuous and wave-formed with pronounced curves or deviations in the edge&#x27;s profile. On some specimens only selected areas have been formed into a working edge.
*Cross section—the horizontal cross-section taken at some distance from the base. It is possible to discern retouching or rebuilding in deteriorated parts of the edges. The following types of cross section are commonly seen: triangular (sub-triangular and backed triangular), rhombic (rhomboidal and backed rhomboidal), trapezium (trapezoid and backed trapezoidal), pentagon (pentagonal and backed pentagonal), polygonal, biconvex or lenticular (sub lenticular).
*Profile—By definition, hand axes have a roughly balanced outline, with a morphological axis that also serves as an axis of bilateral symmetry and a plane that serves as an axis of bifacial symmetry. Not all hand axes are perfectly symmetrical. Symmetry was achieved only after millennia of development. Symmetry may not make tools more useful. Hand axes were used in a variety of heavy physical tasks. They deteriorated, wore out and broke and were often repaired with retouching of their edges, recovery of their points or complete reworking. The majority of discovered pieces are remains, pieces that have been discarded after a long life as tools, during which they often were damaged and/or adapted for specialized tasks. Such pieces may have lost whatever symmetry they initially had. Hand axe profiles can be classified into the following categories:
===Dimensions and ratios===
Hand axe measurements use the morphological axis as a reference and for orientation. In addition to length, width, depth, specialists have proposed a wide range of other physical quantities. The most common were proposed by Bordes and Balout:

*Maximum length (L)
*Maximum width (m)
*Maximum depth (e)
*Distance from the base to the zone with the maximum width (a)
*Width 3/4 of the way along the piece (o)

A and o can be used to delineate the contour&#x27;s cross section and to measure the angles of the edges (provided this is not an area covered in the stone&#x27;s original cortex). These angular measurements for the edges are made using a goniometer.

Edge length, weight and the length of the chord described by the edges (if the piece has a transverse terminal bezel) can be measured. These measurements allow morphological and technical ratios to be established (for example, the relationship between the weight and the length of the cutting edges, or the relationship between the hammer used to form the piece and the angle obtained etc.).

The most commonly used coefficients were established by Bordes for the morphological-mathematical classification of what he called &quot;classic bifaces&quot; (Balout proposed other, similar indices):

&lt;3.75&lt;/math&gt;
|&quot;Oval bifaces&quot;||style&quot;text-align:center&quot;|formula_1

|Elongation index—separates common bifaces from the &quot;short&quot; (and, occasionally, from the &quot;elongated&quot;). For example, within the family of &quot;Oval bifaces&quot; the index distinguishes discoidal bifaces from other types; in the &quot;Almond-shaped bifaces&quot; it identifies lanceolate or micoquien bifaces. The index is calculated using L/m. Thresholds:
&lt;1.3&lt;/math&gt;
|&quot;Common bifaces&quot;||style&quot;text-align:center&quot;|formula_2
|&quot;Elongated bifaces&quot;||style&quot;text-align:center&quot;|formula_3

|Cross-sectional/planar index—divides the &quot;thick&quot; bifaces from the &quot;flat&quot; ones and is used only on certain types. In the &quot;Almond-shaped bifaces&quot; (along with the elongation index) it distinguishes the amygdaloid bifaces (thick) from the cordiform bifaces (flat). The index is calculated using m/e. Thresholds:
&lt;2.35&lt;/math&gt;
|&quot;Flat bifaces&quot;||style&quot;text-align:center&quot;|formula_4

|Other indexes apply to the other types of bifaces (partial bifaces, bifaces with an unworked base, or cleaver, spatulate, Abbevillean, nucleiform, etc.).}}

==Bordes hand axe typology==

The following guide is strongly influenced by the possibly outdated and basically morphological &quot;Bordes method&quot; classification system. This classification is particularly applicable to &quot;classic hand axes&quot;, those that can be defined and catalogued by measuring dimensions and mathematical ratios, while disregarding nearly all subjective criteria. &quot;Distinguishing between different types of hand axes is not always easy. There is often no room for doubts, however, there are a number of cases where the difficulty is real.&quot; In the majority of cases, this system agrees with previously established categories (although slightly redefining them). Balout made a similar attempt at categorization.
===Non-classic specimens===
Many specimens defeat objective classification. Bordes created a group he called &quot;non-classic bifaces&quot; to which mathematical indexes do not apply.

===Tools sometimes categorized as bifaces===
Hand axes constitute an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They are particularly important in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites). Hand axes, chopping tools and trihedral picks are considered &quot;core&quot; utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer to flake tools as &quot;micro industry&quot;, as opposed to the more general size referred to as &quot;macro industry&quot;, which includes hand axes and cleavers. However, some scrapers are as big as hand axes.

*The most elaborated chopping tools and partial hand axes are linked and it is often difficult to distinguish between them. The concept of chopping tools is based on their lack of formal standardization (which is typical of hand axes) and includes the possibility that the pieces are shallow cores, which is unthinkable for the bifaces (except the nucleiforms).
*While hand axes and cleavers occasionally served for similar tasks, their design is fundamentally different.
*Trihedral picks are no longer considered a specialized type of hand axe.

Another group of tools commonly associated with hand axes is the &quot;biface leafpoint tools&quot; from the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic in the Old World. The difference between the two types is based on the latter&#x27;s fine, light finishing with a soft hammer and in a morphology that suggests a specific function, possibly as the point of a projectile or a knife. Representatives of these tools include well known examples from the specialized literature:
*The biface leafpoint tools of central Europe are called (). They are projectile points belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic with a leaf-shaped form. They are often dual pointed and flat, making them similar to Solutrean laurel leaf blades. It is possible to distinguish the two only from their archaeological context. survived in some Upper Palaeolithic cultures. The pieces from the eastern European Szeletien culture (both and Micoquian bifaces) could be the link that connects the tradition of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic bifacial objects with those from the Upper Palaeolithic and beyond.
*Hand axes found in Africa come from both the Aterian culture of North Africa and the Stillbay culture from East Africa. Both these cases relate to Mousterian cultures, although they are relatively late and have their own style, at the end of the so-called African &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot;. In both cases a variety of objects are found, triangular, oval and other leaf-point. Hand axes and unifaces also came from other cultures.

==Importance==
The hand axe helped establish that early humans were capable of constructing relatively sophisticated tools that also reflected a sense of aesthetics. The 19th century publications of Frere, and more importantly of Boucher de Perthes, in France, described pieces that were balanced, symmetrical and crafted with a formal purity. Vilanova i Piera published similar works in Spain. This work was continued by Pérez de Barradas and del Prado at the start of the 20th century.


As Leroi-Gourhan explained, it is important to ask what was understood of art at the time, considering the psychologies of non-modern humans. Archaeological records documenting rapid progress towards symmetry and balance surprised Leroi-Gourha. He felt that he could recognize beauty in early prehistoric tools made during the Acheulean:
Many authors who comment on the Westfield aspect of hand axes refer only to exceptional pieces. The majority of hand axes tended to symmetry, but lack artistic appeal. Generally, only the most striking pieces are considered, mainly 19th or early 20th century collections. At that time a lack of knowledge regarding prehistoric technology prevented a recognition of human actions in these objects. Other collections were made by aficionados, whose interests were not scientific, so that they collected only objects they considered to be outstanding, abandoning humbler elements that were sometimes necessary to interpret an archaeological site. Exceptions include sites methodically studied by experts where magnificently carved, abundant hand axes caused archaeologists to express admiration for the artists:


The discovery in 1998 of an oval hand axe of excellent workmanship in the Sima de los Huesos in the Atapuerca Mountains mixed in with the fossil remains of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; reignited this controversy. Given that this is the only lithic remnant from this section of the site (possibly a burial ground), combined with the piece&#x27;s qualities led it to receive special treatment, it was even baptized Excalibur and it became a &quot;star item&quot;. Interest in the symbolic meaning of this example in particular, and hand axes in general, has multiplied in recent years, feeding both scientific and more general debate and literature.

Basch offered this counterargument:
Paradoxically, within the wide range of Acheulean objects, hand axes are one of the simplest tools. They do not require as much planning as other types of object, generally made from flakes, that are less striking but more sophisticated.

Archaeologists have evidence of hand axes that are 1.2 million years old in Melka Kunturé (Ethiopia), but the oldest, from Konso-Gardula, could be 1.9 million years old: Although it is now known that they are the heritage of a number of human species, with &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; the earliest, up until 1954 no solid evidence indicated who had fabricated hand axes: in that year, in Ternifine, Algeria, Arambourg discovered remains that he called &quot;Atlanthropus&quot;, along with some hand axes. All the species associated with hand axes (from &quot;H. ergaster&quot; to H. &quot;neanderthalensis&quot;) show an advanced intelligence that in some cases is accompanied by modern features such as a relatively sophisticated technology, systems to protect against inclement weather (huts, control of fire, clothing), and certain signs of spiritual awareness (early indications of art such as adorning the body, carving of bones, ritual treatment of bodies, articulated language).

<doc id="320340" wikidata="Q1760326" url="?curid=320340" title="Needle and syringe programmes">
<text>A needle and syringe programme (NSP), also known as needle exchange program (NEP), is a social service that allows injection drug users (IDUs) to obtain clean and unused hypodermic needles and associated paraphernalia at little or no cost. It is based on the philosophy of harm reduction that attempts to reduce the risk factors for blood-borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.

== History==
Needle-exchange programmes can be traced back to informal activities undertaken during the 1970s. The idea is likely to have been rediscovered in multiple locations. The first government-approved initiative (Netherlands) was undertaken in the early to mid-1980s, followed closely by initiatives in the United Kingdom and Australia by 1986. While the initial programme was motivated by an outbreak of hepatitis B, the AIDS pandemic motivated the rapid adoption of these programmes around the world.

== Operation ==
Needle and syringe programs operate differently in different parts of the world; the first NSPs in Europe and Australia gave out sterile equipment to drug users, having begun in the context of the early AIDS epidemic. The United States took a far more reluctant approach, typically requiring IDUs to already have used needles to exchange for sterile ones - this &quot;one-for-one&quot; system is where the same number of syringes must be returned.

According to Santa Cruz County, California, exchange staff interviewed by &quot;Santa Cruz Local&quot; in 2019, it is a common practice not to count the number of exchanged needles exactly, but rather to estimate the number based on a container&#x27;s volume. Holyoke, Massachusetts, also uses the volume system. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for South Asia suggests visual estimation or asking the client how many they brought back. The volume-based method left potential for gaming the system and an exchange agency in Vancouver devoted significant effort to game the system.

Some, such as the Columbus Public Health in Ohio weigh the returned sharps rather than counting.

The practices and policies vary between needle and syringe program sites. In addition to exchange, there is a model called &quot;needs-based&quot; where the syringes are handed out without requiring any to be returned.

According to a report published in 1994, Montreal&#x27;s CACTUS exchange which has a policy of one-for-one, plus one needle with a limit of 15 had a return rate of 75-80% between 1991 and 1993.

An exchange in Boulder, Colorado, implemented a one-for-one with four starter needles and reported an exchange rate of 89.1% in 1992.

In the United States, where the one-for-one system still dominates, some 25% of injecting drug users are living positive with HIV; in Australia, which hands out equipment for free to anyone needing it (only charging a small fee for some more expensive equipment, like wheel filters and higher-quality tourniquets), only 1% of the IDU population is HIV-positive as of 2015, compared to over 20% in the late 1980s when NSP programs began to spread nationally and became accessible to most of the population.

== International experience ==
Programs providing sterile needles and syringes currently operate in 87 countries around the world. IA comprehensive 2004 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found a &quot;compelling case that NSPs substantially and cost effectively reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs and do so without evidence of exacerbating injecting drug use at either the individual or societal level.&quot; WHO&#x27;s findings have also been supported by the American Medical Association (AMA), which in 2000 adopted a position strongly supporting NSPs when combined with addiction counseling.

=== Australia ===
The Melbourne, Australia, inner-city suburbs of Richmond, and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated. The Burnet Institute research organisation completed the 2013 &#x27;North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study&#x27; in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing &quot;widespread, frequent and highly visible&quot; nature of illicit drug use in the areas. Between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the surrounding City of Yarra, an average of 1,550 syringes per month was collected from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Paul Dietze stated, &quot;We have tried different measures and the problem persists, so it&#x27;s time to change our approach&quot;.

On 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated that it recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area&#x27;s drug culture continued to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The institute&#x27;s research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths, and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken into syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded equipment.

A study commissioned by the Australian Government revealed that for every A$1 invested in NSPs in Australia, $4 was saved in direct healthcare costs, and if productivity and economic benefits are included, the programs returned a staggering $27 for every $1 invested. The study notes that over a longer time horizon than that considered (10 years) the cost-benefit ratio grows even further. In terms of infections averted and lives saved, the study finds that, between 2000 and 2009, 32,000 HIV infections and 96,667 hepatitis C infections were averted, and approximately 140,000 disability-adjusted life years were gained.

=== United Kingdom ===
From the 1980s, Maggie Telfer from the Bristol Drugs Project advocated for needle exchanges to be established in the United Kingdom. The British public body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), introduced a recommendation in April 2014 due to an increase in the number of young people who inject steroids at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services were not advised for people under 18, but the organisation&#x27;s director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a &quot;completely different group&quot; of people were presenting at programmes. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for &quot;rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users&quot;, and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18—a first for NICE—following reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles.

=== United States ===
The first program in the United States to be operated at public expenses was established in Tacoma, Washington in November 1988. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health confirm that needle exchange is an effective strategy for the prevention of HIV. The NIH estimated in 2002 that in the United States, 15–20% of injection drug users have HIV and at least 70% have hepatitis C. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports one-fifth of all new HIV infections and the vast majority of hepatitis C infections are the result of injection drug use. United States Department of Health and Human Services reports 7%, or 2,400 cases of HIV infections in 2018 were among drug users.

Portland, Oregon, was the first city in nation to expend public funds on a NSP which opened in 1989. It is also one of the longest running programme in the country. Despite the word &quot;exchange&quot; in the programme name, the Portland needle exchange operated by Multnomah County hands out syringes to addicts who do not present any to exchange. The exchange programme reports 70% of their users are transients who experience &quot;homelessness or unstable housing&quot; It was reported that during the fiscal year 2015–2016, the county dispensed 2,478,362 syringes and received 2,394,460, a shortage of 83,902 needles. In 2016, it was reported that the Cleveland needle exchange program sees &quot;mostly white suburban kids ages 18 to 25&quot;.

==== San Francisco ====
Since the full sanction of syringe exchange programs (SEP) by then-Mayor Frank Jordan in 1993, the San Francisco Department of Public Health has been responsible for the management of syringe access and the proposed disposal of these devices in the city. This sanction, which was originally executed as a state of emergency to address the HIV epidemic, allowed SEPs to provide sterile syringes, take back used devices, and operate as a service for health education to support individuals struggling with substance use disorders. Since then, it was approximated that from July 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, only 1,672,000 out of the 3,030,000 distributed needles (60%) were returned to the designated sites. In April 2018, acting Mayor Mark Farrell allocated $750,000 towards the removal of abandoned needles littering the streets of San Francisco.

==== General characteristics ====
As of 2011, at least 221 programmes operated in the US. Most (91%) were legally authorized to operate; 38.2% were managed by their local health authorities. The CDC reported in 1993 that the most significant expenses for the NSPs is personnel cost, which reports it represents 66% of the budget.

More than 36 million syringes were distributed annually, mostly through large urban programmes operating a stationary site. More generally, US NEPs distribute syringes through a variety of methods including mobile vans, delivery services and backpack/pedestrian routes that include secondary (peer-to-peer) exchange.

==== Funding ====

In the United States, a ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs began in 1988, when republican North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms led Congress to enact a prohibition on the use of federal funds to encourage drug abuse. The ban was briefly lifted in 2009, reinstated in 2010, and partially lifted again in 2015. Currently, federal funds can still not be used for the purchase of needles and syringes or other injecting paraphernalia by needle exchange programs, though can be used for training and other program support in the case of a declared public health emergency. In the time between 2010 and 2011 when no ban was in place, at least three programmes were able to obtain federal funds and two-thirds reported planning to pursue such funding. A 1997 study estimated that while the funding ban was in effect, it &quot;may have led to HIV infection among thousands of IDUs, their sexual partners, and their children.&quot; US NEPs continue to be funded through a mixture of state and local government funds, supplemented by private donations. The funding ban was effectively lifted for every aspect of the exchanges except the needles themselves in the omnibus spending bill passed in December 2015 and signed by President Obama. This change was first suggested by Kentucky Republicans Hal Rogers and Mitch McConnell, according to their spokespeople.

==== Legal aspects ====
Many states criminalized needle possession without a prescription, arresting people as they left underground needle exchange efforts. In some jurisdictions, such as New York, needle exchange activists challenged the laws in court, with judges ruling that their actions were justified by a &quot;necessity defense&quot; which permits breaking of a law to prevent an imminent harm. In other jurisdictions where syringe possession without a prescription remained illegal, physician-based prescription programmes have shown promise. Epidemiological research demonstrating that syringe access programmes are both effective and cost-effective helped to change state and local NEP-operation laws, as well as the status of syringe possession more broadly. For example, between 1989 and 1992, three exchanges in New York City tagged syringes to help demonstrate rates of return prior to the legalization of the approach.

By 2012, legal syringe exchange programmes existed in at least 35 states. In some settings, syringe possession and purchase is decriminalized, while in others, authorized NEP clients are exempt from certain drug paraphernalia laws. However, despite the legal changes, gaps between the formal law and environment mean that many programmes continue to face law enforcement interference and covert programmes continue to exist within the U.S.

Colorado allows covert syringe exchange programmes to operate. Current Colorado laws leave room for interpretation over the requirement of a prescription to purchase syringes. Based on such laws, the majority of pharmacies do not sell syringes without a prescription and police arrest people who possess syringes without a prescription. Boulder County health department reports between January 2012 and March 2012, the group received over 45,000 dirty needles and distributed around 45,200 sterile syringes.

As of 2017, NSPs are illegal in 15 states. NSPs are prohibited by local regulations in cities in Orange County, California, even though it is not disallowed by state law in California.

== Law enforcement ==

=== Conflict with law enforcement ===
Removal of legal barriers to the operation of NEPs and other syringe access initiatives has been identified as an important part of a comprehensive approach to reducing HIV transmission among IDUs. Legal barriers include both &quot;law on the books&quot; and &quot;law on the streets&quot;, i.e., the actual practices of law enforcement officers, which may or may not reflect relevant law. Changes in syringe and drug control policy can be ineffective in reducing such barriers if police continue to treat syringe possession as a crime or participation in NEP as evidence of criminal activity.

Although most US NEPs operate legally, many report some form of police interference. In a 2009 national survey of 111 US NEP managers, 43% reported at least monthly client harassment, 31% at least monthly unauthorized confiscation of clients&#x27; syringes, 12% at least monthly client arrest en route to or from NEP and 26% uninvited police appearances at program sites at least every six months. In multivariate modeling, legal status of the program (operating legally vs illegally) and jurisdiction&#x27;s syringe regulation environment were not associated with frequency of police interference.

A detailed 2011 analysis of NEP client experiences in Los Angeles suggested that as many as 7% of clients report negative encounters with security officers in any given month. Given that syringes are not prohibited in the jurisdiction and their confiscation can only occur as part of an otherwise authorized arrest, almost 40% of those who reported syringe confiscation were not arrested. This raises concerns about extrajudicial confiscation of personal property. Approximately 25% of the encounters detailed by respondents involved private security personnel, rather than local police.

Similar findings have emerged internationally. For example, despite instituting laws protecting syringe access and possession and adopting NEPs, IDUs and sex workers in Mexico&#x27;s Northern Border regions report frequent syringe confiscation by law enforcement personnel. In this region as well as elsewhere, reports of syringe confiscation are correlated with increases in risky behaviors, such as groin injecting, public injection and utilization of pharmacies. These practices translate to risk for HIV and other blood-borne diseases.

=== Racial gradient ===
NEPs serving predominantly IDUs of color may be almost four times more likely to report frequent client arrest en route to or from the program and almost four times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation. A 2005 study in Philadelphia found that African-Americans accessing the city&#x27;s legally operated exchange decreased at more than twice the rate of white individuals after the initiation of a police anti-drug operation. These and other findings illustrate a possible mechanism by which racial disparities in law enforcement can translate into disparities in HIV transmission. The majority (56%) of respondents reported not documenting adverse police events; those who did were 2.92 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation. These findings suggest that systematic surveillance and interventions are needed to address police interference.

=== Causes ===
Police interference with legal NEP operations may be partially explained by training defects. A study of police officers in an urban police department four years after the decriminalization of syringe purchase and possession in the US state of Rhode Island suggested that up to a third of police officers were not aware that the law had changed. This knowledge gap parallels other areas of public health law, underscoring pervasive gaps in dissemination.

Even police officers with accurate knowledge of the law, however, reported intention to confiscate syringes from drug users as a way to address problematic substance use. Police also reported anxiety about accidental needle sticks and acquiring communicable diseases from IDUs, but were not trained or equipped to deal with this occupational risk; this anxiety was intertwined with negative attitudes towards syringe access initiatives.

=== Training and interventions to address law enforcement barriers ===
US NEPs have successfully trained police, especially when framed as addressing police occupational safety and human resources concerns. Preliminary evidence also suggests that training can shift police knowledge and attitudes regarding NEPs specifically and public health-based approaches towards problematic drug use in general.

According to a 2011 survey, 20% of US NEPs reported training police during the previous year. Covered topics included the public health rationale behind NEPs (71%), police occupational health (67%), needle stick injury (62%), NEPs&#x27; legal status (57%), and harm reduction philosophy (67%). On average, training was seen as moderately effective, but only four programmes reported conducting any formal evaluation. Assistance with training police was identified by 72% of respondents as the key to improving police relations.

== Advocacy ==

Organizations ranging from the NIH, CDC, the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the World Health Organization and many others endorsed low-threshold programmes including needle exchange.

Needle exchange programmes have faced opposition on both political and moral grounds. Advocacy groups including the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA), Drug Watch International, The Heritage Foundation, Drug Free Australia, and so forth and religious organizations such as the Catholic Church.

In the United States NEP programmes have proliferated, despite lack of public acceptance. Internationally, needle exchange is widely accepted.

== Research ==
=== Disease transmission ===
Two 2010 &#x27;reviews of reviews&#x27; by a team originally led by Norah Palmateer that examined systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV, and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported risky injecting behaviour. In a comment Palmateer warned politicians not to use her team&#x27;s review of reviews as a justification to close existing programmes or to hinder the introduction of new needle-exchange schemes. The weak evidence on the programmes&#x27; disease prevention effectiveness is due to inherent design limitations of the reviewed primary studies and should not be interpreted as the programmes lacking preventive effects.

The second of the Palmateer team&#x27;s &#x27;review of reviews&#x27; scrutinised 10 previous formal reviews of needle exchange studies, and after critical appraisal only four reviews were considered rigorous enough to meet the inclusion criteria. Those were done by the teams of Gibson (2001), Wodak and Cooney (2004), Tilson (2007) and Käll (2007). The Palmateer team judged that their conclusion in favour of NSP effectiveness was not consistent with the results from the HIV studies they reviewed.

The Wodak and Cooney review had, from 11 studies of what they determined as demonstrating acceptable rigour, found 6 that were positive regarding the effectiveness of NSPs in preventing HIV, 3 that were negative and 2 inconclusive. However a review by Käll &quot;et al.&quot; disagreed with the Wodak and Cooney review, reclassifying the studies on NSP effectiveness to 3 positive, 3 negative and 5 inconclusive. The US Institute of Medicine evaluated the conflicting evidence of both Drs Wodak and Käll in their Geneva session and concluded that although multicomponent HIV prevention programmes that include needle and syringe exchange reduced intermediate HIV risk behavior, evidence regarding the effect of needle and syringe exchange alone on HIV incidence was limited and inconclusive, given &quot;myriad design and methodological issues noted in the majority of studies.&quot; Four studies that associated needle exchange with reduced HIV prevalence failed to establish a causal link, because they were designed as population studies rather than assessing individuals.

NEPs successfully serve as one component of HIV prevention strategies. Multi-component HIV prevention programmes that include NSE reduce drug-related HIV risk behaviors and enhance the impact of harm reduction services.

Tilson (2007) concluded that only comprehensive packages of services in multi-component prevention programmes can be effective in reducing drug-related HIV risks. In such packages, it is unclear what the relative contribution of needle exchange may be to reductions in risk behavior and HIV incidence.

Multiple examples can be cited showing the relative ineffectiveness of needle exchange programmes alone in stopping the spread of blood-borne disease. Many needle exchange programmes do not make any serious effort to treat drug addiction. For example, David Noffs of the Life Education Center wrote, &quot;I have visited sites around Chicago where people who request info on quitting their habit are given a single sheet on how to go cold turkey—hardly effective treatment or counseling.&quot;

A 2013 systematic review found support for the use of NEPs to prevent and treat HIV and HCV infection. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence that NEPs were effective in reducing HIV transmission among injection drug users, but that other harm reduction programmes have probably also contributed to the decrease in HIV incidence. NEPs appear to be as effective in low- and middle-income countries as in high-income ones.

=== Worker training ===
Lemon and Shah presented a 2013 paper at the International Congress of Psychiatrists that highlighted lack of training for needle exchange workers and also showed the workers performing a range of tasks beyond contractual obligations, for which they had little support or training. It also showed how needle exchange workers were a common first contact for distressed drug users. Perhaps the most concerning finding was that workers were not legally allowed to provide Naloxone should it be needed.

=== Drug use ===
According to a 2022 study by Vanderbilt University economist Analisa Packham, syringe exchange programs reduce HIV rates by 18.2 percent but lead to greater drug use. Syringe exchange programmes increased drug-related mortality rates by 11.7 percent and opioid-related mortality rates by 21.6 percent.

== Arguments for and against ==

=== Needle disposal ===
==== NSPs do not increase litter: broad arguments ====
Activist groups claim there is no way to ensure SEP users will be properly disposed of. Peer reviewed studies suggest that there are less improperly disposed of syringes in cities with needle exchange programs than in cities without. Other studies of similar design find that syringe exchange program drop boxes were associated with an overall decrease of improper syringe disposal (over 98% decrease) and going further from said syringe exchange sites increases the amount of improperly disposed needles. Other ethnographic studies find evidence that criminal related drug possession laws further serve to increase improperly disposed of needles, and decreasing the severity of possession laws may positively impact proper syringe disposal, this corroborates the CDC&#x27;s own guidelines on syringe disposal, which claim &quot;Studies have found that syringe litter is more likely in areas without SSPs&quot;.

==== NSPs do increase litter: broad arguments ====
On the other hand, there is data to suggest SEPs do increase improper syringe disposal. Opposition groups contribute their own proof through photographic evidence of increased needle litter, additionally, opponents argue that programs which do not mandate a 1:1 needle exchange encourage the more convenient improper discarding of needles when the programs are not open or are not accepting needle returns. Additionally, many programs allow for unlimited access to needles, which opponents argue increases litter to a much higher degree on the basis of increasing total needles in circulation. Portland residents in areas where syringe acquisition is unlimited claim to be &quot;drowning in needles&quot; and picking up upwards of 100 per week. Opposition groups also argue government action in increasing the amount of syringe disposal boxes is slow. 
* NSPs that strictly adhere to one-for-one policy and do not furnish starter syringes/needles do not increase the number of them in circulation.
* The few studies that specifically evaluated the effects of NEPs produced &quot;modest&quot; evidence of no impact on improper needle discards and injection frequency and &quot;weak&quot; evidence on lack of impact on numbers of drug users, high-risk user networks and crime trends.
* Some NSPs hands outs needles without an expectation of used syringes being returned. One NSP in Portland, Oregon, hands out syringes without question. Neighbors near the NSP are routinely finding discarded syringes and the neighborhood organization to which they are a part of, the University Park park neighborhood association, desires the needle handout operation to stop. A local resident visited a NSP in Chico, California, and she was handed 100 syringes without question. The City Council in Chico is discussing banning the operation.
* A 2003 Australian bi-partisan Federal Parliamentary inquiry published recommendations, registering concern about the lack of accountability of Australia&#x27;s needle exchanges, and lack of a national program to track needle stick injuries. Community concern about discarded needles and needle stick injury led Australia to allocate $17.5 million in 2003/4 to investigating retractable technology for syringes.

=== Treatment program enrollment ===
* IDUs risk multiple health problems from non-sterile injecting practices, drug complications and associated lifestyle choices. Unrelated health problems such as diabetes may be neglected because of drug dependence. IDUs are typically reluctant to use conventional health services. Such reluctance/neglect implies poorer health and increased use of emergency services, creating added costs. Harm reduction based health care centres, also known as &quot;targeted health care outlet&quot; or &quot;low-threshold health care outlet&quot; for IDUs have been established to address this issue.
* NSP staff facilitate connections among people who use drugs and medical facilities, thereby exposing them to voluntary physical, psychological and emotional treatment programmes.
* Social services for addicts can be organized around needle exchanges, increasing their accessibility.

=== Cost effectiveness ===
As of 2011, CDC estimated that every HIV infection prevented through a needle exchange program saves an estimated US$178,000+. Separately it reported an overall 30 percent or more reduction in HIV cases among IDUs.

=== Proponents ===
Proponents of harm reduction argue that the provision of a needle exchange provides a social benefit in reducing health costs and also provides a safe means to dispose of used syringes. For example, in the United Kingdom, proponents of SEPs assert that, along with other programmes, they have reduced the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users. These supposed benefits have led to an expansion of these programmes in most jurisdictions that have introduced them, increasing geographical coverage and operating hours. Vending machines that automatically dispense injecting equipment have been successfully introduced.

Other promoted benefits of these programmes include providing a first point of contact for formal drug treatment, access to health and counselling service referrals, the provision of up-to-date information about safe injecting practices, access to contraception and sexual health services and providing a means for data collection from users about their behaviour and/or drug use patterns. SEP outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. These are known as &#x27;targeted primary health care outlets&#x27;, because they primarily target people who inject drugs and/or &#x27;low-threshold health care outlets&#x27;, because they reduce common barriers to health care from the conventional health care outlets. Clients frequently visit SEP outlets for help accessing sterile injecting equipment. These visits are used opportunistically to offer other health care services.

A clinical trial of needle exchange found that needle exchange did not cause an increase in drug injection.

=== California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) ===
Within California, those opposed to syringe exchange programs have frequently invoked the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) as a means to bar syringe exchange programs from operating, citing the environmental impact of improper syringe disposals. Most notably SEP opposition within Santa Cruz, and Orange County—whose only syringe exchange program The Orange County Needle Exchange Program (OCNEP) was blocked from operating in October, 2019 by an Orange County lawsuit which charged the program with creating hazardous conditions and litter for residents. The OCNEP contests that public needle litter still exists after the shutdown of their program.

Legislation in California signed by governor Gavin Newsom in 2021, AB-1344, aimed to block the use of CEQA to challenge SEPs. The provision states that &quot;Needle and syringe exchange services application submissions, authorizations, and operations performed pursuant to this chapter shall be exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act, Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code.&quot;

The provision was passed on the basis of curtailing the opioid epidemic. There is no part of the bill which explicitly addresses the environmental concerns of the plaintiffs.

=== Scope ===
In a 1993 mortality study among 415 injection drug users in the Philadelphia area, over four years, 28 died: 5 from HIV-related causes; 7 from overdose, 5 from homicide, 4 from heart disease, 3 from renal failure, 2 from liver disease, 1 from suicide and 1 from cancer.

=== Community issues ===
* NSP effectiveness studies usually focused on addict health effects; the United States National District Attorneys Association argues that they neglect effects on the broader community.
* NSPs may concentrate drug activity into communities in which they operate. Only a small number of short-term studies considered whether NSPs have such effects. To the extent that this happens, they may negatively affect property values, increase localized crime rates and damage broader perceptions about the host community. In 1987 in the Platzspitz park in Zürich &quot;...authorities chose to allow illegal drug use and sales at the park, in an effort to contain Zürich&#x27;s growing drug problem. Police were not allowed to enter the park or make arrests. Clean needles were given out to addicts as part of the Zürich Intervention Pilot Project, or ZIPP-AIDS program. However, lack of control over what went on in the park caused a multitude of problems. Drug dealers and users arrived from all over Europe, and crime became rampant as dealers fought for control and addicts (who numbered up to 20,000) stole to support their habit.&quot;
* In Australia, which is considered a leading proponent of harm reduction, a survey showed that one-third of the public believed that NSPs encouraged drug use, and 20% believed that NSPs dispensed drugs.

=== Diversion ===
NPR interviewed a syringe exchange program Prevention Point Philadelphia in Philadelphia, United States, and some of its clients. The program Prevention Point allows anyone presenting syringes to exchange for the same quantity without limitation and this has led to drug addicts selling clean syringes to other drug addicts to make drug money. Some drug dealers use the needle exchange to obtain a supply of large quantities of needles to sell or give to their drug buyers.

Some participants interviewed by a &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in February 2000 revealed that they sell some of the new syringes obtained from the exchange in order to make drug money and did not always stop needle sharing among drug addicts.

<text>Parliamentary immunity, also known as legislative immunity, is a system in which politicians or other political leaders are granted full immunity from legal prosecution, both civil prosecution and criminal prosecution, in the course of the execution of their official duties.

Advocates of parliamentary immunity suggest the doctrine is necessary to keep a check on unauthorised use of power of the judiciary, to maintain judicial accountability, and to promote the health of democratic institutions.

==Westminster system countries==

Legislators in countries using the Westminster system, such as the United Kingdom, are protected from civil action and criminal law for slander and libel by parliamentary immunity whilst they are in the House. This protection is part of the privileges afforded the Houses of Parliament under parliamentary privileges. Parliamentary immunity from criminal prosecution is not enjoyed by Members of Parliament under the Westminster system. This lack of criminal immunity is derived from the key tenet of the British Constitution that all are equal before the law.

==Brazil==
The 1988 Brazilian constitution grants parliamentary immunity to members of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Unlike other countries, Brazilian parliamentary immunity is also extended to crimes committed outside a parliamentarian&#x27;s official duties (murder, theft, etc.). This does not apply for crimes committed before the member of parliament takes office. Members of parliament can be arrested only for crimes if caught at the time of the criminal act in flagrante for a crime with no possibility of bail. These arrests can be overruled by a floor vote of the particular parliament chamber that parliamentarian belongs to.

Criminal proceedings may be suspended for crimes committed only after a parliamentarian begins his term of office, and requests for suspensions need to be approved by majority of members of Parliament. Members of the National Congress as well as other high level politicians are prosecuted and judged exclusively by the Supreme Court, as opposed to the lower courts.

As of 2007, no Brazilian politician has ever been convicted by the Supreme Federal Tribunal of any crime since parliamentary immunity was instituted in 1988.

After the Mensalão scandal in 2005, the Supreme Federal Tribunal surprised many when, on August 24, 2007, it accepted the indictments of 40 individuals, most of which are former or current federal deputies, all of which were allies of Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

==France==

Members of the Parliament of France enjoy &quot;irresponsibility&quot; for what they did as parliamentarians, and partial &quot;inviolability&quot; – that is, severe restrictions for the police or justice to arrest or detain them. Both irresponsibility and inviolability are mandated by article 26 of the Constitution of France.

These dispositions are somewhat controversial, following abuse of such privileges.

==Germany==

Article 46 of Germany&#x27;s Constitution states: &quot;At no time may a Member be subjected to court proceedings or disciplinary action or otherwise called to account outside the Bundestag for a vote cast or for any speech or debate in the Bundestag or in any of its committees,&quot; with exceptions made for &quot;defamatory insults.&quot;
It also states that &quot;a Member may not be called to account or arrested for a punishable offence without permission of the Bundestag unless he is apprehended while committing the offence or in the course of the following day.&quot;
Furthermore, the Bundestag may also order that a detainment or prosecution of a member be suspended.

The states of Germany also have similar procedures for their legislative bodies.

==Greece==
Members of the Hellenic Parliament are immune from criminal prosecution, arrest or detention while in office, with the exception of crimes committed &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;. They are also immune from having to provide any information to any authority regarding their legislative functions and deliberations. However, both the Constitution and the Standing Orders allow for the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office to request from Parliament to lift an MP&#x27;s immunity for a particular crime, with MPs deciding through open balloting. Alleged crimes committed by members of the Cabinet (including non-MPs) or the President of the Republic are first investigated by an ad hoc parliamentary committee, with MPs then voting on the committee&#x27;s recommendations. Should parliament determine that there is sufficient evidence for prosecution, an &quot;ad hoc&quot; Special Court is set up.

==Italy==
Parliamentary immunity in Italy was re-instated in 1948 by the Constituent Assembly, to prevent cases such as &quot;Francesco Saverio Nitti, whose house was searched and ransacked by the fascist police in the fall of 1923; Giacomo Matteotti, murdered by fascists June 10, 1924 for his work as a deputy of opposition; Giovanni Amendola, beaten in Montecatini in 1925 and died in Cannes in April 1926; Antonio Gramsci, whose parliamentary mandate was revoked on Nov. 9, 1926 and who was tried in 1928 by a special court for his activities as a Member of Parliament and as a political opponent. The same court had him imprisoned and his correspondence was seized&quot;.

Immunity was limited in 1993, but abuse continues by means of denying authorizations to certain judiciary acts, like wiretapping; therefore, in the final judgment, the Constitutional Court often overturns the decisions of Parliament to protect its members, authorising the activities of the judiciary.

== Portugal ==
Parliamentary immunity in Portugal is provided for in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and aims to protect MPs in the exercise of their duties, guaranteeing them independence and autonomy from possible pressure or reprisals, through a two-tiered immunity:

* Inviolability: Members of Parliament cannot be held responsible for the opinions they express or the votes they cast in the exercise of their duties. This immunity is absolute and permanent, meaning that it applies even after their mandate has ended.
* Procedural immunity: Members of Parliament may not be subjected to arrest, pre-trial detention or any measure depriving them of their liberty without the authorisation of the Assembly of the Republic, except in cases of &quot;flagrante delicto&quot; for a crime punishable by a prison sentence of more than three years.

=== Waiving of Immunity ===
Parliamentary immunity can be waived in certain circumstances, following a specific procedure:

#    Request to Lift Immunity: This can be requested by the Public Ministry or by a judge in the context of legal proceedings, which is addressed President of the Assembly of the Republic, who forwards it to the Ethics Committee.
#    Ethics Committee: The Assembly of the Republic&#x27;s Ethics, Rights and Guarantees Commission analyses the request. The Committee assesses whether the request is legally founded and is not an attempt at political persecution. Upon said analysis the committee draws up an opinion which is then submitted to the plenary of the Assembly.
#    Plenary decision: The plenary of the Assembly of the Republic votes on the opinion of the Ethics Commission. Immunity is only lifted if the majority of deputies present vote in favour. If the plenary approves the lifting of immunity, the MP may be subject to legal proceedings and coercive measures.

=== Exemptions ===
Parliamentary immunity does not prevent a member of parliament from being investigated or the judicial process from going ahead. It only protects the MP from being arrested or detained without the due authorisation of the Assembly of the Republic, except in situations of &quot;flagrante delicto&quot; for serious crimes.

=== Autonomous Regions ===
Parliamentary immunity in the Autonomous Regions of the Azores and Madeira in Portugal follows similar principles to those applied to members of the Assembly of the Republic, but adapted to the context of the regional Legislative Assemblies. This immunity is regulated by the respective Political-Administrative statutes of the Autonomous Regions and by the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic.

==South Korea==
Legislative immunity in South Korea was established in the 1987 Constitution, which ended nearly 30 years of military dictatorship following pro-democracy movements. The Constitution grants lawmakers two types of immunity: immunity from arrest and detention and immunity from criminal and civil liabilities for speeches made during sessions or votes cast in the Assembly.

According to Article 44 of the Constitution, members of the National Assembly cannot be arrested or detained during legislative sessions unless the Assembly approves it or the member is caught in the act of committing a crime (i.e., caught in flagrante delicto). Article 44 was established in response to South Korea’s long history of dictatorial regimes detaining legislators to prevent them from voting in a way that the President might disagree with or to check the President’s powers. 

While Article 44 specifically addresses arrests and detentions, Article 45 immunizes members of the National Assembly against criminal and civil liabilities for opinions officially expressed or for votes cast in the Assembly. However, unlike presidential immunity, which shields the president from criminal charges while in office, legislative immunity does not protect legislators from criminal charges for conducts that fall outside of Article 45, even during legislative sessions. Most notably in 2013, the arrest motion of Assemblyman Lee Seok-kisuspected of plotting with several members of his party to overthrow the government if a war broke out with North Koreawas submitted to the National Assembly. The motion passed, leading to Lee&#x27;s arrest, indictment, trial, and conviction.

==Spain==
In Spain, parliamentarians in the national Congress of Deputies and senators as well as legislators serving in regional administrations and certain members of the Spanish royal family are afforded &quot;, thus becoming &quot; (lit. &#x27;afforded ones&#x27;) and enjoy privileges granted in the Constitution of Spain. These self-regulatory organizations&#x27; membership privileges are reflected in the following parliamentary prerogatives:

* Inviolability: Legislators can not be judicially prosecuted for opinions expressed or votes cast in the exercise of their official duties (Article 71.1 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978). 
*Immunity: Legislators may only be detained in &quot;flagrante delicto&quot;, and so plaintiffs and prosecutors must seek authorisation from the assembly in which the accused is elected before any legal process is initiated (Article 71.2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978). although the final authority rests with the Supreme Court of Spain
* Specific jurisdiction: Parliamentarians can only be judged in the first instance by the Supreme Court, a practice that has been criticised as potentially undermining any right of appeal to a higher court.

Currently, there are 10,000 persons in Spain with parliamentary immunity, and only a fifth of them are politicians.

==Turkey==
Between 26 October 1961 and 12 March 1998 Turkish prosecutors made 2,713 requests to suspend the immunity of 1,151 deputies. Only 29 requests were granted. Six of these were the deputies of the Democracy Party arrested in 1994 because of their openly support for the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) and separatist activities like the one as Leyla Zana wore a napkin in the Kurdish colors red, green, yellow.

In connection with the Ergenekon trials (from 2008), some accused have been selected as parliamentary candidates specifically to give them legal protection via parliamentary immunity.

On 20 May 2016, an amendment to the Constitution has been passed by the Parliament, removing parliamentary immunity. Due to surpassing the two-thirds majority threshold, the amendment was able to pass without a constitutional referendum. In November of the same year, nine members of parliament of the Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) were arrested. On the 4 June 2020 another three Turkish MPs were dismissed from parliament and arrested, two from the HDP and one from the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP).

==Ukraine==
Article 80 of the Ukrainian Constitution states that parliamentary immunity is guaranteed to the peoples&#x27; deputies of Ukraine. The peoples&#x27; deputies of Ukraine do not have legal responsibility for their votes and opinions in parliament and its appendant bodies, except for responsibility for insult or defamation.

==United States==
&quot;Mason&#x27;s Manual&quot; notes, &quot;The courts, by a series of decisions, have explained away almost every essential feature of the privilege from arrest as it once existed...A member of the legislature has no right to physically resist an officer attempting to make an arrest to the extent of assaulting such officer.&quot;

Members of the United States Congress enjoy a similar parliamentary privilege as members of the British Parliament; that is, they cannot be prosecuted for anything they say on the floor of the House or Senate. They also enjoy the right to be present in Congress: that is, they may be in prison or jail the rest of the time, but they have the right to attend congressional sessions, speak on the floor, vote, etc. These rights are specified in the Constitution and have been fairly uncontroversial in U.S. history. Courts have consistently interpreted them very narrowly.

Several state constitutions provided equivalent protections for members of state legislatures.

==Vietnam==
National Assembly deputies and delegates of the People&#x27;s Council are protected from being arrested and prosecuted. National Assembly deputies cannot be dismissed or sacked by the agency, organization or unit where the deputy works. These protections can be revoked by the National Assembly (usually as approval from the Standing Committee) or the People&#x27;s Council (local legislatures), respectively.

<text>Alexander Gerschenkron (; 1 October 1904 – 26 October 1978) was an American economic historian and professor at Harvard University, trained in the German Historical School of economics.

Born into a Jewish family in Odessa, then part of the Russian Empire, now in Ukraine, Gerschenkron fled the country during the Russian Civil War in 1920 to Austria, where he attended the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in 1928. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, he emigrated to the United States.

==Background==
Gerschenkron was born in Odesa, Ukraine (then a part of the Russian empire), into a well-to-do Jewish family from Bessarabia. When he was 16, he and his father left Russia during the period of the Bolshevik Revolution. They eventually settled in Vienna, Austria. There he taught himself languages, including German and Latin. In 1924, he enrolled in the University of Vienna&#x27;s school of economics, graduating in 1928.

After graduation, Gerschenkron got married and had a child. He found work in Vienna as a representative for a Belgian motorcycle firm. He worked for the firm for three years, but then decided to commit himself to politics, in particular the Social Democrats. However, in 1934 the party ceased to exist after the Austrian Civil War.

In 1938, Gerschenkron and his family emigrated to the United States after the annexation of Austria to the German Reich. Charles Gulick, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, invited Gerschenkron to be his research assistant. Gerschenkron spent twelve months researching and writing to help produce Gulick&#x27;s book, &quot;Austria: From Habsburg to Hitler&quot;. He researched at the University of California, Berkeley, for five years and then in 1943 he moved to Washington, D. C., to join the Federal Reserve Board.

In 1944 he worked with the Federal Reserve in the Research and Statistics department. During his time on the Federal Reserve Board, Gerschenkron established himself as an expert on the Soviet economy. His knowledge was of vital importance to the Board, because it was during a time when the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States was a central issue. He worked on the Federal Reserve Board for four years, and was eventually promoted to the head of the International Section.

In 1945, Gerschenkron became an American citizen and in 1948, he left the Federal Reserve Board to accept a position as a tenured professor at Harvard University. He was a professor of economics at Harvard for about 25 years. There, he taught economic history and Soviet studies.

Gerschenkron was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963) and the American Philosophical Society (1970).

In a 2012 research article, the Dutch social historian Marcel van der Linden demonstrates that Gerschenkron was a member of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party of Austria, one of the two major political parties in Austria, which has ties to the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) and the Austrian Chamber of Labour (AK); and, later, the Communist Party of Austria, both banned between 1933 and 1945 under both the Fatherland Front regime and the Third Reich control of Austria after the 1938 Anschluss. Gerschenkron kept his former political affiliations a secret after he was able to immigrate to the United States.

==Research==
Gerschenkron kept to his Russian roots—in his economics, history and as a critic of Russian literature. His early work concentrated on development in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In a celebrated 1947 article, he found the &quot;Gerschenkron effect&quot; (changing the base year for an index determines the growth rate of the index). His early work often pursued the statistical tricks of Soviet planners.

===The &quot;Gerschenkron effect&quot;===
In 1954, Gerschenkron published a celebrated article, &quot;A Dollar Index of Soviet Machinery Output, 1927–1928 to 1937&quot;, in which he introduced what is now called the Gerschenkron effect (the difference between calculated Paasche and Laspeyres volume indexes). In this study, he constructed a series of dollar indexes of Soviet industrial output for the purpose of proving the deficiencies of the official Soviet index during that time (1927–1937). He showed that the high rate of growth of Soviet industrial production was an effect of index number bias: a Laspeyres index calculated on the basis of 1926–1927 weights significantly overstates real expansion. This &quot;Gerschenkron effect&quot; was a significant finding that deflated the announced superior Soviet growth.

The OECD website gives a more detailed description of the Gerschenkron effect:

===&quot;Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective&quot;===
In 1951, Gerschenkron wrote an essay &quot;Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective&quot;, a cornerstone of his career, and of significance to European economic history. In it, he advanced the linear stages theory of economic development, which posits that development goes forward in largely determined stages.

The essay deals with &quot;economic backwardness&quot;, and argued that the more backward an economy is at the outset of economic development, the more likely certain conditions are to occur. Gerschenkron stated that a country such as Russia, backward relative to Britain when it embarked on industrialization, did not go through the same stages. His theory of economic backwardness contrasts strongly with other uniform stages theories, in particular Rostow&#x27;s stages of growth. It predicts that the more &quot;economically backward&quot; a country is, the more we will see:
* More rapid rates of industrial growth
* A greater stress on producer or capital goods as compared to consumer goods
* More rapid growth spurts rather than gradual growth rates
* Larger scale of plants and firms and a greater emphasis on up-to-date technology: backward countries are able to purchase machinery from early producers, for example Russia (most backward country) would import Britain&#x27;s (least backward economy) machinery and transportation equipment
* A greater emphasis on capital-intensive production rather than labor-intensive production
* A lower standard of living
* Less role played by agriculture
* A more active role by the government and large banks in supplying capital and entrepreneurship
* More &quot;virulent&quot; ideologies of growth.

Gerschenkron did not define economic backwardness but alluded to related factors: income per capita, amount of social overhead capital, literacy, savings rates and level of technology. He also referred to a northwest-to-southeast axis within Europe, with Britain as the least backward, followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, and—the most backward—Russia. In his essay, he mostly discusses Britain, Germany and Russia.

Despite his roots in the Austrian school, he criticized the &quot;penny pinching, &#x27;not-one-heller-more-policies&#x27;&quot; of the prominent Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk when the latter was Austrian Minister of Finance. He laid much of the blame for Austria&#x27;s economic backwardness on Böhm-Bawerk&#x27;s unwillingness to spend heavily on public works projects.

===&quot;Bread and Democracy in Germany&quot;===
In 1943, Gerschenkron published a book titled &quot;Bread and Democracy in Germany&quot;. In this study, he analyzes the problem of the relation between democracy and the protection of agricultural products, particularly of grain, in Germany. Gerschenkron understands that the establishment of democracy in Germany depends on numerous factors, and in his book he specifically deals with one aspect of the problem, the position of the Junkers and the agricultural policy in its relation to democracy.

He defines the economic history of the problem as this: In 1879, Germany introduced a new tariff and formulated a definite policy, which protected domestic grain production against overseas competition. This policy worked in favor of the big estate owners, the Junkers, who held important political positions in Prussia. It also worked in favor to a major part of the German peasantry. In 1926, eight years after the Germans were defeated at World War I, the Junkers started to plot against the forces of democracy. They introduced a new era of increased agricultural protection, which once again favored the peasants and Junkers.

Gerschenkron arrives at this conclusion, &quot;that democratic reconstruction of Germany... in insurance of world peace calls for a radical elimination of the Junkers as a social and economic group.&quot; He also recommends a radical land reform. To achieve the readjustment of agriculture and to place it on a competitive basis he suggests the introduction of a government trade monopoly of the bulk of agricultural products in Germany. With a monopoly in place, the government could set a price policy, which would force a number of farmers to discontinue grain production for the market and eventually carry out the needed adjustment of high cost agriculture to the international market conditions.

Gerschenkron also warns of the possible difficulties of creating a government monopoly. He believes the management of the monopoly would require &quot;great practical skill and energy&quot;. He believes the Germans should include this program of the agricultural adjustment plan in the peace treaties and entrust its execution and supervision to an international economic agency.

==Influence==
Gerschenkron had a profound influence on his students. At Harvard, he led the Economic History Workshop and taught courses on Soviet economics and economic history. In economic history he taught a year-long course required of all graduate economics students. His course required two major dissertation papers and a final exam. He also led evening seminars once a week in which his graduate students would discuss ideas for dissertations and evaluate quantitative techniques.

Many of his students went on to have productive careers, and a good number of them have attained presidency of the Economic History Association. Ten of his students in the mid-1960s prepared a Festschrift in his honor. The book was titled &quot;Industrialization in Two Systems&quot; and was published in 1966.

==Gerschenkron as a scholar==
Gerschenkron was known as an extremely bright scholar. As one of his former students Deirdre McCloskey put it, &quot;Alexander Gerschenkron was not the best teacher or the best economist or the best historian among these—nor even, I think, the best human being. But he was the best scholar I have known.&quot;

Gerschenkron studied many subjects, from history of economics, economics of the Soviet Union, statistics, Greek poetry, and a great deal in between. He also learned many languages. From his studies in Austria, he learned Latin, Greek, French and German. Later in life he would pick up languages with ease—Swedish one week, Bulgarian the next. As an example of his facility with languages, Deirdre McCloskey tells of Gerschenkron&#x27;s harsh evaluation of a Russian translation: &quot;He wrote a devastating review of a translation from Russian of a book in economics, attacking in detail the author&#x27;s apparently feeble command of the language. The translator had the temerity to approach Gerschenkron at a conference and say amiably, &quot;I want you to know, Professor Gerschenkron, that I am not angry about your review.&quot; Gerschnkron replied, &quot;Angry? Why should you be angry? Ashamed, yes; angry, no.&quot;

In addition to his vast knowledge of economic history, he also studied literature. He and his wife wrote an article together on translations of Shakespeare, which was published in a literary journal.

==Alexander Gerschenkron Prize==
The Economic History Association created the Alexander Gershenkron Prize. It is awarded for the best dissertation in the economic history of an area outside of the United States or Canada. To be eligible for the Alexander Gerschenkron Prize, you must have received your Ph.D. within 2 years of when the award is given out.

<text>Pio of Pietrelcina (born Francesco Forgione; 25 May 188723 September 1968), widely known as , was an Italian Capuchin friar, priest, stigmatist, and mystic. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, celebrated on 23 September.

Pio joined the Capuchins when he was fifteen and spent most of his religious life in the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo. He was marked by stigmata in 1918, leading to several investigations by the Holy See. Despite temporary sanctions imposed by the Vatican, his reputation kept increasing during his life, attracting many followers to San Giovanni Rotondo. He was the founder of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, a hospital built near the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo.

After his death, his devotion continued to spread among believers all over the world. He was beatified on 2 May 1999 and canonized on 16 June 2002 by Pope John Paul II. His relics are exposed in the sanctuary of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, next to the convent of San Giovanni Rotondo, now a major pilgrimage site.

==Life==
===Early life===
Francesco Forgione was born on 25 May 1887 to Grazio Mario Forgione (1860–1946) and Maria Giuseppa Di Nunzio (1859–1929), in Pietrelcina, a town in the province of Benevento, in the Southern Italian region of Campania. His parents were peasant farmers. He was baptized in the nearby Santa Anna Chapel, which stands upon the walls of a castle. He later served as an altar boy in this same chapel. He had an older brother, Michele, and three younger sisters, Felicita, Pellegrina, and Grazia (who was later to become a Bridgettine nun). His parents had two other children who died in infancy. When he was baptized, he was given the name Francesco. He stated that by the time he was five years old, he had already made the decision to dedicate his entire life to God. He worked on the land up to the age of 10, looking after the small flock of sheep the family owned.

Pietrelcina was a town where feast days of saints were celebrated throughout the year, and the Forgione family was deeply religious. They attended Mass daily, prayed the Rosary nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honour of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Although Francesco&#x27;s parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children.

According to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco (who was later his spiritual director in San Marco in Lamis), the young Francesco was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe gastroenteritis. At ten he caught typhoid fever.

As a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly visions and ecstasies. In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young Capuchin who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to Morcone, a community north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Order. The friars there informed them that they were interested in accepting Francesco into their community, but he needed to be better educated.

Francesco&#x27;s father went to the United States in search of work to pay for private tutoring for his son, to meet the academic requirements to enter the Capuchin Order. It was in this period that Francesco received the sacrament of Confirmation on 27 September 1899. He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On 6 January 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the novitiate of the Capuchin friars at Morcone. On 22 January, he took the Franciscan habit and the name of Fra (Friar) Pio, in honour of Pope Pius I, whose relic is preserved in the Santa Anna Chapel in Pietrelcina. He took the simple vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.

===Priesthood===
Commencing his seven-year study for the priesthood, Pio travelled to the friary of Saint Francis of Assisi in Umbria. At 17, he fell ill, complaining of loss of appetite, insomnia, exhaustion, fainting spells, and migraines. He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees point to this time as being that at which inexplicable phenomena began to occur. During prayers, for example, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio&#x27;s fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in ecstasy, and levitating above the ground.

In June 1905, Pio&#x27;s health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return home. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, he still made his solemn profession on 27 January 1907.

In August 1910, Pio was ordained a priest by Archbishop Paolo Schinosi at the Cathedral of Benevento. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of Our Lady of the Angels.

His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family in his hometown of Pietrelcina while still retaining the Capuchin habit. He stayed in Pietrelcina until 1916, due to his health and the need to take care of his family when his father and brother briefly emigrated to the United States. During these years, Padre Pio frequently wrote mystic letters to his spiritual directors, Father Benedetto and Father Agostino, two friars from the Capuchin monastery of San Marco in Lamis.

===Arrival at San Giovanni Rotondo===

On 4 September 1916, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, Our Lady of Grace Capuchin Friary, located in the Gargano Mountains in San Giovanni Rotondo in the Province of Foggia. At that time the community numbered seven friars. He remained at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. In the priesthood, Padre Pio was known to perform a number of successful conversions to Catholicism.

Pio was devoted to rosary meditations. He compared weekly confession to dusting a room weekly, and recommended the performance of meditation and self-examination twice daily: once in the morning, as preparation to face the day, and once again in the evening, as retrospection. His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote: &quot;pray, hope, and don&#x27;t worry&quot;. He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.

Many people who heard of him travelled to San Giovanni Rotondo to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Pio&#x27;s mother died in the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Pio had his elderly father Grazio live with him. His brother Michele also moved in. Pio&#x27;s father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.

===First World War and aftermath===

When World War I started, four friars from his community were selected for military service in the Italian army. At that time, Pio was a teacher and spiritual director at the seminary. When one more friar was called into service, Pio was put in charge of the community. On 15 November 1915, he was drafted and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in Naples. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on 16 March 1918, he was declared unfit for service and discharged completely.
In September 1918, Pio began to display permanent wounds on his hands and feet, known as stigmata in reference to Christ&#x27;s wounds. In the next months, his reputation of sainthood grew rapidly in the region of San Giovanni Rotondo, attracting hundreds of believers at the monastery coming each day to see him.

People who had started rebuilding their lives after the war began to see in Pio a symbol of hope. Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, bilocation, levitation, prophecy, miracles, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only the Holy Eucharist without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of tongues, the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.

Pio increasingly became well known among the wider populace. He became a spiritual director, and developed five rules for spiritual growth: weekly confession, daily Communion, spiritual reading, meditation, and examination of conscience.

By 1925, Pio had converted an old convent building into a medical clinic with a few beds intended primarily for people in extreme need. In 1940, a committee was set-up to establish a bigger clinic and donations started to be made. Construction began in 1947.

According to Luzzatto, the bulk of the money for financing the hospital came directly from Emanuele Brunatto, a keen follower of Pio, who had made his fortune in the black market in German-occupied France. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) also contributed 250 million Italian lire.
Lodovico Montini, head of Democrazia Cristiana, and his brother Giovanni Battista Montini (later Pope Paul VI) facilitated engagement by UNRRA. The hospital was initially to be named &quot;Fiorello LaGuardia&quot;, but eventually presented as the work of Pio himself. The Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza () opened in 1956. Pio handed direct control to the Holy See. However, in order that Pio might directly supervise the project, Pope Pius XII granted him a dispensation from his vow of poverty in 1957. Some of Pio&#x27;s detractors have subsequently suggested there had been misappropriation of funds.

===Death===

Pio died on 23 September 1968 at the age of 81. His health deteriorated in the 1960s, but he continued his spiritual works. On 22 September 1968, Padre Pio celebrated the Mass to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, with a huge crowd of pilgrims present to celebrate the event as well as television crews. Due to a large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, the superior of the monastery decided that a solemn Mass be celebrated. Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and frail. His voice was weak, and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the Mass.

Early in the morning of 23 September 1968, Pio made his last confession and renewed his Franciscan vows. As was customary, he had his rosary in his hands, though he did not have the strength to pray the Hail Marys aloud, instead repeating the words (). At around 2:30a.m., he died in his cell in San Giovanni Rotondo.

A few days before dying the stigmata had disappeared. Examining Padre Pio&#x27;s body, the doctor who was present at his deathbed observed that the wounds of the stigmata were completely healed, without any trace or scar. His body was placed in a coffin in the church of the monastery to allow pilgrims to pay their respects. The funeral ceremony was held on 26 September, with an estimated 100,000 people attending. After a funeral procession in San Giovanni Rotondo and the funeral Mass, the body was buried in the crypt in the Church of Our Lady of Grace.

==Supernatural phenomena==
Pio was said to have had mystical gifts such as reading souls, the ability to bilocate and the ability to work favours and healings before they were requested of him. His reported supernatural experiences also include celestial visions, communication with angels and physical fights with Satan and demons. The reports of supernatural phenomena surrounding Pio attracted fame and amazement, even if the Vatican seemed sceptical. Some of these phenomena were reported by Pio himself in letters written to his spiritual directors, while others have been reported by his followers.

===Stigmata===

Pio wrote in his letters that, early in his priesthood, he experienced bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations indicative of the (not yet visible) stigmata. In a letter to his spiritual companion and confessor Father Agostino Gemelli, dated 21 March 1912, Pio wrote of his devotion to the mystical body of Christ and the intuition that he would bear the stigmata. Luzzatto claims that in this letter Pio uses unrecognized passages from a book by the stigmatized mystic Gemma Galgani.

In a 1915 letter, Agostino asked Pio specific questions, including: when did he first experience visions, whether he was stigmatic, and whether he felt the pains of the Passion of Christ, namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Pio replied that he had had visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904) and that he was stigmatic, adding that he had been so terrified by the phenomenon that he begged God to withdraw his stigmata. He also wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.

On 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio is said to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata. His stigmatism reportedly continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers. Pio conveyed to Agostino that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. Though he said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news that he was a stigmatic had begun to spread. Pio often wore red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet, saying that he was embarrassed by the marks.

Agostino Gemelli claimed that the wounds were consistent with those that soldiers had inflicted on themselves &quot;by the use of a caustic substance&quot;, while Amico Bignami considered that Pio&#x27;s wounds might be a skin necrosis that was hindered from healing through the use of iodine tincture or similar chemicals.

Once made public, the wounds were studied by a number of physicians, some hired by the Vatican as part of an independent investigation. Some claimed that the wounds were unexplainable and never seemed to have become infected. Despite seeming to heal they would then reappear periodically. Alberto Caserta took X-rays of Pio&#x27;s hands in 1954 and found no abnormality in the bone structure. Some critics accused Pio of faking the stigmata, for example by using carbolic acid to make the wounds. Maria De Vito (the cousin of the local pharmacist Valentini Vista at Foggia) testified that the young Pio bought carbolic acid and the great quantity of four grams of veratrine &quot;without presenting any medical prescription whatsoever&quot; and &quot;in great secret&quot;. Veratrine is a &quot;mixture of alkaloids&quot;, a &quot;highly caustic product&quot;: &quot;Veratrine is so poisonous, that only a doctor can decide whether to prescribe it&quot;, as the pharmacist Vista stated in front of witnesses. Veratrine was once used as a paralyzing muscle insecticide, primarily against lice, but was also described by pharmacists as an &quot;external stimulant&quot; that renders one insensitive to pain. Pio maintained that the carbolic acid was used to sterilize syringes used for medical treatments and that after being subjected to a practical joke where veratrine was mixed with snuff tobacco, causing uncontrollable sneezing after ingestion, he decided to acquire his own quantity of the substance in order to play the same joke on his confreres; the bishop of Volterra, Raffaele Rossi came to share this view, believing that &quot;Instead of malice, what is revealed here is Padre Pio&#x27;s simplicity, and his playful spirit&quot;, and that &quot;the stigmata at issue are not a work of the devil, nor a gross deceit, a fraud, the trick of a devious and malicious person[...] his &#x27;stigmata&#x27; do not seem to me a morbid product of external suggestion.&quot; Rossi saw these stigmata as a &quot;real fact&quot;.

===Transverberation===

In August 1918, a few weeks before reportedly receiving the stigmata, Pio described a mystical experience during which he felt being pierced and burnt spiritually and physically. According to Pio, this mystical experience began on 5 August and ended on 7 August. Padre Benedetto, his spiritual director, interpreted this phenomenon as a transverberation. Pio later claimed that this experience left a physical wound on his left side. Most witnesses who examined Pio&#x27;s wounds reported that he had a wound on his left side, around three inches long and the shape of a cross.

===Bilocation===
Pio was believed by his followers to have the gift of bilocation, the ability to be in two places at the same time. When bishop Raffaele Rossi asked him about bilocation as part of a Vatican inquiry, Pio replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how it is or the nature of this phenomenon—and I certainly don&#x27;t give it much thought—but it did happen to me to be in the presence of this or that person, to be in this or that place; I do not know whether my mind was transported there, or what I saw was some sort of representation of the place or the person; I do not know whether I was there with my body or without it.&quot;

===Healing===
In the 1999 book &quot;Padre Pio: The Wonder Worker&quot;, a segment by Irish priest Malachy Gerard Carroll describes the story of Gemma de Giorgi, a Sicilian girl whose blindness was believed to have been cured during a visit to Pio. Gemma, who was brought to San Giovanni Rotondo in 1947 by her grandmother, was born without pupils. During her trip to see Pio, the little girl began to see objects, including a steamboat and the sea. Gemma&#x27;s grandmother did not believe the child had been healed. After Gemma forgot to ask Pio for grace during her confession, her grandmother implored the priest to ask God to restore her sight. Pio told her, &quot;The child must not weep and neither must you for the child sees and you know she sees.&quot;

According to the bishop of Volterra, Raffaele Rossi, in charge of investigating Pio: &quot;Of the alleged healings, many are unconfirmed or non-existent. In Padre Pio&#x27;s correspondence, however, there are some credible declarations that attribute miracles to his intercession. But without medical confirmation it is difficult to reach a conclusion, and the issue remains open.&quot;

===Prophecy===
In 1947, 27-year-old Father Karol Józef Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II) visited Pio, who heard his confession. Austrian Cardinal Alfons Stickler reported that Wojtyła confided to him that during this meeting, Pio told him he would one day ascend to &quot;the highest post in the church, though further confirmation is needed.&quot; Stickler said that Wojtyła believed that the prophecy was fulfilled when he became a cardinal. John Paul&#x27;s secretary, Stanisław Dziwisz, denies the prediction, while George Weigel&#x27;s biography &quot;Witness to Hope&quot;, which contains an account of the same visit, does not mention it.

===Others===
Rossi describes in Pio a &quot;very intense and pleasant fragrance, similar to the scent of the violet&quot;, and concludes that he was unable to determine the origin of the scent. Pio replied that he had intellectual visions seen through the eyes of the intellect, accounts of diabolical assaults and harassment against him, malicious visions under human shape and beastly shape, and Pio confirmed to Rossi: &quot;A very few times I happened to feel inside me with clarity someone&#x27;s fault, or sin, or virtue, of people of whom I had some knowledge, at least generally&quot;.

==Investigations by the Vatican==

The Vatican initially imposed severe sanctions on Pio in the 1920s to reduce publicity about him: he was forbidden from saying Mass in public, blessing people, answering letters, showing his stigmata publicly, and communicating with Padre Benedetto, his spiritual director.

The church authorities decided that Pio be relocated to another convent in northern Italy. 
The local people threatened to riot, and the Vatican left him where he was. A second plan for removal was also changed. Nevertheless, from 1921 to 1922 he was prevented from publicly performing his priestly duties, such as hearing confessions and saying Mass. From 1924 to 1931, the Holy See made statements denying that the events in Pio&#x27;s life were due to any divine cause.

=== Luigi Romanelli, medical examination from 1919 ===
A large number of doctors visited Pio to verify whether the stigmata were real. The first to study his wounds was Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the civil hospital of Barletta, by order of the provincial father superior, on 15 and 16 May 1919. In his report, among other things, he wrote: &quot;The lesions on his hands are covered with a membrane that is reddish-brown in color, without any bleeding, swelling, or inflammation of the surrounding tissue. I am convinced without a doubt that the wounds are not just superficial. When I press together my thumb on the palm of his hand and my index finger on the back of his hand, I clearly perceive that a vacuum exists between them.&quot;

=== Amico Bignami, medical examination from 1919 ===
Two months later, on 26 July, pathologist Amico Bignami arrived in San Giovanni Rotondo. Bignami conducted a medical examination of Pio&#x27;s wounds in 1919 and launched several hypotheses, among which was that the wounds were a skin necrosis that was hindered from healing by chemicals such as iodine tincture.

=== Giorgio Festa, medical examinations 1919 and 1920 ===
Festa was a physician who examined Pio in 1919 and 1920. He was obviously impressed by the fragrance of the stigmata. Festa, as Bignami before, had described the side wound as cruciform. In his report to the Holy Office of 1925, Festa arrived at a benevolent verdict and attacked Gemelli&#x27;s critical view of Pio&#x27;s stigmata, with theological arguments playing the lead role. He wrote the stigmata &quot;are not the product of a trauma of external origin, nor are they due to the application of potently irritating chemicals&quot;.

=== Agostino Gemelli, psychiatric examination 1920 and medical examination 1925 ===
In 1920, Father Agostino Gemelli – a physician and psychologist – was commissioned by Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val to visit Pio and carry out a clinical examination of the wounds. &quot;For this reason, despite having gone to Gargano Peninsula on his own initiative, without being asked by any ecclesiastical authority, Gemelli did not hesitate to make his private letter to the Holy Office a kind of unofficial report on Padre Pio.&quot; Gemelli wanted to express himself fully on the matter and wanted to meet the friar. Pio showed a closed attitude towards the new investigator: he refused the visit requesting the written authorization of the Holy Office. Father Gemelli&#x27;s protests that he believed he had the right to subject the friar to a medical examination of the stigmata were in vain. The friar, supported by his superiors, conditioned the examination to a permit requested through the hierarchy, without taking into account the credentials of Father Agostino Gemelli. Therefore, Gemelli left the convent, irritated and offended for not being allowed to examine the stigmata. He came to the conclusion that Francesco Forgione was &quot;a man of restricted field of knowledge, low psychic energy, monotonous ideas, little volition.&quot; Gemelli critically judged Pio: &quot;The case is one of suggestion unconsciously planted by Father Benedetto in the weak mind of Padre Pio, producing those characteristic manifestations of psittacism that are intrinsic to the hysteric mind.&quot;

On behalf of the Holy Office, Gemelli re-examined Pio in 1925, writing a report in April 1926. This time Pio allowed him to see the wounds. Gemelli saw as its cause the use of a corrosive substance Pio had applied himself to these wounds. The Jesuit Festa had previously tried to question Gemelli&#x27;s comments on stigmata in general. Gemelli responded to this criticism in his report and resorted to responding to his knowledge of self-inflicted wounds. He therefore clarified his statements about the nature of Pio&#x27;s wounds: &quot;Anyone with experience in forensic medicine, and above all in variety by sores and wounds that self-destructive soldiers were presented during the war, can have no doubt that these were wounds of erosion caused by the use of a caustic substance. The base of the sore and its shape are in every way similar to the sores observed in soldiers who procured them with chemical means.&quot;

Once again, Gemelli judged Pio&#x27;s mental abilities as limited: &quot;He [Pio] is the ideal partner with whom former Minister Provincial Father Benedetto is able to create an incubus-succubus pair[...] He is a good priest: calm, quiet, meek, more because of the mental deficiency than out of virtue. A poor soul, able to repeat a few stereotypical religious phrases, a poor, sick man who has learned his lesson from his master, Father Benedetto.&quot; Gemelli wrote in 1940 and later several times to the Holy Office on what he considered to be unjustified claims to the sanctity of Pio.

=== Raffaele Rossi, First Apostolic Visitation of 1921 ===
The Bishop of Volterra, Raffaele Rossi, Carmelite, was formally commissioned on 11 June 1921, by the Holy Office to make a canonical inquiry concerning Pio. Rossi began his Apostolic Visitation on 14 June in San Giovanni Rotondo with the interrogation of witnesses, two diocesan priests and seven friars. After eight days of investigation, he finally completed a benevolent report, which he sent to the Holy Office on 4 October the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. The extensive and detailed report essentially stated the following: Pio, of whom Rossi had a favourable impression, was a good religious and the San Giovanni Rotondo convent was a good community. The stigmata could not be explained, but certainly were not a work of the devil or an act of gross deceit or fraud; neither were they the trick of a devious and malicious person. During the interviews with the witnesses, which Rossi undertook a total of three times, he let himself be shown the stigmata of the then-34-year-old Pio. Rossi saw these stigmata as a &quot;real fact&quot;.

In his notes, which have been put directly on paper, and the final report, Rossi describes the shape and appearance of the wounds. Those in the hands were &quot;very visible&quot;. Those in the feet were &quot;disappearing. What could be observed resembled two dot-shaped elevations [literally: &#x27;buttons&#x27;] with whiter and gentler skin.&quot; As for the chest, it says: &quot;In his side, the sign is represented by a triangular spot, the colour of red wine, and by other smaller ones, not anymore, then, by a sort of upside-down cross such as the one seen in 1919 by Dr. Bignami and Dr. Festa.&quot; Rossi also made a request to the Holy Office, a chronicle to consult with Pio, who was assembling Father Benedetto, or at least to have the material he has collected so that one day he could write about the life of Pio.

According to Rossi, &quot;Of the alleged healings, many are unconfirmed or non-existent. In Padre Pio&#x27;s correspondence, however, there are some credible declarations that attribute miracles to his intercession. But without medical confirmation, it is difficult to reach a conclusion, and the issue remains open.&quot; According to Lucia Ceci, Rossi could not find any of the attributed miracles.

When Rossi asked him about bilocation, Pio replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how it is or the nature of this phenomenon—and I certainly don&#x27;t give it much thought—but it did happen to me to be in the presence of this or that person, to be in this or that place; I do not know whether my mind was transported there, or what I saw was some sort of representation of the place or the person; I do not know whether I was there with my body or without it.&quot;

=== John XXIII, investigations and tape recordings, after 1958 ===
Pope John XXIII was skeptical of Padre Pio. At the beginning of his tenure, he learned that Father Pio&#x27;s opponents had placed listening devices in his monastery cell and confessional, recording his confessions with tape. Outside his semi-official journal, John XXIII wrote on four sheets of paper that he prayed for &quot;PP&quot; (Padre Pio) and the discovery by means of tapes, if what they imply is true, of his intimate and indecent relationships with women from his impenetrable praetorian guard around his person pointed to a terrible calamity of souls. John XXIII had probably never listened to the tapes himself, but assumed the correctness of this view: &quot;The reason for my spiritual tranquillity, and it is a priceless privilege and grace, is that I feel personally pure of this contamination that for forty years has corroded hundreds of thousands of souls made foolish and deranged to an unheard-of degree.&quot; According to Luzzatto, the Vatican had not ordered this wiretap. In another journal note, John XXIII wrote that he wanted to take action. In fact, he ordered another Apostolic Visitation.

=== Carlo Maccari, Second Apostolic Visitation of 1960 ===
Father Carlo Maccari was Secretary-General of the Diocese of Rome and met Pio nine times altogether. There was reciprocal mistrust between Pio and Maccari, who wrote in his diary: &quot;Reticence, narrowness of mind, lies - these are the weapons he uses to evade my questions ... Overall impression: pitiful.&quot; Maccari noted in his report that Pio had inadequate religious education. He works a lot for a man of his age. He is not an ascetic and has many connections to the outside world. In general, there is too much mixing of the &quot;sacred&quot; and the &quot;all too human&quot;. In his report, Maccari noted by name the women who revealed at which time to have been the lover of Pio, but without assessing the veracity of these statements. Maccari focused on assessing the fanaticism of Pio&#x27;s social environment, describing it as &quot;religious conceptions that oscillate between superstition and magic.&quot; Maccari called Pio&#x27;s supporters &quot;a vast and dangerous organization&quot;. Pio never had his own supporters advised to moderation. Maccari wondered how God could allow &quot;so much deception&quot;.

Maccari finished his critical report with a list of recommendations for further dealing with Father Pio. The brothers of Santa Maria delle Grazie should gradually be relocated, a new abbot should come from outside the region. No one should be allowed to confess to Pio more than once a month. The hospital was to be given new statutes to sever the responsibilities of the medical and spiritual &quot;healing&quot; capuchins. Following Maccari&#x27;s Apostolic Visitation, John XXIII noted in his diary that he sees Father Pio as a &quot;straw idol&quot; (&quot;idolo di stoppa&quot;).

===Rehabilitation===

In 1933, Pope Pius XI ordered a reversal of the ban on Pio&#x27;s public celebration of Mass, arguing, &quot;I have not been badly disposed toward Padre Pio, but I have been badly informed.&quot; In 1934, the friar was again allowed to hear confessions. He was also given honorary permission to preach despite never having taken the exam for the preaching license. Pope Pius XII, who assumed the papacy in 1939, even encouraged devotees to visit Pio.

Finally, in the mid-1960s Pope Paul VI (pope from 1963 to 1978) dismissed all accusations against Padre Pio.

== Personal views ==

=== Religion ===

Pio was a strong proponent of weekly confession, describing it as &quot;the soul&#x27;s bath&quot;. Pio established five rules for spiritual growth, which included weekly confession, daily communion, spiritual reading, meditation, and frequent examination of one&#x27;s conscience. He taught his spiritual followers that suffering is a special sign of God&#x27;s love, for it makes you &quot;resemble His divine son in His anguish in the desert and on the hill of Calvary.&quot;

Pio held a harsh attitude towards vain women, stating: &quot;Women who satisfy their vanity in their dress can never put on the life of Jesus Christ; moreover they even lose the ornaments of their soul as soon as this idol enters into their heart.&quot;

Pio also held to strict rules concerning modesty, and refused confession to women who did not wear skirts that extended a minimum of past the knees. He posted a notice at the entrance of the Church of St. Mary of All Graces in San Giovanni Rotondo, reading: &quot;The Church is the house of God. It is forbidden for men to enter with bare arms or in shorts. It is forbidden for women to enter in trousers, without a veil on their head, in short clothing, low necklines, sleeveless or immodest dresses.&quot;

Although Pio was not satisfied with some changes following the Second Vatican Council, in particular changes with the liturgy, he emphasized obedience to the church. On one occasion, Pio met with Suor Pia, his sister and a former nun who left her order following the council. Suor Pia was a traditionalist and was upset at the changes made by her liberal superiors, causing her to leave her convent at the age of seventy. Pio burst into tears and snapped at her over this decision, telling his sister &quot;They are wrong and you are right, but you still must obey. You must return.&quot; She refused, causing him to weep uncontrollably and continue praying for her.

Following the publication of &quot;Humanae vitae&quot;, Pio was distraught over criticism aimed at the encyclical. He wrote to Pope Paul VI over this, affirming his obedience to the Church&#x27;s teaching on birth control and reassuring Paul VI in his time of need. Pio informed the pope that he would offer up his daily prayers and suffering for the pontiff, due to Paul VI&#x27;s defence of &quot;eternal truth, which never changes with the passing of years.&quot;

As Pio grew older, he became increasingly distrustful of television. After the Second World War, when Pio&#x27;s nephew, Ettorne Masone, asked Pio for advice on opening a movie house, Pio warned him to be careful about what movies he would show. Pio stated, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to contribute to the propagation of evil.&quot; By the 1960s, Pio was displeased that the Capuchins were now permitted to watch television. To Pio, television was responsible for the destruction of the family life and he strongly warned others not to buy one when asked. On one occasion, when asked about motion pictures, Pio replied &quot;The devil is in it!&quot; On another occasion, Pio told a penitent in confession that the reason the penitent&#x27;s car had broken down the day before was because the penitent was driving to a movie theatre.

Pio became exceedingly pessimistic about the state of the world towards the end of his life. When asked what awaited the world in the future, Pio replied &quot;Can&#x27;t you see the world is catching on fire?&quot; In his last three years, he began to withdraw further from life, feeling unworthy and unsure of his salvation. Pio frequently asked his superior, &quot;Give me the obedience to die.&quot;

=== Politics ===
Padre Pio was not especially concerned with politics, but voted in Italian elections and voiced his opinions on various issues. He initially felt that Benito Mussolini had done a good job during his rule, but his feelings toward Mussolini quickly became negative as time passed. When visited by one of Mussolini&#x27;s messengers, Pio yelled at the man, &quot;So now you come to me, after you have destroyed Italy. You can tell Mussolini that nothing can save Italy now! Nothing!&quot; Pio also thought highly of the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom he described as a &quot;great man&quot;. Additionally, Pio expressed great concern over the spread of communism during his life and frequently prayed to help combat it.

In 1948, in a letter written to Alcide De Gasperi, Pio noted his support for the Christian Democracy party. Pio&#x27;s involvement is attributed to having helped the party win elections, with Italian communists hating Pio for it. One communist spokesman grumbled that Pio&#x27;s presence at the voting polls &quot;took votes away from us&quot;.
Following the Christian Democracy&#x27;s political victories in elections, Pio was continually consulted by political Italian leaders including Aldo Moro, Antonio Segni, Mariano Rumor, and Giovanni Leone. Pio received letters requesting his prayers throughout his life, including one from Alfonso XIII in March 1923. Pio also prayed for various notable political figures, including George V.

In 1963, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Pio broke down in tears. When asked by another priest if he would pray for Kennedy&#x27;s salvation, Pio replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not necessary. He&#x27;s already in Paradise.&quot;

The Italian historian Sergio Luzzatto, a specialist in the history of Italian fascism, wrote, in 2011, a biography of Padre Pio in which he suggests that a &quot;clerical-fascist mixture&quot; developed around Padre Pio. Luzzatto relates that in August 1920, on the feast of the Assumption, Pio blessed a flag for a group of local veterans who were trying to develop links with local fascists to fight against communists. He also states that Pio subsequently met with , a fascist politician from Foggia, and became his confessor and that of members of his militia. He suggests that Caradonna mounted a &quot;praetorian guard&quot; around Padre Pio to prevent any attempts to remove him from the monastery and transfer him elsewhere.

==Posthumous veneration==

=== Canonization ===

In 1982, the Holy See authorized the archbishop of Manfredonia to open an investigation to determine whether Pio should be canonized. The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990, Pio was declared a Servant of God, the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation, however, did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio&#x27;s stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.

Beginning in 1990, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him venerable. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio&#x27;s intercession. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed and set 23 September as the date of his liturgical feast.

The Mass for his beatification was celebrated on 2 May 1999 by John Paul II on St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome, with more than 300,000 faithful attending the ceremony. In his homily, John Paul II mentioned Padre Pio&#x27;s stigmata and his mystical gifts:

After his beatification, another case of healing attributed to his intercession was examined, an Italian boy named Matteo Pio Colella who recovered from a coma. After further consideration of Padre Pio&#x27;s virtues and ability to do good even after his death, John Paul II promulgated the decree of canonization on 28 February 2002. The Mass for the canonization was celebrated by John Paul II on 16 June 2002 at St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome, with an estimated 300,000 people attending the ceremony.

In the Palmarian Catholic Church, based in El Palmar de Troya, Andalusia, Spain, Pio of Pietrelcina is celebrated as a canonised saint, having been canonised by the Palmarian Holy See on 12 September 1978 in the &quot;Tenth Papal Document&quot; of Pope Gregory XVII, the entirety of which is dedicated to this singular event. He was the first person to be declared a saint by the Palmarian Catholic Church since it began its claim to the Papacy.

===Pilgrimage sites===
The town of San Giovanni Rotondo, where Padre Pio spent most of his life, is the main pilgrimage site dedicated to his memory. The Santa Maria delle Grazie Church, which is the church of the Capuchin monastery where Padre Pio celebrated Mass, has become a pilgrimage site for his followers after his death in 1968. As the number of pilgrims kept increasing over the years, the Capuchins decided to build a new shrine near the church. The construction of the shrine began in 1991 and was completed in 2004. On 1 July 2004, John Paul II dedicated the Sanctuary of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, sometimes referred as the &quot;Padre Pio Pilgrimage Church&quot;. The sanctuary has a capacity of around 6,000 people and its parvis has a 30,000 capacity. The relics of Padre Pio are located in the crypt of the new sanctuary and displayed for veneration by the pilgrims.

The town of Pietrelcina, where Padre Pio grew up, is another pilgrimage site which became popular among devotees. The sites which can be visited by pilgrims in Pietrelcina include Pio&#x27;s family house where he was born, his room in an ancient tower in which he stayed as a friar when he was ill, the Santa Anna Church where he was baptized, the Santa Maria degli Angeli Church, where he was ordained a deacon prior to becoming a priest, and the Capuchin Church of the Holy Family. It is estimated that around two million pilgrims come to Pietrelcina every year.

Sanctuaries and places dedicated to the veneration of Padre Pio outside Italy include the Padre Pio Shrine in Santo Tomas, Batangas in the Philippines and the National Center for Padre Pio in Barto, Pennsylvania, in the United States.

===Veneration by the popes===
Popes have encouraged popular devotion to Padre Pio in various ways, notably by visiting the places associated with his life and ministry. San Giovanni Rotondo, where Padre Pio spent most of his life and where his shrine is located, was visited by Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. Pietrelcina, Padre Pio&#x27;s birthplace, was visited by Pope Francis.

Pope John Paul II had much admiration for Padre Pio even before he became Pope, when Padre Pio was still alive. In 1947, as a young priest studying in Rome, Karol Wojtyła made a pilgrimage to San Giovanni Rotondo to meet Padre Pio in person. He returned to San Giovanni Rotondo as a cardinal, in 1974. He visited San Giovanni Rotondo again in May 1987 as Pope John Paul II, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Padre Pio&#x27;s birth.

On 21 June 2009, Pope Benedict XVI visited San Giovanni Rotondo as a pastoral visit. He visited the Santa Maria delle Grazie Church to venerate of the relics of Padre Pio in the crypt, celebrated Mass and met with various people, including with the sick and the employees of the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza.

Pope Francis has also supported popular devotion to Padre Pio. During the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, he requested that Padre Pio&#x27;s relics be exposed for veneration in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica from 8 to 14 February 2016 and he especially honoured Padre Pio as a &quot;saint-confessors&quot; to inspire people to resort to the sacrament of Penance during the Jubilee. On 17 March 2018, Pope Francis visited both Pietrelcina and San Giovanni Rotondo to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Padre Pio&#x27;s death.

===Exhumation===

On 3 March 2008, the body of Pio was exhumed from his crypt, forty years after his death, so that his remains could be prepared for display. A church statement described the body as being in &quot;fair condition&quot;. Archbishop Domenico Umberto D&#x27;Ambrosio, Papal legate to the shrine in San Giovanni Rotondo, stated &quot;the top part of the skull is partly skeletal but the chin is perfect and the rest of the body is well preserved&quot;. Archbishop D&#x27;Ambrosio also confirmed in a communiqué that &quot;the stigmata are not visible&quot;. He said that Pio&#x27;s hands &quot;looked like they had just undergone a manicure&quot;. It was hoped that morticians would be able to restore the face so that it would be recognizable. However, because of its deterioration, his face was covered with a lifelike silicone mask. This mask was made from a 1968 photograph of Padre Pio&#x27;s body by the London-based Gems Studio, which usually works for wax museums and ethnological museums.

Cardinal José Saraiva Martins, Prefect for the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, celebrated Mass for 15,000 devotees on 24 April at the Shrine of Holy Mary of Grace, San Giovanni Rotondo, before the body went on display in a crystal, marble, and silver sepulcher in the crypt of the monastery. Padre Pio is wearing his brown Capuchin habit with a white silk stole embroidered with crystals and gold thread. His hands hold a large wooden cross. 800,000 pilgrims worldwide, mostly from Italy, made reservations to view the body up to December 2008, but only 7,200 people a day were able to file past the crystal coffin. Officials extended the display through September 2009.

Pio&#x27;s remains were placed in the church of Saint Pio, which is beside San Giovanni Rotondo. In April 2010 they were moved to a special golden crypt.

===Prayer groups===
Padre Pio&#x27;s prayer groups began in the 1950s when Pope Pius XII called to form groups gathering monthly to pray together. Padre Pio responded to this call and encouraged his devotees to form such groups. The groups were associated with the construction of the &quot;Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza&quot;, with a biweekly bulletin named after the hospital and published from 1949, which helped these groups develop. In 1951, the first statutes of the prayer groups were codified. The prayer groups gathered monthly, with the agreement of the local bishop and under the guidance of a priest, to pray for the pope and for Padre Pio&#x27;s ministries. New statutes were formally approved by the Vatican in 1986. Padre Pio&#x27;s prayer groups are coordinated from their headquarters in the &quot;Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza&quot;.

The prayer groups kept growing during Padre Pio&#x27;s life and after his death. In 1968 at Padre Pio&#x27;s death, there were around 700 groups, with 68,000 members in 15 countries. In 2013, there were approximately 3,300 registered groups in 60 countries, with about 75% of those groups based in Italy and 25% outside of Italy, mainly in France, Ireland and the United States.

=== Worldwide devotion ===

Padre Pio has become one of the world&#x27;s most popular saints. There are more than 3,000 &quot;Padre Pio Prayer Groups&quot; worldwide, with three million members. The first St Padre Pio parish in the world was established on 16 June 2002 in Kleinburg, Ontario, Canada. There are parishes in Vineland and Lavallette, New Jersey, and Sydney, Australia, and shrines in Buena, New Jersey, and Santo Tomas, Batangas, Philippines, dedicated to Padre Pio. A 2006 survey by the magazine &quot;Famiglia Cristiana&quot; found that more Italian Catholics pray to Padre Pio for intercession than to any other figure.

In 2002, a few months after the canonization of Padre Pio, a new TV station was launched in Italy dedicated to his life and devotion, named Padre Pio TV. It is based at San Giovanni Rotondo and broadcasts on its own website and various internet platforms.

The remains of Saint Pio were brought to the Vatican for veneration during the 2015–2016 Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy. Saint Pio and Saint Leopold Mandic were designated as saint-confessors to inspire people to become reconciled to the Church and to God, by the confession of their sins.

Saint Pio of Pietrelcina was named the patron saint of civil defence volunteers after a group of 160 petitioned the Italian Bishops&#x27; Conference for this designation. The bishops forwarded the request to the Vatican, which gave its approval to the designation. He is also &quot;less officially&quot; known as the patron saint of stress relief and the January blues&quot;, after the Catholic Enquiry Office in London proclaimed him as such. They designated the most depressing day of the year, identified as the Monday closest to January 22, as &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Be Happy Day&quot;, in honor of Padre Pio&#x27;s famous advice: &quot;Pray, hope, and don&#x27;t worry.&quot;

Some of Padre Pio&#x27;s relics toured Northern Ireland in 2022 and Scotland in 2023.

===Iconography===
Padre Pio&#x27;s iconography has been widely reproduced on devotional items and statues throughout Italy and the world, even before his beatification and canonization. His portrait can be seen in Italy in many churches as well as in private homes and public places, such as shops and restaurants. In religious art, he is usually depicted in his brown Capuchin habit with gloves covering his stigmata.

Statues of Padre Pio have been erected in Italy and in other countries, including in the United States, the Philippines and Malta. In the St. Padre Pio Shrine in Landisville, New Jersey, there is a statue of Padre Pio built in and imported from Italy. A statue of Pio in Messina, Sicily, attracted attention in 2002 when it supposedly wept tears of blood. In Italy, near the coast of the Capraia island in the Mediterranean Sea, there is an underwater statue of Padre Pio at 40 feet (12,19 meters) deep, submerged in 1998.

In 2021, the construction of a new sanctuary dedicated to Padre Pio started on a hill overlooking Cebu City, in the Philippines, with a 100-foot-tall statue of Padre Pio. The same year a statue of Padre Pio was inaugurated in the Padre Pio Shrine in Santo Tomas, Batangas, Philippines.

<text>Marie Laurencin (31 October 1883 – 8 June 1956) was a French painter and printmaker. She became an important figure in the Parisian avant-garde as a member of the Cubists associated with the Section d&#x27;Or.

==Biography==
Laurencin was born in Paris, where she was raised by her mother and lived there for much of her life. At 18, she studied porcelain painting in Sèvres. She then returned to Paris and continued her art education at the Académie Humbert, where she changed her focus to oil painting.

During the early years of the 20th century, Laurencin was an important figure in the Parisian avant-garde. A member of both the circle of Pablo Picasso, and Cubists associated with the Section d&#x27;Or, such as Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri le Fauconnier, and Francis Picabia, exhibiting with them at the Salon des Indépendants (1910–1911) and the Salon d&#x27;Automne (1911–1912), and Galeries Dalmau (1912) at the first Cubist exhibition in Spain. She became romantically involved with the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, and has often been identified as his muse. In addition, Laurencin had important connections to the salon of the American expatriate and lesbian writer Natalie Clifford Barney. She had relationships with men and women, and her art reflected her life, her &quot;balletic wraiths&quot; and &quot;sidesaddle Amazons&quot; providing the art world with her brand of &quot;queer femme with a Gallic twist.&quot; She had a forty years long love relationship with fashion designer .

During the First World War, Laurencin left France for exile in Spain with her German-born husband, the artist, Baron Otto von Waëtjen, since through her marriage she had automatically lost her French citizenship. The couple subsequently lived together briefly in Düsseldorf. She was greatly affected by her separation from the French capital, the unrivaled center of artistic creativity. After they divorced in 1920, she returned to Paris, where she achieved financial success as an artist until the economic depression of the 1930s. During the 1930s she worked as an art instructor at a private school. She lived in Paris until her death.

==Work==
Laurencin&#x27;s works include paintings, watercolors, drawings, and prints. She is known as one of the few female Cubist painters, with Sonia Delaunay, Marie Vorobieff, and Franciska Clausen. While her work shows the influence of Cubist painters Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who was her close friend, she developed a unique approach to abstraction which often centered on the representation of groups of women and animals. Her work lies outside the bounds of Cubist norms in her pursuit of a specifically feminine aesthetic by her use of pastel colors and curvilinear forms. Originally influenced by Fauvism, she simplified her forms through the influence of the Cubist painters. From 1910, her palette consisted mainly of grey, pink, and pastel tones.

Her distinctive style developed upon her return to Paris in the 1920s post exile. The muted colours and the geometric patterns inherited from Cubism were replaced by light tones and undulating compositions. Her signature motif is marked by willowy, ethereal female figures, and a palette of soft pastel colours, evoking an enchanted world. Art history professor Libby Otto said, &quot;Marie Laurencin is of the &#x27;lipstick lesbian&#x27; variety: She constructs this very soft, feminine world that really spoke to viewers at the time. And if you realize that, in her soft way, she&#x27;s constructing a world without men, of female harmony, there&#x27;s something pretty revolutionary in there as well.&quot;

Laurencin continued to explore themes of femininity and what she considered to be feminine modes of representation until her death. Her works include paintings, watercolors, drawings, and prints.

==Collections==
Laurencin&#x27;s artistic accomplishments are seen in collections around the world. On the 100th anniversary of her birth in 1983, the Musée Marie Laurencin opened in Nagano, Japan. To date, the Musée Marie Laurencin is the only museum in the world that solely contains the art of a female painter. Founder Masahiro Takano was enamored with Laurencin&#x27;s sensual and lyrical worldview, and the museum holds over 600 art pieces by her. 

Laurencin&#x27;s work is also found in The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and the Tate Gallery in London. Her work is also shown in the permanent collection of the Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie gallery in Paris, France, housing some of her most famous pieces.

In 2023, the Barnes Foundation opened a retrospective of Laurencin&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Marie Laurencin: Sapphic Paris.&quot;

<doc id="320351" wikidata="Q1165892" url="?curid=320351" title="Hypodermic needle">
<text>A hypodermic needle (from Greek ὑπο- (&quot;hypo-&quot; = under), and δέρμα (&quot;derma&quot; = skin)) is a very thin, hollow tube with one sharp tip. It is one of a category of medical tools which enter the skin, called sharps. It is commonly used with a syringe, a hand-operated device with a plunger, to inject substances into the body (e.g., saline solution, solutions containing various drugs or liquid medicines) or extract fluids from the body (e.g., blood). Large-bore hypodermic intervention is especially useful in catastrophic blood loss or treating shock.

A hypodermic needle is used for rapid delivery of liquids, or when the injected substance cannot be ingested, either because it would not be absorbed (as with insulin), or because it would harm the liver. It is also useful to deliver certain medications that cannot be delivered orally due to vomiting. There are many possible routes for an injection, with intramuscular (into a muscle) and intravenous (into a vein) being the most common. A hypodermic syringe has the ability to retain liquid and blood in it up to years after the last use and a great deal of caution should be taken to use a new syringe every time.

The hypodermic needle also serves an important role in research environments where sterile conditions are required. The hypodermic needle significantly reduces contamination during inoculation of a sterile substrate. The hypodermic needle reduces contamination for two reasons: First, its surface is extremely smooth, which prevents airborne pathogens from becoming trapped between irregularities on the needle&#x27;s surface, which would subsequently be transferred into the media (e.g. agar) as contaminants; second, the needle&#x27;s surface is extremely sharp, which significantly reduces the diameter of the hole remaining after puncturing the membrane and consequently prevents microbes larger than this hole from contaminating the substrate.

==History==

===Early use and experimentation===
The ancient Greeks and Romans knew injection as a method of medicinal delivery from observations of snakebites and poisoned weapons. There are also references to &quot;anointing&quot; and &quot;inunction&quot; in the Old Testament as well as the works of Homer, but injection as a legitimate medical tool was not truly explored until the 17th century.

Christopher Wren performed the earliest confirmed experiments with crude hypodermic needles, performing intravenous injection into dogs in 1656. These experiments consisted of using animal bladders (as the syringe) and goose quills (as the needle) to administer drugs such as opium intravenously to dogs. Wren and others&#x27; main interest was to learn if medicines traditionally administered orally would be effective intravenously. In the 1660s, Johann Daniel Major of Kiel and Johann Sigismund Elsholtz of Berlin were the first to experiment with injections in humans.

===19th-century development===

The 19th century saw the development of medicines that were effective in small doses, such as opiates and strychnine. This spurred a renewed interest in direct, controlled application of medicine. &quot;Some controversy surrounds the question of priority in hypodermic medication.&quot; Irish physician Francis Rynd is generally credited with the first successful injection in 1844, in the Meath Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

Alexander Wood&#x27;s main contribution was the all-glass syringe in 1851, which allowed the user to estimate dosage based on the levels of liquid observed through the glass. Wood used hypodermic needles and syringes primarily for the application of localized, subcutaneous injection (localized anesthesia) and therefore was not as interested in precise dosages.

Simultaneous to Wood&#x27;s work in Edinburgh, Charles Pravaz of Lyon also experimented with sub-dermal injections in sheep using a syringe of his own design. Pravaz designed a hypodermic needle measuring 3 cm (1.18 in) long and 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter; it was made entirely of silver.

Charles Hunter, a London surgeon, is credited with the coining of the term &quot;hypodermic&quot; to describe subcutaneous injection in 1858. The name originates from two Greek words: &quot;hypo&quot;, &quot;under&quot;, and &quot;derma&quot;, &quot;skin&quot;. Furthermore, Hunter is credited with acknowledging the systemic effects of injection after noticing that a patient&#x27;s pain was alleviated regardless of the injection&#x27;s proximity to the pained area. Hunter and Wood were involved in a lengthy dispute over not only the origin of the modern hypodermic needle, but also because of their disagreement as to the medicine&#x27;s effect once administered.

===Modern improvements===
Dr. Francis Rynd used the first &quot;Hollow Needle&quot; as a hypodermic syringe on Ms. Margaret Cox in Ireland on June 3rd, 1844. Dr. Wood can be largely credited with the popularization and acceptance of injection as a medical technique, as well as the widespread use and acceptance of the hypodermic needle. The basic technology of the hypodermic needle has stayed largely unchanged since the 19th century, but as the years progressed and medical and chemical knowledge improved, small refinements have been made to increase safety and efficacy, with needles being designed and tailored for very particular uses. Hypodermic needles remain essential to large volume administration or exchange in settings of trauma or dialysis. The trend of needle specification for use began in the 1920s, particularly for the administration of insulin to diabetics.

The onset of World War II spurred the early development of partially disposable syringes for the administration of morphine and penicillin on the battlefield. Development of the fully disposable hypodermic needle was spurred on in the 1950s for several reasons. The Korean War created blood shortages and in response disposable, sterile syringes were developed for collecting blood. The widespread immunization against polio during the period required the development of a fully disposable syringe system.

The 1950s also saw the rise and recognition of cross-contamination from used needles. This led to the development of the first fully disposable plastic syringe by New Zealand pharmacist Colin Murdoch in 1956. This period also marked a shift in interest from needle specifications to general sterility and safety.

The 1980s saw the rise of the HIV epidemic and with it renewed concern over the safety of cross-contamination from used needles. New safety controls were designed on disposable needles to ensure the safety of medical workers in particular. These controls were implemented on the needles themselves, such as retractable needles, but also in the handling of used needles, particularly in the use of hard-surface disposal receptacles found in every medical office today.

By 2008, all-plastic needles were in production and in limited use. One version was made of Vectra (plastic) aromatic liquid crystal polymer tapered from 1.2 mm at the hub to 0.72 mm at the tip (equivalent to 22 gauge metal needle), with an ID/OD ratio of 70%.

==Manufacture==
Hypodermic needles are normally made from a stainless-steel or Niobium tube through a process known as tube drawing where the tube is drawn through progressively smaller dies to make the needle. The end of the needle is bevelled to create a sharp pointed tip, letting the needle easily penetrate the skin.
==Gauge==
The main system for measuring the diameter of a hypodermic needle is the Birmingham gauge (also known as the Stubs Iron Wire Gauge); the French gauge is used mainly for catheters. Various needle lengths are available for any given gauge. Needles in common medical use range from 7 gauge (the largest) to 34 (the smallest). 21-gauge needles are most commonly used for drawing blood for testing purposes, and 16- or 17-gauge needles are most commonly used for blood donation, as the larger luminal cross-sectional area results in lower fluid shear, reducing harm to red blood cells while also allowing more blood to be collected in a shorter time.

Although reusable needles remain useful for some scientific applications, disposable needles are far more common in medicine. Disposable needles are embedded in a plastic or aluminium hub that attaches to the syringe barrel by means of a press-fit or twist-on fitting. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;Luer Lock&quot; connections, referring to the trademark Luer-Lok. The male and female luer lock and hub—produced by pharmaceutical equipment manufacturers—are two of the most critical parts of disposable hypodermic needles.

==Use by non-specialists==
Hypodermic needles are usually used by medical professionals (dentists, phlebotomists, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, paramedics), but they are sometimes used by patients themselves. This is most common with type one diabetics, who may require several insulin injections a day. It also occurs with patients who have asthma or other severe allergies. Such patients may need to take desensitization injections or they may need to carry injectable medicines to use for first aid in case of a severe allergic reaction. In the latter case, such patients often carry a syringe loaded with epinephrine (e.g. EpiPen), diphenhydramine (e.g. Benadryl), or dexamethasone. Rapid injection of one of these drugs may stop a severe allergic reaction.

Multiple sclerosis patients may also treat themselves by injection; several MS therapies, including various interferon preparations, are designed to be self-administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. 

Transgender people may also inject their own hormone replacement therapy, using either intramuscular injection or subcutaneous injection methods.

Hypodermic needles are also used for erotic piercing.

==Phobia==

It is estimated that anywhere from nearly 3.5 to 10% of the world&#x27;s population may have a phobia of needles (trypanophobia), and it is much more common in children, ages 5–17. Topical anesthetics can be used to desensitize the area where the injection will take place to reduce pain and discomfort. For children, various techniques may be effective at reducing distress or pain related to needles. Techniques include: distraction, hypnosis, combined cognitive behavioral therapy, and breathing techniques.

<text>A blood-borne disease is a disease that can be spread through contamination by blood and other body fluids. Blood can contain pathogens of various types, chief among which are microorganisms, like bacteria and parasites, and non-living infectious agents such as viruses. Three blood-borne pathogens in particular, all viruses, are cited as of primary concern to health workers by the CDC-NIOSH: human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

Diseases that are not usually transmitted directly by blood contact, but rather by insect or other vector, are more usefully classified as vector-borne disease, even though the causative agent can be found in blood. Vector-borne diseases include West Nile virus, zika fever and malaria.

Many blood-borne diseases can also be contracted by other means, including high-risk sexual behavior or intravenous drug use. These diseases have also been identified in sports medicine.

Since it is difficult to determine what pathogens any given sample of blood contains, and some blood-borne diseases are lethal, standard medical practice regards all blood (and any body fluid) as potentially infectious. &quot;Blood and body fluid precautions&quot; are a type of infection control practice that seeks to minimize this sort of disease transmission.

== Emerging blood-borne pathogens ==
While well-known blood-borne diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C continue to be of major concern, new and emerging pathogens are also being identified. These include:
# Zika Virus – although primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, Zika virus has been detected in blood transfusions, raising concerns about its potential as a blood-borne pathogen.
# Ebola Virus – the Ebola virus can be transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, particularly in healthcare settings. Studies suggest that survivors may carry the virus for months.
# Babesia microti – a parasite causing babesiosis, which is transmitted via tick bites but has also been found in blood transfusions, leading to increased screening measures.
# HTLV-1 (Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1) – a retrovirus that affects white blood cells and is linked to adult T-cell leukemia, myelopathy, and other neurological disorders.

== Global epidemiology and statistics ==
Blood-borne diseases pose significant global health challenges, especially in regions with limited healthcare access. Recent Statistics include:

* HIV/AIDS: as of 2023, approximately 39.9 million people globally were living with HIV infection in 2023.
* Hepatitis B: 2.4 million people are chronically infected in United States.
* Hepatitis C: approximately 50 million people are infected with hepatitis C worldwide, with about 1 million new infections annually.

== Occupational exposure ==
Blood poses the greatest threat to health in a laboratory or clinical setting due to needlestick injuries (&quot;e.g.&quot;, lack of proper needle disposal techniques and/or safety syringes). Needles are not the only issue, as direct splashes of blood also cause transmission. These risks are greatest among healthcare workers, including: nurses, surgeons, laboratory assistants, doctors, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians. These roles often require the use of syringes for blood draws or to administer medications.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) prescribes 5 rules that are required for a healthcare facility to follow in order to reduce the risk of employee exposure to blood-borne pathogens. They are:
* Written exposure control plan
* Engineering controls (Sharps containers, detachable and retractable needles, syringe caps, etc.)
* Safe work practices and safety devices
* Hepatitis B vaccine available to employees
* Education and post-exposure follow up
These controls, while general, serve to greatly reduce the incidence of blood-borne disease transmission in occupational settings of healthcare workers.

There are 26 different viruses that have been shown to present in healthcare workers as a result of occupational exposure. The most common blood-borne diseases are hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. Exposure is possible through blood of an infected patient splashing onto mucous membranes; however, the greatest exposure risk was shown to occur during percutaneous injections performed for vascular access. These include blood draws, as well as catheter placement, as both typically use hollow bore needles. Preventive measures for occupational exposure include standard precautions (hand washing, sharp disposal containers), as well as additional education. Advancements in the design of safety engineered devices have played a significant role in decreasing rates of occupational exposure to blood-borne disease. According to the Massachusetts Sharps Injury Surveillance System, needle devices without safety features accounted for 53% of the 2010 reported sharps injuries. Safer sharps devices now have engineering controls, such as a protective shield over the needle, and sharps containers that have helped to decrease this statistic. These safer alternatives are highly effective in substantially reducing injuries. For instance, almost 83% of injuries from hollow bore needles can be prevented with the use of safer sharps devices. There have been reports of HCW transferring disease to patients. This happens usually when surgeons perform using these sharps as well.

== Advances in detection and prevention ==

* Next-Generation Sequencing: advanced genomic sequencing techniques are improving early detection of blood borne pathogens.
* Point of Care Testing: rapid diagnostic tests for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C now provide results within minutes, expanding screening in remote areas.
* CRISPR based diagnostics: gene editing technology is being researched for rapid and highly sensitive detection of viral RNA in blood samples.
* Universal Pathogen Inactivation: technologies are being developed to inactivate viruses and bacteria in donated blood, reducing transmission risks.

== Blood transfusions ==

Blood for blood transfusion is screened for many blood-borne diseases. Additionally, a technique that uses a combination of riboflavin and UV light to inhibit the replication of these pathogens by altering their nucleic acids can be used to treat blood components prior to their transfusion, and can reduce the risk of disease transmission.

A technology using the synthetic psoralen (amotosalen HCl) and UVA light (320–400 nm) has been implemented in European blood centers for the treatment of platelet and plasma components to prevent transmission of blood-borne diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and protozoa.

== Needle exchange programs ==
Needle exchange programs (NEPs) are an attempt to reduce the spread of blood-borne diseases between intravenous drug users. They often also provide addiction counseling services, infectious disease testing, and in some cases mental health care and other case management. NEPs acquired their name as they were initially places where intravenous (IV) illicit substance users were provided with clean, unused needles in exchange for their used needles. This allows for proper disposal of the needles. Empirical studies confirm the benefits of NEPs. NEPs can affect behaviors that result in the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. These behaviors include decreased sharing of used syringes, which reduces contaminated syringes from circulation and replaces them with sterile ones, among other risk reductions.

== Prevention ==
Follow standard precautions to help prevent the spread of blood-borne pathogens and other diseases whenever there is a risk of exposure to blood or other bodily fluids. Standard precautions include maintaining personal hygiene and using personal protective equipment (PPE), engineering controls, and work practice controls among others. Always avoid contact with blood and other bodily fluids. Wear disposable gloves when providing care, particularly if you may come into contact with blood or bodily fluids. Dispose of gloves properly and change gloves when providing care to a new patient. Use needles with safety devices to help prevent needlestick injury and exposure to blood-borne pathogens. It is also recommended healthcare workers who come often in contact with contaminated material should get vaccinated against hepatitis B. A hierarchy of controls can help to prevent environmental and occupational exposures and subsequent diseases. These include:
* Elimination: Physically remove hazards, including needles that lack a safety device. Additionally, eliminate the use of needle devices whenever safe and effective alternatives are available.
* Substitution: Replace needles without safety devices with ones that have a safety feature built in. This has been shown to reduce blood-borne diseases transmitted via needlestick injuries.
* Engineering controls: Isolate people from the hazard by providing sharps containers for workers to immediately place needles in after use, which means putting them within arm&#x27;s reach of wherever patient treatment occurs, such as in every physician&#x27;s exam room, every draw station in a medical lab, and every bedside in a hospital ward or wing.
* Administrative controls: Change the way people work by creating a culture of safety such as avoiding recapping or bending needles that may be contaminated and promptly disposing of used needle devices and other sharps.

Personal protective equipment: Protect workers with PPE such as gloves and masks to avoid transmission of blood and other bodily fluids.

There have been reports of HCW transferring disease to patients. This happens usually when surgeons perform EPPs, which are procedures requiring sharp tools.

<text>Sandy is a town and civil parish in Central Bedfordshire, England. It lies to the east of Bedford, to the south west of Cambridge and north of Central London. It had a population of 12,171 at the 2021 census.

The town takes its name from a low range of sandy hills on the eastern side of the town, which form part of the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge. The main part of the built-up area lies between the hills to the east and the River Ivel to the west. The A1 road skirts the western edge of the town. Sandy railway station is on the Great Northern route between London and Peterborough, with the railway running along the eastern edge of the built-up area. The parish also includes the hamlet of Beeston, which straddles the A1 to the south-west of the town.

The headquarters of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is at The Lodge at Sandy Warren in the hills to the east of the town, where it has been based since 1961.

== History ==
The Sandy area has a long history of occupation, with evidence found for settlement prior to 250BC. Sandy was a Roman settlement, when it was probably an important trading centre and staging post. An ancient hill fort, now heavily wooded and traditionally known as Caesar&#x27;s Camp, although more commonly called &quot;the sand hills&quot; or &quot;the lookout&quot;, still overlooks the town.

Sandy is referred to in the Domesday Book of 1086, as Sandeia, a derivation from the Old English Sandieg, meaning a sand-island. At that time it was part of the ancient hundred of Weneslawe and was held by Eudo Fitzhubert, who is likely to have been the tenant. He was probably also known as Eudo Dapifer, who was a high steward for William the Conqueror, and based in Colchester Castle.

There were two mills listed in Sandy in the Domesday Book, which would have been water-powered. One of these mills is likely to have been at Sandy Mill on the River Ivel to the south-west of the town. This was at the end of Mill Lane, adjoining The Riddy, which is now a local nature reserve. There was a water mill on this site from at least the Norman era. The last mill on the site was built in 1857. Milling continued into the twentieth century, with the last mill buildings eventually being demolished in 1977 and replaced with housing. Further down the river from the mill it is believed there was a Danish camp which was built to protect the Danelaw in 886.

The half-hundred of Weneslawe contained Sandy and 3 additional parishes during the Domesday survey; before Kirby&#x27;s Quest (1284–86) this half-hundred was merged into the Hundred of Biggleswade. In 1831 the old Weneslawe parishes were listed as Sandy, Sutton, Potton, Hatley, and additionally Everton. A route for a scenic and historic Weneslawe Walk around Sandy, Potton, and Biggleswade was promoted in 2022.
Sandy&#x27;s parish church of St Swithun was largely rebuilt in 1860, but retaining some of the medieval building, including the tower.
Sandy remained a village into the twentieth century. The central public space is called Market Square, but Sandy was not a market town as such; it was not until 1925 that it was formally given the right to hold a market. Sandy Town Hall was built in 1906 on Bedford Road. This was a large hall built by a private company for public events rather than a being a town hall in the sense of a council&#x27;s headquarters.

The town expanded rapidly in the 1970s with the development of London overspill housing between Sunderland Road and St Neots Road. This expansion continued into the 1990s with new housing developments at Fallow Field and Ivel Park.

== Governance ==

There are two tiers of local government covering Sandy, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Sandy Town Council and Central Bedfordshire Council. The town council is based at 10 Cambridge Road.

===Administrative history===
Sandy was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894, Sandy was given a parish council and included in the wider Biggleswade Rural District. In 1895 Sandy Parish Council established a council chamber in a room at the fire station at 10 Cambridge Road, which had been built in 1882.
In 1927 the parish of Sandy was made an urban district, making it independent from the Biggleswade Rural District. The urban district council continued to meet at the fire station until 1946, when it bought Boyne House at 7 St Neots Road and converted it to become its offices and meeting place.

Sandy Urban District was abolished in 1974 to become part of Mid Bedfordshire. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district. The re-established parish council declared the parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot; and appoint a mayor. In 1978 the town council left Boyne House and returned to 10 Cambridge Road, this time taking over the whole building; the fire station had moved to a new building on Ivel Road in 1954. Mid Bedfordshire in turn was abolished in 2009 to become part of Central Bedfordshire.

===Constituency===
Sandy is within the parliamentary constituency of North Bedfordshire.

== Geography==
Sandy is north of Central London with the county town of Bedford to the west. St Neots, Cambridgeshire lies to the north with Biggleswade to the south.

The River Ivel, a tributary of the River Great Ouse, runs through the town. Parts of the town and adjoining land are designated as a Flood Warning Area. The Greensand Ridge, an escarpment which runs through Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and Cambridgeshire, runs to the south and east of the town.

The Sandy Heath transmitting station, a 244 metre tall television broadcast mast, is located to the east of the town.

== Transport ==
===Road===
Sandy is situated on the A1 which hugs the western edge of the town. The A603 leads west towards Bedford; the B1042 leads east towards Potton and Cambridge.

The original route of the A1 did not go through the centre of Sandy, but passed through the Girtford area on the west side of the town, crossing the Ivel at Girtford Bridge. The A1 bypass was one of the earlier 1950s improvements on the Great North Road. The bypass required a new bridge over the River Ivel, built by Dorman Long. The roundabout (former traffic lights before the late 1970s) is with the A603 for Bedford, to the west and the B1042 into Sandy itself and on to Potton and Cambridge. The former A603, to the east is now the B1042. The former north–south route through the town was over Girtford Bridge, to the west of the current route, and now the A603. There were three separate bypass schemes – the Improvement from Sandy to the junction with A428 (Tempsford and Tempsford Bridge Diversions, began December 1957, finished around 1960), Provision of second carriageway (widening) through Girtford (began 2 January 1961, finished around October 1962), and Biggleswade by-pass to Girtford (Girtford Diversion, which opened on 6 August 1961 which included pulverised fuel ash as an embankment infill material). The Girtford Underpass was built in the early 1990s by Kimbell Construction, at the former Varsity Line railway bridge.

South of the Sandy roundabout the A1 still follows its historic route through the hamlets of Beeston and Seddington, which are in the parish of Sandy. Proposals have been put forward at various times for a bypass, but none have come to fruition.

===Rail===

Sandy railway station is located on the East Coast Main Line and provides half-hourly trains south to central London and beyond to Horsham, and north to Peterborough. Journey times to London are typically around 40 minutes. The station is managed and served by Thameslink and Great Northern.

====Past and future rail links====

The Varsity Line, which connected Oxford to Cambridge, ran through Sandy until 1967. Girtford Halt was a short-lived station on the Varsity Line in the Girtford area of the town between 1938 and 1940. From Bedford to Sandy, the line has been paved over and is now part of the NCR 51 cycle route.

In January 2020, East West Rail Ltd, which exists to re-establish the OxfordCambridge rail link, announced a new route between Bedford and Cambridge that will bypass Sandy, with a new station &#x27;in the Tempsford area&#x27;.

===Bus===
The no.73 Stagecoach East bus service, runs half-hourly Monday - Saturday between Biggleswade, Sandy and Bedford. No Sunday service.

==Sport and leisure==
Sandy has an amateur football team, Sandy F.C., who compete in Division One of the Bedfordshire County Football League.

An athletics track, located at Sandy Secondary School, is home to Biggleswade Athletic Club.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the nearby Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

Sandy&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio on 95.5 FM, Heart East on 96.9 FM and BigglesFM is a licensed community radio station transmitting from nearby Potton on 104.8 FM and online. Full-time broadcasting began in April 2011.

The town is served by the local newspaper, The Biggleswade Chronicle.

==Education==
Schools in Sandy were previously 3 tier (lower, middle and upper) as per the rest of the schools in Central Bedfordshire. However, from 2018 schools in the town have converted to being 2 tier (primary and secondary). Due to these changes Sandye Place Academy (the middle school in Sandy) closed in September 2019.

* Maple Tree Primary School
* Robert Peel Primary School
* St Swithun&#x27;s CE Primary School

== Twinned towns ==
Sandy has been twinned with the town of Malaunay in France since 1982, as a result of which the Sandy Twinning Association was also established. The association has also recently developed links with the town of Skarszewy in Poland.

==Commemoration==
Frederick Thomas Bidlake is commemorated by a garden and monument, at Girtford Bridge. It was unveiled on 23 September 1934 as more than 4,000 watched W. P. Cook, president of the Anfield Bicycle Club and the Road Records Association, perform the unveiling ceremony. The rector of Sandy blessed the memorial. The garden is triangular with a wall of local stone on one side. In its centre, a stone reads: &quot;This garden is dedicated to Frederick Thomas Bidlake, a great cyclist, a man of singular charm and character, an untiring worker for cyclists 1867–1933&quot;. A sundial in the centre of the garden is marked &quot;He measured time&quot;. A facsimile milestone is engraved &quot;F. T. B. Few have known this road as he. London 48 – York 148&quot;.

Girtford Bridge itself was built in 1780–82 to the designs of the Rutland architect John Wing (1728–1794) assisted by his son John Wing (1756–1826)

There is a statue of Victoria Cross recipient William Peel in the south transept of St Swithun&#x27;s Church. Opposite the church across the High Street stands the Sir William Peel pub.

<doc id="320364" wikidata="Q2738848" url="?curid=320364" title="Trampling (sexual practice)">
<text>Trampling is a sexual activity that involves being trampled underfoot by another person or persons. Trampling is common enough to support a subgenre of trampling pornography.

Because trampling can be used to produce pain, the trampling fetish for some adherents is closely linked to sadomasochistic fetishism.

A similar fetish is to imagine themselves as being tiny under another&#x27;s feet, or being normal size, but being trampled by a giant person. This is known as &quot;giant/giantess fetishism&quot; or macrophilia. It is not the same as trampling.

Trampling is usually done barefooted, in socks, nylons, or shoes. The trampler will predominantly walk, jump and stomp on the person&#x27;s back and chest.

<text>Georg Brandt (26 June 1694 – 29 April 1768) was a Swedish chemist and mineralogist who discovered cobalt c. 1735. He was the first person to discover a metal unknown in ancient times. He is also known for exposing fraudulent alchemists operating during his lifetime.

==Biography==
Brandt was born in Riddarhyttan, Skinnskatteberg parish, Västmanland to Jurgen Brandt, a mineowner and pharmacist, and Katarina Ysing. He was professor of chemistry at Uppsala University, and died in Stockholm. He was able to show that cobalt was the source of the blue color in glass, which previously had been attributed to the bismuth found with cobalt. He died on 29 April 1768 of prostate cancer.

About 1741 he wrote: &quot;As there are six kinds of metals, so I have also shown with reliable experiments... that there are also six kinds of half-metals: a new half-metal, namely Cobalt regulus in addition to Mercury, Bismuth, Zinc, and the reguluses of Antimony and Arsenic&quot;. He gave six ways to distinguish bismuth and cobalt which were typically found in the same ores:

#Bismuth fractures while Cobalt is more like a true metal.
#The regulus of Shetz fuses with flint and fixed alkali giving a blue glass known as zaffera, sasre, or smalt. Bismuth does not.
#Bismuth melts easily and if kept melted, calcinates forming a yellow powder.
#Bismuth amalgamates with Mercury; the regulus of Cobalt does not at all.
#Bismuth dissolved in nitric acid and with aqua regia and gives a white precipitate when put in pure water. The regulus of Cobalt needs alkalies to precipitate, and then forms dark or black precipitates.

<text>The geography of Tibet consists of the high mountains, lakes and rivers lying between Central, East and South Asia. Traditionally, Western (European and American) sources have regarded Tibet as being in Central Asia, though today&#x27;s maps show a trend toward considering all of modern China, including Tibet, to be part of East Asia. Tibet is often called &quot;the roof of the world,&quot; comprising tablelands averaging over 4,950 metres above the sea with peaks at 6,000 to 7,500 m, including Mount Everest, on the border with Nepal.

==Description==
It is bounded on the north and east by the Central China Plain and on the west and south by the Indian subcontinent (Ladakh, Spiti and Sikkim in India as well as Nepal and Bhutan). Most of Tibet sits atop a geological structure known as the Tibetan Plateau, which includes the Himalaya and many of the highest mountain peaks in the world.

High mountain peaks include Changtse, Lhotse, Makalu, Gauri Sankar, Gurla Mandhata, Cho Oyu, Jomolhari, Gyachung Kang, Gyala Peri, Mount Kailash, Kawagebo, Khumbutse, Melungtse, Mount Nyainqentanglha, Namcha Barwa, Shishapangma and Yangra.
Mountain passes include Cherko la and North Col. Smaller mountains include Mount Gephel and Gurla Mandhata.

==Regions==
Physically, Tibet may be divided into two parts, the &quot;lake region&quot; in the west and north-west and the &quot;river region&quot;, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south, and west. The region names are useful in contrasting their hydrological structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses which is nomadic in the &quot;lake region&quot; and agricultural in the &quot;river region&quot;. Despite its large size and mountainous nature, variation of climate across the Tibetan Plateau is more steady than abrupt. The &quot;river region&quot; has a subtropical highland climate with moderate summer rainfall averaging around per year, and daytime temperatures ranging from around in winter to in summer–though nights are as much as cooler. Rainfall decreases steadily to the west, reaching only at Leh on the edge of this region, whilst temperatures in winter become steadily colder. On the south the &quot;river region&quot; is bounded by the Himalayas, on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean – the Indus, Brahmaputra and Salween and its tributaries – and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.

The &quot;river region&quot; is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the Yarlung Tsangpo River (the upper courses of the Brahmaputra) and its major tributary, the Nyang River, the Salween, the Yangtze, the Mekong, and the Yellow River. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon, formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around Namcha Barwa, is the deepest, and possibly longest canyon in the world. Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.

The South Tibet Valley is formed by the Yarlung Zangbo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately 1200 kilometers long and 300 kilometers wide. The valley descends from 4500 meters above sea level to 2800 meters. The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around 5000 meters high. Lakes here include Lake Paiku and Lake Puma Yumco.

The &quot;lake region&quot; extends from the Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Lake Rakshastal, Yamdrok Lake and Lake Manasarovar near the source of the Indus River, to the sources of the Salween, the Mekong and the Yangtze. Other lakes include Dagze Co, Nam Co, and Pagsum Co. The lake region is an arid and wind-swept desert. This region is called the Chang Tang (Byang thang) or &#x27;Northern Plateau&#x27; by the people of Tibet. It is some 1100 km (700 mi) broad, and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to the extremely high mountain barriers it has a very arid alpine climate with annual precipitation around and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, separated by flat valleys. The country is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or alkaline, and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of discontinuous permafrost over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian tundra. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small effluent. The deposits consist of soda, potash, borax and common salt. The lake region is noted for a vast number of hot springs, which are widely distributed between the Himalaya and 34° N., but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (north-west of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.

==Climate==

The climate of Tibet is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only , due to the rain shadow effect. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where the wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.

===Climate data===

===The effects of climate change===
The Tibetan Plateau contains the world&#x27;s third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, said that the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term; but issued a strong warning:

&quot;Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world.&quot; &quot;In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows.&quot; &quot;In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines for Asian rivers, including the Indus and the Ganges. Once they vanish, water supplies in those regions will be in peril.&quot;

==Tibet during the last glacial period==

Today Tibet is the most essential heating surface of the atmosphere. During the Last glacial period a c. ice sheet covered the plateau. This glaciation took place in correspondence to a lowering of the snowline by . For the Last Glacial Maximum this means a depression of the average annual temperature by at a minor precipitation compared with that one of today.

Owing to this drop in temperature a supposed drier climate has partly been compensated with regard to the glacier feeding by a minor evaporation and an increased relative humidity.
Due to its great extension this glaciation in the subtropics was the most important climatically foreign element on earth. With an albedo about 80-90% this ice area of Tibet has reflected an at least 4 times greater global radiation energy per surface into space than the further inland ices at a higher geographical latitude. At that time the most essential heating surface of the atmosphere–which at present, i.e. interglacially, is the Tibetan plateau–was the most important cooling surface.

The annual low-pressure area induced by heat above Tibet as a motor of the summer monsoon was lacking. The glaciation thus caused a breaking-off of the summer monsoon with all the global-climatic consequences, e.g. the pluvials in the Sahara, the expansion of the Thar desert, the heavier dust influx into the Arabian Sea etc., and also the downward shifting of the timber line and all forest-belts from the alpine-boreal forests as far down as to the semi-humid mediterranean forest which has replaced the Holocene monsoon-tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent. But also the movements of animals including the Javan Rusa far into South Asia are a consequence of this glaciation.

Despite heavy ablation caused by heavy insolation, the discharge of the glaciers into the Inner-Asian basins was sufficient for the creation of meltwater lakes in the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin and the Gobi Desert. The drop in temperature (see above) was in favour of their development. Thus, the clay fraction produced by the ground scouring of the important glaciation was ready to be blown-out. The blow-out of the limnites and the Aeolian long-distance transport were connected to the katabatic winds. Accordingly, the Tibetan glaciation was the actual cause of the enormous loess production and the transport of the material into the Chinese middle- and lowlands continuing to the east. During the Ice Age the katabatic air current–the name &#x27;winter monsoon&#x27; is not quite correct–blew all year round.

The enormous uplift of Tibet by around 10 mm/year measured by triangulations since the 19th century and confirmed by glaciogemorphological findings as well as by seismological investigations equals the uplift of the Himalaya. However, these amounts of uplift are far too important as to a primarily tectonic uplift of the high plateau which only takes place epirogenetically. Actually they can be understood the better by a superimposed glacioisostatic compensation movement of Tibet about 650 m.

An alternative view held by some scientists is that the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have remained restricted over the entire data published since 1974 in the literature referred to in Kuhle (2004), which are relevant as to the maximum ice extent.

<text>Acquaintance rape is rape that is perpetrated by a person who knows the victim. Examples of acquaintances include someone the victim is dating, a classmate, co-worker, employer, family member, spouse, counselor, therapist, religious official, or medical doctor. Acquaintance rape includes a subcategory of incidents labeled date rape that involves people who are in romantic or sexual relationships with each other. When a rape is perpetrated by a college student on another student, the term campus rape is sometimes used.

Most rapes are perpetrated by a person known to the victim. However, acquaintance rape is less likely to be reported than stranger rape. Thus, crime statistics often underestimate the prevalence of acquaintance rape compared to national surveys. The legal consequences of acquaintance rape are the same as for stranger rape.

== Origin of the term ==
Studies distinguishing between stranger rape and those by a person known to the victim go back to the 1950s, when a study examining American police rape files from 1958 and 1960 found about half were alleged to have been committed by men who knew their victims. The phrase acquaintance rape was first used in print in 1982 by feminist writer and activist Diana Russell. She used it as an umbrella term to cover all rapes involving people who know one another, in her write-up of a study of 930 women in San Francisco in which she found that 35% reported having experienced rape or attempted rape by an acquaintance, compared with 11% who reported being raped by strangers. In 1988 American feminist writer Robin Warshaw published &quot;I Never Called It Rape&quot;, the first major book on acquaintance rape.

== Prevalence ==
Most rape is committed by someone the victim knows. In the United States, the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) has reported that 45 percent of sexual assaults are committed by an acquaintance and an additional 25 percent by a current or former intimate partner.

A 2004–05 study of 30 predominantly European countries by the United Nations Research Institute found about half of rape victims knew their rapists, over a third by name. 17% were a colleague or boss, 16% a close friend, 11% a former partner, and 7% a current partner. In a major 2009 European Commission study of rape cases across Europe, it was found that 67% of rapists were known to the victim, with most being a current or former partner. In Europe, the most common rape location is in the home of the victim or rapist.

In the U.S., acquaintance rape frequently takes the form of date rape or gang rape. A 1987 survey of 7,000 students at 25 schools found that one in four had been a victim of rape or attempted rape, and 84% of those knew their attacker. The same study found that 16% of male students who admitted rape, and 10% who admitted attempting it, said they had not been acting alone. In 1985 the Association of American Colleges published a report describing what were then called &quot;trains&quot;, in which multiple male students rape a woman who is incapacitated by drugs or alcohol. In a survey of 24 documented cases of alleged college gang rapes reported in the 1980s, 13 were perpetrated by fraternity members, nine by groups of athletes, and two by men unaffiliated with a formal group. In a U.S. National Women&#x27;s Study, 20% of rapists were described as friends, 16% as husbands, 14% as boyfriends, and 9% non-relatives such as handymen, coworkers and neighbours.

A 1992 study of reported rapes in inner-city and suburban Johannesburg, South Africa found 80% of rapes of adult women were perpetrated by strangers, often by men who abducted them at gunpoint on their way to work or broke into their houses. However, the majority of rapes of girls under 16 years of age were perpetrated by people known to them, usually family or friends, and sometimes gang members.

In India, anti-rape campaigns tend to focus on &quot;custodial rape&quot;: that is, rape of a woman by a man in a custodial position with higher status than hers, such as a landlord, policeman, or employer.

A 2005 study by the World Health Institute found that in Ethiopia almost all sexual violence is perpetrated by the husband or boyfriend of the victim.

== Types ==
Acquaintance rape is a broad category that includes all rapes except those perpetrated by people previously unknown to the rape victim. Acquaintance rape by definition includes all date rape and marital and other intra-family rape, as well as rape perpetrated by people such as classmates, co-workers, friends, neighbours, and people in business, employment or caretaker relationships. Prison rape, gang rape, child rape and statutory rape are often also forms of acquaintance rape. War rape and corrective rape fall under the category of acquaintance rape if the parties have met before the rape took place.

Rape of domestic and migrant workers by their employers has been reported in many countries including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.

=== College samples ===

Although date rape is a sub-section of acquaintance rape, many studies conducted with college student samples include both acquaintances and dating partners in the same category. All of the following studies on rape victimization among college women cited in this sub-section include non-dating acquaintances (for example, family members, friends, or classmates) as well as dating partners (such as boyfriends) in their questions on the characteristics of the rape perpetrator. Some studies have estimated that 90% of rapes perpetrated against college-age women are acquaintance rapes (Crawford et al. 2008; Fisher et al. 2000). A 2007 study by the National Crime Victims Research &amp; Treatment Center that surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 5,000 women, including 3,000 college women, found that, among the college women, over 50% of forcible rapes and about 70% of drug-facilitated or incapacitated rapes were perpetrated by an acquaintance (Kilpatrick et al. 2007).

=== Community samples ===
The National Crime Victims Research &amp; Treatment Center compared rape rates of college students and community women. (Kilpatrick et al. 2007) The study found that, compared to college students, women in the general population had higher rates of lifetime rape (18% vs 12%) and lifetime forcible rape (15% vs 6%). The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found that 41% of women with lifetime prevalence of rape had been assaulted by an acquaintance, and more than half (51%) were raped by a current or previous intimate partner (Black et al. 2011). Among rapes that were facilitated by alcohol or other drugs so that the victim was unable to fellate, virtually all cases (93%) were perpetrated by an acquaintance or an intimate partner. This survey also included male respondents. Although the overall lifetime prevalence of rape was lower for men than women (1 in 71, or 1.4%, men vs 1 in 5, or 18%, women), similarly half of rapes of men involved acquaintances (52%) and 15.1% by a stranger. Typically, perpetrators of male rape were other men.

== Motivations ==
Acquaintance rape is a broad category, and so the motivations of acquaintance rapists are varied. However, researchers say that acquaintance rapists generally share common characteristics: the ability to enjoy sex even with someone who is intoxicated, crying, pleading, resisting, vomiting and/or unconscious, and an exaggerated sense of entitlement and lack of guilt, remorse, empathy and compassion for others. Researchers say acquaintance rapists&#x27; primary motivation is sexual gratification, and that they tend to see their actions as seduction, not rape.

A study of 15 upper-middle-class American non-stranger rapists found many described their fathers as both physically and emotionally distant, and expressed hostility towards women and a desire to dominate them, and held hyper-masculine attitudes. One researcher theorized that men who have healthy relationships with their fathers may have less need to define themselves in opposition to women and be less inclined to &quot;hypermasculine displays of male superiority.&quot;

Researchers say gang rape is motivated by a desire to show off, to be part of a group, or fear of being ostracized by other men or boys if they don&#x27;t participate. Researchers say marital rape is not about sex and is instead about control, power, violence and humiliation.

== Effects ==
The large majority of rape victims do not sustain physical injury apart from the penetration itself. Contrary to what is often assumed, stranger rape is less likely to cause physical injury than acquaintance rape, particularly rape by a current or former intimate partner: 24% of women raped by a stranger sustain physical injury additional to the penetration, compared with 40–50% of women raped by a current or former partner.

== Reporting ==
The circumstances of the rape and relationship between the victim and the perpetrator do not change the legal definition of rape. Although acquaintance rape is well-represented among rapes that are reported to authorities, surveys show that they are much more likely than stranger rapes to go unreported. One American study found that less than 2% of victims of acquaintance rape had reported their rape to the police, compared with 21% of those raped by a stranger.

Cases involving acquaintances that are not reflected in crime statistics have been labeled hidden rape (Koss et al. 1988). For example, one national survey of college women showed that 29% of stranger rapes versus 3% of acquaintance rapes were reported to the police. The findings are similar among community women where 34% of stranger rapes and 13% of acquaintance rapes are reported (Kilpatrick et al. 2007). Among the reasons that acquaintance rapes may not be reported are that victims do not self-identify as rape victims. Not realizing or not choosing to view as rape an experience that involved force or alcohol/drug-facilitated penetration when unable to consent has been called unacknowledged rape. It is a well-accepted finding first reported in the late 1980s (Koss et al., 1988) repeated in the early 2000s (Fisher et al., 2003) and most recently replicated by Kilpatrick et al. 2007. Unacknowledged rape is more common in college students raped by acquaintances (23%) compared to strangers (55%). Among community women, those who acknowledge the incident as rape are more likely to report than those who do not (21% vs 6%). Women who had been drinking alcohol or using drugs at the time of the rape are less likely to report the experience to authorities (Kilpatrick et al. 2007; Fisher et al. 2003). Other reasons that rape victims who have been raped by a known perpetrator may be less likely to report are feelings of shame, self-blame for the rape, fear of not being believed, not wanting to stir up controversy in social or familial circles, and not wanting to get their acquaintance in trouble (Kilpatrick et al. 2007). These feelings are all encouraged by traditional rape myths that perpetuate the stereotype that acquaintance rapes are not “real” rapes (Estrich, 1987).

<text>Some victims of rape or other sexual violence incidents are male. Historically, rape was thought to be, and defined as, a crime committed solely against females. This belief is still held in some parts of the world, but rape of males is now commonly criminalized and has been subject to more discussion than in the past.

Males are far less likely to report sexual abuse than females. Rape of males is still taboo, and has a negative connotation among heterosexual and homosexual men. Community and service providers often react differently to male victims based on their sexual orientation and the gender of their perpetrators. It may be difficult for male victims to report a sexual assault they experienced, especially in a society with a strong masculine custom. They might be afraid that people will doubt their sexual orientation and label them homosexual, especially if raped by a male, or that they may be seen as un-masculine because they were a victim, and therefore many statistics underestimate how many males are raped due to their unwillingness to report sexual assault and rape. Most of the time, male victims try to hide and deny their victimization, similar to female victims, unless they have serious physical injuries. Eventually, the male victims may be very vague in explaining their injuries when they are seeking medical or mental health services.

==Research and statistics==
===General===

Research about male-victim rape had only just begun to appear by 1980, focusing mostly on male children. The studies of sexual assault in correctional facilities focusing specifically on the consequences of this kind of rape were available in the early 1980s, but nothing was available during the previous years. Most of the literature regarding rape and sexual assault focuses on female victims.

Only recently have some other forms of sexual violence against men been considered. In the 2010–2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey in Atlanta, Georgia (and a prior edition of this study completed in 2010), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) measured a category of sexual violence called &quot;being made to penetrate&quot; which captures instances in which victims were forced to or attempt to sexually penetrate someone (of either sex), either by physical force or coercion, or when the victim was intoxicated or otherwise unable to consent. The CDC found in the 2012 data that 1.715 million (up from 1.267 million in 2010) reported being &quot;made to penetrate&quot; another person in the preceding 12 months, similar to the 1.473 million (2010: 1.270 million) women who reported being raped in the same time period. The definitions of rape and &quot;made to penetrate&quot; in the CDC study were worded with extremely similar language.

===Male-on-male rape===
Male-on-male rape has been heavily stigmatized. According to psychologist Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-on-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported a lack of services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. In the United Kingdom, epidemiological studies have suggested that the rate of male rape is higher in gay and college communities.

Several studies argue that male-on-male prisoner rape, as well as female-on-female prisoner rape, are common types of rape which go unreported even more frequently than rape in the general population. The rape of men by men has been documented as a weapon of terror in warfare (see also War rape). In the case of the Syrian Civil War (2011–present), the male detainees experienced sexual abuse such as being forced to sit on a broken glass bottle, getting their genitals tied to a heavy bag of water, or being forced to watch the rape of another detainee by the officials.

===Female-on-male rape===
Female-on-male rape is under-researched compared to other forms of sexual violence. Statistics on the prevalence of female-on-male sexual violence, and its psychological effects are inconsistent across studies. One study (Hannon et al.) found 23.4% of women and 10.5% of men reported they were raped, while 6.6% of women and 10.5% of men reported they were victims of attempted rape. A 2010–2012 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that one in 17 men (5.9%) reported being made to penetrate at some point in their lives (up from 4.8% in 2010). The surveys also found that male victims often reported only female perpetrators in instances of being made to penetrate (2012: 78.5%, 2010: 79.2%), sexual coercion (2012: 81.6%, 2010: 83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (2012: 53.0%, 2010: 53.1%). Among male victims who were raped by being penetrated, 86.5% reported only male perpetrators, (down from 93.3% in the previous study published in 2010). A 2008 study of 98 men interviewed on the United States National Crime Victimization Survey found that nearly half of the men (46%) who reported some form of sexual victimization were victimized by women.

Regarding female-on-male sexual misconduct, the US Dept. of Justice reports in its opening statement (page 5): &quot;An estimated 4.4% of prison inmates and 3.1% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.&quot; Regarding female-on-male sexual misconduct (page 25) it states: &quot;Among the 39,121 male prison inmates who had been victims of staff sexual misconduct, 69% reported sexual activity with female staff; an additional 16% reported sexual activity with both female and male staff (table 18).&quot; and &quot;Nearly two-thirds of the male jail inmates who had been victimized said the staff perpetrator was female (64%).&quot;

Male victims of sexual abuse by females often face social, political, and legal double standards. The case of Cierra Ross&#x27; sexual assault of a man in Chicago gained national headlines, and Ross was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and armed robbery with a bail set at $75,000. A similar case includes James Landrith, who was made to penetrate a female acquaintance in a hotel room while incapacitated from drinking, while his rapist cited the fact that she was pregnant to advise him not to struggle, as it might hurt the baby.

Several widely publicized cases of female-on-male statutory rape in the United States involved school teachers having illegal sex with their underage students (see Mary Kay Letourneau and Debra Lafave). There have also been cases where an underage male victim of statutory rape was ordered by a judge to pay child support after the woman became pregnant (see &quot;Hermesmann v. Seyer&quot;).

==Myths regarding male victims of rape==

===Males are not vulnerable===
By masculine gender socialization, it is thought that males, even younger males, cannot be victims of rape, nor even that they are vulnerable. In some societies, it is considered shameful and unmanly if a male child cries, because the male stereotype depicts males as being able to protect themselves, which may not always be the case. Young boys may be weaker and vulnerable to perpetrators, who are usually stronger. The perpetrators can use whatever they have to abuse the child, including money or other bribes. An adult male may also be helpless to fight back, or fearful of doing so.

===Males always want sex===
A common societal belief is that a male must be aroused if he gets an erection or has an orgasm, therefore that means that he is willing and enjoying any sexual activity. Roy J. Levin and Willy Van Berlo wrote in an article in the &quot;Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine&quot; that slight genital stimulation or stress can create erections &quot;even though no specific sexual stimulation is present&quot;. An erection does not mean that the men consent to sex. Males can get erections even in traumatic or painful sexual situations, and this does not indicate consent.

Much like female erectile response, male erectile response is involuntary, meaning that a man does not need to be aroused for his penis to become erect; mechanical stimulation is all that is necessary. Arousal and stimulation are distinct things. Stimulation is a physical response to a stimulus. Men can be physically stimulated without feeling aroused and thus causing an erection. Men can be scared and intimidated into an erection, especially if the person is older or an authority.

=== Traumatization ===
One notion is that males are less traumatized by the abuse experience than females are; this includes the belief that males are less negatively affected. Studies show that the long-term effects are damaging for either sex and males may especially be more damaged by social stigma and disbelief of their victimization. It is noted by Eogan and Richardson that male victims tend to feel more intense anger than female victims, while both go through similar feelings of distress after the rape. Frazier (1993) studied 74 male and 1,380 female rape victims. She found that the depression and hostility are more profound on male victims immediately post-rape than on female victims.

Trauma recovery counselor Stephanie Baird says men who experience sexual attention as children often explain it to themselves as &quot;I&#x27;m a stud, I got laid by ...&quot;. Baird explains that they do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say. Carpenter (2009, citing Mezey, 1987) finds that the &quot;male coping strategy characterized by denial and control renders them more prone to later psychiatric problems and reduces the likelihood of seeking help&quot;.

===Sexual orientation===

Henry Leak, the chairman of the Survivors organization, stated that rape of males, as with females, has more to do with power than sexuality, and does not only happen inside the homosexual community. Sexual orientation is a complex issue, and the majority of male perpetrators who seek out boys are not homosexual.

Male sexual assault victims often fear being seen as weak or gay, or believe that their assault may be due to their appearance being effeminate so as to attract other males. They may also begin to question their own sexuality. Experts do not believe that premature sexual experiences play a significant role in later sexual orientation. Research by Jane Gilgun, Judith Becker and John Hunter states that while many perpetrators may have experienced sexual abuse of their own, most sexual assault victims will not go on to become adolescent perpetrators. However, gay and bisexual men can be victims of rape with &quot;13.2% of bisexual men and 11.6% of gay men reporting a history of rape in adulthood&quot;.

==During armed conflict==

Rape of males during wartime has been reported as prevalent in some parts of the world, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which suffered a civil war in 1997.

Across Africa, men who are raped often face social stigmatization and being ridiculed for being &quot;weak&quot; and failing to prevent the rape. They may also be accused of homosexuality (which is illegal in many countries of the region). For example, when some male refugees from the Congo sought treatment in Uganda, they were prosecuted for homosexuality, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported in 2012.

In northern Uganda, in recent years there have been ongoing attacks by rebel groups against the government forces. During these conflicts, civilian men have often been attacked, kidnapped, raped and forced to fight for the rebel groups. Victims of rape often face serious physical, emotional, and psychological trauma as a result of their experience.

==Effects==

===Physical effects===
Sexual abuse results in severe emotional and often physical trauma. Among sexual assault victims over 18, 31.5% of females and 16.1% of males said that they incurred non-genital injuries from the assault.

Male victims received more ancillary injuries and were more likely to be threatened with a weapon by the perpetrator. The symptoms and injuries most frequently noted are tension headaches, ulcers, nausea, colitis, abrasions to the throat, black eyes and broken bones. The study by Stermac and colleagues (2004) noted that 45% of male victims who went to a hospital sexual assault centre had some type of physical injury (25% soft tissue injury, 20% lacerations).

The data from hospital emergency rooms show that male rape victims are more likely to have non-genital injuries than females, and that they are more likely to neglect seeking medical attention if the injuries are not significant. Hodge and Canter (1998) report that homosexual male victims are more likely to sustain serious injuries than heterosexual male victims. Sometimes victims become infected by a sexually transmitted disease as the result of rape, but it is infrequent and includes only a small portion of male victims.

===Psychological effects===
Rape victims, males and females, may find it difficult to report the sexual assault against them. There is a myth that a male sexual assault victim will become a perpetrator themselves. This myth is very damaging to victims, both to their mental states and to how people treat them. Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, stated that males have the added burden of facing a society that does not believe that rape can happen to them at all. The social stigmatization of male victims is also damaging and has been described as &#x27;secondary victimization&#x27;. It has been linked to the under-reporting of rape and post-rape trauma; male victims are also susceptible to post-traumatic stress disorder. Some studies have found that some victims chose not to report their assaults as they fear being labelled as a &#x27;closet homosexual&#x27;, bisexual, or as promiscuous.

Regarding the blaming of victims of rape, researchers, in 1993, conducted an experiment and found that a statistically significant proportion of males tend to blame the victim, even when the rape victim was a male.

====Long-term effects====
Compared to men who have not been sexually assaulted, men who were sexually assaulted before age 18 have a greater risk of having mental health problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression; alcoholism and drug abuse; suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts; problems in intimate relationships; and underachievement at school and at work.

Because of gender expectations, being a male child victim of sexual abuse can lead to:
#Pressure to prove his manhood physically and sexually (becoming stronger and engaging in dangerous or violent behavior; having multiple female sexual partners).
#Confusion over gender and sexual identity.
#Sense of being an inadequate man.
#Sense of lost power, control, and confidence to his manhood.
#Problems with closeness and intimacy.
#Sexual problems.
#Fear of becoming &#x27;homosexual&#x27; or &#x27;gay&#x27;.
#Homophobia.

====Suicide possibility====

The suicide rate for sexually abused males is 14 to 15 times higher than for other males. McDonald and Tijerino found in their research that some participants state that there were occasions on which they felt so bad that they engaged in self-harming behaviors, including suicide attempts, and/or had suicidal thoughts. There is also a study that shows that rape victims are 4.1 times more likely to contemplate suicide and 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than non-crime victims.

Males have a much higher rate of suicide than females. One common explanation relies on the social constructions of hegemonic masculinity and femininity. In a review of the literature on gender and suicide, male suicide rates were explained in terms of traditional gender roles. Male gender roles tend to emphasize greater levels of strength, independence, and risk-taking behavior. Reinforcement of this gender role often prevents males from seeking help for suicidal feelings and depression.

===Healing therapy===
Sexual assault victims need extensive emotional and psychological healing after the rape, but male survivors are not likely to speak out their cases. Elizabeth Donovan, a psychotherapist, said; &quot;Males have the added burden of facing a society that doesn&#x27;t believe rape can happen to them ... at all.&quot;

==Prevalence==

===United States===
In 1995, the American Medical Association described male rape as a &#x27;silent-violent epidemic&#x27;. The CDC reports in 2010 stated that nearly 1 in 5 women, 1 in 71 men in the U.S. have been raped or have had an experience of attempted rape, while 4.8% of men (1 in 21) reported they were made to penetrate someone else at some time in their lives. Furthermore, the CDC found that 1.270 million women and 1.267 million men were raped or forced to penetrate someone else in the 12 months leading up to the report. Incidents of sexual violence in US are severely underreported, especially among male victims, that lead to an assumption that the actual number is likely higher.

Stephanie Baird, a trauma recovery counselor, cited the &quot;hot-for-teacher or babysitter complex&quot; that is a popular motif in modern American culture. The culture makes it more difficult for a male adolescent to even recognize that he is being abused. She explained that &quot;consent&quot; means &quot;being of age, mind, sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person&quot;, while children cannot consent.

Various studies estimate that at least 1 in 6 men have experienced sexual assault or abuse in their lifetime in the United States.

===United Kingdom===
In 2014, UK government statistics estimated that each year about 78,000 people in the UK become rape or attempted rape victims, and about 9,000 of these are men. Research suggests that the notoriously low report rate is particularly true among male victims. About 1,250 incidents of male-victim rape were reported to the police in 2011–2012. In February 2014, the ministry of justice set aside £500,000 to provide counseling and support for sexually abused males.

===China===
No official statistics are collected . However, the United Nations&#x27; 2013 &quot;Multi-Country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific&quot; found that 3% of Chinese men surveyed acknowledged having been raped by another man during their lifetime (suggesting that the proportion of male rapes as a percentage of all rapes was 14.4%).

===Taiwan===
Taiwan counted 12,066 victims of reported sexual assault in 2012 of which 1,335 victims were men. The Ministry of Interior showed that 7,608 minors were rape or sexual assault victims, with 1,063 of them being boys. To prevent the increasing number of these crimes, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education had released a short film on sexual education. The netizens (Internet users) and students of Taiwan are treating it as a subject of jokes. However, National Academy of Educational Research Secretary-General Kuo Kung-pin stated that the video has achieved its purpose to get attention from the youth to remind them that men can be raped as well.

===India===
The rape of males in India is commonly underreported. For this reason, some activists and research organizations, including Jai Vipra at the New Delhi think-tank Centre for Civil Society, argue that the phrasing of rape laws should be gender-neutral. This view is opposed by some human rights advocates and women&#x27;s rights activists. Mumbai-based human rights lawyer Flavia Agnes told the &quot;India Times&quot;, &quot;I oppose proposal to make rape laws gender-neutral. We had opposed it when the government made child rape laws gender-neutral ... If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court.&quot; International human rights lawyer and activist Vrinda Grover was quoted in the same article: &quot;There are no instances of women raping men. I don&#x27;t think men are facing serious sexual violence as women. Consider the brutality and intensity of sexual violence against women.&quot;

===Indonesia===
The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (, KPAI) reports that around 400 Indonesian children become victims of sexual assault per year, both by their families and other adults. According to KPAI Secretary General Erlinda, &quot;the majority of children who are victims of sexual violence are males, because boys are vulnerable to becoming victims of sexual offenders as they are easily persuaded by perpetrators who are pedophiles.&quot;

Emayartini (2013) became the first Indonesian woman to be sentenced to prison for raping six teenage boys. She almost escaped the law after she was deemed to have a mental disorder. Unlike male rapists, she was subject to the Child Protection Law No. 23 of 2002, rather than the laws against rape.

==National laws==
===China===
Before 2015, article 236 of the revised Criminal Law of China specifies that the crime of rape may be committed only against women. It protects women&#x27;s right to sexual autonomy but not men&#x27;s. In 2011, the first-ever conviction for sexual assault on a man occurred with a Beijing security guard as the perpetrator, but he was convicted of intentional injury rather than rape, sentenced to one year in prison and to pay 20,000 yuan ($3,026) as compensation. A convicted rapist will get at least three years in prison.

The guidelines of China on child protection strengthen the punishments for sexual offenses against underage girls, but don&#x27;t offer equal protection to underage boys. Molestation of both sexes is treated equally at present, but the rapists of boys can only be charged with child molestation with 5 years in prison as a maximum sentence. In September 2013, 27 NGOs called for the law to give equal protection to boys below 18 years old in cases of sexual offences.

Until November 1, 2015, sexual offences against males above the age of 14 could not be prosecuted unless they also included a physical assault, in which case only the physical component was punishable. However, a revision of Article 237, which criminalises &quot;forcible indecency,&quot; made that section of the law gender-neutral. Offences that constitute rape of males may be tried under this article, with offenders facing a maximum of five years in prison.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code, Section 377, is the only section that criminalizes all acts of nonconsensual carnal intercourse, including male-on-male rape.

This section penalizes both consensual and forced sodomy with 10 years minimum to life imprisonment. The Delhi HC stated that Section 377 of Indian Penal Code will continue to govern non-consensual penile, non-vaginal sex and penile non-vaginal sex involving minors. The section can be evoked to punish sodomites, pedophiles and zoophiles.

The rape definition in Section 375 of Indian Penal Code does not include rape in which males are the victims. The Indian government (2012) decided to change the definition of &quot;rape&quot; as forcible penetration to include male victims, but was criticized on the grounds that this would further harm the interests of female rape victims.

In the 2013 Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, rape and sexual harassment crimes were gender neutral. The term &quot;rape&quot; was removed and substituted with &quot;sexual assault&quot;. But strong objections were raised by feminist groups that made the Indian government decided to restore the term &quot;rape&quot; and state that only men can be the rapists of women.

===Indonesia===
Based on &quot;Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana&quot; (Indonesian&#x27;s Penal Code), males cannot be the victims of rape. In paragraph 285, rape is defined as a sexual violence against a female having a sentence of imprisonment for a maximum of 12 years, while in paragraph 289, the victim of &quot;vulgar actions&quot; is not defined as male or female and the punishment is a maximum of 9 years imprisonment. The commentary on paragraph 285 by R. Soesilo stated that the law makers didn&#x27;t need to determine the punishment for a female perpetrator that forced males to have intercourse with her. This is not because such action is not possible, but the act is deemed to not do harm or result in something bad to male victims, such as pregnancy in females.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the word &quot;rape&quot; can only be used in the instance where females are penetrated by a male. Females can be punished to the same degree as male-on-female rape, however.

===Philippines===
Prior to the 1997 amendment of Revised Penal Code of 1930, male victims of rape were not acknowledged under Philippine law. Article 266-A of the law defines rape by &quot;an act of sexual assault&quot; by any person either by &quot;inserting his penis into another person&#x27;s mouth or anal orifice&quot; or inserting &quot;any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person&quot;. The 1997 amendment allowed the legal recognition of rape of males, both by other males and by females.

However there are different penalties for the offense of raping of boys compared to doing the same act to girls. Rape against boys is considered by law as rape by sexual assault, which carries a lesser penalty of six to 12 years of imprisonment while rape against girls are penalized by life imprisonment.

===Singapore===

Male victims of rape are not acknowledged in Singapore law. A male rape victim is not considered a rape victim under S375(1) of Penal Code, which defines rape as the act of a man penetrating a woman&#x27;s vagina with his penis without her consent. Penetration of other body orifices is not rape but an unlawful sexual penetration (S376(1), Penal Code). Both crimes carry the same penalty: imprisonment for a term of up to 20 years plus fine or caning. (S375(2) and S376(4), Penal Code).

===United Kingdom===
Previously, English law did not include rape of males as a criminal offense and it was recorded as non-consensual buggery. A convicted rapist (of a female) could be imprisoned for life, stated Henry Leak, the chairman of Survivors organization, while buggery only carried 10 years maximum as a sentence. This is however no longer the case; the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 s. 142 was the first to lead this development and recognize male-victim rape; and the Sexual Offences Act 2003 states that penetration of the &quot;mouth, anus or vagina with [the defendant&#x27;s] penis&quot; is sufficient for rape at s. 1(1)(a). &quot;R v Ismail&quot; [2005] All ER 216 further prevented distinction between &quot;mouth, anus or vagina&quot; when sentencing.

Under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 men can be both perpetrators and victims. However, in all parts of the United Kingdom a female cannot be legally charged with &#x27;rape&#x27; (she must be instead charged with other offenses such as sexual assault, assault by penetration, or causing sexual activity without consent, of which the latter two carry the same maximum sentence).

===United States===
The FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Report in 2012 redefined rape as: &quot;The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.&quot; The prior definition had not changed since 1927 and gained the attention of sexual assault awareness groups because it had alienated the victims who did not fit the definition – &quot;the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will&quot;. The former definition of &quot;forcible rape&quot; focused on vaginal penetration, but the newer definition includes forcible anal or oral penetration. The old definition, &quot;the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will&quot;, did not include forcible oral or anal penetration, the rape of women with other objects, or the rape of a man.

This new definition encourages male rape victims to seek the help they need and also includes sexual assaults that previously were not covered by the definition of rape. The basis for changing this definition lies in the statistics provided by governmental institutions such as the U.S. Department of Justice and the CDC. A study done by the CDC found that 1 in 71 men had been raped or had been the target of attempted rape. This study included oral and anal penetration in its definition but did not include men in prison or men made to penetrate. Gender-neutral laws have combated the perception that rape rarely occurs to men, and other laws have eliminated the term &quot;rape&quot; altogether.
