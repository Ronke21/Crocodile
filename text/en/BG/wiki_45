<text>Apollonius of Rhodes ( &quot;Apollṓnios Rhódios&quot;; ; fl. first half of 3rd century BC) was an ancient Greek author, best known for the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, an epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their quest for the Golden Fleece. The poem is one of the few extant examples of the epic genre and it was both innovative and influential, providing Ptolemaic Egypt with a &quot;cultural mnemonic&quot; or national &quot;archive of images&quot;, and offering the Latin poets Virgil and Gaius Valerius Flaccus a model for their own epics. His other poems, which survive only in small fragments, concerned the beginnings or foundations of cities, such as Alexandria and Cnidus places of interest to the Ptolemies, whom he served as a scholar and librarian at the Library of Alexandria. A literary dispute with Callimachus, another Alexandrian librarian/poet, is a topic much discussed by modern scholars since it is thought to give some insight into their poetry, although there is very little evidence that there ever was such a dispute between the two men. In fact, almost nothing at all is known about Apollonius and even his connection with Rhodes is a matter for speculation. Once considered a mere imitator of Homer, and therefore a failure as a poet, his reputation has been enhanced by recent studies, with an emphasis on the special characteristics of Hellenistic poets as scholarly heirs of a long literary tradition writing at a unique time in history.

==Life==
===Sources===
The most reliable information we have about ancient poets is largely drawn from their own works. Unfortunately, Apollonius of Rhodes reveals nothing about himself. Most of the biographical material comes from four sources: two are texts entitled &quot;Life of Apollonius&quot; found in the scholia on his work (&quot;Vitae&quot; A and B); a third is an entry in the 10th-century encyclopaedia the &quot;Suda&quot;; and fourthly a 2nd-century BCE papyrus, P.Oxy. 1241, which provides names of several heads of the Library of Alexandria. Other scraps can be gleaned from miscellaneous texts. The reports from all the above sources however are scanty and often self-contradictory.

=== Main events ===
* Birth. The two &quot;Lives&quot; and the &quot;Suda&quot; name Apollonius&#x27; father as Silleus or Illeus, but both names are very rare (hapax legomenon) and may derive from or &quot;lampoon&quot;, suggesting a comic source (ancient biographers often accepted or misconstrued the testimony of comic poets). The second &quot;Life&quot; names his mother as &quot;Rhode&quot;, but this is unlikely; &quot;Rhodē&quot; means &quot;Rhodian woman&quot;, and is almost certainly derived from an attempt to explain Apollonius&#x27; epithet &quot;Rhodian&quot;. The &quot;Lives&quot;, the &quot;Suda&quot;, and the geographical writer Strabo say that he came from Alexandria; Athenaeus and Aelian say that he came from Naucratis, some 70 km south of Alexandria along the river Nile. No source gives the date of his birth.
* Association with Callimachus. The &quot;Lives&quot; and the &quot;Suda&quot; agree that Apollonius was a student of the poet and scholar Callimachus. &quot;Vita B&quot; states that Callimachus was his instructor in rhetoric (), but the terminology is anachronistic. Moreover, in ancient biographies &quot;pupil&quot; and &quot;student&quot; are figures of speech designating the influence one poet may have exercised over another. Their poetic works do in fact indicate a close relationship, if only as authors, with similarities in theme and composition, style and phrasing, but it is not easy to work out who was responding to whom, especially since &#x27;publication&#x27; was a gradual process in those days, with shared readings of drafts and circulation of private copies: &quot;In these circumstances interrelationships between writers who habitually cross-refer and allude to one another are likely to be complex.&quot;

*Head of the Library of Alexandria. The second &quot;Life&quot;, the &quot;Suda&quot;, and P.Oxy. 1241 attest that Apollonius held this post. Moreover, P.Oxy. 1241 indicates that Apollonius was succeeded in the position by Eratosthenes; this must have been after 247/246 BC, the date of the accession of Ptolemy III Euergetes, who was probably tutored by Apollonius and who appointed Eratosthenes. The chronology of P.Oxy. 1241 bears some signs of confusion since it lists Apollonius under Ptolemy I Soter (died 283 BCE), or Ptolemy V Epiphanes (born 210 BCE). The &quot;Suda&quot; says that Apollonius succeeded Eratosthenes, but this does not fit the evidence either. There was another Alexandrian librarian named Apollonius (&quot;The Eidographer&quot;, succeeding Aristophanes of Byzantium as library head) and this may have caused some of the confusion.
*Association with Rhodes. The epithet &quot;Rhodios&quot; or &quot;Rhodian&quot; indicates that Apollonius had some kind of association with the island of that name. The &quot;Lives&quot; and the &quot;Suda&quot; attest to his move there from Alexandria. They differ about whether he died in Rhodes or came back to Alexandria to take up the position of head of the Library. According to &quot;Vita A&quot;, he was a famous teacher in Rhodes, but it may have confused him with yet another Apollonius (Apollonius the Effeminate) who taught rhetoric there. In fact the epithet &quot;of Rhodes&quot; need not indicate any physical association with the island. It might simply reflect the fact that he once wrote a poem about Rhodes. According to Athenaeus, he was also called the &quot;Naucratite&quot;. Some modern scholars doubt that he was ever given that title but, if he was, it may be because he composed a poem about the foundation of Naucratis.
*Death. Only the two &quot;Lives&quot; give information about Apollonius&#x27; death, and they disagree. The first reports that he died in Rhodes; the second reports that he died after returning to Alexandria and adds that &quot;some say&quot; he was buried with Callimachus.

=== Sensational stories ===
Ancient biographies often represent famous poets as going into exile to escape their ungrateful fellow citizens. Thus for example Homer was said to have left Cyme because the government there would not support him at public expense (&quot;Vit. Herod.&quot; 13-14), Aeschylus left Athens for Sicily because Athenians valued him less than some other poets (&quot;Vit. Aesch.&quot;), while Euripides fled to Macedonia because of humiliation by comic poets (&quot;Vit. Eur.&quot;). Similarly &quot;Vitae&quot; A and B tell us that Apollonius moved to Rhodes because his work was not well received in Alexandria. According to B, he redrafted the &quot;Argonautica&quot; in such fine style at Rhodes that he was able to return to Alexandria in triumph, where he was rewarded with a post in the library and finally a place in the cemetery next to Callimachus. These stories were probably invented to account for the existence of a second edition of &quot;Argonautica&quot;, indicated by variant readings in ancient manuscripts.

Until recently modern scholarship has made much of a feud between Callimachus and Apollonius. The evidence partly rests on an elegiac epigram in the Palatine Anthology, attributed to &quot;Apollonius the grammarian&quot;. It blames Callimachus for some unstated offense and mocks both him and his most famous poem, the &quot;Aetia&quot; (&quot;Causes&quot;):
Ancient sources describe Callimachus&#x27;s poem &quot;Ibis&quot; — which does not survive — as a polemic and some of them identified Apollonius as the target. These references conjure up images of a sensational literary feud between the two figures. Such a feud is consistent with what we know of Callimachus&#x27;s taste for scholarly controversy and it might even explain why Apollonius departed for Rhodes. Thus there arises &quot;a romantic vision of scholarly warfare in which Apollonius was finally driven out of Alexandria by a triumphant Callimachus&quot;. However, both of the &quot;Lives&quot; of Apollonius stress the friendship between the poets, the second &quot;Life&quot; even saying they were buried together; moreover Callimachus&#x27;s poem &quot;Ibis&quot; is known to have been deliberately obscure and some modern scholars believe the target was never meant to be identified. There is still not a consensus about the feud, but most scholars of Hellenistic literature now believe it has been enormously sensationalised, if it happened at all.

=== Scholar ===
Apollonius was among the foremost Homeric scholars in the Alexandrian period. He wrote the period&#x27;s first scholarly monograph on Homer, critical of the editions of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; published by Zenodotus, his predecessor as head of the Library of Alexandria. &quot;Argonautica&quot; seems to have been written partly as an experimental means of communicating his own researches into Homer&#x27;s poetry and to address philosophical themes in poetry. It has even been called &quot;a kind of poetic dictionary of Homer&quot;, without at all detracting from its merits as poetry. He has been credited with scholarly prose works on Archilochus and on problems in Hesiod. He is also considered to be one of the period&#x27;s most important authors on geography, though approaching the subject differently from Eratosthenes, his successor at the library and a radical critic of Homer&#x27;s geography. It was a time when the accumulation of scientific knowledge was enabling advances in geographical studies, as represented by the activities of Timosthenes, a Ptolemaic admiral and a prolific author. Apollonius set out to integrate new understandings of the physical world with the mythical geography of tradition and his &quot;Argonautica&quot; was, in that sense, a didactic epic on geography, again without detracting from its merits as poetry.

== His poetry ==
=== Poems ===
==== &quot;Argonautica&quot; ====
The &quot;Argonautica&quot; differs in some respects from traditional or Homeric Greek epic, though Apollonius certainly used Homer as a model. The &quot;Argonautica&quot; is shorter than Homer&#x27;s epics, with four books totalling fewer than 6000 lines, while the &quot;Iliad&quot; runs to more than 16,000. Apollonius may have been influenced here by Callimachus&#x27;s brevity, or by Aristotle’s demand for &quot;poems on a smaller scale than the old epics, and answering in length to the group of tragedies presented at a single sitting&quot; (the &quot;Poetics&quot;).

Apollonius&#x27; epic also differs from the more traditional epic in its weaker, more human protagonist Jason and in its many digressions into local custom, aetiology, and other popular subjects of Hellenistic poetry. Apollonius also chooses the less shocking versions of some myths, having Medea, for example, merely watch the murder of Apsyrtus instead of murdering him herself. The gods are relatively distant and inactive throughout much of the epic, following the Hellenistic trend to allegorise and rationalise religion. Heterosexual loves such as Jason&#x27;s are more emphasized than homosexual loves such as that of Heracles and Hylas, another trend in Hellenistic literature. Many critics regard the love of Medea and Jason in the third book as the best written and most memorable episode.

Opinions on the poem have changed over time. Some critics in antiquity considered it mediocre. Recent criticism has seen a renaissance of interest in the poem and an awareness of its qualities: numerous scholarly studies are published regularly, its influence on later poets like Virgil is now well recognised, and any account of the history of epic poetry now routinely includes substantial attention to Apollonius.

==== Foundation-poems ====
A handful of fragments are all that survive of his other work, mostly &quot;ktiseis&quot; () or &#x27;foundation-poems&#x27;, apparently dealing with the mythical origins of cities, a theme that Apollonius also touches on in &quot;Argonautica&quot; (as for example in the foundation of Cius, 1.1321-23). The fragments have been given considerable attention recently, with speculation about their authenticity, about the subject matter and treatment of the original poems, their geo-political significance for Ptolemaic Egypt, and how they relate to &quot;Argonautika&quot;.
* The Founding of Alexandria: all that survives is the title and a scholar&#x27;s marginal note, written in a manuscript of a different author (Nicander), attributing to this Apollonius poem the statement that all biting creatures originated from the blood of the Gorgon.
*The Founding of Caunus: two comments in Parthenius&#x27;s &quot;Love Stories&quot; are the only testament to this poem but they seem to give conflicting accounts. According to one, it deals with the story of Lyrcus; according to the other, it deals with the story of Byblis. This might indicate a loose, episodic structure, rather than a unified narrative. It might then be inferred that this kind of treatment was typical of his other foundation poems as well (the question of unity is one of the main issues even in &quot;Argonautica&quot;, which is sometimes termed an &quot;episodic epic&quot;). Five hexameter verses attributed to Apollonius may be a fragment of this poem but they seem unrelated to the stories of Lyrcus and Byblis and some scholars think they come from the next poem.
* The Founding of Cnidus: Stephanus of Byzantium wrote the following entry for (Cooling)&quot;a place in Thrace, taking its name from Heracles, who cooled off his sweat when he threw Adramyles in wrestling, as Apollonius says in his &quot;Founding of Cnidus&quot;.&quot; That&#x27;s all we know of the poem, unless the five hexameter lines belong here, and those describe sea routes also dealt with in &quot;Argonautica&quot;.
* The Founding of Naucratis: Athenaeus quotes six and a bit hexameters and provides a commentary, concerning Apollo&#x27;s abduction of Ocyrhoe and the punishment of a fisherman, Pompilus, who tried to protect her and was turned into a fish of the same name. According to the commentary, the Pompilus fish was a topic of great interest to poets and scholars, including Callimachus and Theocritus. It may be inferred that Apollonius developed a melodramatic story of passion from the etymology (&quot;pompilus&quot; denotes an &quot;escort fish&quot;). It is not known how this episode might have fitted into a poem on the origins of Naucratis. Possibly a broad-based account of its foundation owed something to Herodotus. 
*The Founding of Rhodes: all that we have is one and a bit hexameters, quoted by Stephanus of Byzantium to demonstrate a lexicographical point, and the testimony of a scholium to Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Victory Ode&quot; 7.48, citing Apollonius as the source for a myth explaining the Rhodian practice of sacrificing without firethey hated the fire-god Hephaestus because he once tried to rape Athena.
* The Founding of Lesbos: twenty-one hexameters were quoted by Parthenius under the title &quot;Lesbou ktisis&quot;. The author&#x27;s name was not given but modern scholars attribute the verses to Apollonius since it has some clear affinities with the Jason/Medea story. It deals with the Lesbian princess, Pisidice, who betrayed her countrymen and her parents by opening the city gates to the man she loved, Achilles. Her reward was not the marriage she had anticipated but rather death by stoning at the hands of the Argives. It can be argued that Peisidice&#x27;s viewpoint dominates the poem and that, as with &quot;Argonautica&quot;, epic material has been used unconventionally as a window into the female psyche.

====Others====
*Canobus: three choliambic verses were quoted by Stephanus Byzantius from a poem of this title, and a scholium to Nicander&#x27;s &quot;Theriaca&quot; refers to it in a discussion on snake bites. It isn&#x27;t known if the poem was about Canobus (sometimes called Canopus), the helmsman of Menelaus, buried in Egypt, or about the foundation of the city bearing his name. The choliambic meter distinguishes it from the above foundation poems, which are all in dactylic hexameters.
*Callimachus epigram: The epigram, quoted in the biography section, was preserved in the Palatine Anthology, where it was attributed to &#x27;Apollonius the Grammarian&#x27;. This might not have been Apollonius of Rhodes.

===Poetic style===
Apollonius&#x27;s poetic skills and technique have only recently come to be appreciated, with critical recognition of his successful fusing of poetry and scholarship.

<text>The Great Race (or &quot;Harry Mahon Trophy&quot;) was an annual rowing race between the men&#x27;s eight from the University of Waikato, New Zealand and a prominent university team (or teams) from outside New Zealand. The race was held over a 4.8 kilometre stretch of the Waikato River in Hamilton and was raced upstream. The women race for the &quot;Bryan Gould Cup&quot;.

==History==

Previously, the University of Waikato had raced the University of Auckland over the Waikato River course in an annual fixture, which was first held in 1989. Known then as the &#x27;Gallagher Boathouse Eights&#x27;, the event was organised by Waikato University Sport &amp; Recreation Manager Bill Crome and received huge local support from the people of Hamilton. Waikato won the first encounter against Auckland with a crew that contained three former Olympic representatives, Nigel Atherfold, Greg Johnston and Chris White, with the rest of the crew consisting of Waikato Rowing Club oarsmen, Andy Mahon, Nik Posa and Richard Kirke, and Stephen Hatfield and Chris Spanninga from the Hamilton Rowing Club, and coxswain Russell Robson.

The race in its current (international) format was the creation of British politician Bryan Gould, who was a former vice-chancellor of the University of Waikato and a graduate of the University of Oxford. The winners receive the right to hold the Harry Mahon memorial trophy. Harry Mahon, who was born in New Zealand, was a highly respected rowing coach for the Cambridge rowing team and the Olympic British rowing eight. He led many crews to World Championship and Olympic medals. Harry Mahon died of liver cancer in 2001.

The race has been organised by U Leisure from the University of Waikato and Olympic rower Rob Hamill since its conception.

The first race was held on 1 September 2002 where the University of Waikato crew led from the start and won by many boat lengths over the Cambridge University crew. For the second race, held on 7 September 2003, the Oxford crew got out to an early lead of two boat lengths by the first bridge. By half way, the Waikato crew had caught up and powered home to win the race by two boat lengths.

Since 2011, the tenth anniversary race, the format changed from the two boat competition of previous races, to a three boat competition. In 2011 the Waikato crew beat out University of Melbourne and Cambridge University, after Cambridge was forced to row without a rudder following a collision with Waikato; the race was restarted following the collision, caused by Cambridge failing to yield to the Waikato boat.

==Layout==

The boats used for the Great Race are custom built identical heavyweight men&#x27;s eights from KIRS (Kiwi International Rowing Skiffs) in Cambridge, New Zealand. The nature of the river creates a highly technical course, with the current frequently switching from side to side of the river over the length of the course. This creates an advantage to the team on the side that the current is not on. The current ranges in speed from 0.64 m/s to 1.30 m/s. The slower water has the potential of slowing down a rowing boat down by 1.5 km/h over the length of the race. The race passes under four bridges along its length.

The visiting crew is flown out to New Zealand and entertained for the period of their stay. In the past this has included accommodation and use of the world class rowing facilities at Lake Karapiro. A full itinerary is organised for the crew, which allows them to really get a taste of New Zealand and make their stay in New Zealand a truly memorable one. Past crews have commented that this has really helped strengthen team bonding as well as making the long journey to New Zealand extremely enjoyable. The race is treated very seriously by both crews and visiting coxswains and coaches are given full briefings on the complexities of the Waikato River and the race course. The event has a high profile in the Hamilton community and as such the visiting crews attract a lot of media attention.

Rowing on the river starts at 9 am with corporate crews battling for work place bragging rights. This is followed by the secondary school races, which has the top NZ school crews and girls) racing over a 3 km upstream course. The boys&#x27; race is traditionally between Hamilton Boys&#x27; High School and various other schools from around the Waikato and Auckland. The day culminates in the two international races – the Bryan Gould Cup (woman) and the Harry Mahon Trophy (men) – raced over the 4.2 km Great Race course.

The event draws crowds of 20,000 + to the river banks in Hamilton and is covered by national radio and television. Spectator entertainment takes on a carnival atmosphere with corporate hosting, street theatre, displays, competitions and markets, and popular NZ and local music acts performing. The day before the race the two teams compete on indoor rowing machines, initially for fun, but now used to determine starting positions for the race. The Waikato River is sacred to the local Tainui Maori tribe, and a ceremonial haka (war dance) is performed on the boat ramp and a waka (traditional Maori canoe) leads off the two crews to the start line.

<text>The temporal bones are situated at the sides and base of the skull, and lateral to the temporal lobes of the cerebral cortex.

The temporal bones are overlaid by the sides of the head known as the temples where four of the cranial bones fuse. Each temple is covered by a temporal muscle. The temporal bones house the structures of the ears. The lower seven cranial nerves and the major vessels to and from the brain traverse the temporal bone.

==Structure==

The temporal bone consists of four parts—the squamous, mastoid, petrous and tympanic parts. The squamous part is the largest and most superiorly positioned relative to the rest of the bone. The zygomatic process is a long, arched process projecting from the lower region of the squamous part and it articulates with the zygomatic bone. Posteroinferior to the squamous is the mastoid part. Fused with the squamous and mastoid parts and between the sphenoid and occipital bones lies the petrous part, which is shaped like a pyramid. The tympanic part is relatively small and lies inferior to the squamous part, anterior to the mastoid part, and superior to the styloid process. The styloid, from the Greek &quot;stylos&quot;, is a phallic shaped pillar directed inferiorly and anteromedially between the parotid gland and internal jugular vein. 

===Borders===

===Development===

The temporal bone is ossified from eight centers, exclusive of those for the internal ear and the tympanic ossicles: one for the squama including the zygomatic process, one for the tympanic part, four for the petrous and mastoid parts, and two for the styloid process. Just before the end of prenatal development [Fig. 6] the temporal bone consists of three principal parts:
# The squama is ossified in membrane from a single nucleus, which appears near the root of the zygomatic process about the second month.
# The petromastoid part is developed from four centers, which make their appearance in the cartilaginous ear capsule about the fifth or sixth month. One (proötic) appears in the neighborhood of the eminentia arcuata, spreads in front and above the internal auditory meatus and extends to the apex of the bone; it forms part of the cochlea, vestibule, superior semicircular canal, and medial wall of the tympanic cavity. A second (opisthotic) appears at the promontory on the medial wall of the tympanic cavity and surrounds the fenestra cochleæ; it forms the floor of the tympanic cavity and vestibule, surrounds the carotid canal, invests the lateral and lower part of the cochlea, and spreads medially below the internal auditory meatus. A third (pterotic) roofs in the tympanic cavity and antrum; while the fourth (epiotic) appears near the posterior semicircular canal and extends to form the mastoid process (Vrolik).
# The tympanic ring is an incomplete circle, in the concavity of which is a groove, the tympanic sulcus, for the attachment of the circumference of the eardrum (tympanic membrane). This ring expands to form the tympanic part, and is ossified in membrane from a single center which appears about the third month. The styloid process is developed from the proximal part of the cartilage of the second branchial or hyoid arch by two centers: one for the proximal part, the tympanohyal, appears before birth; the other, comprising the rest of the process, is named the stylohyal, and does not appear until after birth. The tympanic ring unites with the squama shortly before birth; the petromastoid part and squama join during the first year, and the tympanohyal portion of the styloid process about the same time [Fig. 7, 8]. The stylohyal does not unite with the rest of the bone until after puberty, and in some skulls never at all.

===Postnatal development===
Apart from size increase, the chief changes from birth through puberty in the temporal bone are as follows:
# The tympanic ring extends outward and backward to form the tympanic part. This extension does not, however, take place at an equal rate all around the circumference of the ring, but occurs more at its anterior and posterior portions. As these outgrowths meet, they create a foramen in the floor of the meatus, the foramen of Huschke. This foramen is usually closed about the fifth year, but may persist throughout life.
# The mandibular fossa is at first extremely shallow, and looks lateral and inferior; it deepens and directs more inferiorly over time. The part of the squama which forms the fossa lies at first below the level of the zygomatic process. As, the base of the skull thickens, this part of the squama is directed horizontal and inwards to contribute to the middle cranial fossa, and its surfaces look upward and downward; the attached portion of the zygomatic process everts and projects like a shelf at a right angle to the squama.
# The mastoid portion is at first flat, with the stylomastoid foramen and rudimentary styloid immediately behind the tympanic ring. With air cell development, the outer part of the mastoid component grows anteroinferiorly to form the mastoid process, with the styloid and stylomastoid foramen now on the under surface. The descent of the foramen is accompanied by a requisite lengthening of the facial canal.
# The downward and forward growth of the mastoid process also pushes forward the tympanic part; as a result, its portion that formed the original floor of the meatus, and contained the foramen of Huschke, rotates to become the anterior wall.
# The subarcuate fossa is nearly effaced.

==Clinical significance==
Glomus jugulare tumor:
* A glomus jugulare tumor is a tumor of the part of the temporal bone in the skull that involves the middle and inner ear structures. This tumor can affect the ear, upper neck, base of the skull, and the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.
* A glomus jugulare tumor grows in the temporal bone of the skull, in an area called the jugular foramen. The jugular foramen is also where the jugular vein and several important nerves exit the skull.
* This area contains nerve fibers, called glomus bodies. Normally, these nerves respond to changes in body temperature or blood pressure.
* These tumors most often occur later in life, around age 60 or 70, but they can appear at any age. The cause of a glomus jugulare tumor is unknown. In most cases, there are no known risk factors. Glomus tumors have been associated with changes (mutations) in a gene responsible for the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHD).

===Trauma===
Temporal bone fractures were historically divided into three main categories, &quot;longitudinal&quot;, in which the vertical axis of the fracture paralleled the petrous ridge, &quot;horizontal&quot;, in which the axis of the fracture was perpendicular to the petrous ridge, and &quot;oblique&quot;, a mixed type with both longitudinal and horizontal components. Horizontal fractures were thought to be associated with injuries to the facial nerve, and longitudinal with injuries to the middle ear ossicles.
More recently, delineation based on disruption of the otic capsule has been found as more reliable in predicting complications such as facial nerve injury, sensorineural hearing loss, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea.

==Other animals==
In many animals some of these parts stay separate through life:
* Squamosal: the squama including the zygomatic process
* Tympanic bone: the tympanic part: this is derived from the angular bone of the reptilian lower jaw
* Periotic bone: the petrous and mastoid parts
* Two parts of the hyoid arch: the styloid process. In the dog these small bones are called tympanohyal (upper) and stylohyal (lower).

In evolutionary terms, the temporal bone is derived from the fusion of many bones that are often separate in non-human mammals:
* The squamosal bone, which is homologous with the squama, and forms the side of the cranium in many bony fish and tetrapods. Primitively, it is a flattened plate-like bone, but in many animals it is narrower in form, for example, where it forms the boundary between the two temporal fenestrae of diapsid reptiles.
* The petrous and mastoid parts of the temporal bone, which derive from the periotic bone, formed from the fusion of a number of bones surrounding the ear of reptiles. The delicate structure of the middle ear, unique to mammals, is generally not protected in marsupials, but in placentals, it is usually enclosed within a bony sheath called the auditory bulla. In many mammals this is a separate tympanic bone derived from the angular bone of the reptilian lower jaw, and, in some cases, it has an additional entotympanic bone. The auditory bulla is homologous with the tympanic part of the temporal bone.
* Two parts of the hyoid arch: the styloid process. In the dog the styloid process is represented by a series of four articulating bones, from top down tympanohyal, stylohyal, epihyal, ceratohyal; the first two represent the styloid process, and the ceratohyal represents the anterior horns of the hyoid bone and articulates with the basihyal which represents the body of the hyoid bone.

==Etymology==
Its exact etymology is unknown. It is thought to be from the Old French meaning &quot;earthly&quot;, which is directly from the Latin meaning &quot;time, proper time or season.&quot; Temporal bones are situated on the sides of the skull, where grey hairs usually appear early on. Or it may relate to the pulsations of the underlying superficial temporal artery, marking the time we have left here. There is also a probable connection with the Greek verb &quot;temnion&quot;, to wound in battle. The skull is thin in this area and presents a vulnerable area for a blow from a battle axe. Another possible etymology is described at Temple (anatomy).

<doc id="314201" wikidata="Q1358798" url="?curid=314201" title="High Court of Australia">
<text>The High Court of Australia is the apex court of the Australian legal system. It exercises original and appellate jurisdiction on matters specified in the Constitution of Australia and supplementary legislation.

The High Court was established following the passage of the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot; (Cth). Its authority derives from chapter III of the Australian Constitution, which vests it (and other courts the Parliament creates) with the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Its internal processes are governed by the &quot;High Court of Australia Act 1979&quot; (Cth).

The court consists of seven justices, including a chief justice, currently Stephen Gageler. Justices of the High Court are appointed by the governor-general on the formal advice of the attorney-general following the approval of the prime minister and Cabinet. They are appointed permanently until their mandatory retirement at age 70, unless they retire earlier.

Typically, the court operates by receiving applications for appeal from parties in a process called special leave. If a party&#x27;s application is accepted, the court will proceed to a full hearing, usually with oral and written submissions from both parties. After conclusion of the hearing, the result is decided by the court. The special leave process does not apply in situations where the court elects to exercise its original jurisdiction; however, the court typically delegates its original jurisdiction to Australia&#x27;s inferior courts.

The court has resided in Canberra since 1980, following the construction of a purpose-built High Court building, located in the Parliamentary Triangle and overlooking Lake Burley Griffin. Sittings of the court previously rotated between state capitals, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, and the court continues to regularly sit outside Canberra.

== Role ==
The High Court exercises both original and appellate jurisdiction.

Sir Owen Dixon said on his swearing in as Chief Justice of Australia in 1952:

The High Court&#x27;s jurisdiction is divided in its exercise between constitutional and federal cases which loom so largely in the public eye, and the great body of litigation between man and man, or even man and government, which has nothing to do with the Constitution, and which is the principal preoccupation of the court
The broad jurisdiction of the High Court means that it has an important role in Australia&#x27;s legal system.

=== Original jurisdiction ===
Its original jurisdiction is determined by sections 75 and 76 of Australia&#x27;s Constitution. Section 75 confers original jurisdiction in all matters:
Section 76 provides that Parliament may confer original jurisdiction in relation to matters:
Constitutional matters, referred to in section 76(i), were conferred on the High Court by section 30 of the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot;. Whilst it may seem that the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 means that the High Court&#x27;s original jurisdiction regarding constitutional matters could be removed, in practice section 75(iii) (suing the Commonwealth) and section 75(iv) (conflicts between states) are broad enough that many constitutional matters would still be within its jurisdiction. The original constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court is now well established; the Australian Law Reform Commission has described the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 rather than section 75 as &quot;an odd fact of history&quot;. The 1998 Constitutional Convention recommended an amendment to the constitution to prevent the possibility of the jurisdiction being removed by Parliament.

The word &quot;matter&quot; in sections 75 and 76 has been understood to mean that the High Court is unable to give advisory opinions.
===Appellate jurisdiction===
The court is empowered by section 73 of the Constitution to hear appeals from the supreme courts of the states and territories; as well as any court exercising federal jurisdiction. It may also hear appeals of decisions made in an exercise of its own original jurisdiction.

The High Court&#x27;s appellate jurisdiction is limited by the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot;, which requires special leave to be granted before the hearing of an appeal. Special leave may only be granted where a question of law is raised which is of public importance, involves a conflict between courts or &quot;is in the interests of the administration of justice&quot;.

Since November 2023, the High Court has adopted the practice of deciding the majority of special leave applications on the basis of written submissions only. In adopting this practice, the High Court also made the decision to publish decisions in special leave applications on its public website rather than in open court.

===Appeals to the Privy Council===

Appeals to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Privy Council were a notable controversy when the Constitution was drafted. Section 74 of the Constitution as it was put to voters, stated that there would be no appeals to the Privy Council in any matter involving the interpretation of the Constitution or state constitutions.

The section as enacted by the Imperial Parliament was different. It only prohibited appeals on constitutional disputes regarding the respective powers of the states and the Commonwealth (&quot;inter se&quot; matters), except where the High Court certified it appropriate for the appeal to be determined by Privy Council. This occurred only once, and the High Court has said it would never again grant a certificate of appeal. No certificate was required to appeal constitutional cases not involving &quot;inter se&quot; matters, such as in the interpretation of section 92 (the freedom of inter-state commerce section).

On non-&quot;inter se&quot; matters, the Privy Council regularly heard appeals against High Court decisions. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles. Other times it followed English authority, and overruled decisions of the High Court.

This arrangement led to tensions between the High Court and the Privy Council. In &quot;Parker v The Queen&quot; (1964), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment rejecting the authority of the House of Lords decision in &quot;DPP v Smith&quot;, writing, &quot;I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith&#x27;s case should not be used in Australia as authority at all.&quot; The Privy Council overturned this by enforcing the UK precedent upon the High Court the following year.

Thirteen High Court judges have heard cases as part of the Privy Council. Sir Isaac Isaacs is the only judge to have sat on an appeal from the High Court, in 1936 after his retirement as Governor-General of Australia. Sir Garfield Barwick insisted on an amendment to Privy Council procedure to allow dissent; however, he exercised that capacity only once. The appeals mostly related to decisions from other Commonwealth countries, although they occasionally included appeals from the supreme court of an Australian state.

==== Abolition of Privy Council appeals ====

Section 74 allowed parliament to prevent appeals to the Privy Council. It did so in 1968 with the &quot;Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968&quot;, which closed off all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation. In 1975, the &quot;Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act 1975&quot; closed all routes of appeal from the High Court; excepting for those in which a certificate of appeal would be granted by the High Court.

In 1986, with the passing of the &quot;Australia Act&quot; by both the UK Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliament (with the request and consent of the states&#x27; Parliaments), appeals to the Privy Council from state supreme courts were closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of appeal. In 2002, Chief Justice Murray Gleeson said that the &quot;combined effect&quot; of the legislation and the announcement in &quot;Kirmani&quot; &quot;has been that s 74 has become a dead letter, and what remains of s 74 after the legislation limiting appeals to the Privy Council will have no further effect&quot;.

===Appellate jurisdiction for Nauru===
On 6 September 1976, Australia and Nauru, which was newly-independent from Australia, signed an agreement for the High Court to become Nauru&#x27;s apex court. It was empowered to hear appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru in both criminal and civil cases, but not constitutional matters. There were a total of five appeals to the High Court under this agreement in the first 40 years of its operation. In 2017, however, this jumped to 13 appeals, most relating to asylum seekers. At the time some legal commentators argued that this appellate jurisdiction sat awkwardly with the High Court&#x27;s other responsibilities, and ought be renegotiated or repealed. Anomalies included the need to apply Nauruan law and customary practice, and that special leave hearings were not required.

Nauruan politicians had said publicly that the Nauru government was unhappy about these arrangements. Of particular concern was a decision of the High Court in October 2017, which quashed an increase in sentence imposed upon political protestors by the Supreme Court of Nauru. The High Court had remitted the case to the Supreme Court &quot;differently constituted, for hearing according to law&quot;.

On Nauru&#x27;s 50th anniversary of independence, Baron Waqa declared to parliament that &quot;[s]everance of ties to Australia&#x27;s highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood and an expression of confidence in Nauru&#x27;s ability to determine its own destiny&quot;. Justice Minister David Adeang said that an additional reason for cutting ties was the cost of appeals to the High Court. Nauru then exercised an option under its agreement with Australia to end its appellate arrangement with 90 days notice. The option was exercised on 12 December 2017 and the High Court&#x27;s jurisdiction ended on 12 March 2018. The termination did not become publicly known until after the Supreme Court had reheard the case of the protesters and had again imposed increased sentences. In 2022, Australia passed legislation which removed the possibility for reinstatement of the appeal pathway.

==History==

=== Pre-establishment ===
Following Earl Grey&#x27;s 1846 proposal to federate the colonies, an 1849 report from the Privy Council suggested a national court be created. In 1856, the Governor of South Australia, Richard MacDonnell, suggested to the Government of South Australia that they consider establishing a court to hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony. In 1860 the South Australian Parliament passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put the idea to the other colonies. However, only Victoria considered the proposal.

At a Melbourne inter-colonial conference held in 1870, the idea of an inter-colonial court was again raised. A royal commission was established in Victoria to investigate options for establishing such a court, and a draft bill was put forward. This draft bill, however, completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, causing a reaction in London which prevented any serious attempt to implement the bill through the British Imperial Parliament.

Another draft bill was proposed in 1880 for the establishment of an Australasian court of appeal. The proposed court would consist of one judge from each of the colonial supreme courts, who would serve one-year terms. However, the proposed court allowed for appeals to the Privy Council, which was disliked by some of the colonies, and the bill was abandoned.

====Constitutional conventions====

The idea of a federal supreme court was raised during the Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s. A proposal for a supreme court of Australia was included in an 1891 draft. It was proposed to enable the court to hear appeals from the state supreme courts, with appeals to the Privy Council only occurring on assent from the British monarch. It was proposed that the Privy Council be prevented from hearing appeals on constitutional matters.

This draft was largely the work of Sir Samuel Griffith, then the Premier of Queensland. The attorney-general of Tasmania Andrew Inglis Clark also contributed to the constitution&#x27;s judicial clauses. Clark&#x27;s most significant contribution was to give the court its own constitutional authority, ensuring a separation of powers. The original formulation of Griffith, Barton and Kingston provided only that the parliament could establish a court.

The draft was later amended at various conventions. In Adelaide the court&#x27;s proposed name was changed to be the &quot;High Court of Australia&quot;.

Many people opposed the idea of the new court completely replacing the Privy Council. Commercial interests, particularly subsidiaries of British companies preferred to operate under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. Others argued that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than those of the English, and than the inevitable divergence in law that would occur without the oversight of the Privy Council; would put the legal system at risk.

Some politicians (e.g. George Dibbs) supported a retention of Privy Council supervision; whereas others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite this debate, the draft&#x27;s judicial sections remained largely unchanged.

After the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899 for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. The issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point however; with objections made by Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, the Chief Justice of South Australia, Sir Samuel Way, and Samuel Griffith, among others. In October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offered alterations of his own. Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and Charles Kingston, although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.

After intense lobbying both in Australia and in the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally approved the draft constitution. The draft as passed included an alteration to section 74, in a compromise between the two sides. It allowed for a general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, but the Parliament of Australia could make laws restricting this avenue. In addition, appeals in &quot;inter se&quot; matters were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High Court.
====Formation of the court====
The High Court was not immediately established after Australia came into being. Some members of the first Parliament, including Sir John Quick, then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even H. B. Higgins, who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting it up, on the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it viable.

The then Attorney-General Alfred Deakin introduced the &quot;Judiciary Bill&quot; to the House of Representatives in 1902. Prior efforts had been continually delayed by opponents in the parliament, and the success of the bill is generally attributed to Deakin&#x27;s passion and persistence. Deakin proposed that the court be composed of five judges, specially selected to the court. Opponents instead proposed that the court should be made up of state supreme court justices, taking turns to sit on the High Court on a rotation basis, as had been mooted at the Constitutional Conventions a decade before. Deakin eventually negotiated amendments with the opposition, reducing the number of judges from five to three, and eliminating financial benefits such as pensions.

At one point, Deakin threatened to resign as Attorney-General due to the difficulties he faced. In his three and a half hour second reading speech to the House of Representatives, Deakin said,The federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power... It is properly termed the keystone of the federal arch... The statute stands and will stand on the statute-book just as in the hour in which it was assented to. But the nation lives, grows and expands. Its circumstances change, its needs alter, and its problems present themselves with new faces. [The High Court] enables the Constitution to grow and be adapted to the changeful necessities and circumstances of generation after generation that the High Court operates.
Deakin&#x27;s friend, painter Tom Roberts, who viewed the speech from the public gallery, declared it Deakin&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The Judiciary Act 1903 was finally passed on 25 August 1903, and the first three justices, Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith and justices Sir Edmund Barton and Richard O&#x27;Connor, were appointed on 5 October of that year. On 6 October, the court held its first sitting in the Banco Court in the Supreme Court of Victoria.

===Early years===
On 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five justices, and Deakin appointed H. B. Higgins and Isaac Isaacs to the High Court. Following a court-packing attempt by the Labor Prime Minister Andrew Fisher In February 1913, the bench was increased again to a total to seven. Charles Powers and Albert Bathurst Piddington were appointed. These appointments generated an outcry, however, and Piddington resigned on 5 April 1913 after serving only one month as High Court justice.
The High Court continued its Banco location in Melbourne until 1928, until a dedicated courtroom was built in Little Bourke Street, next to the Supreme Court of Victoria. That space provided the court&#x27;s Melbourne sitting place and housed the court&#x27;s principal until 1980. The court also sat regularly in Sydney, sharing space in the criminal courts of Darlinghurst Courthouse, before a dedicated courtroom was constructed next door in 1923.

The court travelled to other cities across the country, where it would use facilities of the respective supreme courts. Deakin had envisaged that the court would sit in many different locations, so as to truly be a federal court. Shortly after the court&#x27;s creation, Chief Justice Griffith established a schedule for sittings in state capitals: Hobart in February, Brisbane in June, Perth in September, and Adelaide in October. It has been said that Griffith established this schedule because those were the times of year he found the weather most pleasant in each city.

The tradition of special sittings remains to this day, although they are dependent on the court&#x27;s caseload. There are annual sittings in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for up to a week each year, and sittings in Hobart occur once every few years. Sittings outside of these special occurrences are conducted in Canberra.

The court&#x27;s operations were marked by various anomalies during World War II. The Chief Justice, Sir John Latham, served from 1940 to 1941 as Australia&#x27;s first ambassador to Japan; however, his activities in that role were limited by a pact Japan had entered with the Axis powers prior to his arrival in Tokyo. Owen Dixon was also absent for several years of his appointment, while serving as Australia&#x27;s minister to the United States in Washington. Sir George Rich acted as chief justice during Latham&#x27;s absence.

===Post-war period===
From 1952, with the appointment of Sir Owen Dixon as chief justice, the court entered a period of stability. After World War II, the court&#x27;s workload continued to grow, particularly from the 1960s onwards, putting pressures on the court. Sir Garfield Barwick, who was attorney-general from 1958 to 1964, and from then until 1981 chief justice, proposed that more federal courts be established, as permitted under the Constitution. In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia was established, with a general federal jurisdiction, and in more recent years the Family Court and Federal Magistrates Court have been set up to reduce the court&#x27;s workload in specific areas.

In 1968, appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation were barred. In 1986, with the passage of the Australia Acts direct appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were also closed off.

The life tenure of High Court justices ended in 1977. A national referendum in May 1977 approved the &quot;Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) 1977&quot;, which upon its commencement on 29 July 1977 amended section 72 of the Constitution so as require that all justices appointed from then on must retire on attaining the age of 70 years.

The &quot;High Court of Australia Act 1979&quot; (Cth), which commenced on 21 April 1980, gave the High Court power to administer its own affairs and prescribed the qualifications for, and method of appointment of, its Justices.

==Legal history==
Historical periods of the High Court are commonly denoted by reference to the chief justice of the time. However, the chief justice is not always the most influential figure on the Court.

=== Griffith court: 1903–1919 ===
The first court under Chief Justice Griffith laid the foundations of Australia&#x27;s constitutional law. The court was conscious of its position as Australia&#x27;s new court of appeal, and made efforts to establish its authority at the top of Australia&#x27;s court hierarchy. In &quot;Deakin v Webb&quot; (1904) It criticised the Victorian Supreme Court for following a Privy Council decision about the Constitution of Canada instead of its own authority.

In its early years Griffith and other federalists on the bench were dominant. Their decisions were occasionally at odds with nationalist judges such as Sir Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins in 1906. With the death of Justice Richard O&#x27;Connor, in 1912; the nationalists achieved majority and Griffith&#x27;s influence began to decline.

The early constitutional law decisions of the Griffith court was influenced by US constitutional law.

An important doctrine peculiar to the Griffith court was that of the reserved state powers. Under this doctrine, the Commonwealth parliament&#x27;s legislative powers were to be interpreted narrowly; so as to avoid intruding on areas of power traditionally exercised by the state Parliaments prior to federation. Anthony Mason has noted that this doctrine probably helped smooth the transition to a federal system of government and &quot;by preserving a balance between the constituent elements of the Australian federation, probably conformed to community sentiment, which at that stage was by no means adjusted to the exercise of central power&quot;.

Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton were frequently consulted by governors-general, including on the exercise of the reserve powers.

=== Knox, Isaacs and Gavan Duffy courts: 1919–1935 ===

==== Knox court ====
Adrian Knox became chief justice on 18 October 1919. Justice Edmund Barton died soon after, leaving no original members. During the Knox court, Justice Isaacs Isaacs had strong influence.

Under the Knox court the Engineers case was decided, ending the reserved state powers doctrine. The decision had lasting significance for the federal balance in Australia&#x27;s political arrangements. Another significant decision was &quot;Roche v Kronheimer&quot;, in which the court relied upon the defence power to uphold federal legislation seeking to implement Australia&#x27;s obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.

==== Isaacs court ====
Sir Isaac Isaacs was Chief Justice for only forty-two weeks; he left the court to be appointed governor-general. He was ill for most of his term, and few significant cases were decided in this time.

==== Duffy court ====
Sir Frank Gavan Duffy was Chief Justice for four years from 1931; but he was already 78 when appointed to the position. He was not influential, and only participated in 40% of the cases during his tenure. For the most part he gave short judgements, or joined in the judgements of his colleagues. His frequent absence resulted in many tied decisions which have no lasting value as precedent.

Important cases of this time include:

*&quot;Attorney-General (New South Wales) v Trethowan&quot;
*The First State Garnishee case
*&quot;Tuckiar v The King&quot;

=== Latham court: 1935–1952 ===

John Latham was elevated to Chief Justice in 1935. His tenure is most notable for the court&#x27;s interpretation of wartime legislation, and the subsequent transition back to peace.

Most legislation was upheld as enabled by the defence power. The Curtin Labor government&#x27;s legislation was rarely successfully challenged, with the court recognizing a necessity that the defence power permit the federal government to govern strongly.

The court allowed for the establishment of a national income tax scheme in the &quot;First Uniform Tax case&quot;, and upheld legislation declaring the pacifist Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses denomination to be a subversive organisation.

Following the war, the court reigned in the scope of the defence power. It struck down several key planks of the Chifley Labor government&#x27;s reconstruction program, notably an attempt to nationalise the banks in the Bank Nationalisation case (1948), and an attempt to establish a comprehensive medical benefits scheme in the First Pharmaceutical Benefits case (1945).

Other notable cases of the era include:

*The Communist Party case
*&quot;Proudman v Dayman&quot;
*&quot;R v Burgess; Ex parte Henry&quot;

=== Dixon court: 1952–1964 ===

Owen Dixon was appointed Chief Justice in 1952, after 23 years as a Justice on the court.

During his tenure the court experienced what some have described as a &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Dixon had strong influence on the court during this period. The court experienced a marked increase in the number of joint judgements, many of which were led by Dixon. The era has also been noted for the presence of generally good relations among the court&#x27;s judges.

Notable decisions of the Dixon court include:

*The &quot;Boilermakers&#x27; case&quot;
*&quot;Second Uniform Tax case&quot;

During Dixon&#x27;s time, the court came to adopt by majority several of the views he had expressed in minority years prior.

=== Barwick court: 1964–1981 ===

Garfield Barwick was appointed Chief Justice in 1964.

Among other things, the Barwick court is known for controversially deciding several cases on tax avoidance and tax evasion, almost always deciding against the taxation office. Led by Barwick himself in most judgments, the court distinguished between avoidance (legitimately minimising one&#x27;s tax obligations) and evasion (illegally evading obligations). The decisions effectively nullified the anti-avoidance legislation and led to the proliferation of avoidance schemes in the 1970s, a result which drew much criticism upon the court.

Notable decisions of the Barwick court include:

*&quot;Bradley v Commonwealth&quot;
*The Concrete Pipes case
*The Seas and Submerged Lands case
*The First and Second Territory Senators&#x27; cases
*&quot;Russell v Russell&quot;
*&quot;Cormack v Cope&quot;
*&quot;Victoria v Commonwealth&quot;

=== Gibbs court: 1981–1987 ===

Sir Harry Gibbs was appointed as Chief Justice in 1981.

Among the Gibbs court&#x27;s notable jurisprudence is an interpretive expansion of the Commonwealth&#x27;s legislative powers. Scholars have also noted a tendency away from the traditions of legalism and conservatism that characterised the Dixon and Barwick courts.

Notable decisions of the court include:

*&quot;Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen&quot;
*The Tasmanian Dams case
*&quot;Kioa v West&quot;
*The Chamberlain case
*&quot;A v Hayden&quot;

=== Mason court: 1987–1995 ===
Sir Anthony Mason became Chief Justice in 1987.

The Mason court is known for being one of the most legally liberal benches of the court. It was a notably stable court, with the only change in its bench being the appointment of McHugh following Wilson&#x27;s retirement.

Some of the decisions of the court in this time were politically controversial. Scholars have noted that the Mason court has tended to receive &quot;high praise and stringent criticism in equal measure&quot;.

Notable decisions of the court include:

*&quot;Cole v Whitfield&quot;
*&quot;Dietrich v The Queen&quot;
*&quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot;
*&quot;Polyukhovich v Commonwealth&quot;
*&quot;Sykes v Cleary&quot;
*&quot;Waltons Stores v Maher&quot; 
This era is also notable for originating Australia&#x27;s implied freedom of political communication jurisprudence; through the cases &quot;Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth&quot; and &quot;Theophanous&quot;.

=== Brennan court: 1995–1998 ===
Gerard Brennan succeeded Mason in 1995.

The court experienced many changes in members and significant cases in this three year period.

Notable decisions of the court include:

*&quot;Ha v New South Wales&quot;
*&quot;Grollo v Palmer&quot;
*&quot;Kable v DPP&quot;
*&quot;Lange v ABC&quot;
*The Wik case

=== Gleeson court: 1998–2008 ===
Murray Gleeson was appointed Chief Justice in 1998. The Gleeson Court has been regarded as a relatively conservative period of the court&#x27;s history.

Notable decisions of the court include:

*&quot;Al-Kateb v Godwin&quot;
*&quot;Egan v Willis&quot;
*&quot;New South Wales v Commonwealth&quot; (Workchoices Case)
*&quot;R v Tang&quot;
*&quot;Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally&quot;
*&quot;Sue v Hill&quot; 
*&quot;Western Australia v Ward&quot; 
*The &quot;Yorta Yorta case&quot;
=== French court: 2008–2017 ===
Robert French was appointed Chief Justice in September 2008.

Notable decisions of the French court include:

*&quot;Pape v Commissioner of Taxation&quot; 
*&quot;Plaintiff M70&quot; 
*&quot;Williams v Commonwealth&quot; 
=== Kiefel court: 2017–2023 ===
Susan Kiefel was appointed Chief Justice in January 2017.

Legal scholars have noted a shift in judicial style within the Kiefel court to one that attempts broad consensus. The frequency of dissenting judgements has decreased; and there have been relatively fewer decisions of a 4:3 split. Extrajudicially, Kiefel has expressed sympathy for judicial practices that maximise consensus and minimise dissent.

Additionally, it has been noted that Kiefel, Keane, and Bell frequently deliver a joint judgement when a unanimous consensus is not reached; often resulting in their decisions being determinative of the majority. This recent practice of the court has been criticised by the scholar Jeremy Gans, with comparisons drawn to the Four Horsemen era of the US Supreme Court.

Notable decisions of the Kiefel court include:

*&quot;Re Canavan&quot;&quot;&quot;
*&quot;Wilkie v Commonwealth&quot;
*&quot;AB v CD; EF v CD&quot;
*&quot;Pell v The Queen&quot;&quot;&quot;
*&quot;Love v Commonwealth&quot;
*&quot;Palmer v Western Australia&quot;

=== Gageler court: November 2023 – Present ===
Stephen Gageler was appointed Chief Justice in November 2023.

Notable decisions of the Gageler court include:

* &quot;NZYQ v Minister for Immigration&quot;
* &quot;Vanderstock v Victoria&quot;

==Appointment process, composition, and working conditions==
===Appointment process===
High Court Justices are appointed by the Governor-General in Council. The advice of the Council typically consists of the advice of the prime minister assisted by the Attorney-General for Australia. Advice from the attorney-general is legally required by implication, because since 1979 the attorney-general has been required by statute to consult the attorneys-general of the states (but not the territories). Some reformers have advocated for states to have a determinative role.

Originally, no particular qualifications for appointment to the High Court were required by the Constitution or by statute. The only constitutional requirement is still, since 1977, that the appointee be under the compulsory retirement age of 70. Further qualifications were introduced by statute in 1979: that an appointee be a judge of a federal, state or territory court; or have been an Australian legal practitioner for at least five years. Unlike members of the Parliament, it is not necessary to be an Australian Citizen and a member of the Court may be a dual citizen.

The appointment process has been relatively uncontroversial. This has, however, been due in part to the opacity of the process. There is no procedure for application, the only definite criteria are the minimal criteria above, and nothing is publicly known until an appointee is announced. Appointment to federal courts was extensively formalised in 2007, except for the High Court, and those reforms were reversed by the next federal government. Some recent attorneys-general have stated that they were consulting widelyto include, for instance, Australian Women Lawyers, the National Association of Commonwealth Legal Centres and the heads of Australian law schools. However, the nature of the attorney-general&#x27;s consultations remains almost wholly discretionary.

Some appointments to the High Court have displayed clear political influence. Three early justices had been conservative politicians prior to their appointment as chief justice; and justices Evatt, McTiernan, and Murphy were all Labor party politicians at some stage in their careers prior to being appointed to the High Court by a Labor prime minister.

===Composition===
The High Court has seven justicesthe chief justice and six others.

 the High Court has had 44 justices, twelve of whom have been chief justice.
==== Initial composition ====

The first High Court bench consisted of three justices: Samuel Griffith, Edmund Barton, and Richard O&#x27;Connor.

According to the contemporary press, among those considered and overlooked were Henry Higgins, Isaac Isaacs, Andrew Clark, John Downer, Josiah Symon, and George Wise.

Barton and O&#x27;Connor were both members of the federal parliament&#x27;s government bench. Each appointee had participated in the drafting of the Constitution. All three have been described as relatively conservative justices for the time, and were strongly influenced by law of the United States in their constitutional jurisprudence.

==== Expansion of the court ====
In 1906, at the request of the Justices, two seats were added to the bench, with Isaacs and Higgins being appointed.

After O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death in 1912, an amendment was made to the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot; expanding the bench to seven, which took place the following year.

Following Isaacs&#x27; retirement in 1931, his seat was left vacant, and an amendment to the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot; reduced the number of seats to six. This, however, led to some decisions being split three-all.

With the appointment of Justice Webb in 1946, the court returned to seven seats, and has had a full bench of seven justices since.

====Historical and Current demographics====
Only seven of the High Court&#x27;s fifty-six justices have been women.
The first female appointee to the bench was Mary Gaudron (who was a justice from 1987 to 2003), the second was Susan Crennan (who was a justice from 2005 to 2015), and the third Virginia Bell from 2009 to 2021. 

As of October 2022, for the first time there is now a female majority of the justices on the current bench with justices Kiefel, Gordon, Gleeson, and Jayne Jagot (as replacement for Patrick Keane)

In 2017, Justice Kiefel became the first woman to be appointed Chief Justice.

Michael Kirby was the first openly gay justice of the Court. He was replaced by Virginia Bell, who was the first lesbian justice on the bench.

Twenty-eight appointees have been residents of New South Wales, twenty-five of which graduated from Sydney Law School. Sixteen have come from Victoria, eight from Queensland, and four from Western Australia. No resident of South Australia, Tasmania, or any of the territories has ever been appointed to the bench.

The majority of justices have been of Protestant backgrounds, with a smaller number of a Catholic background. Two Jewish members have been appointed, Sir Isaac Isaacs and James Edelman, making them the only members of the court to have a faith background other than Christianity. However, many justices have refrained from commenting publicly upon their religious views.

Almost all judges on the High Court have taken silk in some form prior to their appointment, in the form of appointment to King&#x27;s Counsel (KC), Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) or Senior Counsel (SC). The exceptions are Starke, McTiernan, Webb, Walsh, Kirby, French, Edelman and Jagot.

Thirteen justices of the court previously served in a Parliament, however no previous parliamentarian has been appointed to the court since Lionel Murphy in 1975.

=== Working conditions ===
Salaries are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The regular justices receive $551,880, while the Chief justice receives $608,150. High Court judicial compensation is constitutionally protected from decrease during appointment.

The court typically sits for two weeks for each calendar month of the year, excepting for January and July in which no sitting days are held.

====Judicial associates====
Each judge engages associates for assistance in exercising their functions. The usual practice is to engage two associates simultaneously for a one-year term. Additionally, the chief justice is assisted by a legal research officer employed by the court library.

Associates have varying responsibilities; typically their work involves legal research, assistance in preparation for oral arguments, tipping in court during oral argument, editing judgments and assisting with extrajudicial functions, such as speech-writing. Associates are typically recruited after having graduated from an Australian law school with grades at or near the top of their class. Hundreds of applications for associate positions are received by the High Court annually.

Many High Court associates have gone on to illustrious careers. Examples of former associates include Nicola Roxon, Adrienne Stone and George Williams.

Three High Court justices served as associates prior to their elevation to the bench: Aickin to Dixon, Gageler to Mason, and Edelman to Toohey.

==Facilities==
===Building===

The High Court of Australia building is located on the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra&#x27;s Parliamentary Triangle. The High Court was designed between 1972 and 1974 by the Australian architect Christopher Kringas (1936–1975), a director of the firm Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Briggs. The building was constructed from 1975 to 1980. Its international architectural significance is recognised by the Union of International Architects register of Architectural Heritage of the 20th Century. It received the Australian Institute of Architects Canberra Medallion in 1980 and the award for Enduring Architecture in 2007. The High Court was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List in 2004.

===Online===
The High Court makes itself generally available to the public through its own website. Judgment alerts, available on the Court&#x27;s website and by email with free subscription, provide subscribers with notice of upcoming judgments (normally a week beforehand) and, almost immediately after the delivery of a major judgment, with a brief summary of it (normally not more than one page). All of the court&#x27;s judgments, as well as transcripts of its hearings since 2009 and other materials, are made available, free of charge, through the Australasian Legal Information Institute. The court has recently established on its website an &quot;eresources&quot; page, containing for each case its name, keywords, mentions of relevant legislation and a link to the full judgment; these links go to the original text from 2000 onward, scanned texts from 1948 to 1999 and facsimiles from the &quot;Commonwealth Law Reports&quot; for their first 100 volumes (1903 to 1959); there are also facsimiles of some unreported judgments (1906–2002). Since October 2013, audio-visual recordings of full-court hearings held in Canberra have been available on its website.

<text>Red Rabbit is a spy thriller novel, written by Tom Clancy and released on August 5, 2002. The plot occurs a few months after the events of &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1987), and incorporates the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II. Main character Jack Ryan, now an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency, takes part in the extraction of a Soviet defector who knows of a KGB plot to kill the pontiff. The book debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

==Plot summary==
In 1982, Pope John Paul II privately issues a letter to the communist Polish government, stating that he will resign from the papacy and return to his hometown unless they cease their repression of counterrevolutionary movements in Poland, particularly the Solidarity trade union. Called the Warsaw Letter, it is later forwarded to Moscow, enraging Committee for State Security (KGB) director Yuri Andropov. He decides to plan the Pope&#x27;s assassination, which he believes will reinvigorate communism in Eastern Europe, perceived by many to be in a state of decline. Known only by the number 15-8-82-666 for security reasons, the assassin is then selected as a Turk Muslim (understood to be Mehmet Ali Ağca), who would then be eliminated by Bulgarian KDS officer Boris Strokov afterwards for deniability. The operation is later unanimously approved by the Politburo.

Meanwhile, Oleg Zaitzev, a communications officer in the KGB tasked with sending and receiving encrypted dispatches to and from KGB stations across Europe, pieces together the plot to kill the Pope, and becomes deeply troubled with the prospect of murdering an innocent person for political purposes. He later decides to make contact with the local CIA station chief, Edward Foley, as well as his wife and agent Mary Pat, intending to defect and then be extracted out of the Soviet Union with his family, in exchange for providing information on the assassination plot as well as the names of KGB deep-penetration agents in the American and British governments.

The Foleys instruct Zaitzev to bring his family to Budapest, Hungary, under the guise of taking a vacation. They are then to be assisted by British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) officers stationed in the city, because the CIA station there is compromised; as a result, Jack Ryan, former Marine and the CIA liaison to SIS in London, is sent there to represent the agency. One early morning, the Zaitzevs are spirited out of the hotel they were staying. Accompanied by Ryan, they are then smuggled to Yugoslavia, where they immediately fly to the United Kingdom. SIS agents plant dead bodies that are physically identical to the family in their hotel room, which is then set on fire, thus deceiving the KGB.

After settling down in a safehouse outside Manchester, Zaitzev reveals what he knows about the assassination plot, which alarms the SIS and the CIA. Ryan is later sent to St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Vatican City to accompany the British SIS officers on the ground to ascertain how the attack on the Pope will play out, as well as to try capturing the shooter. At the Pope&#x27;s weekly audience, Ryan manages to capture Strokov; however, the Pope is shot by the real shooter, Ağca. Nevertheless, the pontiff recovers from his wounds. It is then revealed that Strokov was executed by the British as retaliation for murdering Soviet defector Georgi Markov on British soil four years ago.

==Characters==
* Oleg Ivanovich Zaitzev: Communications officer in the Committee for State Security, later a conscience defector to the United States (known in the CIA lexicon as &quot;Rabbit&quot;)
* Jack Ryan: Central Intelligence Agency liaison to the Secret Intelligence Service
* Yuri Vladimirovich Andropov: KGB chairman
* Colonel Boris Andreyevich Strokov: Bulgarian KDS intelligence officer working for the KGB
* Ed Foley: CIA chief of station in Moscow, under cover as embassy press attaché
* Mary Pat Foley: CIA operative, Ed Foley&#x27;s wife
* Sir Basil Charleston: Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service
* Simon Harding: SIS analyst who works directly with Ryan
* Arthur Moore: Director of Central Intelligence
* James Greer: CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence
* Robert Ritter: CIA Deputy Director of Operations. Distrustful of Ryan, an analyst, taking part in field operations.
* Cathy Ryan: Clinical instructor in ophthalmic surgery on an exchange program at St. Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London; Jack Ryan&#x27;s wife

==Themes==
&quot;Red Rabbit&quot; takes elements from Frederick Forsyth&#x27;s thriller novel &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), although the assassin &quot;is never so fully realized nor as sympathetic as the Jackal&quot;. Additionally in the novel, Clancy discusses the tradecraft of espionage, as well as life in Moscow before the fall of communism.

== Reception ==

The novel received mixed reviews. OAs Marc Cerasini stated in his essay on the novel: &quot;After the history-making events of September 11, 2001, a nostalgic trip back to the Cold War might not have been the novel Tom Clancy&#x27;s fans were anticipating.&quot; In a mixed review, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; derided the lack of suspense, which is &quot;a disappointment when other writers (Forsyth in &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot;, for one) have shown that there can be enough tension in a fated-to-fail assassination plot to give a stroke to a yoga master&quot;. The book was also notable for its disregard for real history, as CNN reminded that the events in &quot;Patriot Games&quot; occur after the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, which in turn occurs after the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.

Conversely, the book was praised for its &quot;believable and encyclopedic&quot; plot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s utterly fascinating to read Clancy&#x27;s playing out of that likely scenario—is there a writer in the world who brings so much verisimilitude to scenes both high (Politburo meetings) and low (details of spy craft and everyday Soviet life)?&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the book, stating: &quot;Clancy moves skillfully among a large cast of characters in Washington, London and Moscow, and develops many of them effectively. [His] writing has improved since the clunky prose and robotic dialogue of his early novels.&quot;

<text>Chemometrics is the science of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means. Chemometrics is inherently interdisciplinary, using methods frequently employed in core data-analytic disciplines such as multivariate statistics, applied mathematics, and computer science, in order to address problems in chemistry, biochemistry, medicine, biology and chemical engineering. In this way, it mirrors other interdisciplinary fields, such as psychometrics and econometrics.

==Background==
Chemometrics is applied to solve both descriptive and predictive problems in experimental natural sciences, especially in chemistry. In descriptive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of learning the underlying relationships and structure of the system (i.e., model understanding and identification). In predictive applications, properties of chemical systems are modeled with the intent of predicting new properties or behavior of interest. In both cases, the datasets can be small but are often large and complex, involving hundreds to thousands of variables, and hundreds to thousands of cases or observations.

Chemometric techniques are particularly heavily used in analytical chemistry and metabolomics, and the development of improved chemometric methods of analysis also continues to advance the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and methodology. It is an application-driven discipline, and thus while the standard chemometric methodologies are very widely used industrially, academic groups are dedicated to the continued development of chemometric theory, method and application development.

==Origins==
Although one could argue that even the earliest analytical experiments in chemistry involved a form of chemometrics, the field is generally recognized to have emerged in the 1970s as computers became increasingly exploited for scientific investigation. The term &#x27;chemometrics&#x27; was coined by Svante Wold in a 1971 grant application, and the International Chemometrics Society was formed shortly thereafter by Svante Wold and Bruce Kowalski, two pioneers in the field. Wold was a professor of organic chemistry at Umeå University, Sweden, and Kowalski was a professor of analytical chemistry at University of Washington, Seattle.

Many early applications involved multivariate classification, numerous quantitative predictive applications followed, and by the late 1970s and early 1980s a wide variety of data- and computer-driven chemical analyses were occurring.
Multivariate analysis was a critical facet even in the earliest applications of chemometrics. Data from infrared and UV/visible spectroscopy are often counted in thousands of measurements per sample. Mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic emission/absorption and chromatography experiments are also all by nature highly multivariate. The structure of these data was found to be conducive to using techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA), partial least-squares (PLS), orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS), and two-way orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS). This is primarily because, while the datasets may be highly multivariate there is strong and often linear low-rank structure present. PCA and PLS have been shown over time very effective at empirically modeling the more chemically interesting low-rank structure, exploiting the interrelationships or &#x27;latent variables&#x27; in the data, and providing alternative compact coordinate systems for further numerical analysis such as regression, clustering, and pattern recognition. Partial least squares in particular was heavily used in chemometric applications for many years before it began to find regular use in other fields.

Through the 1980s three dedicated journals appeared in the field: &quot;Journal of Chemometrics&quot;, &quot;Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&quot;. These journals continue to cover both fundamental and methodological research in chemometrics. At present, most routine applications of existing chemometric methods are commonly published in application-oriented journals (e.g., &quot;Applied Spectroscopy&quot;, &quot;Analytical Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Analytica Chimica Acta&quot;, &quot;Talanta&quot;). Several important books/monographs on chemometrics were also first published in the 1980s, including the first edition of Malinowski&#x27;s &quot;Factor Analysis in Chemistry&quot;, Sharaf, Illman and Kowalski&#x27;s &quot;Chemometrics&quot;, Massart et al. &quot;Chemometrics: a textbook&quot;, and &quot;Multivariate Calibration&quot; by Martens and Naes.

Some large chemometric application areas have gone on to represent new domains, such as molecular modeling and QSAR, cheminformatics, the &#x27;-omics&#x27; fields of genomics, proteomics, metabonomics and metabolomics, process modeling and process analytical technology.

An account of the early history of chemometrics was published as a series of interviews by Geladi and Esbensen.

==Techniques==

===Multivariate calibration===
Many chemical problems and applications of chemometrics involve calibration. The objective is to develop models which can be used to predict properties of interest based on measured properties of the chemical system, such as pressure, flow, temperature, infrared, Raman, NMR spectra and mass spectra. Examples include the development of multivariate models relating 1) multi-wavelength spectral response to analyte concentration, 2) molecular descriptors to biological activity, 3) multivariate process conditions/states to final product attributes. The process requires a calibration or training data set, which includes reference values for the properties of interest for prediction, and the measured attributes believed to correspond to these properties. For case 1), for example, one can assemble data from a number of samples, including concentrations for an analyte of interest for each sample (the reference) and the corresponding infrared spectrum of that sample. Multivariate calibration techniques such as partial-least squares regression, or principal component regression (and near countless other methods) are then used to construct a mathematical model that relates the multivariate response (spectrum) to the concentration of the analyte of interest, and such a model can be used to efficiently predict the concentrations of new samples.

Techniques in multivariate calibration are often broadly categorized as classical or inverse methods. The principal difference between these approaches is that in classical calibration the models are solved such that they are optimal in describing the measured analytical responses (e.g., spectra) and can therefore be considered optimal descriptors, whereas in inverse methods the models are solved to be optimal in predicting the properties of interest (e.g., concentrations, optimal predictors). Inverse methods usually require less physical knowledge of the chemical system, and at least in theory provide superior predictions in the mean-squared error sense, and hence inverse approaches tend to be more frequently applied in contemporary multivariate calibration.

The main advantages of the use of multivariate calibration techniques is that fast, cheap, or non-destructive analytical measurements (such as optical spectroscopy) can be used to estimate sample properties which would otherwise require time-consuming, expensive or destructive testing (such as LC-MS). Equally important is that multivariate calibration allows for accurate quantitative analysis in the presence of heavy interference by other analytes. The selectivity of the analytical method is provided as much by the mathematical calibration, as the analytical measurement modalities. For example, near-infrared spectra, which are extremely broad and non-selective compared to other analytical techniques (such as infrared or Raman spectra), can often be used successfully in conjunction with carefully developed multivariate calibration methods to predict concentrations of analytes in very complex matrices.

===Classification, pattern recognition, clustering===
Supervised multivariate classification techniques are closely related to multivariate calibration techniques in that a calibration or training set is used to develop a mathematical model capable of classifying future samples. The techniques employed in chemometrics are similar to those used in other fields – multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, neural networks, regression/classification trees. The use of rank reduction techniques in conjunction with these conventional classification methods is routine in chemometrics, for example discriminant analysis on principal components or partial least squares scores.

A family of techniques, referred to as class-modelling or one-class classifiers, are able to build models for an individual class of interest. Such methods are particularly useful in the case of quality control and authenticity verification of products.

Unsupervised classification (also termed cluster analysis) is also commonly used to discover patterns in complex data sets, and again many of the core techniques used in chemometrics are common to other fields such as machine learning and statistical learning.

===Multivariate curve resolution===
In chemometric parlance, multivariate curve resolution seeks to deconstruct data sets with limited or absent reference information and system knowledge. Some of the earliest work on these techniques was done by Lawton and Sylvestre in the early 1970s. These approaches are also called self-modeling mixture analysis, blind source/signal separation, and spectral unmixing. For example, from a data set comprising fluorescence spectra from a series of samples each containing multiple fluorophores, multivariate curve resolution methods can be used to extract the fluorescence spectra of the individual fluorophores, along with their relative concentrations in each of the samples, essentially unmixing the total fluorescence spectrum into the contributions from the individual components. The problem is usually ill-determined due to rotational ambiguity (many possible solutions can equivalently represent the measured data), so the application of additional constraints is common, such as non-negativity, unimodality, or known interrelationships between the individual components (e.g., kinetic or mass-balance constraints).

===Other techniques===
Experimental design remains a core area of study in chemometrics and several monographs are specifically devoted to experimental design in chemical applications. Sound principles of experimental design have been widely adopted within the chemometrics community, although many complex experiments are purely observational, and there can be little control over the properties and interrelationships of the samples and sample properties.

Signal processing is also a critical component of almost all chemometric applications, particularly the use of signal pretreatments to condition data prior to calibration or classification. The techniques employed commonly in chemometrics are often closely related to those used in related fields. Signal pre-processing may affect the way in which outcomes of the final data processing can be interpreted.

Performance characterization, and figures of merit Like most arenas in the physical sciences, chemometrics is quantitatively oriented, so considerable emphasis is placed on performance characterization, model selection, verification &amp; validation, and figures of merit. The performance of quantitative models is usually specified by root mean squared error in predicting the attribute of interest, and the performance of classifiers as a true-positive rate/false-positive rate pairs (or a full ROC curve). A recent report by Olivieri et al. provides a comprehensive overview of figures of merit and uncertainty estimation in multivariate calibration, including multivariate definitions of selectivity, sensitivity, SNR and prediction interval estimation. Chemometric model selection usually involves the use of tools such as resampling (including bootstrap, permutation, cross-validation).

Multivariate statistical process control (MSPC), modeling and optimization accounts for a substantial amount of historical chemometric development. Spectroscopy has been used successfully for online monitoring of manufacturing processes for 30–40 years, and this process data is highly amenable to chemometric modeling. Specifically in terms of MSPC, multiway modeling of batch and continuous processes is increasingly common in industry and remains an active area of research in chemometrics and chemical engineering. Process analytical chemistry as it was originally termed, or the newer term process analytical technology continues to draw heavily on chemometric methods and MSPC.

Multiway methods are heavily used in chemometric applications. These are higher-order extensions of more widely used methods. For example, while the analysis of a table (matrix, or second-order array) of data is routine in several fields, multiway methods are applied to data sets that involve 3rd, 4th, or higher-orders. Data of this type is very common in chemistry, for example a liquid-chromatography / mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system generates a large matrix of data (elution time versus m/z) for each sample analyzed. The data across multiple samples thus comprises a data cube. Batch process modeling involves data sets that have time vs. process variables vs. batch number. The multiway mathematical methods applied to these sorts of problems include PARAFAC, trilinear decomposition, and multiway PLS and PCA.

<doc id="314205" wikidata="Q1068675" url="?curid=314205" title="Polynomial long division">
<text>In algebra, polynomial long division is an algorithm for dividing a polynomial by another polynomial of the same or lower degree, a generalized version of the familiar arithmetic technique called long division. It can be done easily by hand, because it separates an otherwise complex division problem into smaller ones. Sometimes using a shorthand version called synthetic division is faster, with less writing and fewer calculations. Another abbreviated method is polynomial short division (Blomqvist&#x27;s method).

Polynomial long division is an algorithm that implements the Euclidean division of polynomials, which starting from two polynomials &quot;A&quot; (the &quot;dividend&quot;) and &quot;B&quot; (the &quot;divisor&quot;) produces, if &quot;B&quot; is not zero, a &quot;quotient&quot; &quot;Q&quot; and a &quot;remainder&quot; &quot;R&quot; such that
:&quot;A&quot; = &quot;BQ&quot; + &quot;R&quot;,
and either &quot;R&quot; = 0 or the degree of &quot;R&quot; is lower than the degree of &quot;B&quot;. These conditions uniquely define &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, which means that &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot; do not depend on the method used to compute them.

The result &quot;R&quot; = 0 occurs if and only if the polynomial &quot;A&quot; has &quot;B&quot; as a factor. Thus long division is a means for testing whether one polynomial has another as a factor, and, if it does, for factoring it out. For example, if a root &quot;r&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is known, it can be factored out by dividing &quot;A&quot; by (&quot;x&quot; – &quot;r&quot;).

==Example==

=== Polynomial long division ===
Find the quotient and the remainder of the division of formula_1, the &quot;dividend&quot;, by formula_2, the &quot;divisor&quot;.

The dividend is first rewritten like this:

:formula_3

The quotient and remainder can then be determined as follows:

The polynomial above the bar is the quotient &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and the number left over (5) is the remainder &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

:formula_4

The long division algorithm for arithmetic is very similar to the above algorithm, in which the variable &quot;x&quot; is replaced (in base 10) by the specific number 10.

=== Polynomial short division===
Blomqvist&#x27;s method is an abbreviated version of the long division above. This pen-and-paper method uses the same algorithm as polynomial long division, but mental calculation is used to determine remainders. This requires less writing, and can therefore be a faster method once mastered.

The division is at first written in a similar way as long multiplication with the dividend at the top, and the divisor below it. The quotient is to be written below the bar from left to right.

:formula_5

Divide the first term of the dividend by the highest term of the divisor (&quot;x&quot;3 ÷ &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;2). Place the result below the bar. &quot;x&quot;3 has been divided leaving no remainder, and can therefore be marked as used by crossing it out. The result &quot;x&quot;2 is then multiplied by the second term in the divisor −3 = −3&quot;x&quot;2. Determine the partial remainder by subtracting −2&quot;x&quot;2 − (−3&quot;x&quot;2) = &quot;x&quot;2. Mark −2&quot;x&quot;2 as used and place the new remainder &quot;x&quot;2 above it.

:formula_6

Divide the highest term of the remainder by the highest term of the divisor (&quot;x&quot;2 ÷ &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;). Place the result (+x) below the bar. &quot;x&quot;2 has been divided leaving no remainder, and can therefore be marked as used. The result &quot;x&quot; is then multiplied by the second term in the divisor −3 = −3&quot;x&quot;. Determine the partial remainder by subtracting 0&quot;x&quot; − (−3&quot;x&quot;) = 3&quot;x&quot;. Mark 0&quot;x&quot; as used and place the new remainder 3&quot;x&quot; above it.

:formula_7

Divide the highest term of the remainder by the highest term of the divisor (3x ÷ &quot;x&quot; = 3). Place the result (+3) below the bar. 3x has been divided leaving no remainder, and can therefore be marked as used. The result 3 is then multiplied by the second term in the divisor −3 = −9. Determine the partial remainder by subtracting −4 − (−9) = 5. Mark −4 as used and place the new remainder 5 above it.

:formula_8

The polynomial below the bar is the quotient &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and the number left over (5) is the remainder &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

==Pseudocode==

The algorithm can be represented in pseudocode as follows, where +, −, and × represent polynomial arithmetic, and lead(r) / lead(d) represents the polynomial obtained by dividing the two leading terms:

 function n / d is
 require d ≠ 0
 q ← 0
 r ← n // At each step n = d × q + r
 while r ≠ 0 and degree(r) ≥ degree(d) do
 t ← lead(r) / lead(d) // Divide the leading terms
 q ← q + t
 r ← r − t × d
 return (q, r)

This works equally well when degree(&quot;n&quot;) &lt; degree(&quot;d&quot;); in that case the result is just the trivial (0, &quot;n&quot;).

This algorithm describes exactly the above paper and pencil method: is written on the left of the &quot;)&quot;; is written, term after term, above the horizontal line, the last term being the value of ; the region under the horizontal line is used to compute and write down the successive values of .

== Euclidean division ==
For every pair of polynomials (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) such that &quot;B&quot; ≠ 0, polynomial division provides a &quot;quotient&quot; &quot;Q&quot; and a &quot;remainder&quot; &quot;R&quot; such that 
:formula_9
and either &quot;R&quot;=0 or degree(&quot;R&quot;) &lt; degree(&quot;B&quot;). Moreover (&quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) is the unique pair of polynomials having this property.

The process of getting the uniquely defined polynomials &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;R&quot; from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is called &quot;Euclidean division&quot; (sometimes &quot;division transformation&quot;). Polynomial long division is thus an algorithm for Euclidean division.

==Applications==

===Factoring polynomials===

Sometimes one or more roots of a polynomial are known, perhaps having been found using the rational root theorem. If one root &quot;r&quot; of a polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) of degree &quot;n&quot; is known then polynomial long division can be used to factor &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) into the form where &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is a polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; − 1. &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is simply the quotient obtained from the division process; since &quot;r&quot; is known to be a root of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), it is known that the remainder must be zero.

Likewise, if several roots &quot;r&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, . . . of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) are known, a linear factor can be divided out to obtain &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and then can be divided out of &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), etc. Alternatively, the quadratic factor formula_10 can be divided out of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to obtain a quotient of degree 

This method is especially useful for cubic polynomials, and sometimes all the roots of a higher-degree polynomial can be obtained. For example, if the rational root theorem produces a single (rational) root of a quintic polynomial, it can be factored out to obtain a quartic (fourth degree) quotient; the explicit formula for the roots of a quartic polynomial can then be used to find the other four roots of the quintic. There is, however, no general way to solve a quintic by purely algebraic methods, see Abel–Ruffini theorem.

===Finding tangents to polynomial functions===

Polynomial long division can be used to find the equation of the line that is tangent to the graph of the function defined by the polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) at a particular point If &quot;R&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the remainder of the division of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) by then the equation of the tangent line at to the graph of the function is regardless of whether or not &quot;r&quot; is a root of the polynomial.

====Example====
Find the equation of the line that is tangent to the following curve
formula_11
:at: formula_12
Begin by dividing the polynomial by:
formula_13

: formula_14
The tangent line is 
formula_15

===Cyclic redundancy check===

A cyclic redundancy check uses the remainder of polynomial division to detect errors in transmitted messages.

<doc id="314206" wikidata="Q6575506" url="?curid=314206" title="List of justices of the High Court of Australia">
<text>The High Court of Australia is composed of seven justices: the chief justice of Australia and six other justices. There have been 57 justices who have served as justices of the High Court since its formation under the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot;. Under Section 71 of the Australian Constitution, the judicial power of the Commonwealth of Australia is vested in the court, and it has been the highest court in the Australian court hierarchy since the passing of the &quot;Australia Act 1986&quot;.

In a May 2017 speech, Justice Virginia Bell observed that &quot;few Australians outside the law schools are likely to be able to name the Chief Justice, let alone the puisne justices of the High Court&quot;.

==History==
Initially, there were three justices of the High Court – Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith, Justice Sir Edmund Barton and Justice Richard Edward O&#x27;Connor. The number was expanded in 1906, at the request of the justices, to five, with the appointment of Justices Sir Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins. After O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death in 1912, an amendment to the &quot;Judiciary Act 1903&quot; expanded the bench to seven. For most of 1930, two seats were left vacant due to monetary constraints placed on the court by the Depression. The economic downturn had also led to a reduction in litigation and consequently less work for the court. After Isaacs retired in 1931, his seat was left empty, and in 1933 an amendment to the &quot;Judiciary Act&quot; officially reduced the number of seats to six. However, this led to some decisions being split three-all. With the appointment of William Webb in 1946, the number of seats returned to seven, and since then the court has had seven justices. there have been 55 justices, 13 of whom have been chief justice.

Appointments to the court were for life until 1977, when a mandatory retirement age of 70 was established, though several post-1977 justices have retired before reaching the age of 70 (William Deane resigned as a justice to be appointed governor-general).

==Composition of the High Court==
There have been 57 justices of the High Court; fifty have been men and seven women. The first female justice was Mary Gaudron who was a justice from 1987 to 2003. Susan Crennan was a justice from 2005 to 2015, and Virginia Bell from 2009 to 2021. Susan Kiefel was the first woman to be appointed Chief Justice of Australia. She was appointed in 2017 and had been a justice from 2007 to 2017. Of the seven current justices, four are men, including the chief justice, and three are women. Michelle Gordon was appointed in 2015 and Jacqueline Gleeson in 2021, replacing Bell. Jayne Jagot replaced Justice Keane on the court in 2022, giving women a majority on the High Court for a period of just over a year.

Thirteen politicians, serving or former, have been appointed to the High Court of Australia. Nine justices have served in the Parliament of Australia: Edmund Barton, Richard O&#x27;Connor, Isaac Isaacs, H. B. Higgins, Edward McTiernan, H. V. Evatt, John Latham, Garfield Barwick, and Lionel Murphy. All but Evatt were appointed after their parliamentary service; Evatt resigned from the bench in order to pursue his federal political career, although he had previously served in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. In addition to the above, four justices served in colonial parliaments: Samuel Griffith, Charles Powers, Albert Piddington and Adrian Knox, although all concluded their political careers more than 10 years prior to their appointments. The most recent justice to serve in state or federal parliament is Lionel Murphy.

The majority of justices have come from the eastern states, particularly New South Wales (29 justices), Victoria (16 justices) and Queensland Queensland (8 justices). It was not until 1979 that a justice was appointed from Western Australia. There has never been a justice from South Australia. Robert Beech-Jones was born in Tasmania but went to university in Canberra and spent most of his career in Sydney.

Most justices had previously served as judges of other Australian courts prior to their appointment to the High Court. Prior to the creation of the Federal Court of Australia in 1976, this was primarily the Supreme Courts of the States. Since 1976, a number of justices of the Federal Court have been appointed to the High Court. A small number of justices served on both a State Supreme Court and the Federal Court before being appointed to the High Court.

==List of justices==
The current judges are listed in bold on the table below.

==Seats of the High Court==
This following chart illustrates the composition of the High Court. It indicates the seven seats of the court, and who has occupied each seat at different points in the court&#x27;s existence. The red portions represent the future part of a judge&#x27;s term and show the date at which they are bound to retire from the court (although they may choose to retire before that date). The blue portions of a judge&#x27;s term show a period in which that judge was chief justice.

<doc id="314208" wikidata="Q210450" url="?curid=314208" title="Lasithi">
<text>Lasithi () is the easternmost regional unit on the island of Crete, to the east of Heraklion. Its capital is Agios Nikolaos, the other major towns being Ierapetra and Sitia. The mountains include the Dikti in the west and the Thrypti in the east. The Sea of Crete lies to the north and the Libyan Sea to the south.

To the east of the village of Elounda lies the island of Spinalonga, formerly a Venetian fortress and a leper colony. On the foot of Mount Dikti lies the Lasithi Plateau, famous for its windmills. Vai is well known for its datepalm forest.

Thanks to its beaches and its mild climate year-long, Lasithi attracts many tourists. Mass tourism is served by places like Vai, Agios Nikolaos and the island of Chrissi. More off-beat tourism can be found in villages on the south coast like Myrtos, Makrys Gialos or Makrigialos, Xerokambos and Koutsouras.

Lasithi is home to a number of ancient remains. Vasiliki, Fournou Korifi, Pyrgos, Zakros and Gournia are ruins of Minoan date, Lato and Itanos were Doric towns.

==History==
The history of Lasithi can be traced over at least three millennia. The region has considerable ancient history antecedents, including the Dorian era settlement of Olous and Lato.
==Name==
It has been speculated that &quot;ra-su-to&quot;, found in Linear B, corresponds to an unattested ancient &quot;Lasynthos&quot;. There is also a Lyttian tribal name &quot;Lasynthioi&quot;, presumably reflecting the same name.

Earlier proposals that it is derived from a Venetian &#x27;la&#x27; preposed to derivatives of &quot;Lyttos&quot; (&quot;Lyttus&quot; &gt; &quot;Tselyttus&quot; &gt; &quot;Tselethe&quot; &gt; &quot;Xeethe&quot; &gt; &quot;La Xeethi&quot; &gt; &quot;Lasithi&quot;) or &quot;Sitia&quot; (&quot;Sitia&quot; &gt; &quot;La Sitia&quot; &gt; &quot;Lasithi&quot;) are unlikely, as the name Lasithi was attested as early as 1211, whereas the Venetians only first arrived in Crete in 1205. Another unlikely etymology derives it from &quot;lakkos&quot; &#x27;hole or basin&#x27; (&quot;Lakkos&quot; &gt; &quot;Lakkidion&quot; &gt; &quot;Latsidi&quot; &gt; &quot;Lasidi&quot; &gt; &quot;Lasithi&quot;).

The area was known as Laşid () under Turkish rule.

==Administration==

The regional unit Lasithi is subdivided into four municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):

*Agios Nikolaos (1)
*Ierapetra (2)
*Oropedio Lasithiou (3)
*Siteia (4)

===Prefecture===

As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Lasithi was created out of the former prefecture of Lasithi (), which was created while Crete was still an autonomous state and was retained after the island joined Greece in 1913. The prefecture had the same territory as the present regional unit, except Viannos area that belonged to Lasithi but was annexed to Heraklion prefecture in 1932. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.

===Provinces===

Before 2006, Lasithi was divided into 4 provinces: 
*Province of Mirambelos - Neapolis
*Province of Lasithi - Tzermiado
*Province of Ierapetra - Ierapetra
*Province of Sitia - Sitia

<doc id="314227" wikidata="Q217024" url="?curid=314227" title="Leap year starting on Monday">
<text>A leap year starting on Monday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Monday, 1 January, and ends on Tuesday, 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are GF. The most recent year of such kind was 2024, and the next one will be 2052 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2008 and 2036 in the obsolete Julian calendar.

Any leap year that starts on Monday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this leap year occur in September and December. Common years starting on Tuesday share this characteristic.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Monday, along with those starting on Saturday and Thursday, occur least frequently: 13 out of 97 (≈ 13.4%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Their overall frequency is thus 3.25% (13 out of 400) of years.

=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Monday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<text>Shimon bar Yochai (Zoharic Aramaic: , &quot;Šimʿon bar Yoḥay&quot;) or Shimon ben Yochai (Mishnaic Hebrew: ), also known by the acronym Rashbi, was a 2nd-century tanna or sage of the period of Roman Judaea and early Syria Palaestina. He was one of the most eminent disciples of Rabbi Akiva. The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a 13th-century foundational work of Kabbalah, is ascribed to him by Kabbalistic tradition, but this claim is universally rejected by modern scholars.

In addition, the essential legal works called the &quot;Sifre&quot; and &quot;Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai&quot; are attributed to him (not to be confused with the &quot;Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael&quot;, of which much of the text is the same). In the Mishnah, where he is the fourth-most mentioned sage, he is referred to as simply &quot;Rabbi Shimon&quot; except in Hagigah 1:7. In baraitas, midrash, and gemara, his name occurs either as Shimon or as Shimon ben Yochai. An 8th-century pseudonymous attribution of divine revelations to Shimon by the angel Metatron is also known, called &quot;The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai&quot;.

According to modern legend, he and his son, Eleazar ben Simeon, were noted Kabbalists. Baruch Kranz denies this claim. Both figures are held in unique reverence by Kabbalistic tradition. By tradition, they were buried in the same tomb in Meron, Israel, which is visited by thousands year-round.

==Biography==

Shimon was born in the Galilee. He was one of the principal pupils of Rabbi Akiva, under whom he studied 13 years at Bnei Brak.

Berakhot 28a relates that Shimon had previously studied at Yavne, under Gamaliel II and Joshua ben Hananiah, and that he was the cause of the infamous quarrel that broke out between these two leaders. However, this statement is somewhat chronologically difficult, considering that about forty-five years later, when Akiva was thrown into prison, Shimon&#x27;s father was still alive. Zecharias Frankel thus concluded the account in Berakhot 28a is spurious.

In the Jerusalem Talmud, in Terumot 46b and Sanhedrin 1:19a, Shimon&#x27;s acuteness was tested and recognized by Aqiva when he first came to him; of all his pupils Aqiva ordained only Rabbi Meir and Shimon. Conscious of his merit, Shimon felt hurt at being ranked after Meir, and Aqiva was compelled to soothe him with soft words.

During Akiva&#x27;s lifetime, Shimon was occasionally found at Sidon, where he seems to have shown great independence in his halakhic decisions.

The following incident is recorded, illustrating his wit and piety: A man and his wife, childless despite ten years of marriage, appeared before Shimon at Sidon to secure a divorce. Observing that they loved each other and not being able to refuse a request that agreed with rabbinical law, Shimon told them that as a feast marked their wedding, they should mark their separation in the same way. The result was that both changed their minds and, owing to Shimon&#x27;s prayer, God granted them a child.

Shimon often returned to Akiva, and once he conveyed a message to him from his fellow pupil Hanina ben Hakinai. Shimon&#x27;s love for his great teacher was profound. When Akiva was thrown into prison by Hadrian, Shimon (probably through the influence of his father, who was in favor at the court of Rome) found a way to enter the prison. He still insisted upon Akiva&#x27;s teaching him, and when the latter refused, Shimon jestingly threatened to tell his father, Yochai, who would cause Akiva to be punished more severely. After Akiva&#x27;s death, Shimon was again ordained, with four other pupils of Akiva, by Judah ben Baba.

===Legends of persecution and hiding===
The persecution of the Jews under Hadrian inspired Shimon with a different opinion of the Romans than that held by his father. Shimon often demonstrated his anti-Roman feeling. When, at a meeting between Shimon and his former fellow pupils at Usha, probably about a year and a half after Akiva&#x27;s death (c. 126), Judah bar Ilai spoke in praise of the Roman government, Shimon replied that the institutions which seemed so praiseworthy to Judah were for the benefit of the Romans only, to facilitate the carrying out of their wicked designs. Shimon&#x27;s words were carried by Judah b. Gerim (one of his pupils) to the Roman governor, who sentenced Shimon to death (according to Grätz, this governor was Varus, who ruled under Antoninus Pius, and the event took place about 161). Shimon was compelled to seek refuge in a cavern, where he remained for thirteen years till the emperor, possibly Antoninus Pius, who reigned until 161, died.

Shimon, accompanied by his son Eleazar, hid in a cavern near Gadara, where they stayed for thirteen years, living on dates and carob fruit. Their whole bodies thus became covered with eruptions. One day, seeing that a bird had repeatedly escaped the net set for it by a hunter, Shimon and his son were encouraged to leave the cavern, taking the escape of the bird as an omen that God would not forsake them. When outside the cavern, they heard the voice of God say, &quot;You are free&quot;; they accordingly went their way. Shimon then bathed in the warm springs of Tiberias, which rid him of the disease contracted in the cavern, and he showed his gratitude to the town in the following manner:

Tiberias had been built by Herod Antipas on a site where there were many tombs, the exact locations of which had been lost. The town, therefore, had been regarded as unclean. Resolving to remove the cause of the uncleanness, Shimon planted lupines in all suspected places; wherever they did not take root, he knew that a tomb was underneath. The bodies were then exhumed and removed, and the town pronounced clean. A certain Samaritan secretly replaced one of the bodies to annoy and discredit Shimon. But Shimon learned what the Samaritan had done through the power of the Holy Spirit and said, &quot;Let what is above go down, and what is below come up.&quot; The Samaritan was entombed, and a schoolmaster of Magdala who mocked Shimon for his declaration, was turned into a heap of bones.

To spare their garments, they sat naked in the sand, consequently covering their skin with scabs. At the end of twelve years, the prophet Elijah announced to them the death of the Roman emperor and the consequent annulment of the sentence of death against them. When they came forth, Shimon observed people occupied with agricultural pursuits to neglect the Torah and, being angered thereby, smote them with his glances. The voice of God then ordered him to return to the cavern, where he and Eleazar remained twelve months longer, at the end of which time God ordered them to come forth. When they did so, Shimon was met by his son-in-law Phinehas ben Jair who wept at seeing him in such a miserable state. However, Shimon told him that he ought to rejoice, for during the thirteen years&#x27; stay in the cavern, his knowledge of the Torah had been much increased. In gratitude for the miracle that had been wrought for him, Shimon then undertook the purification of Tiberias. He threw some lupines into the ground, whereupon the bodies came to the surface at various places, then marked as tombs. Not only was the man who mocked at Shimon&#x27;s announcement of the purification of Tiberias turned into a heap of bones, but also Shimon&#x27;s pupil and delator, Judah b. Gerim.

===Later stories===
It appears that Shimon settled afterward at Meron, the valley in front of which place was filled, with dinars at Shimon&#x27;s command. On the other hand, it is said that Shimon established a flourishing school at Tekoa, among the pupils of which was Judah I. Grätz demonstrated that this Tekoa evidently was in Galilee, and hence must not be identified with the Biblical Tekoa, which was in the territory of Judah. Bacher argues that Tekoa and Meron were the same place.

As the last significant event in Shimon&#x27;s life, it is said that he was sent to Rome (accompanied by Eleazar ben Jose) with a petition to the emperor for the abolition of the decree against the three Jewish observances and that his mission was successful. It is stated that Shimon was chosen for this mission because he was known as a man in whose favor miracles often were wrought. At Rome, too, Shimon&#x27;s success was due to a miracle, for while on the way he was met by the demon Ben Temalion, who offered his assistance. According to agreement, the demon entered the emperor&#x27;s daughter, and Shimon exorcised it when he arrived at the Roman court. The emperor then took Shimon into his treasure-house, leaving him to choose his own reward. Shimon found there the vexatious decree, which he took away and tore into pieces. This legend, the origin of which is non-Jewish, has been discussed by modern scholars. Israel Lévi thinks it is a variation of the legend of the apostle Bartholomew exorcising a demon that had taken possession of the daughter of Polymnius, the King of India. Israel Lévi&#x27;s opinion was approved by Joseph Halévy. Bacher thinks there is another Christian legend which corresponds more closely to the Talmudic narrative: that in which Abercius exorcised a demon from Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus Aurelius.

Shimon is stated to have said that whatever might be the number of persons deserving to enter heaven, he and his son were certainly of that number, so that if there were only two, these were himself and his son. He is also credited with saying that, united with his son and Jotham, King of Judah, he would be able to absolve the world from judgment. Thus, on account of his exceptional piety and continual study of the Law, Shimon was considered as one of those whose merit preserves the world, and therefore during his life the rainbow was never seen, that promise of God&#x27;s forbearance not being needed.

==Teachings==

The fullest account of Shimon&#x27;s teachings is to be found in W. Bacher&#x27;s &quot;Agada der Tannaiten&quot;. When the Talmud attributes a teaching to Shimon without specifying which Shimon is meant, it means Shimon bar Yochai.

===Halacha===
Shimon&#x27;s halakhot are very numerous; they appear in every tractate of the Talmud except Berakhot, Hallah, Ta&#x27;anit, Nedarim, Tamid, and Middot. He greatly valued the teaching of his master Akiva, and he is reported to have recommended his pupils to follow his own system of interpretation (&quot;middot&quot;) because it was derived from that of Akiva. But this itself shows that Shimon did not follow his teacher in every point; indeed, as is shown below, he often differed from Akiva, declaring his own interpretations to be the better. He was independent in his halakhic decisions, and did not refrain from criticizing the tannaim of the preceding generations. He and Jose ben Halafta were generally of the same opinion; but sometimes Shimon sided with Meir. Like the other pupils of Akiva, who, wishing to perpetuate the latter&#x27;s teaching, systematized it in the foundation of the Mishnah (Meir), Tosefta (Nehemiah), and Sifra (Judah), Shimon is credited with the authorship of the Sifre (a halakhic midrash to Numbers and Deuteronomy) and of the Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon (a similar midrash to Exodus).

The particular characteristic of Shimon&#x27;s teaching was that whether in a halakhah or in a aggadic interpretation of a Biblical command, he endeavored to find the underlying reason for it. This often resulted in a material modification of the command in question. From many instances the following may be taken: In the prohibition against taking a widow&#x27;s garment in pledge, it was Judah ben Ilai&#x27;s opinion that no difference is to be made between a rich and a poor widow. But Shimon gives the reason for such a prohibition, which was that if such a pledge were taken it would be necessary to return it every evening, and going to the widow&#x27;s home every morning and evening might compromise her reputation. Consequently, he declares, the prohibition applies only in the case of a poor widow, since one who is rich would not need to have the garment returned in the evening.

Shimon&#x27;s name was widely identified with this halakhic principle of interpretation, and his teacher Akiva approved of it; therefore his contemporaries often applied to him when they wished to know the reason for certain halakhot. Shimon also divided the oral law into numbered groups, of which 15 are preserved in the Talmud. He especially favored the system of giving general rules, of which there are a great number. All this shows that he was systematic, and that he had the power of expressing himself clearly. He was dogmatic in his halakhic decisions, but where there was a doubt as to which of two courses should be followed, and the Rabbis adopted a compromise, he admitted the legality of either course. He differed from Akiva in that he did not think that particles like &quot;et,&quot; &quot;gam,&quot; and others contain in themselves indications of halakhot; but in many instances he showed that he was opposed to Ishmael&#x27;s opinion that the Torah speaks as men do and that seemingly pleonastic words can never serve as the basis for deducing new laws.

===Aggadah===
Shimon is very prominent also in aggadah, and his utterances are numerous in both Talmuds. Many of his sayings bear on Torah study, which he believed should be the main object of man&#x27;s life. Despite the stress he laid on the importance of prayer, and particularly on the reading of the &quot;Shema&#x27;,&quot; he declared that one must not, for the sake of either, interrupt the study of the Torah. He considers the Torah one of the three good gifts which God gave to Israel and which can not be preserved without suffering. But recognizing the difficulty of occupying oneself with Torah study and of providing a livelihood at the same time, Shimon said that the Torah was given only for those who ate the manna or the priestly meals. He declared that had he been on Mount Sinai when God delivered the Torah to Israel, he would have requested two mouths for man, one to be used exclusively as a means for repeating and thus learning the Torah. But then he added, &quot;How great also would be the evil done by delators [&quot;moserim&quot;] with two mouths!&quot;

Among Shimon&#x27;s many other utterances may be mentioned those with regard to repentance, and some of his ethical sayings. &quot;So great is the power of repentance that a man who has been during his lifetime very wicked [], if he repent toward the end, is considered a perfectly righteous man&quot;. He was particularly severe against haughtiness, which, he declared, is like idolatry, and against publicly shaming one&#x27;s neighbor: &quot;One should rather throw himself into a burning furnace than shame a neighbor in public&quot;. He denounced the crimes of usury, deceitful dealing, and disturbing domestic peace.

His animosity toward the Gentiles generally and toward feminine superstition is expressed in the following utterance: &quot;The best of the heathen merits death; the best of serpents should have its head crushed; and the most pious of women is prone to sorcery.&quot; Although often quoted by antisemites, his comment was uttered after witnessing his teacher being tortured to death, bar Yochai himself becoming a fugitive after speaking out against Roman oppression. His hostility to the Romans is expressed also in his maxims; thus, alluding probably to the Parthian war which broke out in the time of Antoninus Pius, he said: &quot;If you see a Persian horse tied to [the graves of]Israel, look for the steps of the Messiah&quot;.

===Mysticism===
Shimon combined with his rationalism in halakhah a mysticism in his aggadic teachings, as well as in his practice. He spoke of a magic sword, on which the Name was inscribed, being given by God to Moses on Sinai; and he ascribed all kinds of miraculous powers to Moses. After his death he appeared to the saints in their visions.

Thus his name became connected with mystic lore, and he became a chief authority for the kabbalists. There exist two apocryphal midrashim ascribed to Shimon: &quot;The Secrets of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai&quot; and &quot;Tefillat R. Shim&#x27;on b. Yoḥai&quot;. Both of them bear on the Messianic time, but the second is more complete. The main point of these midrashim is that while Shimon was hidden in the cavern, he fasted forty days and prayed to God to rescue Israel from such persecutions. Then Metatron revealed to him the future, announcing the various Muslim rulers, the last one of whom would perish at the hands of the Messiah. As in similar messianic apocrypha, the chief characters are Armilus and the three Messiahs: Messiah b. Joseph (Ephraim), Messiah b. Aaron, and Messiah b. David (as evidenced in Dead Sea scrolls).

While he was originally attributed authorship of the Zohar, this claim is universally rejected by modern scholars, who point to Moses de León as the primary author.

== Commemoration ==
Some believe that bar Yochai died on the 33rd day of the Omer, known as Lag BaOmer, due to a printing error in Hayyim Vital&#x27;s &quot;Pri Etz Chadash&quot;. Some believe that on the day of his death, he revealed deep kabbalistic secrets which formed the basis of the Zohar. According to the &quot;Bnei Yissaschar&quot;, on the day of his death, bar Yochai said, &quot;Now it is my desire to reveal secrets... The day will not go to its place like any other, for this entire day stands within my domain...&quot; Daylight was miraculously extended until he had completed his final teaching and died.

His yahrzeit is widely known as a &quot;Yom Hillula&quot;, a day of celebration. This is based on the original text of &quot;Shaar HaKavanot&quot; by Chaim Vital, which refers to the day as &quot;Yom Simchato&quot; (&quot;the day of his happiness&quot;), rather than &quot;Yom SheMet&quot; (&quot;the day that he died&quot;). There is thus a very widely observed custom to celebrate on Lag BaOmer at his burial place in Meron. With bonfires, torches, song and feasting, the&quot;Yom Hillula&quot; is celebrated by hundreds of thousands of people. Some say that the bonfires are lit to symbolize the impact of his teachings.

===Commemoration customs at the tomb===
Customs at the tomb include the lighting of a bonfire that traditionally goes to the Rebbes of the Boyaner dynasty Boys at the age of three will often come to the tomb to receive their first haircut. Another custom at the tomb of Shimon bar Yochai is the giving of &quot;Ḥai Rotel&quot; (). The Hebrew letters chet and yod are the gematria (numerical equivalent) of 18. &quot;Rotel&quot; is a liquid measure of about 3 litres. Thus, 18 rotels equals 54 litres or about 13 gallons. It is popularly believed that if one donates or offers 18 rotels of liquid refreshment (grape juice, wine, soda or even water) to those attending the celebrations at bar Yochai&#x27;s tomb on Lag BaOmer, then the giver will be granted miraculous salvation.

<text>Ichthyothere is a genus of flowering plants, found in parts of South America (the Amazon) and Central America.

The name &quot;ichthyothere&quot; literally translates as &quot;fish poison&quot;. These plants&#x27; active constituent is a chemical called ichthyothereol, which is a polyyne compound that is highly toxic to fish and mammals. &quot;Ichthyothere terminalis&quot; leaves have traditionally been used to make poisoned bait by indigenous peoples of the lower Amazon basin.

This genus is characterized by the small capitulum with few (usually one or two) fertile ray florets.
It lacks an expanded outer series of herbaceous involucral bracts or phyllaries. These tend to be much reduced.

&quot;Ichthyothere scandens&quot; and &quot;Ichthyothere garcia-barrigae&quot;, both found at elevations above 1,000m, belong to a unique subgenus within &quot;Ichthyothere&quot;. The other species are small herbs with an erect stem, showing tightly clustered or glomerulate groups of capitula. They occur below 1,000 m elevation.

Its taxonomic status has been revised several times. It was classified in the subtribes Melampodiinae, Milleriinae and then in a group of unclassified taxa. Recent molecular phylogenetic research has now placed the genus &quot;Ichthyothere&quot; in the subtribe Espeletiinae. It may be a sister taxon to the &quot;Espeletia&quot; complex.

<text>Bob Flanagan (December 26, 1952 – January 4, 1996) was an American performance artist and writer known for his work on sadomasochism and living with cystic fibrosis.

==Early life==

Flanagan was born in New York City on December 26, 1952, and grew up in Costa Mesa, California, with his mother, Kathy; father, Robert; brothers John and Tim; and sister, Patricia. In childhood, Flanagan was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. His sister, Patricia, died at age 21 of the same illness, which also claimed the life of his second sister, who died soon after birth. At age 14, in 1967, Flanagan was named the first poster child for the North Orange County chapter of the National Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation.

Flanagan graduated from Costa Mesa High School, and studied literature at California State University, Long Beach and the University of California, Irvine. He moved to Los Angeles in 1976.

==Career==
Flanagan began reading his poems around Southern California in the mid-1970s, and was part of the poetry community at Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center. He published his first book, &quot;The Kid is the Man&quot;, with Bombshelter Press in 1978.

Flanagan met Sheree Rose in 1980, and collaborated closely with her for the rest of his life. Through the 1980s, Flanagan and Rose focused on BDSM community education and organizing, and were founding members of the Los Angeles chapter of the Society of Janus. Their work in performance art began with the 1989 piece &quot;Nailed&quot;, presented in conjunction with the release of the RE/Search publication &quot;Modern Primitives&quot;. In &quot;Nailed&quot;, Flanagan nailed his penis and scrotum to a board while singing &quot;If I Had a Hammer.&quot;

&quot;Visiting Hours&quot;, first shown at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in 1992, combined text, video, and live performance, and explored the convergence of illness and SM. It was Flanagan&#x27;s most widely toured museum exhibition. In the center of the gallery, Flanagan lay in a hospital bed and interacted with museum visitors for the duration of the exhibit. According to curator Laura Trippi, &quot;The installation is designed like a crazy stage set of a children&#x27;s residential hospital, replete with a torture chamber lurking amidst the institutional cheer.&quot;

In 1996, Flanagan received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International.

==Music videos==
Flanagan is featured in the widely banned music video for the song &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; by Nine Inch Nails. In the video, a nude Flanagan is bound to a mechanical torture device which pierces his flesh, pulls on his nipples and penis with pincers, crushes his genitals with a paddle, and ultimately kills him. Apart from his onscreen &quot;death&quot;, all of the acts inflicted on Flanagan in the video are unsimulated.

In 1993, Flanagan appeared in the video for the Danzig song &quot;It&#x27;s Coming Down&quot;. In the uncensored version of the video (near the ending), Flanagan pierces his upper and lower lips together and then he hammers a nail through the head of his penis before bleeding on the lens of the camera recording him.

Flanagan also had a small role in Godflesh&#x27;s &quot;Crush My Soul&quot; video, as an upside-down suspended Christ, hoisted on to the ceiling of a church by Sheree Rose.

==Death==
On January 4, 1996, Flanagan died from complications due to cystic fibrosis at 43. He was survived by his wife and close artistic collaborator Sheree Rose. His body now lies in the chapel of Forest Lawn Cemetery.

The final years of Flanagan&#x27;s life, including his death, are the subject of the Kirby Dick documentary &quot;&quot;. Flanagan&#x27;s participation in the film was contingent upon his death being part of the completed project.

<text>Myrtos is a coastal village and a community in the west of the municipality of Ierapetra, in the Regional Unit (previously called prefecture) of Lasithi on the Greek island of Crete. It is located from Agios Nikolaos and from Ierapetra, on the road to Viannos. A little to the west of the village is the iconic conical Kolektos mountain. Myrtos is situated on the Libyan Sea. The patron saint of the village is Saint Anthony.
The population of the community is 518 (2021).

The transliteral spelling of this village is often written as Mirtos.

Myrtos has a rich history but has only prospered with the advent of tourism. The village has many tavernas and diverse shops for both residents and visitors. More recently there is now a pharmacy and an ATM. There are numerous churches, hotels, apartments and studios.

There is a regular bus service between Ierapetra and Myrtos.

==History==

The area surrounding Myrtos was already inhabited during the Minoan period, but the current village dates from the first half of the twentieth century. Before that, it was the location of a small port, where inhabitants from the higher surrounding areas traded local products that they shipped to Ierápetra. Only when threats from piracy along the Cretan coast diminished and it became safer to live there, did the village of Myrtos develop.

On September 15, 1944, during the Second World War, the inhabitants of Myrtos were ordered by the Nazi-German occupiers to leave the village. Many refused to do so, resulting in the massacre of eighteen inhabitants as a reprisal and the almost complete destruction of the village by fire. There is a monument to commemorate that event which has now been relocated to the periphery of Myrtos adjacent to the Heraklion/Ierapetra highway. Every year on October 28, Ohi Day is commemorated near this monument.

Tourism started at the beginning of the 1970s. Initially, Myrtos was especially popular amongst hippies, but later also &#x27;regular&#x27; tourists started to visit the village. Since the 1980s, apartment complexes have been built in Myrtos, but tourism in Myrtos is still relatively small-scale and nowhere near as developed as the tourist centres which are found on the North coast of Crete.

==Climate==
Myrtos has a subtropical climate. The temperature in Myrtos (as well as in some other areas of southern Crete) is a few degrees higher than in the north, because the northern winds are blocked by the Dikti mountain range (whose highest point is ).

The average temperature in the warmest months of the year (July and August) is around 28 °C (82 °F), though sometimes it can exceed 40 °C (105 °F). The temperature during the coldest months of the year (January and February) averages about 13-14 °C (55 °F) but on rare occasions it can also snow in Myrtos.

==The beaches==
Myrtos has a long beach consisting not just of sand, but also of fine-grained pebbles. The beach has received the &quot;Blue Flag award&quot;, which requires the beach to satisfy a number of criteria in order to retain it. The nearby village of Tertsa also has a very long beach. On the two outlying beaches of Tertsa, nudism is tolerated by the authorities.

==Points of interest==
Myrtos is also the location for two Minoan archaeological sites, at Fournou Korifi and Pyrgos, which provide evidence that the village and its environs have been inhabited since the neolithic period. There is also a Roman villa, although the ruins are now largely covered or lost due to coastal erosion and local building.

In Myrtos there is a small museum, dedicated to the local history, which features a scale model of Fournou Korifi created by John Atkinson, a British potter resident in the village who is the current museum curator. Near the small village Mithi, about 3 miles (5 km) from Myrtos lies the Sarakina Gorge.

==Economy==

Of particular importance in increasing the prosperity around Myrtos in the middle of the twentieth century was the Netherlander Paul Kuijpers. After his studies in the Netherlands, he moved to Crete in 1966 and introduced greenhouses in the southern part of the island, as a result of which farmers could harvest all year round and were less dependent on the weather. The areas surrounding Myrtos are still dominated by greenhouses often composed only of wooden frames covered with plastic sheeting. In 1971, Kuijpers was killed in a car accident and a memorial bust in Gra Lighia commemorates his importance for the area.

<doc id="314274" wikidata="Q545599" url="?curid=314274" title="Haunted house">
<text>A haunted house, spook house or ghost house in ghostlore is a house or other building often perceived as being inhabited by disembodied spirits of the deceased who may have been former residents or were otherwise connected with the property. Parapsychologists often attribute haunting to the spirits of the dead who have suffered from violent or tragic events in the building&#x27;s past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide.

Upon scientific investigation, alternative causes to supernatural phenomenon are found, such as hoaxes, environmental effects, hallucinations or confirmation biases. Common symptoms of hauntings, like cold spots and creaking or knocking sounds, can be found in most homes regardless of suspected paranormal presences. Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been cited as a cause of suspected hauntings.

==History==
According to Owen Davies, a paranormal historian, hauntings in the British Isles were usually attributed to fairies, but today hauntings are usually associated with ghostly or supernatural encounters. In other cultures around the world, various spirits are said to haunt vacant homes and locations. In Middle Eastern countries, for example, jinn are said to haunt such areas. Historically, since most people died in their homes, whether they were mansions or hovels, these homes allegedly became natural places for ghosts to haunt, with bedrooms being the most common rooms to be haunted. Many houses gained a reputation for being haunted after they were empty or derelict. Davies explains that &quot;if people were to fail to occupy a human space, then external forces would move in.&quot;

==Cultural attitudes to haunted houses==
Haunting is one of the most common paranormal beliefs around the world, according to Benjamin Radford in his book &quot;Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits&quot;. He says that almost every town and city has at least one &quot;haunted&quot; place; and that, despite over 100 years of investigation, there has not been a &quot;single verifiable fact about ghosts having been established.&quot;

In the first century A.D., the Roman author and statesman Pliny the Younger recorded a ghost story in his letters, which became famous for their vivid account of life during the heyday of the Roman Empire. Pliny reported that the specter of an old man with a long beard, and rattling chains, was haunting his house in Athens. The Greek writer Lucian and Pliny&#x27;s fellow Roman Plautus also wrote memorable ghost stories.

In a 2005 Gallup poll, 37% of Americans, 28% of Canadians, and 40% of Britons believed that houses could be haunted. In a 2009 Pew Research Center survey, about 29% of Americans believed they had been in touch with someone who had died. According to a Research Co. poll released in 2020, 40% of Canadian women and 25% of Canadian men stated they believed in haunted houses.

In Japan, there is a tradition, linked to Buddhism, of creating (ghost houses) in August, when it is believed that ancestral spirits may visit. People go to ghost houses to listen to frightening stories or seek elaborate decorations and costumes to experience shivers as a way to feel cooler in the hot summer temperatures.

The Shanghai Disneyland Park planners decided against building The Haunted Mansion because of the local cultural beliefs about ghosts and hauntings. Building the house would have been considered a mockery of their fear.

In Wuhan, China, the police have built a haunted house to train their police force by testing their nerves. They filled a dilapidated house with faked severed limbs, bones, skulls and a frightening atmosphere that includes lightning and rain. The house is also open to the public.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, Indonesian lawmakers of the Sragen region on the island of Java decided to lock people who did not follow quarantine guidelines in abandoned and supposedly haunted houses. It was an attempt to motivate a superstitious population when science failed to do so.

==Proposed causes==
According to Owen Davies&#x27;s book, &quot;The Haunted: a Social History of Ghosts&quot;, &quot;[e]ven the most devout believers in ghosts over the centuries recognized that many hauntings were frauds.&quot; In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Davies states that &quot;[f]or skeptics in the past and present, the house was obviously the center of hauntings because it was where people slept and dreamed of the dead, or where people lay drunk, drugged or hallucinating in their sickbeds.&quot; Such basic poltergeist phenomena as rapping or knocking were very easy to orchestrate with the help of accomplices or a variety of ploys. According to science writer Terence Hines, cold spots, creaking sounds, and odd noises are typically present in any home, especially older ones, and &quot;such noises can easily be mistaken for the sound of footsteps by those inclined to imagine the presence of a deceased tenant in their home.&quot;

A sensed-presence effect, the feeling that there is someone else present in a room, is known to happen when people experience monotony, darkness, cold, hunger, fatigue, fear, and sleep deprivation.

Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell writes that in most cases he investigated, he found plausible explanations for haunting phenomena, such as physical illusions, waking dreams, and the effects of memory. According to Nickell, the power of suggestion along with confirmation bias plays a large role in perceived hauntings. He states that as a house, inn, or other place becomes thought of as haunted, more and more ghostly encounters are reported and that when people expect paranormal events, they tend to notice conditions that would confirm their expectations. Many places deemed to be haunted are purposefully left in a decrepit condition, with wall paper peeling off, old carpeting, and antique decor.

Toxicologist Albert Donnay believes that chronic exposure to substances such as carbon monoxide, pesticide, and formaldehyde can lead to hallucinations of the type associated with haunted houses. Donnay speculates on the connection between the prevalence of gas lamps, during the Victorian era and start of the twentieth century, as well as stories of ghost sightings and hauntings, describing it as the &quot;Haunted House Syndrome&quot;. Donnay says that carbon monoxide poisoning has been linked to haunted houses since at least the 1920s. He cites a 1921 journal article about a family who claimed hauntings because they suffered headaches, auditory hallucinations, fatigue, melancholy, and other symptoms which are also associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. In a modern example, Carrie Poppy, a writer and co-host of the podcast &quot;Oh No, Ross and Carrie!&quot;, was convinced she was living in a haunted house. She felt she was being watched by a demon, experienced pressure on her chest and auditory hallucinations. Someone on a forum of skeptical paranormal investigators suggested she look into carbon monoxide poisoning. When the gas company arrived, unsafe levels of carbon monoxide were found.

Michael Persinger, an American-Canadian professor of psychology, suggested that perceived apparitions, cold spots, and ghostly touches are perceptual anomalies caused by variations in naturally occurring or man-made magnetic fields. However, a study by psychologist Chris French that attempted to replicate Persinger&#x27;s findings found no link.

==Investigating haunted phenomena==
Investigations of supposed hauntings often result in simple explanations. For example, in an apparent haunted house in Somerset, England, in the eighteenth century, a boy would make the house shake by jumping on a beam in an adjoining property that ran through both houses. In 1857, a twelve-year-old girl confessed to tying her long hair around objects to give them the ghostly appearance of moving on their own. Tina Resch, a girl from Columbus, Ohio, who claimed that ghostly and paranormal activity occurred in her home, was photographed throwing a telephone while acting surprised at the sudden poltergeist activity.

Ben Radford, of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, performed an investigation in 2003 on an allegedly haunted house in Buffalo, New York. The owner of the home, called Tom in the article (pseudonym), alleged that he felt tapping on his foot at night. As described by Tom, &quot;I get a tapping on my feet, not a repetitive tap, a trying-to-wake-you-up tap… After the tapping, if I don&#x27;t pay attention to it, then I feel a kick.&quot; Radford suggests the tapping was likely a case of &quot;hypnagogic hallucination (a sensory illusion that occurs in the transition to sleep), a fairly common phenomenon that can easily lead to misperceptions.&quot; His wife, called Monica (pseudonym), also claimed to feel tapping similar to Tom. According to Radford, &quot;that can be explained by suggestion and what psychologists term Folie à deux, when one person (often a spouse) takes on the symptoms of another.&quot; Tom also describes that &quot;it will kick the bed—it will hit the side of the bed. I feel my whole body move… Then if I go back to sleep, I start to get a sound sleep, that&#x27;s when it kicks again.&quot; Radford suggests his was likely due to restless leg syndrome in which a leg jerk in the middle of the night caused the bed to shake. Radford suggests that the owner&#x27;s diagnosis of &quot;sleep apnea is even further evidence for this explanation; restless legs (Restless Leg Syndrome) is actually one of the most common symptoms of apnea.&quot; Tom and Monica also heard ghostly music and voices, noises that they recorded from the top of the stairs, causing them to leave their home in fright. Radford conducted an experiment where he set the recording device in the same spot, turned it on, then walked outside with Tom, talking constantly. They returned to the house and listened to the tape. Their conversations could be clearly heard, though muffled. The couple then agreed that what they were hearing in their house previously were outside noises and not noises from the paranormal.

Another test done by Ben Radford in 2009 was to investigate the claim that batteries are drained by ghosts in haunted locations. He purchased four sets of identical batteries, sealed them in signed, Ziploc bags and wrapped them securely in strong tape to prevent tampering. He placed half of them in the reputed haunted Wolfe Manor, in Clovis, California, and half in a different location. Twenty four hours later he tested the batteries using a meter and discovered that there was no battery drainage in either location. Radford claims that simple, controlled experiments like this are important and should be conducted by ghost hunters to clearly demonstrate if there is a difference between a supposed haunted location and one that is not haunted.

==Famous haunted houses==

A house in Amityville, on Long Island, New York, became the subject of books and films after apparent hauntings following the murder of the DeFeo family. The Lutz family purchased the home for a greatly reduced price but shortly after moving in claimed that doors were ripped open, damaging hinges and bending locks, windows were suddenly opened, green slime oozed from the ceiling and cloven-hooved footprints were left in the snow. The Lutzes remained in the home for only 28 days. In a court case where the Lutzes were sued, they admitted that almost everything in the 1977 book &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; was fictional.

Borley Rectory, in England, was considered the most haunted house in the world, but its notoriety was deemed to have been created (or at least exaggerated) by Harry Price, an expert magician and proven hoaxer. 

Corvin Castle in Romania is considered one of the world&#x27;s top five haunted places. According to locals, it has been haunted by its former occupant, Vlad the Impaler, ever since he was killed in an ambush. It is also said to be haunted by the spirits of people killed within its walls.

Casa Loma in Toronto, Canada, was completed in 1914. There have been rumors of ghosts there for many years. It is now a historic house museum and landmark that is decorated as a haunted house at Halloween.

The Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California is considered one of the most haunted houses in America, although there are no primary sources for the many ghost stories about it. They were most likely inspired by Sarah Winchester, who had her strange, complex, often illogical designs incorporated into the house for almost four decades.

Wukang Mansion, a historical house in Shanghai, has a reputation for being haunted because of the large number of suicides of celebrities, intellectuals, and state-persecuted people there.

Government House and Phitsanulok Mansion in Bangkok. Two nearby government buildings, these two Neo-Gothic style buildings have a history dating back to the reign of King Rama VI (early 20th century). They were all buildings given by the king to his two favorite pages who were brothers. During World War II, they became government property along with being occupied by the Japanese army. There are rumors that they are haunted, especially Phitsanulok Mansion which is known as &quot;Thailand&#x27;s White House&quot;.
==Halloween-themed haunted houses==
Halloween themed &quot;haunted houses&quot; began appearing around the same time as &quot;trick or treat&quot;, during the Great Depression, as a way to distract young people whose Halloween pranks had escalated to vandalism and harassment of passersby. These first exhibits were low quality, being put together by groups of families in their basements. People would travel from home to home to experience a variety of frightening situations, such as hearing weird moans and howls, cardboard cutouts of black cats, damp sponges and hair nets hanging from the ceiling to touch people&#x27;s faces, hanging fur on the walls of darkened hallways, and having to crawl through long dark tunnels.

In 1972 Jerry Falwell and Liberty University introduced one of the first &quot;hell houses&quot; as an anti-Halloween attraction. Some Christian churches run these, which while being haunted houses, also promote their interpretation of the Christian gospel message. According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, in hell houses, &quot;participants walk through several &#x27;scenes&#x27; depicting the consequences of things like abortion, homosexuality and drunkenness.&quot;

==Commercial haunted houses==

The concept of the haunted house was capitalized on as early as 1915 with the Orton and Spooner Haunted House in the Hollycombe Steam Collection (England). The haunted house became a cultural icon when Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion was opened in 1969. By the 1970s, commercial haunted houses had sprung up all over the United States in cities like Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio. These houses are stereotypically Gilded Age homes because changing tastes of the nouveau riche left these homes abandoned or poorly maintained.

Hollywood slasher films such as &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; had a large influence on commercial haunted houses in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of these houses included characters such as Freddy Krueger and Jason. A less popular film titled &quot;Monster House&quot; suggests the idea of a spirit actually taking control of a house and transforming it into an almost human body. By 2005, an estimated 3,500 to 5,000 professional haunted attractions operated in the United States.

Japanese commercial haunted houses, or obakeyashiki, are considered to be some of the best in the world. Experiences include being chased by gore-covered zombies, specially themed attractions, such as schools or hospital wards, and houses from which one must escape within 60 minutes or be found by &quot;slaughtering criminals&quot;. Claiming to be the world&#x27;s largest and most frightening haunted house, the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear at Fuji-Q Highland Amusement Park, in Yamanashi Fujiyoshida-shi Shinnishihara, depicts horrific visual scenes, shrill cries, moans, and smells. It has been visited by over four million people.

Haunted Attractions come in several different types from hayrides, indoor haunted houses to outdoor screamparks. Many amusement parks now host large Halloween events featuring haunted houses.

==Selling haunted houses==
In the case &quot;Stambovsky v. Ackley&quot;, the Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, ruled in 1991 that a seller must disclose that a house has a reputation for being haunted because such a reputation may impair the value of the house:
In Hong Kong, where superstition is prevalent, people do not want to buy houses where anything unfortunate, especially a death, has occurred. For homes that are thought to be haunted, the prices are usually 15–20% below market value.

==Short stories and novels==
Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in the literature. The earliest surviving report of a haunted house comes from a letter written by Pliny the Younger (61 – c. 112 CE) to his patron Lucias Sura, in which he describes a haunted villa in Athens. Nobody would live in the house until the philosopher Athenodorus (c. 74 BCE – 7 CE) arrived in the city. He was tempted by the low rent and undeterred by the house&#x27;s reputation so he moved in. The ghost, an old man bound with chains, appeared to Athenodorus during the first night and beckoned to him. The apparition vanished once it reached the courtyard, and Athenodorus carefully marked the spot. The following morning he requested the magistrate to have the spot dug up, where the skeleton of an old man bound with chains was discovered. The ghost never appeared again after the skeleton was given a proper burial.

Stories of haunted houses appear in the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, as in the tale of &quot;Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad&quot;. The first gothic novel, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764) by Horace Walpole, is set in a haunted castle, as is &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;, a humorous short story from 1887 by Oscar Wilde. 

One of the most prominent twentieth-century books of the genre is the classic &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; by Shirley Jackson, a finalist for the National Book Award in 1959. Other notable works of fiction featuring haunted houses include &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; (1897) by Henry James, &quot;Hell House&quot; (1971) by Richard Matheson, &quot;The Shining&quot; (1977) by Stephen King, and &quot;The House Next Door&quot; (1978) by Anne Rivers Siddons.

<doc id="314276" wikidata="Q2010377" url="?curid=314276" title="Myrtos Pyrgos">
<text>Pyrgos (also Myrtos-Pyrgos; ) is an archaeological site of the Minoan civilization near Myrtos in the municipality of Ierapetra on the south coast of Crete. Pyrgos provides evidence of settlements along the southern Ierapetra Isthmus. This site has had a long history due to its valuable location and geography. It is located close to the Myrtos valley and has a harbor with a  nearby mountain range providing its protection. The settlement includes a courtyard, many rooms, a country house and a tomb.

== History ==

In 1970 the site began to be excavated by archaeologist Gerald Cadogan. It is near another Myrtos settlement called Fournou Korifi. This settlement lasted from the early Minoan period, middle Minoan period, and the Neopalatial period. The early Minoan Period lasted from 3560 BCE to 2160 BCE. The middle Minoan period includes the old and new palace period which lasted from 2160 BCE to 1600 BCE. The late Minoan period lasted from 1600 BCE to 1170 BCE.

This site was established approximately 3000 BCE with Fourno Korifi being established around the same time. They were both destroyed in a fire around 2150 BCE. Its estimated Pyrgos was resettled in 1900 BCE.  From then on Pyrgos served as an administrative center and established new structures.

==Archaeology==

This Minoan settlement on the road to Ierapetra boasts several Minoan features: a drain, paved floors and footpaths and ashlar foundation blocks for its central building. Although historians may debate whether certain Minoan sites were actually administrative or exchange sites, it is widely agreed Myrtos-Pyrgos was an administrative site. Myrtos Pyrgos is used as an example of what an administrative site during the Minoan civilization looks like. Unlike other settlements, Myrtos-Pyrgos named rulers found in iconography with proof of control of exchanges and items produced. This site is also known for its central tomb and country house.

=== Myrtos Pyrgos Country House ===

The country house was built in the Late Minoan Period and was built atop of a hill. Historians theorize the house was built to overlook all of the agriculture and be a building that rules the site. The building had in total 9 rooms. Three of the rooms are thought to be basements for the rooms above. The house is also thought to be three stories tall. Another three of the rooms are thought to be entrances meanwhile the other rooms may have been store rooms. In the artifacts historians found, there is evidence that suggests a shrine being located in the house.

=== Myrtos Pyrgos Tomb ===

Inside the tomb, archaeologists found clay vases and cups. This suggests rituals were a practice used by the Minoans. In addition, knives, daggers, and triton shells were also found. The corpses found were thought to be all part of a certain social group as they were all male. The remains are a bit disfigured in their structure. One man has an extra long bone and a young man&#x27;s skeleton was given the skull of an older man. It is unknown for what specific reason the dead were arranged in this way. While other depositions of men, women, and children were outside of the tomb, it is thought the Myrtos Pyrgos tomb was constructed for powerful figures.

Some archaeologists suggest the Minoans had an idea of a religion due to the placement of the tomb. The tomb is placed on the edge of the settlement but it is still within the settlement. This suggests the Minoans saw tombs as a gateway to the afterlife. In addition, unlike other tombs that have been found at other sites, the Myrtos Pyrgos tomb is monumental and public. This reinforces the idea of the dead in the tomb being of some significance or purpose.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-35 (-35; NATO reporting name: Flanker-E/M, occasionally nicknamed &quot;Super Flanker&quot;) is the designation for two improved derivatives of the Su-27 air-defence fighter. They are single-seat, twin-engine, supermaneuverable, 4.5 generation air superiority fighters, designed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau and built by Sukhoi.

The type was originally developed by the Soviet Union from the Su-27 and was known as the Su-27M. It incorporated canards and a multi-function radar giving it multi-role capabilities. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union Sukhoi re-designated it as the Su-35 to attract export orders. Fourteen aircraft were produced and used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines and was in turn redesignated the Su-37. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that resembled the Su-30MK family.

In 2003, Sukhoi embarked on a second &quot;deep&quot; modernization of the Su-27 to serve as an interim export aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as the Su-35, this version incorporates technology from the PAK FA program and has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the canards. The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although it was designed for export, the Russian Air Force became the launch customer in 2009, with the production version designated Su-35S. China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force has also placed orders.

==Design and development==

===Upgraded Su-27===
The first aircraft design to receive the Su-35 designation had its origins in the early 1980s, at a time when the Su-27 was being introduced into service with the Soviet Armed Forces. The definitive production version of the Su-27, which had the factory code of T-10S, started mass (&quot;serial&quot;) production with the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association (KnAAPO) in 1983. The following year, this Su-27 version reached initial operational readiness with the Soviet Air Defence Forces. Having begun work on an upgraded Su-27 variant in 1982, the Sukhoi Design Bureau was instructed in December 1983 by the Soviet Council of Ministers to use the Su-27 as the basis for the development of the Su-27M (T-10M). Nikolay Nikitin would lead the design effort throughout much of the project&#x27;s existence, under the oversight of General Director Mikhail Simonov, who had been the chief designer of the Su-27 along with Mikhail Pogosyan.
While sharing broadly the blended wing-body design of the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version by the addition of canards, which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the canards, in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-&quot;g&quot; manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 &quot;g&quot; on the Su-27) without additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved the aircraft&#x27;s manoeuvrability and enabled it to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120 degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.

Besides the increase in manoeuvrability, another feature that distinguished the Su-27M from the original design was the new weapons-control system. The centrepiece of this system was the multi-function N011 Bars (literally &quot;Leopard&quot;) phased-array radar with pulse-Doppler tracking that allowed it to detect targets below the horizon. First installed on the third prototype, the radar transformed the Su-27M from simply being an air-defence fighter into a multi-role aircraft capable of attacking ground targets. Compared to the N001 Myech (&quot;Sword&quot;) radar of the Su-27, which could track 10 targets and only direct two missiles towards one target at a time, the new radar could track fifteen targets and direct missiles towards six of them simultaneously. The extra weight of the N011 radar at the front of the aircraft necessitated the addition of the canards; engineers would only later discover the aerodynamic advantages of these devices. In addition, an N012 self-defence radar was housed in the rearward-projecting tail boom, making the aircraft the first in the world to have such a radar. Other changes to the aircraft included the use of uprated turbofan engines, as well as the increased use of lightweight composites and aluminium-lithium alloys in the aircraft&#x27;s structure.

===Testing and demonstration===
In 1987, Sukhoi started converting the first prototype (designated ) from a T-10S airframe at its experimental plant in Moscow. Although it had canards, the first prototype, like several subsequent aircraft, lacked the many physical alterations of the new design. It made its first flight after conversion on 28 June 1988, piloted by Oleg Tsoi, followed by the second prototype in January 1989. Following the conversions of the two Su-27M prototypes, the actual production of the aircraft was transferred to the country&#x27;s Far East where it was carried out by KnAAPO. The third aircraft (), which was the first new-built Su-27M and first to be constructed by KnAAPO, made its first flight in April 1992. By then, the Soviet Union had disintegrated, and the ensuing economic crisis in Russia throughout the 1990s meant that the original plan to mass-produce the aircraft between 1996 and 2005 was abandoned, with the aircraft to serve as experimental test-beds to validate the canards, the flight-control system and thrust-vectoring technology. In total, two prototypes, nine flying pre-production and three production aircraft were constructed by 1995; the production aircraft were delivered in 1996 to the Russian Air Force for weapons testing.
By the time of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Sukhoi had been demonstrating the Su-27M to senior defence and government officials. With its debut to a Western audience at the 1992 Farnborough Airshow, the company redesignated the aircraft as Su-35. The aircraft subsequently made flying demonstrations overseas in an effort to attract export orders, starting in November 1993 with Dubai, where Viktor Pugachev flew it in a mock aerial engagement with an Su-30MK in front of spectators. The aircraft then flew in Berlin and Paris, and would be a regular feature at Moscow&#x27;s MAKS Air Show. The Russian government cleared the aircraft for export during Sukhoi&#x27;s unsuccessful sales campaign in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s; the company also marketed the aircraft to Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.

As the flight-test programme of the Su-27M proceeded, engineers discovered that the pilot failed to maintain active control of the aircraft during certain manoeuvres, such as the Pugachev&#x27;s Cobra. The eleventh Su-27M () was therefore equipped with thrust-vectoring engine nozzles in 1995, and the resultant Su-37 technology demonstrator made its first flight on 2 April 1996. It also tested the enhanced N011M radar, as did the twelfth developmental Su-27M. The Su-37&#x27;s ability to maintain a high angle of attack while flying at close to zero airspeed attracted considerable press attention. It later received different engines and updated fly-by-wire controls and cockpit systems for evaluation.

Apart from the single-seat design, a two-seat aircraft was also constructed. Working in cooperation with Sukhoi, KnAAPO&#x27;s own engineers designed the Su-35UB so as to combine thrust-vectoring engines with features of the Su-27M. Modified from an Su-30MKK airframe, the aircraft made its first flight on 7 August 2000, and afterwards served as an avionics test-bed. While the original Su-27M never entered mass production due to a lack of funding, Sukhoi refined the Su-27M&#x27;s use of canards and the Su-37&#x27;s thrust-vectoring technology and later applied them to the Su-30MKI two-seat fighter for the Indian Air Force. The tenth Su-27M (T10M-10) also served as a test-bed for the Saturn AL-41F1 engine that is intended for the Sukhoi Su-57 (previously known under the acronym &quot;PAK FA&quot;) jet fighter.

===Modernization===
With the need to update Russia&#x27;s aging fleet of Su-27 aircraft, Sukhoi and KnAAPO in 2002 started integrating glass cockpits and improved weapons-control systems (to accommodate a greater variety of weapons) to existing air force aircraft. The Su-27SM, as the modified aircraft is called, made its first flight in December 2002. The initial success of this project led Sukhoi in December 2003 to proceed with a follow-up &quot;deep&quot; modernization programme. Known internally as T-10BM, the programme was aimed at a more thorough redesign of the airframe to narrow the qualitative gap between Russian aircraft and foreign fourth-generation aircraft. The resultant design, also designated Su-35, would serve as an interim solution pending the introduction of the PAK FA fifth-generation fighter (which eventually became the Su-57), many features of which the aircraft would incorporate. Initially, the aircraft was primarily aimed at the export market, being offered by KnAAPO as a single-seat alternative to the two-seat Su-30MK variants built by Irkutsk Aviation Plant (IAP).

In many respects, the T-10BM design outwardly resembles the Su-27 more than the Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M&#x27;s aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded that the loss of manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards – the addition of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe – could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars has also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifts the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Accordingly we saw SW, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.
While the Su-27M design had the avionics to give the aircraft the nominal designation as a multi-role fighter, flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in deploying the aircraft&#x27;s armament efficiently. According to &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot;, air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a &quot;negative experience&quot;, with a particular emphasis on the layout of the cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the single pilot. Designers, test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the human-machine interface. The information management system of aircraft&#x27;s avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight- and weapons-control systems. The information is then displayed on two multi-function liquid crystal displays, which replaced the smaller multi-function cathode-ray tube displays found on the Su-27M. The pilot can also view critical flight information on the head-up display, and is equipped with Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) controls.

The Su-35 employs the N035 Irbis-E (&quot;Snow Leopard&quot;) passive electronically scanned array (PESA) radar, which is a further development of the N011M radar that had been evaluated on Su-27M test-beds and constitutes the core of the Su-35&#x27;s weapons-control system. It is capable of detecting an aerial target up to away, and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously; in addition, the multi-function radar is capable of providing high-resolution images of the ground using synthetic aperture mode. The aircraft is equipped with an OLS-35 optoelectronic targeting system ahead of the cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra-red search and track. For defences against enemy tracking, the Su-35 is equipped with the L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasure system, while engineers have applied radar-absorbent materials to the engine inlets and front stages of the engine compressor to halve the Su-35&#x27;s frontal radar cross-section and minimise the detection range of enemy radars. The radar cross section of the Su-35 is reportedly 1 to 3 square meters. The multi-role Su-35 can deploy air-to-air missiles of up to range, and can carry the heavy Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, as well as a multitude of air-to-ground weaponry.

The Su-35 is powered by a pair of Saturn AL-41F1S turbofan engines, formerly known as &quot;izdeliye&quot; (Product) 117S. A highly upgraded variant of the AL-31F, the AL-41F1S is closely related to the Su-57&#x27;s Saturn AL-41F1 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 117), differing primarily in the engine control system. The engines are equipped with thrust-vectoring nozzles, which have their rotational axes canted at an angle; the nozzles operate in one plane for pitch, but the canting allows the aircraft to produce both roll and yaw by vectoring each engine nozzle differently; this configuration was first implemented on the Su-30MKI and is also used on the Su-57. The Su-35&#x27;s thrust-vectoring system and integrated flight- and propulsion-control systems allow the aircraft to attain 9-&quot;g&quot; manoeuvres and &quot;supermaneuverability&quot;, enabling it to perform post-stall manoeuvres at low speeds. This differs from Western air combat doctrine, which emphasises the maintenance of a fighter aircraft&#x27;s kinetic energy. The engine gives the Su-35 the limited ability to sustain supersonic speed above Mach 1.1 without the use of afterburners, also known as &quot;supercruise&quot;.

===Testing and production===
Following the completion of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its maiden flight. On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky. Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its maiden flight on 2 October from KnAAPO&#x27;s Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled maiden flight, the fourth Su-35 (there&#x27;s a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier at the end of the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. The cause of the accident was the failure of the engine management system, as a result of which the afterburner was not turned off.

Although the Su-35 project was aimed primarily at the export market, the actual launch order for 48 Su-35S aircraft was placed by the Russian Defence Ministry at the 2009 MAKS Air Show (as part of a larger deal worth US$2.5 billion for 64 fighter aircraft). During the early stages of the flight-test programme, Sukhoi estimated that there was such a market for 160 aircraft, with a particular emphasis on Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Some of the candidate countries, such as Algeria, Malaysia, and India, were already operators of the Su-30MK family. As the aircraft was to be available for export starting in 2010, During the type&#x27;s international debut at the 2013 Paris Air Show, Mikhail Pogosyan, General Director of Sukhoi&#x27;s parent company United Aircraft Corporation, stated that there was an estimated demand for 200 aircraft, split evenly between the domestic and export markets. It was not until the end of 2015 when the first export contract was signed with China; by then, the Russian government had placed a follow-up order for 50 aircraft.

Apart from the launch order at the 2009 MAKS Air Show, the Russian government and the state-owned Vnesheconombank development bank agreed to provide Sukhoi with capital for the aircraft&#x27;s production. In November 2009, KnAAPO (which was renamed KnAAZ in 2013 after it became part of the Sukhoi Company) started manufacturing the first production aircraft, the general assembly of which was completed in October 2010; by then, pilots and engineers had successfully completed preliminary tests of the aircraft&#x27;s systems. The first Su-35S took its maiden flight in May 2011, and would be delivered (along with other aircraft) to Akhtubinsk to start state joint tests with the Defence Ministry to prepare the aircraft for service. Because production of the Su-35S occurred alongside trials, some early-production aircraft were later modified as a result of such tests. In December 2018, United Aircraft Corporation has reported 100th serial Su-35S was produced at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant.

==Operational history==

===Russia===
In 1996, three production Su-27Ms were delivered to the air force&#x27;s 929th State Flight Test Centre named for V. P. Chkalov (GLITs) at , Akhtubinsk, to perform weapons trials. In 2001, the air force decided to transfer several Su-27Ms to re-equip the Russian Knights aerobatics team, and so the team&#x27;s pilots took familiarisation flights with the aircraft. The three production and two other pre-production Su-27Ms arrived at the team&#x27;s Kubinka air base near Moscow in 2003. However, they were used as a source of spare parts for other aircraft in the demonstration fleet.
Initially, one static and three flyable prototypes (bort no. 901, 902, 904) were built between 2007 and 2009. The third one (bort no. 904) was later destroyed when it crashed into a barrier during its taxi runs.

The first contract for 48 production aircraft was signed at the 2009 MAKS Air show in Moscow. In May 2011, Sukhoi delivered the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry to prepare for operational service. The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights to test the type&#x27;s technical characteristics, which were assessed by the end of that year to have generally complied with requirements. A batch of six production aircraft was handed over in December 2012. In February 2013, five of these at the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky started the second stage of the trials, focusing on the Su-35&#x27;s weapons and combat maneuverability.

Twelve production Su-35Ss were delivered in December 2013, followed by another twelve production aircraft in February 2014, ten of which were handed over to the 23rd Fighter Aviation Regiment stationed in the Far East with the remaining two tasked with carrying out the final phase of state joint tests. The handover marked its official entry into operational service. Several Su-35Ss were later transferred to Lipetsk to further develop combat tactics and to train service personnel. The Russia&#x27;s Su-35Ss are also permanently based at Besovets air base near the Finnish border, and at Centralnaya Uglovaya air base near Vladivostok.
The introduction of the Su-35S into the service with the Russian Aerospace Forces is a part of the Russia&#x27;s state armament programme for 2011–2020 that was formulated following the war with Georgia in 2008 with an aim to significantly increase the number of modern military equipment in the Russian Armed Forces. The aircraft is delivered alongside the Su-30M2 and Su-30SM and the heavier Su-34 strike aircraft. The first two are domestic variants of KnAAPO&#x27;s Su-30MK2 and Irkut&#x27;s Su-30MKI two-seat export aircraft. According to reports, the simultaneous acquisition of three fighter derivatives of the original Su-27 was to support the two aircraft manufacturers amidst a slump in export orders. The Su-30M2 serves as a trainer aircraft for the Su-35.

The Su-35S attained full operational capability (FOC) in late 2018.

In July 2020, the Russian Knights aerobatic team received eight new Su-35Ss as an addition to its previously acquired Su-30SM aircraft.

The 185th Combat Training and Combat Application Center, also known as an aggressor squadron of the Russian Aerospace Forces, has received three new Su-35S on 9 September 2022.

====2015 Russian military intervention in Syria====

In January 2016, Russia made the first combat deployment of the Su-35S when it sent four aircraft to Syria. This occurred following the increased tensions between Russia and Turkey as result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into the Turkish airspace and the shooting down of a Russian Su-24 bomber by a Turkish F-16 fighter in November 2015. Its combat deployment to Syria helped to find and subsequently resolve number of problems, for example with the aircraft avionics. Su-35s in Syria have been seen carrying unguided bombs, with Russian sources claiming that the Su-35 has carried out strikes against ground targets using guided weapons.
On 20 August 2019, two Russian Aerospace Forces Su-35Ss, operating from the Khmeimim Air Base, intercepted two Turkish Air Force F-16s over the southern Idlib and forced them to leave the Syrian airspace. Russian Su-35Ss again intercepted several Israeli aircraft over southern Syria on 10 September 2019 and prevented them from carrying out airstrikes. Another interception allegedly occurred on 19 September 2019, when two Russian Su-35Ss intercepted Israeli aircraft preparing to attack suburbs of Damascus. On 15 October 2019, a Turkish F-16 fighter was intercepted by Russian Su-35Ss and forced to retreat as it was attempting to bomb the Syrian Democratic Forces&#x27;s headquarters in Manbij. On 12 November 2019, Russian Su-35Ss intercepted an Israeli fighter during airstrikes on Damascus. On 7 December 2019, several Israeli aircraft were intercepted by Russian Su-35Ss and forced to retreat during an attempt to bomb the T-4 Airbase.

====2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====

Russian Su-30SM and Su-35S fighters were used for air superiority missions during the war. At least seven air-to-air victories were reported over Ukrainian fighters and one over a Ukrainian Naval Aviation Mil Mi-14.

On 3 April 2022, a Russian Su-35S was shot down by Ukrainian forces, with the pilot ejecting and being captured; the pilot stated that his Su-35S was shot down near Izyum while battling Ukrainian air defenses. On 9 May, the Ukraine Defence Ministry confirmed that Colonel Ihor Bedzay, the deputy head of the Ukrainian Navy Aviation Office, was killed in action. His Mi-14PS was shot down by a Russian Su-35.

On 19 July 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force command claimed that a Su-35 was shot down by Ukrainian air defences near Kakhovka, but at the time there were no photos confirming the loss. In early February 2023, photos of the crash site emerged, confirming the crashed plane was an Su-35S.

On 14 May 2023, a Ukrainian MIM-104 Patriot missile shot down a Su-35 fighter over Bryansk region. On 22 May 2023, another Ukrainian MIM-104 Patriot missile shot down a Su-35 over Bryansk region.

On 28 September 2023, a Russian S-300 surface-to-air missile shot down a friendly Su-35 near the Tokmak region. The preliminary report suggests the S-300 missile&#x27;s fire control radar could not identify friend or foe, leading to a friendly fire incident that downed the Su-35.

Ministry of Defense of Ukraine claimed that Ukrainian air defences shot down two Su-35s in February 2024. According to them this was its &quot;greatest results in downing Russian jets since October 2022&quot; when they claimed to have downed ten Su-34s and one A-50 that month. 

According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Russia has lost more than five Su-35 fighters since the beginning of the Ukraine war, either to friendly fire, crashed or Ukrainian forces shooting down the aircraft using Western-supplied air defences.

=== China ===
During the early 1990s, sales arrangements for the Su-27M were discussed with China. In 1995, Sukhoi officials announced a co-production proposal contingent on Beijing&#x27;s agreement to purchase 120 aircraft. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry allegedly blocked the sale of the Su-27M and Tupolev Tu-22M bomber over concerns about the arrangements for Chinese production of the Su-27 derivatives.

In November 2015, China became the Su-35&#x27;s first export customer when the Russian and Chinese governments signed a contract worth $2 billion to buy 24 aircraft for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. This deal drew international commentaries due to its significance. David Ochmanek of RAND Corporation said the deal &quot;serves both countries&quot;, as Russia relied on foreign sales to maintain its military production capacity, while China sought to enhance its military capabilities through the advanced weapon platforms such as the Su-35. However, the low number of purchases also signified that the deal was symbolic in nature, as the two countries are still competing over influence in Central Asia, according to Moritz Rudolf of Mercator Institute for China Studies. Ben Moores of IHS believed the Su-35 deal would be the last major order from China, as the Sino-Russian military cooperation saw &quot;very little action or real substance. China doesn&#x27;t need Russia as much as Russia needs China.&quot;

Chinese officials had reportedly first shown interest in the Su-35 in 2006, it was not until Zhuhai Airshow 2010 that Alexander Mikheyev of the Rosoboronexport, the Russian state agency responsible for the export and import of defence products, signified that Russia was ready to start talks with China over the Su-35. Russian officials publicly confirmed that talks had been going on in 2012, when a protocol agreement on the purchase was signed. There were subsequent reports of the two countries signing a contract and of imminent deliveries, but negotiations would not actually conclude until 2015.

Sales discussions were protracted due to intellectual property rights concerns. China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were fears of China copying the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage, Rosoboronexport demanded that China issue a legally binding guarantee against copying. Chinese industry was reportedly interested in the AL-41F1S engine and Irbis-E radar. According to &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, China held a specific interest in the Su-35&#x27;s engine, and was already test-flying the J-11D, which reportedly has less range, payload, and maneuverability than the Su-35 but has an active electronically scanned array radar instead of the less advanced PESA radar of the Su-35. Rosoboronexport insisted on China purchasing a minimum of 48 aircraft to offset risks of copying; after the Kremlin intervened in 2012, the minimum quantity was lowered to 24. Another problem was China&#x27;s insistence that the Su-35 include Chinese-made components and avionics. The Kremlin again intervened and conceded to this demand, allowed the deal to proceed; it was viewed as a major concession since the sales of such components are reportedly lucrative. The contract did not include any technology transfer.

The Chinese military received the first four aircraft in December 2016. Followed by the first delivery, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s website opined that with the J-20&#x27;s commissioning, Russia understood that the Su-35 would &quot;lose its value on the Chinese market in the near future...we hope very much that Su-35 will be the last (combat) aircraft China imports.&quot; China has received a second batch of ten aircraft in 2017, and another ten in 2018. The Su-35S entered service with PLAAF in April 2018, and are based in Guangdong province in southeast China. In June 2019, Russia offered China a second batch of Su-35s. According to &quot;Asia Times&quot;, Chinese source remarked further purchase of Su-35 is not feasible as Russian jet offers little value over the Chinese J-16, due to the latter having superior radar, avionics and other equipment.

On 20 September 2018, the U.S. imposed sanctions on China&#x27;s Equipment Development Department and its director, Li Shangfu, for engaging in ″significant transactions″ with Rosoboronexport, specifically naming China&#x27;s purchase of ten Su-35s in 2017 as well as S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018.

===Iran===
Following the Russian purchase of Iranian suicide drones during the invasion in Ukraine, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) is reportedly considering the procurement of the Sukhoi Su-35 in exchange for further delivery of ammunition, drones and ballistic missiles to the Russian Armed Forces, according to US officials. It was also reported that training of Iranian pilots has begun in Spring 2022 and that the aircraft may be delivered in 2023. The deal may include 24 Su-35s originally built for Egypt, but no official reports of delivery have emerged so far. The deal was confirmed by Iranian state-owned media Tasnim News Agency on 28 December 2022 and on 15 January 2023 by an Iranian MP who said that supplies will begin in the spring and also said that Iran has ordered from Russia air defense and missile systems as well as helicopters.

However, in July 2023, the Iranian Defense Minister, Mohammad-Reza Gharaei Ashtiani, made vague statements alluding that Iran is reconsidering the acquisition of the Su-35 due to increasing investment towards indigenous fighter building capabilities, leading to some sources to declare that the deal has collapsed. Despite this, the Iranian Air Force has received deliveries of the Yak-130 advanced jet trainer, which are used to train aspiring cadets before they graduate to actual fighter aircraft, such as the Su-35. The trainers have received IRIAF livery and serial numbers. On 28 November 2023, Iran&#x27;s deputy defense minister announced that Iran had finalized a deal for the purchase of Su-35 aircraft from Russia, although further details on the quantity or timeline were not shared. An order for 24 Su-35s was reported in April 2024, but these reports were denied by Iran&#x27;s SNN media agency. In January 2025, Ali Shadmani, a senior commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that Su-35s had been purchased by Iran, without precising how many were procured and whether deliveries had started.

===Potential operators===

====United Arab Emirates====
In the mid-1990s, the United Arab Emirates evaluated the Su-27M, but later acquired the Mirage 2000 due to the country&#x27;s close relationship with France. In February 2017, the country was to sign a preliminary agreement for the Su-35 purchase and also signed an agreement with Rostec, Russia&#x27;s state-owned corporation responsible for the development of advanced industrial products, to develop a fifth-generation aircraft based on the MiG-29.

====India====
India has been reluctant to order the Sukhoi/HAL FGFA due to high cost, and it has been reported that India and Russia are studying an upgrade to the Su-35 with stealth technology (similar to the F-15 Silent Eagle) as a more affordable alternative to the FGFA (Su-57). The aircraft is competing with 7 other aircraft in a fresh tender which is referred as MMRCA 2.0 in the Indian media, for the procurement of 114 multi-role combat aircraft.

====Algeria====
According to &quot;Kommersant&quot;, the Algerian military had requested a Su-35 for testing in February 2016; it was reported the country was satisfied with the fighter&#x27;s flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. On 27 December 2019, Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes purchase of Su-34 and Su-57 fighters. However, neither Russian nor Algerian governments ever confirmed that such deal exists.

====Turkey====
In July 2019, Russia offered the Su-35 to Turkey after it was removed from the F-35 programme by United States due to the purchase of the S-400 missile system. CEO of Rostec Sergey Chemezov, said, &quot;If our Turkish colleagues express a desire, we are ready to work out the deliveries of Su-35 fighter jets&quot;. Previously in May 2019, Sergey Chemezov had said that Russia was ready to cooperate with Turkey on the export and local production of the Su-57.

====Others====
Following the deployment to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly expressed interest in the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35. Sudan has reportedly also expressed an interest in acquiring of the Su-35 fighters during the Sudanese president Omar Hassan al-Bashir&#x27;s visitation of Moscow in November 2017.

===Failed bids===
====Brazil====
In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian authorities conducted talks on the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least 12 aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force&#x27;s ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country&#x27;s aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would have participated in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, it would have been the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.

With the tender relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to purchase at least 36 aircraft – with a potential for 84 additional aircraft – to replace the country&#x27;s A-1Ms, F-5BRs and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was selected because of its low cost and the transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry.

====Egypt====
In March 2019, it was reported that Egypt would procure &quot;over two dozen&quot; Su-35s from Russia in a deal valued about $US2 billion, finalized in late 2018. Deliveries were expected to begin as early as 2020 or 2021. Deputy head of the Rosoboronexport Sergei Kornev denied the signing of any contract to supply Su-35s to Egypt. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Egypt against buying Su-35s, saying &quot;if those systems were to be purchased, the CAATSA statute would require sanctions on the regime.&quot;

On 19 May 2020, Russia began Su-35 production for Egypt, and first five production aircraft took off from the KnAAZ plant on 28 July 2020. By June 2021, in total 17 aircraft were produced for Egypt. Egyptian newspaper Arabo reported on 5 January 2022, Egypt, Algeria and Indonesia announced that they would cancel their Su-35 orders with Russia. In March 2022, an agreement with the US to sell variants of F-15Es to the Egyptian Air Force was announced which confirms that Egypt either abandoned or cancelled the Su-35 deal and the planes originally produced for Egypt will be delivered to Iran instead. A contract needs to be finalized after price and delivery date are determined.

====Indonesia====
In 2014, Russia offered the Su-35 for Indonesia&#x27;s Northrop F-5E replacement competition. In 2015, the Su-35 was selected based on the Indonesian Air Force&#x27;s familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2; the other competitors were the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16 and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. A contract for 11 aircraft was signed in February 2018; half of the price was to be being paid for in commodities. The first two aircraft were expected to be delivered in October.

As of May 2024, no aircraft have been delivered. In March 2020, Bloomberg reported the purchase was cancelled due to American pressure; Indonesia and Russia denied the cancellation. In December 2021, Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Fadjar Prasetyo said that the purchase would be cancelled for budgetary reasons. In June 2023, the Indonesian Ministry of Defense reported that the purchase was hampered by the threat of American sanctions through CAATSA and OFAC. In May 2024, Jose Tavares, the Indonesian Ambassador to Russia, stated that the contract remained in force.

====Others====
In 1996, Russia submitted the Su-27M and Su-37 for South Korea&#x27;s F-X programme, which sought a 40-aircraft replacement for the Republic of Korea Air Force&#x27;s F-4D/Es, RF-4Cs and F-5E/Fs. The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and F-15K Slam Eagle. Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased-grid radar and thrust-vectoring engines, and offered full technology transfer as well as final assembly in South Korea. The US$5 billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt-reduction deal on money Russia owed to South Korea. However, the Su-27M was eliminated early in the competition, which was won by the F-15K.

A country that had been reported to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chávez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35,

Libya was also expected to be an early export customer for 12 to 15 Su-35s along with other Russian weapons; however, the civil war in Libya and the resulting military intervention cancelled such plans. Russia has also offered the modernized Su-35 to India, Malaysia, and Greece; no firm contracts have materialised, with the first two countries having been occupied with other fighter projects and unlikely to procure the modernized Su-35.

==Variants==
;Su-27M/Su-35: Single-seat fighter design with a factory code of T-10M (&quot;Modernizerovany&quot;, &quot;Upgraded&quot;). The first two prototypes had a new forward fuselage, canards and updated fly-by-wire flight-control systems. Like three of KNAAPO&#x27;s nine flying pre-production aircraft (T10M-5, T10M-6 and T10M-7), they were converted from Su-27 airframes. The third aircraft (T10M-3) was the first of seven pre-production aircraft to have the taller vertical tails, two-wheel nose undercarriage and in-flight refuel capability. The Su-27M was powered by AL-31FM turbofan engines. Two prototypes, nine pre-production and three production aircraft were constructed by 1995; two static-test aircraft was also constructed (T10M-0 and T10M-4). The aircraft did not enter mass production.
;Su-37: Technology demonstrator, converted from the eleventh developmental Su-27M (T10M-11). The Su-37 featured a digital fly-by-wire flight-control system, a glass cockpit, the N011M radar, and AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. The aircraft was later fitted with standard-production AL-31F engines, and had its flight-control system and cockpit systems revised.
;Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer designed and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the canards and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a forward fuselage similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it had a different fly-by-wire flight-control system to accommodate the canards. The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB was designed to be fully combat-capable.
;Su-35BM: Single-seat fighter that is a major redesign of the original Su-27. The type features significant modifications to the airframe, including the removal of canards and dorsal air brake as found on the Su-27M. It features the updated N035 Irbis-E radar and a redesigned cockpit. The aircraft is powered by thrust-vectoring AL-41F1S turbofan engines that are capable of supercruise. Also known as T-10BM (&quot;Bolshaya Modernizatsiya&quot;, &quot;Major Modernization&quot;), Su-35BM is not the actual designation used by Sukhoi, who markets the aircraft as &quot;Su-35&quot;.
;Su-35S: Su-35S is the production designator for the T-10BM design for the Russian Aerospace Forces. According to &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot;, &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;Stroyevoy&quot; (&quot;Combatant&quot;). NATO reporting name Flanker-M. The Flanker M is the latest version of the Sukhoi Su-35, known internally as the Su-35BM (bolshaya modernizatsiya – big modernization), and is an advanced capability multirole air superiority fighter developed from the Su-27. The aircraft has high maneuverability (+9g) with a high angle of attack, and is equipped with high-capability weapon systems that contribute to the new aircraft’s exceptional dogfighting capability. The Russian Air Force ordered 48 Sukhoi Su-35S fighters in August 2009 with deliveries scheduled to run until 2015. Sukhoi began producing the components required for assembly of the aircraft in November 2009. An information management system integrated with onboard subsystems and a new phased array radar system with long-range aerial target detection have been installed in the aircraft. The first Su-35S aircraft was handed over to the 929th State Flight Test Centre (GLITS) for flight tests in August 2011. The Russian Ministry of Defence received six Su-35S production aircraft from Sukhoi in December 2012. In 2015, China ordered 24 Su-35S aircraft for China’s People’s Liberation Army Air Force.

<doc id="314293" wikidata="Q3051006" url="?curid=314293" title="Promontory, Utah">
<text>Promontory is an area of high ground in Box Elder County, Utah, United States, 32 mi (51 km) west of Brigham City and 66 mi (106 km) northwest of Salt Lake City. Rising to an elevation of 4,902 feet (1,494 m) above sea level, it lies to the north of the Promontory Mountains and the Great Salt Lake. It is notable as the location of Promontory Summit, where the first transcontinental railroad in the United States, from Sacramento to Omaha, was officially completed on May 10, 1869. The location is sometimes confused with Promontory Point, a location further south along the southern tip of the Promontory Mountains. Both locations are significant to the Overland Route: Promontory Summit was where the original, now abandoned, alignment crossed just north of the Promontory Mountains; while Promontory Point is where the modern alignment, called the Lucin Cutoff, crosses the southern tip of the Promontory Mountains.

By the summer of 1868, the Central Pacific (CP) had completed the first rail route through the Sierra Nevada mountains, and was now moving down towards the Interior Plains and the Union Pacific (UP) line. More than 4,000 workers, of whom two thirds were Chinese, had laid more than of track at altitudes above . In May 1869, the railheads of the Union Pacific and the Central Pacific railroads finally met at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. A specially-chosen Chinese and Irish crew had taken only 12 hours to lay the final of track in time for the ceremony.

==Golden Spike==

Promontory Summit, Utah Territory, had been agreed upon as the point where the two railheads would officially meet, following meetings in Washington, D.C., in April 1869, where it was also agreed that a ceremony would be held to drive in the Last Spike to commemorate the occasion. However, the original date of May 8 had to be postponed for two days because of bad weather and a labor dispute on the Union Pacific side. Over 400 laid-off unpaid graders and tie cutters chained U.P.R.R. Vice-President Thomas Durant&#x27;s dignitary railcar to a siding in Piedmont, Wyoming, until he wired for money to pay them. After almost a two-day delay, when Durant&#x27;s train arrived at the Devil&#x27;s Gate Bridge in Wyoming, floodwaters turned a mild creek into a raging torrent, which threatened to collapse the railroad bridge. The engineer would not take his locomotive, whose number is lost to history, across the rickety structure, but he gave each of the passenger cars a hefty heave. The cars coasted across, but Durant no longer had a way to get to Promontory. A hasty telegraph to Ogden, Utah Territory, sent Union Pacific&#x27;s engine &quot;119&quot; to the rescue. After a hearty party in Ogden the night of May 9, the dignitaries arrived at Promontory Summit on the morning of May 10, where the Golden Spike Ceremony was finally planned and took place, with the last iron spike driven at 12:47 PM.
The trains carrying the railroads&#x27; officials were drawn by Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;No. 119&quot; and Central Pacific&#x27;s &quot;No. 60&quot; (officially named the &quot;Jupiter&quot;) locomotives, neither of which had been originally chosen for the ceremony. The Central Pacific had originally chosen their no. 29 &quot;Antelope&quot; to attend the ceremony, while the Union Pacific had also chosen another, unidentified engine for their train, but both engines encountered mishaps en route to the ceremony. On May 10, the Jupiter and 119 were drawn up face-to-face on Promontory Summit, separated only by the width of a single tie. It is unknown how many people attended the event; estimates run from as low as 500 to as many as 3,000 government and railroad officials and track workers. The lack of Chinese workers seen in the official portrait has been ascribed to anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. However, their absence may have been the result of the timing of the famous photograph: 
The more famous A.J. Russell photograph could not include the Chinese workers photographed earlier participating in the joining of the rails ceremony, because at the moment the famous photo was being taken it was after the conclusion of the ceremony and the Chinese workers were away from the two locomotives to dine at J.H. Strobridge&#x27;s boarding car, being honored and cheered by the CPRR (Central Pacific Railroad) management.
Three of the eight Chinese workers who brought up the last rail were guests of honor at the Promontory Summit&#x27;s golden anniversary celebrations in Ogden, Utah in May 1919.
The event at Promontory Summit was billed as the &quot;wedding of the rails&quot; and was officiated by the Reverend John Todd. Four precious metal spikes were ceremoniously driven (gently tapped with a special spike maul sporting a solid silver head into pre-drilled holes in the Laurelwood tie); one was the golden spike issued by Californian David Hewes, one was a second solid gold spike issued by the San Francisco Newsletter Newspaper, one was a solid silver spike issued by the State of Nevada, and one was an iron spike plated with silver on the shaft and gold on the top issued by Arizona Territory and presented by Arizona Territorial Governor Anson P.K. Safford from the Territorial Capitol of Prescott. In 1898, the golden &#x27;Hewes&#x27; spike was donated to the Leland Stanford Junior University Museum.

In one account, the second Golden Spike and the Laurelwood Tie were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, which also destroyed the San Francisco Newsletter Newspaper Offices where these artifacts were on display. In Union Pacific&#x27;s account, the location of the &quot;second, lower-quality golden spike ...faded into obscurity&quot;.

Stanford University loaned the original 1869 gold spike to Cecil B. DeMille for the film &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939). It was held aloft in the scene commemorating the actual event, although a brass prop was used for the hammering sequence. The only marks on The Golden Spike were caused by a Union Army Officer who struck the Spike with the pommel of his sword four times on the ride back to California. Nobody tried to fully drive 17.6 Carat Solid Gold Spikes or any of the precious metal spikes into a wooden tie. Four holes had been drilled into the Laurelwood tie to &quot;hold&quot; the spikes while Stanford and UPRR&#x27;s Thomas Durant gently tapped them before the Spikes and the Laurelwood Tie were removed to make way for a regular pine wood tie and four regular iron spikes, the last one was wired to the Transcontinental Telegraph Line. Stanford and Durant were supposed to strike the last iron spike with a regular iron spike hammer, also wired to the Telegraph Line, to send a signal from coast-to-coast as the job was done. Stanford missed the Spike, hitting the wooden tie instead; however, the telegraph operator hit his key as though Stanford had hit the spike. Durant missed the spike and the tie entirely; but likewise, the operator hit his key so the Nation would not know the difference. Then the operator sent the message D-O-N-E! With the railroad&#x27;s completion, a trip across the Nation went from up to six months on foot, on an animal, or in an animal-pulled wagon to as little as eight days from city of New York, via railroads and ferries, to San Francisco.

Promontory Summit marks the site where the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed May 10, 1869, from Omaha to Sacramento, but not &quot;from the Missouri river to the Pacific&quot; as called for by the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. Western Pacific completed the final leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay on September 6, 1869, with the last spike at the Mossdale Bridge spanning the San Joaquin River near Lathrop, California. Passengers had to cross the Missouri River by boat between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, until the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge was built in March 1872. In the meantime, the first uninterrupted coast-to-coast railroad was established in August 1870 at Strasburg, Colorado, with the completion of the Denver extension of the Kansas Pacific Railway.

==Later use==
Promontory was the site of Promontory City during and shortly after the construction of the transcontinental railroad. However, by December 1869, the shops, tents, and store fronts were being dismantled as the traders and merchants moved to other towns. In January 1870, the train crews from the CP and UP had been relocated to Ogden, Utah, where Union Station had effectively become the meeting point of the two railroads. Promontory Station had a CP station agent and telegraph operator, a Chinese section gang, and gravel train crew. By June 1870, the population at Promontory Summit had been reduced to about 120 people. Most were employees of the CP railroad. The only exceptions were a hotel/eatery owner, his family, and 80 miners of copper sulfate.

Almost immediately CP began an extensive redevelopment of the rail infrastructure on and through Promontory Summit. The CP realigned about 10 miles of the original UP line east of Promontory Summit (on grade CP had surveyed) in 1870, replacing some of the UP’s steep grades and tight curves; in addition it got a roundhouse and turntable, a freight depot and locomotive yard. It also gained extensive support facilities for railroad workers, including an eating car, engine helper station, and quarters for the Chinese section crew.

In the final decades of the 19th century, Promontory Station was used by large ranching firms, such as those of John W. Kerr, John L. Edwards, and Charles Crocker, to ship their cattle to the stockyards in San Francisco and Chicago. At the turn of the 20th century, wheat farmers had begun to change the landscape around Promontory with farms and families. Promontory had a one-room school, as well as a commercial store/post office; it had become the main crossroads stop for small farms. However, during the droughts of the 1930s, individual farmers moved away from Promontory, leading to the consolidation of their lands into large holdings.

==Decline==
Although Union Pacific engineers had initially considered a direct route across the Great Salt Lake, cost and schedule constraints forced them to opt for the surveyed line through Promontory. As trains became longer and heavier, additional engines were often required to pull them along the winding curves and up steep grades to the Promontory summit.

This changed when the Southern Pacific, which had acquired Central Pacific operations in 1885, built a wooden railroad trestle across the Great Salt Lake between Ogden and Lucin, between February 1902 and March 1904. The Lucin Cutoff completely bypassed Promontory Summit. The last regularly scheduled transcontinental passenger train to pass through Promontory station was on Sunday, September 18, 1904. When the Great Depression led to a dramatic fall in revenues from railroad traffic, the Southern Pacific decided to abandon the line when it failed to meet its operating costs. On September 8, 1942, an &quot;unspiking&quot; ceremony was held to commemorate the lifting of the last rail over Promontory Summit; the old steel rails were used for the war effort in World War II.

In the 1950s, the wooden trestle was replaced with a parallel concrete-stone causeway built by the Morrison–Knudsen construction company. Southern Pacific continued to maintain the wooden trestle as a backup for several decades, although its last significant rail traffic was in the early 1960s.

By the 1980s, the trestle&#x27;s condition had begun to seriously deteriorate. Beginning in March 1993, the timber from the trestle has been salvaged and removed.

==Preservation==
By the early 1950s, a number of re-enactments of the driving of the last spike had been held at Promontory Summit. The renewed interest led to a concerted effort to save the historic site. In 1957, local campaigners succeeded in getting the area recognized by the federal government, but without federal land ownership. The Southern Pacific, which still owned the right of way, agreed to give its holdings to the federal management. On July 30, 1965 the Act for the Golden Spike National Historic Site was signed into law. The area is administered by the National Park Service.

On the 110th anniversary of the &quot;Golden Spike&quot; on May 10, 1979, two purpose-built replicas of the &quot;UP #119&quot; and the &quot;Jupiter #60&quot; were brought together on a specially relaid 1.5-mile section of track. As the original &quot;Jupiter&quot; had been scrapped for iron in 1901 and &quot;No. 119&quot; had been broken up two years later, the two replica locomotives were built in California with $1.5 million of federal funds. They were reconstructed using scaled-up measurements taken from photographs of the original engines and reference to similar engines of the time.

The park, which has a visitor center and an engine house, is open throughout the year. Several walking trails and audio driving tours allow visitors to see the old cuts along the permanent way, highlighting the effort needed to construct the railroad over Promontory Summit. On every Saturday and holiday between May 1 and Labor Day, the two replica locomotives are lined up to re-enact the &quot;Golden Spike&quot; ceremony.

On the 150th anniversary of the completion of the railroad on May 10, 2019, the contributions of the 15,000 Chinese railroad workers were finally acknowledged. Records of the Chinese railroad workers had not been kept and it is believed thousands of people died laying those tracks due to the treacherous territory, including having to cut through the cold of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the heat of the desert. Many descendants of the Chinese workers were at Promontory Summit for the occasion. A traditional Chinese lion dance opened the ceremony. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Elaine Chao (the first person of Chinese descent to hold the position), paid tribute to those Chinese workers.

<text>Kempston is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Bedford, Bedfordshire, England, situated around south-west of Bedford town centre. It had a population of 19,330 in the 2011 census, and forms part of the wider Bedford built-up area. The River Great Ouse separates it from the Queen&#x27;s Park area of Bedford.

==History==
Until the 19th century Kempston was a mainly rural parish. It was one of the largest in Bedfordshire with an area of 5,025 acres (20 km2) at the time of enclosure in 1804, and was in Redbournestoke Hundred. Historically there was no central village, but instead settlement was divided between a number of hamlets called &quot;Ends&quot;, including Up End, Bell End, Wood End and Box End. Kempston&#x27;s parish church, All Saints, was in Church End, which was not the largest end but was fairly central to the parish. In the 19th century East End, Bell End and Up End began to coalesce into a larger settlement. In 1870 developers began to attempt to develop land on the road from Kempston to Bedford under the name &quot;Kempston New Town&quot;. Construction was slow at first, but the new district soon began to expand steadily and Kempston acquired a more urban feel. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Kempston Barracks in 1876.

On 1 April 1896 the parish was divided into &quot;Kempston&quot; (in Kempston Urban District) and of Kempston Rural . The Urban District was based on East End, Up End and Kempston New Town all of which are in the north eastern part of the parish close to Bedford, and had 86.8% of the total population at the 1901 census. Kempston Rural was three times larger, but remained sparsely populated. Church End, with Kempston&#x27;s original parish church, was included in the Kempston Rural parish and remains a small hamlet today.

A gravel pit was opened at Hill Grounds in the 1860s and the area around Bunyan Road was known as &#x27;Gravel End&#x27; in 1877. The growth of the area of Kempston formerly known as &#x27;Up End&#x27; is thought to be due largely to the employment opportunities presented by the gravel pits in this area, including that at Hill Grounds. From around 1910 until the early 1930s the Kempston gravel pit railway served the Hill Grounds pit.

The growth of Kempston&#x27;s population levelled off in the early decades of the 20th century, with a rise of just 12% between 1901 and 1931, but it then began to expand rapidly. The 1951 population of just under 10,000 was 60% higher than that of 1931; in the second half of the 20th century, the population nearly doubled. In 1974 Kempston Urban District was abolished and Kempston parish was renamed &quot;Kempston Urban&quot; and became part of the Borough of Bedford but with a separate town council with minor powers. On 25 March 1975 the parish was renamed back to &quot;Kempston&quot;. For borough election purposes the town is divided into four wards called Kempston Central and East, Kempston North, Kempston South and Kempston West. Kempston Rural remains a civil parish and is part of Turvey Ward for borough election purposes.

===Population table===
Note 1: 1981 figures are provisional (more up to date source needed).
Note 2: The 2001 Kempston Urban figure is the combined total for the three urban wards of Kempston East, Kempston North and Kempston South.

===Etymology===
The name in its old form is &quot;kemestun&quot; which includes the Brittonic word &quot;cambio&quot; meaning bent or curved. Therefore, the name meant when coined &quot;the enclosed settlement on the bend&quot;. The bend was that of the River Great Ouse, noted for its sharp bends upstream of Bedford. It is, however, also possible that &quot;cambita&quot; (the curved one) was the name given to this stretch of the river by the Celtic-speaking population. In this case the name could have developed like that of the river Kembs in the French Department of Haut Rhin. Kempston is also a family name for many individuals from British Ancestry. Kempston was recorded as &quot;camestone&quot; in the Domesday Book and had a 6th-century Anglo Saxon burial site, now home to the Saxon Centre.
The meaning of the name Kempston is not known for certain. The element &#x27;ton&#x27; is Old English and means a settlement of some sort. The most plausible meaning of the element &#x27;Caemb&#x27; is that it was the name of an Anglo-Saxon who owned the settlement. Thus we have the possessive case expressing this relationship by the &#x27;s.&#x27; The speculation that the element &#x27;Caemb&#x27; means bent or curved seems much less likely, because the river consists of many bends and curves and therefore the name would have been of no use in locating a particular settlement.

==Sport and leisure==

Kempston has a Non-League football team A.F.C. Kempston Rovers who play at Hillgrounds Leisure.

A short lived greyhound racing track was opened by the Box End (Kempston) Dog Club during 1932. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Racing continued for just two more years.

==Churches==
For many centuries, All Saints&#x27; Church in Church End, which was first Catholic and later Anglican, was the only place of worship in Kempston. It is attractively situated in a green churchyard close to the river, and the location is still rural. William the Conqueror&#x27;s niece Judith commissioned the west tower, nave and chancel in 1100. The tower arch and chancel arch remain from Norman times. The aisles were added in the 13th century. In the 15th century the windows were replaced, the tower was heightened and the nave walls were also heightened, forming a clerestory. The font is 14th-century. Refurbishments were carried out in the 19th century, and the north and south galleries were added at that time to accommodate children.

In the 19th century two additional Church of England churches were built to accommodate the rising population. The first was St John&#x27;s in Up End, which was consecrated in 1868. It soon suffered from subsidence, possibly caused by an underground stream. The burgeoning population of Kempston New Town was served by St Stephen&#x27;s, a temporary iron church in Spring Road which was built in 1888. After a member of the locally prominent Williamson family bequeathed £8,000 for the purpose in 1927 the Church of the Transfiguration (Transfiguration Church, Kempston) was built in Bedford Road to replace two unsatisfactory Victorian churches. It is a solid work in red brick and was consecrated in 1940. St John&#x27;s was unused as a church after that and was eventually demolished in 1965. St Stephen&#x27;s was sold to the Saunders&#x27; leather factory on nearby College St.

Methodism has been prominent in Kempston since the mid-19th century. The first Methodist chapel in the parish was built in Bell End in 1839, and its capacity was expanded by adding a gallery in 1843. In 1860 a larger replacement was constructed in the High Street at a cost of £600. The modern Kempston West Methodist Church now stands on the site. Kempston East Methodist Church in Bedford Road was opened in 1904 to serve the new parts of Kempston in the direction of Bedford. Sir Frederick Howard donated the site and £1,000, the Twentieth Century Trust provided another £1,000 and a local appeal raised around £3,000. The church is an attractive Gothic building in pale rustic Weldon stone, and has a hammerbeam roof. In addition to the two mainstream Methodist churches a small Primitive Methodist chapel was built in Bedford Road in or soon after 1896, when a site was purchased for £65 2s. 6d. It became Newtown Methodist chapel after the merger of the various Methodist churches in the 1930s, but it was sold off in 1959 and used for business purposes.

Kempston abuts both John Bunyan&#x27;s home parish of Elstow and Bedford, where he was imprisoned. The Bedford church now known as the Bunyan Meeting had members in Kempston from at least 1657, and ministers from the church sometimes preached in private houses in Kempston. The first Congregationalist church building in Kempston was opened in the High Street in 1813. A replacement church was built in Kempston New town in 1871. It was extended in 1888 and a hall was added in 1907.

Up until the Second World War Roman Catholics who lived in Kempston were obliged to worship at a church in Bedford. A Roman Catholic chapel was established during the war at the Army&#x27;s Grange Camp, which was situated where Hillgrounds is now, and it retained after 1945. The first resident Catholic priest in Kempston was appointed in 1965 and the present small and plain Catholic church in Bedford Road was built at around this time.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was first introduced in Bedford and Kempston by a missionary called Willard Richards on 1 August 1837. Bedfordshire was one of the first places in the British Isles to have an LDS Church organised: It was first introduced to the British Isles on 20 July 1837. Between that time and Willard Richards being called back to Preston on 7 March 1838 about 40 people were baptised members of the LDS Church in the Bedford area. Kempston still has Mormon missionaries and membership is steadily increasing. In 1986 the LDS Church completed the building of its Bedford Chapel/Meetinghouse. The Chapel stands near the north west corner of Addison Park close to The Grange. The plot was previously the location of the Kempston Liberal Club. The LDS Church previously met at Silver Jubilee School off Acacia Road in Bedford for at least six years before and various other locations in Bedford before that.

==Education==
There are four primary schools in the urban area: Balliol Primary School, Bedford Road Primary School, Camestone School and Springfield Primary School. Kempston Rural Primary School serves Kempston Rural. There are two secondary schools in Kempston: Kempston Academy and Daubeney Academy.

Grange Academy, Ridgeway School and St John&#x27;s School are all located in Kempston. These are special requirements schools for pupils from all over Bedford Borough.

==Estates==

Kempston&#x27;s main park is Addison Howard Park, which is part of the grounds of Grange House, once one of the principal residences in the parish, which survives as flats. This estate was owned in the 1880s by the Howard family (ancestors of the randlord Sir George Herbert Farrar Bt and the current Earl of Lonsdale) proprietors of the Britannia Iron Works in Bedford (opposite Bedford Hospital, and also known as George Fisher Castings, before its closure and demolition in the late 20th century). Scions of the Howard family were also settled at the nearby estates of Clapham Park and Biddenham Manor. Grange House was later donated by the Kempston branch of the Howard family to the people of Kempston. There is an indoor swimming pool which opened in the 1980s. Kempston&#x27;s Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket was the chain&#x27;s largest branch when it opened in the 1970s. The headquarters of the Bedfordshire Police are in Kempston.

Apart from All Saints&#x27; Church, the best-known historic buildings are the King William IV pub and Kempston Barracks. The King William is a timber-framed building in bold black and white. The exterior is 17th century, but it is believed to contain much medieval work.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The railway stations of and are located roughly to the north-east of the town, with the former being serviced by inter-city routes on the Midland Main Line as well as the Marston Vale Line, and the latter only being serviced by routes on the Marston Vale Line.
===Road===
The Bedford Southern Bypass on the A421, was constructed in the 1990s and links with the Kempston relief road, built in the 1980s. There is an out-of-town shopping centre called Kempston Interchange Retail Park alongside it, and Asda, Argos and Sainsbury&#x27;s distribution centres have opened at Marsh Leys site since the early 2000s. Formerly, the Sainsbury&#x27;s warehouse was a Woolworth&#x27;s distribution centre, until their bankruptcy in 2009. In 2007, work began on the Bedford Western Bypass which opened in 2010. The road cuts through Kempston Rural, crossing the Great Ouse between the urban area and Church End. In 2011 preliminary work began on extending the Western Bypass to join the A6 to the north of Bedford. In 2003 Bedford Borough Council adopted a planning brief for the land close to the Western bypass that proposes the construction of 1,000 new homes. In December 2010 work finished on construction of a new stretch of the A421 from Kempston to Junction 13 of the M1 motorway, this now provides a full dual carriageway link road between the A1 and the M1, with the construction of an additional section of dual carriageway between M1 J13 and Milton Keynes completed in 2020. The new dual-carriageway runs parallel to the existing road, which will be retained for local use.
===Bus===
Most bus services in the town connect to other destinations in Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes, with Uno buses C1, C10 and C11, Stagecoach buses 1 and 53, and Road Runner buses A1, A2, B, D, E and G serving the town.

<doc id="314298" wikidata="Q1859131" url="?curid=314298" title="Star Ferry">
<text>The Star Ferry () is a passenger ferry service operator and tourist attraction in Hong Kong. Its principal routes carry passengers across Victoria Harbour, between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. The service is operated by the Star Ferry Company, which was founded in 1888 as the Kowloon Ferry Company, and which adopted its present name in 1898.

With a fleet of twelve ferries, the company operates two routes across the harbour, carrying over 70,000 passengers per day, or 26 million per year. Even though the harbour is crossed by railway and road tunnels, the Star Ferry continues to provide a scenic yet inexpensive mode of harbour crossing. The company&#x27;s main route runs between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui.
==History==
Before the steam ferry service was first established, people would cross the harbour in sampans. In 1870, a man named Grant Smith brought a twin-screw wooden-hulled boat from England and started running it across the harbour at irregular intervals.

In July 1873, an attempt was made to run steam ferries between Hong Kong and Kowloon. This was stopped at the request of the British consul in Canton, who feared it would enable visits to gambling houses in Kowloon. It is thought that a service to the public was established in the mid-to-late 1870s, after the cession of Kowloon to the British in 1860.

The company was founded by Parsee merchant Dorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala as the &quot;Kowloon Ferry Company&quot; in 1888. Naorojee bought Smith&#x27;s boat, and later acquired two steam vessels from a Mr Buxoo, naming them &quot;Morning Star&quot; and &quot;Evening Star&quot;. 

At the time regular service was initiated, ships were moored by having a sailor on the vessel toss the rope to another on the pier, who would then catch it with a long billhook. This is still done today.

The popularity of this means of transport enabled him to increase his fleet to four vessels within 10 years: the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, &quot;Evening Star&quot;, &quot;Rising Star&quot; and &quot;Guiding Star&quot;. Each boat had a capacity of 100 passengers, and the boats averaged 147 crossings each day. He incorporated the business into the &quot;Star Ferry Co Ltd&quot; in 1898. The ship names and, subsequently, the company name was inspired by his love of Alfred Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot;, of which the first line reads &quot;Sunset and evening star, and one clear call for me!&quot;.

On his retirement in 1898, Naorojee sold the company to The Hongkong and Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company Limited, at that time owned by Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. and Sir Paul Chater.

A pier constructed on the western end of Salisbury Road opened in 1906, it was a fine massive structure at that time and it also had a separate compartment for the first and second class. However, it was destroyed by a typhoon in September 1906.

At the turn of the century, Hong Kong currency and Canton currency were both accepted as legal tender in Hong Kong. In the autumn of 1912, following a devaluation, the Star Ferry caused a controversy by insisting, together with the tramways, that payment had to be made in Hong Kong currency only. Canton coinage would no longer be accepted.

In 1924, the Yaumati Ferry operated the route to Kowloon in a duopoly. In 1933, the Star Ferry made history by building the &quot;Electric Star&quot;, the first diesel electric passenger ferry of its kind.

By 1941, the company had six vessels. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the competing Yaumati Ferry was allowed to continue, while the Japanese commandeered the Star Ferry for their own purposes. The &quot;Golden Star&quot; and the &quot;Meridian Star&quot; were used to transport prisoners of war from Sham Shui Po to Kai Tak Airport. In 1943, the &quot;Golden Star&quot; was bombed and sunk in the Canton River by the Americans, and the &quot;Electric Star&quot; was sunk in the harbour. After the war, the ferries were recovered and returned to service.

In the early 1950s, construction of the present twin-piered terminal commenced on both sides of Victoria Harbour, designed to handle 55 million passenger trips a year. The structure was completed in 1957, concurrent with the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier built on the island side.

The Star Ferry accepted the request by the government of operating the Hung Hom route in 1963. It almost failed to operate as the company thought it could not make profit from it. But with the reconsideration by the Star Ferry, the route was confirmed to be operating starting from March 1965.

Until the opening of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in 1972, the Star Ferry remained the main means of public transportation between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon side.

It was rated first in the &quot;Top 10 Most Exciting Ferry Rides&quot; poll by SATW (Society of American Travel Writers) in February 2009.

The Star Ferry operates on a franchise from the Government, which was last renewed in March 2018.

===Public protests===

In 1966, a fare increase of 5 cents (or 25%) of the ferry was a political milestone, as it caused a 27-year-old student to go on hunger strike in protest at the Edinburgh Place terminal. His arrest sparked the 1966 Hong Kong Riots.
On 11 November 2006, the end of an era was marked when the third generation pier in Central, the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier, ended its mission, along with the big clock tower. The pier was destroyed to make way for reclamation, amidst great controversy and peaceful but reasonable protests.

==Services==
===Existing===

The Star Ferry operates the following cross-harbour routes (the fares (in HK$ below) are effective from 9 February 2021):
*Central to Tsim Sha Tsui. For lower deck, it costs $4 on Mondays to Fridays; $5.60 on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. For upper deck, $5 on Mondays to Fridays; $6.50 on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.
*Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui for $5 on Mondays to Fridays; $6.50 on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays.

Passengers may use Octopus or tokens (Jeton) to pay for the ride. Tokens are available in the vending machines at the piers. Direct payment by coins at turnstile is no longer accepted.

The Tsim Sha Tsui – Central route does not accept cycles, but the Tsim Sha Tsui – Wan Chai route accepts cycles for an extra charge of $14, except during the evening peak hour from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

*Tsim Sha Tsui to Hong Kong Disneyland.
Star Ferry has announced plans to provide sightseeing service between Tsim Sha Tsui and Disneyland Resort Pier, which has been empty since its opening. This route consists of two departures and the round trip fare is $180. Passengers can enjoy views of Tsing Ma Bridge during the 45-minute journey on the luxury ferry World Star.

===Former===
*Central to Hung Hom for $6.30, terminated effective 1 April 2011.
*Wan Chai to Hung Hom for $6.30, terminated effective 1 April 2011.

===Charter and hire===
The Star Ferry &quot;Golden Star&#x27; is available for daily charter, for up to 300 people, having been refurbished for cruises and functions, with tables, larger sightseeing windows, an air-conditioned area, and a public address and music system.

==Fleet==
There are currently 9 diesel-electric ferries in the fleet, together with a tug.

Over the years, the fleet has included:

==Piers==
* Star Ferry Pier, Central at Central District
** First Generation (1890) Pedder Street and Chater Road
** Second Generation (1912) at Pedder Street, the present site of Jardine House
** Third Generation (1957) near Edinburgh Place
** Fourth Generation (2006) at Man Kwong Street
*** Piers 7 and 8 of Central Ferry Piers until 2011. Pier 7 served Tsim Sha Tsui, while Pier 8 served Hung Hom
*** Piers 7 of Central Ferry Piers since 2011. Pier 8 was converted into a museum in 2013.
* Star Ferry Pier at Tsim Sha Tsui (1957)
* Wan Chai Pier
** Second Generation (1968), closed effective 29 August 2014.
** Third Generation (2014), in service since 30 August 2014.
* Hung Hom Ferry Pier, service terminated effective 1 April 2011.

==Financial problems==
Since the Central Star Ferry Pier was moved from its old pier next to City Hall to the new location outside International Finance Centre, passenger numbers have fallen drastically to mainly tourists and a small number of commuters. This has meant the Star Ferry company has lost many millions of dollars since the relocation. Therefore, it decided not to re-tender for the loss-making Hung Hom-Central and Hung Hom-Wan Chai routes and stopped operating these routes and the relevant piers at Hung Hom Ferry Pier on 31 March 2011.

== Filmography ==
The Star Ferry appears in the 1960 film &quot;The World of Suzie Wong&quot;. In the beginning of the film, Robert Lomax (played by William Holden) disembarks from the SS &quot;President Wilson&quot; (an old American President Lines transpacific passenger vessel) and takes the Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island, and on the ferry meets Suzie Wong (played by Nancy Kwan), who scorns his attentions.

Several brief scenes in the 1988 TV miniseries &quot;Noble House&quot; are set aboard the ferry. It also appears in the French films &quot;Les Anges gardiens&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Moustache&quot; (2005).

<text>Adyar is a large neighbourhood in south Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is among the most upscale neighborhoods in Chennai.

It is located on the southern banks of the Adyar River. It is surrounded by the Tharamani in the West, Thiruvanmiyur to the South, Besant Nagar in the East, Kotturpuram in the North-West and Raja Annamalai puram in the North past the Adyar River. Adyar is one of the costliest areas in Chennai with property values four times the value of similar sized properties in the northern part of Chennai. The Gandhi Nagar region of Adyar is one of the poshest localities in Chennai.

==History==
===Etymology===
The neighbourhood gets its name from the Adyar River, which flows through its northern limits. The term &quot;Adyar&quot; is the anglicized form of the Tamil word &quot;aḍai-ārŭ&quot; ( &quot;clogged-river&quot;), which is colloquially just pronounced as &quot;aḍayār&quot;.

Adyar started to grow rapidly at the turn of the 20th century following the founding of the headquarters of the Theosophical Society by Mrs. Helena Blavatsky here in 1883. Following the establishment of the Theosophical Society headquarters, the Kalakshetra, a cultural organisation to promote traditional arts and culture was established by Rukmini Devi Arundale at Adyar in 1936. The 1931 census records Adyar as a &quot;zamindari&quot; village in Kancheepuram district. Adyar was included within the Chennai Corporation limits in 1948.

<text>Kumari, Kumari Devi, or the Living Goddess is the tradition of worshipping a chosen virgin as manifestations of the divine female energy or Shakti in Dharmic Nepali religious traditions. It is believed that the girl is possessed by the goddess Taleju or Durga. The word &quot;Kumari&quot; is derived from Sanskrit meaning princess. The procession is akin to Indra or Sakra, taking Indrani to his celestial abode as his bride. The festival is celebrated during Kumari Jatra, which follows the Indra Jatra religious ceremony. 

In Nepal, a Kumari is a prepubescent girl selected from the Shakya clan of the Nepali Newari Buddhist community. The Kumari is also revered and worshipped by some of the country&#x27;s Hindus. While there are several Kumaris throughout Nepal, with some cities having several, the best known is the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu, and she lives in the Kumari Ghar, a palace in the center of the city. The selection process for her is especially rigorous. As of 2023, the Royal Kumari of Kathmandu is Trishna Shakya, aged five, installed in September 2017. Unika Bajracharya, selected in April 2014 as the Kumari of Patan, is the second most important living goddess.

In Kathmandu Valley, this is a particularly prevalent practice. It is believed to be the incarnation of Taleju, a manifestation of the goddess Durga. When her first menstruation begins, it is believed that the deity vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury also causes loss of deity.

The Kumari tradition is only followed in a few cities in Nepal, which are Kathmandu, Lalitpur (also called Patan), Bhaktapur, Sankhu, and Bungamati. The selection process and roles of the Kumari vary between the different towns.

==Philosophy and scriptures==
The worship of the goddess in a young girl represents the worship of divine consciousness spread all over the creation. As the supreme goddess is thought to have manifested this entire cosmos out of her womb, she exists equally in animate as well as inanimate objects. While worship of an idol represents the worship and recognition of supreme through inanimate materials, worship of a human represents veneration and recognition of the same supreme in conscious beings.

In the Shakta text &quot;Devi Mahatmyam&quot;, or &quot;Chandi&quot;, the goddess is said to have declared that she resides in all female living beings in this universe. The entire ritual of Kumari is based on this verse. But while worshipping a goddess, only a young girl is chosen over a mature woman because of their inherent purity and chastity.

Hindu scriptures, such as the &quot;Jñanarnava Rudrayamala&quot; tantra, assign names to a Kumari depending on her age:

In Nepal, Kumaris are worshiped only for a day; these names are assigned only while the ritual lasts, often a few hours. Usually one cannot be a Kumari beyond 16 years of age because of menarche. In Bungamati, the Kumari reigns until her first milk tooth falls out.

The main target of a Kumari puja is to realize the potential divinity in every human being, mostly female. A Hindu spiritual aspirant sees the universal consciousness of humanity.

==History in Nepal==
Whilst the veneration of a living Kumari in Nepal is relatively recent, dating only from the 17th century, the tradition of Kumari-Puja, or virgin worship, has been around for much longer. There is evidence of virgin worship taking place in Nepal for more than 2,300 years. It appears to have taken hold in Nepal in the 6th century. There is written evidence describing the selection, ornamentation, and worship of the Kumari dating from the 13th century CE.

There are several legends telling how the current tradition of the Kumari began. Most of the legends, however, involve the tale of King Jayaprakash Malla, the last Nepalese king of the Malla Dynasty (12th–17th century CE). According to the most popular legend, a king and his friend, the goddess Taleju, approached his chambers late one night as he played tripasa, a dice game. The goddess came along every night to play the game with the condition that the king refrains from telling anyone about their meetings.

One night, the king&#x27;s wife followed him to his chamber in order to find out who the king was meeting so often. The king&#x27;s wife saw Taleju, and the goddess was angered. She told the king that if he wanted to see her again or have her protect his country, he would have to search for her among the Newari (Shakya) community of Ratnawali, as she would be incarnated as a little girl among them. Hoping to make amends with his patroness, King Jayaprakash Malla left the palace in search of the young girl who was possessed by Taleju.

Similarly, there is another story about the disappearance of Taleju. Some believe that the goddess visited King Trailokya Malla every night in the human form. Like other legendary stories, the king and the goddess played tripasa (dice) while discussing the welfare of the country. However, one night, King Trailokya Malla made sexual advances towards the goddess Taleju. As a result, the goddess in rage stopped visiting the palace. The king in regret worshiped and pleaded for her return. Finally, the goddess agreed to appear in the body of a virgin girl from the Shakya family.

Even today, a mother&#x27;s dream of a red serpent is believed to be a portent of the elevation of her daughter to the position of Royal Kumari. And each year, the Nepalese King seeks the blessing of the Royal Kumari at the festival of Indra Jatra. This tradition has changed from 2008 A.D. with the country becoming one of the youngest republics in the world. 

A variation of this and other legends names King Gunkam Dev, a 12th-century ancestor of King Jayaprakash Malla, as the main character rather than Jayaprakash Malla.

A third variation of the legend says that during the reign of King Jayaprakash Malla, a young girl was banished from the city because it was feared that she was possessed by the goddess Durga. When the queen learned of the young girl&#x27;s fate, she became enraged and insisted that the king fetch the girl and install her as the living incarnation of Durga.

==Selection process==

Once Taleju has left the sitting Kumari, there is a frenzy of activity to find her successor. During the period of monarchy, the selection process was conducted by five senior Buddhist Vajracharya priests, the Panch Buddha, the Bada Guruju or Chief Royal Priest, Achajau, the priest of Taleju and the royal astrologer. The king and other religious leaders that might know of eligible candidates were also to be informed of the commencement of the selection. Today, representatives of the President and Vice President, as well as the Federal Parliament and Cabinet, are also given word on the succession, alongside a few of the religious dignitaries mentioned and others.

Eligible girls are from the Newar Shakya caste of silver and goldsmiths. She must be in excellent health, never have shed blood or been afflicted by any diseases, be without blemish, and must not have yet lost any teeth. Girls who pass these basic eligibility requirements are examined for the &quot;battis lakshanas&quot;, or &quot;thirty-two perfections&quot; of a goddess. Some of these are poetically listed as such:

* A neck like a conch shell
* A body like a banyan tree
* Eyelashes like a cow
* Thighs like a deer
* Chest like a lion
* Voice as soft and clear as a duck&#x27;s

In addition to this, her hair and eyes should be very &quot;black&quot;, and she should have dainty hands and feet, small and well-recessed sexual organs, and a set of twenty teeth.

During the royal period, any girl candidate for the title was also observed for signs of serenity and fearlessness, and her horoscope is examined to ensure that it is complementary to the king&#x27;s. It was important that there not be any conflicts, as she must confirm the king&#x27;s legitimacy each year of her divinity. Her family was also to be scrutinized to ensure its piety and devotion to the king.

Once the priests have chosen a candidate, she must undergo yet more rigorous tests to ensure that she indeed possesses the qualities necessary to be the living vessel of Durga. Her greatest test comes during the Hindu festival of Dashain, also known as Vijaya Dashami. On the Kalaratri, or &quot;black night&quot;, 108 buffaloes and goats are sacrificed to the goddess Kali. The young candidate is taken into the Taleju temple and released into the courtyard, where the severed heads of the animals are illuminated by candlelight and masked men are dancing about. If the candidate truly possesses the qualities of Taleju, she shows no fear during this experience. If she does, another candidate is brought in to attempt the same thing.

In the next test, the living goddess must spend a night alone in a room among the heads of ritually slaughtered goats and buffaloes without showing fear. The fearless candidate has proven that she has the serenity and the fearlessness that typifies the goddess who is to inhabit her. After passing all other tests, the final test is that she must be able to pick out the personal belongings of the previous Kumari from an assortment of things laid out before her. If she is able to do so, there is no remaining doubt that she is the chosen one.

There are claims contrary to the commonly believed ritual and screening process, however. The ex-Royal Kumari Rashmila Shakya states in her autobiography, &quot;From Goddess to Mortal&quot;, that this has nothing to do with the selection process, but rather is a ritual the Royal Kumari goes through each year, that there are no men dancing around in masks trying to scare her, and that at most, there are only a dozen or so decapitated animal heads in the scary room test. She also describes the requisite physical examination of each Kumari as neither intimate nor rigorous.

Once the Kumari is chosen, she must be purified so that she can be an unblemished vessel for Taleju. She is taken by the priests to undergo a number of secret Tantric rituals to cleanse her body and spirit of her past experiences. Once these rituals are completed, Taleju enters her, and she is presented as the new Kumari. She is dressed and made up as a Kumari and then leaves the Taleju temple and walks across the square on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar, which will be her home for the duration of her divinity.

==Life of the Royal Kumari==

Once the chosen girl completes the Tantric purification rites and crosses from the temple on a white cloth to the Kumari Ghar to assume her throne, her life takes on an entirely new character. She will leave her palace only on ceremonial occasions. Her family will visit her rarely, and then only in a formal capacity. Her playmates will be drawn from a narrow pool of Newari children from her caste, usually the children of her caretakers. She will always be dressed in red and gold, wear her hair in a topknot, and have the &quot;agni chakshu&quot;, or &quot;fire eye&quot;, painted on her forehead as a symbol of her special powers of perception.

The Royal Kumari&#x27;s new life is vastly different from the one to which she has been accustomed to. Whilst her life is now free of material troubles, she has ceremonial duties to carry out. Although she is not ordered about, she is expected to behave as befits a goddess. She has shown the correct qualities during the selection process, and her continued serenity is of paramount importance; an ill-tempered goddess is believed to portend bad tidings for those petitioning her.

The Kumari&#x27;s walk across the Durbar Square is the last time her feet will touch the ground until such time as the goddess departs from her body. From now on, when she ventures outside of her palace, she will be carried or transported in her golden palanquin. Her feet, like all of her, are now sacred. Petitioners will touch them, hoping to receive respite from troubles and illnesses. The king himself will kiss them each year when he comes to seek her blessing. She will never wear shoes; if her feet are covered at all, they will be covered with red stockings.

The power of the Kumari is perceived to be so strong that even a glimpse of her is believed to bring good fortune. Crowds of people wait below the Kumari&#x27;s window in the Kumari Chowk, or courtyard, of her palace, hoping that she will pass by the latticed windows on the third floor and glance down at them. Even though her irregular appearances last only a few seconds, the atmosphere in the courtyard is charged with devotion and awe when they do occur.

The more fortunate, or better connected, petitioners visit the Kumari in her chambers, where she sits upon a gilded lion throne. Many of those visiting her are people suffering from blood or menstrual disorders since the Kumari is believed to have special power over such illnesses. She is also visited by bureaucrats and other government officials. Petitioners customarily bring gifts and food offerings to the Kumari, who receives them in silence. Upon arrival, she offers them her feet to touch or kiss as an act of devotion. During these audiences, the Kumari is closely watched, and her actions interpreted as a prediction of the petitioners&#x27; lives, as follows:

* Crying or loud laughter: Serious illness or death
* Weeping or rubbing eyes: Imminent death
* Trembling: Imprisonment
* Hand clapping: Reason to fear the king
* Picking at food offerings: Financial losses

If the Kumari remains silent and impassive throughout the audience, her devotees leave elated. This is the sign that their wishes have been granted.

Many people attend to the Kumari&#x27;s needs. These people are known as the Kumarimi and are headed by the patron. Their job is very difficult. They must attend to the Kumari&#x27;s every need and desire while giving her instruction in her ceremonial duties. While they cannot directly order her to do anything, they must guide her through her life. They are responsible for bathing her, dressing her, and attending to her makeup, as well as preparing her for her visitors and for ceremonial occasions.

Traditionally, the Kumari received no education, as she was widely considered to be omniscient. However, modernization has made it necessary for her to have an education once she re-enters mortal life. Kumaris are now allowed to attend public schools and have a life inside the classroom that is no different from that of other students. While many kumaris, such as the Kumari of Bhaktapur, attend school, others, such as the main kumari in Kathmandu, receive their education through private tutors.

Similarly, her limited playmates must learn to respect her. Since her every wish must be granted, they must learn to surrender to her whatever they have that she may want and to defer to her wishes in what games to play or activities to play.

==List of Kumaris==



==Controversy==
On 3 July 2008, Sajani Shakya was removed from her position as Kumari of Bhaktapur after visiting the United States to attend the release of the movie &quot;Living Goddess&quot; at Silverdocs, the American Film Institute/Discovery Channel documentary festival in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland. The visit, according to the elders, had tainted her purity. A couple of weeks later, temple authorities at Sajani Shakya&#x27;s hometown recanted their previous statement and said that she would not be stripped of her title because she was willing to undergo a &quot;cleansing&quot; ceremony to remove any sins she might have committed while traveling.

==Popular culture==
* The Kumari was featured in the 25 October 2015 episode of the CBS drama series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; (season 2, episode 4), titled &quot;Waiting for Taleju&quot;. In the episode, fictional US Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord meets with the Kumari in hopes of gaining support for a deal that will help secure US disaster relief funds in the wake of the April 2015 Nepal earthquake.

* In the Korean webtoon series &quot;For the Sake of Sita&quot;, the female lead character was a Kumari in Nepal.

* In the novel &quot;The Lives of Christopher Chant&quot; by Diana Wynne Jones, the character of the Living Asheth is a little girl worshipped as a goddess in one of the worlds visited by the main character and is based heavily on the Kumari, being the incarnation of a goddess and having to live by strict rules of ritual purity.

* In the Netflix limited series &quot;The Serpent&quot; episode 4, Monique sees a Kumari girl from outside of the temple.
* In the 2016 Indian film &quot;Kaashmora&quot;, The reincarnation of Rathna Mahadevi (Nayanthara&#x27;s character), is portrayed as a girl dressed like a Kumari.
* In the game &quot;Far Cry 4&quot;, there is a myth known as Tarun Matara, which is heavily inspired by this tradition.

<text>Trần Lệ Xuân (; 22 August 1924 – 24 April 2011), more popularly known in English as Madame Nhu, was the &quot;de facto&quot; First Lady of South Vietnam from 1955 to 1963. She was the wife of Ngô Đình Nhu, who was the brother and chief advisor to President Ngô Đình Diệm. As Diệm was a lifelong bachelor and because she and her family lived in Independence Palace together with him, she was considered to be the first lady.

Known for her incendiary comments that attacked and severely denounced the Buddhist community of South Vietnam and the strong U.S. influence and presence in the country, she went to live in exile in France after her husband, Nhu, and her brother-in-law, Diệm, were assassinated in 1963.

==Early years==
Trần Lệ Xuân, whose given name means &quot;Spring&#x27;s Beauty,&quot; was born in 1924 into a wealthy aristocratic family in Hanoi, French Indochina, then part of the French colonial empire. Her paternal grandfather was close to the French colonial administration, while her father, Trần Văn Chương, studied law in France and practiced in Bac Lieu in the Mekong Delta before marrying into the ruling imperial dynasty. Her father also served as the first foreign secretary for Indochina under Japanese occupation. Her mother, Thân Thị Nam Trân, was a granddaughter of Emperor Đồng Khánh and a cousin of Emperor Bảo Đại. The Trầns were under observation by the French police who doubted their loyalty to France, with M. Chương dismissed as a &quot;little runt&quot; controlled by his wife, while Madame Chương, described as &quot;beautiful and very intriguing...the one who directs her husband,&quot; was known for &quot;her dogged ambition as for her —sleeping around with people of influence from any and all nationalities.&quot; Madame Chuong was accused by the French secret police (French Sûreté) of sleeping with Japanese diplomats so her husband was hired by them.
Lệ Xuân&#x27;s education at the Lycée Albert Sarraut, a prestigious French school in Hanoi, was entirely in French, and she remembered as a schoolgirl learning about French history but nothing about Vietnamese history, and of singing songs about the forests and mountains of France, observing later the purpose of her education was to eradicate any sense of a Vietnamese identity, and to make her into a proper young Frenchwoman. The purpose of French educational policies in Vietnam was always in reference to France&#x27;s self-proclaimed (&quot;civilizing mission&quot;) to make all Vietnamese into &quot;Frenchmen with yellow skin,&quot; and thus French teachers tried to stamp out any sense of a Vietnamese identity in their students. The message French teachers taught their students was that to be French was to be &quot;civilized&quot; and to be Vietnamese was to be &quot;uncivilized.&quot; She then dropped out of Lycée Albert Sarraut. She spoke French at home and could not write in Vietnamese; as an adult, she drafted her speeches in French and had them translated into Vietnamese. She gained a reputation in her youth as a tomboy who loved ballet and piano, once dancing solo at Hanoi&#x27;s National Theatre. She had an elder sister named Trần Lệ Chi (who married the Frenchman Etienne Oggeri and changed her name to Lechi Oggeri) and a younger brother, Trần Văn Khiêm. Like many other Vietnamese, Lệ Xuân was to find that no matter how hard she tried to be French, that the French were only prepared to accept whites as French.

When she became an adult, her mother introduced her to a series of eligible young men, but she insisted on Nhu. He was fourteen years her senior and referred to her as &quot;little niece&quot; in accordance with Vietnamese custom. In accordance with Vietnamese tradition, they were married three years after being betrothed in 1940. In May 1943, aged 18, she married Nhu, and converted from Mahayana Buddhism to Roman Catholicism, her husband&#x27;s religion. Madame Nhu later admitted she married Nhu as a way of getting away from her family, saying &quot;I never had a sweeping love. I read about such things in books, but I do not believe that they really existed. Or perhaps only for a very few people&quot;. After an uprising by the Viet Minh in August 1945, her brother-in-law, Ngô Đình Khôi, the eldest of the Ngô brothers, was buried alive, and Nhu and another brother, Ngô Đình Cẩn, were forced to flee. 

She, her mother-in-law and her eldest daughter, at the time a baby, were captured. Thinking her piano was a radio for communicating with French colonialists, the Viet Minh blew it up and then exiled her to a remote village for four months, where she lived on two bowls of rice a day. The French dismissed Nhu from his post at the National Library due to his brother (Diệm)&#x27;s nationalist activities, and he moved to Đà Lạt and lived comfortably, editing a newspaper, where his wife bore three more children. The French war in Vietnam made little impression on Madame Nhu from her home in Đà Lạt, and she often called the war (&quot;a bizarre little war&quot;) as the fighting never affected her personally. Nhu was during these years building a secret political party called the Cần Lao (Personalist Labour Party) based on the Catholic philosophy of personalism (people were persons, not individuals) while Madame Nhu later saying &quot;I was alone most of the time. My husband would simply disappear without a word&quot;. To improve her husband&#x27;s career, Madame Nhu befriended her cousin, the Emperor Bảo Đại during this time.

==Rise to power==

Madame Nhu&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ngô Đình Diệm, had been appointed Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by her mother&#x27;s distant cousin, Emperor Bảo Đại, after the French had been defeated at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ. At the start of 1955, French Indochina was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south. After the French defeat at the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ, the French wanted to hang on to a zone of influence in the south by keeping the Emperor Bảo Đại as Head of State, while the Americans wanted to push the French out by having Diệm create a republic. Diệm in the words of an American diplomat had developed &quot;a blind hatred of the French&quot; and the Americans believed that South Vietnam needed an anti-Communist leader who was not tainted with any associations with the French, which led them to back Diệm. Madame Nhu had lobbied Bảo Đại to appoint her brother-in-law Prime Minister and believed that it was her influence that led to the appointment. She was deeply shocked to learn the real reason why Bảo Đại had appointed Diệm Prime Minister was out of the expectation that he would fail, thereby curtailing his career. The State of Vietnam was in a serious political and economic crisis by 1954 that almost nobody expected Diệm to navigate effectively. Nhu never forgave the Emperor and the French for this plot to ruin Diệm.

In order to ensure American support for Diệm, Madame Nhu befriended Americans working at the embassy in Saigon known to be CIA agents. For their part, the French backed General Nguyễn Văn Hinh as Prime Minister, and he in turn had won the support of the Bình Xuyên crime syndicate that dominated the economic life of Saigon. Giving Madame Nhu an additional reason to intrigue against Hinh was his repeated boasting that when he deposed Diệm he would make Madame Nhu into another of his concubines. At a party, Madame Nhu confronted Hinh to tell him: &quot;You are never going to overthrow this government because you don&#x27;t have the guts. And if you do overthrow the government, you will never have me because I will claw your throat out first!&quot;

To win support for Diệm, Madame Nhu hit upon the idea of enlisting support from the million or so refugees from North Vietnam, many of them Catholics who fled to the south after the Geneva accords had partitioned Vietnam, organizing them for a massive pro-Diệm demonstration on 21 September 1954. The rally in Saigon led to a confrontation on the streets between Madame Nhu and Bình Xuyên gunmen, with Madame Nhu daring the thugs to kill her right then and there, which caused them to demur, and the rally went on. Emboldened by this triumph, Diệm saw a chance to put his puritanical Roman Catholic values into practice and to strike a blow at the Bình Xuyên at the same time by shutting down the brothels, gambling houses and opium dens of Saigon owned by the Bình Xuyên while having pornographic magazines burned on the streets (the Bình Xuyên were the largest producers and sellers of pornography in Vietnam).

A referendum was scheduled for 23 October 1955, to determine the future direction of the south. It was contested by Bảo Đại, the Emperor, advocating the restoration of the monarchy, while Diệm ran on a republican platform. The elections were held, with Nhu and the family&#x27;s Cần Lao Party, which supplied Diệm&#x27;s electoral base, organising and supervising the elections. Campaigning for Emperor Bảo Đại was prohibited, and the result was rigged, with Bảo Đại&#x27;s supporters attacked by Nhu&#x27;s paid thugs. Diệm claimed 98.2% of the vote, including 605,025 votes in Saigon, where only 450,000 voters were registered. Diệm&#x27;s tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. As a result, Diệm eliminated the Emperor Bảo Đại and became the first president of South Vietnam. Madame Nhu made no secret of her dislike for the Emperor Bảo Đại, calling him &quot;that French puppet&quot;.

==Post-elections==
After the election, the couple moved into the Presidential Palace. Madame Nhu was influential on government policy and, since her brother-in-law, Ngô Đình Diệm, was unmarried, she was regarded as the First Lady of South Vietnam. She attempted to syncretize Roman Catholicism with a cult around herself as a modern reincarnation of Vietnam&#x27;s fabled Trưng Sisters, who raised a revolt against China and temporarily defeated the Hán dynasty Chinese troops in AD 40. President Diệm never married and is not known to have had a relationship with any women, though his bodyguard noted he was fond of keeping &quot;good looking men around him&quot;. Diệm, who was known for his poor social skills, decided to have his sister-in-law serve as the unofficial First Lady of South Vietnam. Madame Nhu frequently talked to the Vietnamese, French and other foreign press quite candidly. Madame Nhu&#x27;s marriage was unhappy as she wrote in her diary of an all consuming &quot;rising desire&quot; in her body, complained her husband had little interest in sex with her, and wrote with disgust of his affections for a younger woman whom she called that &quot;creature&quot; who was very &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;dirty&quot;. Madame Nhu devoted her time to politics, championing a new Family Code she presented to parliament in October 1957 and passed in June 1958 to replace the old French code that banned concubinage and polygamy; allowed women to open bank accounts and own property; and required that daughters be given greater inheritance rights.

In 1962, she had a statue erected in Saigon to the memory of the Trưng Sisters, with the facial features modelled on herself, and also established the Women&#x27;s Solidarity Movement, a female paramilitary organization. The statue cost US$20,000, a substantial sum at the time, given that South Vietnam was a developing country, but she was undeterred by criticism about largesse. She pressured the wives of ARVN officers and public servants into joining her &quot;movement&quot;. A flamboyant woman, Madame Nhu took to flashing around her handgun in public, and the Women&#x27;s Solidarity Movement was intended to allow Vietnamese women to participate in the fight against the Viet Cong, just as the Trưng sisters had fought against the Chinese, but most of the women who joined the movement were upper-class women who believed that their husbands would benefit by being given government jobs.

Her father became the ambassador to the United States while her mother was South Vietnam&#x27;s observer at the United Nations. Two of her uncles were cabinet ministers.

Her parents resigned from their posts in 1963, in protest over the treatment of Buddhists under the regime of President Diệm and disowned their daughter.

Howard Jones says &quot;Madame Nhu was chauffeured in a black Mercedes and wore a small diamond crucifix&quot;, and &quot;wore form-fitting apparel so tight that one French correspondent suggestively described her as &#x27;molded into her ... dress like a dagger in its sheath.&#x27; On formal occasions, she wore red satin pantaloons with three vertical pleats, which was the mark of the highest-ranking women of the imperial court in ancient Annam.&quot; When Diệm once criticized her collarless apparel, she snapped: &quot;It&#x27;s not your neck that sticks out, it&#x27;s mine. So, shut up.&quot;

==Advocacy==
During her brother-in-law&#x27;s presidency, Madame Nhu pushed for the passing of &quot;morality laws&quot; outlawing abortion, adultery, divorce, contraceptives, dance halls, beauty pageants, boxing matches, and animal fighting, and closed down the brothels and opium dens. She was widely mocked by the public who regarded her as a hypocrite, with older Vietnamese believing her &quot;décolleté&quot; gowns to be sexually suggestive. In Vietnam&#x27;s Confucian culture, overt displays of sexuality are considered inappropriate. Her family received further scorn as her sister Trần Lệ Chi, who was married to Nguyễn Hữu Châu, had a French lover named Etienne Oggeri, and critics alleged that Madame Nhu introduced the &quot;morality laws&quot; so that her sister&#x27;s husband could not get a divorce. Since he was extremely wealthy, the Ngô family would have lost highly valuable assets. In addition, her brother, Khiêm, used his government connections to rich entrepreneurs. Diệm had stated before becoming president, &quot;The history of China bears witness to the grave crises brought on by the empresses and their relatives.&quot; The Diệm regime tended to favor giving high positions to Roman Catholics, which alienated the Buddhist majority over time.

Madame Nhu exerted influence with her fiery attitude, often abusing Diệm and Nhu, who bowed to her angry tirades. Madame Nhu was frequently mocked by the media for her ostentatious flaunting of power, and was sometimes called the &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;, as well as &quot;Lucretia Borgia&quot; and &quot;The Queen Bee&quot;. She once stated &quot;Power is wonderful. Total power is totally wonderful.&quot; In Vietnam, Madame Nhu was called the Tiger Lady as dragons are considered lucky and benevolent (mythical) animals in Vietnamese culture that are the wise and kindly friends of humanity, whereas the tiger is considered a symbol of ferocity, and many Vietnamese found the term &quot;Dragon Lady&quot; mystifying and insulting. She once told a group of American congressmen, &quot;I&#x27;m not exactly afraid of death. I love power and in the next life I have a chance to be even more powerful than I am.&quot; U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara noted that &quot;I saw Madame Nhu as bright, forceful, and beautiful, but also diabolical and scheming—a true sorceress.&quot;

She had a message to Diệm&#x27;s opponents: &quot;We will track down, neutralize and all these scabby sheep.&quot; French journalist François Sully wrote that Madame Nhu was &quot;conceited, and obsessed with a drive for power that far surpasses that of even her husband ... It is no exaggeration to say that Madame Nhu is the most detested personality in South Vietnam.&quot; Sully was promptly expelled from Vietnam by the Ngô family.

Madame Nhu claimed that she and her husband were responsible for Diệm&#x27;s triumph over the Bình Xuyên in the Battle for Saigon in 1954. She claimed it was the family&#x27;s destiny to save South Vietnam. Following the collapse of the coup, her influence in the family began to rise.

As her husband&#x27;s influence grew, as did her own vicariously, so did American distaste for them. Wesley Fishel, the anti-Communist academic from Michigan State University who had led an advisory group that helped to train Vietnamese public servants and who had lobbied American politicians in the 1950s to support Diệm&#x27;s bid for power, resigned along with his staff. Fishel called Madame Nhu &quot;Brilliant, vivacious, bitchy and brutal in her Borgia-like fashion&quot;, claiming that she and her husband were evil influences corrupting the regime.

She often exerted her influence through bouts of shouting. Sometimes when she disagreed with a proposal or decision that had been made inside the palace by some ministers or other senior public servants, she would verbally abuse them and intimidate them into adopting her preferred stance.

On 27 February 1962, two dissident Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots, Nguyễn Văn Cử and Phạm Phú Quốc, bombed the Independence Palace, the official residence of the Ngô family, with the aim of assassinating them. One bomb landed in a room where Diệm was reading, but failed to detonate. The family escaped to the cellar unhurt, except for Madame Nhu, who sustained an arm fracture while running for cover.

Diệm reacted to the bombing by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Madame Nhu added, &quot;[y]ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don&#x27;t want to be exploited by it.&quot; In a radio interview in late 1962, she mockingly remarked that American journalists were &quot;intoxicated with communism&quot;.

The following year she instructed her Women&#x27;s Solidarity Movement to oppose American attempts &quot;to make lackeys of Vietnamese and to seduce Vietnamese women into decadent paths.&quot; As relations became strained, she publicly accused the Americans of having supported the 1960 coup.

==Buddhist crisis==
On 8 May 1963, a series of celebrations were held by Buddhist priests all over South Vietnam to honor Buddhist holiday of Vesak, as 8 May was the 2,527th anniversary of the Buddha&#x27;s birthday. The Catholic Diệm disapproved of Vesak, and ordered the police to put down the celebrations under a law which forbade religious symbols from being paraded in the streets. A series of clashes occurred all over South Vietnam as the police sought to end the marches. When she heard that Diệm was to sign a statement offering compensation to the families of Buddhist protesters shot dead by the police of his brother Ngô Đình Cẩn, Nhu was reported to have thrown a bowl of soup at him. On 8 June 1963, Madame Nhu released a statement through the Women&#x27;s Solidarity Movement accusing the Buddhists of neutralism, effectively accusing them of being communist collaborators. It then implored &quot;bonzes of good faith&quot; to stop helping the communists, otherwise Vietnamese Buddhism would be seen as a &quot;small anti-nationalist branch of a dubious international association, exploited and controlled by communism and oriented to the sowing of the disorder of neutralism&quot;. She made another attack on the United States, calling on Diệm to &quot;keep vigilance on all others, particularly those inclined to take Viet Nam for [a] satellite of [a] foreign power or organization.&quot; Madame Nhu publicly mocked Thích Quảng Đức, who performed a self-immolation on 11 June 1963 in a crowded Saigon street to protest against the shooting of Buddhists by Diệm&#x27;s regime. She labelled it a &quot;barbecue&quot; and stated, &quot;Let them burn and we shall clap our hands.&quot; She further offered to provide more fuel and matches for the Buddhists, noting the &quot;barbecuing&quot; was not &quot;self-sufficient&quot; because &quot;imported gasoline&quot; was used. The monk&#x27;s suicide followed Ngô Đình Nhu&#x27;s repression of the Buddhist-inspired protests and was responsible for the regime&#x27;s continuing instability. According to historian Howard Jones, these comments &quot;all but put the finishing touch on the Diệm regime&quot;.

Her own father went on radio to condemn her comments. A Confucian, Chương said that the regime had alienated &quot;the strongest moral forces&quot;, implying that they had lost the Mandate of Heaven. She responded by calling him a &quot;coward&quot;. Her mother said that &quot;There is an old proverb in my country which means &#x27;one should not make oneself or one&#x27;s family naked before the world&#x27;... I was sick... Now, nobody can stop her ... She never listened to our advice.&quot; After these comments, the U.S. ambassador, Frederick Nolting, told Diệm that if he did not denounce his sister-in-law&#x27;s comment in public, the U.S. would have to stop supporting him, but the president refused to do so, and assailed the monks. In an interview with David Halberstam, Madame Nhu said that it was &quot;embarrassing to see people [Buddhist leaders] so uncultured claiming to be leaders&quot;. The U.S. embassy told Diệm that these comments violated an agreement between the Buddhists and his regime to avoid verbal exchanges, but Diệm refused to keep his family&#x27;s end of the bargain, saying that his sister-in-law was obliged to expose &quot;extremists&quot; to keep the public informed. In July, the U.S. government rejected a request from her to travel to the United States for a public speaking tour, fearing a public relations disaster. On 3 August, she called the Buddhists &quot;seditious elements who use the most odious Communist tactics to subvert the country.&quot;

This occurred after special forces loyal to the Ngôs raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda in Saigon in August. The pagoda was vandalized, monks beaten, and the cremated remains of Thích Quảng Đức, which included a heart which had not disintegrated, were confiscated. Simultaneous raids were carried out across the country, with the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế being looted, the statue of Gautama Buddha demolished, and the body of a deceased monk stolen. When the populace came to the defense of the monks, the resulting clashes saw 30 civilians killed and 200 wounded. Notably, President Diệm sent his sister-in-law a letter asking her not to talk in public about the clashes as her &quot;barbecue&quot; remarks had been a public relations disaster for his regime, both at home and abroad. Through her paramilitary organization, Madame Nhu claimed that the Buddhists were &quot;controlled by communism&quot; and that they were manipulated by the Americans, calling on Diệm to &quot;expel all foreign agitators whether they wear monks&#x27; robes or not&quot;. A few days after the raids, Madame Nhu described the deadly attacks on the Buddhists as &quot;the happiest day in my life since we crushed the Bình Xuyên in 1955&quot;, and assailed them as &quot;communists&quot;.

The United States, in a position of some leverage owing to the considerable U.S. aid flowing into South Vietnam, in August 1963 wished to give President Diệm a chance to rid himself of both his brother and Madame Nhu. In a cable drafted by Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Roger Hilsman, to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Lodge was instructed to advise Diệm of a call for &quot;the removal of the Nhus from the scene.&quot; U.S. President Kennedy supported the message in the cable upon its approval by most of his advisors.

Her comments further stoked open infighting with her parents, who would eventually disown her and seek refuge in the United States. Her father, Trần Văn Chương, the ambassador to the United States, resigned in protest, along with all but one of the staffers at the embassy. Chương charged Diệm with having &quot;copied the tactics of totalitarian regimes&quot;. His wife, who was South Vietnam&#x27;s observer at the United Nations, resigned and spoke of mass executions and a reign of terror under Diệm and Nhu. She predicted that if Diệm, Nhu, and Madame Nhu did not leave Vietnam, then they would inevitably be killed. Madame Nhu claimed Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang &quot;spoke for many intellectuals who had repeatedly ridiculed her.&quot;

Following the pagoda raids, Trí Quang was given asylum at the U.S. Embassy after Ngô Đình Nhu&#x27;s plans to assassinate him were uncovered. Madame Nhu gave a media interview in which she called on government troops to invade the American embassy and capture Thích Trí Quang and some other monks who were staying there, saying that the government must arrest &quot;all key Buddhists&quot;. In a media interview, her husband responded to his parents-in-law by vowing to kill his father-in-law, claiming his wife would participate. He said &quot;I will have his head cut off. I will hang him in the center of a square and let him dangle there. My wife will make the knot on the rope because she is proud of being a Vietnamese and she is a good patriot.&quot;

==Visiting the United States==

When acting U.S. ambassador William Trueheart warned that development aid might be withheld if the repression orchestrated by the Ngôs continued, Madame Nhu denounced it as blackmail. Nhu and Diệm, fearing a cut in aid, sent Madame Nhu to the United States on a speaking tour. She departed South Vietnam on 9 September 1963 in an expedition that brought widespread international scorn to her family&#x27;s regime. She had predicted &quot;a triumphant lecture tour&quot;. She left on 17 September for the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Yugoslavia, followed by a trip to Italy and possibly to the United States, where she had an invitation to speak before the Overseas Press Club of New York.

Madame Nhu&#x27;s comments were such that President John F. Kennedy became personally concerned. He asked his advisers to find means of having Diệm gag her. McGeorge Bundy thought her comments were so damaging that it would only be acceptable for Ngô Đình Diệm to remain in power if she were out of the picture. The National Security Council deemed her a threat to U.S. security, and told the then United States Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to seek her permanent removal from South Vietnam.

There was also speculation that she could turn up at the United Nations in New York and embarrass South Vietnam and the U.S. Bundy said in a meeting that &quot;this was the first time the world had been faced with collective madness in a ruling family since the days of the czars&quot; and her comments provoked much debate on how to get Diệm to silence her.

In Madame Nhu&#x27;s first destination, Belgrade, she said in an interview that &quot;President Kennedy is a politician, and when he hears a loud opinion speaking in a certain way, he tries to appease it somehow&quot;, referring to the opposition to her family&#x27;s rule. She continued: &quot;if that opinion is misinformed, the solution is not to bow to it, but the solution should be to inform.&quot;

The issue resulted in an awkward confrontation when U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell Taylor, traveled to Vietnam for a fact-finding mission known as the McNamara–Taylor mission about the progress of the war. One of the purposes of the mission was to achieve, in the words of President Kennedy, &quot;a visible reduction in influence of Nhus, who are symbol to disaffected of all that they dislike in GVN [Government of (South) Vietnam]. This we think would require Nhus&#x27; departure from Saigon and preferably Vietnam at least for extended vacation.&quot;

On 29 September 1963 meeting with Diệm, McNamara bemoaned &quot;the ill-advised and unfortunate declarations of Madame Nhu&quot;, who had described U.S. military advisors as &quot;acting like little soldiers of fortune&quot;. McNamara said that such comments would damage bilateral military cooperation and deter American officers from helping the South Vietnamese forces. Lodge denounced the comments and said, &quot;These men should be thanked, not insulted.&quot; However, one of his aides lost his composure and asked if &quot;there were not something the government could do to shut her up.&quot; Diệm was stunned by the comments and retorted that &quot;one cannot deny a lady the right to defend herself when she has been unjustly attacked&quot;, saying his sister-in-law was entitled to freedom of speech. But McNamara reinforced the point, noting to Diệm that &quot;This is not satisfactory. The problems were real and serious. They had to be solved before the war could be won.&quot;

Madame Nhu arrived in the United States on 7 October, and her arrival was greeted by the United Nations&#x27; launching of an inquiry into the repression of Buddhists in South Vietnam. Kennedy had resisted the temptation to deny her an entry visa and his administration soon came under a flurry of verbal attacks.

Despite U.S. Vice President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s advice for her to stop damaging relations with inflammatory remarks, Madame Nhu refused to back down, describing herself as a scapegoat for American shortcomings and failures. She went on to accuse the administration of betraying her family, saying &quot;I refuse to play the role of an accomplice in an awful murder ... According to a few immature American junior officials—too imbued by a real but obsolete imperialist spirit, the Vietnamese regime is not puppet enough and must be liquidated.&quot; She accused the Americans of undermining South Vietnam through &quot;briberies, threats and other means&quot; to destroy her family because they &quot;do not like&quot; it. She further mocked Kennedy&#x27;s entourage, asking why &quot;all the people around President Kennedy are pink?&quot;

She denounced American liberals as &quot;worse than communists&quot; and Buddhists as &quot;hooligans in robes&quot;. Her father did not share the same beliefs and followed her around the country rebutting her comments, denouncing the &quot;injustice and oppression&quot; and stating that his daughter had &quot;become unwittingly the greatest asset to the communists.&quot; She predicted that Buddhism would become extinct in Vietnam. The Oram Group, the Madison Avenue PR firm that had been hired to promote Diệm&#x27;s image in the U.S. for $3,000 per month ended its relationship with Diệm during Madame Nhu&#x27;s visit under the grounds she had so badly damaged the image of the Diệm government in America that there was nothing that could be done to improve his image and a continued association was going to cost the Oram Group other clients. American journalists had discovered Madame Nhu was &quot;unfortunately too beautiful to ignore&quot; as a Kennedy administration staffer complained, and that it was easy to provoke her into saying something outrageous, causing a media circus to develop around her as she traveled across America.

In the wake of the tumultuous events, Madame Nhu appeared on NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on 13 October 1963, defending her actions and those of the South Vietnamese government. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as ours is in Vietnam. Americans talk about my husband and I leaving our native land permanently. Why should we do this? Where would we go? To say that 70 percent of my country&#x27;s population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood.&quot;

Upon the assassination of the Diệm brothers, President Kennedy&#x27;s feelings were expressed to close friend Paul &quot;Red&quot; Fay, Acting Secretary of the Navy. The circumstances which allowed the flow towards the elimination from South Vietnam of the Diệm regime, Kennedy held, were due to the active personality of Madame Nhu. The Secretary recalls the President&#x27;s feelings and in an oral history interview gave volunteered paraphrase of the words addressed to him,

==Downfall==

On 2 November 1963, Diệm and Nhu were assassinated in a coup d&#x27;état led by General Dương Văn Minh (Armed Forces Council) with the understanding that the United States would not intervene. At the time of the assassinations, Madame Nhu was in Beverly Hills, California, traveling with her 18-year-old daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Thủy. Her other children were in Vietnam at the family retreat in Đà Lạt and she feared that they would meet the same fate as their father. The children were not harmed by the generals and were flown out of the country into exile in Rome, where they were placed in the custody of their uncle, Archbishop Thục. Madame Nhu later flew to Rome to join them.

In response to the killings of Diệm and Nhu, she immediately accused the United States, saying &quot;Whoever has the Americans as allies does not need enemies&quot;, and that &quot;No coup can erupt without American incitement and backing&quot;. She went on to predict a bleak future for Vietnam and said that, by being involved in the coup, the troubles of the United States in Vietnam were just beginning. She called the deaths an &quot;indelible stigma&quot; against the U.S. and said &quot;My family has been treacherously killed with either official or unofficial blessing of the American government, I can predict to you now that the story is only at its beginning&quot;. She invoked biblical analogies, saying &quot;Judas has sold the Christ for thirty pieces of silver. The Ngô brothers have been sold for a few dollars&quot;. When asked if she wanted asylum in the United States, she said, &quot;I cannot stay in a country whose government stabbed me in the back. I believe all the devils in hell are against us&quot;.

In the aftermath of the coup, the statues of the Trưng Sisters that Madame Nhu had erected with her own facial features were demolished by jubilant anti-Diệm rioters. The &quot;Times of Vietnam&quot; office was also burned down, and the newspaper was never published again.

==Life in exile==
The military government of Vietnam under General Dương Văn Minh confiscated all of the property in Saigon that belonged to Madame Nhu and her family, and she was not allowed to return to South Vietnam. She went to Rome briefly before moving to France and later Italy, with her children. Her daughter, Lệ Thủy, died in 1967, at age 22, in a car accident in Longjumeau, France. Her younger daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Quyên, who grew up to be an Italian-Vietnamese human rights lawyer, also died in a car accident in 2012.

In November 1982 Madame Nhu accorded a first significant interview on the historic events in Vietnam to Judith Vecchione in Rome. Vecchione was a producer for &quot;&quot;. The interview, one of at least two hundred and fifty-nine for the series, lasts a recorded fifty-two minutes but Madame Nhu&#x27;s subjectivity was far from the hard facts demanded of the producers&#x27; intended content and barely two minutes of her observations found use. The series subsequently aired on PBS in 1983.

On 2 November 1986, Madame Nhu charged the United States with hounding her family during the arrest of her younger brother, Trần Văn Khiêm, who was charged in the strangling-deaths of their parents in their Washington, D.C., home after being cut out of their will.

In 1993, she sued her parents&#x27; insurance company to prevent it from awarding their death-benefit because she contested the validity of their wills. Her parents allegedly changed their wills, disinheriting their son Khiem and Madame Nhu and making their sister Le Chi the sole beneficiary.

In the 1990s, she was reportedly living on the French Riviera and charging the press for interviews. In 2002, she gave an interview to journalist Truong Phu Thu of &quot;Dân Chúa Mỹ Châu&quot;, a Vietnamese Catholic community publication. It was published in October 2004. The article stated that she was living in Paris and working on her memoirs.

In her last years, she lived with her eldest son, Ngô Đình Trác, and youngest daughter, Ngô Đình Lệ Quyên, in Rome, and was reportedly working on a book of memoirs to be published posthumously.

In early April 2011, she was taken to a hospital in Rome where she died three weeks later, on Easter Sunday, 24 April 2011. News of her death were announced by her sister Lechi Oggeri, while family friend Truong Phu Thu was interviewed by BBC News afterwards.

==Books about Madame Nhu==
* &quot;Finding the Dragon Lady: the Mystery of Vietnam&#x27;s Madame Nhu&quot;, authored by Monique Brinson Demery&lt;br&gt; (PublicAffairs Books, published September 2013). There is the significant claim upon this book that the author was ultimately entrusted with Madame Nhu&#x27;s unpublished memoirs; and that additionally revealed to the author had been a diary presented as Madame Nhu&#x27;s, from the years leading up to the coup, this having the only known provenance, a Vietnamese-American U.S. Army Captain James Văn Thạch.
* &quot;Trần Lệ Xuân Giấc Mộng Chính Trường&quot; (Vietnamese book)

* &quot;La République du Viêt-Nam et les Ngô-Đình&quot; – written by the children of Madame Nhu, Ngô Đình Quynh and Ngô Đình Lệ Quyên, also family friend Madame Jacqueline Willemetz (French book)

==Influence on Vietnamese fashion==
In the early 1960s, Madame Nhu popularized her own version of the traditional &quot;áo dài&quot; that was considered controversial in its day due to its tight fit and low-cut neckline. According to Boi Tran Huynh, a scholar of Vietnamese visual arts, &quot;To foreigners, this collar made sense given the tropical conditions, but conservatives saw it as too suggestive for Vietnamese women.&quot;

==Children==
* Ngô Đình Lệ Thủy was born in Hue in 1945. She died on 12 April 1967, in an automobile accident in Longjumeau, France.

<text>The Roaches (from the French &quot;les roches&quot; – the rocks) is a prominent rocky ridge above Leek and Tittesworth Reservoir in the Staffordshire Peak District of England. The ridge with its rock formations rises steeply to .

Along with Ramshaw Rocks and Hen Cloud, from Old English &quot;Henge Clud&quot;, meaning &quot;steep rock&quot;, they form a gritstone escarpment, which is popular with hikers, rock climbers and freerunners. It is often very busy especially at weekends.

The Roaches Estate was purchased by the Peak District National Park Authority in the 1980s to safeguard the area from adverse development. From May 2013 Staffordshire Wildlife Trust took on the management of the Roaches Estate.

In clear conditions, it is possible to see much of Cheshire and views stretching as far as Snowdon in Wales and Winter Hill in Lancashire.

The Roaches are the most prominent part of a curving ridge which extends for several miles from Hen Cloud in the south to Back Forest and Hangingstone in the northwest. At the top there is a small pool called Doxey Pool that is, according to legend, inhabited by a water spirit. Nearby are the broad hills of Gun and Morridge.

== Geology ==

The Roaches, Hen Cloud and Ramshaw Rocks are formed from a thick bed of coarse sandstone (&#x27;gritstone&#x27;) of Namurian age, a subdivision of the NW European Carboniferous system from ca 315 to 326.4 Ma, which occurs widely across the Peak District and takes its name, the Roaches Grit, from this location. The nearby Five Clouds are formed from a thinner bed of similar sandstone known as the Five Clouds Sandstone. These sandstones originated as delta sands dropped by major rivers draining a mountainous landmass to the north. The sandstone beds of both The Roaches and Hen Cloud dip moderately steeply to the east into the north–south-aligned syncline known as the Goyt Trough. The same beds at Ramshaw Rocks dip steeply to the northwest into the syncline. The southern end of the Roaches is defined by the presence of an east–west fault that runs through the col separating the Roaches from Hen Cloud.

==Wildlife==
In the 1930s five Australian Bennett&#x27;s wallabies were released into the wild from a private collection. The colony survived into the 21st century but may now be extinct.

In 2008, a pair of peregrine falcons successfully bred on the Roaches, causing climbing on part of the rock face to be suspended for a period. Since then, the resident pair of peregrine falcons has had further successful hatchings, although there have also been cases of theft of eggs and young birds at the site.

==Doxey Pool==

Doxey Pool (sometimes spelt &quot;Docksey&quot;) is a small pond, measuring about , by the top path of The Roaches at grid reference . Legend has it that this pool is inhabited by a mermaid called Jenny Greenteeth known as the blue nymph. The legend says that she fell in the pool on a foggy day whilst walking along the top of the Roaches, and ever since has been enticing unsuspecting victims down to the pool to a watery grave.

==The Winking Man==

The Winking Man rock formation (also known as the Winking Eye) is one of the buttresses at Ramshaw Rocks east of The Roaches. It can be seen from the Leek–Buxton road (A53) about 5 miles outside Leek. A slender rib of rock jutting out from the buttress is pierced by a natural hole. The silhouette of the rib against the sky looks like a face sticking out of the hillside, and to the traveller driving past in a car towards Buxton the &#x27;eye&#x27; appears to wink, as another pinnacle of rock passes behind the face as a consequence of parallax. A public house near Ramshaw Rocks at Upper Hulme takes its name from the Winking Man rock.

==Don Whillans Memorial Hut==

The Roaches is the site of the Don Whillans Memorial Hut, also known as the Rockhall Cottage. This Grade II listed building may have been a shooting box, and is built in cottage orné style.

<text>François Hédelin, abbé d&#x27;Aubignac (4 August 1604 in Paris – 27 July 1676) was a French author and cleric.

The father of François Hédelin was Claude Hédelin, a lawyer at the Parliament, and his mother Catherine Paré, the daughter of the famous surgeon Ambroise Paré. After practising some time at Nemours, he abandoned law, took holy orders, and was appointed tutor to one of Richelieu&#x27;s nephews, the duc de Fronsac. This patronage secured for him the abbeys of Aubignac and of Mainac. The death of the duc de Fronsac in 1646 put an end to hopes of further preferment, and Ambroise Paréd&#x27;Aubignac retired to Nemours, occupying himself with literature till his death.

He energetically participated in the literary controversies of his time. Against Gilles Ménage he wrote &quot;Térence justifié&quot; (1656); he laid claim to having originated the idea of the &quot;Carte de tendre&quot; of Mlle de Scudéry&#x27;s &quot;Clélié&quot;; and after being a professed admirer of Corneille, he turned against Corneille for having neglected to mention the abbé in his &quot;Discours sur le poème dramatique&quot;. He was the author of four tragedies: &quot;La Cyminde&quot; (1642), &quot;La Pucelle d&#x27;Orléans&quot; (1642), &quot;Zénobie&quot; (1647) and &quot;Le Martyre de Sainte Catherine&quot; (1650). &quot;Zénobie&quot; was written with the intention of affording a model in which the strict rules of the drama, as understood by the theorists, were served.

In choosing subjects for his plays, d&#x27;Aubignac seems to have been guided by a desire to illustrate the various kinds of tragedy—patriotic, antique and religious themes. In return, the dramatic authors whom he was in the habit of criticizing were quick to take advantage of the opportunity for retaliation offered by the production of these plays.

It is as a theorist that d&#x27;Aubignac is still remembered. The credit of having been the first to play so large a part in the history of the French stage belongs to Jean Chapelain; but the laws of dramatic method and construction generally were codified by d&#x27;Aubignac in his &quot;Pratique du théâtre&quot;. The book was only published in 1657, but he had begun writing it under Richelieu&#x27;s urging as early as 1640.
His &quot;Conjectures académiques ou dissertation sur l&#x27;Iliade d&#x27;Homère&quot;, which was not published until nearly forty years after his death, threw doubts on the existence of Homer, and anticipated in some sense the conclusions of Friedrich August Wolf in his &quot;Prolegomena ad Homerum&quot; (1795).

The contents of the &quot;Pratique du théâtre&quot; were summarized by Ferdinand Brunetière in his notice of d&#x27;Aubignac in the &quot;Grande Encyclopédie&quot;. See also G Saintsbury, &quot;Hist. of Criticism&quot;, bk v., and Hippolyte Rigault, &quot;Histoire de la querelle des anciens et modernes&quot; (1859).

<text>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. () is an American multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Originally a textile manufacturer, the company transitioned into a conglomerate starting in 1965 under the management of chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and vice chairman Charlie Munger (from 1978 to 2023). Greg Abel now oversees most of the company&#x27;s investments and has been named as the successor to Buffett. Buffett personally owns 38.4% of the Class A voting shares of Berkshire Hathaway, representing a 15.1% overall economic interest in the company.

The company is often compared to an investment fund; between 1965, when Buffett gained control of the company, and 2023, the company&#x27;s shareholder returns amounted to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.8% compared to a 10.2% CAGR for the S&amp;P 500. However, in the 10 years ending in 2023, Berkshire Hathaway produced a CAGR of 11.8% for shareholders, compared to a 12.0% CAGR for the S&amp;P 500. From 1965 to 2023, the stock price had negative performance in only eleven years. In August 2024, Berkshire Hathaway became the eighth U.S. public company and the first non-technology company to be valued at over $1 trillion on the list of public corporations by market capitalization.

Berkshire Hathaway is ranked 5th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and 9th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500. Berkshire is one of the ten largest components of the S&amp;P 500 and is on the list of largest employers in the United States. Its class A shares have the highest per-share price of any public company in the world, reaching $700,000 in August 2024, because the board of directors has historically been opposed to stock splits.

==History==

Berkshire Hathaway originated as a textile manufacturer formed in 1955 from the merger of Hathaway Manufacturing Company and Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. After the merger, Berkshire Hathaway had 15 plants employing over 12,000 workers with over $120 million in revenue, and was headquartered in New Bedford. However, seven of those locations were closed by the end of the 1950s, accompanied by large layoffs.

In 1962, Warren Buffett began buying Berkshire Hathaway stock for his investment fund, Buffett Partnership Ltd., at $7.50 per share, anticipating that as the company liquidated textile mills there would come a tender offer when he could sell the shares at a profit. A year later, Buffett&#x27;s fund owned 7% of the company. In 1964, Buffett offered to sell his shares back to the company for $11.50 each. Seabury Stanton, the manager of Berkshire Hathaway, told Buffett orally that he had a deal. A few weeks later, Warren Buffett received the tender offer in writing, but the tender offer was for only $11.375 per share. Buffett later admitted that this lower, undercutting offer made him angry. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett bought more of the stock at an even higher price to take control of the company and fire Stanton; Stanton and his son resigned in 1965. However, this left Buffett&#x27;s fund with a major interest in a declining textile business.

Buffett has described purchasing the Berkshire Hathaway textile company as the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, denying him compounded investment returns of about $200 billion over the subsequent 45 years. He has estimated that had he invested the same money directly in insurance businesses instead of indirectly via Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), it would have paid off several hundredfold. In 1985, the company&#x27;s last textile operations were shut down.

In 1963, Franklin Otis Booth Jr. invested $1 million in the company and in 1968, David Gottesman invested in the company. The investments made both individuals billionaires.

It now prints only a morning edition. Berkshire formed BH Media Group with a purchase of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; in December 2011, which included six other daily newspapers and several weeklies across Nebraska and southwest Iowa.

===Major stock purchases and sales===
Buffett began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989; however, by the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway had sold its entire interest in the company.

Buffett has had a long relationship with Jeff Bezos; he turned down an opportunity to invest in Amazon.com in 1994 as he was unable to predict the company&#x27;s future growth and it was losing money. Berkshire Hathaway purchased shares in Amazon in 2019 currently worth $2 billion.

Berkshire made its first investment in Tesco in 2006, and in 2012 it raised this stake to over 5% of the company, investing a total of $2.3 billion. Buffett sold around 30% of this stake in 2013 when he &quot;soured somewhat on the company&#x27;s then-management&quot;, realizing a profit of $43 million. As Tesco&#x27;s problems mounted through 2014, Berkshire sold all the remaining shares with Buffett saying to shareholders that the delay in selling shares was costly. Berkshire realized an after-tax loss of $444 million on the Tesco investment.

In early 2008, Berkshire increased its stake in ConocoPhillips to 85 million shares. Buffett later described this as &quot;a major mistake&quot; as the price of oil collapsed during the Great Recession. Berkshire sold most of its shares but held 472,000 shares until 2012. That year, ConocoPhillips completed the corporate spin-off of Phillips 66, of which Berkshire owned 27 million shares. Berkshire later sold $1.4 billion worth of shares to Phillips 66 in exchange for Phillips Specialty Products. Buffett frequently referred to Phillips 66 as one of the best businesses Berkshire invested in because of its consistent dividends and share repurchase programs. However, Berkshire sold its entire holdings in 2020.

In September 2008, at the peak of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Berkshire invested $5 billion in preferred stock in Goldman Sachs to provide it with a source of funding when capital markets had become constrained. The preferred stock yielded an annual interest rate of 10%, earning Berkshire $500 million in interest income per year. Berkshire also received warrants to purchase 43.5 million shares with at $115 per share, which were exercisable at any time for a five-year term. Goldman had the right to re-purchase the preferred stock at a 10% premium, and in March 2011 exercised this right paying $5.5 billion to Berkshire. Profit on the preferred stock was estimated at $1.8 billion and exercising the warrants yielded a profit of more than $2 billion. Buffett defended Lloyd Blankfein&#x27;s decisions as CEO of Goldman Sachs and his efforts to improve the reputation of the company during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

In September 2008, BHE invested about US$230 million for approximately a 10% share of BYD Auto. Some shares were sold in 2023 and 2024, with Buffett motivated by the China–United States trade war.

In October 2008, Berkshire invested $6.5 billion in Wrigley Company as part of a financing package to enable Mars Inc. to acquire the company. Berkshire sold its remaining bonds and preferred stock to Mars in 2016. 

In early 2011, Berkshire first invested in IBM. The shares were entirely sold in 2018.

On August 26, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway purchased $5 billion of preferred shares in Bank of America. The shares yielded 6%, earning Berkshire $300 million in annual interest. Alongside the preferred stock investment, Berkshire obtained warrants allowing Berkshire to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per share, which were exercised. By 2017, this position had yielded a profit of about $12 billion excluding the annual interest earned from the preferred stock.

In 2013, Berkshire and 3G Capital acquired H. J. Heinz Company for $28 billion including debt. In 2015, Heinz merged with Kraft Foods to form Kraft Heinz. In 2019, Buffett said that he overpaid in the deal.

In 2013, Berkshire owned 1.74 million shares of Gannett; however, it sold its shares in the second quarter of 2013.

In the first quarter of 2016, Berkshire began investing in Apple Inc., with a purchase of 9.8 million shares (0.2% of Apple) worth $1 billion. By the end of June 2016, this stake had increased to 15.2 million shares (0.3% of Apple). By December 31, 2016, Berkshire had built up a stake of 57.4 million shares (1.1% of Apple) with an estimated average acquisition price of $110 per share (before the 2020 4:1 split). Aggressive stock purchases continued and by March 31, 2017, Berkshire had amassed a stake of 129 million shares (2.5% of Apple). By December 31, 2017, Berkshire owned 166 million shares (3.3% of Apple). Berkshire bought 75 million more shares in early 2018. Berkshire owned 5.8% of Apple. Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by nearly 50%, selling $75.5 billion worth of stock in the second quarter of 2024, increasing its cash reserves to a record $276.9 billion. Buffett had said that Apple has developed an ecosystem and level of brand loyalty that provides it with an economic moat, and that consumers appear to have a degree of price insensitivity when it comes to the iPhone. While Buffett generally does not invest in tech stocks, he has said that Apple is a consumer products company and that he understands consumer products businesses.

In the third quarter of 2016, Berkshire surprised investors by making large equity investments in the major US airlines. Buffett had previously described airlines as a &quot;deathtrap for investors&quot;. Buffett had made an investment in US Airways in 1989 which, although he sold for a profit, almost lost Berkshire a substantial sum of money. In 2017, Berkshire was the largest shareholder in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines and a top 3 shareholder in Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. Buffett himself has described this as a &quot;call on the industry&quot; rather than a choice in an individual company. American Airlines&#x27; CEO Doug Parker is said to have won over Ted Weschler in arguing that the airline industry had consolidated sufficiently and rationalized supply such that longer-term profitability could be achieved in an industry that has historically been loss-making in aggregate. In April 2020, Berkshire sold all shares in the airlines due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air transport.

In June 2017, Berkshire invested $377 million Store Capital, a Scottsdale-based real estate investment trust that owned more than 1,750 properties in 48 states; the company was sold to private equity firms in 2022.

Between September 2019 and August 2020, Berkshire purchased more than 5% of the outstanding stock of each of the five largest Japanese sogo shosha (Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Marubeni) through its National Indemnity subsidiary. These stakes were worth a total of over $6 billion as of August 2020. By April 2023, Berkshire increased its stake in each of those companies to 7.4%. He continued to increase the stakes over time.

In the second quarter of 2020, Berkshire added a position of more than 20 million shares in Barrick Gold; the shares were sold in 2021. In the third quarter of 2020, the company agreed to buy Dominion Energy&#x27;s natural gas transmission and storage operations.

In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired a $2.6 billion stake in Paramount Global. However, at an annual meeting on May 4, 2024, Buffett stated that he had sold all of his shares in Paramount at a substantial loss, blaming himself for deciding to invest.

In the first quarter of 2022, Berkshire acquired 121 million shares of HP Inc. valued at more than $4.2 billion; the shares were sold in 2023 and 2024.

In the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire purchased 60 million shares in TSMC valued at $4.1 billion; the shares were sold in late 2022 and 2023 in part due to geopolitical tensions.

Berkshire began investing in Chubb Limited in 2023; by 2024, it owned a 6.4% stake worth $6.7 billion.

Berkshire Hathaway bought 5.62 million shares of Constellation Brands (STZ) in the fourth quarter of 2024. This new position was worth approximately $1.24 billion at the end of the year 2024. The purchase made Berkshire Hathaway the sixth-largest shareholder of Constellation Brands.

Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in Ulta Beauty in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company exited its position in Ulta Beauty just two quarters after initially acquiring shares in the second quarter of 2024.

== Selected holdings ==
=== Subsidiaries ===
===Securities===
Aside from its subsidiaries, Berkshire manages a portfolio of non-controlling stock investments into which its insurance companies invest policy premiums. These holdings are broadly disclosed in its Form 13F filings, although the company sometimes obtains permission to keep active trades confidential.

In addition to these equity positions, the company had $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, more than any other U.S.-based public company. Berkshire&#x27;s annual reports since 2008 have emphasized its commitment to holding ample cash to cover near-term insurance obligations.

==Corporate affairs==
===Investment strategy===
Insurance is a major area of operations and the retained premiums (float) serve as an important source of capital. Buffett has said that he prefers to invest in evergreen businesses that generate predictable long-term returns, that he doesn&#x27;t invest in companies that he doesn&#x27;t understand, and that he does not like to invest in companies that may undergo significant change. The company has generally avoided investing in high-tech firms, missing early opportunities to invest in Microsoft and Amazon.com despite having relationships with the founders of those companies. With some exceptions, the company also usually does not invest in real property due to precise pricing, lack of competitive advantage, complex management, and corporation tax disadvantages.

===Share classes and aversion to stock splits===
Berkshire Hathaway has never undergone a stock split of its Class A shares because of management&#x27;s desire to attract long-term investors as opposed to short-term speculation. However, in 1996, Berkshire Hathaway created Class B shares, with a per-share value of of that of the original shares (now Class A) and of the per-share voting rights, and after the January 2010 split, at the price and the voting rights of the Class-A shares. Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa. Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares but did so to thwart the creation of unit investment trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes.

In January 2010, as part of the acquisition of BNSF Railway, Berkshire completed a 50-to-1 stock split of its class B shares. The increased market liquidity resulted in the company&#x27;s inclusion in the S&amp;P 500.

===IPO and share price===
On March 16, 1980, Berkshire became a public company via an initial public offering, selling Class A shares for $290 each. Shares closed over $1,000 for the first time on August 26, 1983 and over $10,000 on October 16, 1992. Shares closed over $100,000 for the first time on October 23, 2006. They first closed over $200,000 on August 14, 2014. Shares closed over $500,000 for the first time on March 16, 2022.

===Executive compensation===
The salary for Buffett is $100,000 per year with no stock options, which is among the lowest salaries for CEOs of large companies in the United States. Buffett&#x27;s salary has not changed in 35 years. Buffett also receives approximately $300,000 worth home security services from the company annually.

Abel and Jain each receive a salary of $20 million per year, with a possible $3 million annual bonus at the discretion of Buffett.

===Annual letters and shareholders&#x27; meetings===
Buffett&#x27;s letters to shareholders are published annually. 

Berkshire&#x27;s annual shareholders&#x27; meetings, nicknamed &quot;Woodstock for Capitalists&quot;, take place at the CHI Health Center Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska. Attendance generally totals over 40,000 people and the meetings last for 6 to 8 hours, with Buffett himself, as well as Abel and Jain, answering questions from shareholders.

Known for their humor and light-heartedness, the meetings typically start with a cartoon made for Berkshire shareholders. 
* The 2004 cartoon featured Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of &quot;The Warrenator&quot; who travels through time to stop Buffett and Munger&#x27;s attempt to save the world from a &quot;mega&quot; corporation formed by Microsoft-Starbucks-Wal-Mart. Schwarzenegger is later shown arguing in a gym with Buffett regarding Proposition 13. 
* The 2006 cartoon depicted actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Nicollette Sheridan lusting after Munger.
* The 2007 cartoon included Buffett playing basketball against LeBron James.
* The 2008 cartoon depicted Charlie Munger becoming President of the United States, after which he promotes eating at Dairy Queen to relieve the effects of increased temperatures due to climate change.
* The 2009 cartoon, aired just after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, showed a new mattress, named The Nervous Nellie, which has a hidden compartment for people who prefer to hide their money in the mattress than put it in the bank.
* The 2016 cartoon featured a spoof of the 1983 film &quot;Trading Places&quot;; in this version, Munger and Jain along with the GEICO gecko conspire to manipulate the market for cocoa beans to affect See’s Candy.
* The 2022 cartoon featured a veterinarian who expanded his business using his American Express credit card.

<doc id="314336" wikidata="Q469888" url="?curid=314336" title="Lewis Mumford">
<text>Lewis Mumford (October 19, 1895 – January 26, 1990) was an American historian, sociologist, philosopher of technology, and literary critic. Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer. He made significant contributions to social philosophy, American literary and cultural history, and the history of technology. 

Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir Patrick Geddes and worked closely with his associate the British sociologist Victor Branford. Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of Frank Lloyd Wright, Clarence Stein, Frederic Osborn, Edmund N. Bacon, and Vannevar Bush. 

== Life ==
===Early life and education===
Mumford was born in Flushing, Queens, New York, and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1912. He studied at the City College of New York and The New School for Social Research, but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the Navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician. He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of &quot;The Dial&quot;, an influential modernist literary journal. He later worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.

===First book===
Mumford&#x27;s earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting influence on contemporary American literary criticism. His first book was &quot;The Story of Utopias&quot; (1922), an insightful exploration of the many visions of a better world that influenced the development of modern urban planning theory. In &quot;The Golden Day&quot; (1926), he argued for a mid-19th-century American literary canon comprising Herman Melville, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman, all of whom he argued reflected an antebellum American culture of the period that would be destroyed by the late-19th-century social changes wrought by the American Civil War and industrialization of the United States. &quot;Herman Melville&quot; (1929), which combined an account of Melville&#x27;s life with an interpretive discussion of his work, was an important part of the Melville revival.

===Correspondence===
Mumford was a close friend of the psychologist Henry Murray, with whom he corresponded extensively from 1928 until the 1960s on topics including Herman Melville, psychology, American values and culture, and the nature of the self.

===Urban planning===
In his early writings on life in an urban area, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities, arguing that the human race would use electricity and mass communication to build a better world for all humankind. Mumford later took a more pessimistic stance on the sweeping technological improvements brought by the Second Industrial Revolution. His early architectural criticism helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.

===Honours===
Mumford was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1941 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947. In 1963, Mumford received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association. Mumford received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). In 1976, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca. In 1986, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

===Further publications===
He served as the architectural critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine for over 30 years. His 1961 book, &quot;The City in History&quot;, received the National Book Award.

===Retirement===
Lewis Mumford died at the age of 94 at his home in Amenia, New York, on January 26, 1990. Nine years later the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. His wife Sophia died in 1997, at age 97.

== Ideas ==
In his book &quot;The Condition of Man&quot;, published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as &quot;organic humanism.&quot; The term is important because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these elements had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature&#x27;s threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford&#x27;s respect for human &quot;nature&quot;, that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and techniques in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he subscribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of Marshall McLuhan, who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.

Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex. He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information &quot;pooling&quot; in the world as humanity moved into the future. Mumford&#x27;s choice of the word &quot;technics&quot; throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the Greek &quot;tekhne&quot;, which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the &quot;wishes, habits, ideas, goals&quot; as well as &quot;industrial processes&quot; of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of &quot;Technics and Civilization&quot;, &quot;other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics.&quot;

===Megatechnics===
In &quot;The Myth of the Machine Vol II: The Pentagon of Power&quot; (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford criticizes the modern trend of technology, which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called &quot;megatechnics,&quot; fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer credit, installment buying, non-functioning and defective designs, planned obsolescence, and frequent superficial &quot;fashion&quot; changes. &quot;Without constant enticement by advertising,&quot; he writes, &quot;production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year.&quot; He uses his own refrigerator as an example, reporting that it &quot;has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use.&quot;

===Biotechnics===
Mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between techniques and bioviability. The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area&#x27;s capability to support life. Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically. Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability. Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technology advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics. Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technology needed to shake off the suicidal drive of &quot;megatechnics.&quot; While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford&#x27;s mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.

In Mumford&#x27;s understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth&#x27;s distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.

Thus, Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve &quot;livability.&quot; Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls &quot;plenitude&quot;; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue &quot;for its own sake&quot;. Alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford&#x27;s words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward &quot;qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair.&quot; The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.

Mumford&#x27;s critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford&#x27;s work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: &quot;livability,&quot; a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, Patrick Geddes. Mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of &quot;The Pentagon of Power&quot;, written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of &quot;organic humanism,&quot; in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics. It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.

It is true that Mumford&#x27;s writing privileges the term &quot;biotechnics&quot; more than the &quot;biotechnic society.&quot; The reason is clear in the last sentence of &quot;The Pentagon of Power&quot; where he writes, &quot;for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out.&quot; Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them &quot;coffins&quot;). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s philosophy of the organism.

===Polytechnics versus monotechnics===
A key idea, introduced in &quot;Technics and Civilization&quot; (1934) was that technology was twofold:
* &quot;Polytechnic&quot;, which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
* &quot;Monotechnic&quot;, which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.

Mumford commonly criticized modern America&#x27;s transportation networks as being &quot;monotechnic&quot; in their reliance on cars. Automobiles become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as walking, bicycle and public transit, because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a ritual sacrifice the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.

===Three epochs of civilization===
Also discussed at length in &quot;Technics and Civilization&quot; is Mumford&#x27;s division of human civilization into three distinct epochs (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):
:* &quot;Eotechnic&quot; (the Middle Ages)
:* &quot;Paleotechnic&quot; (the time of the Industrial Revolution) and
:* &quot;Neotechnic&quot; (later, present-day)

===Megamachines===
Mumford also refers to large hierarchical organizations as &quot;megamachines&quot;—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford&#x27;s stage theory of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern technocratic nuclear powers—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the Kremlin and the Pentagon, respectively. The builders of the pyramids, the Roman Empire and the armies of the World Wars are prior examples.

He explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged pharaohs and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from ancient Egypt to Nazi Germany.

Necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous bureaucracy of humans which act as &quot;servo-units&quot;, working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the assembly line, or instant, global, wireless, communication and remote control, can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of the Holocaust. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as &quot;Eichmanns&quot;.

===The clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution===

One of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the mechanical clock was developed by monks in the Middle Ages and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole Industrial Revolution, contrary to the common view of the steam engine holding the prime position, writing: &quot;The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose &#x27;product&#x27; is seconds and minutes ...&quot;

===Urban civilization===
&quot;The City in History&quot; won the 1962 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction. In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of urban sprawl, Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While pessimistic in tone, Mumford argues that urban planning should emphasize an &#x27;organic&#x27; relationship between people and their living spaces. Mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the &quot;ideal city,&quot; and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.

Mumford wrote critically of urban culture believing the city is &quot;a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man&#x27;s method of expression.&quot; Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared &quot;metropolitan finance,&quot; urbanization, politics, and alienation. Mumford wrote: &quot;The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community.&quot;

====Suburbs====
Suburbia did not escape Mumford&#x27;s criticism either:

In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.

=== Religion and spirituality ===
Mumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field. In one of his least well-known books, &quot;Faith for Living&quot; (1940), Mumford argues:

The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.

== Influence ==
Mumford&#x27;s interest in the history of technology and his explanation of &quot;polytechnics&quot;, along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as Jacques Ellul, Witold Rybczynski, Richard Gregg, Amory Lovins, J. Baldwin, E. F. Schumacher, Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Murray Bookchin, Thomas Merton, Marshall McLuhan, Colin Ward, and Kevin Carson—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology. Mumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like Barry Commoner and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology. Ramachandra Guha noted his work contains &quot;some of the earliest and finest thinking on bioregionalism, anti-nuclearism, biodiversity, alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology.&quot; Mumford&#x27;s influence is also evident in the work of some artists including Berenice Abbott&#x27;s photographs of New York City in the late 1930s. Mumford was an inspiration for Ellsworth Toohey, the antagonist in Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (1943).

<text>Locarno (; ; Ticinese: ; formerly in ) is a southern Swiss town and municipality in the district Locarno (of which it is the capital), located on the northern shore of Lake Maggiore at its northeastern tip in the canton of Ticino at the southern foot of the Swiss Alps. It has a population of about 16,000 (proper), and about 56,000 for the agglomeration of the same name including Ascona besides other municipalities.

The town of Locarno is located on the northeastern part of the river Maggia&#x27;s delta; across the river lies the town of Ascona on the southwestern part of the delta.

Locarno is the 74th largest city in Switzerland by population and the third largest in the Ticino canton, after Lugano and Bellinzona.

The official language of Locarno is Italian.

The town is known for hosting the Locarno International Film Festival which takes place every year in August and involves open-air screenings at the main square, the Piazza Grande. It is also known for the Locarno Treaties, a series of European territorial agreements negotiated here in October 1925.

==History==

===Prehistoric Locarno===
In 1934, in the vicinity of today&#x27;s Via S. Jorio, a necropolis with 14 urn graves from the Early Bronze Age (about 14th century BC) were found. Some of the urns were directly buried, while others were placed in boxes of uncut stone. The urns contained, in addition to burned bones, bronze ornaments, which had some fire damage, including, bangles, hairpins with conical head and slightly thickened neck, rings and knives. Similar urns were also discovered in the district of S. Antonio, which was probably also a small cemetery. The ceramic and bronze objects date from the Canegrate culture (named after a large necropolis in the province of Milan). However, no traces of the settlement have been discovered.

In 1935, a large necropolis was discovered at Solduno. The over 200 graves cover nearly a thousand years, from the La Tène culture to the 3rd century AD. Many of the La Tène era grave goods (particularly from the 3rd–1st centuries BC) are Celtic style Fibulae or brooches. These objects demonstrate a cultural influence from regions north of the Alps. However, the ceramic objects are indigenous to Golasecca culture which spread into Ticino and Lombardy.

===Roman era===
Between 1946 and 1949, a number of Roman era tombs were discovered on the terrace between the churches of Santa Maria in Selva and San Giovanni Battista in Solduno. The Roman city that became Locarno was therefore between the vicus of Muralto and this cemetery. Intensive construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most traces of the ancient city. In 1995 and 1997, 57 graves were found in Via Valle Maggia. Nineteen were from the Roman period, which confirms that even in the 3rd century AD cremation and body burials were practised side by side. Among other significant finds, several glass items were discovered. The Roman necropolis was used from the end of the prehistoric La Tène era until the middle of the 3rd century AD. The extensive Romanization of Locarno wiped out much of the local culture and replaced it with ancient Roman elements. However, it appears that there was no Roman ruling class which could have dominated the local population.

===Capitanei di Locarno===
The capitanei were a group of prominent noble families who emerged in the early Middle Ages and led Locarno. The term is first mentioned in a document granting market rights to the town by the Emperor Frederick I in 1164. This title was originally reserved only for the direct vassals of the king&#x27;s fief. The lower vassals were known as &quot;valvassores&quot;, but could have been awarded the title of &quot;capitanei&quot; as a special concession. The original &quot;capitanei&quot; were probably descendants of the old Lombard noble family of Da Besozzo from the county of Seprio, a historic region of Lombard Italy which comprised areas in southern Ticino and modern-day Italian provinces of Varese and Como on the western side of Lake Maggiore, and was centred in Castelseprio, some 20 kilometres south of Locarno.

Around 1000, the family was granted a fief in Locarno by the schismatic Bishop of Como Landolfo da Carcano. The &quot;capitanei&quot; were given the right to manage the property of the Church entrusted to the local pieve, they had the rights of immunity and coercion, but were not owners of the village cooperatives&#x27; (&quot;vicini&quot;) land, with the exception of the churches and royal estates. They did not have the right of high justice so their political power was limited. However, they played an important role in the later conflicts in the 13th and 14th centuries between the Guelphs and Ghibellines and in the wars between Como and the Duchy of Milan.

In Locarno, during the Reformation period in the 16th century, two of the three great feudal families of capitanei, the Muralto and the Orelli families, left the town and moved to Zürich. A branch of the Muraltos was established in Bern. The third great Locarno family, the Magoria, remained in Locarno. The &quot;capitanei&quot; retained a central role in Locarno&#x27;s politics until 1798. In 1803, the lands and rights of the &quot;capitanei&quot; were integrated into the political municipality of Locarno.

===Early Locarno===

Starting in the Lombard period (after 569), the area around Locarno (and presumably the town) was part of the county Stazzona and later the Mark of Lombardy. Locarno is first mentioned in 807 as &quot;Leocarni&quot;. In German, it came to be known as &quot;Luggarus&quot;, &quot;Lucarius&quot;, &quot;Lucaris&quot;. It is likely that a market existed at or near the lake since the Roman era. The long history of the town and its location led to the creation of a royal court, which was first mentioned in 866. During the Middle Ages Locarno and Ascona formed a community, with several, separate neighbourhoods. The community managed its common goods (alpine pastures, pastures, forests, churches) and tax officials and police.

In the 10th century, Bishop of Milan began to consolidate more and more power to himself at the expense of the Kings of the Germans. This expansion by Milan was countered by Henry II, who incorporated Locarno in 1002/04 with the surrounding areas into the Diocese of Como. Friedrich Barbarossa granted extensive market rights to Locarno in 1164 and granted imperial immediacy in 1186. Due to these privileges, Locarno developed substantial local autonomy, which assisted in the development of municipal institutions. The nobles (&quot;Nobili&quot;) lost more and more rights to the citizens (&quot;borghesi&quot;). By 1224, the &quot;borghesi&quot; had their own administration and various privileges, including: market rights, the right to their own weights, maintenance of mills and grazing rights in Saleggi, in Colmanicchio (&quot;Alp Vignasca&quot;) and in the Magadino and Quartino valleys.

Locarno was the administrative centre of the parish of Locarno. The &quot;Podestà&quot; or high government official, resided in the Casa della Gallinazza, which was burned in 1260 during the clashes between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Several Locarno families, including members of the &quot;Capitanei di Locarno&quot; and Simone da Orello, played an important role in the battles between the two factions. In 1342, Luchino and Giovanni Visconti conquered the area, which brought Locarno back under the power of Milan. In 1439, Count Franchino Rusca was awarded Locarno as a fief.

In 1291, a Humiliati monastery was first mentioned in Locarno. St. Catherine&#x27;s church, attached to the monastery, probably dates to the mid-14th century.

===Under the Swiss Confederation===

The rule of the Rusca ended in 1503, when the Confederates occupied Locarno, but failed to conquer the Visconti castle. After the battle of Novara in 1513, the French King Louis XII gave the Confederates the castle. In the Treaty of Freiburg in 1516, they received all of Locarno. The Twelve Cantons took turns appointing a governor (), to rule over Locarno. The governor had both civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in certain cases after 1578, where seven judges were elected by the locals to try the cases. On taking office, the governor swore under oath to obey the statutes of Locarno. The governor was supported by a local mayor, and criminal fines were usually given to the local community.

The rule of the Twelve Cantons also affected the social and political relations of the town. In addition to the nobility (representing the three old noble families Orelli, Muralto and Magoria) and citizens, there was a third group. This third group, the &quot;terrieri&quot;, was a group of residents who had lived a long time in Locarno, but were not citizens. Each of the three groups was a statutory corporation, with shared property and a governing body. Under the Confederation, each of these groups or corporations had representation in the &quot;Consiglio Magnifico&quot; which ruled Locarno. However, the town&#x27;s dominance over the villages in the region, until 1798, is clearly shown in their representation in the council. The three groups in Locarno had twelve aldermen (six nobles, four citizens and two &quot;terrieri&quot;), while all the rural communities together had only eight members.

During the Middle Ages, Locarno was centred around the intersection of Via Cittadella and Via S. Antonio. The town stretched up the slope of the mountain and behind the castle. Some houses lined the shore, and above the Contrada Borghese a small, almost rural settlement grew up. The centre of town was dominated by townhouses with their large courtyards and gardens. The members of the upper class also owned small country houses with vineyards, which went up the hill behind Locarno as well as in Solduno and Cugnasco. Locarno also had several noble estates during the Late Middle Ages, including the so-called Cittadella. The buildings of the 17th and 18th centuries, including the Casa Simona (16th to 18th century), the Casa Rusca from the first half of the 18th century (now the seat of the municipal art gallery) and the Casa del Negromante, were built on older structures and didn&#x27;t change the layout of the town.

===Locarno&#x27;s castles===
There were several castles from the Early Middle Ages in Locarno. One was destroyed by the Milanese in 1156. Another, first mentioned in 1210 as Orelli castle, was occupied in 1342 by the Visconti and enlarged. This castle came to be known as Visconti Castle. In 1531, the Confederates demolished much of the castle, leaving only the central core. The castle was used as the residence of the governor, but in the following centuries, it began to fall apart. From 1804 to 1909, the castle was the seat of the administrative governor and the District Court. After 1909, it came into the possession of the city and was renovated in 1921–28. Since 1920, it has housed the city and Archaeological Museum. In 1507, a defensive bastion or ravelin was added to protect the castle entrance. It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci designed this structure. North-east of the castle is Palazzo Casorella (Casa degli Orelli) from the 16th century.

===Early modern Locarno===

During the Middle Ages, the economy of Locarno and the whole region was closely linked with the nobles who owned the market, fishing, alpine and grazing rights and tithes. Starting in the 13th century, some of these privileges went to the citizens&#x27; corporation. The hill areas were dominated by viticulture, while grain was raised in the plains. Within the town, vegetables and fruits were grown. Artisans and stores were concentrated in the interior of the town. The repeatedly flooded shorelines and the alpine pastures were used for grazing. In the early modern period, Locarno developed into a thriving commercial centre on an important road that linked the major cities of Lombardy, with German-speaking Switzerland and Germany. Cereals and salt came from Lombardy and Piedmont to Locarno, while Locarno and its hinterland (especially the Maggia Valley) provided large quantities of wood and cattle to Italy.

The parish church of Locarno, S. Antonio Abate, was first built in 1353–54. It was replaced by the current building in 1664. The decoration of the church was financed, primarily, by the grain traders at the end of the 17th century, and the chapel frescoes are by Giuseppe Antonio Felice Orelli from 1742. The citizens of Locarno had the right to appoint priests at S. Antonio Abate, S. Maria in Selva (consecrated in 1424, since 1884 only the choir and bell tower remain) and SS Trinità dei Monti (consecrated 1621). The church of San Francesco, together with the adjoining convent, were built in the early 13th century. The church&#x27;s first consecration was probably in 1230, but the first documented consecration of the church was in 1316. It was rebuilt and enlarged between 1538 and 1675 using construction material from Visconti Castle. San Francesco hosted the meetings of the nobility and the citizens. Starting in the 16th century, the appointed governor swore his oath in the church.

In the 16th century, the Humiliati order was suppressed and St. Catherine&#x27;s church and monastery closed. All three ruling groups of Locarno agreed to convert the church and monastery into the Hospital S. Carlo. The Hospital remained until 1854 when it closed, due to financial reasons.

In the 16th century, Locarno&#x27;s population declined as a result of the exodus of Protestants and the plague in 1576–77. After a recovery in the 17th century, the population declined considerably in the 18th century again.

===Protestant Reformation===
By 1535, there was a Protestant community known as the &quot;ecclesia christiana locarnensis&quot; in Locarno. They owed their existence to the work of Giovanni Beccaria, several notables of the town (including Taddeo Duni) and religious refugees from Milan and Piedmont. To counteract the tensions, the Protestant community and the Catholic clergy met for a debate on 8 May 1549. At the end of the debate, Beccaria was imprisoned. However, because of protests against his arrest, he was immediately released. In 1550, Locarno declared itself to be a Catholic town, but a large group continued to practice the Protestant faith. However, in 1554, the Diet of Baden issued an ultimatum to the Protestants, either renounce their new faith or go into exile. On 3 March 1555, over 100 people left Locarno to emigrate to Zürich.

In the course of Counter-Reformation in the 17th century, many religious buildings in Locarno were renewed or rebuilt. These include the 1604 church dedicated to SS Sebastiano e Rocco with the Capuchin monastery and the church of S. Maria Assunta (Chiesa Nuova).

===The Canton of Ticino===
Under the Helvetic Republic (1798–1803) Locarno was part of the Canton of Lugano. Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, the Act of Mediation, in 1803, created the Canton of Ticino with Locarno as an independent municipality. The Helvetic Republic was very liberal and attempted to reform much of Swiss society. However, the changes were too great and the Republic collapsed. The compromise Act of Mediation changed some aspects of society but left others unchanged. The new municipality of Lucarno was no longer ruled by three different &quot;patriziati&quot;, which had emerged from the three groups (nobles, &quot;borghesi&quot; and &quot;terrieri&quot;), but until the mid-19th century there were institutions that reached back to the Ancien Régime. For example, the community of Locarno and Ascona was dissolved in 1805. Nevertheless, a &quot;committee of the representatives of the former communities of Locarno&quot; managed, for several decades, the S. Carlo Hospital and schools, which had been shared by the &quot;patriziati&quot; of the old, combined community. However, the power of the old &quot;patriziati&quot; gradually weakened. In 1859, the &quot;terrieri&quot; decided to set aside their corporation. The nobles corporation distributed its assets in 1866–67 to its members and dissolved the archive, but retained until about 1920, the fishing rights. Only the citizens&#x27; corporation has preserved its status as a civil community.

The Constitution of 1814, established Locarno, Bellinzona and Lugano as the capitals of the canton, in a six-year rotation. Locarno was the capital of the canton in 1821–27, 1839–45, 1857–63 and 1875–81. In 1838–39, on the initiative of a group of notables, a government building was built. It was sold in 1893 to a private company. It then became the headquarters of Credito Ticinese and since 1917 it has been the headquarters of the Electricity Company of Sopraceneri. Locarno was repeatedly the scene of political clashes. In 1839 and 1841, uprisings against the government broke out. In 1855, a murder in a coffee house was used as a pretext for a coup of radicals (&quot;pronunciamento&quot;). Another coup, the Ticino coup of 1890, did nothing to change the balance of power between the parties in the city. After a liberal mayor ruled for 35 consecutive years (1865–80), a conservative mayor ruled for another 36 years (1880–1916).

To break the conservative hegemony of the late 19th century, the Social Democrats, allied with the Liberals in 1916 elections. They succeeded to a majority in the city government (which then consisted of nine members, but in 1987 was limited to seven), which they kept in the following decades.

In the 19th century, the population in Locarno grew noticeably compared to neighbouring communities. As early as 1836, the immigrant population was over 16% of the population. Between 1860 and 1880, the population fell slightly mainly because of emigration to California. In the following decades, the growth rates were below those of other population centres of the canton, which, unlike Locarno, benefited directly from the Gotthard railway.

In 1816, the special rights and title of the old mother church of San Vittore in Muralto went over to S. Antonio Abate. In 1863, snow collecting on the roof of the church caused the vault to collapse, killing 40 people. The citizens&#x27; collective or &quot;borghesi&quot; lacked the resources to repair the church. Therefore, in 1866, the ownership and maintenance of the churches of S. Antonio and S. Maria in Selva were given to the town as a whole. For financial reasons, the collapsed church was not completely repaired. Only the façade and central vault were rebuilt and the choir was expanded.

Between 1863 and &#x27;74, the church of San Francesco had to be used for services, and after 1798, the Assemblies of the neighbourhoods, the city and the county were held in the church. In 1814, the church of San Francesco was secularized and the Franciscans had to leave. The church and convent served from 1821 until 1827 as the State Government offices. From 1848 to 1863, the church was closed for worship, and in 1874 it was converted into a barracks and a salt storage. In 1924, it was converted back into a church and used by Benedictines for Catholic services delivered in the German language. The Jesuits took over this task from 1947 until 1992. The monastery was secularized in 1848, and after the 1893–94 renovation, it housed the first high school. Then in 1930, it was used for teacher training.

===Modern Locarno===
Between 1935 and &#x27;92, the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Eco di Locarno&quot; was printed in Locarno. In 1992, it merged with the official newspaper of the Liberal party &quot;Il dovere&quot; to create the daily newspaper &quot;La Regione&quot;. Since 1987, the only German language newspaper in Ticino, the &quot;Tessiner Zeitung&quot;, is published three times each week in Locarno.

===Madonna del Sasso, Cardada and Cimetta===
The sanctuary of Madonna del Sasso in Orselina above the city is the principal sight and goal of pilgrimage in the city.

<text>The Maggia is a river in the Swiss canton of Ticino.

The springs are near the Cristallina mountain at 8136 ft (2480 m). The river runs through the Val Sambuco, the Val Lavizzara, and the Valle Maggia, and enters Lago Maggiore between Ascona and Locarno. The village Maggia is situated on the river.

The river is used for hydroelectric power production, e.g. with the dams of Lago del Narèt and Lago del Sambuco near the sources.

The Maggia river is a popular scuba diving spot due to its crystal clear waters.

The name of the river derives from the name of the village Maggia.

In the 1990s the river had a European record: the river that grew fastest during rains. This characteristic led to many tragedies in the past. One involved the collapse of a bridge connecting the old Maggia to Aurigeno and Moghegno which killed many people in the 1970s.

<doc id="314340" wikidata="Q1030987" url="?curid=314340" title="Intervision Song Contest">
<text>The Intervision Song Contest (ISC) was an international song competition organised by the International Radio and Television Organisation. It was the Eastern Bloc equivalent to the Eurovision Song Contest. It was transmitted to national broadcasters via the Intervision network. The contest took place in Czechoslovakia, and in the Forest Opera in Sopot, Poland.

The ISC was organised from 1965 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1980. Since 1977, it replaced the Sopot International Song Festival (Sopot ISF) that had been held in Sopot since 1961. In 1981 the ISC/Sopot ISF was cancelled because of the rise of the independent trade union movement, Solidarity, which was judged by other Eastern bloc communist governments to be &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;. A revived contest took place in 2008, though subsequent editions planned to stage the contest again in both 2014 and 2015 did not materialise. After withdrew from the European Broadcasting Union upon being excluded from the Eurovision Song Contest 2022, another revival was announced by the Russian Ministry of Culture in 2023, with Russian president Vladimir Putin signing a decree for it to be held in Moscow later in 2025.

==History==
===1965–1968: The Czechoslovak era===
The first series of Intervision Song Contest, officially called Golden Clef Intervision Contest () ran from 1965 to 1968 in Czechoslovakia.

===1977–1980; 2008: The Polish Sopot era and fifth edition===

The first Sopot International Song Festival was initiated and organised in 1961 by Władysław Szpilman, assisted by Szymon Zakrzewski from Polish Artists Management (PAGART). The first three editions were held in the Gdańsk Shipyard hall (1961–1963), after which the festival moved to the Forest Opera (&quot;Opera Lesna&quot;). The main prize has been Amber Nightingale for most of its history.

Between 1977 and 1980 Sopot was replaced by the Intervision Song Contest, which was still held in Sopot. Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, the Sopot International Music Festival often changed its formulas to pick a winner and offered many different contests for its participants. For example, at the 4th Intervision Song Festival (held in Sopot 20–23 August 1980) two competitions were organised: one for artists representing television companies, the other for those representing record companies. In the first competition, the jury considered the artistic merits of the songs entered, while in the second, it judged the performers&#x27; interpretation. The festival has always been open to non-European acts, and countries like Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mongolia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa and many others have been represented in this event.

The contest lost popularity in Poland and abroad in the 1980s. TVP&#x27;s unconvincing attempts at organising several of the contests led to the authorities of Sopot giving the organisation of the 2005 Sopot International Song Festival to a private TV channel, TVN. Since 1999, there has been no contest. TVP chose to invite well-known artists instead, featuring the likes of Whitney Houston or The Corrs. In 2005, TVN was expected to bring the competition back. In 2006 TVN invited Elton John. The Sopot International Song Festival is usually considered bigger than the Benidorm International Song Festival because of its ability to attract star performers. In 2010 and 2011, the festival did not take place due to renovation of the Forest Opera. Since 2012, it has been called &quot;Sopot Top of the Top Festival&quot; and is broadcast annually by Polsat. The festival also provided opportunity to listen to international stars. It featured Charles Aznavour, Boney M, Johnny Cash, and more recently: Chuck Berry, Vanessa Mae, Annie Lennox, Vaya Con Dios, Chris Rea, Tanita Tikaram, La Toya Jackson, Whitney Houston, Kajagoogoo, as well as Goran Bregovic and Anastacia.

Eleven countries participated in the fifth edition in 2008, which was won by Tajikistan. In 2009, the then prime minister Vladimir Putin of Russia proposed restarting the competition, this time between Russia, China and the Central Asian member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

=== Revival attempts ===
In May 2014, it was announced that the contest would return, featuring countries from the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Russian singer and producer Igor Matvienko, announced that the revival of the Intervision Song Contest would take place in October 2014 in the coastal city of Sochi, which played host to the 2014 Winter Olympics. Seven countries had declared their interest to compete prior to the event&#x27;s cancellation: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China and Uzbekistan. Russia had also selected Alexander Ivanov as its representative. The contest was scheduled to take place in October 2014, ostensibly due to &quot;Russian anger at the moral decay of the West&quot;, particularly in response to the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 winner Conchita Wurst. Moreover, the revival was seen as part of &quot;Putin&#x27;s broader cultural diplomacy agenda&quot;. Despite plans to stage the contest in both 2014 and 2015, a revival has not taken place. Ivanov later represented Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 with the song &quot;Help You Fly&quot;, but failed to qualify for the final.

In November 2023, Russian Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova and Channel One Russia&#x27;s Director General Konstantin Ernst revealed at St. Petersburg&#x27;s International Cultural Forum that the broadcaster planned to produce a revival of the Intervision Song Contest featuring the member countries of BRICS. This occurred after the broadcaster&#x27;s membership in the European Broadcasting Union was suspended, upon the exclusion of Russia from the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 due to its invasion of Ukraine. On 8 June 2024, Russian government official Mikhail Shvydkoy told RIA Novosti that &quot;more than 16 countries&quot; would take part in the competition, naming Azerbaijan, Belarus, Brazil, China, Cuba, and Kazakhstan.

On 3 February 2025, now-president Putin signed a decree formalising the revival of the competition, which is scheduled to be held in the Moscow area later in 2025. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko was appointed as chair of the event&#x27;s organizing committee, while domestic policy chief Sergey Kiriyenko was installed as chair of its supervisory board. By then, more than 25 countries had shown interest.

==Participation==
The contest was formally open to members of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation and any countries of the former Soviet Union.

<doc id="314341" wikidata="Q626990" url="?curid=314341" title="Break-even point">
<text>The break-even point (BEP) in economics, business—and specifically cost accounting—is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, i.e. &quot;even&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, after all costs are paid for there is neither profit nor loss. In economics specifically, the term has a broader definition; even if there is no net loss or gain, and one has &quot;broken even&quot;, opportunity costs have been covered and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return. The break-even analysis was developed by Karl Bücher and Johann Friedrich Schär.

== Overview ==
The break-even point (BEP) or break-even level represents the sales amount—in either unit (quantity) or revenue (sales) terms—that is required to cover total costs, consisting of both fixed and variable costs to the company. Total profit at the break-even point is zero. It is only possible for a firm to pass the break-even point if the dollar value of sales is higher than the variable cost per unit. This means that the selling price of the goods must be higher than what the company paid for the good or its components for them to cover the initial price they paid (variable and fixed costs). Once they surpass the break-even price, the company can start making a profit.

The break-even point is one of the most commonly used concepts of financial analysis, and is not only limited to economic use, but can also be used by entrepreneurs, accountants, financial planners, managers and even marketers. Break-even points can be useful to all avenues of a business, as it allows employees to identify required outputs and work towards meeting these.

The break-even value is not a generic value as such and will vary dependent on the individual business. Some businesses may have a higher or lower break-even point. However, it is important that each business develop a break-even point calculation, as this will enable them to see the number of units they need to sell to cover their variable costs. Each sale will also make a contribution to the payment of fixed costs as well.

For example, a business that sells tables needs to make annual sales of 200 tables to break-even. At present the company is selling fewer than 200 tables and is therefore operating at a loss. As a business, they must consider increasing the number of tables they sell annually in order to make enough money to pay fixed and variable costs.

If the business does not think that they can sell the required number of units, they could consider the following options:

1. Reduce the fixed costs. This could be done through a number or negotiations, such as reductions in rent payments, or through better management of bills or other costs.

2. Reduce the variable costs, (which could be done by finding a new supplier that sells tables for less).

Either option can reduce the break-even point so the business need not sell as many tables as before, and could still pay fixed costs.

==Purpose==

The main purpose of break-even analysis is to determine the minimum output that must be exceeded for a business to profit. It also is a rough indicator of the earnings impact of a marketing activity. A firm can analyze ideal output levels to be knowledgeable on the amount of sales and revenue that would meet and surpass the break-even point. If a business doesn&#x27;t meet this level, it often becomes difficult to continue operation.

The break-even point is one of the simplest, yet least-used analytical tools. Identifying a break-even point helps provide a dynamic view of the relationships between sales, costs, and profits. For example, expressing break-even sales as a percentage of actual sales can help managers understand when to expect to break even (by linking the percent to when in the week or month this percent of sales might occur).

The break-even point is a special case of Target Income Sales, where Target Income is 0 (breaking even). This is very important for financial analysis. Any sales made past the breakeven point can be considered profit (after all initial costs have been paid)

Break-even analysis can also provide data that can be useful to the marketing department of a business as well, as it provides financial goals that the business can pass on to marketers so they can try to increase sales.

Break-even analysis can also help businesses see where they could re-structure or cut costs for optimum results. This may help the business become more effective and achieve higher returns. In many cases, if an entrepreneurial venture is seeking to get off of the ground and enter into a market it is advised that they formulate a break-even analysis to suggest to potential financial backers that the business has the potential to be viable and at what points.

==Construction==
In the linear Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis model (where marginal costs and marginal revenues are constant, among other assumptions), the break-even point (BEP) (in terms of Unit Sales (X)) can be directly computed in terms of Total Revenue (TR) and Total Costs (TC) as:
:formula_1
where:
* TFC is Total Fixed Costs,
* P is Unit Sale Price, and
* V is Unit Variable Cost.

The quantity, formula_2, is of interest in its own right, and is called the Unit Contribution Margin (C): it is the marginal profit per unit, or alternatively the portion of each sale that contributes to Fixed Costs. Thus the break-even point can be more simply computed as the point where Total Contribution = Total Fixed Cost:
:formula_3

To calculate the break-even point in terms of revenue (a.k.a. currency units, a.k.a. sales proceeds) instead of Unit Sales (X), the above calculation can be multiplied by Price, or, equivalently, the Contribution Margin Ratio (Unit Contribution Margin over Price) can be calculated:
:formula_4

:R=C,
Where R is revenue generated,
C is cost incurred i.e. 
Fixed costs + Variable Costs
or
:formula_5
or,
Break Even Analysis
:Q = TFC/c/s ratio = Break Even

===Margin of safety===
Margin of safety represents the strength of the business. It enables a business to know what is the exact amount it has gained or lost and whether they are over or below the break-even point. In break-even analysis, margin of safety is the extent by which actual or projected sales exceed the break-even sales.

:Margin of safety = (current output - breakeven output)

:Margin of safety% = (current output - breakeven output)/current output × 100

When dealing with budgets you would instead replace &quot;Current output&quot; with &quot;Budgeted output.&quot;
If P/V ratio is given then profit/PV ratio.

===Break-even analysis===
By inserting different prices into the formula, you will obtain a number of break-even points, one for each possible price charged. If the firm changes the selling price for its product, from $2 to $2.30, in the example above, then it would have to sell only 1000/(2.3 - 0.6)= 589 units to break even, rather than 715.

To make the results clearer, they can be graphed. To do this, draw the total cost curve (TC in the diagram), which shows the total cost associated with each possible level of output, the fixed cost curve (FC) which shows the costs that do not vary with output level, and finally the various total revenue lines (R1, R2, and R3), which show the total amount of revenue received at each output level, given the price you will be charging.

The break-even points (A,B,C) are the points of intersection between the total cost curve (TC) and a total revenue curve (R1, R2, or R3). The break-even quantity at each selling price can be read off the horizontal axis and the break-even price at each selling price can be read off the vertical axis. The total cost, total revenue, and fixed cost curves can each be constructed with simple formula. For example, the total revenue curve is simply the product of selling price times quantity for each output quantity. The data used in these formula come either from accounting records or from various estimation techniques such as regression analysis.

== Limitations ==
* The Break-even analysis is only a supply-side (i.e., costs only) analysis, as it tells you nothing about what sales are actually likely to be for the product at these various prices.
* It assumes that fixed costs (FC) are constant. Although this is true in the short run, an increase in the scale of production is likely to cause fixed costs to rise.
* It assumes average variable costs are constant per unit of output, at least in the range of likely quantities of sales. (i.e., linearity).
* It assumes that the quantity of goods produced is equal to the quantity of goods sold (i.e., there is no change in the quantity of goods held in inventory at the beginning of the period and the quantity of goods held in inventory at the end of the period).
* In multi-product companies, it assumes that the relative proportions of each product sold and produced are constant (i.e., the sales mix is constant).

<text>Valle Maggia (English, &quot;Maggia Valley&quot;) is an alpine valley in the Vallemaggia district of canton of Ticino, the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland. The valley is formed by the river Maggia and is situated between the Centovalli and Lago Maggiore as well as the Valle Verzasca in the East.

==Geography==
The Maggia valley has a spatial extension of , equal to one-fifth of the canton of Ticino. It is the largest valley of the canton and one of the widest within the Alps&#x27; south side. The valley is formed by the river Maggia, whose source is the Cristallina peak in Val Sambuco (Lavizzara). The river runs through the valley down to Ascona, where it pours into the Lake Maggiore.
The Maggia is fed by the rivers Melezza, Rovana (river) and Bavona, as well as other mountain streams, and can swell up to a current after torrential rains, even though its force has been regulated by numerous upstream dams and reservoirs. Over time, the river has flooded and eroded valuable areas of cultivation, partly due to extensive woodcutting, so the lower Maggia valley is broad, but it is flanked by steep granite walls.

The Maggia valley in its strict sense extends from Ponte Brolla in the South to Bignasco in the North.

Going North the first side valley is Northeast of the village of Maggia, the Valle del Salto. The next side valley is the short Valle di Lodano. The next tributary to the Maggia from the West is the Rovana which joins in Cevio. Upstream it forms the Val Rovana, which at Cerentino leads up into Valle di Bosco/Gurin and Valle di Campo.

The upper Maggia valley beyond Bignasco splits into two dead ends, the two major glacial troughs of Val Bavona in the West and Val Lavizzara in the East. The latter is, in turn, divided in the side valleys of Valle di Peccia in the West, Val di Prato in the East as cul-de sacs, and Val Sambuco. The side valley West of Val Bavona is the Val Canegia.

To the Southwest of the Maggia Valley are Valle Onsernone and Centovalli. Parallelling the Maggia Valley in the East is the Valle Verzasca.

The geographical configuration of the Maggia valley&#x27;s territory goes from above sea level of Ponte Brolla to above s.l. of the Basòdino peak, with a height difference equal to in just as the crow flies.

==Climate==
Because of its low altitude, temperatures are mild with a nearly Mediterranean climate, allowing palm trees to grow year round. Oaks and chestnuts grow up to an altitude of 1000 metres. Beyond 1000 metres, vegetation becomes more and more alpine and deciduous trees giving way to conifers and tundra plants.

==History==
Finds from the Copper Age prove that the valley was settled at least since then. During Roman times (late Latène and Augustan period) a sparse population was distributed in the entire Valley, probably oriented towards the Vicus Muralto. It is assumed that the valley&#x27;s cultural landscape of terraces, planting of chestnuts and walnut trees may have begun during Roman times.
The valley bottom was certainly populated by groups of Gauls (Maggia is a Gallic name) during the Iron Age. Roman tombs have been found in Avegno, Gordevio, Aurigeno, Moghegno, Cevio and Maggia.

During the Middle Ages the Longobards reached Locarno and started dominating the valley under the feudal government of Capitanei. It is in this period that Christianism spreads and the church of San Vittore in Muralto was founded. Thereafter Maggia, Sornico and Cevio became independent parishes. Gradually, the individual neighborhoods organized in larger units.

In the 14th century, Bignasco, Cavergno, Brontallo and Menzonio formed an administrative unit, as did the villages of Val Lavizzara and Val Rovana (Cevio, Cavergno, Campo, Cerentino and Bosco were the Roana Superior). In 1398, the Vallemaggia, the Verzasca Valley and Mergoscia refused to pay royalties to the Locarno nobility, who had fiefs in these regions; In 1403, the valleys formally separated from Locarno and founded an independent judicial district with a 42-member general council and own land law (statuti) centered in Cevio; various conflicts between the local valleys characterized their coexistence. In 1403/04, the dispute between the communities of the lower valley and Cevio ended with a contract. From 1411 to 1412, the Valley tried to evade the Duchy of Milan and joined the Savoyards. In 1416, the Confederates occupied the valley. They returned it to Milan in 1422 and finally to the Rusca family in 1439. Around 1430, the Lavizzaratal valley was legally separated from Valle Maggia.

In 1513, the Helvetians occupied the valley, and for the next 300 years, from 1513 to 1798, Vallemaggia was one of the bailiwicks of the twelve Helvetian cantons; its German name was &quot;Meiental&quot; or &quot;Mainthal&quot;. It was divided into the two valleys of Vallemaggia and Lavizzara, but only one fiscal head and one chief officiated and only for 2 years each; The latter chose his place of residence (in Cevio or Sornico) himself, but had to regularly reside in the other main town to assess the litigation, in difficult cases with the help of local judges. The Valle Lavizzara defended its self-reliance against Vallemaggia. It sabotaged the attempts of some of the bailiffs and of the annual accounts statute to settle the court centrally in Cevio or to overturn the directors.

When the Helvetian Republic was founded in 1798, the Valle Maggia became part of the Canton Lugano; In 1803, Napoleon gave the Republic a federal structure and Ticino became its own autonomous canton with Vallemaggia as its own district and Cevio as the capital.

In 1824, the first road to Bignasco is opened, in 1860 it is extended to the Valle Lavizzara, later in the Rovana until Cimalmotto in 1882, Valle Bosco after 1905 and Valle Peccia only between 1922 and 1924.

In the mid-19th century due to the storms in 1868, food shortage, economic hardship, and the gold rush many families emigrated to Australia and the Americas. Between 1840 and 1870 2000 people emigrated, manly men. Plinio Martini has described the harsh way of life in a novel called &quot;The Bottom of the Sack&quot;.

The villages of Lodano and Giumaglio have a combined population of around 200 people as compared to 500 in the 19th century.

==Dialect==
The Valmaggese dialect is part of the Lombard dialects’ family, also defined as Gallo-Italic. The background is Latin, with many Celtic elements; the dialect also presents Germanic influences, especially internalized during the Longobard rule and the Walser’s settlement in Bosco/Gurin.

==Human infrastructure, demographics, transportation==
The largest municipality is Maggia, at 323 metres altitude. Cevio at 418 metres is the former administrative centre and Bosco/Gurin at 1503 metres the only German speaking community in Ticino in the upper Valle di Bosco/Gurin. Bignasco at 443 metres is a village at the junction of Maggia and Bavona valley.

From the Middle Ages onwards people had emigrated to Locarno and the Sottoceneri. Population probably reached its peak in the middle of the 18th century, after which a first wave of bricklayers, stonemasons, grooms, traders and artists emigrated on a seasonal basis and for longer periods of time. This mitigated population pressure and enabled relative prosperity.

Around 1850, difficult economic conditions (customs unification after the creation of the Helvetian state, reprisals by the Austrian Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, deterioration of climatic conditions) caused seasonal or temporary up to final emigration to overseas, esp to California and Australia. The Maggia valley lost one-third of its total population. The ensuing strong depopulation of the valley and demographic imbalances (gender, aging, low fertility and high rates of singlehood) had long-term effects and triggered a further decline in agricultural productivity, which in turn led to new emigration. The most remote communities were the most affected. Only after the Second World War was there a gradual turnaround. However, the population development of the lower half of the valley, which benefited from its proximity to the economic center Locarno suburbanised in the last decades of the 20th century, much different from the more problematic development in the upper valleys. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Val Rovana, where the population had declined by 75% between 1860 and 1980, seemed to become a holiday resort, similar to the Val Bavona. The Valle Lavizzara was a little less affected by the population decline.
Within the Maggia valley there&#x27;s only 1,8% of the Ticinese population, even if it occupies 20% of the cantonal territory. The demographic density is, thus, very low: 9 inhabitants per square kilometre.

From 1814 to 1824 a road (via cantonale) was built from Locarno on the Lake Maggiore to Bignasco, which broke the valley&#x27;s isolation. In 1907, a railway line Locarno-Ponte Brolla-Bignasco was built. It helped the development of the quarries. The railroad was closed in 1965. Hydropower from Maggia began around 1950. It achieved great economic benefits however at the expense of environmental problems. 
As of 2010, there were nine power plants with a total production of about 611 megawatts. The creation of jobs slowed the rural exodus.

==Economy==
Since the Middle Ages, the economy has been based on field (cereals, potatoes and linen) and viticulture and pasture management. For many centuries cheese was exported from Valle Maggia. Forests were often overused as a resource, which polluted the environment. 
Crafts (wool spinning, weaving, wood processing), soapstone industry and after the second half of the 19th century quarries thrived, in which marble and a special form of gneiss (Beola) were obtained. 
Famous is the marble obtained from the quarry located at the end of Val di Peccia, at an altitude of 1300 metres. The marble of Peccia is a solid metamorphic limestone, weather-resistant and crystalline. It&#x27;s a high-quality product and it can be used both for constructions and sculpture. The marble industry of Peccia, born in 1946, has the most of its clientele in central Switzerland and northern European countries.

Since the 1970s, tourism has gained importance, with a strong increase in the number of second homes. The Maggia valley&#x27;s numerous infrastructures have led, especially, to the development of residential and hiking tourism. Skiing has a relevant importance, but this activity is mainly limited to Bosco/Gurin. 
The largest industries of the valley after tourism are stone quarrying and dairy production.

The hydroelectric industry Officine Idroelettriche della Maggia (OFIMA) is a large employer in the valley. It began with a concession to build the dam for the reservoir Lago del Sambuco on 10 March 1949. In the 1950s, the &quot;Maggia 1&quot; plants were built: Sambuco, Peccia, Cavergno and Verbano with concessions until 2035. In the 1960s the &quot;Maggia 2&quot; plants were built: Cavagnoli-Naret, Robiei and Bavona, the concessions of which expire in 2048.
The hydroelectric Officine produce 1265 GWh of energy on average per year, generating 50 million Francs and offering a hundred jobs. Mostly underground, the hydroelectric plants stretch for 60 kilometres, from the Gries basin in Canton Valais to Brissago, on the lake Maggiore.

<text>Alexandre Hardy (c. 1570/1572 – 1632) was a French dramatist, one of the most prolific of all time. He claimed to have written some six hundred plays, but only thirty-four are extant.

He was born in Paris, and seems to have been connected most his life with a troupe of actors (the &quot;Comédiens du Roi&quot;) headed by the actor named Valleran Lecomte, whom he provided with plays; Hardy may have toured the provinces and even acted with this company (his participation with this troupe is attested from 1611, but may have begun far earlier). Valleran Lecomte&#x27;s troupe gave performances in Paris from 1598 to 1600 at the Hôtel de Bourgogne, and again from 1606 to 1612. At the death of Valleran, the troupe was headed by the actor Bellerose (Pierre Le Messier), and the troupe would gain exclusive rights to the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1629. Because of his difficult relations with Bellerose, in 1627 Hardy started writing for a rival troupe of actors (the &quot;Vieux Comédiens du Roi&quot;) around Claude Deschamps which performed at the Théâtre du Marais.

Hardy&#x27;s numerous dedications never seem to have brought him riches or even patrons. His most powerful friend was Isaac de Laffemas (d. 1657), one of Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s most unscrupulous agents, and he was on friendly terms with the poet Théophile de Viau, who addressed him in some verses placed at the head of his &quot;Théâtre&quot; (1632), and Tristan l&#x27;Hermite had a similar admiration for him. Hardy&#x27;s plays were written for the stage, not to be read; and it was in the interest of the company that they should not be printed and thus fall into the common stock. Hardy wrote quickly, often adapting plays from French, foreign and classical sources (Ovid, Lucian, Plutarch, Xenophon, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Josephus, Miguel de Cervantes, Jorge de Montemayor, Boccaccio, François de Rosset).

In 1623 Hardy published &quot;les Chastes et Loyales Amours de Théagène et Chariclée&quot;, a tragicomedy in eight &quot;days&quot; or &quot;dramatic poems&quot;, and in 1624 he began a collected edition of his works, &quot;Le Théâtre d&#x27;Alexandre Hardy, parisien&quot;, of which five volumes (1624–1628) were published, one at Rouen and the rest in Paris.

Hardy&#x27;s extant plays are as follows:

Twelve tragedies:
* &quot;Didon se sacrifiant&quot; - the suicide of Dido
* &quot;Scédase ou l&#x27;Hospitalité violée&quot; - drawn from Plutarch: two young nobles of Sparta rape and kill two girls of the country while the girls&#x27; father is away; their father is unable to obtain justice and commits suicide.
* &quot;Panthée&quot;
* &quot;Méléagre&quot;
* &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Achille&quot; - the death of Achilles
* &quot;Coriolan&quot; - the story of Coriolanus
* &quot;Mariane&quot;
* &quot;La Mort de Daire&quot; - the death of Darius
* &quot;La Mort d&#x27;Alexandre&quot; - the death of Alexander the Great
* &quot;Timoclée ou la Juste Vengeance&quot;
* &quot;Lucrèce&quot; - drawn from Lope de Vega: a married man learns that his wife is committing adultery from the courtesan of her lover, and he kills his wife and rival, but is himself killed.
* &quot;Alcméon ou la Vengeance féminine&quot; - an adultery leads to murder.

Four plays variously listed as tragedies or tragicomedies:
* &quot;Procris ou la Jalousie infortunée&quot; - the story of Procris
* &quot;Alceste ou la Fidélité&quot;
* &quot;Ariadne ravie&quot; - the story of Ariadne&#x27;s kidnapping by Theseus.
* &quot;Aristoclée&quot;

Ten tragicomedies::
* &quot;Arsacome&quot;
* &quot;Dorise&quot;
* &quot;Frégonde&quot;
* &quot;Elmire ou l&#x27;Heureuse Bigamie&quot;
* &quot;Gésippe&quot; - drawn from Boccaccio: a young man has his friend replace him in the marriage bed.
* &quot;Phraarte&quot; - drawn from the translation of Giovanni Battista Giraldi&#x27;s &quot;Cent excellentes nouvelles&quot; (Paris, 1583)
* &quot;Cornélie&quot;
* &quot;La Force du sang&quot; - drawn from Miguel de Cervantes: a girl is raped anonymously by a young noble in Toledo and she gives birth to a son; seven years later this son is recognized by the young noble&#x27;s family and the couple is married.
* &quot;Félismène&quot; - drawn from a Spanish source
* &quot;La Belle Egyptienne&quot; - drawn from a Spanish source

Three &quot;dramatic poems&quot;:
* &quot;Les Chastes et Loyales Amours de Théagène et Chariclée&quot; - based on the ancient Greek novel by Heliodorus of Emesa.
* &quot;Le Ravissement de Proserpine par Pluton&quot; - the story of Prosperpina kidnapped by Pluto.
* &quot;La Gigantomachie&quot;

Five pastorals:
* &quot;Alphée, ou la justice d&#x27;amour&quot; (considered the best of his pastorals)
* &quot;Alcée&quot;
* &quot;Corinne&quot;
* &quot;Le Triomphe d&#x27;Amour&quot;
* &quot;L&#x27;Amour victorieux ou vengé&quot;

The titles of twelve more of Hardy&#x27;s plays are also known.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (paraphrasing), Hardy&#x27;s importance in the history of the French theatre has been frequently overlooked. Up to the end of the sixteenth century medieval farce and spectacle dominated the popular stage in Paris. The French Renaissance tragedy of Étienne Jodelle and his followers had been written for the learned, and in 1628 when Hardy&#x27;s work was nearly over and Jean Rotrou and Jean Mairet were on the threshold of their careers, very few literary dramas by any other author other than Robert Garnier and Antoine de Montchrestien are known to have been produced.

Hardy educated the popular taste, and made possible the dramatic activity of the seventeenth century. He had abundant practical experience of the stage, and modified tragedy accordingly, maintaining five acts in verse, but suppressing the chorus (except in his earliest plays), limiting monologues (although monologues reappear in his later plays), and providing the action and variety which was denied to the lyrical drama of the Renaissance. He was a popularizer of the tragicomedy. His tragedies are close to the Senecan model (although at times they echo medieval morality plays), but Hardy was unconcerned with Renaissance or classical dramatic theory (Aristotle, Horace), the three unities (Hardy&#x27;s plays feature many locations and extend past 24 hours) or the rules of &quot;bienséance&quot; (his plays openly portray rape and murder and often feature non-noble characters). Hardy&#x27;s verse style is sometimes convoluted and awkward and he shows a certain love of rare or erudite words (both of these stylistic habits would be condemned by François de Malherbe in the same period); for these reasons later critics have called Hardy unreadable. It is impossible to know how much the dramatists of the seventeenth century were indebted to him in detail, since only a fraction of his work is preserved, but generally Hardy may be credited with developing a French theater of action. He died in 1632 of the plague.

<text>A plantar wart is a wart occurring on the bottom of the foot or toes. Its color is typically similar to that of the skin. Small black dots often occur on the surface. One or more may occur in an area. They may result in pain with pressure such that walking is difficult.
They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). A break in the skin is required for infection to occur. Risk factors include use of communal showers, having had prior warts, and poor immune function. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.
Treatment is only needed if it is causing symptoms. This may include salicylic acid, cryotherapy, chemo-based fluorouracil or bleomycin, and surgical removal. The skin atop the lesion should generally be removed before treatment. In about a third to two-thirds of cases, they go away without specific treatment, but this may take a few years. Plantar warts are common. Children and young adults are most often affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
Their colors are typically similar to that of the nearby skin. Small, black dots may occur on their surfaces. One or more may occur in an area. They may result in pain with pressure such that walking may be difficult.
==Cause==
Plantar warts are benign epithelial tumors generally caused by infection by human papillomavirus types 1, 2, 4, 60, or 63, but also by types 57, 65, 66, and 156. These types are classified as clinical (visible symptoms). The virus attacks compromised skin through direct contact, possibly entering through tiny cuts and abrasions in the stratum corneum (outermost layer of skin). After infection, warts may not become visible for several weeks or months. Because of pressure on the sole of the foot or finger, the wart is pushed inward and a layer of hard skin may form over the wart. A plantar wart can be painful if left untreated.

Warts may spread through autoinoculation, by infecting nearby skin, or by contaminated walking surfaces. They may fuse or develop into clusters called mosaic warts.

==Diagnosis==
A plantar wart is a small lesion that appears on the surface of the skin and typically resembles a cauliflower, with tiny black petechiae (tiny hemorrhages under the skin) in the center. Pinpoint bleeding may occur when these are scratched. Plantar warts occur on the soles of feet and toes. They may be painful when standing or walking.

Plantar warts are often similar to calluses or corns, but can be differentiated by close observation of skin striations. Feet are covered in friction ridges, which are akin to fingerprints of the feet. Friction ridges are disrupted by plantar warts; if the lesion is not a plantar wart, the striations continue across the top layer of the skin. Plantar warts tend to be painful on application of pressure from either side of the lesion rather than direct pressure, unlike corns (which tend to be painful on direct pressure, instead).

==Prevention==
HPV is spread by direct and indirect contact from an infected host. Avoiding direct contact with contaminated surfaces such as communal changing rooms and shower floors and benches, avoiding sharing of shoes and socks and avoiding contact with warts on other parts of the body and on the bodies of others may help reduce the spread of infection. Infection is less common among adults than children.

As all warts are contagious, precautions should be taken to avoid spreading them. Recommendations include:
* Cover them with an adhesive bandage while swimming
* Wear latex swimming socks
* Wear flip-flops when using communal showers
* Do not share towels.

Plantar warts are not prevented by inoculation with HPV vaccines because the warts are caused by different strains of HPV. Gardasil protects against strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, and Cervarix protects against 16 and 18, whereas plantar warts are caused by strains 1, 2, 4, and 63.

==Treatment==

A number of treatments have been found to be effective. A 2012 review of different treatments for skin warts in otherwise healthy people concluded modest benefit from salicylic acid, and cryotherapy appears similar to salicylic acid.

===Medications===
Salicylic acid, the treatment of warts by keratolysis, involves the peeling away of dead surface skin cells with keratolytic chemicals such as salicylic acid or trichloroacetic acid. These are available in over-the-counter products, but in higher concentrations may need to be prescribed by a physician. A 12-week daily treatment with salicylic acid has been shown to lead to a complete clearance of warts in 10–15% of the cases.

Formic acid, topical, is a common treatment for plantar warts, which works by being applied over a period of time, causing the body to reject the wart.

Fluorouracil cream, a chemotherapy agent sometimes used to treat skin cancer, can be used on particularly resistant warts, by blocking viral DNA and RNA production and repair.

Bleomycin, a more potent chemotherapy drug, can be injected into deep warts, destroying the viral DNA or RNA. Bleomycin is notably not US FDA approved for this purpose. Possible side effects include necrosis of the digits, nail loss, and Raynaud syndrome. The usual treatment is one or two injections.

Immunotherapy, as intralesional injection of antigens (mumps, &quot;candida&quot; or trichophytin antigens USP), is a wart treatment that may trigger a host immune response to the wart virus, resulting in wart resolution. It is now recommended as a second-line therapy.

===Surgery===

Liquid nitrogen and similar cryosurgery methods are common surgical treatments, which act by freezing the external cell structure of the warts, destroying the live tissue.

Electrodesiccation and surgical excision may produce scarring.

Laser surgery is generally a last resort treatment, as it is expensive and painful, but may be necessary for large, hard-to-cure warts.

Cauterization may be effective as a prolonged treatment. As a short-term treatment, cauterization of the base with anesthetic can be effective, but this method risks scarring or keloids. Subsequent surgical removal, if necessary, also risks keloids and/or recurrence in the operative scar.

<text>Giovanni Battista Giraldi (November 1504 – 30 December 1573) was an Italian novelist and poet. He appended the nickname Cinthio to his name and is commonly referred to by that name (which is also rendered as Cynthius, Cintio or, in Italian, Cinzio).

==Biography==
Cinthio was born in Ferrara, then the capital of the Duchy of Ferrara, and educated at the University of Ferrara. In 1525, he became a professor of natural philosophy there. Twelve years later, he succeeded Celio Calcagnini in the chair of &quot;belles-lettres&quot;.

Between 1542 and 1560 he was a private secretary, first to Ercole II and afterwards to Alfonso II d&#x27;Este; but having, in connection with a literary quarrel, lost the favour of his patron, he moved to Mondovì, where he remained as a teacher of literature until 1568. Subsequently, on the invitation of the senate of Milan, he occupied the chair of rhetoric at Pavia until 1573, when, in search of health, he returned to Ferrara, where he later died.

Besides an epic entitled &quot;Ercole&quot; (1557), in twenty-six cantos, Cinthio wrote nine tragedies, the best known of which, &quot;Orbecche&quot;, was produced in 1541. The bloodthirsty nature of the play, and its style, are, in the opinion of many of its critics, almost redeemed by occasional bursts of genuine and impassioned poetry.

His literary work was ideologically influenced by the Catholic Reformation. In the theatrical works there appears a vein of experimentation that anticipates some typical elements of taste of the modern European theatre, for example the Elizabethan theatre and baroque styles, where psychological violence and horror are used in function and dramatic action structured in real time.

Among the prose works of Cinthio is the &quot;Hecatommithi&quot; or &quot;Gli Ecatommiti&quot;, a collection of tales told somewhat after the manner of Boccaccio, but still more closely resembling the novels of Cinthio&#x27;s contemporary, Matteo Bandello. Something may be said in favour of their professed claim to represent a higher standard of morality. Originally published at Mondovì in 1565, they were frequently reprinted in Italy, while a French translation appeared in 1583 and one in Spanish, with 20 of the stories, in 1590. They have a peculiar interest to students of English literature, for providing the plots of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;. That of the latter, which is to be found in the &quot;Hecatommithi&quot;, was almost certainly read by Shakespeare in the original Italian; while that of the former is probably to be traced to George Whetstone&#x27;s &quot;Promos and Cassandra&quot; (1578), an adaptation of Cinthio&#x27;s story, and to his &quot;Heptamerone&quot; (1582), which contains a direct English translation. To Cinthio also must be attributed the plot of Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Custom of the Country&quot;.

<doc id="314351" wikidata="Q1507136" url="?curid=314351" title="George Cole (actor)">
<text>George Edward Cole OBE (22 April 1925 – 5 August 2015) was an English actor whose career spanned 75 years. He was best known for playing Arthur Daley in the long-running ITV comedy-drama show &quot;Minder&quot; and Flash Harry in the early &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; films.

==Early life==
Cole was born in Tooting, south London. He was placed for adoption at ten days of age and adopted by George and Florence Cole, who lived in Tooting, moving five miles away to a council flat in Morden when Cole was five years old. The senior George suffered from epilepsy, a double hernia, and the after-effects of gas poisoning during the First World War; he had several jobs which were curtailed by his ill-health, including the pulling of a heavy roller for Tooting council, which exertion in Cole&#x27;s opinion contributed to his father&#x27;s death. He attended secondary school in nearby Morden. He left school at 14 to be a butcher&#x27;s boy and had an ambition to join the Merchant Navy, but landed a part in a touring musical and chose acting as a career. He recalled during that year (1939) he was in Dublin on the day of Britain&#x27;s entry into World War II when he witnessed an effigy of Neville Chamberlain being publicly burned without interference from the local police.

==Career==
Aged 15, Cole was cast in the film &quot;Cottage to Let&quot; (1941) opposite Scottish actor Alastair Sim. Sim liked Cole, and agreed with his family to take in Cole and his mother to their home. Acting as his mentor, Sim helped Cole lose his Cockney accent; Cole stayed with the Sim family until he was 27. He later attributed his career success to Sim, with whom he appeared in a total of 11 films, ending with a filmed version for television of &quot;The Anatomist&quot; (1956), from the play by James Bridie. 

Cole also acted opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Demi-Paradise&quot; (1943) and Olivier&#x27;s film version of &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), of which he was the last surviving cast member. Cole&#x27;s career was interrupted by his national service in the Royal Air Force from 1944 to 1947, where he was temporarily a radio operator.

Returning to his acting career, he became familiar to audiences in British comedy films in the 1950s. Cole appeared with Alastair Sim in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (as the young Scrooge) in 1951, including a scene with fellow actor Patrick Macnee who played the young Jacob Marley. His best known film role was as &quot;Flash Harry&quot; in the &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; films, and in the comedy &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot; (1959). He also starred in the film &quot;Take Me High&quot; (1973) alongside Cliff Richard and Deborah Watling. Cole was also known for his lead role in the radio comedy &quot;A Life of Bliss&quot; (1953–69), in which he played an amiable but bumbling bachelor, David Alexander Bliss, (initially played by David Tomlinson); it lasted for six series and 118 episodes. It became a TV series in 1960, running for two series, but no recordings of the TV episodes are known to survive.

&quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh&quot; (1963) is a three-part serial which formed part of the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; TV series. It was shot on location in England and stars Patrick McGoohan as Doctor Syn, with Cole as Mipps.

In 1964, Cole guest-starred as &#x27;Bishop&#x27;, an increasingly deranged arsonist, in the episode &quot;Firebug&quot; in the ITV series &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;. In 1968, he starred as Max Osborne in the TV series &quot;A Man of Our Times&quot;.

Cole appeared as a guest role in the Gerry Anderson produced television series &quot;UFO&quot; in the episode &quot;Flight Path&quot; (1971), and he appeared as a storyteller on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;, narrating in six episodes between 1969 and 1971. He also made a guest appearance as Mr Downs, a bank manager, in a 1978 episode of the sitcom &quot;The Good Life&quot;, performed in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II.

His best-remembered television role was as the crafty wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley in the popular and successful Thames Television series &quot;Minder&quot;, which he played from 1979 to the show&#x27;s conclusion in 1994. Prior to this, he had played a struggling writer in the BBC sitcom &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget To Write!&quot; (1977–79).
Although he is most associated with the character of Arthur Daley, it was one which produced mixed emotions in him, describing variously his support for the character as well as citing in his autobiography how much he loathed the type of person Daley was.

Cole also played Sir Giles Lynchwood in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of the Tom Sharpe novel &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot; (1985). Cole starred in a number of comedies, such as &quot;The Bounder&quot; (1982–83), &quot;Comrade Dad&quot; (1984–86), &quot;Dad&quot; (1997–99) and &quot;My Good Friend&quot; (1995–96).

Cole appeared in a &quot;New Tricks&quot; (BBC), series 4 Episode 5 &quot;Powerhouse&quot; (2007) and the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot; (2008).

==Personal life==
Cole was married twice, first to actress Eileen Moore (b. 1932) from 1954 until 1962 (when they divorced), and then to actress Penny Morrell from 1967 until his death. Cole had four children, two from each marriage. His son from his first marriage, Cris Cole, is a screenwriter for film and television.

He was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992. He resided for over 70 years in Stoke Row, Oxfordshire. His autobiography &quot;The World Was My Lobster&quot;, a phrase taken from an episode of &quot;Minder&quot; that made George smile, was published in 2013. 

===Death===
On 5 August 2015, Cole died from pneumonia and sepsis at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, aged 90. His funeral took place at Reading Crematorium on 13 August. The &quot;Minder&quot; theme song was played and Cole&#x27;s &quot;Minder&quot; co-star Dennis Waterman gave a eulogy.

George Cole is often mistakenly credited for performing in the American films &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (1974), &quot;Double Nickels&quot; (1977) and &quot;Deadline Auto Theft&quot; (1983). There was indeed an actor named George Cole performing in these films but it was categorically not the subject of this Wikipedia entry. Cole wrote in his autobiography that &quot;it is easy to spot that it was not (me)&quot; because the actor playing in them is African American!

<text>The Epping to Chatswood rail link (ECRL) (originally a part of the Parramatta Rail Link (PRL) proposal) is a railway line in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, which connects Epping station on the Northern line with Chatswood on the North Shore line. It was formerly considered its own railway line, but is now part of the Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line.

The line runs completely underground and includes three intermediate stations: Macquarie University, Macquarie Park and North Ryde. The junction stations at Epping and Chatswood both underwent major redevelopments to incorporate the new link.

As a suburban line, it was in service for less than a decade, opening in February 2009 and closing in September 2018 for conversion. The vast majority of the infrastructure was incorporated into the Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line of the Sydney Metro network. The conversion took place as part of the Sydney Metro Northwest project.

==Earlier proposals==
There were proposals for a railway between Sydney&#x27;s North Shore and the Main Northern lines since September 1920, when John Bradfield&#x27;s plans were put forward for a railway between St Leonards and Eastwood. The proposed route was via the present Parklands Avenue in Lane Cove to the head of Burns Bay, across the Lane Cove River near the present-day public school at North Ryde, and terminated about north of Eastwood station. After political moves, and potential engineering difficulties with hills south of Eastwood station in the 1930s, the terminus was changed to Epping, where the line became known as the &quot;Epping-St Leonards Railway&quot;. To this end, the State Government resumed several of the estate houses in Epping around the present-day Brigg and Albuera Roads for a track to loop the line into the main line and terminate the trains at Epping. When voters in neighbouring Eastwood then complained, the line was proposed to link south of Eastwood, use island platforms at Eastwood and then link to Epping.

In 1929, local real estate agents promoted land sales along the railway line at Epping in preparation for the construction of the line. They called the area &quot;Epping Junction&quot;, on account of the station being a junction between the Epping-St Leonards Line and the Main Northern Line. A new island platform was also built in preparation for the terminus of the new line. The track was to be in the middle of the two Main Northern line platforms, and until the 1970s still existed as a terminating line.

The effects of the Great Depression, however, soon meant that the line would not be economically feasible, and despite protests by local residents and the local member, Major Shand, the project was abandoned. In its place, a road was built between St Leonards and Epping, which is the current Epping Road. The land sales were a complete failure, and the lots around the railway were not sold until the 1950s and 1960s.

It was not until the 1990s that plans for the line were resurrected. An original proposal to run from Westmead to St Leonards, via Epping was considered, but in 1998 the Parramatta Rail Link was announced as part of the NSW Government&#x27;s Action for Transport 2010 plan. The line was to run from Chatswood through Epping to Parramatta, partially travelling along the underutilised Carlingford surface line which would be expanded from single-track to dual-track. This proposal included optional stations at Delhi Road and UTS Kuring-gai and would be served by eight services an hour. Construction was planned to commence in late 1999, with the line to open in 2006.

== Construction ==

Construction of the PRL began with the Chatswood to Epping section, which commenced in November 2002.

In August 2003, the NSW Transport Minister, Michael Costa, announced that the Epping-Parramatta section would be postponed indefinitely. The delaying of this section was justified on the grounds that the expected daily patronage of 15,000 passenger trips did not justify the project&#x27;s $1.2 billion cost. The government feared that the line would be under-utilised, much as the Airport Link (a public-private project) had been. There also had been community protest against the routing of the line through Parramatta Park (one of three possible routes supplied by the government). The government later announced the construction of a passing loop as part of the Rail Clearways Program on the Carlingford line, which would have allowed a half-hourly frequency all day, however this project was cancelled in November 2008.

Originally, there was to be a bridge over the Lane Cove River, instead of a tunnel beneath it, but the government adopted the tunnel option due to community and environmentalist pressure. This required the elimination of the planned station at the University of Technology, Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Campus; the required increased depth of the tunnel to go under the river made a station at that point impractical, due to the required depth of the escalator shafts.

Thiess and Hochtief delivered the project as a joint venture which included the design and construction of a driven railway and four fully mined stations. The line consists of two tunnels – one for each track. The tunnels were constructed using two tunnel boring machines, with a section underneath the Lane Cove River being constructed by the cut and cover method (next to where Delhi Road crosses the River). The line is fully bi-directional, with three crossovers to allow trains to switch tracks in the event of a disruption. The tunnels include a walkway on one side, at platform height.

Several associated works were also completed to coincide with the opening of the new line. These include the rebuilt Chatswood interchange, a major upgrade at Epping, an upgrade of North Sydney station, the Hornsby turnback Rail Clearways project and new substations at Waverton and Beecroft.

===Issues===
In December 2007, it was announced that Tangara trains would not be running on the line due to steepness of the tunnel. The line owner, RailCorp, denied that was is an engineering bungle, saying &quot;The Tangara trains, because they are not ideally suited to that steep gradient, will not be allocated to that line even though they can operate.&quot; S set trains were also excluded, due to concerns over possible problems performing &quot;push-out&quot; duty (a loaded train pushing out another loaded train) on the gradients. In February 2008 it was revealed that mats, connected to the rail tracks and concrete slabs to reduce noise, had separated and needed to be replaced, with at least half of the of track to be re-laid. On 23 October 2008 it was also confirmed during testing that sound levels on the train were 90 decibels, as loud as a 737 plane coming into land. Plans to rectify this would come at a cost that has already blown out from $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion.
In July 2009 it was reported that drivers were being restricted to two return shuttle runs through the tunnel before taking a break as well being instructed to keep the lights on in the driver&#x27;s cabin and lower the side window blinds in order to avoid a possible stroboscopic effect caused by the tunnel lighting, with claims it may have caused headaches, dizziness, fatigue and nausea.

== Initial service ==

The line opened on 23 February 2009 as a shuttle service between Epping and Chatswood. The launch was moved from 22 February due to a National Day of Mourning for the victims of Victoria&#x27;s Black Saturday bushfires. The line operated free of charge until 8 June 2009. Initially passengers could use a blue Complementary Pass, or buy a ticket to either Chatswood or Epping if coming from outside the new link. Later on, the automatic gates at the new stations were switched on and passengers were required to &quot;buy&quot; a ticket as usual. A portion of the fare was automatically deducted for passengers travelling to or from stations beyond the new link.

OSCARS (Outer Suburban Cars), were used on the shuttle service, running as four-car sets. These were the newest trains in the fleet and are intended for longer journeys out of the Sydney basin, but were used on the ECRL due to the steepness and noisiness of the tunnel. Other types maintained at Hornsby Maintenance Depot were not used during the shuttle phase, though tests with K sets proved successful. Trains operated at 15-minute intervals, with the last service departing Epping at 9:31 pm. The line was coloured black on CityRail maps and publicity materials during the shuttle period, which ended on 11 October 2009 when a new timetable was introduced.

== Integrated service ==

Once integrated services commenced, the link became part of the Northern Line. Most Northern Line trains from Hornsby to Epping operated via the new link and then continued along the North Shore Line from Chatswood to the city, before returning to Epping via Strathfield. Trains reversed at Epping&#x27;s above ground platforms, and followed the opposite route back to Hornsby. Services were operated by K sets, with some OSCARS used during off-peak periods. The timetable had four trains per hour on weekdays between Hornsby and the City via the ECRL. On weekends, 4 trains per hour ran between Hornsby and Chatswood with two of these continuing from Chatswood to the city, and then to Epping via Strathfield.

On 20 October 2013, the Northern Line was replaced by the North Shore, Northern &amp; Western Line. On weekdays, this saw the ECRL served by trains running from Hornsby to Richmond or Emu Plains. On weekends, the Hornsby to Epping loop was retained.

The ECRL was also used by Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line services if the Main North Line between Strathfield and Epping was affected by trackwork or a major service interruption.

==Conversion to Sydney Metro==
In February 2010, the New South Wales Government re-announced the North West Rail Link as a branch of Sydney&#x27;s existing double-deck heavy rail system, connected with the ECRL at Epping.

On 11 August 2010, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced $2.1 billion in funding for the Epping to Parramatta Rail Link with $520 million to be contributed by the NSW Government. (a revisit of the 1998 NSW Government announcement, which despite a detailed report in 2003 was abandoned earlier in 2010 by the NSW Keneally Government). Work on the line was expected to begin in 2011 and the line was scheduled to be operational by 2017. The state opposition indicated it wished to instead use the federal money to construct the North West Rail Link, should it win the March 2011 state election. The federal government did not support this proposal and said the money should be used to construct the line to Parramatta as it originally proposed. Following the defeat of the Keneally Government in 2011, the proposal was abandoned.

The new O&#x27;Farrell Government continued planning for the North West Rail Link. In 2012, it was announced that the project would adopt different technology from Sydney&#x27;s existing rail system, instead running single-deck automated trains with platform screen doors. The North West Rail Link project – renamed Sydney Metro Northwest – involved the conversion of the existing Epping to Chatswood section to form part of the new Sydney Metro network and allow the new, automated line to run as a shuttle between Tallawong and Chatswood.

The ECRL closed on 29 September 2018 to allow conversion to commence. The conversion of the former ECRL took eight months; temporary bus services were provided during this time. The Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line, including the five former ECRL stations, opened on 26 May 2019. The former Northern line route from Hornsby to Central via Strathfield was reinstated, and North Shore services that ran on the rail link were amended to operate beyond Chatswood towards Gordon, Hornsby or Berowra.

<text>George Whetstone (1544? – 1587) was an English dramatist and author.

==Biography==
Whetstone was the third son of Robert Whetstone (d. 1557), a member of a wealthy family that owned the manor of Walcot at Barnack, near Stamford, Lincolnshire. George appears to have had a small inheritance which he soon spent, and he complains bitterly of the failure of a lawsuit to recover a further inheritance of which he had been unjustly deprived. In 1572 he joined an English regiment on active service in the Low Countries, where he met George Gascoigne and Thomas Churchyard. Gascoigne was his guest at Walcot when he died in 1577, and Whetstone commemorated his friend in a long elegy.

Whetstone&#x27;s first published work, the &quot;Rocke of Regard&quot; (1576), consisted of tales in prose and verse adapted from the Italian, and in 1578 he published &quot;The right, excellent and famous Historye of Promos and Cassandra&quot;, a play in two parts, drawn from the eighty-fifth novel of Giraldi Cinthio&#x27;s &quot;Hecatomithi&quot;. To this he wrote an interesting preface addressed to William Fleetwood, recorder of London, to whom he claimed to be related, in which he criticizes contemporary drama.

In 1582 Whetstone published his &quot;Heptameron of Civil Discourses&quot;, a collection of tales which includes &quot;The Rare Historie of Promos and Cassandra&quot;. From this prose version William Shakespeare apparently drew the plot of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, though he was probably familiar with the story in its earlier dramatic form. (Shakespeare probably used another Whetstone book for his &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;). Whetstone accompanied Sir Humphrey Gilbert on his expedition in 1578–1579, and the next year found him in Italy.

The Puritan spirit was now widespread in England, and Whetstone followed its dictates in his prose tract &quot;A Mirour for Magestrates&quot; (1584), which in a second edition was called &quot;A Touchstone for the Time&quot;. Rather than abusing the stage as some Puritan writers did, he merely objected to the performance of plays on Sundays.

In 1585 Whetstone returned to the army in the Netherlands, and was present at the Battle of Zutphen (1586). His other works are a collection of military anecdotes entitled &quot;The Honourable Reputation of a Souldier&quot; (1585); a political tract, the &quot;English Myrror&quot; (1586), numerous elegies on distinguished persons, and &quot;The Censure of a Loyall Subject&quot; (1587). No information about Whetstone is available after the publication of this last book, and it was conjectured that he died shortly afterwards. Papers in State Papers Holland show Whetstone was killed in a duel outside Bergen op Zoom in 1587.

<text>West Java (, , Pegon: جاوا كولون) is an Indonesian province on the western part of the island of Java, with its provincial capital in Bandung. West Java is bordered by the province of Banten and the country&#x27;s capital region of Jakarta to the west, the Java Sea to the north, the province of Central Java to the east and the Indian Ocean to the south. With Banten, this province is the native homeland of the Sundanese people, the second-largest ethnic group in Indonesia.

West Java was one of the first eight provinces of Indonesia formed following the country&#x27;s independence proclamation and was later legally re-established on 14 July 1950. In 1966, the city of Jakarta was split off from West Java as a &#x27;special capital region&#x27; (), with a status equivalent to that of a province, while in 2000 the western parts of the province were in turn split away to form a separate Banten province.

Even following these split-offs, West Java is by far the most populous province of Indonesia with a population of 48,274,162 as of the 2020 Census, which grew to 49,860,330 at mid 2023 according to the official estimates; the population continues to grew and surpassed the 50 millions milestone during late 2023. The province&#x27;s largest cities, Bekasi (a satellite city within the Jakarta metropolitan area), Bandung and Depok (the latter also within the Jakarta metropolitan area), are the third, fourth and sixth most populous cities in Indonesia respectively. Bandung is also one of the most densely populated cities proper in the world.

== History ==
The oldest human inhabitant archaeological findings in the region were unearthed in Anyer on the western coast of Java with evidence of bronze and iron metallurgical culture dating to the first millennium AD. The prehistoric Buni culture, near present-day Bekasi, developed clay pottery with evidence found in Anyer to Cirebon. Artefacts dated 400 BC — AD 100, such as food and drink containers, were found mostly as burial gifts. There is archaeological evidence in Batujaya Archaeological Site dating from the 2nd century and, according to Dr Tony Djubiantono, the head of Bandung Archaeology Agency, Jiwa Temple in Batujaya, Karawang, was also built around this time.

One of the earliest known recorded histories in Indonesia is from the former Tarumanagara kingdom, where seven, fourth-century stones are inscribed in Wengi letters (used in the Pallava period) and in Sanskrit describing the kings of the kingdom of Tarumanagara. Records of Tarumanegara lasted until the sixth century, which coincides with the attack of Srivijaya, as stated in the Kota Kapur inscription (AD 686).

The Sunda Kingdom subsequently became the ruling power of the region, as recorded on the Kebon Kopi II inscription (AD 932).

An Ulama, Sunan Gunung Jati, settled in Cirebon, intending to spread Islam in the town. Meanwhile, the Sultanate of Demak in Central Java grew to become a threat to the Sunda kingdom. To defend against the threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa signed the Luso-Sundanese Treaty with the Portuguese in 1512. In return, the Portuguese were granted access to build fortresses and warehouses in the area, as well as forming trading agreements with the kingdom. This first international treaty of Sunda Kingdom with the Europeans was commemorated by the placement of the Padrao stone monument at the bank of the Ciliwung River in 1522.

Although the treaty with the Portuguese had been established, it could not come to realisation. Sunda Kalapa harbour fell under the alliance of the Sultanates of Demak and Cirebon (former vassal state of Sunda kingdom) in 1524 after forces under Paletehan alias Fadillah Khan had conquered the city. In 1524–1525, troops under Sunan Gunung Jati also seized the port of Banten and established the Sultanate of Banten which was affiliated to the Demak Sultanate. The war between the Sunda kingdom and the Demak and Cirebon sultanates continued for five years until a peace treaty was made in 1531 between King Surawisesa and Sunan Gunung Jati. From 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, alias Prabu Surya Kencana, the Sunda kingdom declined, under pressure from Sultanate of Banten. After 1576, the kingdom could not maintain control over its capital at Pakuan Pajajaran (present-day Bogor), and gradually the Sultanate of Banten took over the former Sunda kingdom&#x27;s territory. The Mataram Sultanate from Central Java also seized the Priangan region, the southeastern part of the kingdom.
In the 16th century, Dutch and British trading companies established trading ships in western Java after the fall of the Sultanate of Banten. For the next three hundred years, western Java fell under the Dutch East Indies&#x27; administration. West Java was officially declared as a province of Indonesia in 1950, referring to a statement from Staatblad number 378. On 17 October 2000, as part of nationwide political decentralization, Banten was separated from West Java and made into a new province. There have been recent proposals to rename the province Pasundan (&quot;Land of the Sundanese&quot;) after the historical name for West Java.

==Government and administrative division==
Since the creation of West Java Province, the province of West Java was subdivided into four cities () and sixteen regencies (), excluding the four regencies which were separated off in 2000 to form the new Banten Province. Subsequently five new independent cities were created between 1996 and 2002 by separation from their surrounding regencies - Bekasi on 16 December 1996, Depok on 27 April 1999, Cimahi and Tasikmalaya on 21 June 2001, and Banjar on 11 December 2002. A 17th regency was formed on 2 January 2007 – West Bandung Regency – from the western half of Bandung Regency, and an 18th regency was formed in October 2012 – Pangandaran Regency – from the southern half of Ciamis Regency. On 25 October 2013, the People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) began reviewing draft laws on the establishment of 57 prospective new regencies (and eight new provinces), including a further three regencies in West Java – South Garut (Garut Selatan), North Sukabumi (Sukabumi Utara) and West Bogor (Bogor Barat) – but no action has followed in view of the moratorium adopted since 2013 by the Indonesian government on the creation of new provinces, regencies and cities, so none of these three prospective regencies are shown separately on the map below, nor in the following table. 

These 9 cities and 18 regencies are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with official estimates as at mid 2023. They are divided into 627 districts () as at 2023, which comprise 663 urban villages () and 5,294 rural villages (). The table also includes the average population density as at mid 2023 for each regency or city.).

Much of the population growth has been in the northwest corner of the province, in those areas bordering Jakarta and forming part of the Jakarta metropolitan area. These comprise Bekasi and Bogor Regencies, together with the separate cities of Bekasi, Bogor and Depok; in total they cover an area of 4,790.68 km2 and had a population estimated at 14,707,767 in mid 2023.

The province comprises eleven of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The province&#x27;s 91 elected members are comprised as follows:
* The West Java I Electoral District consists of the cities of Bandung and Cimahi, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java II Electoral District consists of the regencies of Bandung and West Bandung, and elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java III Electoral District consists of the regency of Cianjur, together with the city of Bogor (these two areas are non adjacent), and elects 9 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.
* The West Java IV Electoral District consists of the regency of Sukabumi and city of Sukabumi, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java V Electoral District consists solely of the regency of Bogor, and elects 9 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java VI Electoral District consists of the cities of Bekasi and Depok, and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java VII Electoral District consists of the regencies of Bekasi, Karawang and Purwakarta, and elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java VIII Electoral District consists of the regencies of Cirebon and Indramayu, together with the city of Cirebon, and elects 9 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java IX Electoral District consists of the regencies of Subang, Sumedang and Majalenka, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java X Electoral District consists of the regencies of Ciamis, Kuningan and Pangandaran, together with the city of Banjar, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 
* The West Java XI Electoral District consists of the regencies of Garut and Tasikmalaya, together with the city of Tasikmalaya, and elects 10 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

=== Human Development Index ===

Cities and Regencies in West Java range high to medium Human Development Index (HDI).
== Geography ==
West Java borders Jakarta and Banten province to the west and Central Java to the east. To the north is the Java Sea. To the south is the Indian Ocean. Unlike most other provinces in Indonesia which have their capitals in coastal areas, the provincial capital, Bandung, is located in the mountainous area in the centre of the province. Banten Province was formerly part of West Java but was created a separate province in 2000. West Java, in the densely populated western third of Java and covering a land area of 37,040.04 km2 (larger than Guinea-Bissau), is home to almost one out of every five Indonesians.
West Java and Banten provinces, as a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, have more mountains and volcanoes than any of the other provinces in Indonesia. The vast volcanic mountainous region of inland West Java is traditionally known as Parahyangan (also known as Priangan or Preanger) which means &quot;The abode of hyangs (gods)&quot;. It is considered as the heartland of the Sundanese people. The highest point of West Java is the stratovolcano Mount Cereme (3,078 metres) bordering Kuningan and Majalengka Regencies. West Java has rich and fertile volcanic soil. Agriculture, mostly traditional dry rice cultivation (known as &quot;ladang&quot; or &quot;huma&quot;), has become the primary way of life of traditional Sundanese people. Since the era of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), West Java has been known as a productive plantation area for coffee, tea, quinine, and many other cash crops. The mountainous region of West Java is also a major producer of vegetables and decorative flowering plants. The landscape of the province is one of volcanic mountains, rugged terrain, forest, mountains, rivers, fertile agricultural land, and natural sea harbours.

Flowing through the Bandung Basin to the northeast is the Tarum River (or &quot;Ci-tarum&quot;), the longest and most important river in the province. This 300-km long river is the site of three dams, namely Cirata Dam, Saguling Dam, and Jatiluhur Dam.

== Economy ==

Initially, the economy of the Sundanese people in West Java relied heavily on rice cultivation. Ancient kingdoms established in the province such as the Tarumanagara and Sunda Kingdom are known to have relied on rice taxes and agriculture revenues. The cycle of life of the ancient Sundanese people revolved around the rice crop cycle. Traditional rice harvest festivals such as the Seren Taun were important. The ancient goddess of rice, Nyai Pohaci Sanghyang Asri, is revered in Sundanese culture. Traditionally, Sundanese people often used dry rice cultivation (&quot;ladang&quot;). After the Mataram expanded to the Priangan area in the early 17th century following the Sultan Agung campaign against Dutch Batavia, &quot;sawah&quot; (wet rice cultivation) began to be adopted in the northern lowlands of West Java. Regencies such as Indramayu, Cirebon, Subang, Karawang and Bekasi are now well known as vital rice-producing areas. The mountainous region of West Java supplies vegetables, flower and much horticultural produce to Jakarta and Bandung, while animal farms in West Java produce dairy products and meats.

=== Colonial period ===

During the entire Dutch colonial era, West Java fell under Dutch administration centered in Batavia. The Dutch colonial government introduced cash crops such as tea, coffee, and quinine. Since the 18th century, West Java (known as &quot;De Preanger&quot;) was known as a productive plantation area and became integrated with global trade and economy. Services such as transportation and banking were provided to cater for wealthy Dutch plantation owners. West Java is known as one of the earliest developed regions in the Indonesian archipelago. In the early 20th century, the Dutch colonial government developed infrastructures for economic purposes, especially to support Dutch plantations in the region. Roads and railways were constructed to connect inland plantations area with urban centres such as Bandung and the port of Batavia.

=== Post independence ===
After Indonesian independence in 1945, West Java became a supporting region for Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Jakarta remained as the business and political centre of Indonesia. Several regencies and cities in West Java such as Bogor, Bekasi and Depok were developed as supporting areas for Jakarta and came to form the Greater Jakarta area or &quot;Jabodetabek&quot; (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi). The northern area of West Java has become a major industrial area, with areas such as Bekasi, Cikarang and Karawang sprawling with factories and industries. The area in and around Bandung has also developed as an industrial area.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is an important industry in West Java, and the Bandung and Puncak areas have long been known as popular weekend destinations for Jakartans. Today, Bandung has developed into a historical tourist destination, with the Merdeka Building and Braga Street shopping area popular not only among locals, but also with visitors from Malaysia and Singapore. The history-rich coastal city of Cirebon is also a cultural tourism destination since the city has several kratons and historical sites such as Gua Sunyaragi. Other tourist destinations include the Bogor Botanical Garden, Taman Safari, Tangkuban Perahu crater, Pelabuhanratu Bay, Ciater hot springs, Kawah Putih crater to the south of Bandung, Pangandaran beach, and various mountain resorts in Cianjur, Garut, Tasikmalaya, and Kuningan.

The average annual population growth rate recorded in the ten years to 2010 was 1.9%, but the growth has since slowed and was just 1.1% between 2020 and 2022.

=== Ethnic and linguistic composition ===

West Java is the native homeland of Sundanese people which forms the largest ethnic group in West Java. Since Jakarta and the surrounding area, including West Java, is the business and political centre of Indonesia, the province has attracted various people from other parts of Indonesia. The biggest minority is Javanese who migrated to the province centuries ago. Other Native Indonesian ethnic groups such as Minangkabau, Batak, Malay, Madurese, Balinese, Ambonese and many other Indonesians who migrated to and settled in West Java cities can also be easily found. The urban areas also have a significant population of Chinese Indonesians.

In addition to Indonesian, the official national language, the other widely spoken language in the province is Sundanese. In some areas near the southern borders with Central Java, Javanese is also spoken. The main language spoken in Cirebon and nearby areas (Majalengka, Indramayu, Sumber) is Cirebonese, a dialect of Javanese with Sundanese influence.

Indonesian is widely spoken as a second language.

===Religion===
, Islam is the largest religion in West Java, being practiced by 97.34% of the population. Minority religions are Christianity with 2,39% (Protestantism 1.78% and Roman Catholic 0.61%) , Buddhism 0.2%, Hinduism 0.035%, Confucianism 0.025% and Folk religion 0.01% of the population.

== Cultures ==

The Sundanese share the Java island with the Javanese and primarily live in West Java. Although the Sundanese live on the same island as the Javanese, their culture is distinct and likewise consider themselves to live in a separate cultural area called &quot;Pasundan&quot; or &quot;Tatar Sunda&quot;. Someone moving from West Java to Central or East Java is literally said to be moving from Sunda to Java worlds. Bandung is considered as the cultural heartland of Sundanese people, and many indigenous Sundanese artforms were developed in this city. The nearby province of Banten is similar in this regard and is also considered to be part of &quot;Pasundan&quot; as well.

=== Music ===

The musical arts of Sunda, which is an expression of the emotions of Sundanese culture, express politeness and grace of Sundanese. Degung orchestra consists of Sundanese gamelan. In addition to the Sundanese forms of Gamelan in Parahyangan, the region of Cirebon retains its own distinct musical traditions. Amongst Cirebons&#x27; varying Gamelan ensembles the two most frequently heard are Gamelan Pelog (a non-equidistant heptatonic tuning system) and Gamelan Prawa (a semi-equidistant pentatonic tuning system). Gamelan Pelog is traditionally reserved for Tayuban, Wayang Cepak, and listening and dance music of the Kratons in Cirebon, while Gamelan Prawa is traditionally reserved for Wayang Purwa.

Cirebon also retains specialised Gamelan ensembles including Sekaten, which is played in the Kratons to mark important times in the Islamic calendar, Denggung, also a Kraton ensemble, which is believed to have some &quot;supernatural powers&quot;, and Renteng, an ensemble found in both Cirebon and Parahyangan known for its loud and energetic playing style.

Tembang Sunda is a genre of Sundanese vocal music accompanied by a core ensemble of two Kacapi (zither) and a Suling (bamboo flute). The music and poetry of tembang Sunda are closely associated with the Parahyangan, the highland plateau that transverses the central and southern parts of Sunda. The natural environment of Priangan, an agricultural region surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, is reflected in some songs of the tembang Sunda.

Kacapi suling is tembang Sunda minus vocal. Tarawangsa is a genuine popular art is performed on ensemble consists of tarawangsa (a violin with an end pin) and the jentreng (a kind of seven-stringed zither). It is accompanied by a secret dance called Jentreng. The dance is a part of a ritual celebrating the goddess of paddy Dewi Sri. Its ceremonial significance is associated with a ritual of thanksgiving associated with the rice harvest. Tarawangsa can also be played for healing or even purely for entertainment.
The three main types of Sundanese bamboo ensembles are angklung, calung, karinding and arumba. The exact features of each ensemble vary according to context, related instruments, and relative popularity. Angklung is a generic term for sets of tuned, shaken bamboo rattles. Angklung consists of a frame upon which hang several different lengths of hollow bamboo. Angklungs are played like handbells, with each instrument played to a different note. Angklung rattles are played in interlocking patterns, usually with only one or two instruments played per person. The ensemble is used in Sundanese processions, sometimes with trance or acrobatics. 

Performed at life-cycle rituals and feasts (hajat), angklung is believed to maintain balance and harmony in the village. In its most modern incarnation, angklung is performed in schools as an aid to learning music. The Angklung received international attention when Daeng Soetigna, from Bandung, expanded the angklung notations not only to play traditional pélog or sléndro scales but also diatonic scale in 1938. Since then, angklung is often played together with other Western musical instruments in an orchestra. One of the first well-known performances of angklung in an orchestra was during the Bandung Conference in 1955. Like those in angklung, the instruments of the calung ensemble are of bamboo, but each consists of several differently tuned tubes fixed onto a piece of bamboo; the player holds the instrument in his left hand and strikes it with a beater held in his right. 

The highest-pitched calung has the highest number of tubes and the densest musical activity; the lowest-pitched, with two tubes, has the least. Calung is nearly always associated with earthy humour, and is played by men. Arumba refers to a set of diatonically tuned bamboo xylophones, often played by women. It is frequently joined by modern instruments, including a drum set, electric guitar, bass, and keyboards.

=== Theatre ===

&quot;Wayang golek&quot; is a traditional form of puppetry from Sunda. Unlike the better-known leather shadow puppets (&quot;wayang kulit&quot;) found in the rest of Java and Bali, &quot;wayang golek&quot; puppets are made from wood and are three-dimensional, rather than two. They use a banana palm in which the puppets stand, behind which one puppeteer (&quot;dalang&quot;) is accompanied by his &quot;gamelan&quot; orchestra with up to 20 musicians. The &quot;gamelan&quot; uses a five-note scale as opposed to the seven-note western scale. The musicians are guided by the drummer, who in turn is guided by signals from the puppet master dalang gives to change the mood or pace required. &quot;Wayang golek&quot; are used by the Sundanese to tell the epic play &quot;Mahabarata&quot;, and various other morality-type plays. Sandiwara Sunda is a type folk theater performed in Sundanese and presenting Sundanese themes, folklores and stories.

=== Dance ===
Sundanese dance shows the influence of the many groups that have traded and settled in the area over the centuries, and includes variations from graceful to dynamic syncopated drumming patterns, quick wrist flicks, sensual hip movements, and fast shoulder and torso isolations.
&quot;Jaipongan&quot; is probably the most popular traditional social dance of Sundanese people. It can be performed in solo, groups, or pair. 
The &quot;Tari Merak&quot; (Peafowl Dance) is a female dance inspired by the movements of a peafowl and its feathers blended with the classical movements of the Sundanese dance.

=== Folktales and legend stories ===

There are stories and folktales transcribed from Pantun Sunda stories.
Among the most well-known folktale and stories are:

*Mundinglaya Dikusumah, which tells of Mundinglaya visiting Jabaning Langit to find layang Salaka Domas. It is a symbolic story of Surawisesa visiting Malaka to establish a peace treaty with the Portuguese before 1522.
*Lutung Kasarung, tells the life of a beautiful princess, in the era of Pasir Batang kingdom, a vassal of Sunda kingdom. She faces the evil of her older sister willing to seize her right as a queen.
*Ciung Wanara, tells of the fight of two princes of Sunda kingdom and the history of Cipamali river (present-day Brebes river) as a boundary between Sundanese and Javanese territories.
*Sangkuriang, which tells the story of the creation of Mount Tangkuban Parahu and the ancient lake Bandung.
* Nyai Loro Kidul (also spelt &quot;Nyi Roro Kidul&quot;) is a legendary female spirit or deity, known as the Queen of the Southern Sea of Java (Indian Ocean or Samudra Kidul south of Java island) in Sundanese as well in Javanese and Balinese mythology.

=== Literature ===
Old Sundanese literature, among others, are:

*Bujangga Manik, which was written on 29 palm leaves and kept in the Bodleian Library in Oxford since 1627, mentioning more than 450 names of places, regions, rivers and mountains situated on Java island, Bali island and Sumatra island.
*Carita Parahyangan, telling Sundanese kings and kingdoms from the pre-Islamic period.
*Siksakandang Karesian, providing the reader with all kinds of religious and moralistic rules, prescriptions and lessons.

==Cuisine==
Sundanese cuisine is one of the most famous traditional food in Indonesia, and it is also easily found in most Indonesian cities. The Sundanese food is characterized by its freshness; the famous &quot;lalab&quot; (raw vegetables salad) eaten with &quot;sambal&quot; (chili paste), and also &quot;karedok&quot; (peanuts paste) demonstrate the Sundanese fondness for fresh raw vegetables. Similar to other ethnic groups in Indonesia, Sundanese people eat rice for almost every meal. The Sundanese like to say, &quot;If you have not eaten rice, then you have not eaten at all.&quot; Rice is prepared in hundreds of different ways. However, it is simple steamed rice that serves as the centrepiece of all meals.

Next to steamed rice, the side dishes of vegetables, fish, or meat are added to provide a variety of tastes as well as for protein, mineral and nutrient intake. These side dishes are grilled, fried, steamed or boiled and spiced with any combination of garlic, galangal (a plant of the ginger family), turmeric, coriander, ginger, and lemongrass. The herb-rich food wrapped and cooked inside banana leaf called &quot;pepes&quot; (Sundanese: &quot;pais&quot;) is popular among Sundanese people. &quot;Pepes&quot; are available in many varieties according to their ingredients; carp fish, anchovies, minced meat with eggs, mushroom, tofu or oncom. &quot;Oncom&quot; is a fermented peanut-based ingredient that is prevalent within Sundanese cuisine, just like its counterpart, Tempe, which is popular among Javanese people. Usually, the food itself is not too spicy, but it is served with a boiling sauce made by grinding chilli peppers and garlic together. On the coast, saltwater fish are common; in the mountains, fish tend to be either pond-raised carp or goldfish. A well-known Sundanese dish is &quot;lalapan&quot;, which consists only of raw vegetables, such as papaya leaves, cucumber, eggplant, and bitter melon.

<text>The University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is a public research university located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The university was founded in its current form in 1988, though its origins as a technical institution can be traced back to the 1870s. UTS is a founding member of the Australian Technology Network (ATN), and is a member of Universities Australia (UA) and the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN).

The university is organised into 9 faculties and schools, which together administers 130 undergraduate courses and 210 postgraduate courses. In 2023, the university enrolled 47,913 students, including 33,579 undergraduate students. The university is home to over 45 research centres and institutes, who regularly collaborates along with industry and government partners.

UTS recognises more than 180 different clubs and societies. Its varsity sports teams, which is overseen by UTS Sport, competes in the UniSport Nationals as well as in standalone national championships throughout the year. As of 2023, the university has over 290,000 alumni across 140 countries.

==History==
The Sydney Mechanics&#x27; School of Arts (the oldest continuously running Mechanics&#x27; Institute in Australia) was established in 1833. In the 1870s, the school expanded into technical education and formed the Working Men&#x27;s College, which was later taken over by the NSW government to form the Sydney Technical College.

In 1940 the NSW Parliament passed an Act to establish an Institute of Technology, which in 1964 led to the establishment of the New South Wales Institute of Technology (NSWIT). In 1968, the NSW Institute of Technology amalgamated with the NSW Institute of Business Studies. In 1976 NSWIT established the first law school in NSW outside the university sector. The Haymarket campus officially opened in 1985.

On 8 October 1987 university status was granted to NSWIT, which was followed by the passing of the &quot;University of Technology, Sydney, Act 1987&quot;. It was reconstituted as the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) on 26 January 1988, along with the incorporation of the School of Design of the former Sydney College of the Arts. In 1989, the &quot;University of Technology, Sydney, Act 1989 (NSW)&quot; formed UTS by absorbing the Kuring-gai College of Advanced Education (KCAE) and the Institute of Technical and Adult Teacher Education (ITATE) of the Sydney College of Advanced Education. By 1991, an academic structure of nine faculties and 25 schools was established.

The School of Design was initially housed at a campus in Balmain, which closed at the end of 1994, with the school moved to a new building at the city campus. The environmental, biological and biomedical science schools were located on a campus at St Leonards, which was closed in 2006, which also relocated to the city campus following a redevelopment.

The Kuring-Gai campus closed at the end of 2015, with classes and facilities moved into the main Haymarket campus. This marked the consolidation of UTS into a single unified campus in the Sydney CBD.

==Campuses and buildings==

The UTS city campus is located at the southern border of Sydney&#x27;s central business district, close to Central station and Railway Square, within Sydney&#x27;s emerging Tech Central. The UTS Tower is the nucleus of the city campus, fronting on to Broadway.

The campus consists of five distinct precincts. Broadway, Haymarket and Blackfriars are located at the city campus, while precincts at Moore Park and Botany integrate specialist facilities with surrounding industry organisations. Broadway (located in Ultimo) is home to the faculties of Science, Health, Law, Arts and Social Sciences, Engineering and IT, and Design, Architecture and Building, as well as the UTS Library. Haymarket is the location of the Business School, UTS Startups, the UTS Animal Logic Academy and two lecture theatres in the Powerhouse Museum. The Blackfriars precinct in Chippendale contains the Blackfriars Children&#x27;s Centre and research and innovation teams while the Moore Park precinct features sports facilities within the Rugby Australia Building and the Botany precinct consists of the specialist research facility UTS Tech Lab.

The campus has been substantially transformed since 2008 by the university&#x27;s City Campus Master Plan, a $1 billion-plus investment in new buildings and facilities, major upgrades and refurbishments.

===Buildings and architecture===

The UTS Tower on Broadway (Building 1) is an example of brutalist architecture with square and block concrete designs. Completed and officially opened in 1979 by Premier Neville Wran, the Tower initially housed the NSW Institute of Technology, which transformed to become UTS in the late 1980s. In October 2006, the UTS Tower was voted the ugliest building in Sydney in a poll hosted by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, receiving 23% of the total vote. The Tower is the largest campus building in terms of both height and floor space.

Other notable buildings in the Broadway precinct include:

* Building 2, UTS Central, is intended as a central hub for the campus. Opened in August 2019, the 17-storey building is encased in glass and includes the UTS Library, the Faculty of Law, the Hive Super Lab, three large collaborative classrooms, student spaces and a food court. The new food court includes outlets such as Mad Mex, Chatime, PapaRich and Uni Bros, and all single-use plastic packaging has been replaced with fully compostable, reusable or recyclable alternatives. It was designed by Australian architectural firm Francis-Jones Morehan Thorp.
* Building 3, the Bon Marche Building, which dates to the 1890s and was named after the Parisian department store Le Bon Marché. Originally a department store operated by Marcus Clark &amp; Co, the building was incorporated into the university campus in 2000 and now accommodates specialist facilities for the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.
* Building 7, or the Vicki Sara Building, home to Faculty of Science administration and specialist facilities, and the original home of the Graduate School of Health (which moved to Building 20 at 100 Broadway in 2020). Designed by architects Durbach Block Jaggers, in association with BVN Architecture, it has been awarded a 6 Star Green Star Design and As-Built rating, certified by the Green Building Council of Australia, and includes many sustainable features including a rooftop garden with stormwater collection and recycled building materials.
* Building 10 on Jones St colloquially known as &#x27;the Fairfax Building&#x27; as it originally accommodated the printing facilities for the Fairfax-owned &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. It was later home to the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), before being incorporated within the UTS campus in the early 2000s. It accommodates the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and the Faculty of Health. The refurbished building received the 2003 Sir John Sulman Award for Public Architecture.
* Building 11, which opened in 2014 and accommodates the Faculty of Engineering and IT, along with many of its specialist facilities. Designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall, the building is encased in aluminium screens perforated with binary code that spells out the name of the faculty. &#x27;Gills&#x27; creased into the aluminium plates light up green at night and symbolically represent the building as a living, breathing structure.
* Alumni Green, the central green space on campus, encircled by prominent campus buildings including the Tower. Designed by landscape architects ASPECT Studios, Alumni Green consists of three distinct zones: a garden area with outdoor seating; a paved open space modelled on celebrated town squares; and a 1200m2 raised grass platform, which creates a green roof for a 13,000m2 underground Library Retrieval System.

The Haymarket precinct includes buildings such as:

* Building 5, former market buildings with a heritage façade and modern interior, designed by architect Phillip Cox. The building accommodates administrative, teaching and learning space for the UTS College.
* Building 8, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building, is the first Australian building designed by celebrated architect Frank Gehry and is considered a contemporary architectural icon. The building accommodates teaching, learning, research and office space for the UTS Business School. Design features include a prominent polished stainless steel staircase that acts as a sculptural focal point in the main lobby, undulating brickwork with approximately 320,000 individual bricks referencing Sydney sandstone laid by hand and two oval classrooms constructed of large laminated timber beams.

Additionally in the Moore Park precinct, the Rugby Australia Building contains specialist facilities for UTS students, staff and researchers working across sport and exercise science, physiotherapy and sport media. Designed by architects Populous, the building is also the headquarters of Rugby Australia and home to Australia&#x27;s national rugby teams. The external fixed aluminium shading controls solar penetration, while internal spaces include the purpose-built laboratories of the Human Performance Research Centre.

A number of UTS campus buildings have received a certified Green Star rating from the Green Building Council of Australia. The Vicki Sara Building has been awarded a 6 Star Green Star Design and As-Built Rating, while the Faculty of Engineering and IT and Dr Chau Chak Wing Buildings has been awarded 5 stars.

=== Neighbouring organisations ===
The core of the UTS city campus is located close to many Sydney landmarks and notable organisations including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Powerhouse Museum, TAFE Ultimo, the International Convention Centre Sydney, Darling Harbour and Chinatown.

<text>François l&#x27;Hermite (c. 16017 September 1655) was a French dramatist who wrote under the name Tristan l&#x27;Hermite. He was born at the Château de Soliers in the Haute Marche.

==Life==
His adventures began early, for he killed his enemy in a duel at the age of thirteen, and was obliged to flee to England. The story of his childhood and youth he embroiders in a burlesque novel, the . He was, in succession, poet to Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, to the duchesse de Chaulnes and the duke of Guise.

His first tragedy, &quot;Marianne&quot; (1636), was also his best. It was followed by &quot;Penthée&quot; (1637), &quot;La Mort de Seneque&quot; (1644), &quot;La Mort de Crispe&quot; (1645) and the &quot;Parasite&quot; (1654). He was also the author of some admirable lyrics. Three of his best plays are printed in the &quot;Théâtre français&quot; of 1737.

He took his pseudonym from Tristan l&#x27;Hermite, a shadowy figure of the late Middle Ages who was provost of the marshals of the King&#x27;s household under Louis XI of France.

He died of tuberculosis.

<doc id="314362" wikidata="Q196984" url="?curid=314362" title="Zeugma and syllepsis">
<text>In rhetoric, zeugma (; from the Ancient Greek , , &quot;a yoking together&quot;) and syllepsis (; from the Ancient Greek , , &quot;a taking together&quot;) are figures of speech in which a single phrase or word joins different parts of a sentence.

== Definition ==
In current usage, there are multiple and sometimes conflicting definitions for zeugma and syllepsis. This article categorizes these two figures of speech into four types, based on four definitions:

=== Type 1 ===
Grammatical syllepsis (sometimes also called &quot;zeugma&quot;): where a single word is used in relation to two parts of a sentence although grammatically or logically applying to only one.

By definition, grammatical syllepsis will often be grammatically &quot;incorrect&quot; according to traditional grammatical rules. However, such solecisms are sometimes not errors but intentional constructions in which the rules of grammar are bent by necessity or for stylistic effect.

* &quot;He works his work, I mine&quot; 

This quote from Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Ulysses&quot; is ungrammatical from a grammarian&#x27;s viewpoint, because &quot;works&quot; does not grammatically agree with &quot;I&quot;: the sentence &quot;I works mine&quot; would be ungrammatical. On the other hand, Tennyson&#x27;s two sentences could be taken to deploy a different figure of speech, namely &quot;ellipsis&quot;. The sentence would be taken to mean,

* &quot;He works his work, [and] I [work] mine.&quot;

Read in this way, the conjunction is not ungrammatical.

=== Type 2 ===
Zeugma (often also called &quot;syllepsis&quot;, or &quot;semantic syllepsis&quot;): a single word is used in two parts of a sentence but must be understood differently in relation to each. Example: &quot;He took his hat and his leave.&quot; The type of figure is grammatically correct but creates its effect by seeming, at first hearing, to be incorrect by its exploiting multiple shades of meaning in a single word or phrase.

*&quot;Here Thou, great Anna! whom three Realms obey,Dost sometimes Counsel take and sometimes Tea.&quot; (Alexander Pope, &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, Canto III)
* &quot;Miss Bolo [...] went straight home, in a flood of tears and a sedan-chair.&quot; (Charles Dickens, &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, )
* “They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; / They pursued it with forks and hope.”(Lewis Carroll, “The Hunting of the Snark”)
* &quot;And he said as he hastened to put out the cat, the wine, his cigar, and the lamps... She lowered her standards by raising her glass, her courage, her eyes and his hopes... When he asked &#x27;What in heaven?&#x27; she made no reply, up her mind, and a dash for the door.&quot; (Flanders and Swann, &quot;Have Some Madeira M&#x27;Dear&quot;)
* &quot;They covered themselves with dust and glory.&quot; (Mark Twain, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;).
* &quot;He watches afternoon repeats and the food he eats.&quot; (Blur, &quot;Country House&quot;)
* &quot;You held your breath and the door for me.&quot; (Alanis Morissette, &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;)
* &quot;I took the podium and my second trophy of the evening.&quot; (Samuel R. Delany, &quot;Racism and Science Fiction&quot;) 
*&quot;My blood sugar fell dramatically and so did I.&quot; (Elaine Stritch, &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;)
* &quot;&quot; (Voltaire)
*:&quot;When the scatterbrained French / Off to Italy went, / They gained in their foolishness / Genoa, Naples and the pox.&quot;

When the meaning of a verb varies for the nouns following it, there is a standard order for the nouns: the noun first takes the most prototypical or literal meaning of the verb and is followed by the noun or nouns taking the less prototypical or more figurative verb meanings.

* &quot;The boy swallowed milk and kisses,&quot; as contrasted with &quot;The boy swallowed kisses and milk&quot;.

The opposite process, in which the first noun expresses a figurative meaning and the second a more literal meaning, tends to create a comic effect: &quot;and she feeds me love and tenderness and macaroons.&quot; (The Stampeders, &quot;Sweet City Woman&quot;)

=== Type 3 ===
The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms&quot; offers a much broader definition for &quot;zeugma&quot; by defining it as any case of parallelism and ellipsis working together so that a single word governs two or more parts of a sentence.

* (Cicero, , VI.15)
*:&quot;Lust conquered shame; audacity, fear; madness, reason.&quot;

The more usual way of phrasing this would be &quot;Lust conquered shame, audacity conquered fear, and madness conquered reason.&quot; The sentence consists of three parallel clauses, called parallel because each has the same word order: verb, object, subject in the original Latin; subject, verb, object in the English translation. The verb &quot;conquered&quot; is a common element in each clause. The zeugma is created in both the original and the translation by removing the second and third instances of &quot;conquered&quot;. Removing words that still can be understood by the context of the remaining words is ellipsis.

* Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle; natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend. (Francis Bacon)

The more usual way of phrasing this would be &quot;Histories make men wise, poets make them witty, mathematics make them subtle, natural philosophy makes them deep, moral [philosophy] makes them grave, and logic and rhetoric make them able to contend.&quot; (Because ellipsis involves the omission of words, ambiguities can arise. The sentence could also be read as, &quot;Histories make men wise, make poets witty, make mathematics subtle, make natural philosophy deep, makes moral [philosophy] grave, and make logic and rhetoric able to contend.&quot;)

Zeugmas are defined in this sense in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 18th-century &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;.

=== Type 4 ===
A special case of semantic syllepsis occurs when a word or phrase is used both in its figurative and literal sense at the same time. Then, it is not necessary for the governing phrase to relate to two parts of the sentence. One example is in an advertisement for a transport company: &quot;We go a long way for you.&quot; This type of syllepsis operates in a similar manner to a homonymic pun.

== Other types and related figures ==
There are several other definitions of zeugma that encompass other ways in which one word in a sentence can relate to two or more others. Even a simple construction like &quot;this is easy and comprehensible&quot; has been called a &quot;zeugma without complication&quot; because &quot;is&quot; governs both &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;comprehensible&quot;.

Specialized figures have been defined to distinguish zeugmas with particular characteristics such as the following figures, which relate to the specific type and location of the governing word:

=== Diazeugma ===
A diazeugma is a zeugma whose only subject governs multiple verbs. A diazeugma whose only subject begins the sentence and controls a series of verbs is a &quot;disjunction&quot; () in the .

* (Anon. . IV. xxvii.)
*:The Roman people destroyed Numantia, razed Carthage, demolished Corinth, and overthrew Fregellae.
* &quot;We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&quot; (Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy)

=== Hypozeugma ===
Hypozeugma or &quot;adjunctions&quot; () is used in a construction containing several phrases and occurs when the word or words on which all of the phrases depend are placed at the end.
* Assure yourself that Damon to his Pythias, Pylades to his Orestes, Titus to his Gysippus, Theseus to his Pyrothus, Scipio to his Laelius, was never found more faithful than Euphues will be to his Philautus. (John Lyly, &quot;Euphues&quot;)

=== Prozeugma ===
A prozeugma, &quot;synezeugmenon&quot;, or is a zeugma whose governing word occurs in the first clause of the sentence.

* (Cicero, , VI.15)
*:&quot;Lust conquered shame; audacity, fear; madness, reason.&quot;
* Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle; natural philosophy, deep; moral, grave; logic and rhetoric, able to contend. (Francis Bacon)

=== Mesozeugma ===
A mesozeugma is a zeugma whose governing word occurs in the middle of the sentence and governs clauses on either side. A mesozeugma whose common term is a verb is called &quot;conjunction&quot; () in the Roman .

*&quot;What a shame is this, that neither hope of reward, nor feare of reproch could any thing move him, neither the persuasion of his friends, nor the love of his country. &quot; (Henry Peacham)

<text>H&quot;∞(i.e. &quot;H&quot;-infinity&quot;) methods are used in control theory to synthesize controllers to achieve stabilization with guaranteed performance. To use &quot;H&quot;∞ methods, a control designer expresses the control problem as a mathematical optimization problem and then finds the controller that solves this optimization. &quot;H&quot;∞ techniques have the advantage over classical control techniques in that &quot;H&quot;∞ techniques are readily applicable to problems involving multivariate systems with cross-coupling between channels; disadvantages of &quot;H&quot;∞ techniques include the level of mathematical understanding needed to apply them successfully and the need for a reasonably good model of the system to be controlled. It is important to keep in mind that the resulting controller is only optimal with respect to the prescribed cost function and does not necessarily represent the best controller in terms of the usual performance measures used to evaluate controllers such as settling time, energy expended, etc. Also, non-linear constraints such as saturation are generally not well-handled. These methods were introduced into control theory in the late 1970s-early 1980s
by George Zames (sensitivity minimization), J. William Helton (broadband matching),
and Allen Tannenbaum (gain margin optimization).

The phrase &quot;H&quot;∞ &quot;control&quot; comes from the name of the mathematical space over which the optimization takes place: &quot;H&quot;∞ is the &quot;Hardy space&quot; of matrix-valued functions that are analytic and bounded in the open right-half of the complex plane defined by Re(&quot;s&quot;) &gt; 0; the &quot;H&quot;∞ norm is the supremum singular value of the matrix over that space. In the case of a scalar-valued function, the elements of the Hardy space that extend continuously to the boundary and are continuous at infinity is the disk algebra. For a matrix-valued function, the norm can be interpreted as a maximum gain in any direction and at any frequency; for SISO systems, this is effectively the maximum magnitude of the frequency response. 

&quot;H&quot;∞ techniques can be used to minimize the closed loop impact of a perturbation: depending on the problem formulation, the impact will either be measured in terms of stabilization or performance. Simultaneously optimizing robust performance and robust stabilization is difficult. One method that comes close to achieving this is &quot;H&quot;∞ loop-shaping, which allows the control designer to apply classical loop-shaping concepts to the multivariable frequency response to get good robust performance, and then optimizes the response near the system bandwidth to achieve good robust stabilization.

Commercial software is available to support &quot;H&quot;∞ controller synthesis.

== Problem formulation ==

First, the process has to be represented according to the following standard configuration:

The plant &quot;P&quot; has two inputs, the exogenous input &quot;w&quot;, that includes reference signal and disturbances, and the manipulated variables &quot;u&quot;. There are two outputs, the error signals &quot;z&quot; that we want to minimize, and the measured variables &quot;v&quot;, that we use to control the system. &quot;v&quot; is used in &quot;K&quot; to calculate the manipulated variables &quot;u&quot;. Notice that all these are generally vectors, whereas P and K are matrices.

In formulae, the system is:

:formula_1

:formula_2

It is therefore possible to express the dependency of &quot;z&quot; on &quot;w&quot; as:

:formula_3

Called the &quot;lower linear fractional transformation&quot;, formula_4 is defined (the subscript comes from &quot;lower&quot;):

:formula_5

Therefore, the objective of formula_6 control design is to find a controller formula_7 such that formula_8 is minimised according to the formula_6 norm. The same definition applies to formula_10 control design. The infinity norm of the transfer function matrix formula_8 is defined as:

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the maximum singular value of the matrix formula_14.

The achievable &quot;H&quot;∞ norm of the closed loop system is mainly given through the matrix &quot;D&quot;11 (when the system &quot;P&quot; is given in the form (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;1, &quot;B&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2, &quot;D&quot;11, &quot;D&quot;12, &quot;D&quot;22, &quot;D&quot;21)). There are several ways to come to an &quot;H&quot;∞ controller:
* A Youla-Kucera parametrization of the closed loop often leads to very high-order controller.
* Riccati-based approaches solve two Riccati equations to find the controller, but require several simplifying assumptions.
* An optimization-based reformulation of the Riccati equation uses linear matrix inequalities and requires fewer assumptions.

<text>Minder is a British comedy-drama series about the London criminal underworld. Initially produced by Verity Lambert, it was made by Euston Films, a subsidiary of Thames Television, and shown on ITV for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994.

The series was revived by Channel 5 in 2009 but was discontinued after only six episodes. It was nominated three times for Best Drama Series or Serial at the British Academy Television Awards.

==Plot==
The first seven series starred Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, an honest and likeable former boxer turned bodyguard (&quot;minder&quot; in Cockney parlance), and George Cole as Arthur Daley, an ageing chancer and petty schemer, importer/exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor of anything else from which there was money to be made, legally or not.

The series is principally set in working class west London (specifically Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Ladbroke Grove, Fulham and Acton), and was largely responsible for introducing the word , meaning personal bodyguard, into the UK popular lexicon. The characters often drank at the local members-only Winchester Club, where owner and barman Dave Harris (Glynn Edwards) acted, often unwittingly, as a messenger for Arthur, and turned a blind eye to his shady deals.

===Series 1–7===
Although initially developed to focus on Terry&#x27;s character, equal prominence was allotted to Arthur and his dodgy dealings as the series progressed. Barman Dave Harris at first made only occasional appearances, but the character also became popular and by the second series Dave was featured more prominently as well. The opening sequence of Series 7 was changed slightly to include shots of Terry, Arthur and Dave at the Winchester, and Edwards was given his own billing rather than remaining among the guest cast.

===Series 8–10===
In 1989, after filming the seventh series, Waterman left the cast, feeling that the character had run its course and that it was becoming harder for the writers to come up with plots as sharp as the earlier series. Minder returned in 1991 with another character replacing Terry. Waterman&#x27;s final episode, Series 7&#x27;s coincidentally titled &quot;The Wrong Goodbye&quot;, was filmed before Waterman announced his departure from the series, so there was no mention in the episode of Terry&#x27;s forthcoming departure either. In the opening episode of series 8, &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Entrepreneur&quot;, Arthur finds Terry has married and emigrated to Australia to finally escape his influence. At the same time, he is stuck with looking after his nephew Ray Daley (Gary Webster), at the request of Arthur&#x27;s brother, to give him employment and keep him out of trouble.

With Terry gone, local undesirables start to muscle in on Arthur, but it soon emerges that Ray is able to handle himself in a tight situation, so Arthur appoints him his new &quot;minder&quot;. Ray is well spoken, well educated (O Level French and woodwork) and less likely to be called upon as a pugilist, as fights were far less frequent and graphic than in the show&#x27;s early episodes. He dresses snappily in designer suits, prefers mineral water or a soft drink to a pint of ale, but lacks his own car, usually relying upon the beaten up old blue Ford Transit van from Arthur&#x27;s lockup.

The original theme tune was replaced by a rock-style instrumental version, credited to &quot;Kenny&quot; (Gerard Kenny). By this stage, the grittier elements of the early series had been toned down in favour of the comedic aspects of Arthur&#x27;s dodgy dealings. Waterman praised Gary Webster for fitting into the series, but remained vocal in his comments that the series was no longer about a &quot;minder&quot;, and that the revamped version should go under a different title, reflecting its reorientation to Arthur.

Other new characters were Sidney Livingstone (previously appearing as casino bouncer in the episode, &quot;You Lose Some, You Win Some&quot;) as Bert Daley, Arthur&#x27;s gullible brother and Ray&#x27;s father, who views Arthur as a successful businessman rather than a con man, and entrusts Ray to his care; Bert&#x27;s wife and Ray&#x27;s mum, Doreen (Lill Roughley); and Ray&#x27;s recurring girlfriend Gloria (Emma Cunningham), who is frustrated with Ray being torn between her and Arthur. The new police nemeses were Detective Sergeant Michael Morley (Nick Day), and D.C. Park (Stephen Tompkinson) in series 8, who in turn, was replaced by D.C. Field (Jonty Stephens) in series 9.

At the conclusion of the final episode of Series 10, &quot;The Long Good Thursday&quot;, Arthur along with Ray, Dave and crazy prisoner, Frankie (Matthew Scurfield), are finally apprehended by the police who drive them away in a convoy. In a final monologue over closing credits, a bemused Arthur protests that he is a hardworking, upstanding citizen. The following week, a slightly edited version of the first episode, &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Laundrette&quot; was broadcast. In the introduction, in response to being asked to name his favourite episode, Cole states that &quot;all were of such quality that he could not&quot;. He closed with &quot;Goodbye... for now&quot;.

===Series 11===

In 2009, &quot;Minder&quot; resumed on Channel 5 after a 15-year break. The first episode of the six-part series was broadcast on 4 February. The makers emphasised that it was a revival rather than a remake.

The show focused on Arthur&#x27;s nephew Archie, played by Shane Richie, and a new minder, Jamie Cartwright, played by Lex Shrapnel. Channel 5 stated that there were no plans for Cole, Waterman or Webster to reprise their roles. The series was produced by Talkback Thames.

In the weeks leading up to the new series, Channel 5 launched a national advertising campaign to promote the show&#x27;s return. These featured a series of adverts on television and billboards. Other promotions included advertisements on taxi receipts, a social networking campaign and branded beer mats, all designed to attract the young male audience Channel 5 was targeting. Although a Christmas episode was initially planned and announced ahead of the intended second series, due to poor ratings Channel 5 did not commission either.

==Cast and characters==

===Terry McCann===
Terry (Dennis Waterman) is a former professional boxer who has served time in Wormwood Scrubs (&quot;two years for GBH and three for attempted robbery&quot; according to a police sergeant in the first episode, &quot;Gunfight at the OK Laundrette&quot;, although other episodes slightly contradict this and the overall details are often quite vague), having served a substantial term because he would not become an informant against his co-accused. With few options, Terry is employed as Arthur&#x27;s &quot;minder&quot; on vague and ungenerous terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has manipulated him into this job, and indeed is seen to continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character&#x27;s run in the series, despite Terry often attempting to find other means of employment and break free from Arthur&#x27;s control (the later feature-length special &quot;An Officer and a Car Salesman&quot;, which leads into Series 7, Terry&#x27;s last stint in the series, begins with Terry once again inside, this time after being caught with some of Arthur&#x27;s dodgy merchandise). In Terry and Arthur&#x27;s final episode &quot;The Wrong Goodbye&quot;, it is suggested that one of Terry&#x27;s prison terms was taken in place of Arthur and explains why Arthur and Terry have a deep bond, though casts Arthur&#x27;s treatment of Terry in far less flattering light.

In the title sequence, Arthur is shown meeting Terry at the prison gates following his release. He drives a white Ford Capri (though is sometimes seen driving a copper-coloured Capri in some episodes, and a silver Capri in several others). Terry enjoys a drink but usually responsibly, does not smoke and has an eye for the ladies. Despite his incarceration, he is honest, trustworthy and loyal, particularly to Arthur, although the scrapes that Arthur lands him in make him wonder why. He is intelligent and streetwise enough to disperse situations that his role as minder often lands himself, and Arthur or those around him, in, although at the same time is seen not to be strong willed enough to break free of Arthur&#x27;s often devious ways of keeping their working relationship in place.

Indeed, it is Terry&#x27;s romantic interests who are far less impressed with Arthur&#x27;s hold on Terry and frequently suggest that he should break free from Arthur and start making his own path in life (often as a precursor to a deeper relationship). Arthur sees these women as a threat to his workforce and is not averse to breaking up any relationship which may interfere in Terry&#x27;s availability. While Terry resents this, he is also commitment shy and resists attempts to settle down often, which Arthur exploits through a thinly veiled desire for him to be independent of women.

===Arthur Daley===

Arthur Edward Daley (George Cole) is a mid-level professional criminal of mature years, a minor con man eternally involved in dodgy dealings and usually seen puffing Castella Panatella cigars. In the series 3 episode &quot;In&quot;, a German police officer reading Arthur&#x27;s file reveals that Arthur served 18 months in prison during the 1950s but does not reveal the reason. In early episodes he is depicted as more cunning and streetwise, as well as showing an interest in young women. Later his character is softened, becoming more of a cowardly con man than an outright villain and almost prudish about young women. Arthur&#x27;s exact age is only ever stated once, in S1 E1, when he tells Terry&#x27;s date that he is 52 and thus born in 1927. Later, in S2 E6, he is said to have been called up for National Service in 1949, implying a birth year of 1931 (George Cole was born in 1925).

Arthur typically drives an upmarket car; the Jaguar XJ6 being the vehicle the character is most associated with. In the early episodes he drives a 4.2 Series II XJ6. In the latter part of Series 3, Arthur has changed over to a silver Mercedes 280E and in Series 4 he drives a Portland beige Daimler Sovereign 4.2 Series III. Series 7 again sees Arthur driving a silver Jaguar XJ6. As a used car salesman, Arthur occasionally makes use of other cars. In the Series 3 episode &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, he uses a Ford Granada Mk.II. However, due to an accident, this car has to be repaired and Arthur is forced to borrow a friend&#x27;s customised Chevrolet Corvette C3 Stingray that he is trying to sell. Also in Series 3, Arthur uses a brown Jaguar XJR in the episodes &quot;Dead Men Do Tell Tales&quot; and &quot;Looking for Micky&quot;. In the Series 7 episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Sorry Lorry, Morrie&quot;, Arthur is down on his luck and has to resort to driving a clapped-out mustard yellow Ford Granada Mk.II. In the episode &quot;A Nice Little Wine&quot; Daley drives, in order to test, a pale blue Rover SD1. In the special episode &quot;An Officer and a Car Salesman&quot;, Arthur has moved up in the world and drives a yellow Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. In the later Ray Webster era, he then has a silver Jaguar XJ40.

He survives by his wiles and self-belief, and exploits everyone around him, especially Terry. He is always trying to make extra money, which he often describes as a &quot;nice little earner&quot;, and his schemes usually backfire and leave him either in debt to local underworld figures, or with his activities coming under the scrutiny of the police, or occasionally a combination of the two, with Terry ultimately being left to sort out the mess and get him out of trouble. Arthur thinks of himself as an &quot;entrepreneur&quot;, but his tailored three-piece suits, Jaguar and social affectations do not disguise his working class origins. Arthur tests Terry&#x27;s patience with dishonest and doomed schemes to make money, then uses his cunning to persuade Terry to stay with him. In the same way, Arthur manipulates friends such as Dave, the barman (and part owner with Arthur) of the private, downmarket Winchester Club. Most episodes depict Arthur losing or only just breaking even as the result of some scheme going wrong. However, Arthur owns various businesses outright or is a part-owner as well as partner with Dave in the Winchester, and he also seems to own various rental properties.

Arthur refers to his wife, who never appeared, as &quot;&#x27;Er indoors&quot;, the implication being that she is a fierce and formidable woman. Arthur is not above bending the law and sometimes attracts the attention of the police. Despite Terry&#x27;s own prison sentence, with an additional oblique reference to &quot;minor misdemeanours in the dim and distant past&quot;, he serves as the show&#x27;s moral conscience, keeping Arthur from straying too far outside the law and persuading him to do the right thing whether Arthur likes it or not. The name Arthur Daley has become synonymous with a dishonest salesman or small-time crook.

With Arthur&#x27;s dodgy schemes, the duo encounter undesirable underworld figures, many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit their way out of trouble. But for all Arthur&#x27;s obsession with get-rich-quick schemes, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair often end up putting some other wrong right or helping others in need or who have been done wrong by, even if it proves to be the hindrance to Arthur&#x27;s latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur&#x27;s schemes fail in the end, owing to his incompetence or greed, but he does occasionally have minor victories and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.

Arthur&#x27;s favourite drink was a large vodka and tonic, which he referred to as a &quot;large V.A.T&quot;, a wordplay on Value Added Tax (the UK tax on sales).

===Ray Daley===
After Terry leaves, Arthur is persuaded by his brother Bert to give his son Ray (Gary Webster) a job. Ray is only a few years out of school, reasonably well educated, but directionless and on the fringes of dodgy company (mostly those he went to school with). He is appointed Arthur&#x27;s &quot;minder&quot; and proves well able to handle the job, although he is also keen to &quot;get into tie-wearing activities&quot;. To this end, he finds himself carrying out a wide range of jobs, from car mechanic (&#x27;The Immaculate Contraption&#x27;) to barge navigation (&#x27;The Cruel Canal&#x27;) and satellite dish installation (&#x27;The Roof of all Evil&#x27;). Unlike Terry, Ray has no police record but that does not stop him being apprehended by police, and Arthur has to talk them into letting him go (&#x27;Cars and Pints and Pains&#x27;). Ray is a snappy dresser, typically seen in designer suits, and not a heavy drinker, usually seen sipping mineral water or a &quot;Saint Clements&quot; (orange and lemon). Ray does not initially have a drivers licence but can handle most vehicles, including the beaten up old blue Ford Transit van from Arthur&#x27;s lock-up. Like Terry, he has an eye for the ladies but the affairs are usually short. He eventually moves in with Gloria, a professional photographer, but she is frustrated to be playing second fiddle to Ray&#x27;s sense of duty to Arthur&#x27;s welfare.

===Dave Harris===
Dave (Glynn Edwards) is a childhood friend, part owner (with Arthur) and bar manager of the local, members-only Winchester Club. Arthur and Terry regularly drink there and Dave acts, often unwillingly, as a message service for Arthur, and turns a blind eye to the shady deals being arranged by the patrons. As a counsel and resource of last resort, he on occasion helps Arthur and Terry get out of tight spots through offering advice, money, space at the Winchester to store items or people and reluctantly, personal information through a brother-in-law working in the police.

With a trading licence to maintain, he is a wise character keeping the delicate balance of a legitimate private members&#x27; drinking establishment and a safe space for the local villains to congregate. Frequently given first refusal on Arthur&#x27;s dodgy merchandise, he has been offered cars, watches, toast, clothing and various consumer goods.

Various episodes give snippets of his home life, including his wife Lucy (whose only appearance is in Series 7, episode 2, &quot;Days of Fines and Closures&quot;), daughter Naomi (mentioned in Series 2, episode 10 &quot;The Old School Tie&quot; ), and a dead dog. In a promotional video called &#x27;Number&#x27; made for UK Premium Bonds, where both Dennis Waterman and Glynn Edwards reprise their roles as Terry McCann and Dave &#x27;the barman&#x27;, Dave is referred to as &#x27;Mr Edwards&#x27; and not Harris.

===Police adversaries===
Given the nature of Arthur&#x27;s activities and Terry&#x27;s criminal past, they were always in the spotlight of the local police and crossed paths with several regular and occasional characters:

DS Albert Chisholm; Detective Sergeant Albert &quot;Cheerful Charlie&quot; Chisholm (played by Patrick Malahide) made a brief appearance in the first episode and appeared in another 23 episodes in the first six series. Chisholm frequently arrested Arthur, but was not clever enough to make charges stick. Beginning in Series 3 he was accompanied by:

DC/DS &quot;Taff&quot; Jones; (played by Meic Povey), a Welshman. Although not seeming particularly bright on first sight, Jones often proved mildly sharper than his superior, and was quietly amused by Arthur&#x27;s frequent humiliation of Chisholm, even occasionally going into the Winchester for a social drink, away from Chisholm&#x27;s domination. He tolerated the put-downs of his senior officer with &quot;Celtic willpower and a morbid fear of unemployment&quot;. Jones was promoted to Detective Sergeant in Series 7, with DC MacDonald (Robin Cameron) as his assistant.

DC/DS Ronald Rycott; Detective Constable Ronald &quot;Kenny&quot; Rycott (played by Peter Childs) made his first appearance in Episode 3, &quot;The Smaller They Are&quot;. Rycott previously had a &quot;spot of bother&quot;, which prevented him from rising through the ranks, although he later became a detective sergeant. A lone figure, not afraid of violent situations and more than willing to do a bit of &quot;freelance&quot; work, he was frequently on the edge of a nervous attack as Arthur slipped through his fingers. Rycott appeared in another 14 episodes up to the end of Series 7. His regular assistant was:

DC Melish; (Michael Troughton). DC Melish was, like DC Jones, mainly amused at Arthur&#x27;s activities.

Many episodes in the first seven series featured either Chisholm and Jones or Rycott and Mellish, and the two pairs sometimes appeared together, emphasising the professional rivalry between them, much to the annoyance of their superior officer, Detective (Chief) Inspector Norton (Tony Caunter). This rivalry reached fever pitch in the episode &quot;Around the Corner&quot; (which closed Series 5) when all four officers, in two cars, crashed head-on while attempting to arrest Arthur and Terry. DI Norton&#x27;s subsequent comments were scathing. Although Norton&#x27;s appearances were always brief, they demonstrated the personal nature of Chisholm&#x27;s and Rycott&#x27;s campaigns. In the Series 6 episode &quot;From Fulham with Love&quot; Norton appears for less than a minute, but spends that entire appearance denouncing Chisholm for his &quot;personal vendetta against Arthur Daley&quot;.

In the feature-length episode &quot;An Officer and a Car Salesman&quot; that preceded series 7, Chisholm was written out (he was seen to have taken a job as a security officer), and Jones was promoted to DS. Although he took over the probing of Arthur&#x27;s plots, he was less hell-bent on nabbing him, finding most of Arthur&#x27;s schemes humorous.

New police officers appeared from Series 8:

DS Michael Morley; (Nicholas Day). DS Michael Morley was also a highly driven officer, but tempered with a sense of humour that Chisholm lacked. He also failed to make charges against Arthur stand up in court. His assistants were:

DC Park; (Stephen Tompkinson). DC Johnny Park was openly amused at Arthur and Ray&#x27;s activities, but knew his duty; as did

DC Field; (Jonty Stephens). DC Field was a conscientious officer but he occasionally did Arthur a &quot;good turn&quot;;

DS Rogerson; (James Warrior). DS Richard Rogerson was a loyal and tenacious &quot;old school&quot; officer. On occasion he even assisted Ray to prove that Arthur was innocent of police charges.

===Other characters===
Arthur&#x27;s world was mainly populated by petty crooks, fellow minders, dropouts, &quot;tea leaves&quot; (Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;thieves&quot;), &quot;fences&quot; and those happy to quickly turn over dodgy goods, usually (but not always) without violence. Characters that Arthur would interact with regarding his various dodgy dealings included such characters, often memorably named, as fellow car dealer Wally West, Jewish travel agent-cum-undertaker Monty Wiseman, &quot;Dirty &#x27;Arry&quot;, eternally glum &quot;Mournful Morris&quot;, drunk former surgeon &quot;Incapable&quot;, &quot;Self Inflicted Sid&quot;, Tic-tac&quot;, &quot;Freddy, the Fly&quot;, &quot;Tasty Tim&quot;, &quot;Scotch Harry&quot;, &quot;Maltese Tony&quot;, &quot;Confident Clive&quot;, &quot;Smudger Harris&quot;, a forger of variable talent, unrelated man-with-a-van &quot;Pongo Harris&quot;, &quot;Dipso Pete&quot; and &quot;Oily Wragg&quot; (played by Pete Postlethwaite).

Recurring characters included Des (George Layton) (series 1–3), a back-street mechanic friend of Terry&#x27;s who was friendly and likable, but not beyond car theft when called for; professional gambler Maurice Michaelson (Anthony Valentine) (series 1–2), kind-hearted stripper Debbie Mitchell (Diana Malin) and air stewardess Penny (Gennie Nevinson), both recurring girlfriends of Terry&#x27;s; Ray Winstone as mechanic Arnie (series 4–7, conceived as a replacement for George Layton&#x27;s Des, and as dim as Des was sharp); and wide boy Justin James (Mark Farmer) (series 5–7), who idolised Arthur and aspired to be like him, seeing him as a kind of godfather. Royce Mills also starred as Arthur&#x27;s financial adviser, Andrew, whose character appeared in a number of episodes across several series.

As the series progressed, the guest stars became more prestigious, including Derek Jacobi as criminal Freddy Fenton, Brian Glover as Arthur&#x27;s old army buddy Yorkie, Suzi Quatro as Terry&#x27;s singer girlfriend Nancy, and Michael Kitchen as &quot;Maltese Tony&quot;. Later series starring Cole and Waterman featured Billy Connolly playing Tick-Tack, a bookie and grifter, Brian Blessed as corrupt police officer DI Dyer, Ian McShane as gangster Jack Last, Roy Kinnear as &quot;Fat Charlie&quot; and Andrew Sachs as Sidney.

Indeed, the show gave roles to young actors who have since achieved considerable fame including Brian Cox, Steve McFadden, Peter Capaldi and Bill Nighy.

Arthur frequently mentioned his wife, who was never named or seen and referred to as &quot;&#x27;Er indoors&quot; (Ray would refer to her as &quot;Auntie&quot; in the later series). However, an out-of-focus photograph of bride and groom can be seen in the background of one early episode (&#x27;Bury my Half at Waltham Green&#x27;) in Arthur&#x27;s flat. Their children are occasionally mentioned in passing but no specific details are ever confirmed.

Rula Lenska, who was married to Dennis Waterman, played a number of roles in the show.

===2009 revival characters===
Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Daley is the main character in the 2009 revival. It is never specified whether Archie is related to Arthur or not, but in one scene in the final episode, Archie says &quot;If my uncle Arthur could see me now!&quot; In the specially filmed trailer for the upcoming series, Archie mentions his &quot; Uncle Arthur&quot;. Like Arthur, he is a &quot;wide&quot; businessman, who likes expensive clothing and cars although his tastes are less traditional. Archie tries to get involved in many types of enterprises usually unsuccessfully. Archie is getting divorced from his wife Delilah at the start of the series, but appears to have no children. He seems to have no qualms about having affairs.

Jamie Cartwright is a newly qualified black cab driver, who is good at defending himself. He is less of a womaniser than either Terry or Ray, but still fancies himself as popular with women. He is the &quot;minder&quot; in this version. His Hackney cab is a major feature in many of the plots.

Petra Bennett is a pub landlady. In the first episode of the revival, Archie calls on Jamie to try and get her to sell up for a development organised by an acquaintance of Archie&#x27;s. However, they soon come over to her side after her pub is torched. The bar is refitted at Archie&#x27;s expense and renamed The Winchester. Petra is perhaps the equivalent of Dave from the previous series, but is on better terms with Jamie than Archie. It Is implied that she is the daughter of Dave Harris.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Minder&quot; was devised by writer Leon Griffiths as a vehicle for Dennis Waterman after his success in &quot;The Sweeney&quot;. George Cole&#x27;s wheeler-dealer character is almost secondary, with Arthur assigning Terry a new &quot;minding&quot; job in each episode. A number of early episodes focus on Terry in such assignments, with Arthur remaining in the background. However, as the comedy potential of Cole&#x27;s dodgy-dealing character emerged, as well as the successful on-screen pairing of Waterman and Cole (which proved to be one of the series&#x27; most popular elements), the emphasis increasingly focused more on Arthur&#x27;s exploits, and by a few series into the show&#x27;s life, typical plots revolved more around Arthur&#x27;s latest shady scams instead of some of the more &quot;gritty&quot; plots of Terry&#x27;s minding jobs.

While the show was broadly entertaining, Griffiths -- who was raised in the Communist Party -- always saw it in political terms as well. As he told the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 1984, &quot;Terry is a failure–a loser. So is Arthur. That’s part of the charm of the series. They’re little people. Arthur’s a selfish man, with a self-protective skin. He’s a survivor. To me Arthur is the unacceptable face of private enterprise.&quot;

Despite its eventual success, &quot;Minder&quot; was a slow burner, not helped by being delayed by a technicians&#x27; strike which forced the ITV network off the air for 75 days from 10 August to 24 October 1979. In the light of initially poor viewing figures, management at Thames were intent on scrapping the show but managing director Bryan Cowgill persuaded them to commission one further series and repeat the first. Both attracted much larger audiences and by series 3, the show had become a major hit, and at its peak was often cited as the &quot;jewel in ITV&#x27;s Drama crown&quot;.

===Storylines===
The tone of the programme in series one and two, and much of series three, mixed poignant drama and action sequences with offbeat comic moments, and many of these tales had a grittier feel to them than the more light-hearted storylines that would go on to be more familiar. As the series progressed over 15 years, more emphasis was placed on the comedic aspects of the minder-principal relationship, and the show became more a comedy driven by a dramatic plot. Social satire played a strong part throughout the series, grounded in the cinematic and social ethos of the 1980s. In the earlier series, Terry would succeed in seducing a &#x27;dolly bird&#x27;, resulting in at least one scene of female semi-nudity per average episode, though as the series became more popular these instances were reduced (and some repeat screenings, even those post-watershed, toned such scenes down). Although always an element of the series, the fights - common and brutal in early episodes - were also toned down and became less frequent.

Another significant element of the series were the subplots typically found in a Minder episode. Although subplots were not found in all of the episodes, they were found in most and usually consisted of one of Arthur&#x27;s dodgy deals, Terry&#x27;s minding jobs and/or favours done for friends and in a few instances involved the police tackling particular cases.

The series has a number of parallels with long-running BBC comedy &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Minder&quot;, which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;Minder&quot; were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers in the days before video recorders were commonplace in UK homes.

When the series was first broadcast, some viewers complained about the use of swearing and foul language in the episodes. Even though this gave the storylines a sense of gritty reality, it was noticed that as the series progressed from season to season, the amount of swearing steadily decreased up to the point that when the special episode TV feature film &quot;Minder on the Orient Express&quot; was broadcast, there was practically none at all.

===Recurring features===
As well as heavy use of leading British actors, other features were Arthur&#x27;s constant rhyming slang and other misquoted sayings (one being &quot;the world is your lobster&quot; and &quot;I had a dream&quot;), the derelict sites used as locations, and the episode titles, which contained references to films (e.g. &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Launderette&quot;, &quot;Monday Night Fever&quot;, &quot;National Pelmet&quot;, &quot;The Beer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Days of Fines and Closures&quot;, &quot;The Wrong Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Pinner?&quot;).

===Opening and closing credits===
The show&#x27;s opening credit sequence shows the Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over the sale of the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry&#x27;s credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters&#x27; first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with blue tint) still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along Southend Pier, which is over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter at the other end of the pier and they start to walk back to find it.

The 2009 revival features a very different opening sequence, with a reworked theme tune. Archie Daley is shown putting on his suit and opening a suitcase of money, while Jamie is out driving his Hackney cab.

===Theme tune===
The theme tune, &quot;I Could Be So Good for You&quot;, written in 1979 by Gerard Kenny and Patricia Waterman, was sung by Dennis Waterman. It was released as a single in October 1979, credited to &#x27;Dennis Waterman with the Dennis Waterman Band&#x27;, but failed to enter the charts. It was then re-released in October 1980, upon which it became more successful, peaking at No.3 in the UK Singles Chart in November. The writing credit of Kenny/Waterman often lead people to mis-credit Dennis as co-writer. Dennis Waterman also sang the theme songs to other programmes he starred in, including &quot;On the Up&quot;, &quot;Stay Lucky&quot;, and &quot;New Tricks&quot;, and this led to a parody in &quot;Little Britain&quot; where Dennis Waterman played by David Walliams is offered acting work; he always assumes he will also &quot;write the theme tune, sing the theme tune...&quot;.

Glasgow band Attic Lights re-worked the theme for the 2009 series.

Writer Gerard Kenny has also released his own version of the song, appearing on his 1994 album &quot;Time Between the Time&quot;. A live version of the song sung in duet between Gerard Kenny and Dennis Waterman was released on 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Gerard Kenny – The Singles&quot; album. Also, in 2004, Kenny released yet another album &quot;Coming Home&quot; which featured a &quot;chilled&quot; (and slower) recording of the song as its opening track. Kenny spoke about the composition of the song, including how Dennis Waterman gave his own writing credit to his wife to avoid a contractual obligation, and how he met Waterman in a 2021 interview.

==Reception==
At its peak, the show was one of ITV&#x27;s most popular programmes, even the repeats attracting over 10 million viewers. The highest rated episode was 1984&#x27;s &quot;Second Hand Pose&quot;, with 16.4 million viewers. In 2005, Arthur Daley came second in ITV&#x27;s 50th anniversary poll to find its favourite TV characters.

The show was said a number of times to have come to an end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, &quot;TV Times&quot; reported that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if the current series was the last, and it was off the air (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series appeared to be the last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure at the end of its run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-years, which ended with the 10th series in 1994.

==In other media==

The series inspired a hit single, &quot;Arthur Daley (E&#x27;s Alright!)&quot; by The Firm, which made the UK Top 20 in 1982. George Cole and Dennis Waterman released a Christmas record in 1983 called &quot;What are We Gonna Get &#x27;Er Indoors?&quot; which reached No. 21 in the charts. The duo performed it on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 22 December 1983.

In 1980, an annual based on the series was released by Grandreams. It was based upon the early concept of the series being based around Terry, and made no reference to Arthur. Two further annuals were released by World International Publishing for 1985 and 1986. These annuals featured both Terry and Arthur, with illustrations of both Dennis Waterman and George Cole.

A Leon Griffiths authored book - &quot;Arthur Daley&#x27;s Guide To Doing It Right!&quot;, which included black &amp; white stills from the series, along with caricatures by John Ireland - was published in 1985 by Willow Books, appearing in paperback in 1986 from Fontana.

In 1985, an officially licensed &quot;Minder&quot; computer game was published for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. The player&#x27;s aim was to make money by buying and selling goods, interacting with other characters through a rudimentary conversation system. The game was written by Don Priestley and published by DK&#x27;Tronics.

In 2021, Paul Stenning released a podcast interviewing people involved with the show. Episodes released include interviews with George Layton, Gerard Kenny, Suzi Quatro, Karl Howman and Gennie Nevinson. The podcast referred to Dennis Waterman as a truly underrated actor and following his death, pledged to go off air for 7 weeks, one for each of the Minder series in which Waterman appeared. After seven weeks the show issued an audio tribute episode.

<text>Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla (4 October 1607 – 23 January 1648) was a Spanish dramatist. The main pieces of Rojas Zorrilla are &quot;Del rey abajo ninguno&quot; and &quot;No hay padre siendo rey&quot; (both published in the 1640s).

==Biography==
Rojas Zorrilla was born at Toledo. He became a knight of Santiago in 1644. It is believed that he studied at the University of Toledo and University of Salamanca, and for a time followed a military career.
His plays were published between 1640 and 1645; his greatest dramatic composition, &quot;Del rey abajo ninguno&quot;, was printed separately under the title of &quot;García del Castañar&quot;.

His works were adapted by authors outside Spain. &quot;No hay padre siendo rey&quot; was borrowed by Jean Rotrou for his &quot;Venceslas&quot;. &quot;Donde hay agravios no hay zelos&quot; and the &quot;Amo criado&quot; were imitated by Paul Scarron in his &quot;Jodelet Souffleté&quot; and &quot;Maître Valet&quot;. &quot;Entre Bobos anda el juego&quot; was the source of Thomas Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Don Bertrand de Cigarral&quot;, as well as of Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Don Japhel d&#x27;Arménie&quot;. Four foreign works derive from &quot;Obligados y ofendidos&quot;: &quot;Les Généreux Ennemis&quot; by François le Metel de Boisrobert, &quot;Les Illustres Ennemis&quot; by Thomas Corneille, Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Écolier de Salamanque&quot;, and the story of Count Belflor and Leonor de Cespedes in Alain-René Lesage&#x27;s novel &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot; (1707). &quot;La traición busca el castigo&quot; is the basis of John Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;False Friend&quot; and Lesage&#x27;s &quot;Traître puni&quot;.
