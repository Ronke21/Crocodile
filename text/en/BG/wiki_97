<text>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, often termed &quot;Ich&quot;, is a parasitic ciliate described by the French parasitologist Fouquet in 1876. Only one species is found in the genus which also gave name to the family. The name literally translates as &quot;the fish louse with many children&quot;. The parasite can infect most freshwater fish species and, in contrast to many other parasites, shows low host specificity. It penetrates gill epithelia, skin and fins of the fish host and resides as a feeding stage (the trophont) inside the epidermis. It is visible as a white spot on the surface of the fish but, due to its internal microhabitat, it is a true endoparasite and not an ectoparasite.

It causes a disease commonly referred to as white spot disease due to the macroscopically visible trophonts (up to 1 mm in diameter) in the skin and fins. The trophont, continuously rotating, is surrounded by host cells (epidermal cells and leukocytes), producing a minute elevation of the skin. These light-reflecting nodules are recognized as white spots.

If strict bio-security rules are violated, the parasite may be introduced into a fish rearing unit by transfer of fish or equipment from infected systems. When the organism gets into a large fish culture facility, it is difficult to control due to its fast-reproductive cycle. If not controlled, the infection may lead to 100% mortality in the tank.

Strict management measures including mechanical and chemical methods are generally applied and can keep the infection at an acceptable level at farms. However, these measures are costly in terms of labour, chemicals and lost fish.

Research within the Horizon2020 project ParaFishControl pointed to a range of new approaches for control. For example, the fish immune system has an ability to combat invading parasites and a vaccine may be developed in the future. In addition, novel bacterial products (surfactants from &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;) can directly kill the external stages of the parasite without harming the host.

&quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot; inflicts considerable damage to gills and skin in two ways. Firstly, the theronts penetrate the host epithelia and, when the number of parasites is high in relation to the fish size, the penetration may directly kill the fish by destroying the integrity of the fish surface. Secondly, if the invasion is successful, the invading theronts transform into the trophont stage in the fish epidermis where they develop and expand their volume manifold. When the trophonts burst out from their epidermal residence, severe ulceration follows, leading to high host mortality. The osmoregulation of the fish is challenged both by penetration and by trophont escape. Damage to the host&#x27;s gills also reduces the respiratory efficiency of the fish, reducing its oxygen intake from the water.

==Life cycle==
The life cycle of the parasite is direct, which means that no intermediate hosts are included in transmission. It includes a trophont stage residing in the fish surface (gill epithelia, skin and fin epidermis). This stage is the feeding stage which continuously ingests cellular debris and live host cells in its epidermal location, making the parasite able to grow rapidly over a short time - depending on temperature.

When the trophont has reached a certain size (100-1000 μm), it breaks out of the host epidermis and swim freely as a tomont (also covered by cilia). After minutes to hours, the tomont attaches to any surface in the fishpond or fish tank and produces a thick, gelatinous cyst wall. This is termed the tomocyst stage.

Within the tomocyst, a series of mitotic cell divisions take place and, depending on temperature, up to 1000 resulting daughter cells (tomites) are produced. These escape the tomocyst by penetrating the cyst wall, whereafter they swim in the fish tank water searching for a fish host, which they penetrate fast and efficiently if it is naïve and non-immunized.

This life cycle is highly dependent on water temperature, and the entire life cycle takes from approximately 7 days at 25 °C to 8 weeks at 5-6 °C.

==Pathology and clinical signs==
===Signs and symptoms===
The infection challenges hosts’ osmoregulation and respiration. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections are common due to the disturbance of epithelial linings. When trophonts burst out of the epidermis, non-protected (non-mucous cell lined) cells become accessible to other pathogens.

=== Clinical signs ===
Typical behaviour of clinically infected fish includes:

* Anorexia (loss of appetite)
* Increased breathing rate (hyperventilation)
* Discoloration
* Abnormal behaviour (inactivity, isolation)
* Resting on the bottom
* Flashing (rubbing and scratching against objects)
* Balance disturbance. Upside-down swimming near the surface.
Theront penetration may elicit erratic swimming and movements reflecting irritation of fish surfaces. The trophont is not visible to the naked eye until it has fed on the fish and grown to a diameter of about 0.3-0.5 millimetres. The white spots may reach more than 1 mm in diameter and are easily recognized on skin and fins whereas trophonts attached to the gills are hard to see due to the gill cover (operculum).

Skin: Ich infections are usually visible as one or several characteristic white spots on the body or fins of the fish. The white spots are single cells called trophonts, which feed on host cells (epidermal cells and leukocytes attracted to the site) and may grow to 1 mm in diameter. Heavy infections with subsequent lesions following trophont escape leave the skin irregular, fluffy and greyish.

Gills: Gill infection may cause breathing at the surface and increased ventilation movements of operculae.

===Impact===
Due to the low host specificity of the parasite, Ich infection is known from all freshwater fish systems examined. However, the susceptibility and the impact differ between host species. Rainbow trout, catfish and eels are highly susceptible fish species and uncontrolled infections lead to almost 100% mortality. Some cyprinids, such as zebrafish, have a higher innate protection and may clear the infection faster than other species.

==Diagnosis==
Macroscopically visible trophonts (white spots) on skin or fins is often the basis for a tentative diagnosis of &quot;I. multifiliis&quot; infection. The diagnosis can be confirmed by microscopic examination of skin and gill smears. Scrapings of skin, fins or gill surfaces (using a cover slip or scalpel) and subsequent mounting on a microscope slide with a few drops of water under a cover slip should be examined under the light microscope (20-400 x magnification). The trophont is slowly rotating, covered by rapidly beating cilia and has a prominent, horseshoe-shaped macro-nucleus. Molecular diagnosis can be based on knowledge of genes encoding the parasite&#x27;s i-antigen and is performed by PCR and quantitative real-time PCR.

==Treatments==
=== Chemicals and medicines ===
Various chemotherapeutants can be applied for the treatment of infected fish and infected fish farm systems but caution should always be observed during any treatment. Some drugs are toxic to certain fish species and any treatment method must take into account the species of fish (some do not tolerate certain medications). Malachite green was previously the drug of choice but, due to its carcinogenicity, this organic dye is now banned in some countries. Formalin when applied repeatedly (30–50 mg/L) kills infective theronts and tomonts but, due to its carcinogenicity, other chemotherapeutants should be used. Copper-sulphate, methylene blue and potassium permanganate are effective but questionable from an environmental point of view. Copper may still be applied in some countries, but it is easy to overdose with copper. The recommended dosage is 0.15-0.3 mg/L and the concentration should never exceed 0.4 mg/L. Copper is noticeably more toxic to fish in soft water than in hard water. Drugs such as metronidazole and quinine hydrochloride are effective as well, but require prescription from a veterinary authority.

Environmentally friendly products include hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide releasing products such as sodium percarbonate and peracetic acid. These compounds can be added to the fish tank water and eliminate theronts and tomonts but do not affect the trophont stage in the fish skin. The toxicity of hydrogen peroxide is increased at higher temperatures. Sodium chloride when applied in a concentration of at least 7.5 g/L inhibits production of infective theronts in tomocysts. When used in a concentration of 10 g/L over 14 days, the parasite can be eliminated from a recirculated fish farm system.

Recently, a wide series of herbal extracts have been shown as effective, including garlic juice, which has a toxic effect on theronts and trophonts. Biological control has also demonstrated its potential. A lipopeptide secreted as a surfactant from the bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; H6 has been shown to kill theronts, tomonts and tomocysts. It is not toxic to fish, which suggests that future control can be based on environmentally friendly, natural products.

=== Management ===
Total fish removal and repeated transfer to clean tanks may be applied. Theronts, the motile and fish-infecting stage of the Ich life cycle, exit from the tomocyst at the bottom of the tank. However, without fish to re-attach to, theronts die within 48 hours (at higher temperatures). An effective way to clear Ich from a fish population is to transfer all of the fish carrying trophonts in their skin, fins or gills to a non-infected tank every 24 hours. Then the fish do not get re-infected and after a number of days (dependent on temperature) the fish have cleared the infection because trophonts exit within this period. They do not have sufficient time to produce theronts as 24 h is too short time for released tomonts to develop via tomocysts releasing the infective stage. Under colder water conditions, these management procedures should be continued over a longer time. Another method is to use mechanical filtration of water using mesh sizes of 80 microns. This removes the tomonts from the water before they settle and transform to the tomocyst stage (the multiplication step).

== Other control strategies ==

=== Prevention ===
Priority should be given to avoid introducing the parasite in the first place. New warm-water fish should be quarantined for at least four weeks and cold-water fish for eight weeks. Recognition of biosecurity measures for fish farm personnel including using a biocide foot bath, separate dress for the unit, using separate equipment and disinfecting hands before and after maintenance of each tank, reduces the risk of spreading the parasite between units.

The host response may provide some protection. Fish recovering from an infection are partly protected against reinfection and can resist a new infection. Prevention of the disease by vaccination is, at present, not possible due to the lack of a commercially available vaccine. However, several studies have identified potential vaccine candidate proteins, e.g. i-antigens and others, of the parasite, which suggests that a vaccine can be produced in the future.

== Research ==
Due to the occurrence and impact of &quot;I. multifiliis&quot; in freshwater fish farm systems worldwide, considerable research efforts are being conducted in laboratories worldwide. New drugs and herbal extracts are being tested for their impact on various stages of the parasite.

In the European H2020 supported research project ParaFishControl, a series of control methods have been explored. The parasite can be propagated in the laboratory - most successfully in the hosts (&quot;in vivo&quot;), but also cell cultures can support part of the life cycle (&quot;in vitro&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Experimental vaccines are being tested for future control purposes. Surfactants (with a high parasiticidal effect) from naturally occurring bacteria, such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, are being explored and prepared for marketing. Herbal extracts have been demonstrated to stimulate immune responses of fish (and thereby partly inhibit development of the trophont), such as rainbow trout. Management procedures, based on a basic understanding of the life cycle, can reduce the infection pressure considerably. All together, these approaches can be applied for integrated control of &quot;I. multifiliis&quot; infections in aquacultured fish. Due to the development of aquaculture systems – affecting the life cycle and pathogenicity of the parasites - continued research is needed in order to secure control of this parasitosis also in the future.

<text>Lambeth Palace is the official London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. It is situated in north Lambeth, London, on the south bank of the River Thames, south-east of the Palace of Westminster, which houses Parliament, on the opposite bank.

Close to Westminster and the City, the estate was first acquired by the archdiocese for the archbishop (who also has a residence at Old Palace, Canterbury) around 1200.

==History==

While the original residence of the archbishop of Canterbury was in his episcopal see, Canterbury, Kent, a site originally called the Manor of Lambeth or Lambeth House was acquired by the diocese around AD 1200 (though Archbishop Anselm had a house there a century earlier) and has since served as the archbishop&#x27;s London residence. The site was chosen for its convenient proximity to the royal palace and government seat of Westminster, just across the Thames. The site is bounded by Lambeth Palace Road to the west and Lambeth Road to the south, but unlike all surrounding land is excluded from the parish of North Lambeth. The garden park is listed and resembles Archbishop&#x27;s Park, a neighbouring public park; however, it was a larger area with a notable orchard until the early 19th century. The former church in front of its entrance has been converted to the Garden Museum. The south bank of the Thames along this reach, not part of historic London, developed slowly because the land was low and sodden: it was called Lambeth Marsh, as far downriver as the present Blackfriars Road. The origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as Lambehitha, meaning &#x27;landing place for lambs&#x27; (&#x27;hitha&#x27; or &#x27;hithe&#x27; referring to a landing on the river): archbishops came and went by water, as did John Wycliffe, who was tried here for heresy in 1378. In the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, the palace was attacked. Cardinal Pole lay in state in the palace for 40 days after he died there in 1558. 

The palace was again attacked in May 1640 during a period of popular discontent with the Arminianist theology of the Archbishop, William Laud, in the hope of capturing him. The palace was ransacked and partially demolished by the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War of the 1640s, necessitating major reconstruction, especially of the great hall, in 1660-63. 

New construction was added to the building in 1829–1834 by Edward Blore (1787–1879), who rebuilt much of Buckingham Palace later, in neo-Gothic style and it fronts a spacious quadrangle. Blore&#x27;s large extensions to house the archbishop meant that the original buildings could be converted to the archdiocese&#x27;s library, record office and secretariat. The palace was damaged in the Blitz of 1941. The buildings form the home of the archbishop, who is regarded as the first among equals in the Anglican Communion, and is &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the House of Lords.

== Buildings ==
The building is listed in the highest category, Grade I, for its architecture. The palace consists of two main structures: the residence itself, which is built round a cloister, and Morton&#x27;s Tower, which forms the main entry. The medieval building had three more courtyards, which have since disappeared, as has the moat that surrounded the complex. The unusual inclusion of a cloister may be because Archbishop Hubert Walter initially intended to found a Premonstratensian abbey on the site, before settling on a palace. The original timber cloister, which held the archbishop&#x27;s library, was replaced by the present structure in 1830. The oldest remaining part of the palace is the 13th century chapel which was built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. It stands above a vaulted undercroft, which has a central line of columns. This part had to be heavily restored after the Blitz, so most of its fittings are of 1954-55. The medieval great hall, now gone, appears to have been rebuilt following damage in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. The south end of the hall joined the kitchen and offices, while a stair at the north end led to the archbishop&#x27;s apartments. One 14th century room of these apartments, now known as the Guard Chamber, still stands, with its original elaborate roof. Further private accommodation was added when the Water or Lollards&#x27; Tower, built of Kentish Ragstone with ashlar quoins, was built at the north-west corner in 1434-35. It was extended and heightened later in the century, and again in the early 16th century when Laud&#x27;s Tower was built next to it. At the top of the stair was the Archbishop&#x27;s prison, a room also seen at Winchester Palace in Southwark. The massive five-storey brick gatehouse was built by Cardinal John Morton and completed in 1495 and housed eight lodgings for the Archbishop&#x27;s household. Improvements continued into the 16th century, when Archbishop Cranmer built a brick tower north-east of the chapel to house his study.

The most serious damage done by the Cromwellians in the late 1640s was the demolition of the great hall and the sale of its materials. After the Restoration, it was completely rebuilt by Archbishop William Juxon in 1663 (dated) with a late Gothic hammerbeam roof. The choice of a hammerbeam roof was evocative, as it reflected the High-Church Anglican continuity with the Old Faith (the King&#x27;s (Charles II) brother was an avowed Catholic) and served as a visual statement that the Interregnum was over. As with some Gothic details on University buildings of the same date, it is debated among architectural historians whether this is &quot;Gothic survival&quot; or an early work of the &quot;Gothic Revival&quot;. The diarist Samuel Pepys recognised it as &quot;a new old-fashioned hall&quot;. Major work was done by Blore in 1829-33, with large parts of the medieval palace being rebuilt, and an extensive new wing in Gothic revival style added.

Among the portraits of the archbishops in the palace are works by Hans Holbein, Anthony van Dyck, William Hogarth and Sir Joshua Reynolds.

== Gardens ==

The fig tree in the palace courtyard is possibly grown from a slip taken from one of the &quot;White Marseille&quot; fig trees here for centuries (reputedly planted by Cardinal Pole). In 1786, there were three ancient figs, two &quot;nailed against the wall&quot; and still noted in 1826 as &quot;two uncommonly fine... traditionally reported to have been planted by Cardinal Pole, and fixed against that part of the palace believed to have been founded by him. They are of the white Marseilles sort, and still bear delicious fruit. ...On the south side of the building, in a small private garden, is another tree of the same kind and age.&quot; By 1882, their place had been taken by several massive offshoots. The notable orchard of the medieval period has somewhat given way to a mirroring public park adjoining and built-up roads of housing and offices. The palace gardens were listed grade II in October 1987.

==Library==

Within the palace precincts is Lambeth Palace Library, the official library of the archbishop of Canterbury, and the principal repository of records of the Church of England. It describes itself as &quot;the largest religious collection outside of the Vatican&quot;.

The library was founded as a public library by Archbishop Richard Bancroft in 1610. It was historically located within the main palace complex, but in 2021 a new purpose-built library and repository building opened. This is located at the far end of the palace gardens, with its entrance on Lambeth Palace Road, and was designed by Wright &amp; Wright. In addition to the existing library collections, it houses the archival collections of various Church of England institutions formerly held at the Church of England Record Centre (opened 1989) in Bermondsey.

The library contains an extensive collection of material relating to ecclesiastical history, including the archives of the archbishops dating back to the 12th century, and those of other church bodies and of various Anglican missionary and charitable societies. Manuscripts include items dating back to the 9th century. The library also holds over 120,000 printed books. In 1996, when Sion College Library closed, Lambeth Palace Library acquired its important holdings of manuscripts, pamphlets, and pre-1850 printed books.

Topics covered by the collections range from the history of art and architecture to colonial and Commonwealth history, and numerous aspects of English social, political and economic history. The library is also an important resource for local history and genealogy. For online catalogues, see External links below.

===Highlights of the collection===
Notable items in the collections include:
* Mac Durnan Gospels (late 9th/early 10th centuries)
* Minuscule 473 (11th century)
* Minuscule 559 (11th century)
* Lambeth Apocalypse (12th century)
* The Romanesque Lambeth Bible (12th century)
* Lambeth Homilies ()
* Book of Hours of King Richard III (mid 15th century)
* &quot;A Short English Chronicle&quot; (mid 15th century)
* A rare copy of the Gutenberg Bible (1450s)
* Lambeth Choirbook (16th century)
* Book of Howth (late 16th century)
* Archives of the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches (1711–1759)
* Archives of the Incorporated Church Building Society (1818–1982)

==St Mary-at-Lambeth==
Immediately outside the gatehouse stands the former parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth which was preserved by a campaign led by John and Rosemary Nicholson. The tower dates from 1377 (repaired in 1834); while the body of the church was rebuilt in 1851 to the designs of Philip Hardwick. Older monuments were preserved, including the tombs of some of the gardeners and plantsmen John Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name, and of Admiral William Bligh. St Mary&#x27;s was deconsecrated in 1972, when the parish was absorbed into the surrounding parish of North Lambeth which has three active churches, the nearest being St Anselm&#x27;s Church, Kennington Cross. The Museum of Garden History (now the Garden Museum) opened in the building in 1977, taking advantage of its Tradescant associations.

During renovation works in 2016, a previously unknown crypt was discovered, containing 30 coffins. Amongst these were those of five archbishops of Canterbury—Richard Bancroft, Thomas Tenison, Matthew Hutton, Frederick Cornwallis, and John Moore—as well as that of John Bettesworth, Dean of the Arches.

==Resident community==

Lambeth Palace is home to the Community of Saint Anselm, an Anglican religious order that is under the patronage of the archbishop of Canterbury.

<text>Joseph Burton Sumner (October 11, 1837 – February 15, 1920) was a figure in the founding of Sumner, Mississippi.
Sumner and his family moved to Tallahatchie County, Mississippi from Alabama around January, 1872. J. B. Sumner built the first general store and post office in the town that was later named for him in 1885, where he became the first postmaster. He donated the land for the right-of-way and park to the railroad company in 1888. When Sumner incorporated in 1900, J. B. Sumner was elected the first mayor. He donated the lots for the first jail and the courthouse built in 1902. He taught his own children and the children of his tenants at a school located between Sumner and Webb, Mississippi. Sumner later moved to Bentonville, Arkansas with his daughter.

Before moving to Mississippi Sumner had served in the 22nd AL Volunteer Infantry, Company A in the Confederate States of America Army and was wounded during the operations before the Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro, Tennessee the evening of December 31, 1862.

Sumner is buried in his family cemetery, Indian Mound Cemetery.

<text>The Battle of Quebec () was fought on December 31, 1775, between American Continental Army forces and the British defenders of Quebec City early in the American Revolutionary War. The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it came with heavy losses. General Richard Montgomery was killed, Benedict Arnold was wounded, and Daniel Morgan and more than 400 men were taken prisoner. The city&#x27;s garrison, a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by Quebec&#x27;s provincial governor, General Guy Carleton, suffered a small number of casualties.

Montgomery&#x27;s army had captured Montreal on November 13, and early in December they became one force that was led by Arnold, whose men had made an arduous trek through the wilderness of northern New England. Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec, the Americans&#x27; next objective, and last-minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city&#x27;s limited defenses before the attacking force&#x27;s arrival. Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force, Montgomery made the end-of-year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army&#x27;s movements. The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city. Montgomery&#x27;s force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle, but Arnold&#x27;s force penetrated further into the lower city. Arnold was injured early in the attack, and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender. Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring, when British reinforcements arrived.

==Background==

Shortly after the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, a small enterprising force led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured the key Fort Ticonderoga on May 10. Arnold followed up the capture with a raid on Fort Saint-Jean not far from Montreal, alarming the British leadership there.

These actions stimulated both British and rebel leaders to consider the possibility of an invasion of the Province of Quebec by the rebellious forces of the Second Continental Congress, and Quebec&#x27;s governor, General Guy Carleton, began mobilizing the provincial defenses. The British forces in Canada consisted of three regiments, with the 8th Regiment holding various forts around the Great Lakes and the 7th and 26th regiments guarding the St. Lawrence River Valley. Apart from these regiments, the only forces available to the Crown were about 15,000 men of the militia and the 8,500 or so warriors from the various Indian tribes in the northern district of the Department of Indian Affairs. The largely &quot;Canadien&quot; militia and many of the Indian tribes were regarded as lukewarm in their loyalty to the Crown.

Both the Americans and the British misunderstood the nature of &quot;Canadien&quot; (as French Canadians were then known) society. The feudal nature of &quot;Canadien&quot; society with the &quot;seigneurs&quot; and the Catholic Church owning the land led the British to assume the &quot;habitants&quot; – as the tenant farmers who made up the vast majority of Quebec&#x27;s population were known – would deferentially obey their social superiors while the Americans believed that the &quot;habitants&quot; would welcome them as liberators from their feudal society. In fact, the &quot;habitants&quot;, despite being tenant farmers, tended to display many of the same traits displayed by the farmers in the 13 colonies who mostly owned their land, being described variously as individualistic, stubborn, and spirited together with a tendency to be rude and disrespectful of authority figures if their actions were seen as unjust. Most of the &quot;habitants&quot; wanted to be neutral in the struggle between Congress vs. the Crown, just wanting to live their lives in peace. Carleton&#x27;s romanticized view of &quot;Canadien&quot; society led him to exaggerate the willingness of the &quot;habitants&quot; to obey the &quot;seigneurs&quot; as he failed to understand that the &quot;habitants&quot; would only fight for a cause that they saw as being in their own interests. A large number of the &quot;Canadiens&quot; still clung to the hope that one day Louis XVI would reclaim his kingdom&#x27;s lost colony of New France, but until then, they wanted to be left alone.

The memory of Pontiac&#x27;s War in 1763 had made most of the Indians living in the Ohio River valley, the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River valley distrustful of all whites, and most of the Indians in the region had no desire to fight for either Congress or the Crown. Only the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, living in their homeland of Kaniekeh (modern upstate New York) were regarded as willing to fight for the Crown, and even then some of the Six Nations like the Oneida and the Tuscarora were already negotiating with the Americans. The Catholic Haudenosaunee living outside of Montreal—the so-called Seven Nations of Canada—were traditionally allies of the French and their loyalty to the British Crown was felt to be very shallow. Both Arnold and Allen argued to Congress that the British forces holding Canada were weak, that the &quot;Canadiens&quot; would welcome the Americans as liberators and an invasion would require only 2,000 men. Taking Canada would eliminate any possibility of the British using it as a base to invade New England and New York.

After first rejecting the idea of an attack on Quebec, the Congress authorized the Continental Army&#x27;s commander of its Northern Department, Major General Philip Schuyler, to invade the province if he felt it necessary. On 27 June 1775 approval for an invasion of Canada was given to Schuyler. As part of an American propaganda offensive, letters from Congress and the New York Provincial Assembly were circulated throughout the province, promising liberation from their oppressive government. Benedict Arnold, passed over for command of the expedition, convinced General George Washington to authorize a second expedition through the wilderness of what is now the state of Maine directly to Quebec City, capital of the province. The plan approved by Congress called for a two-pronged attack with 3,000 men under Schuyler going via Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River valley to take Montreal while 1,050 men under Arnold would march up the Kennebec River valley, over the Height of Land and then down the Chaudière River valley to take Quebec City.

The Continental Army began moving into Quebec in September 1775. Richard Montgomery, heading the American vanguard took Ile-aux-Noix on 2 September 1775. Its goal, as stated in a proclamation by General Schuyler, was to &quot;drive away, if possible, the troops of Great Britain&quot; that &quot;under the orders of a despotic ministry ... aim to subject their fellow-citizens and brethren to the yoke of a hard slavery&quot;. On 16 September 1775, the sickly Schuyler handed over the command of his army to Montgomery. Brigadier General Richard Montgomery led the force from Ticonderoga and Crown Point up Lake Champlain, successfully besieging Fort St. Jean, and capturing Montreal on November 13. Arnold led a force of 1,100 men from Cambridge, Massachusetts on the expedition through Maine towards Quebec shortly after Montgomery&#x27;s departure from Ticonderoga.

One significant expectation of the American advance into Quebec was that the large French Catholic &quot;Canadien&quot; population of the province and city would rise against British rule. Since the British took control of the province, during the French and Indian War in 1760, there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local French Catholics and the Protestant English-speaking British military and civilian administrations. However, these tensions had been eased by the passage of the Quebec Act 1774, which restored land and many civil rights to the &quot;Canadiens&quot; (an act which had been condemned by the thirteen rebelling colonies). The English-speaking &quot;Old Subjects&quot; living in Montreal and Quebec City (in contrast to the French-speaking &quot;New Subjects&quot;) came mostly from Scotland or the 13 colonies, and they tried to dominate the Quebec colony both politically and economically, clashing with the long-established &quot;Canadien&quot; elite. James Murray, the first Governor of Quebec, had described the &quot;Old Subject&quot; businessmen who arrived in his colony as &quot;adventurers of mean education ... with their fortunes to make and little Sollicitous about the means&quot;. Carleton for his part felt the complaints by the &quot;Canadiens&quot; about the &quot;Old Subjects&quot; as greedy and unscrupulous businessmen were largely merited. As a member of Ireland&#x27;s Protestant Ascendancy, Carleton found much to admire in Quebec which reminded him of his native Ireland, as both places were rural, deeply conservative Catholic societies. The majority of Quebec&#x27;s French inhabitants chose not to play an active role in the American campaign, in large part because, encouraged by their clergy, they had come to accept British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture.

Many of the &quot;Old Subjects&quot; saw the Quebec Act as a betrayal by the Crown as it granted equality to the &quot;Canadiens&quot;, most notably by allowing Roman Catholic men to vote and hold office, which ended the hopes of the &quot;Old Subjects&quot; to dominate Quebec politically. Many of the English-speaking and Protestant &quot;Old Subjects&quot; were the ones who served as &quot;fifth column&quot; for the Americans rather than the French-speaking Roman Catholic &quot;New Subjects&quot; as the many &quot;Old Subject&quot; businessmen had decided that an American victory was their best hope of establishing Anglo-Protestant supremacy in Quebec. Prominent &quot;Old Subject&quot; businessmen such as Thomas Walker, James Price, William Heywood and Joseph Bindon in Montreal together with John McCord, Zachary Macaulay, Edward Antill, John Dyer Mercier and Udnay Hay in Quebec City all worked for an American victory by providing intelligence and later money for the Continental Army. Much of the American assessment that Canada could be easily taken was based on letters from &quot;Old Subject&quot; businessmen asking for the Americans to liberate them from the rule of the Crown which had given the &quot;Canadiens&quot; equality, and somewhat contradictorily also claiming that the &quot;Canadiens&quot; would rise up against the British if the Americans entered Quebec.

==British preparations==
===Defense of the province===
General Carleton had begun preparing the province&#x27;s defenses immediately on learning of Arnold&#x27;s raid on St. Jean. On 9 June 1775 Carleton proclaimed martial law and called out the militia. At Montreal, Carleton found that there were six hundred men of the 7th Foot Regiment fit for duty, but he complained that there were no warships on the St. Lawrence, the forts around Montreal in a state of disrepair and though the &quot;seigneury&quot; and the Catholic Church were loyal to the Crown, most of the &quot;habitants&quot; appeared indifferent. Although Carleton concentrated most of his modest force at Fort St. Jean, he left small garrisons of British regular army troops at Montreal and Quebec. To provide more manpower, Carleton raised the Royal Highland Emigrants Regiment, whom he recruited from the Scottish Highland immigrants in Quebec. The commander of the Royal Highland Emigrants, Allan Maclean, was a Highlander who had fought for the Jacobites in the rebellion of 1745, and turned out to be Carleton&#x27;s most aggressive subordinate in the campaign of 1775–76. On 26 July 1775, Carleton met Guy Johnson, the superintendent of the northern district of the Indian Department together with an Indian Department official, Daniel Claus, and a Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant. Johnson, Claus and Brant had brought with them some 1,600 warriors whom they proposed to lead into a raid into New England, arguing that this was the best way of keeping the Americans engaged and out of Canada. Carleton declined the offer and ordered most of the Indians home, saying he did not want the Indians involved in this war, whom he regarded as savages who he believed would commit all sorts of atrocities against the white population of New England. Despite his dislike of Indians, whom he considered to be undisciplined and prone to brutality, Carleton employed at least 50 Indians as scouts to monitor the American forces as no one else could operate in the wilderness as scouts as well as the Indians.

Carleton followed the American invasion&#x27;s progress, occasionally receiving intercepted communications between Montgomery and Arnold. Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramahé, in charge of Quebec&#x27;s defenses while Carleton was in Montreal, organized a militia force of several hundred to defend the town in September. He pessimistically thought they were &quot;not much to be depended on&quot;, estimating that only half were reliable. Cramahé also made numerous requests for military reinforcements to the military leadership in Boston, but each of these came to nought. Several troop ships were blown off course and ended up in New York, and Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, the commander of the fleet in Boston, refused to release ships to transport troops from there to Quebec because the approaching winter would close the Saint Lawrence River. On 25 September 1775 an attempt by Ethan Allen to take Montreal in a surprise attack—as the American sympathizer and prominent merchant Thomas Walker had promised he would open the city&#x27;s gates—was foiled. A mixed force of 34 men from the 26th Foot regiment, 120 &quot;Canadien&quot; volunteers and 80 &quot;Old Subject&quot; volunteers, 20 Indian Department employees and six Indians under the command of Major John Campbell stopped Allen&#x27;s force on the outskirts of Montreal, killing 5 of the Americans and capturing 36. The victory caused 1, 200 &quot;Canadiens&quot; to finally respond to the militia summons, but Carleton, knowing only a large American force had entered Canada, chose to stay on the defensive under the grounds he was probably outnumbered. On 5 October, Carleton ordered Walker arrested on charges of high treason, which led to a shoot-out that left two soldiers wounded, Walker&#x27;s house burned down, and Walker captured. On 15 October 1775, heavy guns arrived from Fort Ticonderoga, which finally allowed the American besiegers to start inflicting damage on Fort St. Jean and on 18 October, the fort at Chambly fell to the Americans.

The attempts of the Americans to recruit Canadiens (French-Canadians) for their cause were generally unsuccessful with Jeremy Duggan, an &quot;Old Subject&quot; Quebec City barber who had joined the Americans only recruiting 40 Canadiens. The Roman Catholic clergy preached loyalty to the Crown, but the unwillingness of Carleton to take the offensive persuaded many Canadiens that the British cause was a lost one. Given the American numerical superiority, Carleton had decided to stay on the defensive, a decision which however justified under military grounds, proved to be politically damaging. On 2 November 1775, Montgomery took Fort St. Jean, which the Americans had been besieging since September, causing Carleton to decide to pull back to Quebec City, which he knew that Arnold was also approaching. On 11 November, the British pulled out of Montreal and on 13 November 1775, the Americans took Montreal. Like Carleton, Montgomery was an Irishman, and both generals had a certain understanding and respect for Canadien society, which was in many ways similar to Irish society, going out of their way to be tactful and polite in their dealings with Canadiens. Montgomery insisted that his men display &quot;brotherly affection&quot; for the Canadiens at all times. However, the man that Montgomery placed in charge of Montreal, Brigadier General David Wooster, together with the newly freed Thomas Walker who served as Wooster&#x27;s chief political adviser, displayed bigoted anti-Catholic and anti-French views, with Wooster shutting down all the &quot;Mass houses&quot; as he called Catholic churches just before Christmas Eve, a move that deeply offended the Canadiens. The arbitrary and high-handed behavior of Wooster and Walker in Montreal together with their anti-Catholicism undercut their claims to be promoting &quot;liberty&quot; and did much to turn Canadien opinion against their self-proclaimed &quot;liberators&quot;.

When definitive word reached Quebec on November 3 that Arnold&#x27;s march had succeeded and that he was approaching the city, Cramahé began tightening the guard and had all boats removed from the south shore of the Saint Lawrence. Word of Arnold&#x27;s approach resulted in further militia enlistments, increasing the ranks to 1,200 or more. Two ships arrived on November 3, followed by a third the next day, carrying militia volunteers from St. John&#x27;s Island and Newfoundland that added about 120 men to the defense. A small convoy under the command of the frigate also arrived that day, from which a number of marines were added to the town&#x27;s defenses.

On November 10, Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean, who had been involved in an attempt to lift the siege at St. Jean, arrived with 200 men of his Royal Highland Emigrants. They had intercepted communications from Arnold to Montgomery near Trois-Rivières, and hurried to Quebec to help with its defense. The arrival of this experienced force boosted the morale of the town militia, and Maclean immediately took charge of the defenses.

===Carleton arrives at Quebec===
In the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean, Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship, narrowly escaping capture. Upon his arrival on November 19, he immediately took command. Three days later, he issued a proclamation that any able-bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy, and would be treated as such. Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave. As a result, about 500 inhabitants (including 200 British and 300 Canadians) joined the defense.

Carleton addressed the weak points of the town&#x27;s defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along the walls and the inner defenses; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.

==Arnold&#x27;s arrival==

The British believed that the forbidding landscape of upper Massachusetts (modern Maine) was impassable to a military force, but General Washington felt that the upper Massachusetts could be crossed in about 20 days. Arnold called for 200 bateaux (boats) and for &quot;active woodsmen, well acquainted with bateaux&quot;. After recruiting 1,050 volunteers, Arnold departed for Quebec City on 5 September 1775. The men Arnold chose for his expedition were volunteers drawn from New England companies serving in the Siege of Boston. They were formed into two battalions for the expedition; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia under Captain Daniel Morgan&#x27;s command. After landing in Georgetown on 20 September, Arnold began his voyage up the Kennebec river. Arnold thought it was only to Quebec City, but actually the distance was and the terrain was far more difficult than he expected.

The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult with icy rains, dysentery caused by drinking unclean waters, and rivers full of drowned trees all presenting problems. The conditions were wet and cold, and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected. Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition&#x27;s food stores, and about 500 men of the original 1,100 turned back or died. Those who turned back, including one of the New England battalions, took many of the remaining provisions with them. The men who continued on were starving by the time they reached the first French settlements in early November. By the time they reached the Chaudière River, Arnold&#x27;s men were eating their leather shoes and belts, and upon encountering the first &quot;habitant&quot; settlements on 2 November, they were overjoyed to be offered meals of beef, oatmeal and mutton, though they complained that the &quot;Canadiens&quot; charged too much for their food. On 3 November, the frigate HMS &quot;Lizard&quot; arrived in Quebec City with 100 men from Newfoundland. On 8 November, Arnold could see for the first time the walls of Quebec City towering over the St. Lawrence. On November 9, the 600 survivors of Arnold&#x27;s march from Boston to Quebec arrived at Point Levis, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River opposite Quebec City. Despite the condition of his troops, Arnold immediately began to gather boats to make a crossing. Arnold was prepared to do so on the night of November 10, but a storm delayed him for three days. An Indian chief greeted Arnold, and agreed to provide him with canoes to cross the St. Lawrence River together with some 50 men to serve as guides. On 12 November, MacLean with his Highlanders arrived in Quebec City. Starting about 9 pm on 13 November, the Americans crossed the St. Lawrence in canoes to land at Wolfe&#x27;s Cove, and by 4 am, about 500 men had crossed over. Once on the other side of the St. Lawrence, Arnold moved his troops onto the Plains of Abraham, about from the city walls.

The troops approaching Quebec&#x27;s walls were significantly under-equipped. Arnold had no artillery, each of his men carried only five cartridges and the men&#x27;s clothing had been reduced to rags. Despite being outnumbered two to one, Arnold demanded the city&#x27;s surrender. Both envoys sent were shot at by British cannons, (&quot;killing the messenger&quot; has historically been viewed as an unusual and very contradictory, if not rogue, breach of war protocol as emissaries were not supposed to be undertaking a suicide march but strictly deliver a message of demands or negotiations and come back to their leaders unmolested, with a reply; either a refusal or counter offer.) Their death clearly signified that the demand had been rebuked. At a council of war called by Cramahé on 16 November, MacLean as the most senior military officer present advocated for holding out. MacLean stated that Quebec City had a garrison of 1,178 men and had enough food and firewood for both the garrison and the civilian population to last all through the winter. Arnold concluded that he could not take the city by force, so he blockaded the city on its west side. An inventory ordered by Arnold revealed that over 100 muskets had been so damaged by exposure to the elements during the trek through the wildness that they were now useless. On November 18, the Americans heard a (false) rumor that the British were planning to attack them with 800 men. At a council of war, they decided that the blockade could not be maintained, and Arnold began to move his men upriver to Pointe-aux-Trembles (&quot;Aspen Point&quot;) to wait for Montgomery, who had just taken Montreal. Henry Dearborn, who later became U.S. Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson, was present at the battle and wrote his famous journal, &quot; The Quebec Expedition&quot;, which outlined the long and difficult march to the battle and the events that occurred there.

==Montgomery&#x27;s arrival==
On December 1, Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles. His force consisted of 300 men from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd New York regiments, a company of artillery raised by John Lamb, about 200 men recruited by James Livingston for the 1st Canadian Regiment, and another 160 men led by Jacob Brown who were remnants of regiments disbanded due to expiring enlistments. These were supplemented several days later by a few companies detached by Major General David Wooster, whom Montgomery had left in command at Montreal. The artillery Montgomery brought included four cannons and six mortars, and he also brought winter clothing and other supplies for Arnold&#x27;s men; the clothing and supplies were a prize taken when most of the British ships fleeing Montreal were captured. Arnold was unpopular with his men, and when Montgomery arrived, several of Arnold&#x27;s captains asked that they be transferred over serving under Montgomery.

The commanders quickly turned towards Quebec, and put the city under siege on December 6. Montgomery sent a personal letter to Carleton demanding the city&#x27;s surrender, employing a woman as the messenger. Carleton declined the request and burned the letter unread. Montgomery tried again ten days later, with the same result. The besiegers continued to send messages, primarily intended for the populace in the city, describing the situation there as hopeless, and suggesting that conditions would improve if they rose to assist the Americans. Carleton gave the command of his British Army soldiers, the marines and the Royal Highlanders to MacLean; the sailors to Captain John Hamilton of the Royal Navy; the English-speaking militiamen to Henry Caldwell and the &quot;Canadien&quot; militiamen to Noël Voyer. While the British began to fortify the Lower Town of Quebec City, Montgomery used his five mortars to begin bombarding Quebec City while American riflemen were assigned as snipers to gun down the soldiers patrolling the walls of Quebec City. Many of the enlistments of Montgomery&#x27;s force expired on 31 December 1775, and despite his efforts to persuade his men to stay on, it was made clear by the Continental Army soldiers that they intended to go home once their enlistments ended. As December advanced, Montgomery was under increasing pressure to take Quebec City before 31 December.

On December 10, the Americans set up their largest battery of artillery from the walls. The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks. This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence. Montgomery realized he was in a very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city&#x27;s defenses. On 17 December, British cannons knocked out two of Montgomery&#x27;s mortars, leading him to order the remaining three back. The enlistments of Arnold&#x27;s men were expiring at the end of the year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either have to act or withdraw. Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected. On Christmas Day, Montgomery announced in speech before his army his plans to take Quebec City.

While Montgomery planned the attack on the city, Christophe Pélissier, a Frenchman living near Trois-Rivières, came to see him. Pélissier was a political supporter of the American cause who operated the St. Maurice Ironworks. He and Montgomery discussed the idea of holding a provincial convention to elect representatives to Congress. Pélissier recommended against this until after Quebec City had been taken, as the habitants would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured. The two agreed that Pélissier&#x27;s ironworks would provide munitions (ammunition, cannonballs, and the like) for the siege. This, Pélissier did until the Americans retreated in May 1776, at which time he also fled with them, His ironworks supplied ammunition, bombs, and cannonballs for the siege of Quebec; he also wrote a letter to the Second Continental Congress on January 8, 1776, to point out the measures they should take for a successful taking of Quebec. As the Americans retreated from Quebec in May and June 1776, Pélissier fled the province with them. On July 29, 1776, he received an engineering lieutenant colonel&#x27;s commission in the Continental Army, and in October assisted in the improvement of the defenses at Fort Ticonderoga. He eventually returned to his family home in France.

A snowstorm arrived on the night of December 27, prompting Montgomery to prepare the troops for the attack. However, the storm subsided, and Montgomery called off the assault. That night, a sergeant from Rhode Island deserted, carrying the plan of attack to the British. Montgomery consequently drafted a new plan; this one called for two feints against Quebec&#x27;s western walls, to be led by Jacob Brown and James Livingston, while two attacks would be mounted against the lower town. Arnold would lead one attack to smash through the defenses at the north end of the Lower town through the Sault au Matelot and Montgomery would follow along the Saint Lawrence south of the Lower Town. The two forces would meet in the lower town and then launch a combined assault on the upper town by scaling its walls, believing that the &quot;Old Subject&quot; merchants living in the Upper Town would force Carleton to surrender upon the Upper Town was entered. Much of the hope behind Montgomery&#x27;s plan was their either the &quot;Old Subject&quot; merchants would force Carleton to surrender once the Americans entered the city and/or the threat of having the warehouses destroyed would lead to the city&#x27;s merchants likewise compelling Carleton to surrender. The new plan was revealed only to the senior officers. On the afternoon of 30 December 1775, a &quot;nor&#x27;easter&quot; came from the Atlantic, bringing in a heavy snowfall, and Montgomery knowing that much of his army would be leaving in two days&#x27; time, ordered his men to form up for an assault on Quebec City.

==Battle==

===Montgomery&#x27;s attack===
A storm broke out on December 30, and Montgomery once again gave orders for the attack. Brown and Livingston led their militia companies to their assigned positions that night: Brown by the Cape Diamond redoubt, and Livingston outside St. Jean&#x27;s gate. When Brown reached his position between 4 am and 5 am, he fired flares to signal the other forces, and his men and Livingston&#x27;s began to fire on their respective targets. Montgomery and Arnold, seeing the flares, set off for the lower town.

Montgomery led his men from Wolfe&#x27;s Cove down the steep, snow-heaped path towards the outer defenses. The storm had turned into a blizzard, making the advance a struggle. As they advanced over the ice-covered rocky ground, the bells of the Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church began to ring, signaling the militiamen to arm themselves, as sentries manning the walls of Quebec City saw the American lanterns in the blizzard. Montgomery&#x27;s men eventually arrived at the palisade of the outer defenses, where an advance party of carpenters sawed their way through the wall. Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade, and led 50 men down a street towards a two-story building. The building formed part of the city&#x27;s defenses, and was in fact a blockhouse occupied by 39 Quebec militia and 9 sailors armed with muskets and cannons.

Montgomery unsheathed his sword as he led his men down the street as the blizzard raged. The defenders opened fire at close range, and Montgomery was killed instantly, shot through the head by a burst of grapeshot while most of the men standing beside him were either killed or wounded. The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade; only Aaron Burr and a few others escaped unhurt. As the next two most senior officers, John Macpherson and Jacob Cheesemen, were also killed, command was assumed by the deputy quartermaster, Colonel Donald Campbell, who decided it was suicidal to try to advance again. Many of Montgomery&#x27;s officers were injured in the attack; one of the few remaining uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham, leaving Montgomery&#x27;s body behind.

===Arnold&#x27;s attack===
While Montgomery was making his advance, Arnold advanced with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at the northern end of the lower town. Leading Arnold&#x27;s advance were 30 riflemen together with the artillerymen who attached a brass 6-pounder cannon to a sled. Behind them were the rest of the riflemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania, then the Continental Army volunteers from New England, and finally the rearguard consisted of those &quot;Canadiens&quot; and Indians from the Seven Nations of Canada who had decided to join the Americans.

They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected. However, as the advance party moved around the &quot;Porte du Palais&quot; (Palace Gate), heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them. The defenders opened fire with their muskets and hurled grenades down from the walls. The sled carrying the cannon was struck in a snowdrift in an attempt to avoid the hostile fire and was abandoned. The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders&#x27; fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward to the docks of Quebec City that were not behind the walls. In the process, the Americans became lost amid the unfamiliar streets of Quebec City and the raging blizzard.

They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade manned by 30 &quot;Canadien&quot; militiamen armed with three light cannons. Arnold had planned to use the cannon he brought with him, but since the gun was lost, he had no choice but to order a frontal attack. As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted, and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan. Morgan, a tough Virginia frontiersman well respected by his men, personally led the assault, scaling a ladder up the barricade and was knocked down on his first attempt. On his second attempt, Morgan made to the top of the barricade, had to roll under one of the cannons to escape the bayonets of the defenders, but the rest of his men followed up. After a few minutes of fighting, the 30 militiamen surrendered while the Americans had lost 1 dead and six wounded.

Under Morgan&#x27;s command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Moreover, despite Morgan&#x27;s exhortations to advance, his men were afraid of being overpowered by their prisoners and wanted to wait for the rest of the Continental Army force to come up, leading to a 30-minute delay. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town.

Caldwell was speaking with Carleton when he learned of the assault on the &quot;Porte du Palais&quot;, and took with him 30 Royal Highland Emigrants and 50 sailors as he headed out to stop the assault. At the second barricade, he found some 200 &quot;Canadien&quot; militiamen under Voyer and a company from the 7th Foot Regiment, who were confused about what was going on, whom he gave his orders to. Caldwell ordered the Royal Highlanders and the militia into the houses while ordering the 7th Foot to form a double line behind 12-foot high barricade. As Morgan and his men advanced down the narrow streets of Quebec City, they were confronted by the sailors led by a man named Anderson who demanded their surrender. Morgan in reply shot Anderson dead while his sailors retreated; shouting &quot;Quebec is ours!&quot;, Morgan then led a charge down the street. The Royal Highlanders and the militia opened fire from the windows in the houses. Despite the storm of bullets raining down on them, the Americans were able to place ladders against the barricades, but their attempts to scale it were all beaten back. An attempt to outflank the barricade by going through one of the houses led to a savage fight in the house with bayonet against bayonet, but was also repulsed. Under increasing heavy fire, Morgan ordered his men into the houses.

A British force of 500 sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city. Captain George Laws led his 500 men, consisting of Royal Highlanders and sailors out of the Palace Gate, when they encountered an American force under Henry Dearborn who was coming up to aid Morgan. As Dearborn&#x27;s men had their powder damp, they could not use their muskets and Dearborn and the rest of his men surrendered. Laws then turned against Morgan&#x27;s group, who proved to be more stubborn. Laws himself was captured, but the attempts of the Americans to break out were blocked. As the fighting continued, the Americans ran out of ammunition and one by one, groups of Continental Army soldiers gave up the fight. With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10 am. Morgan was the last to surrender and rather than give up his sword to a British officer, he handed it to a Catholic priest who had been sent under a flag of truce to ask for his surrender. Finally, Carleton ordered an assault on the battery outside the walls, which was captured, and afterwards the British withdrew back behind the safety of the walls. Found on the American corpses in the snow were paper streamers attached to their hats reading &quot;Liberty or Death!&quot;.

This was the first defeat suffered by the Continental Army. Carleton reported 30 Americans killed and 431 taken prisoner, including about two-thirds of Arnold&#x27;s force. He also wrote that &quot;many perished on the River&quot; attempting to get away. Allan Maclean reported that 20 bodies were recovered in the spring thaw the following May. Arnold reported about 400 missing or captured, and his official report to Congress claimed 60 killed and 300 captured. British casualties were comparatively light. Carleton&#x27;s initial report to General William Howe mentioned only five killed or wounded, but other witness reports ranged as high as 50. Carleton&#x27;s official report listed five killed and 14 wounded.

General Montgomery&#x27;s body was recovered by the British on New Year&#x27;s Day 1776 and was given a simple military funeral on January 4, paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramahé. The body was returned to New York in 1818. Together with the losses taken in the battle and the expiring enlistments left Arnold with only 600 men as 1 January 1776 to besiege Quebec City. Arnold asked for David Wooster, commanding the Continental Army force in Montreal to send him some of his men, but Wooster refused, saying he was afraid of a pro-British uprising if he were to send away any of his forces. An appeal to help for Schuyler led to the reply that he could spare no men as the problem of expiring enlistments led him short of men, and moreover, Guy Johnson had succeeded in persuading some of the Mohawk to fight for the Crown. General Washington complained that the refusal of Congress to offer long-term enlistments or even bounties to those whose enlistments were about to expire was threatening to hobble the rebellion, and led him to consider resigning.

==Siege of the fortress==

Arnold refused to retreat; despite being outnumbered three to one, the sub-freezing temperature of the winter and the mass departure of his men after their enlistments expired, he laid siege to Quebec. The siege had relatively little effect on the city, which Carleton claimed had enough supplies stockpiled to last until May. Immediately after the battle, Arnold sent Moses Hazen and Edward Antill to Montreal, where they informed General Wooster of the defeat. They then travelled on to Philadelphia to report the defeat to Congress and request support. (Both Hazen and Antill, English-speakers originally from the Thirteen Colonies who had settled in Quebec, went on to serve in the Continental Army for the rest of the war.) In response to their report, Congress ordered reinforcements to be raised and sent north. During the winter months, small companies of men from hastily recruited regiments in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut made their way north to supplement the Continental garrisons at Quebec and Montreal. The journey to Quebec City in the winter left the reinforcements in poor health and many of their weapons unserviceable. Arnold used his remaining artillery to shell Quebec City, which caused some damage, but did little did to weaken Carleton&#x27;s hold as Arnold only destroyed the homes of civilians. Carleton continued to build new blockhouses and trenches over the course of the winter and cut a trench in the frozen St. Lawrence to prevent an attempt to outflank the walls of Quebec City.

The presence of disease in the camp outside Quebec, especially smallpox, took a significant toll on the besiegers, as did a general lack of provisions. Smallpox ravaged Montgomery and Arnold&#x27;s forces largely due to exposure to infected civilians released from Quebec. Governor Carleton condoned this practice, realizing it would severely weaken the American siege effort. Carleton is reported to have sent out several prostitutes infected with smallpox who in turn passed it on to the Continental Army. Arnold after using up all his gold could only pay for supplies with paper money, not coin, which proved to be problematic as the &quot;habitants&quot; wanted coins, and increasingly the Americans had to take supplies at bayonet point. Together with the news of the anti-Catholic policies carried out by Wooster in Montreal, the requisitions of food and firewood made the besiegers more and more unpopular with the &quot;habitants&quot; who wanted the Americans to go home. In early April, Arnold was replaced by General Wooster, who was himself replaced in late April by General John Thomas.

Governor Carleton, despite appearing to have a significant advantage in manpower, chose not to attack the American camp, and remained within Quebec&#x27;s walls. Montgomery, in analysing the situation before the battle, had observed that Carleton served under James Wolfe during the 1759 siege of Quebec, and knew that the French General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm had paid a heavy price for leaving the city&#x27;s defenses, ultimately losing the city and his life in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. British General James Murray had also lost a battle outside the city in 1760; Montgomery judged that Carleton was unlikely to repeat their mistakes. On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence, reached Quebec City and informed Carleton there were 200 men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans. These men and more were mobilized to make an attack on an American gun battery at Point Levis, but an advance guard of this Loyalist militia was defeated in the March 1776 Battle of Saint-Pierre by a detachment of pro-American local militia. under Major Lewis Dubois On 2 April 1776, a new battery built by the Americans at Point Lévis started to shell Quebec City and ships in the St. Lawrence as the river thawed in the spring.

To rally support in Quebec, Congress sent a three-man commission consisting of Charles Carroll, Samuel Chase and Benjamin Franklin together with a pro-Patriot Catholic priest, Father John Carroll, and Fleury Mesplet, a French printer living in Philadelphia. On 29 April 1776, the commission arrived in Montreal and attempted to undo the damage done by Wooster, but found that public opinion had turned against them. Several &quot;Canadien&quot; leaders pointedly asked the commissioners that if the rebellion was justified because of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;, then why had Wooster imposed taxes on them in the name of Congress without their representation in Congress. Father Carroll talked extensively with his fellow Catholic priests in Quebec in a bid to win their support, but reported that the majority were satisfied with the Quebec Act, and were unwilling to support the rebellion. Though the Congressional commissioners rescinded Wooster&#x27;s anti-Catholic decisions and allowed Catholic churches to re-open, by then the political damage could not be repaired.

When General Thomas arrived, the conditions in the camp led him to conclude that the siege was impossible to maintain, and he began preparing to retreat. On 3 May, the Americans sent a fireship down the St. Lawrence in an attempt to burn down the Queen&#x27;s Wharf, but British artillery sank the fireship. The arrival on May 6 of a small British fleet carrying 200 regulars (the vanguard of a much larger invasion force), accelerated the American preparations to depart. Arriving in Quebec City were the frigates HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; and HMS &quot;Isis&quot; carrying the 29th Foot Regiment as well as marines. The retreat was turned into a near rout when Carleton marched these fresh forces, along with most of his existing garrison, out of the city to face the disorganized Americans. The American forces, ravaged by smallpox (which claimed General Thomas during the retreat), eventually retreated all the way back to Fort Ticonderoga. Carleton then launched a counteroffensive to regain the forts on Lake Champlain. Although he defeated the American fleet in the Battle of Valcour Island and regained control of the lake, the rear guard defense managed by Benedict Arnold prevented further action to capture Ticonderoga or Crown Point in 1776.

==Aftermath==
On May 22, even before the Americans had been completely driven from the province, Carleton ordered a survey to identify the Canadians who had helped the American expedition in and around Quebec City. François Baby, Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau, and Jenkin Williams travelled the province and counted the Canadians who actively provided such help; they determined that 757 had done so. Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders, and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behaviour. However, once the Americans had been driven from the province, measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher, with a frequent punishment being forced labour to repair infrastructure destroyed by the Americans during their retreat. These measures had the effect of minimizing the public expression of support for the Americans for the rest of the war. Still, some &quot;Canadiens&quot; continued to fight for the Revolution as the Continental Army retreated from Quebec. Under Hazen and Livingston, several hundred men remained in the ranks and, now deprived of their property and means along the St. Lawrence, relied on army pay and the promise of a pension from Congress to survive. Some obtained land grants in northern New York at war&#x27;s end.

Between May 6 and June 1, 1776, nearly 40 British ships arrived at Quebec City. They carried more than 9,000 soldiers under the command of General John Burgoyne, including about 4,000 German auxiliaries from Brunswick and Hesse-Hanau (so-called Hessians) under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel. These forces, some of which having participated in Carleton&#x27;s counteroffensive, spent the winter of 1776–77 in the province, putting a significant strain on the population, which numbered only about 80,000. Carleton told the &quot;habitants&quot; that the quartering of the British and Brunswick troops was punishment for their &quot;disloyalty&quot; in not coming out in greater numbers when he summoned the militia. The Canadian historian Desmond Morton described Carleton as having &quot;wisely&quot; avoided battle outside of Quebec City in 1775–76, but overall his command in the campaign of 1775–76 was &quot;lack-lustre&quot;, which led to John Burgoyne being given command of the invasion of New York in 1777. Many of these troops were deployed in 1777 for Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign for the Hudson Valley.

Following the American victory at the battle of Saratoga, Congress once again considered invading Canada and in January 1778 voted for another invasion to be commanded by the Marquis de La Fayette. However, La Fayette found the necessary supplies and horses to support an invasion were lacking once he reached Albany and he advised cancelling the operation, advice that Congress accepted in March 1778. The news that the British had strengthened the forts on the border together with the walls of Montreal and of Quebec City meant that an invasion of Canada would require a substantial number of men and resources that were not available owing to operations elsewhere. Quebec City&#x27;s status as one of the strongest fortified cities in North America meant it would require a massive amount of force to take. The idea of invading Canada continued to be debated in Congress up to 1780, but no decision was ever made. During the peace negotiations in Paris in 1782–83 for ending the American Revolutionary War, the American delegation asked for the cession of Canada (at the time, the term Canada applied only to what is now southern Quebec and southern Ontario) to the United States. As the Americans did not have possession of Canada at the time, the British refused and the American diplomats did not press the point. Had the Americans been victorious at the battle of Quebec, and were still in possession of Canada at the time of the peace negotiations, the American diplomats in Paris might have been more successful in demanding what is now southern Ontario and southern Quebec become part of the United States.

Three current United States Army National Guard units (Company A of the 69th Infantry Regiment, the 181st Infantry Regiment, and the 182nd Infantry) trace their lineage to American units that participated in the Battle of Quebec.

<text>As I Lay Dying is a 1930 Southern Gothic novel by American author William Faulkner. Faulkner&#x27;s fifth novel, it is consistently ranked among the best novels of the 20th century. The title is derived from William Marris&#x27;s 1925 translation of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, referring to the similar themes of both works.

The novel uses a stream-of-consciousness writing technique, multiple narrators, and varying chapter lengths. The work will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026.

==Plot summary==
The book is narrated by 15 different characters over 59 chapters. It is the story of the death of Addie Bundren and her poor, rural family&#x27;s quest to honor her wish to be buried in her hometown of Jefferson, Mississippi as well as the motives—noble or selfish—they show on the journey.

In the novel&#x27;s opening chapters, Addie is alive but in ill health. She expects to die soon and sits at a window watching as her firstborn child, Cash, builds her coffin. Anse, Addie&#x27;s husband, waits on the porch, while their daughter, Dewey Dell, fans her mother in the July heat. The night after Addie dies, a heavy rainstorm sets in; rivers rise and wash out bridges that the family will need to cross to get to Jefferson.

The family&#x27;s trek by wagon begins, with Addie&#x27;s non-embalmed body in the coffin. Along the way, Anse and the five children encounter various difficulties. Stubborn Anse frequently rejects any offers of assistance, including meals or lodging, so at times the family goes hungry and sleeps in barns. At other times he refuses to accept loans from people, claiming he wishes to &quot;be beholden to no man&quot;, thus manipulating the would-be lender into giving him charity as a gift not to be repaid.

Jewel, Addie&#x27;s middle child, tries to leave the family after Anse sells Jewel&#x27;s most prized possession, his horse. Yet Jewel cannot turn his back on his father and siblings through the tribulations of the journey to Jefferson. Cash breaks a leg and winds up riding atop the coffin. He stoically refuses to admit to any discomfort but the family eventually puts a makeshift cast of concrete on his leg. Twice, the family almost loses Addie&#x27;s coffin—first, while crossing a river on a washed-out bridge (two mules are lost) and then when a fire of suspicious origin starts in the barn where the coffin is being stored for the night.

After nine days, the family arrives in Jefferson, where the stench from the coffin is quickly smelled by the townspeople. In town, family members have different items of business to take care of. Cash&#x27;s broken leg needs attention. Dewey Dell, for the second time in the novel, goes to a pharmacy, to obtain an abortion that she does not know how to ask for; clerk Skeet MacGowan coerces her into sex in the cellar in exchange for &quot;abortion pills&quot; which are just talcum powder. First, though, Anse wants to borrow some shovels to bury Addie, because that was the purpose of the trip and the family should be together for that. After that happens, Darl, the second eldest and thoughtful, poetic observer of the family, is seized for the arson of the barn and sent to the Mississippi State Insane Asylum in Jackson. With Addie only just buried, Anse forces Dewey Dell to give up the money from Lafe (the man who got her pregnant) for an abortion, which he spends on getting &quot;new teeth&quot; and quickly marries the woman from whom he borrowed the shovels.

As are many of Faulkner&#x27;s works, the story is set in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, which Faulkner referred to as &quot;my apocryphal county&quot;, a fictional rendition of the writer&#x27;s home of Lafayette County in the same state.

==Characters==
* Addie Bundren – Addie is married to Anse and the mother of Cash, Darl, Jewel, Dewey Dell, and Vardaman.
* Anse Bundren – Anse is Addie&#x27;s husband, later her widower. He is the father of all the children but Jewel.
* Cash Bundren – Cash is a skilled and helpful carpenter and the eldest son of the family. In his late twenties, he builds Addie&#x27;s coffin. Throughout the novel, he builds an attachment to his tools and proves to be heroic, but to a fault.
* Darl Bundren – The second eldest of Addie&#x27;s children, Darl is about two years younger than Cash. Darl is the most articulate character in the book; he narrates 19 of the 59 chapters. Much of the plot is fueled and narrated by Darl as, throughout the book, he descends into insanity.
* Jewel Bundren – Jewel is the third of the Bundren children, most likely around nineteen years of age. A half-brother to the other children and the favorite of Addie, he is the illegitimate son of Addie and Reverend Whitfield. No one, other than Addie, seems to know this.
* Dewey Dell Bundren – Dewey Dell is the only daughter of Anse and Addie Bundren; at seventeen years old, she is the second youngest of the Bundren children. She was impregnated by Lafe and, as the family journeys to Jefferson, she unsuccessfully seeks an abortion.
* Vardaman Bundren – Vardaman is the youngest Bundren child, somewhere between seven and ten years old.
* Vernon Tull – Vernon is a good friend of the Bundrens, who appears in the book as a good farmer, less religious than his wife.
* Cora Tull – Cora is the wife of Vernon Tull. She is very religious and judgmental.
* Eula Tull – Cora and Vernon&#x27;s daughter.
* Kate Tull – Cora and Vernon&#x27;s other daughter.
* Peabody – Peabody is the Bundrens&#x27; doctor; he narrates two chapters of the book. Anse sends for him shortly before Addie&#x27;s death, too late for Peabody to do anything more than watch Addie die. Toward the end of the book, when he is working on Cash&#x27;s leg, Peabody candidly assesses Anse and the entire Bundren family from the perspective of the community at large. Dr. Peabody is also a recurring character in the Yoknapatawpha County universe.
* Lafe – Lafe is a farmer who has impregnated Dewey Dell and given her $10 to get an abortion.
* Reverend Whitfield – Whitfield is the local minister with whom Addie had an affair, resulting in the birth of Jewel.
* Samson – Samson is a local farmer who lets the Bundren family stay with him the first night on their journey to Jefferson. Samson&#x27;s wife, Rachel, is disgusted with the way the family is treating Addie by dragging her coffin through the countryside.
* Other narrators: MacGowan, Moseley, and Armstid

== Background and literary techniques ==
Faulkner said that he wrote the novel from midnight to 4:00 a.m. over the course of six weeks and that he did not change a word of it. Faulkner spent the first eight hours of his twelve-hour shift at the University of Mississippi Power House shoveling coal or directing other works and the remaining four hours handwriting his manuscript on unlined onionskin paper.

Throughout the novel, Faulkner presents 15 points of view, each chapter narrated by one character, including Addie, who expresses her thoughts after she has already died. In 59 chapters titled only by their narrators&#x27; names, the characters are developed gradually through each other&#x27;s perceptions and opinions, with Darl&#x27;s predominating.

&quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; helped to solidify Faulkner&#x27;s reputation as a pioneer, like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, of stream of consciousness. He first used the technique in &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, and it gives &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; its distinctly intimate tone, through the monologues of the Bundrens and the passers-by whom they encounter. Faulkner manipulates conventional differences between stream of consciousness and interior monologue. For example, Faulkner has a character such as Darl speak in an interior monologue with far more intellectual diction (and knowledge of his physical environment) than he realistically possesses. This represents an innovation on conventions of interior monologues; as Dorrit Cohn states in &quot;Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction&quot;, the language in an interior monologue is &quot;like the language a character speaks to others ... it accords with his time, his place, his social station, level of intelligence ...&quot; The novel represents a progenitor of the Southern Renaissance, reflecting on being, existence, and other existential metaphysics of everyday life.

== Significance ==

&quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; is consistently ranked among the best novels of 20th-century literature. The novel has been reprinted by the Modern Library, the Library of America, and numerous publishers, including Chatto and Windus in 1970, Random House in 1990, Tandem Library in 1991, Vintage Books in 1996, and the Folio Society in 2013. Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949 for his novels prior to that date, with this book being among them.

The novel has also directly influenced a number of other critically acclaimed books, including British author Graham Swift&#x27;s 1996 Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;Last Orders&quot;, Suzan-Lori Parks&#x27;s &quot;Getting Mother&#x27;s Body&quot;, and Jesmyn Ward&#x27;s &quot;Sing, Unburied, Sing&quot;.

The Grammy-nominated metalcore band As I Lay Dying derived its name from the novel.

The character of Darl Bundren later appeared in Faulkner&#x27;s 1935 short story &quot;Uncle Willy&quot;.

== Theatre adaptation ==
An adaptation of the novel by Edward Kemp was staged by the Young Vic company in May 1998.

<doc id="322307" wikidata="Q835804" url="?curid=322307" title="Sonne (Rammstein song)">
<text>&quot;Sonne&quot; (German for &quot;sun&quot;) is a song by German metal band Rammstein. It was released in 2001, as the first single from their album &quot;Mutter&quot;. According to Till Lindemann, the song was originally written as an entrance song for the boxer Vitali Klitschko, whose surname was also the working title of the song. The female vocal comes from Spectrasonic&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Voices&quot; sample library.
The music video for the band&#x27;s 2019 single &quot;Deutschland&quot; features a piano-based version of &quot;Sonne&quot; in the ending credits.

==Music video==
The video features the band as the Seven Dwarfs mining gold for Snow White. According to Paul Landers in the &quot;Making of Sonne&quot;, the idea came from a video made by Oliver Riedel, who mixed the song with parts of &quot;Snow White.&quot; The role of Snow White was played by Yulia Stepanova. 

==Live performances==

The song debuted as &quot;Klitschko&quot; on 16 April 2000. It was very different from the final version released in &quot;Mutter&quot;. It was played in some concerts on the Japanese/Australia-New Zealand leg of the &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; tour, before &quot;Mutter&quot; was released and its tour started. These concerts were the only time the third verse of the song was played; when played live, the band usually omits the final stanza, and instead plays a slightly longer intro and outro.

==Track listing==
*The single is also available as a 2-track CD, featuring &quot;Sonne&quot; and &quot;Adios&quot;.

<doc id="322310" wikidata="Q1399183" url="?curid=322310" title="Alan Colmes">
<text>Alan Samuel Colmes (September 24, 1950 – February 23, 2017) was an American radio and television host, liberal political commentator for the Fox News Channel, and blogger. 

From 1996 to 2009, Colmes served as the co-host, along with Sean Hannity, of &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, a nightly political debate show on Fox News Channel. He was the host of &quot;The Alan Colmes Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated talk-radio show distributed by Fox News Radio that was broadcast throughout the United States on Fox News Talk on Sirius and XM. Beginning in 2015, Colmes supplied the voice of The Liberal Panel on Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Greg Gutfeld Show&quot;.

In addition to broadcasting, Colmes ran the Liberaland blog and contributed to AOL News. He was the author of &quot;Red, White &amp; Liberal: How Left Is Right and Right Is Wrong&quot; (2003) and &quot;Thank the Liberals for Saving America&quot; (2012).

==Early life and education==
Colmes was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. He grew up in Lynbrook, New York on Long Island, attended local public schools and went to Hofstra University, where he graduated in 1971 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from its School of Communications. While at Hofstra, he worked at its radio station, WVHC, which later became WRHU.

==Early career==
Colmes began his career in comedy. He developed his radio career in the Northeast, eventually working at stations such as WABC, WNBC, WHN, WMCA and WEVD in New York, WNHC in New Haven, Connecticut, and WEZE and WZLX in Boston.

His radio career took off when WABC hired him for the morning drive time slot. He was billed as &quot;W. Alan B. Colmes&quot;, as in the station&#x27;s call sign. He moved to WNBC in 1987, but his tenure there would be short when NBC announced in 1988 it would close its radio division. When WNBC went off the air for the last time on October 7, 1988, Colmes&#x27; was the last voice heard. He had been syndicated nationally, starting with his involvement with Daynet, a venture created by Colmes and other regional radio hosts. Daynet was sold to Major Networks, Inc. in 1994. 

==Fox News==
Colmes was hired by Fox News chief executive officer Roger Ailes in 1996. He was the co-host of &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes,&quot; beginning with the Fox News Channel launch on October 6, 1996, and ending on January 9, 2009.

Colmes kept his radio show, which was distributed by Fox News Radio. 

Colmes&#x27; debut non-fiction book, &quot;Red, White &amp; Liberal: How Left is Right and Right is Wrong&quot; (), was published in October 2003. It tackles issues such as civil rights, the war on terror, and the perceived liberal media bias. Interspersed throughout are actual emails from &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot; viewers, reprinted verbatim.

Colmes left &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, with Fox replacing it with &quot;Hannity&quot;, in January 2009. Colmes continued as a commentator on Fox News, most often on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; where he frequently appeared with his conservative sister-in-law, Monica Crowley. He was also an occasional guest-panelist on Fox News&#x27; late-night satire program &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot;.

After &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Colmes was a frequent panelist on the news analysis program &quot;Fox News Watch&quot; alongside Cal Thomas, Judith Miller, and other pundits.

==Criticism==
While Colmes described himself as a liberal and his Fox News biography touted him as &quot;a hard-hitting liberal&quot;, he has sometimes been referred to disparagingly as a &quot;token liberal&quot; or a &quot;Fox News liberal&quot;. Colmes told &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1995 that he considered himself &quot;quite moderate&quot;. In an article he wrote in 2013, Colmes described himself as &quot;very liberal&quot;.

During his run on &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Colmes was criticized for being less charismatic and telegenic than Sean Hannity, and just a &quot;seat-filler&quot; for the liberal side. Some newspapers reported him as being Hannity&#x27;s &quot;sidekick&quot;. Former Democratic Senator Al Franken criticized Colmes in his book &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;, saying he refused to ask tough questions during debates and neglected to challenge erroneous claims made by Hannity or his guests. Franken used a smaller font in his book when he addressed &quot;Colmes&quot; by name and claimed that Colmes did not speak as much as Hannity during the show. Some liberal critics questioned whether both hosts received equal time to interview guests. Some of Colmes&#x27; liberal critics, notably commentators at Media Matters for America, praised him toward the end of the show&#x27;s run. He began to cite their reports in interviews with some conservative guests on the program.

Bob Garfield, interviewing Colmes for &quot;On the Media&quot; in 2003, asked him if he was &quot;the human straw man&quot; and a &quot;foil&quot; rather than an equal of Hannity. Colmes replied that if the conservative members of the audience saw him that way, that was &quot;their problem&quot;, and said &quot;It&#x27;s more fun for me to be in a situation like this than to preach to the choir.&quot;

==In popular culture==
On January 5, 2009, the beginning of his last week on &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, Colmes was a guest on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in a spoof called &quot;Colbert &amp; Colmes&quot;, which parodied criticisms of &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;. In addition to being given a list of pre-approved responses to Stephen Colbert&#x27;s opinions and forced to sit on a stool (making him appear shorter than his co-host), Colmes&#x27; face was covered by the on-air graphics while Colbert discussed issues of the day. Colbert &quot;fired&quot; Colmes by the end of the show for pointing out fallacies in his logic.

Following Colmes&#x27; announcement that he was leaving &quot;Hannity &amp; Colmes&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; also paid tribute to him with a guest appearance by rock duo Hall &amp; Oates, who in a parody version of their hit &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, dubbed him &quot;Tango to his (Hannity&#x27;s) Cash&quot; and &quot;Laurel to his Hardy&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Colmes was married to Jocelyn Elise Crowley, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University, whose sister is Monica Crowley, the conservative radio commentator, pundit, television personality, and former Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs for the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

Colmes died of lymphoma at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan on February 23, 2017, at the age of 66.

<doc id="322317" wikidata="Q17083572" url="?curid=322317" title="Economic data">
<text>Economic data are data describing an actual economy, past or present. These are typically found in time-series form, that is, covering more than one time period (say the monthly unemployment rate for the last five years) or in cross-sectional data in one time period (say for consumption and income levels for sample households). Data may also be collected from surveys of for example individuals and firms or aggregated to sectors and industries of a single economy or for the international economy. A collection of such data in table form comprises a data set.

Methodological economic and statistical elements of the subject include measurement, collection, analysis, and publication of data. &#x27;Economic statistics&#x27; may also refer to a subtopic of official statistics produced by official organizations (e.g. statistical institutes, intergovernmental organizations such as United Nations, European Union or OECD, central banks, ministries, etc.). Economic data provide an empirical basis for economic research, whether descriptive or econometric. Data archives are also a key input for assessing the replicability of empirical findings and for use in decision making as to economic policy.

At the level of an economy, many data are organized and compiled according to the methodology of national accounting. Such data include Gross National Product and its components, Gross National Expenditure, Gross National Income in the National Income and Product Accounts, and also the capital stock and national wealth. In these examples data may be stated in nominal or real values, that is, in money or inflation-adjusted terms. Other economic indicators include a variety of alternative measures of output, orders, trade, the labor force, confidence, prices, and financial series (&quot;e.g.,&quot; money and interest rates). At the international level there are many series including international trade, international financial flows, direct investment flows (between countries) and exchange rates.

For time-series data, reported measurements can be hourly (e.g. for stock markets), daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually. Estimates such as averages are often subjected to seasonal adjustment to remove weekly or seasonal-periodicity elements, for example, holiday-period sales and seasonal unemployment.

Within a country the data are usually produced by one or more statistical organizations, &quot;e.g.,&quot; a governmental or quasi-governmental organization and/or the central banks. International statistics are produced by several international bodies and firms, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.

Studies in experimental economics may also generate data, rather than using data collected for other purposes. Designed randomized experiments may provide more reliable conclusions than do observational studies. Like epidemiology, economics often studies the behavior of humans over periods too long to allow completely controlled experiments, in which case economists can use observational studies or quasi-experiments; in these studies, economists collect data which are then analyzed with statistical methods (econometrics).

Many methods can be used to analyse the data. These include, &quot;e.g.,&quot; time-series analysis using multiple regression, Box–Jenkins analysis, and seasonality analysis. Analysis may be univariate (modeling one series) or multivariate (from several series). Econometricians, economic statisticians, and financial analysts formulate models, whether for past relationships or for economic forecasting. These models may include partial equilibrium microeconomics aimed at examining particular parts of an economy or economies, or they may cover a whole economic system, as in general equilibrium theory or in macroeconomics. Economists use these models to understand past events and to forecast future events, &quot;e.g.,&quot; demand, prices and employment. Methods have also been developed for analyzing or correcting results from use of incomplete data and errors in variables.

==Economic data issues==

Good economic data are a precondition to effective macroeconomic management. With the complexity of modern economies and the lags inherent in macroeconomic policy instruments, a country must have the capacity to promptly identify any adverse trends in its economy and to apply the appropriate corrective measure. This cannot be done without economic data that is complete, accurate and timely.

Increasingly, the availability of good economic data is coming to be seen by international markets as an indicator of a country that is a promising destination for foreign investment. International investors are aware that good economic data is necessary for a country to effectively manage its affairs and, other things being equal, will tend to avoid countries that do not publish such data.

The public availability of reliable and up-to-date economic data also reassures international investors by allowing them to monitor economic developments and to manage their investment risk. The severity of the Mexican and Asian financial crises was made worse by the realization by investors that the authorities had hidden a deteriorating economic situation by slow and incomplete reporting of critical economic data. Being unsure of exactly how bad the economic situation was, they tried to withdraw their assets quickly and in the process caused further damage to the economies in question. It was the realization that data issues lay behind much of the damage done by these international financial crises that led to the creation of international data quality standards, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

Inside a country, the public availability of good quality economic data allows firms and individuals to make their business decisions with confidence that they understand the overall macroeconomic environment. As with international investors, local business people are less likely to overreact to a piece of bad news if they understand the economic context.

Tax data can be a source of economic data. In the United States, the IRS provides tax statistics, but the data are limited by statutory limitations and confidentiality concerns.

<doc id="322332" wikidata="Q12646565" url="?curid=322332" title="Experience curve effects">
<text>In industry, models of the learning or experience curve effect express the relationship between experience producing a good and the efficiency of that production, specifically, efficiency gains that follow investment in the effort. The effect has large implications for costs and market share, which can increase competitive advantage over time.

==History: from psychological learning curves to the learning curve effect==

An early empirical demonstration of learning curves was produced in 1885 by the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. Ebbinghaus was investigating the difficulty of memorizing verbal stimuli. He found that performance increased in proportion to experience (practice and testing) on memorizing the word set. (More detail about the complex processes of learning are discussed in the Learning curve article.) 

===Wright&#x27;s law and the discovery of the learning curve effect===
This was later more generalized to: the more times a task has been performed, the less time is required on each subsequent iteration. This relationship was probably first quantified in the industrial setting in 1936 by Theodore Paul Wright, an engineer at Curtiss-Wright in the United States. Wright found that every time total aircraft production doubled, the required labor time for a new aircraft fell by 20%. This has become known as &quot;Wright&#x27;s law&quot;. Studies in other industries have yielded different percentage values (ranging from only a couple of percent up to 30%), but in most cases, the value in each industry was a constant percentage and did not vary at different scales of operation. The learning curve model posits that for each doubling of the total quantity of items produced, costs decrease by a fixed proportion. Generally, the production of any good or service shows the learning curve or experience curve effect. Each time cumulative volume doubles, value-added costs (including administration, marketing, distribution, and manufacturing) fall by a constant percentage.

The phrase &quot;experience curve&quot; was proposed by Bruce D. Henderson, the founder of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), based on analyses of overall cost behavior in the 1960s. While accepting that the learning curve formed an attractive explanation, he used the name &quot;experience curve&quot;, suggesting that &quot;the two are related, but quite different.&quot; In 1968, Henderson and BCG began to emphasize the implications of the experience curve for strategy. Research by BCG in the 1960s and 70s observed experience curve effects for various industries that ranged from 10% to 25%.

==Wright&#x27;s law unit cost curve==
Mathematically, Wright&#x27;s law takes the form of a power function. Empirical research has validated the following mathematical form for the unit cost &quot;Cx&quot; of producing the xth unit, starting with unit &quot;C1&quot;, for a wide variety of products and services: 

:formula_1, 

where &quot;b&quot; is the &quot;progress ratio&quot; and 1-&quot;b&quot; = &quot;l&quot; is the proportion reduction in the unit cost with each doubling in the cumulative production (&quot;learning rate&quot;). To see this, note the following: 

:formula_2

The exponent &quot;b&quot; is a statistical parameter and thus does not exactly predict the unit cost of producing any future unit. However, it has been found to be useful in many contexts. Across numerous industries (see below), estimates of &quot;b&quot; range from 0.75 to 0.9 (i.e., 1-&quot;b&quot; ranges from 0.1 to 0.25).

The unit curve was expressed in slightly different nomenclature by Henderson:

:formula_3
where:
* &quot;C&quot;1 is the cost of the first unit of production
* &quot;Cn&quot; is the cost of the &quot;n&quot;-th unit of production
* &quot;n&quot; is the cumulative volume of production
* &quot;a&quot; is the elasticity of cost with regard to output

These effects are often expressed graphically. The curve is plotted with the cumulative units produced on the horizontal axis and unit cost on the vertical axis. The BCG group used the value of b to name a given industry curve. Thus a curve showing a 15% cost reduction for every doubling of output was called an &quot;85% experience curve&quot;.

A third formulation of Wright&#x27;s Law is used by a group of innovation investment analysts, working with cumulative average cost per unit and cumulative numbers of units produced.

==Reasons for the effect==
The primary reason for why experience and learning curve effects apply is the complex processes of learning involved. As discussed in the Learning curve article, learning generally begins with making successively larger finds and then successively smaller ones. The equations for these effects come from the usefulness of mathematical models for certain somewhat predictable aspects of those generally non-deterministic processes.

They include:

* Labor efficiency: Workers become physically more dexterous. They become mentally more confident and spend less time hesitating, learning, experimenting, or making mistakes. Over time they learn short-cuts and improvements. This applies to all employees and managers, not just those directly involved in production.
* Standardization, specialization, and methods improvements: As processes, parts, and products become more standardized, efficiency tends to increase. When employees specialize in a limited set of tasks, they gain more experience with these tasks and operate at a faster rate.
* Technology-driven learning: Automated production technology and information technology can introduce efficiencies as they are implemented and people learn how to use them efficiently and effectively.
* Better use of equipment: As total production has increased, manufacturing equipment will have been more fully exploited, lowering fully accounted unit costs. In addition, purchase of more productive equipment can be justifiable.
* Changes in the resource mix: As a company acquires experience, it can alter its mix of inputs and thereby become more efficient.
* Product redesign: As the manufacturers and consumers have more experience with the product, they can usually find improvements. This filters through to the manufacturing process. A good example of this is Cadillac&#x27;s testing of various &quot;bells and whistles&quot; specialty accessories. The ones that did not break became mass-produced in other General Motors products; the ones that didn&#x27;t stand the test of user &quot;beatings&quot; were discontinued, saving the car company money. As General Motors produced more cars, they learned how to best produce products that work for the least money.
* Network-building and use-cost reductions (network effects): As a product enters more widespread use, the consumer uses it more efficiently because they&#x27;re familiar with it. One fax machine in the world can do nothing, but if everyone has one, they build an increasingly efficient network of communications. Another example is email accounts; the more there are, the more efficient the network is, the lower everyone&#x27;s cost per utility of using it.
* Shared experience effects: Experience curve effects are reinforced when two or more products share a common activity or resource. Any efficiency learned from one product can be applied to the other products. (This is related to the principle of least astonishment.)

For some examples, NASA quotes the following progress ratios in experience curves from different industries:

* Aerospace: 85%
* Shipbuilding: 80-85%
* Complex machine tools for new models: 75–85%
* Repetitive electronics manufacturing: 90–95%
* Repetitive machining or punch-press operations: 90–95%
* Repetitive electrical operations: 75–85%
* Repetitive welding operations: 90%
* Raw materials: 93–96%
* Purchased parts: 85–88%

==Experience curve discontinuities==
Graphically, the curve is truncated. Existing processes become obsolete and the firm must upgrade to remain competitive. The upgrade will mean the old experience curve will be replaced by a new one. This occurs when:

* Competitors introduce new products or processes that demand a response
* Key suppliers have much bigger customers that determine the price of products and services, and that becomes the main cost driver for the product
* Technological change requires a change in processes to remain competitive
* The experience curve strategies must be re-evaluated because
** they are leading to price wars
** they are not producing a marketing mix that the market values

==Strategic consequences of the effect==
Henderson wrote on the development of the experience curve. According to Henderson, BCG&#x27;s first &quot;attempt to explain cost behavior over time in a process industry&quot; began in 1966. The datum he focused on was the striking correlation between competitive profitability and market share. Using price data in the semiconductor industry supplied by the Electronic Industries Association, he suggested that not one but two patterns emerged.

&quot;In one pattern, prices, in current dollars, remained constant for long periods and then began a relatively steep and long continued decline in constant dollars. In the other pattern, prices, in constant dollars, declined steadily at a constant rate of about 25 percent each time accumulated experience doubled. That was the experience curve.&quot;

The suggestion was that failure of production to show the learning curve effect was a risk indicator. The BCG strategists examined the consequences of the experience effect for businesses. They concluded that because relatively low cost of operations is a very powerful strategic advantage, firms should invest in maximizing these learning and experience effects and that market share is underestimated as an enabler of this investment. The reasoning is that increased activity leads to increased learning, which leads to lower costs, which can lead to lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was suggested that if a company cannot get enough market share to be competitive, it should exit that business and concentrate resources where it was possible to take advantage of experience effects and gain (preferably dominant) market share. The BCG strategists developed product portfolio techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.

One consequence of experience curve strategy is that it predicts that cost savings should be passed on as price decreases rather than kept as profit margin increases. The BCG strategists felt that maintaining a relatively high price, although very profitable in the short run, spelled disaster for the strategy in the long run. High profits would encourage competitors to enter the market, triggering a steep price decline and a competitive shakeout. If prices were reduced as unit costs fell (due to experience curve effects), then competitive entry would be discouraged while market share increases should increase overall profitability.

==Criticisms==
Ernst R. Berndt claims that in most organizations, experience effects are so closely intertwined with economies of scale (efficiencies arising from an increased scale of production) that it is impossible to separate the two. In practice, this view suggests, economies of scale coincide with experience effects (efficiencies arising from the learning and experience gained over repeated activities). The approach, however, accepts the existence of both as underlying causes. Economies of scale afford experience and experience may afford economies of scale.

Approaches such as Porter&#x27;s generic strategies based on product differentiation and focused market segmentation have been proposed as alternative strategies for leadership that do not rely on lower unit costs.

Attempts to use the learning curve effect to improve competitive advantage, for instance by pre-emptively expanding production have been criticized, with factors such as bounded rationality and durable products cited as reasons for this.

The well travelled road effect may lead people to overestimate the effect of the experience curve.

<doc id="322333" wikidata="Q1004103" url="?curid=322333" title="Stratford, Prince Edward Island">
<text>Stratford is a town located in Queens County, Prince Edward Island.

Situated immediately southeast of the city of Charlottetown, Stratford recorded a population of 10,927 in the 2021 census. The town is the third-largest municipality in the province and has experienced population growth in recent decades since improvements were made to the Hillsborough River Bridge connecting the town with Charlottetown.

==Amalgamation==
Southport was incorporated in 1972, with a main road named &quot;Stratford Road,&quot; after the secondary name that had competed with Southport as the village name more than a century earlier.

On April 1, 1995, the incorporated communities of Bunbury, Cross Roads, Keppoch-Kinlock, and Southport amalgamated to form the Town of Stratford. At the same time, the amalgamated Stratford annexed a small portion of the Lot 48 township. The legislation designated the new town as Charlottetown South but that name did not survive long and the town&#x27;s renaming became controversial as municipal leaders opted to choose a name that had no historic connection to the predecessor constituent communities. It is derived from the Stratford Road, a suburban road connecting Bunbury via Southport with Cross Roads. When the provincial government decided to amalgamate the communities around Southport into a town in 1995, a vote of residents on the new municipality&#x27;s name resulted in the choice of &quot;Stratford.&quot;

Stratford&#x27;s constituent communities each have had slightly different development patterns. The shoreline of the Hillsborough River in Southport was historically a cottage area for city residents, with cottage development proceeding to Keppoch during the postwar era. Cross Roads, Bunbury, Rosebank and Kinlock were historically agricultural communities.

==Geography==

The town is situated on a peninsula formed by the Hillsborough River estuary, Charlottetown Harbour, and Hillsborough Bay - a sub-basin of the Northumberland Strait. It is located in the township of Lot 48.

==History==
Stratford&#x27;s location across the Hillsborough River from the provincial capital, Charlottetown, has made it an important gateway to the eastern part of the province throughout its history. In early times there had been Mi&#x27;kmaq summer camping areas, and during the French regime several families were recorded in the 1752 census at Anse de St-Pierre (in the area later called Keppoch).

Upon the confirmation of British possession of the Island by the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the Island was divided into 67 townships, called &quot;lots.&quot; Present-day Stratford is mostly in Lot 48, with the southern portion of the town in Lot 49.

The area&#x27;s fortunes, historically have been and remain tied to the evolution and development of transportation links with Charlottetown. While the area initially grew a slower pace as a farming community, its first significance was as part of the essential transportation connection between Charlottetown and the Kings County seat, Georgetown, whose port was ice-free and open for shipping more weeks of the year. The Georgetown Road, built by the statute labour of local men aged 16 to 60, and male prisoners sentenced to &quot;hard labour,&quot; was a vital link that began at the south side of the Hillsborough River.

By the 1820s, a small ferry service opened to bring passengers, animals, and goods between Ferry Point in Southport to a wharf on the Charlottetown waterfront. The location across from the capital city where it landed became locally known as &quot;the Ferry&quot;. During the winter months, horse-drawn sleighs would operate directly across the river, if its waters were frozen.

As settlers arrived in the 19th century, many of them tenant farmers, land was cleared, and the constituent communities of present-day Stratford grew. Most of the early area place-names were originally the names of single farms or homes: Bellevue, Bunbury, Rosebank, Keppoch, Kinlock.

The locally known name for the area changed from &quot;the Ferry&quot; to &quot;Southport,&quot; referring to its proximity to Charlottetown, and Southport remained the community name until 1994. However, the name &quot;Stratford&quot; was proposed in the 1850s by Major J. P. Beete, a wealthy and eccentric Englishman who owned property in Lot 48. This competed with &quot;Southport&quot; for about 25 years until Major Beete returned to England.

By mid-century, the village of Southport expanded as roads were improved, and churches and schools grew along with mills, blacksmith shops, and road-houses. Several brick-makers flourished by filling the need for more substantial, fire-resistant buildings.

The Southport Ferry evolved from simple paddle-craft to a small steam-boat that brought people, animals and goods across the province&#x27;s major river with departures every half-hour from each side. As the appeal of summer homes grew, Keppoch and Rosebank became popular cottage areas.

In 1905, the Prince Edward Island Railway constructed the first Hillsborough River Bridge between Charlottetown and Southport, allowing for train travel to the eastern side of the river. Horse-drawn carriages and sleighs (and later automobiles) were also permitted on the span when trains were not operating, although it was only 1-lane wide with wood planks placed between and on each side of the rails.

The opening of the Hillsborough Bridge between Charlottetown and Southport in 1905 caused a decline in business around the ferry wharf. While dairy and potato farmers, market gardeners, and livestock breeders of cows, horses and silver foxes continued to flourish, during the next 50 years the number of small, mixed farms rapidly declined as the land was bought for housing developments. A two-lane highway bridge replaced the old railway bridge across the river in 1961. The increased ease of automobile traffic contributed to further residential growth on the south side of the river, with permanent year-round dwellings and several subdivisions beginning to replace the seasonal cottages which fronted the Hillsborough River.

By the 1980s, commuter and residential development patterns in PEI were changing and it became apparent that the traffic levels on the new 2-lane Hillsborough River Bridge were surpassing its designed capacity. The 1962-era 2-lane bridge was expanded to a 4-lane bridge with new approach routes in 1995 as a sub-contract to the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project (the Confederation Bridge) with cost-sharing between the federal and provincial governments. The expanded Hillsborough River Bridge was completed in the mid-1990s at around the same time as municipal amalgamation took place.

The current town of Stratford is experiencing growth as a result of the improved highway connection to Charlottetown, where most residents work. The development now includes new subdivisions, a waterfront area, a highway commercial district, and several municipal buildings including a town hall and community centre. 

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Stratford had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
== Notable people ==
*Henry Bayfield (1795-1885), spent a distinguished career as a hydrographer for the Royal Navy, as surveyor of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence River, and Atlantic coastline. Based in Charlottetown from 1841, where he retired in 1856, Bayfield later enjoyed summers at his substantial cottage in the Keppoch beach community.
*Francis Haszard (1849-1930), was born at Bellevue, Lot 49, a place named after the home of his Loyalist grandfather and early settler, William Haszard. He was described by the Toronto &quot;Globe&quot; as &quot;an able lawyer, a keen debater, and one with a wide knowledge on most subjects, who believes that anything worth doing is worth doing well.&quot; He served as Island Premier in a Liberal administration from 1908 to 1911.
*John Walter Jones (1878-1954), of Bunbury Farm, Bunbury, a well-known breeder of purebred Holstein cattle and silver foxes, was known as the &quot;Farmer Premier&quot; when he headed the government between 1943 and 1953. While a Member of the Legislative Assembly in 1937, at the annual meeting of the PEI Dairymen&#x27;s Association he gave &quot;an address on &#x27;Let&#x27;s go to the cow stable,&#x27; in which he described feeding problems.&quot;
*Sarah Steele (1995–present), played women&#x27;s ice hockey with Canada&#x27;s entry at the 2013 IIHF World Women&#x27;s U18 Championship, winning a gold medal. She would also compete at the NCAA level with the Boston University Terriers women&#x27;s ice hockey program, graduating in 2017. She would also play professionally in Europe, skating in the European Women&#x27;s Hockey League with clubs such as Vienna, Austria&#x27;s EHV Sabres, the Swiss League&#x27;s Neuchâtel Hockey Academy Dames, plus Hungary&#x27;s KMH Budapest squad, winning the Supercup, OB1 Hungarian League and EWHL championships during the 2019–20 season.

<doc id="322334" wikidata="Q34340" url="?curid=322334" title="Sotho language">
<text>Sotho () &quot;Sesotho&quot;, also known as Southern Sotho or &quot;Sesotho sa Borwa&quot; is a Southern Bantu language of the Sotho–Tswana (&quot;S.30&quot;) group, spoken in Lesotho, and South Africa where it is an official language.

Like all Bantu languages, Sesotho is an agglutinative language that uses numerous affixes and derivational and inflexional rules to build complete words.

==Classification==
Sotho is a Southern Bantu language belonging to the Niger–Congo language family within the Sotho-Tswana branch of Zone S (S.30).

&quot;Sotho&quot; is also the name given to the entire Sotho-Tswana group, in which case Sesotho proper is called &quot;Southern Sotho&quot;. Within the Sotho-Tswana group, Southern Sotho is also related to Lozi (&quot;Silozi&quot;), with which it forms the Sesotho-Lozi group within Sotho-Tswana.

The Northern Sotho group is geographical, and includes a number of dialects also closely related to Sotho-Lozi. Tswana is also known as &quot;Western Sesotho&quot;.

The Sotho-Tswana group is in turn closely related to the other Southern Bantu languages, including the Venda, Tsonga, Tonga, Lozi which is native to Zambia and the other surrounding Southern African countries and Nguni languages, and possibly also the Makua (zone P) languages of Tanzania and Mozambique.

&quot;Sotho&quot; is the root word. Various prefixes may be added for specific derivations, such as &quot;Sesotho&quot; for the Sotho language and &quot;Basotho&quot; for the Sotho people. Use of &quot;Sesotho&quot; rather than &quot;Sotho&quot; for the language in English has seen increasing use since the 1980s, especially in South African English and in Lesotho.

==Dialects==

Except for faint lexical variation within Lesotho, and for marked lexical variation between the Lesotho/Free State variety and that of the large urban townships to the north (such as Soweto) due to heavy borrowing from neighbouring languages, there is no discernible dialect variation in this language.

However, one point that seems to often confuse authors who attempt to study the dialectology of Sesotho is the term &quot;Basotho&quot;, which can variously mean &quot;Sotho–Tswana speakers&quot;, &quot;Southern Sotho and Northern Sotho speakers&quot;, &quot;Sesotho speakers&quot;, and &quot;residents of Lesotho.&quot; The Nguni language Phuthi has been heavily influenced by Sesotho; its speakers have mixed Nguni and Sotho–Tswana ancestry. It seems that it is sometimes treated erroneously as a dialect of Sesotho called &quot;Sephuthi.&quot; However, Phuthi is mutually unintelligible with standard Sesotho and thus cannot in any sense be termed a dialect of it. The occasional tendency to label all minor languages spoken in Lesotho as &quot;dialects&quot; of Sesotho is considered patronising, in addition to being linguistically inaccurate and in part serving a national myth that all citizens of Lesotho have Sesotho as their mother tongue.

Additionally, being derived from a language or dialect very closely related to modern Sesotho, the Zambian Sotho–Tswana language Lozi is also sometimes cited as a modern dialect of Sesotho named &quot;Serotse&quot; or &quot;Sekololo&quot;.

The oral history of the Basotho and Northern Sotho peoples (as contained in their liboko) states that &#x27;Mathulare, a daughter of the chief of the &quot;Bafokeng&quot; nation (an old and respected people), was married to chief Tabane of the (Southern) &quot;Bakgatla&quot; (a branch of the &quot;Bahurutse&quot;, who are one of the most ancient of the Sotho–Tswana tribes), and bore the founders of five tribes: &quot;Bapedi&quot; (by Mopedi), &quot;Makgolokwe&quot; (by Kgetsi), &quot;Baphuthing&quot; (by Mophuthing, and later the Mzizi of Dlamini, connected with the present-day Ndebele), &quot;Batlokwa&quot; (by Kgwadi), and &quot;Basia&quot; (by Mosia). These were the first peoples to be called &quot;Basotho&quot;, before many of their descendants and other peoples came together to form Moshoeshoe I&#x27;s nation in the early 19th century. The situation is even further complicated by various historical factors, such as members of parent clans joining their descendants or various clans calling themselves by the same names (because they honour the same legendary ancestor or have the same totem).

An often repeated story is that when the modern Basotho nation was established by King Moshoeshoe I, his own &quot;dialect&quot; Sekwena was chosen over two other popular variations Setlokwa and Setaung and that these two still exist as &quot;dialects&quot; of modern Sesotho. The inclusion of Setlokwa in this scenario is confusing, as the modern language named &quot;Setlokwa&quot; is a Northern Sesotho language spoken by descendants of the same Batlokwa whose attack on the young chief Moshoeshoe&#x27;s settlement during Lifaqane (led by the famous widow Mmanthatisi) caused them to migrate to present-day Lesotho. On the other hand, Doke &amp; Mofokeng claims that the tendency of many Sesotho speakers to say for example &quot;ke ronngwe&quot; instead of &quot;ke romilwe&quot; when forming the perfect of the passive of verbs ending in &quot;-ma&quot; (as well as forming their perfects with &quot;-mme&quot; instead of &quot;-mile&quot; ) is &quot;a relic of the extinct Tlokwa dialect&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
According to the South African National Census of 2011, there were almost four million first language Sesotho speakers recorded in South Africa – approximately eight per cent of the population. Most Sesotho speakers in South Africa reside in Free State and Gauteng. Sesotho is also the main language spoken by the people of Lesotho, where, according to 1993 data, it was spoken by about 1,493,000 people, or 85% of the population. The census fails to record other South Africans for whom Sesotho is a second or third language. Such speakers are found in all major residential areas of Metropolitan Municipalities – such as Johannesburg, and the Vaal Triangle – where multilingualism and polylectalism are very high.

===Official status===
Sesotho is one of the twelve official languages of South Africa, one of the two official languages of Lesotho and one of the sixteen official languages of Zimbabwe.

==Derived languages==
Sesotho is one of the many languages from which tsotsitaals are derived. Tsotsitaal is not a proper language, as it is primarily a unique vocabulary and a set of idioms but used with the grammar and inflexion rules of another language (usually Sesotho or Zulu). It is a part of the youth culture in most Southern Gauteng townships and is the primary language used in Kwaito music.

==Phonology==

The sound system of Sesotho is unusual in many respects. It has ejective consonants, click consonants, a uvular trill, a relatively large number of affricate consonants, no prenasalised consonants, and a rare form of vowel-height (alternatively, advanced tongue root) harmony. In total, the language contains some 39 consonantal and 9 vowel phonemes.

It also has a large number of complex sound transformations which often change the phones of words due to the influence of other (sometimes invisible) sounds.

# is an allophone of , occurring only before the close vowels ( and ). Dialectical evidence shows that in the Sotho–Tswana languages was originally pronounced as a retroflex flap before the two close vowels.

Sesotho makes a three-way distinction between lightly ejective, aspirated and voiced stops in several places of articulation.

The standard Sesotho clicks tend to be substituted with dental clicks in regular speech.

==Orthography==
==Grammar==

The most striking properties of Sesotho grammar, and the most important properties which reveal it as a Bantu language, are its noun gender and concord systems. The grammatical gender system does not encode sex gender, and indeed, Bantu languages in general are not grammatically marked for gender.

Another well-known property of the Bantu languages is their agglutinative morphology. Additionally, they tend to lack any grammatical case systems, indicating noun roles almost exclusively through word order.

<text>Rivers are ordered alphabetically, by state. The same river may be found in more than one state as many rivers cross state borders.

==Longest rivers nationally==


==Longest river by state or territory==
Although the Murray River forms much of the border separating New South Wales and Victoria, it is not Victoria&#x27;s longest river because the New South Wales border is delineated by the river&#x27;s southern bank rather than by the middle of the river. The only section of the river formally within Victoria is a stretch of approximately where it separates Victoria and South Australia. At this point, the middle of the river forms the border.

==Rivers by state or territory==
The following is a list of rivers located within Australian states and territories. Where a river crosses a state or territory boundary, it is listed in both states and territories. Where a river has a name that includes the word creek, it has been officially designated as a river.

The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales lists 439 rivers in the Geographical Names Register. In the following list, where there are duplicated names, the source local government area (LGA) is identified. In the event of there being two rivers of the same name within the same local government area, additional referencing is provided. Rivers of New South Wales lists all rivers below, grouped according to whether the river flows towards the coast or flow inland, and grouped according to their respective catchment and sub-catchment. Where shown in &quot;italics&quot;, the watercourse is a creek, rivulet, brook, or similar.

<text>Walburga Stemmer (March 1892 – October 1928) was a woman who had an affair with German field marshal Erwin Rommel and gave birth to his daughter, Gertrud Stemmer (later Mrs. Gertrud Pan), on 8 December 1913. Rommel&#x27;s family put pressure on him to leave Stemmer and return to his fiancée Lucie Mollin, whom he soon married.

Stemmer died in 1928, when Rommel&#x27;s wife Lucie was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s son Manfred. Her cause of death was given as pneumonia, though it is generally accepted that she probably committed suicide.

==Life==

Stemmer was the daughter of a seamstress. She was twenty years old and working as a fruit-seller in Weingarten (Württemberg) when she met Rommel, who was assigned to the area to train army recruits. He was separated from his fiancée Lucie, who was studying in Danzig.

In 1913, a year after he met Walburga, their daughter Gertrud was born, to Rommel&#x27;s delight. He wrote to Walburga, calling her his &quot;little mouse&quot;. He said he would like to set up home with her and Gertrud: &quot;It&#x27;s got to be perfect, this little nest of ours.&quot; However this did not happen. Rommel broke off the relationship. Walburga is said to have never recovered. Rommel&#x27;s mother seems to have put pressure on him to end the relationship because she believed Walburga was not suitable to be the wife of an officer.

Despite the separation, Rommel had no intention of abandoning Walburga and Gertrud. He told Lucie the truth about the relationship, provided financial support and kept in regular contact. When World War I began only a few months after Gertrud&#x27;s birth, Rommel arranged that in the event he was killed his life insurance would support Gertrud.

In 1916, Rommel married Lucie. Walburga continued to hope that he would return to them. She hoped that as long as the couple remained childless Rommel&#x27;s devotion to Gertrud would bring him back to her. According to Gertrud&#x27;s son Josef Pan, &quot;Rommel was Walburga&#x27;s only love. As long as Rommel and Lucie never had children she held on to the conviction that he would return to her. When Manfred was born in 1928 she took an overdose... The explanation given in public was that she had died of pneumonia. Later the family doctor told my mother she had taken her own life.&quot;

==Gertrud and Rommel== 

After her mother&#x27;s death, Rommel and Lucie helped to look after the fifteen-year-old Gertrud. Gertrud exchanged hundreds of letters with her father. She knitted him a plaid scarf, which is seen in many images of Rommel in the desert. Lucie knew that Gertrud was Rommel&#x27;s daughter and the family helped support her. Manfred Rommel noted she was always referred to as &quot;cousin Gertrud&quot;.

Gertrud was a frequent visitor to the family and was at Rommel&#x27;s hospital bedside after he returned ill from Africa. There, she answered the telephone call from a furious Hitler who ordered him back to Africa. She stayed close to the family even after Rommel&#x27;s forced suicide, and his letters to and from Walburga and Gertrud were inherited by her son Joseph, who made the story public in 2000 after Gertrud&#x27;s death.

<text>A learning curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between how proficient people are at a task and the amount of experience they have. Proficiency (measured on the vertical axis) usually increases with increased experience (the horizontal axis), that is to say, the more someone, groups, companies or industries perform a task, the better their performance at the task.

The common expression &quot;a steep learning curve&quot; is a misnomer suggesting that an activity is difficult to learn and that expending much effort does not increase proficiency by much, although a learning curve with a steep start actually represents rapid progress. In fact, the gradient of the curve has nothing to do with the overall difficulty of an activity, but expresses the expected rate of change of learning speed over time. An activity that it is easy to learn the basics of, but difficult to gain proficiency in, may be described as having &quot;a steep learning curve&quot;.

The learning curve may refer to a specific task or a body of knowledge. Hermann Ebbinghaus first described the learning curve in 1885 in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name did not come into use until 1903. In 1936 Theodore Paul Wright described the effect of learning on production costs in the aircraft industry. This form, in which &quot;unit cost&quot; is plotted against &quot;total production&quot;, is sometimes called an experience curve, or Wright&#x27;s law.

==In psychology==
Hermann Ebbinghaus&#x27; memory tests, published in 1885, involved memorizing series of nonsense syllables, and recording the success over a number of trials. The translation does not use the term &#x27;learning curve&#x27; — but he presents diagrams of learning against trial number. He also notes that the score can decrease, or even oscillate.

The first known use of the term &#x27;learning curve&#x27; is from 1903: &quot;Bryan and Harter (6) found in their study of the acquisition of the telegraphic language a learning curve which had the rapid rise at the beginning followed by a period of slower learning, and was thus convex to the vertical axis.&quot;

Psychologist Arthur Bills gave a more detailed description of learning curves in 1934. He also discussed the properties of different types of learning curves, such as negative acceleration, positive acceleration, plateaus, and ogive curves.

==In economics==

=== History ===

In 1936, Theodore Paul Wright described the effect of learning on production costs in the aircraft industry and proposed a mathematical model of the learning curve.

In 1952, the US Air Force published data on the learning curve in the airframe industry from 1940 to mid-1945. Specifically, they tabulated and plotted the direct man-hour cost of various products as a function of cumulative production. This formed the basis of many studies on learning curves in the 1950s.

In 1968 Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) generalized the Unit Cost model pioneered by Wright, and specifically used a Power Law, which is sometimes called &quot;Henderson&#x27;s Law&quot;. He named this particular version the experience curve.
Research by BCG in the 1970s observed experience curve effects for various industries that ranged from 10 to 25 percent.

=== Models ===

The main statistical models for learning curves are as follows:

* Wright&#x27;s model (&quot;log-linear&quot;): formula_1, where 
** formula_2 is the cost of the formula_3-th unit, 
** formula_3 is the total number of units made,
** formula_5 is the cost of the first unit made,
** formula_6 is the exponent measuring the strength of learning. 
* Plateau model: formula_7, where formula_8 models the minimal cost achievable. In other words, the learning ceases after cost reaches a sufficiently low level.
* Stanford-B model: formula_9, where formula_10 models worker&#x27;s prior experience.
* DeJong&#x27;s model: formula_11, where formula_12 models the fraction of production done by machines (assumed to be unable to learn, unlike a human worker).
* S-curve model: formula_13, a combination of Stanford-B model and DeJong&#x27;s model.

The key variable is the exponent formula_6 measuring the strength of learning. It is usually expressed as formula_15, where formula_16 is the &quot;learning rate&quot;. In words, it means that the unit cost decreases by formula_17, for every doubling of total units made. Wright found that formula_18 in aircraft manufacturing, meaning that the unit cost decreases by 20% for every doubling of total units made.

=== Applications ===
The economic learning of productivity and efficiency generally follows the same kinds of experience curves and have interesting secondary effects. Efficiency and productivity improvement can be considered as whole organization or industry or economy learning processes, as well as for individuals. The general pattern is of first speeding up and then slowing down, as the practically achievable level of methodology improvement is reached. The effect of reducing local effort and resource use by learning improved methods often has the opposite latent effect on the next larger scale system, by facilitating its expansion, or economic growth, as discussed in the Jevons paradox in the 1880s and updated in the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate in the 1980s.

A comprehensive understanding of the application of learning curve on managerial economics would provide plenty of benefits on strategic level. People could predict the appropriate timing of the introductions for new products and offering competitive pricing decisions, deciding investment levels by stimulate innovations on products and the selection of organizational design structures.
Balachander and Srinivasan used to study a durable product and its pricing strategy on the principles of the learning curve. Based on the concepts that the growing experience in producing and selling a product would cause the decline of unit production cost, they found the potential best introductory price for this product. As for the problems of production management under the limitation of scarce resources, Liao observed that without including the effects of the learning curve on labor hours and machines hours, people might make incorrect managerial decisions. Demeester and Qi used the learning curve to study the transition between the old products&#x27; eliminating and new products&#x27; introduction. Their results indicated that the optimal switching time is determined by the characteristics of product and process, market factors, and the features of learning curve on this production. Konstantaras, Skouri, and Jaber applied the learning curve on demand forecasting and the economic order quantity. They found that the buyers obey to a learning curve, and this result is useful for decision-making on inventory management.

Learning curves have been used to model Moore&#x27;s law in the semiconductor industry.

When wages are proportional to number of products made, workers may resist changing to a different post or having a new member on the team, since it would temporarily decrease productivity. Learning curves has been used to adjust for temporary dips so that workers are paid more for the same product while they are learning.

== Examples and mathematical modeling ==
A learning curve is a plot of proxy measures for implied learning (proficiency or progression toward a limit) with experience.
* The horizontal axis represents experience either directly as time (clock time, or the time spent on the activity), or can be related to time (a number of trials, or the total number of units produced).
* The vertical axis is a measure representing &#x27;learning&#x27; or &#x27;proficiency&#x27; or other proxy for &quot;efficiency&quot; or &quot;productivity&quot;. It can either be increasing (for example, the score in a test), or decreasing (the time to complete a test).

For the performance of one person in a series of trials the curve can be erratic, with proficiency increasing, decreasing or leveling out in a plateau.

When the results of a large number of individual trials are averaged then a smooth curve results, which can often be described with a mathematical function. 

Several main functions have been used:

* The S-Curve or Sigmoid function is the idealized general form of all learning curves, with slowly accumulating small steps at first followed by larger steps and then successively smaller ones later, as the learning activity reaches its limit. That idealizes the normal progression from discovery of something to learn about followed to the limit of learning about it. The other shapes of learning curves (4, 5 &amp; 6) show segments of S-curves without their full extents. In this case the improvement of proficiency starts slowly, then increases rapidly, and finally levels off.
* Exponential growth; the proficiency can increase without limit, as in Exponential growth
* Exponential rise or fall to a Limit; proficiency can exponentially approach a limit in a manner similar to that in which a capacitor charges or discharges (exponential decay) through a resistor. The increase in skill or retention of information may increase rapidly to its maximum rate during the initial attempts, and then gradually levels out, meaning that the subject&#x27;s skill does not improve much with each later repetition, with less new knowledge gained over time.
* Power law; similar in appearance to an exponential decay function, and is almost always used for a decreasing performance metric, such as cost. It also has the property that if plotted as the logarithm of proficiency against the logarithm of experience the result is a straight line, and it is often presented that way.

The specific case of a plot of Unit Cost versus Total Production with a power law was named the experience curve: the mathematical function is sometimes called Henderson&#x27;s Law. This form of learning curve is used extensively in industry for cost projections.

==In machine learning==

Plots relating performance to experience are widely used in machine learning. Performance is the error rate or accuracy of the learning system, while experience may be the number of training examples used for learning or the number of iterations used in optimizing the system model parameters. The machine learning curve is useful for many purposes including comparing different algorithms, choosing model parameters during design, adjusting optimization to improve convergence, and determining the amount of data used for training.

==Broader interpretations==
Initially introduced in educational and behavioral psychology, the term has acquired a broader interpretation over time, and expressions such as &quot;experience curve&quot;, &quot;improvement curve&quot;, &quot;cost improvement curve&quot;, &quot;progress curve&quot;, &quot;progress function&quot;, &quot;startup curve&quot;, and &quot;efficiency curve&quot; are often used interchangeably. In economics the subject is rates of &quot;development&quot;, as development refers to a whole system learning process with varying rates of progression. Generally speaking all learning displays incremental change over time, but describes an &quot;S&quot; curve which has different appearances depending on the time scale of observation. It has now also become associated with the evolutionary theory of punctuated equilibrium and other kinds of revolutionary change in complex systems generally, relating to innovation, organizational behavior and the management of group learning, among other fields. These processes of rapidly emerging new form appear to take place by complex learning within the systems themselves, which when observable, display curves of changing rates that accelerate and decelerate.

==General learning limits==
&quot;Learning curves&quot;, also called &quot;experience curves&quot;, relate to the much broader subject of natural limits for resources and technologies in general. Such limits generally present themselves as increasing complications that slow the learning of how to do things more efficiently, like the well-known limits of perfecting any process or product or to perfecting measurements. These practical experiences match the predictions of the second law of thermodynamics for the limits of waste reduction generally. Approaching limits of perfecting things to eliminate waste meets geometrically increasing effort to make progress, and provides an environmental measure of all factors seen and unseen changing the learning experience. Perfecting things becomes ever more difficult despite increasing effort despite continuing positive, if ever diminishing, results. The same kind of slowing progress due to complications in learning also appears in the limits of useful technologies and of profitable markets applying to product life cycle management and software development cycles). Remaining market segments or remaining potential efficiencies or efficiencies are found in successively less convenient forms.

Efficiency and development curves typically follow a two-phase process of first bigger steps corresponding to finding things easier, followed by smaller steps of finding things more difficult. It reflects bursts of learning following breakthroughs that make learning easier followed by meeting constraints that make learning ever harder, perhaps toward a point of cessation.

* Natural Limits One of the key studies in the area concerns diminishing returns on investments generally, either physical or financial, pointing to whole system limits for resource development or other efforts. The most studied of these may be Energy Return on Energy Invested or EROEI, discussed at length in an Encyclopedia of the Earth article and in an OilDrum article and series also referred to as Hubert curves. The energy needed to produce energy is a measure of our difficulty in learning how to make remaining energy resources useful in relation to the effort expended. Energy returns on energy invested have been in continual decline for some time, caused by natural resource limits and increasing investment. Energy is both nature&#x27;s and our own principal resource for making things happen. The point of diminishing returns is when increasing investment makes the resource more expensive. As natural limits are approached, easily used sources are exhausted and ones with more complications need to be used instead. As an environmental signal persistently diminishing EROI indicates an approach of whole system limits in our ability to make things happen.
* Useful Natural Limits EROEI measures the return on invested effort as a ratio of R/I or &quot;learning progress&quot;. The inverse I/R measures &quot;learning difficulty&quot;. The simple difference is that if R approaches zero R/I will too, but I/R will approach infinity. When complications emerge to limit learning progress the limit of &quot;useful returns&quot;, uR, is approached and R-uR approaches zero. The &quot;difficulty of useful learning&quot; I/(R-uR) approaches infinity as increasingly difficult tasks make the effort unproductive. That point is approached as a vertical asymptote, at a particular point in time, that can be delayed only by unsustainable effort. It defines a point at which enough investment has been made and the &quot;task is done&quot;, usually planned to be the same as when the &quot;task is complete&quot;. For unplanned tasks it may be either foreseen or discovered by surprise. The usefulness measure, uR, is affected by the complexity of environmental responses that can only be measured when they occur unless they are foreseen.

== In culture ==

===&quot;Steep learning curve&quot;===
The expression &quot;steep learning curve&quot; is used with opposite meanings. Most sources, including the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;, the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, and &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, define a learning curve as the rate at which skill is acquired, so a steep increase would mean a quick increment of skill.
However, the term is often used in common English with the meaning of a difficult initial learning process.

The common English usage aligns with a metaphorical interpretation of the learning curve as a hill to climb. (A steeper hill is initially hard, while a gentle slope is less strainful, though sometimes rather tedious. Accordingly, the shape of the curve (hill) may not indicate the total amount of work required. Instead, it can be understood as a matter of preference related to ambition, personality and learning style.)
The term &quot;learning curve&quot; with meanings of &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot; can be described with adjectives like &quot;short&quot; and &quot;long&quot; rather than &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;steep&quot;. If two products have similar functionality then the one with a &quot;steep&quot; curve is probably better, because it can be learned in a shorter time. On the other hand, if two products have different functionality, then one with a &quot;short&quot; curve (a short time to learn) and limited functionality may not be as good as one with a &quot;long&quot; curve (a long time to learn) and greater functionality.

For example, the Windows program Notepad is extremely simple to learn, but offers little after this. At the other extreme is the UNIX terminal editor vi or Vim, which is difficult to learn, but offers a wide array of features after the user has learned how to use it.

=== &quot;On a steep learning curve&quot; ===
Ben Zimmer discusses the use of the term &quot;on a steep learning curve&quot; in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, a television series set in the early 20th century, concentrating mainly on whether use of the term is an anachronism. &quot;Matthew Crawley, the presumptive heir of Downton Abbey and now the co-owner of the estate, says, &#x27;I&#x27;ve been on a steep learning curve since arriving at Downton.&#x27; By this he means that he has had a difficult time learning the ways of Downton, but people did not start talking that way until the 1970s.&quot;

Zimmer also comments that the popular use of &quot;steep&quot; as &quot;difficult&quot; is a reversal of the technical meaning. He identifies the first use of &quot;steep learning curve&quot; as 1973, and the &quot;arduous&quot; interpretation as 1978.

=== Difficulty curves in video games ===

The idea of learning curves is often translated into video game gameplay as a &quot;difficulty curve&quot;, which described how hard the game may get as the player progresses through the game and requiring the player to either become more proficient with the game, gain better understanding of the game&#x27;s mechanics, and/or spend time &quot;grinding&quot; to improve their characters. Establishing the right difficulty curve is part of achieving the game balance within a title. As with learning curves in educational settings, difficulty curves can have multitudes of shapes, and games may frequently provide various levels of difficulty that change the shape of this curve relative to its default to make the game harder or easier. Optimally the difficulty of a video game increases in correspondence with players ability. Games must neither be too challenging nor too undemanding nor too fortuitous. The players will continue playing as long as a game is perceived to be winnable. This is therefore referred to as the &quot;illusion of winnability&quot;. To generate an illusion of winnability games can include, internal value (a sense of moving towards a goal and being rewarded for it) driven by conflict which can be generated by an antagonistic environment and story driven suspense in the form of world building. The latter is not pivotal to progressing in a game. Game designers may also make changes in gameplay by, for instance, limiting resources. One perspective is that if players are not tricked to believe that the video game world is real - if the world does not feel vibrant - then there is no point in creating the game.

<text>The Mono–Inyo Craters are a volcanic chain of craters, domes and lava flows in Mono County, Eastern California. The chain stretches from the northwest shore of Mono Lake to the south of Mammoth Mountain. The Mono Lake Volcanic Field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore. Most of the Mono Craters, which make up the bulk of the northern part of the Mono–Inyo chain, are phreatic (steam explosion) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over-topped by rhyolite domes and lava flows. The Inyo volcanic chain form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits, and rhyolitic lava flows and domes. The southernmost part of the chain consists of fumaroles and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and a set of cinder cones south of the mountain; the latter are called the Red Cones.

Eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo volcanic chain. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber like the one that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.

The region has been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was collected by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and a large part of the Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.

==Geography and description==

===Setting===
The Mono–Inyo Craters form a volcanic chain in Eastern California that sits along a narrow north–south-trending fissure system extending from the north shore of Mono Lake through the western Long Valley Caldera, south of Mammoth Mountain. The chain is within the Inyo National Forest and Mono County; the nearest incorporated community is Mammoth Lakes. The craters are in the Great Basin geographic area.

====Mono Craters====
The Mono Craters are a chain of at least 27 volcanic domes, three large glass flows called coulees and various explosion pits and other associated volcanic features. The domes of the chain lie on a roughly north–south-trending arc that is concave to the west and located south of Mono Lake. The highest of the Mono Craters domes is Crater Mountain (elevation 9,172 feet or 2,796 m), which rises above Pumice Valley to the west. Associated volcanic features are located in Mono Lake (Paoha and Negit Islands) and on its north shore (Black Point). The coulees cluster north and south of the overlapping chain of domes.

====Inyo volcanic chain====
The Inyo volcanic chain stretches from Wilson Butte to the Inyo Craters, proper. The Inyo Craters are open pits in a forested area that are about across and deep, each with small ponds covering their floors. A quarter mile (half kilometer) north of these is another explosion pit on top of Deer Mountain. Farther north of these craters are five lava domes, including Deadman Creek Dome, Glass Creek Dome, Obsidian Dome, and Wilson Butte. These domes are composed of gray rhyolite, frothy pumice, and black obsidian. The Inyo volcanic chain extends into Long Valley Caldera but is not related to the caldera&#x27;s volcanism.

====Red Cones====
South of the Inyo volcanic chain are other features related to the dike system responsible for creating the craters, volcanoes and lava flows. These include a north–south trend of fault scarps up to high and pull-apart cracks or fissures in the earth. These fissures are not technically faults because little or no vertical or horizontal movement has occurred along them. Most notable among these is &quot;Earthquake Fault&quot;, a fissure up to wide that cuts into glassy rhyolite lava flows. The fissure was formed by stretching induced by the intrusion of the Inyo dike. Stairs to the bottom of the fissure were removed after being damaged by earthquakes in 1980.
Several Mono–Inyo-related explosion pits are on Mammoth Mountain. The Red Cones, south of Mammoth Mountain, are basaltic cinder cones and are the southernmost part of the Mono–Inyo Craters volcanic chain.

===Climate and ecology===
The Mono–Inyo Craters are in the Central Basin and Range ecoregion of the North American Desert. The desert environment of Mono Basin receives about of precipitation a year. Annual precipitation around Mammoth Lakes, which is close to the Inyo volcanic chain, is about . Moisture travels over the Sierra crest from the Pacific Ocean through the San Joaquin Gap. Temperatures in Mono Basin range from average winter lows of to average summer highs of . Temperatures near the Inyo volcanic chain and Mammoth Lakes area range from winter average lows of to summer average highs of .

Most of the surface of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, directly to the west, is covered by sagebrush scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo volcanic chain and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.

===Typical evolution===

Panum Crater is the northernmost volcano in the sequence and is a good example of both a tuff ring and a rhyolite dome. Its structure is twofold; an outer tuff ring (forming a classic crater) and an inner plug, or dome of rhyolite, pumice and obsidian created from lavas. In this case, heat from the magma feeding Panum flashed groundwater to steam to create the tuff ring before lava reached the surface. Other Mono Craters also were formed in this manner, but their plug domes grew larger than their tuff ring craters. The domes have steep sides and are flanked by slopes of scree consisting of large angular and glass-rich rocks. Devil&#x27;s Punch Bowl, located south of the main dome complex, stopped forming at an earlier stage of development. It is a wide and deep explosion pit with a much smaller glass dome on its floor.

The large North and South Coulee and the smaller Northwest Coulee consist of obsidian-rich rhyolite. They were formed from slow-moving lava that had a thin and brittle crust. Once the flow stopped, it formed steep sided tongues of sharp and angular rock that are typically thick and have scree piles along their base. South Coulee is long, wide and has a volume of ; making it the largest Mono Craters coulee in volume. South Coulee originates from the crest of the Mono Domes, about from the southern end, flows down its east and west flanks and terminates at its foot. North Coulee is nearly as large, flows mostly to the east and terminates in a divided pair of lobes. Northwest Coulee is located northwest of North Coulee and was intruded by Upper Dome after the coulee solidified. Permanent pockets of ice from snowmelt have been found inside the coulees and domes.
==Geology==

===Background===

The Mono–Inyo chain of craters lies in east-central California, roughly parallel to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California are a result of two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.
Basement rock under the Mono–Inyo chain consists of the same granitic and metamorphic rock that make up the Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far back as 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.

Volcanoes erupted from 3.6 to 2.3 million years ago near what is now Long Valley. Rhyolitic eruptions occurred in and around Glass Mountain in the same area from 2.1 to 0.8 million years ago. Volcanic ash from the massive ( of ejecta) eruption of Long Valley Caldera some 760,000 years ago is preserved in the thick Bishop Tuff that covers much of the region.

Eruptions of basalt and andesite 400,000 to 60,000 years ago in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera were the first activity associated with the Mono–Inyo Craters system. Eruptions around 300,000 years ago filled the west moat with of basaltic lava. Basaltic and andesitic eruptive activity then moved to Mono Basin and lasted from 40,000 to 13,000 years ago.

Seismic data indicate that a magma chamber with an estimated volume of exists directly below the Mono Craters. About of subsidence has occurred within a ring fracture system centered on Pumice Valley west of the chamber in the last 700,000 years. The Mono Craters sit atop a -long arc on the eastern side of the -wide ring-fracture system. Magma feeding the domes may have exploited arc-shaped fissures around an intrusion of granitic rock deep below the chain. This magma chamber is separate from the magma chamber under Long Valley Caldera. The recent eruptions of the Mono Craters have been similar in volume and nearly identical in composition (&quot;crystal-poor high-silica rhyolite&quot;) to those of Glass Mountain that preceded the Long Valley Caldera-forming eruption. It has been suggested that the Mono Craters volcanism may represent an early stage in the development of a future caldera.

Repeated eruption of dacite and rhyodacite from vents on the southwest rim of the caldera from 220,000 to 50,000 years ago formed Mammoth Mountain, a volcano composed of overlapping lava domes. Eruptions of dacite and rhyodacite occurred in Mono Basin from 100,000 to 6,000 years ago.
===Mono Craters, Negit Island and Black Point===

Multiple eruptions of silica-rich rhyolite from 40,000 to 600 years ago built the Mono Craters. Black Point, today on the north shore of Mono Lake, is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed under the surface of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island. The magma reservoir feeding the Mono Lake Volcanic Field is unrelated to the Mono Craters magma reservoir.

Basaltic andesite lava built the Red Cones, two small cinder cones southwest of Mammoth Lakes, around 8,500 before present. The five Mammoth Mountain Craters are a set of explosion pits that trend west-north-west for near the northern flank of Mammoth Mountain.

None of the Mono Craters near the lake show the effects of wave erosion, but a hill at the southern end of the field shows what Israel Russell called a &quot;beach line&quot;. The present elevation of this beach line is the level of the Mono Lake high stand before the formation of the northern Mono Craters, plus any surface deformation that has happened since that time. Stream-rounded stones are found on the volcanoes, and were lifted up as the volcanoes grew. Although glaciers were present throughout the Sierra Nevada, they did not reach as far down as the Mono Craters.

The most recent eruptive episode on the Mono Craters occurred sometime between the years 1325 and 1365. A vertical sheet-like mass of magma, called a dike, caused groundwater to explosively flash to steam, creating a line of vents long. A mix of ash and pulverized rock, called tephra, covered about of the Mono Lake region. The tephra were carried by the wind and deposited in a layer deep from the vents and deep away.

Pyroclastic flows of hot clouds of gas, ash and pulverized lava erupted from these vents in narrow tongues that extended up to away and covered . Rhyolite lava oozed out of the vents to form several steep-sided domes, including Panum Dome and the much larger North Coulee flow. The youngest domes and coulees are 600 to 700 years old and are, therefore, the youngest mountains in North America.

===Inyo volcanic chain and Paoha Island===
The Inyo volcanic chain formed approximately 600 years ago.
This activity occurred just a few years after the Mono Crater eruptions, and was caused by a dike of similar composition. The dike eventually became long and up to wide. The ground above the dike was significantly cracked and faulted.
Explosive eruptions emanated from three separate vents in the summer of 1350 CE. Pieces of molten and solid rock were ejected, small craters were formed, and an eruption column rose above the vents. Pumice and ash covered an extensive area downwind, and about of tephra was deposited where the town of Mammoth Lakes, California, now sits. A pyroclastic flow from South Deadman vent traveled about .

Some of the open pits were filled with thick and slow-moving lava to form the South Deadman Creek, Glass Creek and Obsidian Flow domes. Others, such as the Inyo Crater Lakes near Deer Mountain, remained open and were later partially filled with water. Smaller explosion pits on the north side of Mammoth Mountain were also formed at this time. In the past 6,000 years, approximately of magma has been erupted from the Inyo part of the chain.

The last recorded volcanic activity in the chain was at Mono Lake between the years 1720 and 1850. An intrusion of magma below the lake pushed lakebed sediments upward to form Paoha Island. Exposed rhyolite is on the north part of the island, and a group of seven dacite cinder cones and a lava flow are on the northeastern corner. Steam rose in columns hundreds of feet high (tens of meters) from Hot Spring Cove on the island and the spring water was when geologist Israel Russell visited the island in the early 1880s.

==History==

===Human use===
People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites.
Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Timberland to the east of the Mono Craters was clearcut for wood.

As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system.

===Early impressions===
The chain of craters has been the subject of several writers and naturalists. Mark Twain visited Mono Basin in the 1860s and wrote about Mono Lake, but did not mention any of the Mono–Inyo Craters except for the lake&#x27;s two volcanic islands. He wrote in &quot;Roughing It&quot; (1872) that the lake was in a &quot;lifeless, hideous desert ...&quot; that was the &quot;loneliest spot on earth ... little graced with the picturesque.&quot;
Naturalist John Muir explored the area in 1869. He described the &quot;Mono Desert&quot; as a &quot;... country of wonderful contrasts. Hot deserts bounded by snow-laden mountains,—cinders and ashes scattered on glacier-polished pavements,—frost and fire working together in the making of beauty. In the lake are several volcanic islands, which show that the waters were once mingled with fire.&quot; Muir described the Mono Craters as &quot;... heaps of loose ashes that have never been blest by either rain or snow ...&quot;

In the spring of 1881 and the fall of 1882, geologist Israel Russell studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of Lake Lahontan, a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period. His &quot;Quaternary History of the Mono Valley&quot; (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features.

Russell named the Mono Craters and wrote: &quot;The attention of every one who enters Mono Valley is at once attracted by the soft, pleasing colors of these craters as well as by the symmetry and beauty of their forms. They are exceptional features in the scenery of the region, and are rendered all the more striking by their proximity to the angular peaks and rugged outlines of the High Sierra.&quot;

===Protection===
The Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area, created in 1984, was the first National Scenic Area in the United States. It offers more protection than other United States Forest Service lands, surrounds Mono Lake and its two volcanic islands, Black Point, Panum Crater and much of the northern half of the Mono Craters. Litigation and outreach by the Mono Lake Committee, the National Audubon Society and other conservation groups has helped to slow water diversions from tributaries feeding Mono Lake.

==Volcanic hazards==

The Long Valley to Mono Lake region is one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey&#x27;s volcanic hazards program. These areas are in the program because they have been active in the last 2,000 years and have the ability to produce explosive eruptions.

About 20 eruptions have occurred on the Mono–Inyo Craters chain at intervals of 250 to 700 years during the past 5,000 years. Seismic soundings and lava composition indicate that these eruptions most likely originated from discrete and small magma bodies. The rate of eruption over the last 1,000 years has increased, with at least 12 eruptions occurring.

All eruptions in the past 5,000 years from the Mono–Inyo Craters have expelled less than of magma. Future eruptions in the area will likely be similar in size to the small to moderate events of the past 5,000 years. There is a one in 200 chance (0.5%) per year of an eruption occurring along the chain. An eruption in the foreseeable future is probably more likely along the Mono–Inyo chain than an unrelated eruption inside Long Valley Caldera.

===Effects===

A wide range of effects are expected from future eruptions along the Mono–Inyo Craters. Ash and rock fragments (tephra) may accumulate to a thickness of near an erupting Mono–Inyo vent. Downwind accumulations of tephra may exceed at a distance of and at . Winds in the area tend to blow toward an east or northeasterly direction more than 50 percent of the time, and toward any easterly direction more than 80 percent of the time. Grain size and thickness of tephra generally decreases gradually with distance from a vent. Volcanic ash will likely contaminate air routes east of the vent.

Severe damage from super-heated flows of gas, ash and pulverized rock (pyroclastic flows and surges) may occur at least from an explosive eruption. The amount of damage depends on vent location, topography, and volume of magma erupted. Pyroclastic flows from vents on Mammoth Mountain or other high vent could travel farther by gaining extra momentum from their descent. Valleys along the route will be more impacted than ridges but flows and surges could overtop some ridges. Eruptions near snowpacks may produce lahars of mud and ash that devastate valleys and watersheds. Steam blast eruptions under a lake could form large waves capable of flooding nearby areas and starting mudflows.

Basalt lava flows may extend more than from their vent. Dacite and rhyolite lavas produce short, thick flows that rarely extend more than from their vent. Mound-shaped features called lava domes are often created from these flows. Rock fragments thrown from a growing lava dome may reach from the dome. A partial collapse of the steep-sided growing dome can send pyroclastic flows outward at least . Taller domes tend to form larger pyroclastic flows that travel farther.

==Activities==

Many recreational activities are available along the chain. The Mono Basin National Scenic Area visitor center is located near Mono Lake just off U.S. Route 395. A bookstore, an information desk staffed by USDA Forest Service Rangers, and museum exhibits help to orient visitors. The Mono Lake Committee has a staffed office and visitor information center in Lee Vining on the corner of U.S. Route 395 and 3rd Street. Information on camping, hiking, guided and self-guided tours can all be obtained at either location.

Multiple paved roads surround the Mono-Inyo craters. U.S. 395 is a scenic route that roughly parallels the Mono–Inyo Craters volcanic chain. California State Route 120 approaches the northern and eastern parts of the Mono Domes, including Panum Crater. Mammoth Scenic Loop approaches the Inyo Craters. Direct access to the Mono—Inyo Craters requires driving on unpaved roads, then walking.

The town of Mammoth Lakes and Mammoth Mountain are located near the southern end of the chain. Mammoth Mountain Ski Area is located nearby and gondola rides can be taken year-round (weather permitting) to the mountain&#x27;s summit. The summit of Mammoth Mountain provides panoramic views of the craters and domes of the Mono–Inyo volcanic chain, Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada and Long Valley Caldera.

Mono Lake itself has its own set of activities, including walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours of the lake, and birdwatching opportunities. The lake is too salty to support any fish, but fishing is possible in streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.

<text>Deep time is a term introduced and applied by John McPhee to the concept of geologic time in his book &quot;Basin and Range&quot; (1981), parts of which originally appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.
The philosophical concept of geological time was developed in the 18th century by Scottish geologist James Hutton; his &quot;system of the habitable Earth&quot; was a deistic mechanism keeping the world eternally suitable for humans. The modern concept entails huge changes over the age of the Earth which has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55 billion years.

== Concept ==

James Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward. As mathematician John Playfair, one of Hutton&#x27;s friends and colleagues in the Scottish Enlightenment, remarked upon seeing the strata of the angular unconformity at Siccar Point with Hutton and James Hall in June 1788, &quot;the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time&quot;.

Early geologists such as Nicolas Steno and Horace Bénédict de Saussure had developed ideas of geological strata forming from water through chemical processes, which Abraham Gottlob Werner developed into a theory known as Neptunism, envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form rock. Hutton&#x27;s innovative 1785 theory, based on Plutonism, visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote &quot;we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end&quot;.

Other scientists such as Georges Cuvier put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as Adam Sedgwick incorporated Werner&#x27;s ideas into concepts of catastrophism; Sedgwick inspired his university student Charles Darwin to exclaim &quot;What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!&quot;. In a competing theory, Charles Lyell in his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; (1830–1833) developed Hutton&#x27;s comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial scientific concept into uniformitarianism. As a young naturalist and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell&#x27;s book exhaustively during the &quot;Beagle&quot; survey voyage in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about evolution.

Physicist Gregory Benford addresses the concept in &quot;Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia&quot; (1999), as does paleontologist and &quot;Nature&quot; editor Henry Gee in &quot;In Search of Deep Time: Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life&quot; (2001) Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow, Time&#x27;s Cycle&quot; (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

In &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow, Time&#x27;s Cycle&quot;, Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:
Consider the Earth&#x27;s history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King&#x27;s nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the Persian geologist and polymath Avicenna, and by the Chinese naturalist and polymath Shen Kuo. The Roman Catholic theologian Thomas Berry explored spiritual implications of the concept of deep time. Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of deep ecology and ecophilosophy. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of Joanna Macy.

H. G. Wells and Julian Huxley regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&quot;The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice,&quot; they said in &quot;The Science of Life&quot; (1929). &quot;We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size ... to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit.&quot;

<text>Giric mac Dúngail (Modern Gaelic: &quot;Griogair mac Dhunghail&quot;; fl. c. 878–889), in modern English his name is Gregory or Greg MacDougal and nicknamed Mac Rath (&quot;Son of Fortune&quot;), was a king of the Picts or the king of Alba. The Irish annals record nothing of Giric&#x27;s reign, nor do Anglo-Saxon writings add anything, and the meagre information which survives is contradictory. Modern historians disagree as to whether Giric was the sole king or ruled jointly with Eochaid, on his ancestry, and if he should be considered a Pictish king or the first king of Alba.

Although little is now known of Giric, he appears to have been regarded as an important figure in Scotland in the High Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages. Scots chroniclers such as John of Fordun, Andrew of Wyntoun, Hector Boece and the humanist scholar George Buchanan wrote of Giric as &quot;King Gregory the Great&quot; and told how he had conquered half of England and Ireland too.

The &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot; and some versions of the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; say that Giric died at Dundurn in Strathearn.

== Giric&#x27;s name ==
Giric&#x27;s name is associated with that of St Cyricus, who, as a small child, was martyred along with his mother during the Diocletianic persecution in the early fourth century. According to the &quot;Chronicles of the Kings of Scotland&quot;, St Cyricus was Giric&#x27;s patron saint, not only because his name is homophonous with the Latin form of the saint&#x27;s name, Ciricum, but also because the first church dedicated to St Cyricus was established during Giric&#x27;s reign at a place called Ecclesgreig (now St Cyrus) in Aberdeenshire. The feast day of saint is 16 June, and on (or near) that day in 885 there was a solar eclipse, which has become associated with the kingship of Giric and Eochaid, inasmuch as not long after the occasion of the eclipse, the two &quot;were expelled from the kingdom.&quot;

== Relationship between Giric and Eochaid ==
Various theories have been put forward regarding the relationship between Eochaid and Giric, who by all accounts was the elder of the two. &quot;The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;, which was written in Latin, used the phrase &quot;alumnus ordinatorque&quot; to describe relationship of Giric to Eochaid. Translator T. H. Weeks chose to translate that phrase into English as &quot;teacher and prime minister&quot;, yet in the same section offered &quot;foster-son&quot; for &quot;alumnus&quot;, translating &quot;Eochodius, cum alum(p)no suo, expulsus est nunc de regno&quot; as &quot;Eochaid with his &quot;foster-son&quot; was then thrown out of the kingdom&quot;.

There is a tendency in popular history books and web sites to refer to the two as &quot;cousins&quot; or &quot;first cousins once removed&quot;.

However, this cousin kinship is only speculation since the ancestry of Giric is obscure. Rhun, the father of Eochaid, is known to have been &quot;a king of the Britons&quot;, but little is known of Dungal, the father of Giric, which may be the reason for the speculation that he (Dungal) did not have a royal lineage. Perhaps a writer for the popular web site &quot;Undiscovered Scotland&quot; found the best solution, referring to Giric as Eochaid&#x27;s &quot;rather shadowy kinsman&quot;.

Two scholars have defined the two in political rather than kinship terms. A. Weeks, commentator, speculated, &quot;Possibly Giric was not of royal blood, so he used Eochaid as a puppet&quot;. In 1904, Sir John Rhys, professor at University of Oxford, reached a similar conclusion, positing that &quot;the real relation in which Girg probably stood to Eochaid was that of a non Celtic king of Pictish descent wielding the power of the Pictish nation with Eochaid ruling among the Brythons of Fortrenn more or less subject to him&quot;. What is known of the two is that in 878 Giric killed Aed (uncle of Eochaid) &quot;in battle&quot; in the town of Nrurim, which was probably north of Stirling. Then Giric and Eochaid, whatever their relationship, ruled jointly for eleven years.

== Son of Fortune ==
&quot;The Prophecy of Berchán&quot;, an 11th century verse history of Scots and Irish kings presented as a prophecy, is a notably difficult source. As the Prophecy refers to kings by epithets, but never by name, linking it to other materials is not straightforward. The Prophecy is believed to refer to Giric by the epithet &quot;Mac Rath&quot;, &quot;the Son of Fortune&quot;.

The entry on Giric in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; is perhaps corrupt. It states:

And Eochaid, son of Run, the king of the Britons [of Strathclyde, and] grandson of Kenneth by his daughter reigned for eleven years; although other say that Giric, the son of another, reigned at this time because he became Eochaid&#x27;s foster-father and guardian.And in [Eochaid&#x27;s] second year, Áed, Niall&#x27;s son, died; and his ninth year, on the very day of [St] Cyricus, an eclipse of the sun occurred. Eochaid with his foster-father was now expelled from the kingdom.

Kenneth is Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín); Áed, Niall&#x27;s son is Áed Findliath, who died on 20 November 879; and St Cyrus&#x27;s day was 16 June, on which day a solar eclipse occurred in 885.

== Gregory the Great ==
By the 12th century, Giric had acquired legendary status as liberator of the Scottish church from Pictish oppression and, fantastically, as conqueror of Ireland and most of England. As a result, Giric was known as Gregory the Great. This tale appears in the variant of the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; which is interpolated in Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s &quot;Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland&quot;. Here Giric, or Grig, is named &quot;Makdougall&quot;, son of Dúngal.

List &quot;D&quot;, which may be taken as typical, contains this account of Giric:

Giric, Dungal&#x27;s son, reigned for twelve years; and he died in Dundurn, and was buried in Iona. He subdued to himself all Ireland, and nearly [all] England; and he was the first to give liberty to the Scottish church, which was in servitude up to that time, after the custom and fashion of the Picts.

Giric&#x27;s conquests appear as Bernicia, rather than Ireland (Hibernia), in some versions. William Forbes Skene saw a connection between this and the account in the &quot;Historia de Sancto Cuthberto&quot; which claims that soon after the death of King Halfdan, the Northumbrians and the Northmen united under King Guthfrith to defeat a Scots invasion.

This account is not found in the Poppleton Manuscript. The lists known as &quot;D&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, and &quot;N&quot;, contain a different version, copied by the &quot;Chronicle of Melrose&quot;.

== Ut regem nostrum Girich ==
In a recent discussion of the &quot;Dunkeld Litany&quot;, which was largely fabricated in Schottenklöster in Germany in Late Medieval and Early Modern times, Thomas Owen Clancy offers the provisional conclusion that, within the emendations and additions, there lies an authentic 9th century Litany. The significance of this Litany for the question of Giric&#x27;s authenticity and kingship is contained in a prayer for the king and the army, where the king named is Giric:

Ut regem nostrum Girich cum exercito suo ab omnibus inimicorum insiidis tuearis et defendas, te rogamus audi nos.

== He shall rule over Alba as one Lord ==
Archie Duncan argues that the association of Giric and Eochaid in the kingship is spurious, that Giric alone was king of the Picts, which he claimed as the son of a daughter of Kenneth MacAlpin, and that the report that he was Eochaid&#x27;s guardian (&quot;alumpnus&quot;) is a misreading of an uncle (&quot;auunculus&quot;). A. P. Smyth proposed that Giric was a nephew of Kenneth MacAlpin, the son of his brother Donald MacAlpin (Domnall mac Ailpín), which appears to rest on what is probably a scribal error. The entry also states that an otherwise unknown Causantín, son of Domnaill (or of Dúngail) was king. Finally, Benjamin Hudson has suggested that Giric, rather than being a member of the Cenél nGabráin dynasty of Kenneth MacAlpin and his kin, was a member of the northern Cenél Loairn – descended House of Moray, and accepts the existence of Giric&#x27;s brother Causantín.

<text>Emily Greene Balch (January 8, 1867 – January 9, 1961) was an American economist, sociologist and pacifist. Balch combined an academic career at Wellesley College with a long-standing interest in social issues such as poverty, child labor, and immigration, as well as settlement work to uplift poor immigrants and reduce juvenile delinquency.

She moved into the peace movement at the start of World War I in 1914, and began collaborating with Jane Addams of Chicago. She became a central leader of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) based in Switzerland, for which she won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946.

==Early life and education==
Balch was born to a prominent Yankee family in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts (later a neighborhood of Boston), the daughter of Francis V. and Ellen (née Noyes) Balch. Her father was a successful lawyer and one time secretary to United States Senator Charles Sumner. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1889 after reading widely in the classics and languages and focusing on economics. She did graduate work in Paris and published her research as &quot;Public Assistance of the Poor in France&quot; (1893). She did settlement housework in Boston before deciding on an academic career.

She then studied at Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Berlin.

== Career ==
Balch began teaching at Wellesley College in 1896. She focused on immigration, consumption, and the economic roles of women. In 1913, she was appointed to serve as Professor of Economics at Wellesley, following the resignation of political economist Katharine Coman, who had founded the department. That same year, Balch was promoted from Associate Professor to Professor of Political Economy and of Political and Social Science.

Balch served on numerous state commissions, such as the first commission on minimum wages for women. She was a leader of the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, which supported women who belonged to labor unions. She published a major sociological study of &quot;Our Slavic Fellow Citizens&quot; in 1910.

She was a longtime pacifist, and was a participant in Henry Ford&#x27;s International Committee on Mediation, the follow-up organization to the Neutral Conference for Continuous Mediation. When the United States entered the war, she became a political activist opposing conscription in espionage legislation, and supporting the civil liberties of conscientious objectors. She collaborated with Jane Addams in the Women&#x27;s Peace Party and numerous other groups.

In a letter to the president of Wellesley, she wrote we should follow &quot;the ways of Jesus.&quot; Her spiritual thoughts were that American economy was &quot;far from being in harmony with the principles of Jesus which we profess.&quot; Wellesley College terminated her contract in 1919. Balch served as an editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, a well-known magazine of political commentary.

Balch converted from Unitarianism to Quakerism in 1921. She stated, &quot;Religion seems to me one of the most interesting things in life, one of the most puzzling, richest and thrilling fields of human thought and speculation... religious experience and thought need also a light a day and sunshine and a companionable sharing with others of which it seems to me there is generally too little... The Quaker worship at its best seems to me give opportunities for this sort of sharing without profanation.&quot;

Her major achievements were just beginning, as she became an American leader of the international peace movement. In 1919, Balch played a central role in the International Congress of Women. It changed its name to the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom and was based in Geneva.

She was hired by the League as its first international Secretary-Treasurer, administering the organization&#x27;s activities. She helped set up summer schools on peace education and created new branches in over 50 countries. She cooperated with the newly established League of Nations regarding drug control, aviation, refugees, and disarmament. In World War II, she supported the Allied powers and did not criticize the war effort, but she did support the rights of conscientious objectors.

==Nobel prize==
John Randall, professor of philosophy at Columbia University, and his wife, Mercedes Randall, one of the leaders of the US section the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, initiated a campaign to nominate Balch for the peace prize. The campaign was supported by five US organizations that established a committee called the &quot;Committee to sponsor Emily Greene Balch for the Nobel Peace Prize&quot;. The organizations were the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, the National Federation of Settlements, the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League of America, the National Council of Women of the US, and the NAACP.

Balch won the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). She donated her share of the prize money to the WILPF. Her acceptance speech highlighted the issues of nationalism and efforts for international peace.

==Personal life==
Balch never married. She died the day after her 94th birthday.

<text>Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza (, ), often referred to as the Rinas International Airport, is one of the two main international airports of the Republic of Albania. It serves the city of Tirana, its metropolitan area, and surrounding region in the county of Tirana. The airport is named in honor of the Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary, Mother Teresa (1910–1997). It is located northwest of Tirana, in the municipality of Krujë, Durrës County.

The airport serves as the main hub for the Wizz Air and country&#x27;s flag carrier Air Albania. It is the largest airport in Albania and is one of the busiest Balkan airports after reaching 10 million passengers in 2024. On 9 December 2024, the airport celebrated a major milestone by surpassing 10 million passengers.

== History ==

=== Early development ===

The airport was constructed from 1955 to 1957. Tirana had commercial airline services before. Domestic aviation started in 1926 when German airline Adria-Aero-Lloyd obtained a monopoly for domestic air routes in the country and began servicing Tirana, Shkodër, Korçë and Vlorë. These operations proved unprofitable, and the airline sold its rights to Italian company Ala Littoria which opened regular routes in 1935 between Tirana to Shkodër, Kukës, Peshkopia, Kuçova, Vlorë, and Gjirokastër. In 1938, the Yugoslav carrier Aeroput introduced regular commercial flights linking Tirana with Belgrade, Serbia, with a landing in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

After the Second World War and installation of an isolationist communist regime in Albania, air transportation was rare. From 1944 to 1948, there was a service to Belgrade, but after the break of relations with Yugoslavia, until 1953, there was only a twice-a-month connection to Budapest operated by Soviet-Hungarian company Maszovlet. From 1953 to 1955, there was no air service, until February 1955 when a route to Moscow was inaugurated, followed thereafter to other Eastern-European capitals. In the 1970s, Tirana was one of the first European cities to be served by China&#x27;s CAAC Airlines, with a weekly flight to Beijing via Bucharest and Tehran. In the late 1980s, there were six airlines flying to Tirana, with a total of nine round-trips per week.

With the collapse of communism in Albania in 1991 and subsequent liberalisation of travel restrictions abroad for Albanians, the number of airlines operating at the airport increased rapidly. In 1999, there were 8,249 flights and 356,823 passengers, seven times more than in 1991.

=== Contemporary ===
The air traffic equipment and facilities of the airport have been heavily modernised, following investments by Tirana International Airport SHPK, a consortium led by Hochtief AirPort. Hochtief assumed management of the airport on 23 April 2005, for a 20-year concession period.

The concession included the construction of a completely new passenger terminal and various infrastructure improvements, among them the construction of a new access road, new parking lots, and a bridge over the old airport access road. The expansion resulted in an increased number of passengers per annum, estimated at 1.5 million passengers for 2009. The number of passengers effectively increased to more than 1.5 million in 2010.

The terminal building and its second expansion, the cargo building, its landscaping, and its carpark canopies were designed by Malaysian architect Hin Tan of Hintan.

In December 2016, the airport announced that it served 2 million passengers during 2016, reaching its second milestone.

The airport announced over 7.2 million passengers for 2023, exceeding their projections predictions for that year. This statistics marks a substantial increase of 40% compared to the previous year (2022) and 117% compared to the year 2019, solidifying TIA&#x27;s position as a key player in the regional aviation industry.

On 9 December 2024, TIA reached a significant milestone, exceeding 10 million passengers.

== Ownership ==

In 2017, China Everbright Limited became the sole owner of Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza. After reaching an agreement with the Albanian Government to end its monopoly on international flights from Albania, Hochtief AirPort sold the operation of Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza to China Everbright Limited, a company specializing in asset management, direct investment, brokerage and investment banking. On 25 December 2020, Kastrati Group bought all the shares of the airport from China Everbright Limited for 71 million euros.

== Airlines and destinations ==

The following airlines operate regular year-round and seasonal scheduled and charter flights to and from Tirana:

== Ground transport ==

The airport is linked with motorway SH60 away to SH2 Durrës–Tirana access road. Taxis and car rental facilities are available at the airport. The journey from Tirana to the airport takes 20–25 minutes.

=== Bus ===
An airport bus, located outside Arrivals terminal, provides an hourly service that is available 24 hour a day and 7 days a week to/from city centre.

=== Rail ===
A new electrified light rail train line is being built between Tirana and Durrës with a link to Tirana Airport planned to be completed by 2024–25.

== Incidents and accidents ==
*3 October 2006: Turkish Airlines Flight 1476, flying from Tirana to Istanbul, was hijacked by Hakan Ekinci in Greek airspace. The aircraft, with 107 passengers and six crew on board, transmitted two coded hijack signals which were picked up by the Greek air force; the flight was intercepted by military aircraft and landed safely at Brindisi, Italy.
*30 June 2016: Three armed and masked people entered the cargo terminal, where they stole a huge amount of money that was to be transported abroad on airplanes. The amount of cash could have been up to 3 million euros. The incident caused national security concerns.
*9 April 2019: An Austrian Airlines flight headed to Vienna was delayed for 3 hours, following an armed robbery. The aircraft&#x27;s engines were running, when three men wearing masks and military fatigues stepped up to the fuselage, stealing 6 million euros. One of the robbers was shot dead in an exchange of fire with the police about one kilometre from the airport.

<text>Christy Canyon (born June 17, 1966) is a pornographic actress and American radio personality. She is a member of both the AVN and XRCO Halls of Fame and a recipient of the Free Speech Coalition Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Career ==
=== Adult film career ===
Canyon has performed in over 100 pornographic films. She performed actively from September 1984 to March 1985; June 1989 to December 1992; and 1995 to 1997 (as an exclusive contract performer for Vivid Entertainment). She also appeared in photo spreads for &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Swank&quot; magazine.

In her autobiography, Canyon stated that the pornographic actor Greg Rome approached her while she was waiting for a ride in Hollywood, and told her that she would be a terrific figure model. He gave her the business card of adult magazine and film recruiter/agent Jim South, of World Modeling Agency. After visiting South&#x27;s office, Canyon posed for men&#x27;s magazines and began her video career shortly thereafter. Her first on-screen performance was with Ron Jeremy in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Swedish Erotica 57&quot;. She has stated that Jeremy soon afterward became a close friend in the business.

=== Retirement and return ===
Canyon retired from performing in pornographic films in 1997. She remained active in related fields, hosting Playboy Radio&#x27;s &quot;Night Calls&quot; and selling memorabilia on eBay. She has also managed her own X-rated website and self-published an autobiography titled &quot;Lights, Camera, Sex&quot; (2004).

In 2005, she appeared as a judge on the first season of &quot;Jenna&#x27;s American Sex Star&quot;. From 2005 to 2011, she was co-host of the Playboy Radio show &quot;Night Calls.&quot; As of April 2011 she was co-host of Sirius XM&#x27;s &quot;Spice Sex Circus&quot; with Ginger Lynn and sole host of Sirius XM&#x27;s weekly &quot;Legends of Porn.&quot;

Canyon was interviewed for the ABC News program &quot;Nightline&quot; in 2010 for the series &quot;Modern Sex in America&quot;. She co-hosted Radio Sex&#x27;s &quot;You Porn&quot; on Sirius/XM Channel 102, until October 2013 when the channel went off the air. In December 2013, she became the host of &quot;The Christy Canyon Show&quot; on Vivid Radio on Sirius/XM Channel 102.

After a two-decade hiatus, Canyon returned to pornographic performance in March 2017 when she joined OnlyFans, initially offering streamed content and merchandise, and later adding newly shot pornographic scenes. In July 2024, Vixen Media Group announced that Canyon would make adult video content for its MILFY website.

== Recognition ==
Canyon has won several &quot;best female performance&quot;-type awards and is a member of both the XRCO and AVN Halls of Fame.

She was namechecked by English electronic band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) on their 1993 track &quot;Heaven Is&quot;, in the line: &quot;&quot;Heaven is Christy Canyon falling in love with me.&quot; &quot;

<doc id="322375" wikidata="Q434669" url="?curid=322375" title="Phyllis Schlafly">
<text>Phyllis Stewart Schlafly (; born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart; August 15, 1924 – September 5, 2016) was an American attorney, conservative activist, and anti-feminist, who was nationally prominent in conservatism. She held paleoconservative social and political views, opposed feminism, gay rights, and abortion, and campaigned against ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

More than three million copies of her self-published book &quot;A Choice Not an Echo&quot; (1964), a polemic in support of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater and condemning more liberal East Coast Republicans personified by Nelson Rockefeller, were sold or distributed for free. Schlafly co-authored books on national defense, and was critical of arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. In 1972, Schlafly founded the Eagle Forum, a conservative political interest group, and remained its chairwoman and CEO until her death in 2016, while staying active in conservative causes.

==Early life==
Born Phyllis McAlpin Stewart, Schlafly was raised in St. Louis. Schlafly&#x27;s great-grandfather Stewart, a Presbyterian, emigrated from Scotland to New York in 1851 and moved westward through Canada before settling in Michigan. Her grandfather, Andrew F. Stewart, was a master mechanic with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway. Schlafly&#x27;s father, John Bruce Stewart, was a machinist and salesman of industrial equipment, principally for Westinghouse. He was granted a patent in 1944 for a rotary engine.

During the Great Depression, Schlafly&#x27;s father faced long-term unemployment, beginning in 1932. Before her marriage, her mother, Odile Stewart (née Dodge), worked as a teacher at a private girls&#x27; school in St. Louis. During the Depression, she went back to work as a librarian and teacher to support her family. Mrs. Stewart was able to keep the family afloat and maintain Phyllis in a Catholic girls&#x27; school. Phyllis&#x27;s sole sibling was her younger sister, Odile.

=== Education ===
Schlafly attended Maryville College, but after one year, transferred to Washington University in St. Louis. In 1944, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. In 1945, she received a Master of Arts degree in government from Harvard.

In &quot;Strike From Space&quot; (1965), Schlafly wrote that during World War II, she worked as &quot;a ballistics gunner and technician at the largest ammunition plant in the world&quot;. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from the Washington University School of Law in 1978.

==Activism and political efforts==

In 1946, Schlafly became a researcher for the American Enterprise Institute and worked in the successful United States House of Representatives campaign of Republican Claude I. Bakewell.

In 1952, Schlafly ran for Congress as a Republican in the majority Democratic 24th congressional district of Illinois. She won the Republican primary election over John T. R. Godlewski by 18,793 (61.14%) to 11,943 (38.86%). However, she lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Charles Melvin Price, winning 63,778 votes (35.20%) to Price&#x27;s 117,408 votes (64.80%). Schlafly&#x27;s campaign was low-budget and promoted heavily through the local print media, and the major munitions manufacturers John M. Olin and Spencer Truman Olin, and the Texas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt. She was the keynote speaker at the June 1952 Illinois state convention of the Republican Party. In her speech, she accused the Truman administration of &quot;demoralizing our children by bad examples, drafting our men, and confiscating our family income.&quot; In early July 1952, she attended her first Republican National Convention. She would attend each subsequent Republican National Convention until her death. As part of the Illinois delegation of the 1952 convention, Schlafly endorsed U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft to be the party&#x27;s nominee in the presidential election.

She played a major role with her husband in 1957 in writing the &quot;American Bar Association&#x27;s Report on Communist Tactics, Strategy, and Objectives.&quot; Donald T. Critchlow says it &quot;became not only one of the most widely read documents ever produced by the ABA, it was probably the single most widely read publication of the grassroots anticommunist movement.&quot;

Schlafly was elected to serve as an alternate delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention from Illinois&#x27; 24th congressional district. At the convention, Schlafly helped lead a revolt of &quot;moral conservatives&quot; who opposed Richard Nixon&#x27;s stance &quot;against segregation and discrimination.&quot; Schlafly was the Republican nominee for Illinois&#x27;s 24th congressional district again in 1960. She again lost the general election to Price, this time by 144,560 votes (72.22%) to 55,620 (27.79%).

She came to national attention when millions of copies of her self-published book &quot;A Choice Not an Echo&quot; were distributed in support of Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign, especially in California&#x27;s hotly fought winner-take-all-delegates GOP primary. In it, Schlafly denounced the Rockefeller Republicans in the Northeast, accusing them of corruption and globalism. Critics called the book a conspiracy theory about &quot;secret kingmakers&quot; controlling the Republican Party.
Schlafly had previously been a member of the John Birch Society; founder Robert Welch Jr. referred to her as a &quot;very loyal&quot; member. She later quit and denied she had been a member because she feared her association with the organization would damage her book&#x27;s reputation. By mutual agreement her books were not mentioned in the John Birch Society&#x27;s magazine, and the distribution of her books by the society was handled so as to mask their involvement. The society was able to dispense 300,000 copies of &quot;A Choice Not an Echo&quot; in California prior to the June 2, 1964, GOP primary. Gardiner Johnson, Republican National Committee for California, stated that the distribution of her book in California was a major factor in Goldwater&#x27;s winning the nomination.

In 1967, Schlafly lost a bid for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women against the more moderate candidate Gladys O&#x27;Donnell of California. Outgoing NFRW president and future United States Treasurer Dorothy Elston of Delaware worked against Schlafly in the campaign.

In 1970, she ran unsuccessfully for Illinois&#x27;s 23rd congressional district, losing to Democratic incumbent George E. Shipley by 91,158 votes (53.97%) to 77,762 (46.04%). She never sought public office again.

American feminists made their greatest bid for national attention at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston; however, historian Marjorie J. Spruill argues that the anti-feminists led by Schlafly organized a highly successful counter-conference, the Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally, to protest the National Women&#x27;s Conference and make it clear that feminists did not speak for them. At their rally at the Astro Arena they had an overflow of over 15,000 people, and announced the beginning of a pro-family movement to oppose politicians who had been supporting feminism and liberalism, and to promote &quot;family values&quot; in American politics, and so moved the Republican Party to the right and defeated the ratification of the ERA.

===Opposition to Equal Rights Amendment===

Schlafly became an outspoken opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) during the 1970s as the organizer of the &quot;STOP ERA&quot; campaign. STOP was a backronym for &quot;Stop Taking Our Privileges&quot;. She argued that the ERA would take away gender-specific privileges enjoyed by women, including &quot;dependent wife&quot; benefits under Social Security, separate restrooms for males and females, and exemption from Selective Service (the military draft). She was opposed by groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the ERAmerica coalition. The Homemakers&#x27; Equal Rights Association was formed to counter Schlafly&#x27;s campaign.

In 1972, when Schlafly began her campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment, the ERA had already been ratified by 28 of the required 38 states. Seven more states ratified the amendment after Schlafly began organizing opposition, but another five states rescinded their ratifications. The last state to ratify the ERA was Indiana, where State Senator Wayne Townsend cast the tie-breaking vote in January 1977. (Nevada, Illinois and Virginia ratified the ERA between 2017 and 2020, many years after the deadline to do so.)

The Equal Rights Amendment was narrowly defeated, having only achieved ratification in a total 35 states. Political scientist Jane J. Mansbridge concluded in her history of the ERA:

Joan Williams argues, &quot;ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles.&quot; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo argues:

Critics of Schlafly pointed out that she was not a typical housewife, as she was heavily involved in political causes.

===Broadcast media===
In broadcast media, Schlafly provided commentaries on Chicago news radio station WBBM from 1973 to 1975, the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; from 1974 to 1975, and then on CNN from 1980 to 1983. In 1983, she began creating syndicated daily three-minute commentaries for radio. In 1989, she began hosting a weekly radio talk show, &quot;Eagle Forum Live&quot;.

==Viewpoints==

=== Social viewpoints ===

==== Women&#x27;s issues ====
In November 1977, she was an opposition speaker at the 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference with Lottie Beth Hobbs, Dr. Mildred Jefferson, Nellie Gray, and Bob Dornan.
Schlafly told &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1978, &quot;I have cancelled speeches whenever my husband thought that I had been away from home too much.&quot;

In an interview on March 30, 2006, she attributed improvement in women&#x27;s lives during the last decades of the 20th century to labor-saving devices such as the indoor clothes dryer and disposable diapers.

She called &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; &quot;the worst decision in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court&quot; and said that it &quot;is responsible for the killing of millions of unborn babies&quot;.

=====Equal Rights Amendment=====

Schlafly focused political opposition to the ERA in defense of traditional gender roles, such as only men fighting in war. She argued that the Equal Rights Amendment would eliminate the men-only draft and ensure that women would be equally subject to conscription and be required to serve in combat, and that defense of traditional gender roles proved a useful tactic. In Illinois, the anti-ERA activists used traditional symbols of the American housewife, and took homemade foods (bread, jams, apple pies, etc.) to the state legislators, with the slogans, &quot;Preserve us from a congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham&quot; and &quot;I am for Mom and apple pie.&quot;

The historian Lisa Levenstein said that, in the late 1970s, the feminist movement briefly attempted a program to help older divorced and widowed women. Many widows were ineligible for Social Security benefits, few divorcees received alimony, and, after a career as a housewife, few had any work skills with which to enter the labor force. The program, however, encountered sharp criticism from young activists who gave priority to poor minority women rather than to middle-class women. By 1980, NOW downplayed the program, as they focused almost exclusively on ratification of the ERA. Schlafly moved into the political vacuum, and denounced the feminists for abandoning older, middle-class widows and divorcees in need, and warned that the ERA would unbalance the laws in favor of men, stripping legal protections that older women urgently needed.

Schlafly said that the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women, and warned that if men and women had to be treated equally, that social condition would threaten the security of middle-aged housewives without job skills. She also contended that the ERA would repeal legal protections, such as alimony, and eliminate the judicial tendency for divorced mothers to receive custody of their children. Schlafly&#x27;s argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.

In 2007, while working to defeat a new version of the Equal Rights Amendment, Schlafly warned it would force courts to approve same-sex marriages and deny Social Security benefits for housewives and widows.

===== Gender pay gap =====
Schlafly objected to the concept of the gender pay gap, calling it &quot;a deceitful propaganda campaign has been orchestrated by the feminist movement.&quot; She stated that it is &quot;part of the feminists&#x27; denigration of the role of motherhood [...] designed to eliminate [...] motherhood by changing us into a society in which women are harnessed into the labor force both full-time and for a lifetime&quot;. In fact, she believed that even if men do earn more than women, it is beneficial to society as a whole, because, &quot;we want a society in which the average man earns more than the average woman so that his earnings can fulfill his provider role in providing a home and support for his wife who is nurturing and mothering their children.&quot; She stated: &quot;We certainly don&#x27;t want a society in which the average wage paid to all women equals [that of] men, because that society would have eliminated the role of motherhood.&quot;

==== Motherhood ====
Schlafly believed that the primary role of a woman should be that of wife, mother, and homemaker rather than career woman. She also believed that motherhood is crucial to the well-being of society, stating: &quot;[Motherhood] is the most socially useful role of all&quot; and &quot;the dependent wife and mother who cares for her own children...performs the most socially necessary role in our society.&quot;

==== Differences between men and women ====
Schlafly held the position that men and women are fundamentally different and opposed what she termed the &quot;feminist [propagandist]&quot; assertion that &quot;we must redesign society to become gender neutral and that men must shed their macho image and remake themselves to become househusbands.&quot; Instead, she believed that it was not possible to eradicate the differences between men and women. She argued that feminists &quot;will have to take up their complaint with God,&quot; because &quot;no other power can alter the fundamental and necessary differences between men and women.&quot;

==== Family ====
Schlafly contended that the family is the place of greatest growth and satisfaction for women. She rejected what she claimed is the feminist view that the family is an anachronism that binds women down. She believed that the institution of the family as &quot;the basic unit of society [...] is the greatest single achievement in the entire history of women&#x27;s rights.&quot; She stated that &quot;the future of our nation depends on children who grow up to be good citizens, and the best way of achieving that goal is to have emotionally stable, intact families.&quot;

==== Marriage ====
In March 2007, Schlafly spoke against the concept of marital rape in a speech at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, &quot;By getting married, the woman has consented to sex, and I don&#x27;t think you can call it rape.&quot;

Schlafly argued that in marriage, men and women&#x27;s roles are different and should remain so. She defended her stance as one necessary to order instead of a threat to equality; she said, &quot;If marriage is to be a successful institution, it must...have an ultimate decision maker, and that is the husband.&quot;

===== Same-sex marriage =====
Schlafly opposed same-sex marriage and civil unions: &quot;[a]ttacks on the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman come from the gay lobby seeking social recognition of their lifestyle.&quot; Linking the Equal Rights Amendment to LGBT rights and same-sex marriage played a role in Schlafly&#x27;s opposition to the ERA.

=== United Nations and international relations ===
Over the years, Schlafly disdained the United Nations. On the 50th anniversary of the UN in 1995, she referred to it as &quot;a cause for mourning, not celebration. It is a monument to foolish hopes, embarrassing compromises, betrayal of our servicemen, and a steady stream of insults to our nation. It is a Trojan Horse that carries the enemy into our midst and lures Americans to ride under alien insignia to fight and die in faraway lands.&quot; She opposed President Bill Clinton&#x27;s decision in 1996 to send 20,000 American troops to Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars. Schlafly observed that Balkan nations have fought one another for 500 years and argued that the U.S. military should not be &quot;policemen&quot; of world trouble spots.

Prior to the 1994 Congressional elections, Schlafly condemned globalization through the World Trade Organization as a &quot;direct attack on American sovereignty, independence, jobs, and economy ... any country that must change its laws to obey rulings of a world organization has sacrificed its sovereignty.&quot;

In late 2006, Schlafly collaborated with Jerome Corsi and Howard Phillips to create a website in opposition to the idea of a &quot;North American Union&quot;, under which the United States, Mexico, and Canada would share a currency and be integrated in a structure similar to the European Union.

During the Cold War, Schlafly opposed arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. In 1961, she wrote that &quot;[arms control] will not stop Red aggression any more than disarming our local police will stop murder, theft, and rape.&quot;

===Judicial system===
Schlafly was an outspoken critic of what she termed &quot;activist judges&quot;, particularly on the Supreme Court. In 2005, Schlafly made headlines at a conference for the Judeo-Christian Council for Constitutional Restoration by suggesting that &quot;Congress ought to talk about impeachment&quot; of Justice Anthony Kennedy, citing as specific grounds Justice Kennedy&#x27;s deciding vote to abolish the death penalty for minors.

In April 2010, shortly after John Paul Stevens announced his retirement as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Schlafly called for the appointment of a military veteran to the Court. Stevens had been a veteran and, with his retirement, the court was &quot;at risk of being left without a single military veteran.&quot;

=== Immigration proposals ===
Schlafly believed the Republican Party should reject immigration reform proposals; she told &quot;Focus Today&quot; that it is a &quot;great myth&quot; that the GOP needs to reach out to Latinos in the United States. &quot;The people the Republicans should reach out to are the white votes, the white voters who didn&#x27;t vote in the last election. The propagandists are leading us down the wrong path ... [T]here&#x27;s not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican.&quot;

=== Presidential elections ===

Schlafly did not endorse a candidate for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, but she spoke out against Mike Huckabee, who, she says, as governor left the Republican Party in Arkansas &quot;in shambles&quot;. At the Eagle Forum, she hosted U.S. Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado, known for his opposition to illegal immigration. Before his election, she criticized Barack Obama as &quot;an elitist who worked with words&quot;.

During the election, she endorsed John McCain in an interview by saying: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m a Republican, I&#x27;m supporting McCain&quot;. When asked about criticism of John McCain from Rush Limbaugh, she said: &quot;Well, there are problems, we are trying to teach him&quot;.

Schlafly endorsed Michele Bachmann in December 2011 for the Iowa caucus of the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, citing Bachmann&#x27;s work against &quot;ObamaCare&quot; and deficit spending and Bachmann&#x27;s support of &quot;traditional values.&quot;
On February 3, 2012, Schlafly announced that she would be voting for Rick Santorum in that year&#x27;s Missouri Republican primary. In 2016, she endorsed Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy for president. The endorsement soon led to a breach in the Eagle Forum board. Schlafly broke with six dissident members, including her daughter, Anne Cori, and Cathie Adams, the former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party. Adams instead supported U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Trump&#x27;s principal challenger whom Adams considered a more conservative choice.

Schlafly&#x27;s last book, &quot;The Conservative Case for Trump&quot;, was published September 6, 2016, one day after her death.

==Honorary degree and protests==
On May 1, 2008, the trustees of Washington University in St. Louis, announced that Schlafly would receive an honorary degree at the graduation ceremony for the Class of 2008. This news was met with objection from some students and faculty, who complained she was anti-feminist and criticized her work in defeating the Equal Rights Amendment. 
In a letter, fourteen law professors complained Schlafly&#x27;s career demonstrated &quot;anti-intellectualism in pursuit of a political agenda.&quot;

While the trustees&#x27; honorary-degree committee unanimously approved who would be honored, five student-members of the committee complained, in writing, that they were required to vote for the five people to be honored, as a slate, rather than individually, and thought that the selection of Schlafly was a mistake, despite her prominence as a famous graduate of Washington University. In the days before the graduation ceremony, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton explained the trustees&#x27; decision to award Schlafly an honorary degree with the following statement of disclaimer:In bestowing this degree, the University is not endorsing Mrs. Schlafly&#x27;s views or opinions; rather, it is recognizing an alumna of the University whose life and work have had a broad impact on American life and have sparked widespread debate and controversies that in many cases have helped people better formulate and articulate their own views about the values they hold.

At the May 16, 2008, commencement ceremony, Schlafly was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, yet faculty and students protested to rescind Schlafly&#x27;s honorary degree. During the ceremony, hundreds of the 14,000 people in attendance, including one-third of the graduating class and some faculty, silently stood and turned their backs to Schlafly in protest. In the days before the commencement there were protests regarding the awarding of an honorary degree; Schlafly described the protesters as &quot;a bunch of losers&quot;. Moreover, after the ceremony, Schlafly said that the protesters were &quot;juvenile&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re mature enough to graduate.&quot; As planned, Schlafly did not address the graduating class, nor did any other honored guest, except for the commencement speaker, news commentator Chris Matthews of MSNBC.

==Personal life==
On October 20, 1949, she married attorney John Fred Schlafly Jr., a member of a wealthy St. Louis family; he died in 1993. His grandfather, August, immigrated in 1854 from Switzerland. In the late 1870s, the three brothers founded the firm of Schlafly Bros., which dealt in groceries, Queensware (dishes made by Wedgwood), hardware, and agricultural implements. Fred and Phyllis Schlafly were both active Catholics. They linked Catholicism to Americanism and often exhorted Catholics to join the anti-communist crusade.

Fred and Phyllis Schlafly moved across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, and had six children: John, Bruce, Roger, Liza, Andrew, and Anne. When her husband died in 1993, she moved to Ladue, Missouri. In 1992, their eldest son, lawyer John Schlafly, was outed as gay by &quot;Queer Week&quot; magazine. He acknowledged that he was gay and stated that he agreed with his mother&#x27;s opposition to same-sex marriage and extension of civil rights protection to gays and lesbians. Their son Andrew, also a lawyer and activist, created the wiki-based Conservapedia. Their daughter Anne Schlafly Cori, married to the son of Nobel-winning scientists Carl and Gerty Cori, is chairman and treasurer of Eagle Forum.

Schlafly was the aunt of conservative anti-feminist author Suzanne Venker; together they wrote &quot;The Flipside of Feminism: What Conservative Women Know – and Men Can&#x27;t Say&quot;.

Schlafly died of cancer on September 5, 2016, at her home in Ladue, Missouri, at the age of 92.

==In popular culture==
Phyllis Schlafly is mentioned extensively in the seventh episode of the third season of the comedy TV series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, titled &quot;Marvelous Radio&quot;. Set in 1960, the episode sees Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) agreeing to participate in a live radio commercial for Schlafly. Initially, Midge is enthusiastic about the prospect of supporting a woman running for Congress. However, after learning about her views, which are portrayed as ultra-conservative and antisemitic, she changes her mind and refuses to speak her part, while already at the recording studio with the broadcast about to start.

The FX miniseries &quot;Mrs. America&quot; also partially focuses on Schlafly&#x27;s life and activism, with Cate Blanchett portraying Schlafly. Though some praise the series for its accuracy, Schlafly&#x27;s family members, among other critics, dispute the accuracy of several accounts in the series.

Schlafly is briefly referred to in the Margaret Atwood novel &quot;The Testaments.&quot; The 2019 sequel to Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Testaments&quot; is set in a dystopian theocratic state in which women are segregated by caste and social function, including wives, housekeepers, teachers, and impregnable women. In this setting is the &quot;Schlafly Café&quot; which is open to women in the &quot;Aunt&quot; or teacher caste.

<text>Ecological succession is the process of change in the species that make up an ecological community over time.

The process of succession occurs either after the initial colonization of a newly created habitat, or after a disturbance substantially alters a pre-existing habitat. Succession that begins in new habitats, uninfluenced by pre-existing communities, is called primary succession, whereas succession that follows disruption of a pre-existing community is called secondary succession. Primary succession may happen after a lava flow or the emergence of a new island from the ocean. Surtsey, a volcanic island off the southern coast of Iceland, is an important example of a place where primary succession has been observed. On the other hand, secondary succession happens after disturbance of a community, such as from a fire, severe windthrow, or logging.

Succession was among the first theories advanced in ecology. Ecological succession was first documented in the Indiana Dunes of Northwest Indiana and remains an important ecological topic of study. Over time, the understanding of succession has changed from a linear progression to a stable climax state, to a more complex, cyclical model that de-emphasizes the idea of organisms having fixed roles or relationships.

== History ==
Precursors of the idea of ecological succession go back to the beginning of the 19th century. As early as 1742 French naturalist Buffon noted that poplars precede oaks and beeches in the natural evolution of a forest. Buffon was later forced by the theological committee at the University of Paris to recant many of his ideas because they contradicted the biblical narrative of Creation.

Swiss geologist Jean-André Deluc and the later French naturalist Adolphe Dureau de la Malle were the first to make use of the word &quot;succession&quot; concerning the vegetation development after forest clear-cutting. In 1859 Henry David Thoreau wrote an address called &quot;The Succession of Forest Trees&quot; in which he described succession in an oak-pine forest. &quot;It has long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the ground, but I am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular succession of forests.&quot; The Austrian botanist Anton Kerner published a study about the succession of plants in the Danube river basin in 1863.

Ragnar Hult&#x27;s 1885 study on the stages of forest development in Blekinge noted that grassland becomes heath before the heath develops into forest. Birch dominated the early stages of forest development, then pine (on dry soil) and spruce (on wet soil). If the birch is replaced by oak it eventually develops to beechwood. Swamps proceed from moss to sedges to moor vegetation followed by birch and finally spruce.

===H. C. Cowles===
 Between 1899 and 1910, Henry Chandler Cowles, at the University of Chicago, developed a more formal concept of succession. Inspired by studies of Danish dunes by Eugen Warming, Cowles studied vegetation development on sand dunes on the shores of Lake Michigan (the Indiana Dunes). He recognized that vegetation on dunes of different ages might be interpreted as different stages of a general trend of vegetation development on dunes (an approach to the study of vegetation change later termed space-for-time substitution, or chronosequence studies). He first published this work as a paper in the &quot;Botanical Gazette&quot; in 1899 (&quot;The ecological relations of the vegetation of the sand dunes of Lake Michigan&quot;). In this classic publication and subsequent papers, he formulated the idea of primary succession and the notion of a sere—a repeatable sequence of community changes specific to particular environmental circumstances.

===Gleason and Clements===
From about 1900 to 1960, however, understanding of succession was dominated by the theories of Frederic Clements, a contemporary of Cowles, who held that seres were highly predictable and deterministic and converged on a climatically determined stable climax community regardless of starting conditions. Clements explicitly analogized the successional development of ecological communities with ontogenetic development of individual organisms, and his model is often referred to as the pseudo-organismic theory of community ecology. Clements and his followers developed a complex taxonomy of communities and successional pathways.

Henry Gleason offered a contrasting framework as early as the 1920s. The Gleasonian model was more complex and much less deterministic than the Clementsian. It differs most fundamentally from the Clementsian view in suggesting a much greater role of chance factors and in denying the existence of coherent, sharply bounded community types. Gleason argued that species distributions responded individualistically to environmental factors, and communities were best regarded as artifacts of the juxtaposition of species distributions. Gleason&#x27;s ideas, first published in 1926, were largely ignored until the late 1950s.

Two quotes illustrate the contrasting views of Clements and Gleason. Clements wrote in 1916:
while Gleason, in his 1926 paper, said:
Gleason&#x27;s ideas were, in fact, more consistent with Cowles&#x27; original thinking about succession. About Clements&#x27; distinction between primary succession and secondary succession, Cowles wrote (1911):

===Eugene Odum===
In 1969, Eugene Odum published &quot;The Strategy of Ecosystem Development&quot;, a paper that was highly influential to conservation and environmental restoration. Odum argued that ecological succession was an orderly progression toward a climax state where “maximum biomass and symbiotic function between organisms are maintained per unit energy flow.&quot; Odum highlighted how succession was not merely a change in the species composition of an ecosystem, but also created change in more complex attributes of the ecosystem, such as structure and nutrient cycling.

===Modern era===
A more rigorous, data-driven testing of successional models and community theory generally began with the work of Robert Whittaker and John Curtis in the 1950s and 1960s. Succession theory has since become less monolithic and more complex. J. Connell and R. Slatyer attempted a codification of successional processes by mechanism. Among British and North American ecologists, the notion of a stable climax vegetation has been largely abandoned, and successional processes have come to be seen as much less deterministic, with important roles for historical contingency and for alternate pathways in the actual development of communities. Debates continue as to the general predictability of successional dynamics and the relative importance of equilibrial vs. non-equilibrial processes. Former Harvard professor Fakhri A. Bazzaz introduced the notion of &quot;scale&quot; into the discussion, as he considered that at local or small area scale the processes are stochastic and patchy, but taking bigger regional areas into consideration, certain tendencies can not be denied.

More recent definitions of succession highlight change as the central characteristic. New research techniques are greatly enhancing contemporary scientists&#x27; ability to study succession, which is now seen as neither entirely random nor entirely predictable.

==Factors==
Both consistent patterns and variability are observed in ecological succession. Theories of ecological succession identify different factors that help explain why plant communities change the way they do. 

===Diversity of possible trajectories===
Ecological succession was formerly seen as an orderly progression through distinct stages, where several plant communities would replace each other in a fixed order and eventually reach a stable end point known as the climax. The climax community was sometimes referred to as the &#x27;potential vegetation&#x27; of a site, and thought to be primarily determined by the local climate. This idea has been largely abandoned by modern ecologists in favor of nonequilibrium ideas of ecosystems dynamics. Most natural ecosystems experience disturbance at a rate that makes a &quot;climax&quot; community unattainable. Climate change often occurs at a rate and frequency sufficient to prevent arrival at a climax state. 

The trajectory of successional change can be influenced by initial site conditions, by the type of disturbance that triggers succession, by the interactions of the species present, and by more random factors such as availability of colonists or seeds or weather conditions at the time of disturbance. Some aspects of succession are broadly predictable; others may proceed more unpredictably than in the classical view of ecological succession. Coupled with the stochastic nature of disturbance events and other long-term (e.g., climatic) changes, such dynamics make it doubtful whether the &#x27;climax&#x27; concept ever applies or is particularly useful in considering actual vegetation.

===Stochastic events===
Succession is influenced partially by random chance, but it is debated how much random chance directs the trajectory of succession, as opposed to more deterministic factors. The timing of a disturbance such as a weather event may be random and unpredictable. Dispersal of propagules to a new site may also be random. However, community assembly is also determined by processes that select species non-randomly from the local species pool.

===Dispersal limitation vs. environmental filtering===
Succession is impacted both by the ability of seeds to disperse to new sites, and the suitability of site conditions for those seeds to grow and survive. Dispersal limitation means that even though favorable sites for a plant to live might exist, the plant&#x27;s seeds may be unable to reach those sites. Environmental filtering, also called establishment limitation, implies that although seeds may be distributed to a site, those seeds may be unable to survive due to various characteristics of the site. The predicted impact of these two factors varies under different models of ecological succession. 

===Feedback loops=== 
Ecological succession is driven by feedbacks between plants and their environment. As plants grow following a disturbance, they change their environment, for example by creating shade, attracting seed dispersers, contributing organic matter to the soil, changing the availability of soil nutrients, creating microhabitats, and buffering temperature and moisture fluctuations. This creates opportunities for different plants to grow, which causes directional change in the ecosystem. The development of some ecosystem attributes, such as soil properties and nutrient cycles, are both influenced by community properties, and, in turn, influence further successional development. This feed-back process may occur over centuries or millennia. Plants may facilitate the establishment of other plants by creating suitable conditions for them to grow, for example by providing shade or allowing for soil formation. Plants may also competitively exclude or otherwise prevent the growth of other plants. 

===Patterns===
Though the idea of a fixed, predictable process of succession with a single well-defined climax is an overly simplified model, several predictions made by the classical model are accurate. Species diversity, overall plant biomass, plant lifespans, the importance of decomposer organisms, and overall stability all increase as a community approaches a climax state, while the rate at which soil nutrients are consumed, rate of biogeochemical cycling, and rate of net primary productivity all decrease as a community approaches a climax state.

Communities in early succession will be dominated by fast-growing, well-dispersed species (opportunist, fugitive, or r-selected life-histories). These are also called pioneer species. As succession proceeds, these species will tend to be replaced by more competitive (k-selected) species.

Some of these trends do not apply in all cases. For example, species diversity almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates opportunistic species and leads to dominance by locally superior competitors. Net Primary Productivity, biomass, and trophic properties all show variable patterns over succession, depending on the particular system and site.

===Disruptions===

Two important perturbation factors today are human actions and climatic change. Additions to available species pools through range expansions and introductions can also continually reshape communities.

==Types of succession==

===Primary succession===
The successional dynamics beginning with colonization of an area with little to no biotic factors is referred to as primary succession. This includes newly exposed rock or sand surfaces, lava flows, and newly exposed glacial tills. The stages of primary succession include pioneer species such as microorganisms, plants (lichens and mosses), grasses, smaller shrubs, and trees. Small animals move into the area when enough suitable habitat has been established. When it is a fully functioning ecosystem, it has reached the climax community stage.

===Secondary succession===


Secondary succession follows severe disturbance or removal of a preexisting community that has remnants of the previous ecosystem. Secondary succession is strongly influenced by pre-disturbance conditions such as soil development, seed banks, remaining organic matter, and residual living organisms. Because of residual fertility and preexisting organisms, community change in early stages of secondary succession can be relatively rapid.

Secondary succession is much more commonly observed and studied than primary succession. Particularly common types of secondary succession include responses to natural disturbances such as fire, flood, and severe winds, and to human-caused disturbances such as logging and agriculture. In secondary succession, the soils and organisms need to be left unharmed so there is a way for the new material to rebuild.

As an example, in a fragmented old field habitat created in eastern Kansas, woody plants &quot;colonized more rapidly (per unit area) on large and nearby patches&quot;.
Secondary succession can quickly change a landscape. In the 1900s, Acadia National Park had a wildfire that destroyed much of the landscape. Originally evergreen trees grew in the landscape. After the fire, the area took at least a year to grow shrubs. Eventually, deciduous trees started to grow instead of evergreens.

Secondary succession has been occurring in Shenandoah National Park following the 1995 flood of the Moorman&#x27;s and Rapidan rivers, which destroyed plant and animal life.

===Seasonal and cyclic dynamics===
Unlike secondary succession, these types of vegetation change are not dependent on disturbance but are periodic changes arising from fluctuating species interactions or recurring events. These models modify the climax concept towards one of dynamic states.

===Causes of plant succession===

Autogenic succession can be brought by changes in the soil caused by the organisms there. These changes include accumulation of organic matter in litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, or change in the pH of soil due to the plants growing there. The structure of the plants themselves can also alter the community. For example, when larger species like trees mature, they produce shade on to the developing forest floor that tends to exclude light-requiring species. Shade-tolerant species will invade the area.

Allogenic succession is caused by external environmental influences and not by the vegetation. For example, soil changes due to erosion, leaching or the deposition of silt and clays can alter the nutrient content and water relationships in the ecosystems. Animals also play an important role in allogenic changes as they are pollinators, seed dispersers and herbivores. They can also increase nutrient content of the soil in certain areas, or shift soil about (as termites, ants, and moles do) creating patches in the habitat. This may create regeneration sites that favor certain species.

Climatic factors may be very important, but on a much longer time-scale than any other. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns will promote changes in communities. As the climate warmed at the end of each ice age, great successional changes took place. The tundra vegetation and bare glacial till deposits underwent succession to mixed deciduous forest. The greenhouse effect resulting in increase in temperature is likely to bring profound Allogenic changes in the next century. Geological and climatic catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, avalanches, meteors, floods, fires, and high wind also bring allogenic changes.

===Mechanisms===

In 1916, Frederic Clements published a descriptive theory of succession and advanced it as a general ecological concept. His theory of succession had a powerful influence on ecological thought. Clements&#x27; concept is usually termed classical ecological theory.
According to Clements, succession is a process involving several phases:

# Nudation: Succession begins with the development of a bare site, called Nudation (disturbance).
# Migration: refers to arrival of propagules.
# Ecesis: involves establishment and initial growth of vegetation.
# Competition: as vegetation becomes well established, grows, and spreads, various species begin to compete for space, light and nutrients.
# Reaction: during this phase autogenic changes such as the buildup of humus affect the habitat, and one plant community replaces another.
# Stabilization: a supposedly stable climax community forms.

==Seral communities==

A seral community is an intermediate stage found in an ecosystem advancing towards its climax community. In many cases more than one seral stage evolves until climax conditions are attained. A &quot;prisere&quot; is a collection of seres making up the development of an area from non-vegetated surfaces to a climax community. Depending on the substratum and climate, different seres are found.

==Changes in animal life==
Succession theory was developed primarily by botanists. The study of succession applied to whole ecosystems initiated in the writings of Ramon Margalef, while Eugene Odum&#x27;s publication of &quot;The Strategy of Ecosystem Development&quot; is considered its formal starting point.

Animal life also exhibits changes with changing communities. In the lichen stage, fauna is sparse. It comprises a few mites, ants, and spiders living in cracks and crevices. The fauna undergoes a qualitative increase during the herb grass stage. The animals found during this stage include nematodes, insect larvae, ants, spiders, mites, etc. The animal population increases and diversifies with the development of the forest climax community. The fauna consists of invertebrates like slugs, snails, worms, millipedes, centipedes, ants, bugs; and vertebrates such as squirrels, foxes, mice, moles, snakes, various birds, salamanders and frogs.

A review of succession research by Hodkinson et al. (2002) documented what was likely first noted by Darwin during his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle:
 
These naturalists note that prior to the establishment of autotrophs, there is a foodweb formed by heterotrophs built on allochthonous inputs of dead organic matter (necromass). Work on volcanic systems such as Kasatochi Volcano in the Aleutians by Sikes and Slowik (2010) supports this idea.
==Microsuccession==

Succession of micro-organisms including fungi and bacteria occurring within a microhabitat is known as microsuccession or serule. In artificial bacterial meta-communities of motile strains &quot;on-chip&quot; it has been shown that ecological succession is based on a trade-off between colonization and competition abilities. To exploit locations or explore the landscape? &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is a fugitive species, whereas &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; is a slower colonizer but superior competitor. Like in plants, microbial succession can occur in newly available habitats (primary succession) such as surfaces of plant leaves, recently exposed rock surfaces (i.e., glacial till) or animal infant guts, and also on disturbed communities (secondary succession) like those growing in recently dead trees, decaying fruits, or animal droppings. Microbial communities may also change due to products secreted by the bacteria present. Changes of pH in a habitat could provide ideal conditions for a new species to inhabit the area. In some cases the new species may outcompete the present ones for nutrients leading to the primary species demise. Changes can also occur by microbial succession with variations in water availability and temperature. Theories of macroecology have only recently been applied to microbiology and so much remains to be understood about this growing field. A recent study of microbial succession evaluated the balances between stochastic and deterministic processes in the bacterial colonization of a salt marsh chronosequence. The results of this study show that, much like in macro succession, early colonization (primary succession) is mostly influenced by stochasticity while secondary succession of these bacterial communities was more strongly influenced by deterministic factors.
==Climax concept==
According to classical ecological theory, succession stops when the sere has arrived at an equilibrium or steady state with the physical and biotic environment. Barring major disturbances, it will persist indefinitely. This end point of succession is called climax.

===Climax community===
The final or stable community in a sere is the &quot;climax community&quot; or &quot;climatic vegetation&quot;. It is self-perpetuating and in equilibrium with the physical habitat. There is no net annual accumulation of organic matter in a climax community. The annual production and use of energy is balanced in such a community.

===Characteristics===

* The vegetation is tolerant of environmental conditions.
* It has a wide diversity of species, a well-drained spatial structure, and complex food chains.
* The climax ecosystem is balanced. There is equilibrium between gross primary production and total respiration, between energy used from sunlight and energy released by decomposition, between uptake of nutrients from the soil and the return of nutrient by litter fall to the soil.
* Individuals in the climax stage are replaced by others of the same kind. Thus the species composition maintains equilibrium.
* It is an index of the climate of the area. The life or growth forms indicate the climatic type.

===Types of climax===

; Climatic Climax: If there is only a single climax and the development of climax community is controlled by the climate of the region, it is termed as climatic climax. For example, development of Maple-beech climax community over moist soil. Climatic climax is theoretical and develops where physical conditions of the substrate are not so extreme as to modify the effects of the prevailing regional climate.
; Edaphic Climax: When there are more than one climax communities in the region, modified by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity, it is called &quot;edaphic climax&quot;. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.
; Catastrophic Climax: Climax vegetation vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as a wildfire. For example, in California, chaparral vegetation is the final vegetation. The wildfire removes the mature vegetation and decomposers. A rapid development of herbaceous vegetation follows until the shrub dominance is re-established. This is known as catastrophic climax.
; Disclimax: When a stable community, which is not the climatic or edaphic climax for the given site, is maintained by man or his domestic animals, it is designated as Disclimax (disturbance climax) or anthropogenic subclimax (man-generated). For example, overgrazing by stock may produce a desert community of bushes and cacti where the local climate actually would allow grassland to maintain itself.
; Subclimax: The prolonged stage in succession just preceding the climatic climax is &quot;subclimax&quot;.
; Preclimax and Postclimax: In certain areas different climax communities develop under similar climatic conditions. If the community has life forms lower than those in the expected climatic climax, it is called &quot;preclimax&quot;; a community that has life forms higher than those in the expected climatic climax is &quot;postclimax&quot;. Preclimax strips develop in less moist and hotter areas, whereas Postclimax strands develop in more moist and cooler areas than that of surrounding climate.

===Theories===

There are three schools of interpretations explaining the climax concept:

* Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was advanced by Clements (1916) and recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification of environment overcome the effects of differences in topography, parent material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and disclimax.
* Polyclimax Theory was advanced by Tansley (1935). It proposes that the climax vegetation of a region consists of more than one vegetation climaxes controlled by soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope exposure, fire, and animal activity.
* Climax Pattern Theory was proposed by Whittaker (1953). The climax pattern theory recognizes a variety of climaxes governed by responses of species populations to biotic and abiotic conditions. According to this theory the total environment of the ecosystem determines the composition, species structure, and balance of a climax community. The environment includes the species&#x27; responses to moisture, temperature, and nutrients, their biotic relationships, availability of flora and fauna to colonize the area, chance dispersal of seeds and animals, soils, climate, and disturbance such as fire and wind. The nature of climax vegetation will change as the environment changes. The climax community represents a pattern of populations that corresponds to and changes with the pattern of environment. The central and most widespread community is the climatic climax.

The theory of alternative stable states suggests there is not one end point but many which transition between each other over ecological time.

==Succession by habitat type==
===Forest succession===

Forests, being an ecological system, are subject to the species succession process. There are &quot;opportunistic&quot; or &quot;pioneer&quot; species that produce great quantities of seed that are disseminated by the wind, and therefore can colonize big empty extensions. They are capable of germinating and growing in direct sunlight. Once they have produced a &quot;closed canopy&quot;, the lack of direct sun radiation at the soil makes it difficult for their own seedlings to develop. It is then the opportunity for shade-tolerant species to become established under the protection of the pioneers. When the pioneers die, the shade-tolerant species replace them. These species are capable of growing beneath the canopy, and therefore, in the absence of disturbances, will stay. For this reason it is then said the stand has reached its climax. When a disturbance occurs, the opportunity for the pioneers opens up again, provided they are present or within a reasonable range.

An example of pioneer species, in forests of northeastern North America are &quot;Betula papyrifera&quot; (White birch) and &quot;Prunus serotina&quot; (Black cherry), that are particularly well-adapted to exploit large gaps in forest canopies, but are intolerant of shade and are eventually replaced by other shade-tolerant species in the absence of disturbances that create such gaps. In the tropics, well known pioneer forest species can be found among the genera &quot;Cecropia&quot;, &quot;Ochroma&quot; and &quot;Trema&quot;.

Things in nature are not black and white, and there are intermediate stages. It is therefore normal that between the two extremes of light and shade there is a gradient, and there are species that may act as pioneer or tolerant, depending on the circumstances. It is of paramount importance to know the tolerance of species in order to practice an effective silviculture.

===Wetland succession===
Since many types of wetland environments exist, succession may follow a wide array of trajectories and patterns in wetlands. Under the classical model, the process of secondary succession holds that a wetland progresses over time from an initial state of open water with few plants, to a forested climax state where decayed organic matter has built up over time, forming peat. However, many wetlands are maintained by regular disturbance or natural processes at an equilibrium state that does not resemble the predicted forested &quot;climax.&quot; The idea that ponds and wetlands gradually fill in to become dry land has been criticized and called into question due to lack of evidence.

Wetland succession is a uniquely complex, non-linear process shaped by hydrology. Hydrological factors often work against linear processes that predict a succession to a &quot;climax&quot; state. The energy carried by moving water may create a continuous source of disturbance. For example, in coastal wetlands, the tides moving in and out continuously acts upon the ecological community. Fire may also maintain an equilibrium state in a wetland by burning off vegetation, thus interrupting the accumulation of peat. 
Water entering and leaving the wetland follows patterns that are broadly cyclical but erratic. For example, seasonal flooding and drying may occur with yearly changes in precipitation, causing seasonal changes in the wetland community that maintain it at a stable state. However, unusually heavy rain or unusually severe drought may cause the wetland to enter a positive feedback loop where it begins to change in a linear direction. Since wetlands are sensitive to changes in the natural processes that maintain them, human activities, invasive species, and climate change could initiate long-term changes in wetland ecosystems.

===Grassland succession===
For a long time, grasslands were thought to be early stages of succession, dominated by weedy species and with little conservation value. However, comparing grasslands that form after recovery from long-term disruptions like agricultural tillage with ancient or &quot;old-growth&quot; grasslands has shown that grasslands are not inherently early-successional communities. Rather, grasslands undergo a centuries-long process of succession, and a grassland that is tilled up for agriculture or otherwise destroyed is estimated to take a minimum of 100 years, and potentially on average 1,400 years, to recover to its previous level of biodiversity. However, planting a high diversity of late-successional grassland species in a disturbed environment can accelerate the recovery of the soil&#x27;s ability to sequester carbon, resulting in twice as much carbon storage as a naturally recovering grassland over the same period of time.

Many grassland ecosystems are maintained by disturbance, such as fire and grazing by large animals, or else the process of succession will change them to forest or shrubland. In fact, it is debated whether fire should be considered disturbance at all for the North American prairie ecosystems, since it maintains, rather than disrupts, an equilibrium state. Many late-successional grassland species have adaptations that allow them to store nutrients underground and re-sprout rapidly after &quot;aboveground&quot; disturbances like fire or grazing. Disturbance events that severely disrupt or destroy the soil, such as tilling, eliminate these late-successional species, reverting the grassland to an early successional stage dominated by pioneers, whereas fire and grazing benefit late-successional species. Both too much and too little disturbance can damage the biodiversity of disturbance-dependent ecosystems like grasslands.

In North American semi-arid grasslands, the introduction of livestock ranching and absence of fire was observed to cause a transition away from grasses to woody vegetation, particularly mesquite. However, the means by which ecological succession under frequent disturbance results in ecosystems of the sort seen in remnant prairies is poorly understood.

<doc id="322377" wikidata="Q332552" url="?curid=322377" title="Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife">
<text>Alexander William George Duff, 1st Duke of Fife (10 November 1849 – 29 January 1912), styled Viscount Macduff between 1857 and 1879 and known as the Earl Fife between 1879 and 1889, was a Scottish nobleman and peer who married Princess Louise, the third child and eldest daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

== Early life ==
Fife was born Alexander Duff in Edinburgh, the son of James Duff (later 5th Earl Fife) and his wife, Lady Agnes Hay. His father was a grandson of the 3rd Earl Fife and heir presumptive to the 4th Earl Fife. His mother was the second daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll and his wife, Elizabeth FitzClarence, an illegitimate daughter of King William IV. When his father succeeded as 5th Earl Fife in 1857, Duff acquired the courtesy title of &quot;Viscount Macduff&quot;. He attended Eton from 1863 to 1866.

==Political and diplomatic career==
In 1872, while known as Viscount Macduff, Fife became Lord-Lieutenant of Elginshire in Scotland and continued in the position for thirty years. From 1874 to 1879, he also served as Member of Parliament for Elginshire and Nairnshire, standing as a Liberal. On 7 August 1879, he succeeded his father as 6th Earl Fife in the Peerage of Ireland (and as 2nd Baron Skene in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, thus gaining a seat in the House of Lords. At this time, he also succeeded in a number of Scottish feudal baronies, including MacDuff, which was named for James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife. He served in the Liberal government of William Ewart Gladstone as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from May 1880 to January 1881, and served on a special diplomatic mission to invest the King of Saxony with the Order of the Garter in February 1882. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Banffshire Artillery Volunteers on 15 March 1884. In 1885, Queen Victoria created him &quot;Earl of Fife&quot; in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He took part in the founding of the Chartered Company of South Africa and served as one of its vice presidents until the Jameson Raid of 1896. He was Lord Lieutenant of the County of London from February 1900 until his death in 1912.

==Marriage==

On Saturday 27 July 1889, Lord Fife married Princess Louise, the eldest daughter of the then-Prince and Princess of Wales, at the Private Chapel at Buckingham Palace. The couple were third cousins in descent from George III. The wedding marked the second time a descendant of Queen Victoria married a British subject (the first being the marriage of Princess Louise, the Queen&#x27;s fourth daughter, to the Duke of Argyll). On the day of the wedding, the Queen elevated Lord Fife to the further dignity of Duke of Fife and Marquess of Macduff, in the County of Banff, in the peerage of the United Kingdom.

The marriage of the Duke of Fife and Princess Louise produced three children:
* Alastair Duff (who would have been styled Marquess of Macduff, stillborn 16 June 1890);
* Lady Alexandra Duff (later styled &quot;H.H. Princess Alexandra&quot;, 17 May 1891 – 26 February 1959) married her first cousin once removed Prince Arthur of Connaught (13 January 1883 – 12 September 1938), and had one son, Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; and
* Lady Maud Duff (later styled &quot;H.H Princess Maud&quot;, 3 April 1893 – 14 December 1945) married the 11th Earl of Southesk, and had one son, James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife.

==Death and funeral==
In December 1911, while sailing to Egypt on the SS &quot;Delhi&quot;, the Duke and his family were shipwrecked off the coast of Morocco. They spent some time in the water before being rescued and then had to walk four miles to find accommodation. Although they all survived, the Duke fell ill with pleurisy, probably contracted as a result of the shipwreck.

He died at Aswan in Egypt on 29 January 1912, and his elder daughter, Princess Alexandra, succeeded to the dukedom of 1900, becoming Duchess of Fife and Countess of Macduff. His other titles, including the dukedom created in 1889, all became extinct. 

On his death his estate was valued for probate purposes at £1 million, an amount equivalent to £79.7 million in 2022. He held 249,000 acres.

The Duke&#x27;s body was brought home to Great Britain by sea, in a lead
coffin. It rested in the Royal Vault below St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, from 28 February 1912 until 6 August 1912, when it was transferred to Scotland for burial in St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel at Mar Lodge, Braemar, Aberdeenshire. The &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; reported:

==Honours==
The Duke of Fife received a new patent as Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in April 1900, with special remainder to his daughters by Princess Louise and their heirs male. The result was that he held two dukedoms of Fife; the 1889 creation (with the subsidiary Marquessate of Macduff) would become extinct in the absence of a son and the 1900 creation (with the subsidiary Earldom of Macduff) would devolve upon his elder daughter in the absence of a son. In November 1905, his father-in-law, now King Edward VII, bestowed the title Princess Royal on the Duchess of Fife and declared that Lady Alexandra Duff and Lady Maud Duff should henceforth hold the title of Princess of Great Britain and Ireland with the style Highness.

Queen Victoria created the future Duke of Fife a Knight of the Thistle; George V created him an Extra Knight of the Garter. He was also sworn a Privy Counsellor in 1880. At the coronation of his father-in-law, King Edward VII, in August 1902, and again at his brother-in-law King George V&#x27;s coronation in June 1911, the Duke of Fife acted as Lord High Constable. In addition to his London residence, 15 Portman Square, the Duke owned two estates in Scotland: Mar Lodge, Aberdeenshire, and Mountcoffer House, Banff.

<doc id="322380" wikidata="Q6209168" url="?curid=322380" title="Joe Conason">
<text>Joe Conason (born January 25, 1954) is an American journalist, author and liberal political commentator. He is the founder and editor-in-chief of The National Memo, a daily political newsletter and website that features breaking news and commentary. 

Conason was formerly the executive editor of the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, where he wrote a popular political column for almost 20 years. He was also a columnist for Salon.com from 1998 to 2010. His articles have appeared in dozens of publications around the world including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;Harpers&quot;. A winner of the New York Press Club&#x27;s Byline Award, Conason has covered every American presidential election since 1980.

Conason&#x27;s books include &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; (2000) and &quot;Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How It Distorts the Truth&quot; (2003). His &quot;Man of the World&quot; (2016) focuses on the post-presidency of Bill Clinton. &quot;The Longest Con: How Grifters, Swindlers, and Frauds Hijacked American Conservatism&quot; (2024), chiefly criticizing Donald Trump, exposes fraudsters and charlatans within the ranks of American conservatism and the religious right.

==Early life==
Conason was born in New York City and grew up in White Plains, New York. The family&#x27;s surname was originally &quot;Cohen&quot;. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Joseph Jacob Cohen, an organizer and journalist of the American anarchist movement during the 1920s and 1930s. Conason&#x27;s parents, Eleanor (née Levinson; August 20, 1917 – January 5, 2002) and Emanuel Voltaire Conason (1912–2008), co-owned Ellie Conason, a contemporary design and crafts store in White Plains.

Conason earned a degree in history from Brandeis University in 1975. 

==Career==
After college, Conason was appointed co-editor of the &quot;East Boston Community News&quot; and then he joined the staff of &quot;The Real Paper&quot;, an alternative weekly based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He covered environmental, racial, and political issues for both publications.

From 1978 to 1990, Conason worked as a columnist, staff writer, and national correspondent for the counter-cultural &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in New York City where he made a name for himself as an experienced and skilled reporter as well as a sharp commentator. His investigative reporting in 1985 exposed the hidden Manhattan real estate holdings of President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos (and his wife, Imelda), thereby helping to topple their dictatorial government.

During 1986–87, Conason traveled repeatedly to the Philippines to write about politics there. In 1989, he arrived in Beijing the night after the Tiananmen Square massacre and reported on the tragic aftermath for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. After leaving &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in the early 1990s, Conason served as editor-at-large for the Condé Nast&#x27;s &quot;Details&quot; magazine, which focused on lifestyle, political, and social issues.

For almost two decades (from 1992 to 2010), Conason served as a columnist, political editor, executive editor, and national correspondent for the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, a weekly publication whose founder, Arthur Carter, had previously been associated with &quot;The Nation.&quot;

During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Conason&#x27;s investigative reporting on Whitewater brought him national media attention, and he was a frequent cable television guest during Bill Clinton&#x27;s impeachment trial from 1998 to 1999. During this time, he wrote about the &quot;Arkansas Project&quot;, a secret, multi-million-dollar plan funded by conservative Pittsburgh billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife to find (or invent) negative material about the Clintons. 

In 2004, Conason was one of the first journalists to delve into the background and finances of the group known as the &quot;Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&quot;, which had targeted Democratic presidential nominee and Vietnam veteran John Kerry. Since 2006, he has served as editor of The Investigative Fund, a nonprofit journalism center.

In July 2011, Conason founded a daily political newsletter called &quot;The National Memo&quot; to try &quot;to bring to readers a very sharp take on the day&#x27;s news, a fair amount of original news, and aggregation.&quot; According to &quot;The National Memo&quot;, it aims to combine &quot;the spirit of investigative journalism with new technology and ideas.&quot; They cover various political related stories including campaigns, elections, the White House and presidency, Congress, and beyond.

==Writing==
In 1992, Conason wrote an article for &quot;Spy Magazine&quot; that claimed then President of the United States George H. W. Bush had cheated on his wife, Barbara. Conason explained in a later &quot;Salon&quot; article, &quot;I examined the rumors and allegations — and knocked down most of them. Yes, I quoted many anonymous sources on the subject. But I also quoted Washington journalists Jack Germond, Fred Barnes and the great Walter Pincus — along with the president&#x27;s son George W. — denying any substance to such allegations ... If I have any qualms about the Bush story, they&#x27;re the same ones that I felt at the time. The headline — &#x27;He cheats on his wife&#x27; — oversold what we were publishing, as I told [&quot;Spy&quot; editors Kurt] Andersen and [Susan] Morrison. They disagreed. And the &quot;Spy&quot; style tended to preface allegations with the word &quot;alleged&quot; less diligently than other publications.&quot;

In February 2000, Conason published an investigative profile of George W. Bush in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; Magazine that examined his business career in Texas and how his former business partners potentially profited from state investments after Bush became governor. This story was revived in 2002, early in Bush&#x27;s presidency, when his ties to Harken Energy came under scrutiny.

Along with Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, Conason is the co-author of &quot;The Hunting of the President: The 10 Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 2001) with Arkansas journalist, Gene Lyons. The book focuses on what he describes as a &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy&quot; to bring down Bill Clinton—a term initially used by Hillary Clinton in defending her husband against accusations during his ultimately successful 1992 presidential bid—by identifying the main participants, revealing their tactics, tracing the millions of dollars spent on their efforts, and examining how (and why) mainstream news organizations helped those determined to bring down the Clintons. The book, a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, was later turned into a documentary in 2004, which Conason co-produced.

Conason&#x27;s next endeavor, &quot;Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How It Distorts the Truth&quot;, addresses what he labels right-wing bias and purporting to debunk ten lies he claims are perpetrated by conservative propaganda. This was Conason&#x27;s second &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling book.

Conason profiled Bill Clinton for &quot;Esquire&quot; in December 2005, after traveling to Africa with the former president and covering the inaugural conference of the Clinton Global Initiative. The cover story, titled &quot;The Third Term: The Dawning of a Different Sort of Post-Presidency&quot;, was later included in Best American Political Writing of 2006, published by Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press.

&quot;The Raw Deal: How the Bush Republicans Plan to Destroy Social Security and the Legacy of the New Deal&quot;, about what Conason claims was the Bush administration&#x27;s efforts to &quot;end Social Security as we know it&quot;, appeared in 2005 with a preface by Al Franken, another liberal writer who later served as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota.

Following &quot;The Raw Deal&quot; and &quot;Big Lies&quot;, Conason wrote &quot;It Can Happen Here: Authoritarian Peril in the Age of Bush&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, January 2008). The title comes from Sinclair Lewis&#x27; 1935 novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, which portrays an American dictatorship. In this book, Conason discusses what he views as a move towards authoritarianism during the administration of George W. Bush.

During the 2016 United States presidential election campaign, Conason and Gene Lyons published a free e-book called &quot;The Hunting of Hillary&quot;, which was primarily based on their previous book, &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot;. The e-book reviews more than twenty years of alleged Clinton scandals including Whitewater with a particular focus on Hillary Clinton.

In September 2016, Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton&quot;, Conason&#x27;s account of the 42nd president&#x27;s post-presidency. Conason interviewed Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton and many of Clinton&#x27;s friends, aides, rivals and supporters to offer a comprehensive analysis of Clinton&#x27;s post-presidency.

=== &quot;The Longest Con: How Grifters, Swindler and Frauds Hijacked American Conservatism (2024)&quot; ===
In 2024, Conason published &quot;The Longest Con: How Grifters, Swindlers, and Frauds Hijacked American Conservatism&quot;, which chiefly criticizes Donald Trump, exposes fraudsters and charlatans within the ranks of American conservatism and the religious right dating back to Joseph McCarthy. NBC and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; recommended it as important reading for understanding politics in 2024.

==Public appearances==
Conason is a frequent guest on radio and television including MSNBC and CNN.

==Personal life==
In October 2002, Conason married Elizabeth Horan Wagley, then the development director of the U.S. branch of Médecins du Monde. They have two children, Edward and Eleanor, and currently reside in New York City.

<doc id="322383" wikidata="Q7313911" url="?curid=322383" title="Reparations for slavery in the United States">
<text>Reparations for slavery is the application of the concept of reparations to victims of slavery or their descendants. There are concepts for reparations in legal philosophy and reparations in transitional justice. In the US, reparations for slavery have been both given by legal ruling in court and/or given voluntarily (without court rulings) by individuals and institutions.

The first recorded case of reparations for slavery in the United States was to former slave Belinda Royall in 1783, in the form of a pension, and since then reparations continue to be proposed. To the present day, no federal reparations bills have been passed. The 1865 Special Field Orders No. 15 (&quot;Forty acres and a mule&quot;) is the most well known attempt to help newly freed slaves integrate into society and accumulate wealth. However, President Andrew Johnson reversed this order, giving the land back to its former Confederate owners.

Reparations have been a recurring idea in the politics of the United States, most recently in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The call for reparations intensified in 2020, amidst the protests against police brutality and the COVID-19 pandemic, which both kill Black Americans disproportionately. Calls for reparations for racism and discrimination in the US are often made by black communities and authors alongside calls for reparations for slavery. The idea of reparations remains highly controversial, due to questions of how they would be given, how much would be given, who would pay them, and who would receive them.

Forms of reparations which have been proposed in the United States by city, county, state, and national governments or private institutions include: individual monetary payments, settlements, scholarships, waiving of fees, and systemic initiatives to offset injustices, land-based compensation related to independence, apologies and acknowledgements of the injustices, token measures (such as naming a building after someone), and the removal of monuments and streets named to slave owners and defenders of slavery.

Since further injustices and discrimination have continued since slavery was outlawed in the US, some black communities and civil rights organizations have called for reparations for those injustices as well as for reparations directly related to slavery. Some suggest that the U.S. prison system, starting with the convict lease system and continuing through the present-day government-owned corporation Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR), is a modern form of legal slavery that still primarily and disproportionately affects black populations and other minorities via the war on drugs and what has been criticized as a school-to-prison pipeline.

==U.S. historical context==
===In colonial times===
The debate on reparations reaches as far back as the eighteenth century. Quakers, who were some of the first abolitionists in the United States, almost unanimously insisted that freed slaves were entitled to compensation from their former owners. If an owner repented of his sin of owning a chattel slave, he needs to atone for it by making amends. Quakers cited the book of Deuteronomy, in which owners were exhorted to share their goods with former slaves.

During the Revolutionary War, Warner Mifflin advocated for restitution for freed ex-slaves as early as 1778, in the form of cash payments, land, and shared crop arrangements. Gary B. Nash writes that, &quot;he may fairly be called the father of American reparationism&quot;.

===Before the Civil War===
Well before slavery was abolished nationally in 1865, abolitionists presented suggestions on what could or should be done to compensate the enslaved workers after their liberation.

Early in 1859, in a book dedicated to &quot;Old Hero&quot; John Brown, James Redpath declared himself a &quot;reparationist&quot;, and implies that in his view, the lands of the Confederacy should be given to the ex-slaves. He also quotes an earlier poem, by William North, that refers to &quot;the course of reparation&quot;.

Later that year, after Brown&#x27;s execution, Redpath reported in the first biography of Brown that he &quot;was not merely an emancipationist, but a reparationist. He believed, not only that the crime of slavery should be abolished, but that reparation should be made for the wrongs that had been done to the slave. What he believed, he practiced. On this occasion [Missouri raid, 1859], after telling the slaves that they were free, he asked them how much their services had been worth, and—having been answered—proceeded to take property to the amount thus due to the negroes.&quot;

Calls for permanent confiscation and redistribution of plantation lands had already been made by Representatives George W. Julian and Thaddeus Stevens, both of the Radical Republican faction.

===The Reconstruction period===
The arguments surrounding reparations are based on the formal discussion about many different reparations, and actual land reparations received by African Americans which were later taken away. In 1865, after the Confederate States of America were defeated in the American Civil War, General William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Orders, No. 15 to both &quot;assure the harmony of action in the area of operations&quot; and to solve problems caused by the masses of freed slaves, a temporary plan granting each freed family forty acres of tillable land in the sea islands and around Charleston, South Carolina for the exclusive use of black people who had been enslaved. The army also had a number of unneeded mules which were given to freed slaves. Around 40,000 freed slaves were settled on 400,000 acres (1,600 km2) in Georgia and South Carolina. However, President Andrew Johnson reversed the order after Lincoln was assassinated, the land was returned to its previous owners, and the blacks were forced to leave. In 1867, Thaddeus Stevens sponsored a bill for the redistribution of land to African Americans, but it did not pass.

Reconstruction came to an end in 1877 without the issue of reparations having been addressed. Thereafter, a deliberate movement of segregation and oppression arose in Southern states. Jim Crow laws passed in some Southeastern states to reinforce the existing inequality that slavery had produced. In addition, white extremist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan engaged in a massive campaign of terrorism throughout the Southeast in order to keep African Americans in their prescribed social place. For decades this assumed inequality and injustice was ruled on in court decisions and debated in public discourse.

In one anomalous case, a former slave named Henrietta Wood successfully sued for compensation after having been kidnapped from the free state of Ohio and sold into slavery in Mississippi. After the American Civil War, she was freed and returned to Cincinnati, where she won her case in federal court in 1878, receiving $2,500 (~$ in ) in damages. Though the verdict was a national news story, it did not prompt any trend toward additional similar cases.

===Post-Reconstruction Era===

In 1896, the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association (MRB&amp;PA) was founded for the purpose of obtaining pensions for former slaves from the Federal government as compensation and reparations for their unpaid labor and suffering. Chartered in 1898 in Nashville, Tennessee, the organization was founded by former slaves Callie House and Isaiah H. Dickerson. According to some historians, the organization was &quot;the first mass reparations movement led by African Americans.&quot; The organization and its leaders were hounded with false allegations and criminal prosecutions until its last local branches closed in the 1930&#x27;s.

In 1915, under Callie House&#x27;s leadership, the association filed a class-action lawsuit, Johnson v. McAdoo, in federal court against the U.S. Treasury Department for 68 million dollars. $68 million was the amount of cotton tax collected between 1862 and 1868 and, it was argued, was due to the plaintiffs because this cotton had been produced by them and their ancestors as a result of their involuntary servitude. This was the first documented Black reparations litigation in the US on the federal level. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied the claim based on governmental immunity as did the U.S. Supreme Court, siding with the Appeals Court&#x27;s decision.

===2020===
The topic became a prominent theme during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries as concerns surrounding race were heightened due to current events. It was further amplified because of African-American people were dying prematurely and disproportionately due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing systemic racism and police brutality also sparked outrage across the country, notably the killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old African-American emergency medical technician, fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department in her home; the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, shot while out for a run by three white men in Georgia; and the murder of George Floyd, a Black American killed during an arrest by Minneapolis police after allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill, that sparked the nationwide George Floyd protests.

Candidates that endorsed the idea included:
* Andrew Yang said that he supports H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, while speaking on the Karen Hunter show.
* Marianne Williamson detailed a plan for reparations in an interview for Ebony Magazine.
* Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have both indicated some level of support for reparations, according to NPR.
* Tulsi Gabbard is a cosponsor of H.R. 40, the only piece of legislation in Congress to study and develop reparations proposals and Bernie Sanders is a co-sponsor for the Senate version of the bill.

Kamala Harris declared in April 2019 she supports reparations.

Beto O&#x27;Rourke is &quot;open to considering some form of reparations,&quot; according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

Tom Steyer in the 2020 Democratic Primaries Debate in South Carolina voiced his support for reparations.

==Proposals for reparations==
===United States government===

Some proposals have called for direct payments from the U.S. government. Various estimates have been given if such payments were to be made. &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; estimated that the total of reparations due was about &quot;$97 trillion, based on 222,505,049 hours of forced labor between 1619 and 1865, regardless the United States wasn&#x27;t a recognized independent country until after the Revolutionary War in 1787, compounded at 6% interest through 1993&quot;. Should all or part of this amount be paid to the descendants of slaves in the United States, the current U.S. government would only pay a fraction of that cost, since it has been in existence only since 1789. For two centuries, from the 1700s until World War I, the average wage for one day&#x27;s unskilled labor in America was one dollar.

According to the Brookings Institution, in 1860, over $3 billion (~$ in ) was the value assigned to the physical bodies of enslaved Black Americans to be used as free labor and production. This was more money than was invested in factories and railroads combined. In 1861, the value placed on cotton produced by enslaved Blacks was $250 million (~$ in ). For the descendants of the 12.5 million Blacks who were shipped in chains from Western Africa, “America has a genetic birth defect when it comes to the question of race,” as stated recently by U.S. representative Hakeem Jeffries. If America is to atone for this defect, reparations for Black Americans is part of the healing and reconciliation process.

The Rev. M.J. Divine, better known as Father Divine, was one of the earliest leaders to argue clearly for &quot;retroactive compensation&quot;, and the message was spread via International Peace Mission publications. On July 28, 1951, Father Divine issued a &quot;peace stamp&quot; bearing the text: &quot;Peace! All nations and peoples who have suppressed and oppressed the under-privileged, they will be obliged to pay the African slaves and their descendants for all uncompensated servitude and for all unjust compensation, whereby they have been unjustly deprived of compensation on the account of previous condition of servitude and the present condition of servitude. This is to be accomplished in the defense of all other under-privileged subjects and must be paid retroactive up-to-date&quot;.

At the first National Reparations Convention in Chicago in 2001, a proposal by Howshua Amariel, a Chicago social activist, would require the federal government to make reparations to proven descendants of slaves. In addition, Amariel stated &quot;For those blacks who wish to remain in America, they should receive reparations in the form of free education, free medical, free legal and free financial aid for 50 years with no taxes levied,&quot; and &quot;For those desiring to leave America, every black person would receive a million dollars or more, backed by gold, in reparation.&quot; At the convention Amariel&#x27;s proposal received approval from the 100 or so participants. Nevertheless, the question of who would receive such payments, who should pay them and in what amount, has remained highly controversial, since the United States Census does not track descent from slaves or slave owners and relies on self-reported racial categories.

On July 30, 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution apologizing for American slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws.

Nine states have officially apologized for their involvement in the enslavement of Africans. Those states are:
* Alabama – April 25, 2007
* Connecticut
* Delaware – February 11, 2016
* Florida – 2008
* Maryland – 2007
* New Jersey – 2008
* North Carolina – 2007
* Tennessee
* Virginia – 2007

===Private institutions===
Private institutions and corporations were also involved in slavery. On March 8, 2000, Reuters News Service reported that Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, a law school graduate, initiated a one-woman campaign making a historic demand for restitution and apologies from modern companies that played a direct role in enslaving Africans. Aetna Inc. was her first target because of their practice of writing life insurance policies on the lives of enslaved Africans with slave owners as the beneficiaries. In response to Farmer-Paellmann&#x27;s demand, Aetna Inc. issued a public apology, and the &quot;corporate restitution movement&quot; was born.

By 2002, nine lawsuits were filed around the country coordinated by Farmer-Paellmann and the Restitution Study Group—a New York non-profit. The litigation included 20 plaintiffs, demanding restitution from 20 companies from the banking, insurance, textile, railroad, and tobacco industries. The cases were consolidated under 28 U.S.C. 1407 to multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The district court dismissed the lawsuits &quot;with&quot; prejudice, and the claimants appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

On December 13, 2006, that court, in an opinion written by Judge Richard Posner, modified the district court&#x27;s judgment to be a dismissal &quot;without&quot; prejudice, affirmed the majority of the district court&#x27;s judgment, and reversed the portion of the district court&#x27;s judgment dismissing the plaintiffs&#x27; consumer protection claims, remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. Thus, the plaintiffs may bring the lawsuit again, but must clear considerable procedural and substantive hurdles first:
If one or more of the defendants violated a state law by transporting slaves in 1850, and the plaintiffs can establish standing to sue, prove the violation despite its antiquity, establish that the law was intended to provide a remedy (either directly or by providing the basis for a common law action for conspiracy, conversion, or restitution) to lawfully enslaved persons or their descendants, identify their ancestors, quantify damages incurred, and persuade the court to toll the statute of limitations, there would be no further obstacle to the grant of relief.

In October 2000, California passed the Slavery Era Disclosure Law requiring insurance companies doing business there to report on their role in slavery. The disclosure legislation, introduced by Senator Tom Hayden, is the prototype for similar laws passed in 12 states around the United States.

The NAACP has called for more of such legislation at local and corporate levels. It quotes Dennis C. Hayes, CEO of the NAACP, as saying, &quot;Absolutely, we will be pursuing reparations from companies that have historical ties to slavery and engaging all parties to come to the table.&quot; Brown University, whose namesake family was involved in the slave trade, has also established a committee to explore the issue of reparations. In February 2007, Brown University announced a set of responses to its Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice. While in 1995 the Southern Baptist Convention apologized for the &quot;sins&quot; of racism, including slavery.

In December 2005, a boycott was called by a coalition of reparations groups under the sponsorship of the Restitution Study Group. The boycott targets the student loan products of banks deemed complicit in slavery—particularly those identified in the Farmer-Paellmann litigation. As part of the boycott, students are asked to choose from other banks to finance their student loans.

Pro-reparations groups such as the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America advocate for compensation to be in the form of community rehabilitation and not payments to individual descendants.

=== Black Lives Matter ===
Many groups under the Black Lives Matter organization have laid out a list of demands, some of which include: reparations, for what they say are past and continuing harms to African Americans, an end to the death penalty, legislation to acknowledge the effects of slavery, a move to defund the police, seizing homes owned by white families and providing them free to blacks, as well as investments in education initiatives, mental health services, and jobs programs. These calls for reparations have been bolstered amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the high rates of police brutality against Blacks.

==Arguments for reparations==

=== Accumulated wealth ===
Housing discrimination played a big role in creating the racial wealth gap that exists today. After the Great Migration of Southern blacks to Chicago in the 1940s, redlining was used to keep former slaves segregated from whites and to prevent black families from getting a mortgage. Thus they were forced to buy houses on contracts from real estate speculators, which were a scam. Not only did this cause thousands of Black Americans to lose their homes and their money, it also created what are known today as ghettos and prevented Blacks from accumulating wealth. According to the 45th president, Donald Trump, states may designate up to 25% of low-income census tracts as Opportunity Zones. Opportunity Zones were created under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump. The first Opportunity Zones were designated in April 2018. Today, the average white family has roughly 10 times the amount of wealth as the average black family, and white college graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college graduates.

The wealth of the United States was greatly enhanced by the exploitation of African-American slave labor: some argue it is the bedrock for the U.S. economy and capitalism. However, former slaves and their descendants are among the poorest demographic in America. According to this view, reparations would be valuable primarily as a way of correcting modern economic imbalances.

In 2008 the American Humanist Association published an article which argued that if emancipated slaves had been allowed to possess and retain the profits of their labor, their descendants might now control a much larger share of American social and monetary wealth. Not only did the freedmen not receive a share of these profits, but they were stripped of the small amounts of compensation paid to some of them during Reconstruction. Therefore, many scholars and activists call for reparations to eliminate &quot;racial disparities in wealth, income, education, health, sentencing and incarceration, political participation, and subsequent opportunities to engage in American political and social life&quot;.

In 2019, VICE magazine published an article that argued racial health disparities, from slavery through Jim Crow until today, have cost Black Americans a significant amount of money in health care expenses and lost wages, and should be paid back. Ray and Perry state in a Brookings article that the lack of a social safety net and the wealth gap are particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. They explain that “disparities in access to health care along with inequities in economic policies combine,” making this inequality a life or death situation for black Americans.

=== Current discrimination ===
Many argue that giving reparations for slavery is too complicated, but there is a strong basis for them on the past and current discrimination that blacks in America face. Ta-Nehisi Coates explains it in &quot;The Case for Reparations&quot; article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as &quot;ninety years of Jim Crow, sixty years of separate but equal, and thirty-five years of racist housing policy&quot;. The legacy of these policies have kept African Americans from opportunities to build wealth, while slavery &quot;enriched white slave owners and their descendants&quot;. Today, the district of North Lawndale in Chicago, where redlining was the strongest, is the poorest neighborhood in the city, with an unemployment rate of 18.6% and 42% of residents living below the poverty line.

The discriminatory practices of 1940 through 1970 still reverberate today, as the average White family has roughly ten times the amount of wealth as the average Black family. As Bittker claims in his book &quot;The Case for Black Reparations&quot;, &quot;as slavery faded into the background, it was succeeded by a caste system embodying white supremacy&quot;. Many argue that while reparations may be a first step towards amending the harms caused by slavery, the systemic racism that exists in many institutions will not be fixed as easily. Malcolm X stated: &quot;If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there&#x27;s no progress. If you pull it all the way out that&#x27;s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made.&quot;

===Precedents===

Advocates have used other examples of reparations to argue that victims of institutional slavery should be similarly compensated.

In several cases the federal government has formally apologized to or compensated minority groups for past actions:
* Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, the U.S. government apologized for Japanese American internment during World War II and provided reparations of $20,000 to each survivor, to compensate for loss of property and liberty during that period. No compensation was given to the descendants of affected individuals though.
* The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act transferred land, federal money, and a portion of oil revenues to native Alaskans.
* The Apology Resolution of 1993 apologized for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, but gave no compensation.

U.S. state governments have made reparations in some specific circumstances:
* Virginia established a compensation fund for victims of involuntary sterilization in 2015.

Other countries have also opted to pay reparations for past grievances, such as:
* Reparations for the Holocaust, including the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany and various programs under the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.

==Arguments against reparations==

===Statute of limitations===

Most state and federal laws under which parties can sue for damages have a statute of limitations which sets a deadline for filing; these have all long since passed, which prevents courts from granting relief under existing laws. This has been used effectively in several suits, including &quot;In re: African American Slave Descendants&quot;, which dismissed a high-profile suit against a number of businesses with ties to slavery.

=== Technical complications ===
The technical side of reparations is very complex, and could be a reason why they have not yet been implemented. Some argue against the idea of putting a monetary value on the traumas that Black Americans have faced, dubbing it &quot;transactionalism&quot;. On the other hand, some dismiss the case for reparations entirely due to practical concerns, such as who would receive these financial payments, why should the current generation pay for wrongs for which they are not responsible, and how much should be paid.

The estimates of the monetary value of stolen slave labor and subsequent discrimination vary “from an outrageously low $3.2 million to $4.7 billion,” and to as much as $12 trillion. This also raises the question of who is responsible for paying. Generally, three actors are agreed upon: federal and state governments, who supported and protected the institution of slavery; private companies that benefited from it; and “rich families that owe a good portion of their wealth to slavery”.

Some claim that closing the wealth gap involves paying descendants of slaves “individual cash payments in the amount that will close the Black-white racial wealth divide”. Another suggestion is for reparations to &quot;come in the form of wealth-building opportunities that address racial disparities in education, housing, and business ownership&quot;. For example, in the city of Asheville, North Carolina, reparations have been implemented in the form of &quot;investments in areas where Black residents face disparities&quot;. However, the complications that surround this are significant, and others argue that putting the money into communities is not efficient, due to people moving and gentrification.

In his book, Bittker lays out some of the practical and constitutional problems that would likely arise in an attempt to execute a program of reparations to Blacks. Would it be the same payment to every person? Would they have to prove ancestry to an African slave, or would it be any black person who was subject to racism? There are no real answers to these questions, as this is an unprecedented case. Other cases of reparations, such as to the Jewish people who survived the Holocaust or the Native Americans in the United States, are very different in the way that it is much easier to identify the group who should receive them, and the reparations were paid more quickly than in the case of reparations for slavery.

===Additional arguments and opinions===

Steven Greenhut, the western region director for the R Street Institute, has suggested that reparations would make racism worse.

Republican senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is a descendant of slave owners, while acknowledging that slavery was an &quot;original sin&quot; of the United States, opposes providing reparations because he believes &quot;none of us currently living are responsible.&quot;

One publication against reparations is David Horowitz, &quot;Uncivil Wars: The Controversy Over Reparations for Slavery&quot; (2002). Other works that discuss problems with reparations include John Torpey&#x27;s &quot;Making Whole What Has Been Smashed: On Reparations Politics&quot; (2006), Alfred Brophy&#x27;s &quot;Reparations Pro and Con&quot; (2006), and Nahshon Perez&#x27;s &quot;Freedom from Past Injustices&quot; (Edinburgh University Press, 2012).

Reparations in the U.S. have never gained widespread public support. Often in these conversations, the White reaction is to claim that this is a form of unjustifiable &quot;reverse racism&quot;, or that demands for reparations are an example of the &quot;Black refusal to move beyond the memory of slavery&quot;. A 2020 poll from The Washington Post showed that &quot;63% of Americans don&#x27;t think the U.S. should pay reparations to the descendants of slaves&quot;. Notably, 82% of Black Americans support reparations, while 75% of White Americans do not. Some arguments also highlight the complications behind reparations, such as &quot;not all Black Americans are descendants of slaves&quot; or that the people alive today are not responsible for the harms of slavery. Others still argue that reparations will do nothing in the face of racism, and that structural and policy changes would be more effective. In the midst of America&#x27;s racial unrest from 2020 to the present, these tensions were particularly exposed.

== Reparations and COVID-19 ==
The call for reparations has amplified due to the coronavirus pandemic, with people of color disproportionately likely to be laid off, to struggle financially, and to die from the virus. For example, 40% of black-owned businesses have closed permanently since March due to the pandemic, compared to 17% of white-owned businesses during the same period. This relates back to the fact that white families have roughly ten times the wealth of black families. This limits black-owned businesses&#x27; access to credit and loans, and they do not have the safety net in times of crises that many white-owned businesses do.

In addition, African Americans continue to get infected and die from COVID-19 at rates more than 1.5 times their share of the population. In August 2020, the CDC released data showing that Blacks, Latinos, and American Indians are experiencing hospitalizations at rates 4.5 to 5.5 times higher than non-Hispanic whites, and that African Americans are dying at 2.4 times the white rate.

== Legislation and other actions ==

===Federal government===

* Virginia – Apologized for its involvement in the enslavement of Africans on February 26, 2007.

===Counties===
* Buncombe County, North Carolina: On June 16, 2020, in a 7–0 vote, Buncombe County Commissioners decided to remove several Confederate monuments including the Vance Monument which is named after North Carolina governor Zeb Vance, a slave owner who used convict labor to build the railroad to Western North Carolina. Significant community involvement led to the decision. Leading up to the vote, the board received 549 supporting messages and 19 opposing.

===Cities===
* Chicago, Illinois: &quot;In 2015, Chicago enacted a reparations ordinance covering hundreds of African Americans tortured by police from the 1970s to the 1990s. The law calls for $5.5 million in financial compensation, as well as hundreds of thousands more for a public memorial, and a range of assistance related to health, education and emotional well-being.&quot;
* Evanston, Illinois: &quot;The City Council of Evanston, Illinois, voted to allocate the first $10 million in tax revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana (which became legal in the state on January 1, 2020) to fund reparations initiatives that address the gaps in wealth and opportunity of black residents.&quot;
* Asheville, North Carolina: The city council approved reparations on a 7–0 vote on July 14, 2020. &quot;[B]udgetary and programmatic priorities may include but not be limited to increasing minority home ownership and access to other affordable housing, increasing minority business ownership and career opportunities, strategies to grow equity and generational wealth, closing the gaps in health care, education, employment and pay, neighborhood safety and fairness within criminal justice,&quot; the resolution reads. The resolution establishes the Community Reparations Commission which will make concrete recommendations for programs and resources allocations to ultimately carry out the reparations. The Asheville City Council also voted unanimously on June 9, 2020, to remove two confederate monuments as a result of demands made by a group called &quot;Black Asheville Demands&quot; and the work of the Racial Justice Coalition with led the push for the effort. The city council meeting had so much community engagement public comment was extended for an extra hour beyond the normal meeting time.
* San Francisco, California: In March 2023, &quot;reparation payments of $5 million to eligible Black residents [were] unanimously accepted by San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors.&quot;

===Organizations and institutions===
* Aetna: Apologized in 2000 for issuing life insurance policies to enslavers covering the lives of enslaved people from . In 2002, when Farmer-Paellman brought suit against Aetna, CSX and Fleet for unjust enrichment by &quot;a system that enslaved, tortured, starved and exploited human beings,&quot; this suit was dismissed.
* University of Alabama: Apologized for the history of slavery at the university in 2004.
* Wachovia: Apologized for its connection to slavery in 2005.
* JP Morgan Chase: Apologized for its connection to slavery in 2005.
* Georgetown University: &quot;In 2016 [the university agreed] to give admissions preference to descendants of the 272 slaves[,] formally apologized for its role in slavery [and] [renamed] two buildings on its campus to acknowledge the lives of enslaved people&quot;. In April, 2019 students at Georgetown University voted to increase their tuition by $27.20 to benefit the descendants of the 272 slaves sold by the Jesuits who ran the school in 1838. The student-led referendum was non-binding. Later that year, after further pressure and follow up from the Georgetown University Student Association, the university eventually moved forward with a similar proposal without the students&#x27; covering the cost with a tuition increase.
* Princeton Theological Seminary: In 2019 the Seminary announced a $27 million commitment for various initiatives to recognize how it benefited from black slavery. This is the largest monetary commitment by an educational institution.
* Virginia Theological Seminary: Set aside $1.7 million to pay reparations to descendants of African Americans who were enslaved to work on their campus, first distributed in 2021.

<text>The &quot;Boyd&quot; massacre occurred in December 1809 when Māori of Ngāti Pou from Whangaroa Harbour in northern New Zealand killed and ate between 66 and 70 European crew members from the British brigantine &quot;Boyd&quot;. This was the highest number of Europeans killed by Māori in a single event in New Zealand. 

The Māori attack was in retaliation for the whipping of their rangatira or chief of Ngāti Pou, Te Ara, on his voyage back from Sydney Cove, New South Wales aboard the &quot;Boyd&quot;. Te Ara had been wrongly accused of onboard theft and was punished with a cat o&#x27; nine tails. According to another version, he was the son of a chief and had been punished because he had refused to pay for his passage on the ship by working as a seaman. Local people were already tense and inflamed after a previous ship had brought disease to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/36720&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the &quot;Boyd&quot; moored at Whangaroa, the Māori launched a night attack, killing the crew. After capturing the ship, the passengers were taken on deck where they were killed and dismembered. A few Europeans managed to hide and others were taken ashore, in a rescue attempt, by another Māori chief who had come to trade with the &quot;Boyd&quot;.

In March 1810, European whalers, in the mistaken belief that these Māori had ordered the killings, attacked the island pā of Chief Te Pahi of Ngāpuhi about 60 km south-east of Whangaroa in retribution for the &quot;Boyd&quot; killings. Between 16 and 60 Maori and one European died in the clash. News of the events delayed the first missionary visits to the country, and caused the number of shipping visits to fall to &quot;almost nothing&quot; over the next few years.

After the massacre, the Māori took the &quot;Boyd&quot; back to their village where they tried to extract the gunpowder from the barrels in the hold. The gunpowder ignited when a flint was struck burning the ship down to the waterline of its copper sheathing. The Māori declared the burnt-out hull tapu, sacred or prohibited. 

==Background==
&quot;Boyd&quot; was a 395-ton (bm) brigantine that had brought convicts to New South Wales and then in October 1809 sailed from Australia&#x27;s Sydney Cove to Whangaroa on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s Northland Peninsula to pick up kauri spars. The ship was under the command of Captain John Thompson and carried about 70 people.

The ship carried several passengers, including ex-convicts who had completed their transportation sentences and four or five New Zealanders who were returning to their homeland. Among the latter was Te Ara, or Tarrah, known to the crew as George, the son of a Māori chief from Whangaroa. Te Ara had spent more than a year on board different vessels that included a sealing expedition to islands in the Southern Ocean.

On the &quot;Boyd&quot; he was expected to work his passage on the ship. Some accounts state that he declined to do so because he was ill or because of his status as a chief&#x27;s son. Another account states that the ship&#x27;s cook accidentally threw some pewter spoons overboard and accused Te Ara of stealing them to avoid being flogged himself. Alexander Berry, in a letter describing the events, said: &quot;The captain had been rather too hasty in resenting some slight theft.&quot;

Whatever the reason, the result was that the captain deprived Te Ara of food and had him tied to a capstan and whipped with a cat-o&#x27;-nine-tails.

This treatment of Te Ara prompted him to seek &quot;utu&quot;, or revenge. Te Ara regained the confidence of the captain and persuaded him to put into Whangaroa Bay, assuring him that it was the best place to secure the timber he desired.

Upon reaching Whangaroa, Te Ara reported his indignities to his tribe and displayed the whip marks on his back. In accordance with Māori customs, the tribe formed a plan for &quot;utu&quot;. Under British law, whipping was the common punishment for minor crimes – a British person could be legally hanged for stealing goods to the value of five shillings. In Māori culture, however, the son of a chief was a privileged figure who did not bow to an outsider&#x27;s authority. Physical punishment of his son caused the chief to suffer a loss of face (or &quot;mana&quot;), and to Māori this warranted a violent retribution.

==Massacre==
===Killings===
Three days after &quot;Boyd&#x27;s&quot; arrival, the Māori invited Captain Thompson to follow their canoes to find suitable kauri trees. Thompson, his chief officer and three others followed the canoes to the entrance of the Kaeo River. The remaining crew stayed aboard with the passengers, preparing the vessel for the voyage to Britain.

When the boats were out of sight of &quot;Boyd&quot;, the Māori attacked the five pākehā (foreigners), killing them all with clubs and axes. The Māori stripped the clothes from the victims and a group donned them to disguise themselves as Europeans. Another group carried the bodies to their pā (village) to be eaten.

At dusk the disguised group manned the longboat, and at nightfall they slipped alongside the &quot;Boyd&quot; and were greeted by the crew. Other Māori canoes awaited the signal to attack. The first to die was an officer of the ship: the attackers then crept around the deck, stealthily killing all the crew. The passengers were called to the deck and then killed and dismembered. Five people hid up the mast among the rigging, where they witnessed the events.

===Survivors===

The next morning the survivors saw a large canoe carrying chief Te Pahi from the Bay of Islands enter the harbour. The chief had come to the area to trade with the Whangaroa Māori. The Europeans called out to Te Pahi&#x27;s canoe for help. After Te Pahi had gathered the survivors from the &quot;Boyd&quot;, they headed for shore, but two Whangaroa canoes pursued them. As the survivors fled along the beach, Te Pahi watched as the pursuers caught and killed all but one.

Five people were spared in the massacre: Ann Morley and her baby, in a cabin; apprentice Thomas Davis (or Davison), hidden in the hold; the second mate; and two-year-old Elizabeth &quot;Betsey&quot; Broughton, taken by a local chief who put a feather in her hair and kept her for three weeks before she was rescued. The second mate was initially forced to make fish-hooks, but his captors found his skill unsatisfactory, so they killed and ate him, too.

=== Wreck===
The Whangaroa Māori towed &quot;Boyd&quot; towards their village until it grounded on mudflats near Motu Wai (Red Island). They spent several days ransacking the ship, tossing flour, salt pork, and bottled wine overboard. 

When up to 20 Māori found a cache of muskets and gunpowder, they smashed barrels of gunpowder and attempted to make the muskets functional. Chief Piopio sparked a flint this was said to have ignited the gunpowder, causing a massive explosion that killed him and nine other Māori instantly. A fire then swept the ship igniting its cargo of whale oil. Soon all that was left of &quot;Boyd&quot; was a burnt-out sunken hull. Māori declared the hull tapu, sacred or prohibited.

==Rescue==
When news of the massacre reached European settlements, Captain Alexander Berry undertook a rescue mission aboard . Berry rescued the four remaining survivors: Ann Morley and her baby, Thomas Davis (or Davison), and Betsy Broughton.

The &quot;City of Edinburgh&quot; crew found piles of human bones on the shoreline, with many evincing cannibalism.

Captain Berry captured two Māori chiefs responsible for the massacre, at first holding them for ransom for the return of survivors. After the survivors were returned, Berry told the chiefs that they would be taken to Europe to answer for their crimes unless they released the &quot;Boyd&#x27;s&quot; papers. After the papers were given to him, he released the chiefs. He made it a condition of their release that they would be &quot;degraded from their rank, and received among the number of his slaves&quot;, although he never expected this condition to be complied with.
They expressed gratitude for the mercy. Berry&#x27;s gesture avoided further bloodshed, an inevitability had the chiefs been executed.

The four people rescued were taken on board Berry&#x27;s ship bound for the Cape of Good Hope. However, the ship encountered storms and was damaged, and after repairs arrived in Lima, Peru. Mrs Morley died while in Lima.
The boy, called Davis or Davison, went from Lima to England aboard the , and later worked for Berry in New South Wales. He drowned while exploring the entrance to the Shoalhaven River with Berry in 1822.
Mrs Morley&#x27;s child and Betsy Broughton were taken onwards by Berry to Rio de Janeiro, from where they returned to Sydney in May 1812 aboard .
Betsy Broughton married Charles Throsby, nephew of the explorer Charles Throsby, and died in 1891.

==Aftermath==
In March 1810, sailors from five whaling ships (, &quot;Diana&quot;, &quot;Experiment&quot;, &quot;Perseverance&quot;, &quot;Speke&quot;, and ) launched a revenge attack. Their target was the pa on Motu Apo island in Wairoa Bay belonging to Te Pahi, the chief who tried to rescue the &quot;Boyd&quot; survivors and then saw them killed. Te Pahi had later accepted one of the &quot;Boyd&#x27;s&quot; small boats and some other booty, and his name was confused with that of Te Puhi, who was one of the plotters of the massacre. This was the belief of Samuel Marsden, the prominent early missionary who said it was Te Ara (George) and his brother Te Puhi who took &quot;Boyd&quot; as revenge. In the attack between 16 and 60 Māori and one sailor were killed.

Te Pahi, who was wounded in the neck and chest, realised that the sailors had attacked him because of the actions of the Whangaroa Maori. Some time before 28 April, he gathered his remaining warriors and attacked Whangaroa, where he was killed by a spear thrust.

News of the Boyd Massacre reached Australia and Europe, delaying a planned visit of missionaries until 1814. A notice was printed and circulated in Europe advising against visiting &quot;that cursed shore&quot; of New Zealand, at the risk of being eaten by cannibals.

Shipping to New Zealand &quot;fell away to almost nothing&quot; during the next three years.

<text>Robert David Sanders Novak (February 26, 1931 – August 18, 2009) was an American syndicated columnist, journalist, television personality, author, and conservative political commentator. After working for two newspapers before serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he became a reporter for the Associated Press and then for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He teamed up with Rowland Evans in 1963 to start &quot;Inside Report&quot;, which became the longest running syndicated political column in U.S. history and ran in hundreds of papers. They also started the &quot;Evans-Novak Political Report&quot;, a notable biweekly newsletter, in 1967.

Novak and Evans played a significant role for CNN after the network&#x27;s founding. He worked as a well-known television personality in programs such as &quot;Capital Gang&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, and &quot;Evans, Novak, Hunt, &amp; Shields&quot;. He also wrote for numerous other publications such as &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. He died of a brain tumor on August 18, 2009.

His colleagues nicknamed Novak the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;, a description that he embraced and later used as a title for his autobiography. He started out with moderate or liberal views, but later served as a notable voice for American conservatism in his writing and television appearances.

==Early life==
Novak was born on February 26, 1931, in Joliet, Illinois, the son of Jane Sanders and Maurice Novak, a chemical engineer. His paternal grandparents immigrated from Ukraine, and his mother&#x27;s family was from Lithuania. Novak&#x27;s parents were secular Jews who had little interaction with their local Jewish community and rarely attended religious services. Novak suffered from chronic bronchitis through his early childhood, which led his mother to drive him to and from school instead of letting him walk. Because of the constant family attention, his cousins mockingly called him &quot;Baby Jesus&quot;. Novak also loved to tease, offend, and shock his family from an early age, and he later compared himself to French rebel Bertran de Born.

Novak&#x27;s journalism career began when he was in high school as a student-writer for the &quot;Joliet Herald-News&quot;, his hometown newspaper, and he received ten cents per inch. After high school, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UI) from 1948 to 1952. His father had attended the college, and he later remarked that &quot;I was an Illini from birth&quot;. He became a brother of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, at the time a mostly Jewish college fraternity, while attending the University of Illinois. Novak would later use the group&#x27;s &#x27;secret handshake&#x27; whenever he met fellow alumnus Wolf Blitzer.

He continued gaining journalism experience as a sports writer for the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; (DI), the college&#x27;s student newspaper. Novak wrote how his disappointment about not being named the paper&#x27;s main sports editor for the 1951–52 school year led him to skip his senior classes and to work full time for the &quot;Champaign-Urbana Courier&quot;. After four years at the University, Novak left it to become a full-time journalist without a degree, even though he was only one course short of the requirements. In 1993 a college Dean determined that four mandatory physical education classes that Novak had gone through for no credit should constitute enough credit hours, and Novak received his bachelor&#x27;s degree. Novak later described his academic achievements as &quot;very uneven.&quot; He spoke at the university&#x27;s May 1998 commencement, and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the American middle class.

During the Korean War, Novak served in the U.S. Army, and he reached the rank of lieutenant. He later stated that he had fully expected to die in the service.

==Career==

After serving from 1952 to 1954, Novak rejoined his fledgling journalism career, joining the Associated Press (AP) as a political correspondent in Omaha, Nebraska. He was transferred to Lincoln, Nebraska, and then to Indianapolis, Indiana, covering the two state legislatures in his reporting. In 1957, Novak was transferred to Washington, D.C., where he reported on Congress. He left the AP to join the D.C. bureau of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1958, covering the Senate. He rose to the rank of chief congressional correspondent in 1961. He generally did his work without using tape recordings or paper notes, relying just on his detailed memory. Novak&#x27;s colleagues at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later said that he absorbed himself in his work so completely that he often forgot to shave, left his shoes untied, and even started accidentally placing burning cigarettes into his pockets.

In 1963 Novak teamed up with Rowland Evans, a former Congressional correspondent for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, to create the &quot;Inside Report&quot;, a newspaper column published six times a week. It was also known as &quot;Inside Washington&quot;. Evans knew Novak slightly as a fellow Capitol Hill journalist when they started. They had contrasting public images, with Novak dressing sloppily and Evans&#x27; appearing like a diplomat with a refined manner. Their column mixed standard reporting with their own editorial opinions. It began with muted, mostly centrist views, but their words drifted rightward over time. Novak&#x27;s experience covering the Six-Day War in the field influenced his beliefs towards Evans&#x27; pro-Palestinian sympathies.

The column&#x27;s factual accuracy has been called into question. Novak stated in his autobiography, &quot;We were so ravenous for exclusive news that we were susceptible to manipulation by leaks, compromising our credibility.&quot; &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; became the &quot;home&quot; paper for &quot;Inside Report&quot; from 1966 onward. Novak continued the column after Evans&#x27;s departure on May 15, 1993. Evans died in 2001, and &quot;Inside Report&quot; ran in over 150 papers at that time through Creators Syndicate. Publication ended after Novak&#x27;s cancer diagnosis in July 2008. Bloomberg L.P. has stated that the column was a must-read among political insiders, as did &quot;The Washingtonian&quot;. It was the longest running syndicated political column in U.S. history.

In 1967 Evans and Novak set up a biweekly political newsletter called the &quot;Evans–Novak Political Report&quot; (ENPR). They took a more broad approach in this series compared to their column, focusing on forecast elections and predicting socio-political trends rather than on breaking stories. Regnery Publishing eventually bought ENPR from Novak, but it left editorial control and hiring decisions in Novak&#x27;s hands. In 2006, Timothy P. Carney of Regnery became Novak&#x27;s partner in the newsletter. On February 4, 2009, Novak announced he was ending ENPR&#x27;s publication. This last issue described the implications of Barack Obama&#x27;s election as President, which the authors labeled a political &#x27;paradigm shift&#x27;. Conservative writers such as John Fund, who later worked for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Tim Carney (author of &quot;The Big Ripoff,&quot; &quot;Obamanomics&quot;), and David Freddoso, who later worked for National Review Online, started off as contributors to the ENPR.

Novak became a regular panel member of the syndicated show &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; in 1982, starring alongside McLaughlin as well as Novak&#x27;s friend Jack Germond. Novak sparred frequently with McLaughlin despite the fact that they both held similar political views.

Novak appeared on CNN on its opening week in 1980. His status as a well-known print reporter brought a sense of credibility to the fledgling new network, and Novak soon created a weekly interview show that Evans co-hosted. He established a public image as a combative debater on the program. Novak later became the executive producer of &quot;Capital Gang&quot; on CNN, which also featured him as a panelist on the show and included his friends Al Hunt and Mark Shields. He also took over as host of &quot;Crossfire&quot; from Pat Buchanan.

On August 4, 2005, Novak walked off the set during a live broadcast of the show &quot;Inside Politics&quot;, on which he appeared along with Democratic strategist and analyst James Carville. During a heated discussion about Florida Republican Representative Katherine Harris&#x27;s just-announced 2006 bid for U.S. Senate, Novak uttered &quot;I think that&#x27;s bullshit!&quot; after Carville remarked that Novak had &quot;to show these right-wingers that he&#x27;s got a backbone.&quot; As anchor Ed Henry was asking Carville a question, Novak threw off his microphone and stormed off the set. Critics later charged that Novak had done so to avoid discussing recent developments in the Valerie Plame affair on-air. In response to the incident, CNN suspended Novak for one day and apologized to its viewers, calling the outburst &quot;inexcusable and unacceptable.&quot;

Novak retired from CNN after 25 years on December 23, 2005, stating that his relationship with the network lasted &quot;longer than most marriages.&quot; Novak also said he had &quot;no complaints&quot; about CNN. Fox News had confirmed one week earlier that Novak had signed a contract to do unspecified work for the network. Novak stated that he still would have left CNN even if he had not been suspended in the August incident and did not go to Fox News because the network was more friendly to his point of view. Novak said:

His memoirs, entitled &quot;Prince of Darkness: Fifty Years Reporting in Washington&quot;, were published in July 2007 by Crown Forum, a division of Random House. &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; was a nickname given to Novak by his friend reporter John Lindsay, because Lindsay &quot;thought for a young man I took a very dim view of the prospects for our civilization,&quot; Novak said in an interview. Novak loved the nickname. He once dressed up as Darth Vader to a dinner with the Gridiron Club, and he then sang a song about Dick Cheney as the character. Still, he could be sensitive about his persona; he once asked Democratic Party giant Robert Schwarz Strauss, &quot;Why does everyone take such an instant dislike to me?&quot; Strauss responded, &quot;Saves time.&quot;

At his height, Novak was one of the five most read columnists in the U.S. Throughout his career, Novak wrote for numerous other publications, serving notably as a contributing editor for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. He appeared on NBC&#x27;s program &quot;Meet the Press&quot; over 200 times. He served as a longtime CNN television personality, and he appeared intermittently on Fox News after his August 2005 departure from CNN. Novak also played a role among many other reporters in Timothy Crouse&#x27;s seminal nonfiction book &quot;The Boys on the Bus&quot; that described reporters covering the lead-up to the 1972 Presidential election. In August 2004, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that Novak might &quot;wince unto this day&quot; at his portrayal in the book.

===Recognition===
Novak received an Alumni Achievement Award from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1997. Novak frequently visited his alma mater and interacted with students, establishing a scholarship in his name to support English and rhetoric majors in 1992. He spoke at the college&#x27;s May 1998 commencement, urging graduates to use their education as a &quot;bulwark against tyranny.&quot; Novak also served as a Radford Visiting Professor of Journalism for Baylor University in 1987. He was the 2001 winner of the National Press Club&#x27;s &#x27;Fourth Estate Award&#x27; for lifetime achievement in journalism as well. Novak appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on political strategist Lee Atwater, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;. In the film, Novak says &quot;He tried to get me to write about Governor Dukakis having psychiatric problems but it really was a slander. He thought my weakness was that if I could get an exclusive story, I would jump at it, bite at it and not be as careful as I should be. That may be true, but I was careful enough not to get involved in that one.&quot;

Robert Novak was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1999 in the area of communications.

===Notable events===

====Nixon administration====
Novak pursued a continuous attack upon Richard Nixon&#x27;s key aide H. R. Haldeman. He later wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Bob Haldeman was treated more harshly because he refused any connection with me. He made himself more of a target than he had to be by refusing to be a source.&quot; Novak&#x27;s partner Rowland Evans ended up on Richard Nixon&#x27;s &quot;master list&quot; of enemies, although Novak himself was not mentioned. When they had started the column, Novak paid a &#x27;courtesy call&#x27; to Nixon, who took the opportunity to admonish them to give Republicans a break.

====Ford administration====
Novak, along with collaborator Rowland Evans, learned in 1976 that a high-ranking Ford administration official had privately said that the current Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe was preferable to the radical nationalism that could otherwise have come about. Novak broke the story in his column, which resulted in a government scandal. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has stated that the issue significantly hurt Gerald Ford&#x27;s prospects in the 1976 presidential election.

====Orlando Letelier assassination====
During the FBI investigation into Orlando Letelier&#x27;s assassination, the contents of the briefcase he had with him were copied and leaked to Novak and his partner Rowland Evans as well as Jack Anderson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; by the FBI before being returned to Letelier&#x27;s widow. According to Novak and Evans, the documents showed that Letelier was in constant contact with the leadership of the Unidad Popular exiled in East Berlin and supported by the East German Government. The FBI suspected that these leaders had been recruited by the Stasi. According to Novak, Evans and Anderson, documents in the briefcase showed that Letelier had maintained contact with Salvador Allende&#x27;s daughter, Beatriz Allende, wife of Cuban DGI station chief Luis Fernandez Ona.

According to Novak and Evans, Letelier was able to receive funding of $5,000 a month from the Cuban government and under the supervision of Beatriz Allende, he used his contacts within the Institute for Policy Studies and western human rights groups to organize a campaign within the United Nations as well as the U.S. Congress to isolate Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship. Novak and Evans claimed this was part of an organized campaign to put pressure on Pinochet&#x27;s government closely coordinated by the Cuban and Soviet governments, using individuals like Letelier to implement these efforts. Letelier&#x27;s briefcase also allegedly contained his address book, which contained the names of dozens of known and suspected Eastern Bloc intelligence agents. All correspondence between Letelier and individuals in Cuba was supposedly handled via Julian Rizo, who used his diplomatic status to hide his activities.

Fellow IPS member and friend Saul Landau described Evans and Novak as part of an &quot;organized right wing attack&quot;. In 1980, Letelier&#x27;s widow, Isabel, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the money sent to her late husband from Cuba was from western sources, and that Cuba had simply acted as an intermediary. Reporter John Nichols has written in &quot;The Nation&quot; that observers should &quot;have a hard time forgiving&quot; Novak for his role in the incident.

====Clinton administration====
During the Clinton years, Novak published accusations against administration members including Attorney General Janet Reno using sources such as unnamed FBI agents. Later, when in 2001 FBI agent Robert Hanssen was arrested and revealed to have been working for first the Soviets and then the Russians for 22 years, betraying American agents to their deaths, Novak admitted that Hanssen had been a primary source for some of those accusations.

====CIA leak scandal====

In 2003, he identified Valerie Plame as a CIA &quot;operative&quot; in his column of July 14. In doing so, he indirectly disclosed the organizational name of the company she used as cover, Brewster Jennings &amp; Associates, the other operatives who worked for Brewster Jennings, and the informants who met with them. Although it is illegal for anyone, government official or otherwise, to knowingly distribute classified information (under US Code, Title 18, Section 793, Paragraph e), Novak was never charged with this crime because there was no evidence that Novak knew that Ms. Plame was a covert agent. Novak reported the information was provided to him by two &quot;senior administration officials.&quot; These were eventually revealed to be Richard Armitage, who e-mailed him using the pseudonym &quot;Wildford,&quot; with Novak assuming Karl Rove&#x27;s comments as confirmation. During 2005, there were questions in the press regarding the apparent absence of focus on Novak by the special prosecutor Fitzgerald and the grand jury, specifically questions suggesting he may have already testified about his sources despite insisting publicly that he would not do so.

On July 12, 2006, Novak published a column at &quot;Human Events&quot; stating:

When Richard Armitage admitted to being a source, Novak wrote an op-ed column describing Armitage&#x27;s self-disclosure as &quot;deceptive.&quot;

In 2008, however, an unrepentant Novak said in an interview with Barbara Matusow from the &quot;Nation Ledger&quot;:

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 2010, Valerie Plame said that the disclosure &quot;destroyed (her husband&#x27;s) international consulting business, wrecked her espionage career and nearly took down their marriage&quot;.

In the same interview, Novak also stated:

After Novak&#x27;s death, David Frum commented that the whole episode had been ironic given that Richard Armitage, Joe Wilson, Valerie Plame, and Novak all had exactly the same opinions against a potential war in Iraq.

====Israeli–Palestinian conflict====
Novak took on a pro-Palestinian stance in the conflict, often criticizing Israel. In his syndicated column, Novak blamed Israel for the plight and mass exodus of Palestinian Christians. He has also met with several Palestinian Authority officials, including former Education Minister and Hamas leader Nasser al-Shaer. Novak praised former president Jimmy Carter for likening Israeli policy toward the Palestinians to &quot;apartheid&quot; in Israel. Novak once said that his opinions on Israel caused the greatest amount of his hate mail. He viewed this as understandable, saying &quot;Israel is so important to Jewish people and its preservation is so vital&quot;.

After the 9/11 attacks, Novak stated that he believed the perpetrators had been largely motivated by revenge over U.S. support for Israel. He also argued that the event brought the nations closer together &quot;in a way that cannot improve long-term U.S. policy objectives.&quot; In a November 2001 episode of &quot;Capital Gang&quot;, Novak said, &quot;I am always amazed how American conservatives can get involved in this absolutely mindless support of the transigent Israeli policy.&quot; He argued that Yasser Arafat would be willing to accept Israel&#x27;s right to exist, but Ariel Sharon would never recognize a Palestinian state. He also referred to Hamas as &quot;freedom fighters,&quot; which prompted Margaret Carlson to remark that he&#x27;s &quot;the only person who would call Hamas freedom fighters&quot; and Novak to respond that &quot;people all over the world do.&quot;

The executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, Ira Forman, has called Novak&#x27;s columns on Israel &quot;awful.&quot; David Frum has called his column after the 9/11 attacks an &quot;absurdity.&quot; The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has stated that Novak &quot;ran a running battle with pro-Israel groups, claiming they were unduly influential in Washington&quot; and that he &quot;excoriated Jews in public service who were not shy about their faith.&quot; Reporter John Nichols, writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, has praised Novak&#x27;s views on Israel specifically and on foreign policy in general. Nichols remarked, &quot;Novak maintained a healthy, and very American, disdain for military adventurism.&quot; Activist group Churches for Middle East Peace has also praised Novak&#x27;s stance.

====Amnesty, abortion, and acid====

On April 25, 1972, George McGovern won the Massachusetts primary and Novak phoned Democratic politicians around the country, who agreed with his assessment that traditional blue collar Democratic voters were unaware of McGovern&#x27;s true beliefs. On April 27, 1972, Novak reported in a column that an unnamed Democratic senator had talked to him about McGovern. &quot;The people don&#x27;t know McGovern is for amnesty, abortion, and legalization of pot,&quot; the senator said. &quot;Once middle America—Catholic middle America, in particular—finds this out, he&#x27;s dead.&quot; The label stuck and McGovern became known as the candidate of &quot;amnesty, abortion, and acid,&quot; leading to his defeat that November in a 49-state landslide loss.

Novak was accused of manufacturing the quote. Novak has claimed that, to rebut this criticism, he took the senator to lunch after the campaign and had asked whether he could identify him as the source, but the senator said he would not allow his identity to be revealed. &quot;Oh, he had to run for re-election&quot;, said Novak. &quot;The McGovernites would kill him if they knew he had said that,&quot; Novak added.

On July 15, 2007, Novak disclosed on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Eagleton went on to become the Democratic vice presidential nominee and McGovern&#x27;s running mate briefly in the 1972 election, before it was revealed that he suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life, resulting in several hospitalizations, which when revealed, humiliated the McGovern campaign and resulted in Eagleton being forced to quit the race. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton would never have been selected as McGovern&#x27;s running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote. Shrum said:

Eagleton died on March 4, 2007, &quot;relieving me of the need to conceal his identity,&quot; Novak wrote. Some of Eagleton&#x27;s former aides were reportedly angry that Eagleton&#x27;s name was attached to a quote that made him appear duplicitous. Asked about the story, Novak acknowledged that disclosing Eagleton&#x27;s identity was &quot;a judgment on my part.&quot; If there is any disagreement, Eagleton could settle it with him in heaven &quot;or wherever we end up,&quot; Novak added.

==Political views==
Novak was a registered Democrat, despite his conservative political views. He held more centrist views in his early career, and he supported the Democratic presidential candidacies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, of whom he was a friend. In later years, he said that he maintained his registered Democratic status so he could vote in District of Columbia Democratic primaries where victory would be tantamount to election. He was also close friends with Everett Dirksen. Novak later stated that reading Whittaker Chambers&#x27; book &quot;Witness&quot; changed his views from moderate-to-liberal to a strident anticommunism. Reading Chambers&#x27; message as a U.S. Army lieutenant in the Korean War gave him a feeling of moral absolutism in his cause. Novak&#x27;s views turned further rightward through the 1970s, but Novak remained strongly critical toward Ronald Reagan and his supply side economics in the early 1980s. Novak changed his mind after debating economics with Reagan face to face, and he later wrote that Reagan was one of the very few politicians that he ever respected.

Novak strongly supported wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Grenada, but he took an anti-interventionist stance after that. He was a hard-line social conservative as well, holding anti-abortion and anti-divorce views. He also generally tended toward low-tax, small-government libertarian views, but he did not always agree with mainstream Republicans; in particular, he opposed the Iraq War. For this reason he has been called a paleoconservative, although this label has been disputed. Novak&#x27;s political column once stated that he considered every single president in his lifetime to be a failure, with the lone exception of Reagan. After Novak&#x27;s death on August 18, 2009, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described him as an independent voice. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that Novak felt &quot;glee&quot; at starting interparty fighting.

In July 2007, Novak expressed support for Ron Paul&#x27;s bid for the presidency. In the same year, and shortly after the summer publication of Novak&#x27;s memoirs, he was interviewed by former columnist Bill Steigerwald. Asked of the future of the country, Novak said:

David Frum, writing for &quot;National Review&quot;, essentially dismissed Novak as a contributor to the modern conservative movement in March 2003. His statement prompted a rejoinder from Novak and defenses by other commentators. Frum then wrote his book &quot;The Right Man&quot; motivated by what he called &quot;Novak&#x27;s disregard for truth.&quot; Novak attacked Frum again in his autobiography, labeling Frum a &quot;liar&quot; and a &quot;cheat&quot;. After Novak&#x27;s death, Frum wrote on his blog criticizing Novak while also reflecting that &quot;Novak and I were fated always to misunderstand one another.&quot;

==Religious views==
Raised in secular Jewish culture, Novak lived seven decades as an agnostic. He briefly attended Unitarian and then Methodist services at the behest of his first and second wives, but he was not interested in either faith. He particularly disliked the Methodists&#x27; anti-Vietnam War position. Novak was introduced to Catholic Christianity in the early 1980s when his friend Jeffrey Bell, a Republican political consultant and former Reagan aide, gave him some books on the Catholic faith. At that time, Novak had nearly died from spinal meningitis.

Novak&#x27;s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in the early 1990s and eventually settled on St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak asked her if she was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. &quot;Mr Novak,&quot; the young woman replied, &quot;life is short, but eternity is forever.&quot; That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they decided it was time to convert. In May 1998, Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak&#x27;s baptism.

McCloskey was one of the two priests—the other was Vaghi—from whom Novak received instruction in the Catholic faith. Andrew Sullivan claimed that Novak was a member of Opus Dei. John L. Allen Jr., however, in his authoritative study, &quot;Opus Dei&quot;, wrote that Novak was not a member. Novak felt that his new faith did not influence his personal behavior or his political views, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a Christian now, but I still have some bad traits.&quot;

==Final years==
On July 23, 2008, Novak received a police citation for failing to yield a right of way to an 86-year-old pedestrian, Don Clifford Liljenquist, who was struck by Novak in slow-moving traffic and taken to a hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries. Novak left the scene of the crash, driving approximately one block from the scene before being flagged down by a cyclist who had witnessed the collision and then called police. He said that he was unaware that a collision had occurred until being informed by eyewitnesses. This is likely to be accurate, as it is typical in patients with nondominant (usually right-sided) brain tumors that cause left-sided visual problems (including visual neglect), which Novak had (&quot;I have lost not only left peripheral vision but nearly all my left vision&quot;). The pedestrian was taken to George Washington University Hospital and treated for a dislocated shoulder. There were numerous reports from D.C.-area residents that Novak was prone to road rage and had a habit of flipping off motorists; however, he denied that these complaints were true. &quot;I&#x27;m 77 years old. I&#x27;m not an aggressive driver anymore.&quot; he said shortly after the July 23 incident. When asked about his Corvette, Novak replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been driving them since 1961.&quot;

On July 27, 2008, four days after the car accident, Novak was admitted to Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston, where he was diagnosed with brain cancer. In a written statement given to his publisher, Novak said: &quot;Doctors will soon begin appropriate treatment. I will be suspending my journalistic work for an indefinite but, God willing, not too lengthy period.&quot; Physicians often check for brain tumors in patients who did not realize they struck something in a car accident, as this can be a focal neurologic sign. Novak tendered his resignation from his column on August 4, 2008, after revealing that the prognosis on his tumor was considered &quot;dire&quot;. Later that month, he began writing new opinion columns for Creators Syndicate.

On February 4, 2009, Novak announced in his newsletter, the &quot;Evans-Novak Political Report&quot;, that the biweekly newsletter would be coming to an end due to his illness. The newsletter, started four years after the column, had been published continuously since 1967.

==Personal life==
Novak&#x27;s first wife was Rosanna Hall; they divorced. In 1962, he married Geraldine Williams, who was a secretary for President Lyndon B. Johnson. Their daughter, Zelda, worked for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign and for Vice President Dan Quayle. They have a son, Alex, who works as an editor at Regnery Publishing. Although friends with social commentator Michael Novak, Robert Novak was not related.

Novak converted to Catholicism in May 1998 after his wife, Geraldine, did so. He had two children, a daughter and a son.

In his later life, Novak drove a 2002 black Corvette and he had his license suspended several times for speeding. He also participated in a charity car race in Sebring, Florida, which he won. &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine labeled him a &quot;speed freak.&quot; Novak was also a passionate fan of basketball, particularly of the Washington Bullets (now Wizards), and the Maryland Terrapins men&#x27;s basketball team. He was a member of the Terrapins Club booster organization. Wolf Blitzer remarked in August 2009, &quot;I always used to see him ... Redskins games, Wizards games, always there.&quot;

Novak died on August 18, 2009, at the age of 78, due to complications from a brain tumor. He had returned home to spend his last days with his family after being hospitalized from July 10 to 24. He was interred at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<text>John Raleigh Mott (May 25, 1865 – January 31, 1955) was an evangelist and long-serving leader of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) and the World Student Christian Federation (WSCF). He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946 for his work in establishing and strengthening international Protestant Christian student organizations that worked to promote peace. He shared the prize with Emily Balch. From 1895 until 1920 Mott was the General Secretary of the WSCF. Intimately involved in the formation of the World Council of Churches in 1948, that body elected him as a lifelong honorary President. He helped found the World Student Christian Federation in 1895, the 1910 World Missionary Conference and the World Council of Churches in 1948. His best-known book, &quot;The Evangelization of the World in this Generation&quot;, became a missionary slogan in the early 20th century.

==Biography==
Mott was born in Livingston Manor, Sullivan County, New York, on May 25, 1865, and his family moved to Postville, Iowa, in September of the same year. He attended Upper Iowa University, where he studied history and was an award-winning student debater. He transferred to Cornell University, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1888. He was influenced by Arthur Tappan Pierson one of the forces behind the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, which was founded in 1886. 

In 1910, Mott, an American Methodist layperson, presided at the 1910 World Missionary Conference, which was an important milestone in the modern Protestant missions movement and some say the modern ecumenical movement.

Mott and a colleague were offered free passage on the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912 by a White Star Line official who was interested in their work, but they declined and took the more humble liner the . According to a biography by C. Howard Hopkins, in New York City the two men heard what happened to the &quot;Titanic&quot;, looked at each other and remarked that, &quot;The Good Lord must have more work for us to do.&quot;

After touring Europe and promoting ecumenism, Mott traveled to Asia where, from October 1912 to May 1913, he held a series of 18 regional and national conferences, including in Ceylon, India, Burma, Malaya, China, Korea and Japan.

He also worked with Robert Hallowell Gardiner III to maintain relations with the Russian Orthodox Church and Archbishop Tikhon after the Russian Revolution.

From 1920 until 1928, Mott served as the WSCF Chairperson. For his labors in both missions and ecumenism, as well as for peace, some historians consider him to be &quot;the most widely traveled and universally trusted Christian leader of his time&quot;.

== Personal life and legacy ==
Mott married twice. His first wife was a teacher, Leila Ada White. They married in 1891 and had two sons and two daughters, including Irene Mott Bose, a social worker in India, and wife of Indian Supreme Court justice Vivian Bose; John Livingstone Mott, who received the Kaisar-i‐Hind silver medal in 1931, for his work with the YMCA in India; and Frederick Dodge Mott, who worked in healthcare planning in Canada, and was Canada&#x27;s representative to the World Health Organization. 

After Leila Mott died in 1952, Mott remarried in 1953, to Agnes Peter, a descendant of Martha Custis Washington. He died in 1955, in Orlando, Florida, aged 89 years. His papers are held at the Yale Divinity School Library.

==Veneration==
In 2022, John Raleigh Mott was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on October 3.

The high school of the Postville Community School District in Postville, Iowa, is named after him.

<text>Taipei Songshan Airport is a city airport and military airbase located in Songshan District, Taipei, Taiwan. The airport covers an area of .

The civilian section of Songshan Airport has scheduled flights to domestic destinations in Taiwan and international destinations including Seoul, Tokyo, and select cities in China. Songshan serves only a small portion of the international flights for Taipei compared to the larger Taoyuan International Airport. Songshan Airport is also the base of certain Republic of China Air Force units as part of the Songshan Air Force Base. The Songshan Base Command&#x27;s main mission is to serve the president and vice president of Taiwan.

==History==
The airport was built on 28 March 1936 during Japanese rule with its origins as a Japanese military airbase, the , also known as . In 1937, Matsuyama Airfield was occupied by the Japanese Navy&#x27;s Kanoya Air Group and its Type 96 G3M bombers for bombing positions on Chinese positions. On August 14, 1937, an 18-bomber mission launched from Matsuyama Airfield targeted Jianqiao Airfield in Zhejiang Province and Guangde Airfield in Anhui Province, both in China. The raid was intercepted by Chinese fighter aircraft, resulting in the loss of four bombers without any casualties on the Chinese side. This date was later celebrated as Air Force Day in China. In 1944, the Japanese Army’s 37th Kyoiku Hikotai, a training unit equipped with Ki-61 fighters, was established at Matsuyama. Many of its instructors later engaged in combat against American forces over Taiwan and Japan during the war’s final months. From March to August, 1945, the US Army Far East Air Forces bombed the airfield, with the last mission on 24 August using B-24 heavy bombers.

After World War II, in 1946, it was taken over by the Republic of China Air Force, and renamed to Songshan Airport. Before the end of the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the airport provided flight routes between Shanghai and Taipei, occasionally via Fuzhou.

Shared military and civilian use—both domestic and international—began on 16 April 1950 in the reconstructed Civil Aeronautics Administration Taipei Airport (). Domestic destinations have been Kaohsiung, Hualien, Taichung, Penghu, and Tainan. The first international destinations were Seattle, Tokyo, Busan, Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong. The first international airlines included Northwest Airlines, Pan Am, and Hong Kong Airways (now Cathay Pacific). Later, the airport became too small to handle an increased number of passengers, even after a series of expansions. This later worsened when new wide-body jets became common at the airport. Therefore, all international activities were relocated to Taoyuan International Airport (then known as Chiang Kai-shek International) after its inauguration on 26 February 1979. Consequently, the passenger load at the airport dropped from 6.2 million in 1978 to 2.9 million in 1979 (a 53% decrease). At its peak in 1997, the airport handled over 15.3 million passengers annually.

Service to Taichung and Chiayi was stopped in mid-2007 after the load factor dropped significantly due to the Taiwan High Speed Rail&#x27;s start of revenue service in January 2007. Passenger volume decreased from 6.7 million in 2006 to 4.4 million in 2007 (a 34% decrease). Also due to the opening of the high speed rail line, on 1 March 2008, Uni Air suspended its service to Kaohsiung, while Far Eastern Air Transport suspended its service to Tainan. TransAsia Airways decided to stop flights to Tainan and Kaohsiung after 1 August 2008.

In early 1999 when the construction of Taipei 101 had just started, Taiwan&#x27;s Civil Aeronautics Administration changed this airport&#x27;s certain SID and STAR procedures to avoid possible collision with the building. The 677-meter () was constructed between 1997 and 2006 under this airport&#x27;s runway to link the north and south side of this airport.

Regular cross-strait charter flights to China started on 4 July 2008, with Songshan receiving the majority of flights. Direct flights to China were an issue of contention. Then-mayor Ma Ying-jeou had been pressing to make Songshan Airport Taipei&#x27;s main International terminal, citing that its location close to the city center would make it preferable for business travelers. However, building height restrictions around the airport raised concerns about flight safety, blocking of radio communications, noise pollution, and a reduced number of flights.

The continuing growth of Taipei City means that Songshan airport is situated in the heart of downtown Taipei. Compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Songshan Airport saves travelers about 30 minutes due to its location inside Taipei City&#x27;s central business district, but the city suffers from the noise, pollution, restrictions on urban planning, and traffic congestion the airport brings about. In the 2002 and 2006 Taipei Mayor Election DPP candidates Lee Ying-yuan and Frank Hsieh both proposed the plan to close Songshan Airport, and developed its land into road, huge park, detention basin and sports arena, since the Taiwan High Speed Rail could quickly take up the traffic load between Taipei and western Taiwan cities, and the remaining service to outlying islands and eastern Taiwan could be easily taken over by the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after the completion of the Taoyuan International Airport Access MRT System by the end of 2016. Also, the MRT system will make the international potential of Songshan airport less attractive. The Songshan Airport closing proposal was deferred under the Taipei City Government which has long been dominated by the Pan-Blue Coalition, who prefers the downtown airport connection concept with Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.

Due to the introduction of Taiwan-China flights and future international potential, the airport is undergoing extensive renovations, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by October 2010. The second and third phase renovations are expected to be completed by March and October 2011, respectively. However, as of November 2011 renovations are still in progress. A new international cargo terminal is being built in anticipation of a new air route between Taiwan and Japan. The unused Terminal 2 was refurbished to accommodate arriving flights while the main Terminal, now Terminal 1, was rearranged to handle increased passenger traffic. On 29 March 2011, the renovated Terminal 2 was re-opened to handle domestic flights.

==International potential==

Similar to Buenos Aires–Aeroparque, London–City, Milan–Linate, and Toronto–Billy Bishop airports, Songshan Airport is seen to have the potential to attract business travellers within Pacific Asia due to its location in downtown Taipei. Flights to Bangkok–Don Mueang, Jakarta–Halim Perdanakusuma, Kuala Lumpur–Subang, Nagoya–Komaki, Osaka–Itami, Seoul–Gimpo, Singapore–Seletar, Shanghai–Hongqiao, and Tokyo–Haneda are especially attractive since these airports are also closer to the central areas or business districts of their respective cities, and all these cities have larger far flung international airports. The airport is currently in the process of expansion to better accommodate international flights.

On 6 March 2009, Japan and Taiwan signed a memorandum of understanding on the revision of Taiwan–Japan bilateral traffic. Four carriers (EVA Air, China Airlines, Japan Airlines, and All Nippon Airways) would be able to operate from Songshan Airport to Tokyo–Haneda. In December 2009, an affirmative schedule for the route between Tokyo–Haneda and Taipei–Songshan was announced. Starting in October 2010, EVA Air, China Airlines, Japan Airlines, and All Nippon Airways each operates two flights a day from Taipei–Songshan to Tokyo–Haneda, with China Airlines and EVA Air both utilizing the Airbus A330-300 on the route. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines began this route with the Boeing 767-300ER, but have phased in the newer Boeing 787-8 on the route beginning in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Japan Airlines also previously used the Boeing 777-200ER on this route.

On 14 June 2010, direct flights between Taipei–Songshan and Shanghai–Hongqiao began. Each week has 28 flights, served by China Eastern Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Air China, China Airlines, EVA Air, and TransAsia Airways. The airport will undergo upgrades to its runway and reduce its jet bridges from eight to six to accommodate wider contemporary aircraft such as the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular passenger flights at Songshan:

==Traffic and statistics==
In 2018, Songshan Airport handled 6,225,932 passengers and 47,132.9 tons of cargo. The route between Taipei Songshan and Kinmen is the busiest domestic route in Taiwan, with 1,267,630 travelers in 2018. In 2018, the ten routes with the largest number of passengers are as follows:

<doc id="322437" wikidata="Q956029" url="?curid=322437" title="Donny Lalonde">
<text>Donny Lalonde (born March 12, 1960) is a retired professional
boxer. His nickname is &quot;Golden Boy,&quot; after the Golden Boy statue atop the Manitoba Legislative Building in his boxing home town of Winnipeg. Lalonde held the WBC Light Heavyweight Championship from 1987 to 1988.

==Early career==
Lalonde was born in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. He got into boxing &quot;to try to reestablish self-esteem, respect, pride,&quot; he said. &quot;Boxing is a way of doing that.&quot; Lalonde had an amateur record of 11-4 and turned professional in 1980.

==Early professional career==
Lalonde won his first four fights and then lost a six-round decision to Wilbert &quot;Vampire&quot; Johnson in March 1981. They had a rematch seven months later, which Lalonde won by a second-round knockout.

In 1983, Lalonde won the Canadian Light Heavyweight Championship, knocking out Roddie McDonald in ten rounds. He defeated McDonald even though he had a smashed middle knuckle on his right hand and was recovering from surgery on his left shoulder, which he first separated when he crashed into the boards while playing hockey in 1977.

Over the years, the shoulder had separated some thirty times and had become so loose that he was able to pop it back into socket himself. To prepare for his fight with McDonald, he underwent an operation in which doctors inserted a pin to bind the joint, which severely restricted his ability to raise his left arm. It affected Lalonde&#x27;s style: He would paw with his left, looking to set up his powerful right.

In 1985, with a record of 19-1, Lalonde fought Willie Edwards for the NABF Light Heavyweight Championship. Edwards stopped Lalonde in nine rounds.

==Rise to the top==
At the end of 1985, Lalonde hired Dave Wolf as his manager and Teddy Atlas as his trainer. Lalonde went 8-0 with Atlas as his trainer, but they clashed in temperament and style. He and Atlas parted ways, and Lalonde hired Tommy Gallagher and Bobby Cassidy as his new trainers.

In his first fight with Gallagher and Cassidy, he outpointed Mustafa Hamsho on May 7, 1987. His next fight was for a world title. On November 27, 1987, Lalonde knocked out Eddie Davis in two rounds to win the vacant WBC Light Heavyweight Championship in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. His first title defense was also in Port of Spain. On May 29, 1988, he knocked out former WBA Light Heavyweight Champion Leslie Stewart in five rounds.

On November 7, 1988, Lalonde fought Sugar Ray Leonard at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was by far the biggest fight of his career. Lalonde&#x27;s purse was six million dollars. They fought for Lalonde&#x27;s WBC Light Heavyweight Championship and the newly created WBC Super Middleweight Championship, which meant that Lalonde had to make 168 lbs. Some were concerned that moving down from the light heavyweight limit of 175 lbs would weaken Lalonde, but he told HBO&#x27;s Larry Merchant after the fight that he had no trouble making weight, and he felt great on the night of the fight.

Lalonde&#x27;s size and awkwardness troubled Leonard. In the fourth round, a right hand to the top of Leonard&#x27;s head dropped him for just the second time in his career. Early in the ninth, Lalonde hurt Leonard with a right to the chin. Leonard fired back and hurt Lalonde with a right. He drove him to the ropes and unleashed a furious assault. Lalonde tried to tie up Leonard, but got dropped with a powerful left hook. He rose but was soon down again, and the fight was stopped. Leonard won his fourth and fifth world titles.

==Retirement and return==
After Leonard vacated the WBC Light Heavyweight Championship, Lalonde was scheduled to fight Dennis Andries for the title on June 24, 1989 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Shortly before the fight, Lalonde shocked many by retiring. &quot;I just don&#x27;t have the desire to hit people anymore,&quot; Lalonde said.

Lalonde returned to boxing in 1991. After four straight wins, he fought Bobby Czyz for the WBA Cruiserweight Championship on May 9, 1992 in Las Vegas. Czyz dropped Lalonde in the first round with a left hook. Lalonde got up and survived the round, but for the rest of the fight, Czyz continued to come forward and land effectively with left jabs and hooks. Czyz retained his title with a twelve-round unanimous decision.

After losing to Czyz, Lalonde was inactive for four years. He returned to the ring and won three straight fights, then fought a six-round draw with Kevin Pompey in 1998. Lalonde stayed out of the ring again until 2002. After three consecutive wins, Lalonde fought former two-division champion Virgil Hill in Winnipeg on July 7, 2003.

In the first round, Lalonde fell into the ropes after getting hit by a left hook. The referee ruled it a knockdown, but Lalonde said the fall was due more to bad footwork. Lalonde spent most of the fight backpedaling and looking to land his right hand. Hill controlled the fight, landing frequently with jabs and hooks while avoiding Lalonde&#x27;s powerful right. Hill won by a ten-round unanimous decision. It was Lalonde&#x27;s last fight. He finished with a record of 41-5-1 with 33 knockouts.

==Teddy Atlas&#x27; book revelation==
In 2006, Teddy Atlas published his autobiography, &quot;Atlas: From the Streets to the Ring: A Son&#x27;s Struggle to Become a Man&quot;. In the book, he revealed that he came close to murdering Lalonde. &quot;When he made six million for Leonard, it tore me up,&quot; Atlas wrote. &quot;It made me murderous.&quot; If Atlas had not been fired by Lalonde and he had trained him for the Leonard fight, he would&#x27;ve gotten 10% of his purse, $600,000.

Atlas described getting a gun and going to Lalonde&#x27;s apartment building in New York City. After getting buzzed into the building by another tenant, Atlas went to Lalonde&#x27;s apartment and knocked on the door. &quot;If he had opened the door, he was dead,&quot; Atlas wrote. &quot;I would have pulled the trigger, turned around, and walked away.&quot; However, there was no answer.

Atlas waited through the night for Lalonde to return, periodically phoning the apartment. When he finally got through, Lalonde&#x27;s girlfriend answered. When asked if Lalonde was home, she said yes. Atlas hung up and started making his way over to the apartment. Somewhere along the way, for whatever reason, Atlas changed his mind.

Lalonde knew nothing about it until the book came out and a friend told him about it. &quot;It actually didn&#x27;t surprise me when I heard it,&quot; he said. &quot;Teddy got into fights with trainers and fighters quite a bit when I was with him. He may not be the most stable person walking around.&quot;

==Honors==
Lalonde was inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1990.

==T.K.O.O.O==
Lalonde is now aiming to help boxers live a healthier life in their golden years through his initiative &quot;TKOOO&quot; (Taking &quot;K&quot;are Of Our Own). Its mission is to educate fighters on the benefits of natural and preventative medicine, including the reduction or elimination of the trauma induced by effects of combat sport.

==Controversies==
In 2004, Lalonde declared bankruptcy in B.C., owing $1.5 million to creditors, mostly linked to failed real estate ventures, and moved to Tamarindo in northwestern Costa Rica where he sold pre-construction lots in a new community. Ten years later, about 30 investors hired a lawyer, hoping to recoup $3.5 million in a class-action lawsuit. As of 2020, no development has taken place

==Personal life==
Lalonde meditates daily and was known to have prayed before his fights that nobody would be hurt. In 1988, William Nack commented that Lalonde&#x27;s &quot;diet is chiefly vegetarian; he eschews all processed foods. He drinks juices out of his own squeezer and eats his meals with chopsticks. He trains to the music of Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens. He submits himself daily to the painful rigors of deep-tissue massaging, or rolfing.&quot;

<text>Magong (POJ: &quot;Má-keng&quot;) is a county-administered city and seat of Penghu County, Taiwan. Magong City is located on Penghu&#x27;s main island.

== Name ==
The settlement&#x27;s temple honoring the Chinese Goddess Mazu, the deified form of Lin Moniang from medieval Fujian Province, is usually accounted the oldest in all of Taiwan and Penghu. The town was originally named Makeng () but was changed to during Japanese rule in 1920, and was the center of the Mako Guard District.

After 1945, the Wade-Giles romanization Makung was used. Taiwan officially adopted Tongyong Pinyin in 2002 and Hanyu Pinyin in 2009, leading to the romanization Magong.

==History==

The island&#x27;s Mazu temple was erected in the late 16th or early 17th century. The city Magong&#x27;ao began to grow around 1887, during the rule of the Qing dynasty.

Under Japanese rule, the settlement was renamed Makō and organized as a subprefecture of Hōko. The area was a major base of the Imperial Japanese Navy. It was an embarkation point for the invasion of the Philippines during the Second World War.

===Republic of China===
On 25 December 1981, Makung was upgraded from an urban township to a county-administered city.

== Administration ==
Magong City contains 33 municipal villages ():

==Education==
* National Penghu University of Science and Technology

==Energy==

The city is powered by the Hujing Power Plant located on Table Island.

== Climate ==
Magong has a very warm humid subtropical climate under the Köppen system. Due to the maritime influence, diurnal temperature variation is very low, but in spite of being right on the boundary with the tropics and having winter lows it falls short of being such a climate. This is courtesy of the influence of the cool Asian landmass and prevailing winds in winter. As a result, the coldest month just falls short of the isotherm. In summer, Magong receives monsoonal rainfall with moderated but hot temperatures. While afternoons most often stay in the low 30&#x27;s Celsius, nights remain above for several months. It is drier than many mainland areas of Taiwan, although it still frequently is cloudy.

<doc id="322446" wikidata="Q1710" url="?curid=322446" title="Isabela, Basilan">
<text>Isabela, officially the City of Isabela (Chavacano: &quot;Ciudad de Isabela&quot;; Tausūg: &quot;Dāira sin Isabela&quot;; Yakan: &quot;Siudad Isabelahin&quot;; ), is a component city and &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the province of Basilan, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 130,379 people making it the most populous city in the province.

It is also colloquially known as Isabela de Basilan to differentiate the city&#x27;s name from the province of Isabela in Luzon.

While administratively the island province of Basilan is part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), Isabela, which previously served as its capital since the province&#x27;s creation, itself is not part of this region, being placed instead under the Zamboanga Peninsula region. While the city is still regulated by the Basilan provincial government and provincial services are provided by Basilan, regional services are provided by the Zamboanga Peninsula regional government. The Philippine Statistics Authority lists Isabela as statistically independent from Basilan. This prompted the provincial government to transfer the capital to Lamitan.

Institutionally, the military has played a major part in Isabela&#x27;s and Basilan&#x27;s volatile history, due to the ongoing conflicts borne out of the Moro Secessionist wars of the 1970s, and more recently, by Al Qaeda backed Islamic fundamentalist groups fomenting a running gun-battle with the Philippines&#x27; armed forces for more than a decade.

Also exerting great influence in everyday life is the Roman Catholic Church and the Islamic mufti and imams, religious scholars and leaders who exercise a moral ascendancy over their respective groups.

Trading and commerce are still predominantly in the hands of the East Asian (Hokkien Chinese), aided more so by a recent influx of immigrants from Taiwan and by Koreans as well.

==History==
Isabela&#x27;s history is inadvertently intermingled with that of Basilan Island and the Sulu Archipelago, albeit culturally, Isabela is an extension of neighboring Zamboanga City.

===Pre-Hispanic History===
Basilan&#x27;s earliest settlers was traditionally believed to be the Orang Dampuans originating from the islands of Eastern Indonesia, who were the ancestors of the native Yakans. They are variously called the Orang Dyaks or the Tagihamas.

The Yakans, an inland brave tribe, inhabited the Sulu Archipelago together with the indigenous Sama and Bajau before the Malayan Tausug from Sumatra and Borneo gained control of the area starting 300BCE-200BCE.

Historians have scant knowledge of the pre-Spanish history of the indigenous Yakans, simply because they have had little contact with other ethnic groups. Basilan&#x27;s nearness to Borneo led to the theory that the Yakan originated from the Dyak. Although it is fairly safe to say that Basilan&#x27;s history is related to that of the Sulu archipelago, it is by no means right to suppose that Basilan&#x27;s first inhabitants came from Indonesia.

====Yakan Karajaan of Kumalarang====
Records of pre-Hispanic Philippines gleaned from the extensive archives of China&#x27;s Imperial courts mentions a Kingdom of Kumalarang located in one of the southern islands of &quot;Mayi&quot; (the Chinese name for the Philippine archipelago), whose King sent regular tribute to the Chinese Yongle Emperor through Chinese traders who frequented the place in the 13th and 14th centuries. Local historians attribute this long lost kingdom to modern-day Kumalarang (now reduced to a Barangay) located along the northwestern coast of Basilan island.

Specifically, according to the &quot;Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty&quot;, a report gleaned from the records of Dezhou, Shandong, China (archived and researched in the years 1673, 1788 and 1935): 3 months after the death of Paduka Batara (the Tausug potentate who visited the Chinese Emperor Yongle and died on October 23, 1417), a High Court Mandarin, Zhan Jian, was ordered to sail to Kumalarang (Chinese texts refer to &quot;Kumalalang&quot;), a vassal state of the Sulu Sultanate located on the northwestern coast of Taguima (Basilan Is.).

Zhan Jian was received by Lakan Ipentun (Ch. ref. &quot;Kanlai Ipentun&quot;), presumably a Yakan Prince, who ruled the Kingdom as a vassal to the Sultan of Sulu. The Mandarin official stayed in Kumalarang for two years before returning to China.
He was accompanied by Lakan Ipentun and an entourage of several hundred, composed of his immediate family, minor chieftains (datus), and servants. They were finally given an audience with the Chinese Emperor on November 16, 1420, where he formally asked the latter to proclaim him as a recognized sovereign and vassal to the Dragon Throne.

Lakan Ipentun wrote a missive to the Chinese Emperor on December 28, 1420, complaining about the time it took for the Chinese Emperor to act on his request. The Chinese Emperor received the petition and finally granted Lakan Ipentun with the title of &quot;wang&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). After his request was granted, a satisfied Lakan Ipentun, along with his entire retinue, started for home.

On May 27, 1421, however, unaccustomed to the cold climate of the preceding winter and due to his advancing age, Lakan Ipentun died in Fujian, China, just as they were about to embark on Chinese junks that would have brought them home. His funeral was supervised by Yang Shan, administrator of the temples, and was likewise honored by a eulogy sent by the Chinese Emperor which extolled his virtues of &quot;determination and serenity&quot;. His son, Lapi, was then proclaimed as rightful successor to the just bestowed title of &quot;wang&quot;. Lapi sent one of his father&#x27;s most trusted officials, Batikisan, to petition for an audience with the Chinese Emperor where he presented a &quot;memorial&quot; in gold plaque on November 3, 1424.

The party, with its newly proclaimed King, eventually returned to Kumalarang, and almost just as promptly faded from the historical records of the period. (Note: Kumalarang was revived as a Barangay located on the northwestern shores of Isabela City in 1973).

===Spanish arrival===
====Colonization and the Jesuit &quot;reducciones&quot;====

The proselytization of Basilan started in earnest when Fr. Francisco Lado, a Jesuit, established the first Catholic mission, in an area called Pasangen by the native Yakans. &quot;Pasangen&quot; is a Yakan term for &quot;commune&quot;, &quot;town&quot; or &quot;a place where people visit or stay&quot;. This coastal area, however, was already predominantly populated by Tausug and Samal settlers when the Spanish came, and therefore was likewise locally called a &quot;pagpasalan&quot; or &quot;settlement area&quot;. The Jesuit missionaries from Zamboanga arrived on the same year that the removal of Sultan Kudarat&#x27;s base from Lamitan was effected, and established themselves in Pasangen on the island&#x27;s northwestern coast. They constructed the first wooden mission and palisade wall near the mouth of the Aguada River and dedicated the Island to St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit Order.

Catholic missionaries together with Spanish soldiers who inter-married into the native population were able to successfully penetrate Basilan by bringing in additional Settler soldiers. So much so that by 1654 about 1,000 Catholic families were living on the island. Foremost among these pioneering families is the extended Lazaro Clan who, together with its cadet branches, the Saavedra, Generalao, Sison, Pardo, Barrios and Guevarra families, took most of the cultivated lands that were to form part of the growing Settlement.

Thus, Catholicism began to slowly spread across the island with the spirited drive of the militant Jesuits. With no spices or gold to enrich the Spanish king&#x27;s coffers, except for local taxes, the Jesuits refocused the Spanish government&#x27;s agenda and made religion the object of their expansion and conquest here.

In anticipation of an invasion from the Chinese pirate-warlord Koxinga, that was expected to devastate Manila, the Spanish authorities withdrew all stations in the south of the country to augment their forces holed up in Intramuros, temporarily freeing Zamboanga and Isabela from direct Spanish administration in 1663.
Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara signed a decree on May 6, 1662, ordering the military evacuation of the fort in Zamboanga, and of other Spanish colonies, including that of Ternate in the spice islands of the Moluccas. The Spanish garrisons, along with several priests and their chosen local people, evacuated and returned to Fort Cavite to help defend Manila Intramuros from a threatened invasion by Chinese pirate Koxinga, which never happened. The Zamboanga fort was finally abandoned sometime in 1663 by the last remaining Spanish troops.

As fate will have it, the Zamboangueño (the forced Settlers from Luzon and Visayas who populated Zamboanga) and Pasangen, Jesuits included, will amazingly endure another 56 years (1662–1718) of isolated existence and proliferation amidst the hostile threat and return of the Moro master seafarers who overtook and destroyed the abandoned fort. The Zamboangueños who stayed behind, including many of the founding Jesuit priests who vowed to never forsake their thousands of converted subjects and their new-found religious outpost (prized as the southernmost Catholic strongholds in the entire Philippine islands), were by this time already living within the confines of Zamboanga and Pasangen and its people. The Jesuits, belonging to the aggressive religious expansionists&#x27; Society of Jesus, who remained in Zamboanga were historically credited for reconstructing the damaged fort in 1666, three years after the last Spanish soldiers vacated the walled post in 1663.

In the absence of Spanish Royal authorities, the Jesuits formed a sort of Catholic city-state, called &quot;reductions&quot; (Spanish Reducciones, Portuguese Reduções) in and around their 3-decade-old Presidios both in Zamboanga and Basilan. These were Societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model. The same type of communities were likewise established by the Jesuits throughout South America, but especially in present-day Brazil and Paraguay.
The Spanish royal authorities eventually returned in 1718. After having re-established lucrative trading agreements with the native kingdoms that dotted the area, nearby Zamboanga experienced a revival in its economy. The increasingly wealthy Spanish trading post in Zamboanga became an even more sought-after prize for the Moro seafarers of the era, so much so that the surrounding islands started to attract the attention of other foreign powers, and chief among these coveted islands was Basilan.

Hostilities with the Moro natives and Lumad allies resurfaced in the 18th century and this was triggered by the decision which broke beforehand agreements not to build any additional Forts by both parties when in 1718 Gov. Gen Juan Antonio de la Torre Bustamante went ahead to reconstruct Real Fuerza de San José in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga. The fort completed in 1719 was renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar is its popular name today). The rebuilt fort was inaugurated on April 16 by Don Fernando Bustillos Bustamante Rueda, senior maestro de campo of Zamboanga. Three years later in 1722, as the primary reason to build this Fort, the Spaniards were launching another expedition against Jolo. Led by Andres Garcia, the expedition failed miserably.
By then, Badar ud-Din, Sultan of Sulu, who was keenly interested in developing commercial ties with Manila and China, approached the Spanish with a proposal of peace. According to the agreement they arrived at in 1726, the Spanish and Sulu were permitted to trade freely with each other and the Island of Basilan was ceded to Spain. However, in a series of raids on the islands of Visayas, where the Spanish themselves got manpower and resources for Zamboanga, angry subjects of the Sultan broke the treaty which resulted in the renewal of large-scale hostilities by 1730. In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege. But the Spaniards left after a few days.

To strengthen the Spanish position in Zamboanga and the neighbouring regions, three companies of native Visayan volunteers were organized in 1832. These natives together with the Spanish troops defended the town and the province from the sporadic attack by the Moros. However, these Visayan natives, mixed with released prisoners from the Luzon lived outside the Fort walls and bore the brunt of the attacks from the Moro warriors. The Spaniards call the Sultan of Sulu&#x27;s army Moros, Spanish for &quot;Moors&quot;, the word Moor was in turn derived from Morocco a North African country adjacent to Spain, and peopled by Muslims who conquered and ruled Al Andalus Spain for 800 years.

Half of the Zamboanga peninsula was made into a Corregimiento (district) de Zamboanga with its jurisdiction reaching as far as Sindangan to the north and the whole of Basilan island to the south, while the northern half of the peninsula belonged to the District of Misamis. In 1837, the government was changed to a Gobierno Militar. Zamboanga was made the capital of Mindanao throughout the Spanish regime, except for the period between 1872 and 1875, when the government was at Kutawato/ Cotabato.

====Jesuit expulsion====

In the meantime, the Jesuits were expelled from Portugal, France, the Two Sicilies, Parma and the Spanish Empire in 1768. Jesuit missions were very controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the natives and slavery. It is partly because the Jesuits protected the natives whom mainly it wanted to convert to Catholism that certain Spanish and Portuguese colonizers wanted to enslave that the Society of Jesus was eventually suppressed. The Recoletos de San Jose (Recollects) took over territories previously assigned to the Jesuits.

In 1755, a contingent of 1,900 men led by captains Simeon Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo to avenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din. But were roundly defeated again. In 1775, after Moro raid on Zamboanga, Capitan Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo but was also repulsed.

Throughout this brief period, however, Catholic missionaries continued their avid proselytization, converting very hard the clans of Subanen, Samals, Yakans and Tausugs to Catholicism, adding to the growing Visayan populations brought in primarily from Cebu and Panay.

====The French blockade====
By the 1840s, colonial interests other than Spanish focused over western Mindanao, particularly the territories under the Sulu sultanate. The British, French, Germans, and Americans all became interested in these rich islands.

In 1843, the French Foreign Minister François Guizot sent a fleet to Vietnam under Admiral Cécille and Captain Charner, which started the French intervention in Vietnam. The move responded to the successes of the British in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext, however, was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam. The fleet, accompanied by the diplomat Lagrene, tried to seize the island of Basilan in order to create a base similar to Hong Kong, but projects had to be abandoned following the strong opposition of Spain claiming the island was part of the Philippines.

When the French under Admiral Cécille blockaded Basilan in 1844–45, an island which they called Taguime, intent on establishing a network of naval stations to protect French trade in the area, the Spanish governor protested that Basilan had recognized Spain&#x27;s sovereignty just the year before, in February 1844. The French then forced the Basilan datus to sign a document affirming the &quot;absolute independence of Basilan vis-a-vis Spain&quot; on January 13, 1845, aboard the steamer Archimede.
On February 20, 1845, France forced the Sulu Sultan to formally cede Basilan Island to France in exchange for 100,000 piastres or 500,000 French francs. The French Admiral totally ignored Spanish protests. However, the inhabitants of Pasangen who remained loyal to Spain, fought against the French for a year, forcing the French King, Louis Philippe, also a Bourbon, to ultimately decide against taking Basilan although the French Cabinet already approved the annexation, even allocating the budget for Basilan for that year.

France&#x27;s claims on Basilan were based on a formal cession from the Sultan of Sulu as well as formal written agreement from the Basilan datus. These claims were eventually withdrawn by France, formalized in a proclamation dated August 5, 1845, turning over full sovereignty of the island to Spain. During the same year, a US survey mission studied the potentials of the Sulu archipelago, but U.S. intervention did not start until 1899.

====Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda====
After two centuries of incessant and unrelenting raids and counter-raids, the fortunes of the Spanish Empire in the Sulu Archipelago took a dramatic turn for the better in 1848, primarily due to three watershed events: the advent of Spain&#x27;s steam-powered naval superiority over Sulu&#x27;s outrigger-and-sail paraws; the fall of Sulu&#x27;s Balangingi allies on Tungkil; and, the establishment of Fuerte Isabel Segunda or Fort Isabella Segunda on Basilan Island. These three benchmarks sparked off a series of events which, from 1848 on, saw Sulu&#x27;s power wane until it was finally blighted and almost completely snuffed out on the eve of the American occupation.

To check the inroads of both the increasingly bloody Tausug pirate raids and the growing influence of Lamitan&#x27;s Yakan kingdom, as well as to thwart any further attempt by other European powers to colonize Basilan (the Dutch in 1747 and the French in 1844) the Spanish commandery in Zamboanga City sent over an expeditionary force tasked at establishing Spanish fortifications on Basilan island, both to serve as an early beacon and defensive perimeter against the pirate parties, and as a trading post for Spanish interests on the island.

In 1845, Don Ramon Lobo, the Marine Chief of Zamboanga, accompanied Don Cayetano Suarez de Figueroa, District Governor of Zamboanga, to the coastal settlement of Pasangen. Wooden fortifications were initially erected on the settlement&#x27;s highest point facing the narrow channel about 800 meters from the shore. The 200-year-old Jesuit mission was situated halfway between the fort and the shore. The fortification proved to be easily defensible as nearby Malamawi Island blocked direct attacks and raids from the sea. Later that same year, Governor Narciso Claveria ordered the construction of a stone fort, following the plan of engineer Emilio Bernaldez submitted in 1844. Construction lasted four years.

By 1848, the stone fort was finished, replacing the wooden fortifications. In the meantime, a sizeable and growing Christian settlement continued to flourish around the Recollect mission, rededicated since the expulsion of the Jesuits, to St Isabel de Portugal (Elizabeth of Portugal). The Fort thus established was subsequently named in honor of Queen Isabella II of Spain and the Indies, and was named Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda. The military garrison was initially placed under the direct command of the Fuerza de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragosa (Fort Pilar) in Zamboanga.

Nieto Aguilar (1894) describes the fort as &quot;magnificent.&quot; Situated 20 meters above sea level, the fortification overlooked the two entrances to the bay, formed by Basilan and Malamawi Island. To the fort&#x27;s east were the barracks. The fort had four bastions at the corner of its rectangular perimeter. It enclosed a well and had four structures for the corps of guards, the garrison personnel, the presidio, jail, artillery corps and the &quot;casa comandancia&quot;.

In the fort was the governor&#x27;s residence as well as that of his officials. It was also a naval station where the navy maintained small workshops for urgent repairs. It had a storehouse for coal near the shore. Total personnel: two officers, 50 men.

Outside the fort were built other structures, namely: a military infirmary, school, ayuntamiento (city hall), corps of engineers’ building, storehouses and dependencies of the naval station, barracks for the marine infantry, gunpowder storehouse, and the Jesuit church and convent.

On July 30, 1859, a royal decree was issued allowing the Jesuits to recover their Missions in Mindanao from the Recollects. The Jesuits finally returned to Basilan and Tetuan in 1862.

By 1863, Fort Isabela Segunda became the focal point of the 6th District of the Police-Military Government of Mindanao. And in 1879, the Spanish garrison built a &quot;floating&quot; Naval Hospital on shallows guarding the eastern entrance to the Isabela Channel.

The fort and naval hospital were demolished in the 20th century, when they were reduced to rubble by American bombs during World War II. The Basilan provincial capitol presently occupies the site of the demolished fort. Recent site excavations yielded rusted cannonballs and other late 19th- and early 20th-century paraphernalia in caverns dug deep beneath the former fort.

====American regime====
By 1898, Basilan Island was administratively divided into three districts, the Spanish-controlled towns of Isabela and Lamitan, and the Tausug trading outpost in Maluso, which the Sulu Sultanate handed-over to Spain, subsequent to the razing and occupation of Jolo by the Spanish from 1876 up to 1899, formalized by the Treaty of 1878.

Spain ceded its claim over the Philippine islands to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish–American War. Following the American occupation of the northern Philippine Islands during 1899, Spanish forces in Mindanao were cut off, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and Jolo. American forces relieved the Spanish at Zamboanga on May 18, 1899, and at Jolo and Basilan in December 1899.

====American occupation====

On December 8, 1899, American troops took over the Spanish garrison in Zamboanga, one of the last strongholds of the Filipino revolutionaries in Mindanao. By December 1899, the Americans led by Col. James S. Petit occupied the Spanish naval base of Isabela de Basilan. In Basilan, an increasingly old and sickly Datu Kalun (Pedro Cuevas) supported the new colonizers. Sovereignty over both Isabela and Lamitan then was effectively transferred from Spain to the Americans.

At that time, the Philippine–American War was raging in Luzon. So as not to spread out their forces, the Americans employed the classic divide-and-rule tactic. Maj. Gen. E.S. Otis, commander-in-chief of the US Forces, sent Gen. Bates to negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu. Known as the Bates treaty, the agreement provided for the exercise of American authority over the Sulu archipelago in exchange for the recognition of Muslim culture and religion. However this was contrasted by the Republic of Zamboanga which claimed sovereignty over the whole of Mindanao, which El Presidente Isidoro Midel and Datu Mandi briefly ruled. A place where religious freedom was practiced and interbaptism and syncretism common.

The Bates Treaty of 1899 between Sulu Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and American Brigadier General John C. Bates, further acknowledged American administrative control over the Sulu Archipelago, including Basilan.

Initially, Sultan Kiram was disappointed by the hand-over of control to the Americans and had expected to regain sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago after the defeat of the Spanish. Bates&#x27; main goal though, was to guarantee the Sultanate&#x27;s neutrality in the Philippine–American War, and to establish order in Mindanao. After some negotiations, the Bates Treaty was signed.

This treaty was based on the earlier Spanish treaty, and it retained the translation discrepancy: the English version described a complete dependency, while the Tausug version described a protectorate. Although the Bates Treaty granted more powers to the Americans than the original Spanish treaty, the treaty was still criticised in the United States for granting too much autonomy to the Sultan. One particular clause, which recognized the Moro practice of slavery, also raised eyebrows in Washington, D.C. Bates later admitted that the treaty was merely a stop-gap measure, signed only to buy time until the war in the north was ended and more forces could be brought to bear in the south.

The peace created by the Bates Treaty did not last, however. This became evident when the Muslims repudiated the Moro province, a politico-military government in Mindanao lasting from 1903 to 1914, and the Moro Rebellion soon broke out. It is important to note that barely two months before the creation of the Moro province, the American colonial government declared and classified all unoccupied lands as public lands. Immediately after the declaration, American investments entered Mindanao and mass migration of Christians was encouraged. (Rodil 1985:4).

The American forces eventually arrived under the command of Capt. Wendell C. Neville, who eventually became a Major General, the 14th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps in 1929–1930. He was initially posted as Military Governor of Basilan from 1899 to 1901, and was tasked at the establishment of a civil government for the island of Basilan.

By July 1, 1901, the Municipality of Zamboanga was inaugurated under Public Act No. 135. This constituted Zamboanga and Basilan Island.
On September 15, 1911, the governing body of the Moro Province, the Legislative Council, passed Act. No.272 converting the Municipality of Zamboanga into a city with a Commission form of government. The ceremony was held on January 1, 1912, with the appointment of American Christopher F. Bader as the first City Mayor. With the island of Basilan as part of Zamboanga, this made the City of Zamboanga the biggest city in the world in terms of land area. Two years later he was succeeded by Victoriano Tarrosas the first Filipino Zamboangueño Mayor of the city when Bader resigned.

The Department of Mindanao and Sulu replaced the Moro Province in 1914, and its districts broken up into separate provinces, namely: Davao, Misamis, Lanao, Cotabato, Sulu, and Zamboanga, the city was then reverted to its original status as a municipality administered by a Municipal President and several Councilors. The municipality included the whole of Basilan Island and it remained as the capital of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, with a civil government under an American civil governor, from 1913 up to 1920.

The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Frank W. Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920, by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began.

Datu Kalun died in Basilan on July 16, 1904, at the age of 58, soon after his first contact with the Americans. His nephew Gabino Pamaran became his successor and adopted the name Datu Mursalun. Mursalun, also pro-American, led the town of Lamitan which became an American model of civil government and development. Mursalun worked for the material progress of Basilan, and sought ways to fight banditry and piracy in the area.

====Philippine Commonwealth====
Politically, Basilan became a part of the Moro Province (1899–1914, encompassing most of Mindanao Island). Basilan was then included in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1914–1920), a district of Zamboanga Province (1920–1936), and then of the Chartered City of Zamboanga (1936–1948), before it became a Chartered City on its own right at the beginning of the Philippine Republic.

Alongside military suppression came a policy of education. Public schools were built but Muslim enrollment was way below Christian school attendance. Muslims considered public education a threat to their culture and religion.
To ensure Muslim participation in government affairs, the Americans soon adopted a Policy of Attraction for western Mindanao. Moreover, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) replaced the United States Army units pursuant to colonial efforts to reduce American presence. The replacement of American troops, mostly by Christians under the PC, increased the hostility between Muslims and Christians.

In the political sphere, the management of Muslim affairs through the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914 was unsuccessful, as leadership in the department fell in the hands of Christians. Thus, the Muslim leaders were historically opposed to the idea of independence, which meant the incorporation of Muslim areas into a political system dominated by Christians.

Early in the American period, American plantation owners cleared vast expanses of Basilan&#x27;s virgin forest land and established what was to be Basilan&#x27;s primary economic activity - plantation agriculture, mainly rubber and copra. American Dr. James D. W. Strong, the Father of the Philippine Rubber Industry, inaugurated the first rubber plantation in the Philippines (inauguration was attended by President Manuel L. Quezon no-less) in Baluno, a plaque and shrine to this pioneering individual may be visited in the same Barangay to this day.

The success of what was soon to be the B. F. Goodrich rubber concession in the northern part of Isabela City, enticed other multi-national firms, such as the British-Malaysian Sime Darby and the Hispano-German Hans Menzi Corporation to open rubber plantations in the city&#x27;s southern areas. The first Filipino-owned plantation was established on Malamawi Island by Don Juan S. Alano, originally of Malolos, Bulacan, who served as Representative of the entire Moro Province (Mindanao) during the Commonwealth Era (1936–1942), and the first Congressman of Zamboanga Province (now comprising Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan) in the Republic&#x27;s first Congress (1946–1949). He authored the Charter of both the Cities of Basilan and Zamboanga.

More Filipino settler families, such as the Cuevas-Flores-Pamaran-Antonio clan (progeny of the legendary Datu Kalun) in Lamitan and the Pardo, Barandino, Brown, Dans, Golveo, and Nuñal families of Isabela itself soon followed suit, establishing sizeable plantations, usually engaged in coconut/copra production.

====World War II====

The outbreak of World War II disrupted Commonwealth administration. In 1942 Japanese soldiers landed in Basilan and occupied it until 1945.

Christians and Muslim officers and men of the military district in Mindanao and Sulu shifted to the Moro guerilla activities against the Japanese. A civil government called Free Sulu Government administered activities in the locality.

The Japanese Occupation forces established a government in Basilan to govern both Zamboanga and Basilan. The Japanese Occupation of Basilan was rather uneventful, however, it barely affected the residents, except in terms of Japanese demand for food for their military machinery. In fact, Datu Mursalun and his family watched, without much interest, the American bombings of the Spanish fort and naval hospital in Isabela which signaled the retaking of Basilan by joint Filipino and American troops in 1945.

Alongside the Zamboanga operation, smaller units of the Military Forces of the Philippine Commonwealth and the Soldiers of the U.S. 41st Division invaded the Sulu Archipelago, a long stretch of islands reaching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to North Borneo. Rapidly taken in succession were Basilan, Malamawi, Tawi-Tawi, Sanga Sanga and Bongao. It is during this phase of the operations when American bombing raids completely destroyed Fort Isabela Segunda, which was used by the Japanese as military headquarters, prison and munitions dump, and razed the &quot;Spanish&quot; Naval Hospital. Minimal resistance from entrenched Japanese positions in Isabela and Malamawi Island brought about a quick reoccupation which was completed by the beginning of April. On April 9, strong resistance at Jolo was encountered. Anchoring their stubborn defense around Mount Dabo, some 3,900 Japanese troops held off the U.S. 163rd Infantry supported by Filipino soldiers and other local Moro guerrillas. By April 22, the Allies took the position after hard fighting and the rest of the troops fled and held out in the west for another two months. The 163rd suffered 40 dead and 125 wounded by mid-June 1945, while some 2,000 Japanese perished.

===Philippine Republic===
When the town of Zamboanga became a chartered city in 1936, it included Basilan. On July 1, 1948, by virtue of a bill filed by then-Congressman Juan S. Alano, Basilan itself became a separate city after Republic Act. No. 288 was passed by the 1st Philippine Congress to separate the island from the Zamboanga mainland as a separate entity, which was justified owing to the distance between the island and the city of Zamboanga.

The first city mayor was Nicasio S. Valderroza, appointed by President Elpidio Quirino. He was considered a builder of cities, having been variously a Provincial Treasurer, an acting Provincial Governor of the old Province of Zamboanga, Mayor of Baguio, first Mayor of Zamboanga City, First Mayor of Davao City and the first appointed Mayor of the new City of Basilan.

When President Ramon Magsaysay became president of the Republic in 1954, he appointed Leroy S. Brown as mayor of Basilan City. He served as the second and the last appointive mayor of this city until December 31, 1955. The city was then classified as a first class city.

With the approval of Republic Act. No. 1211 amending the charter of the City of Basilan, the position of the City Mayor became elective.

The first election for local officials in Basilan was held on November 8, 1955. Mayor Brown was overwhelmingly elected as the first elective mayor of the city, serving for 5 terms. The then Isabela district, being the city center, was the site for many city public works projects that gave way to an era of economic growth.

He was the first and the last elected city executive of Basilan. He served uninterrupted from January 1954 to December 31, 1975, under the Administrations of Presidents Carlos P. Garcia, Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand Marcos. During his term, the city council gave birth to a new breed of legislators and leaders from 1954 to 1975. These years have since been called Basilan&#x27;s &quot;Golden Years&quot;.

=== Municipality of Isabela ===

On September 21, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in the country. At that time, Basilan was in the middle of the Moro National Liberation Front Uprising prompted by the expose of the Jabidah Massacre on March 18, 1968. A number of native Moro leaders joined the MNLF rebellion, making Basilan a veritable warzone. The first-ever armed confrontation occurred around the heavily forested hills of Bagbagon and Canibungan in Lantawan on the island&#x27;s western area. This was followed by the occupation of the Alano Plantation (declared &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; by the military) by MNLF &quot;munduhin&quot; and &quot;blackshirts&quot; and the ensuing aerial bombardment by the military which left the plantation totally devastated. MNLF rebels then laid siege over Lamitan&#x27;s poblacion, but was eventually staved off by fierce resistance from Lamitan residents who volunteered to fight valiantly beside elements of the Armed Forces and the Philippine Constabulary.

Several more raids and ambushes were made throughout the island, which succeeded in stopping all the operations of the plantations. Sporadic gun-battles, too, broke out within Isabela&#x27;s poblacion, and pirate raids harried fishing operations as well as passenger ferry traffic between Basilan and Zamboanga.

After more than two years of incessant fighting, a substantial number among Basilan&#x27;s Christian populace left the place altogether reducing the Christian tribes to minority status once again. After nearly 50 years of continuous immigration from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon, Basilan experienced, for the very first time, a net outflow of people.

On December 27, 1973, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 356, converting the City of Basilan into the Province of Basilan &quot;to provide the close government attention and for the purpose of spurring its growth&quot;. Another Presidential Decree numbered 593 dated December 2, 1974, amended P.D. 356. The law not only defines the city&#x27;s territory but also provided that the capital of Basilan shall be the Municipality of Isabela. It also created ten Municipalities to comprise the new Province of Basilan.

Presidential Decree No. 593 was later amended by Presidential Decree No. 840 dated December 11, 1975, reducing the number of municipalities to seven in order to render its &quot; territorial portion more complementary to the size of the area and more responsive to pacification, rehabilitation and total development of the province&quot;. The municipalities specified in the said amendment were the following: Isabela, Lamitan, Tuburan, Tipo-Tipo, Sumisip, Maluso and Lantawan, of which five municipalities are now in existence. It also provided for the absorption of the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Basilan into the Municipality of Isabela with its poblacion as the capital seat of the province.
The conversion into a province, and the creation of municipalities ensured that Basilan&#x27;s sparsely populated areas were &quot;given&quot; to Muslim warlords and surrendering MNLF Commanders by Presidential fiat, as a form of bounty or reward for laying down their arms. The once-progressive First-Class City of Basilan was emasculated beyond recognition, having been reduced to an area exactly One-Kilometer radius within the Isabela Poblacion.

Under martial law, Basilan had its first military governor in the person of Col. Tomas G. Nanquil Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan. There were three vice governors during his tenure as military governor. Col. Nanquil served for about a year and half.

Before Basilan was converted to a province, it had three regular municipalities, Isabela, Lamitan, and Maluso which are districts of the city of Basilan. Even when Col. Nanquil was appointed Military Governor, the city of Basilan was still functioning under Mayor Brown until December 31, 1975, due to its territorial boundary dispute with the Province of Basilan.

The second military Governor was Rear Admiral Romulo M. Espaldon. Due to his numerous functions and responsibilities as Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines&#x27; Southern Command (SouthCom), South Sulu Sea Frontiers Command, overall military supervisor of Mindanao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFP and Regional Commissioner for Islamic Affairs in Region IX, Adm. Espaldon could not possibly attend to his duties as Military Governor of Basilan. To this effect, he designated Col. Florencio Magsino, Brigade Commander of the 21st Infantry Brigade as Military Supervisor for Basilan and Officer-In-Charge. His Deputy Brigade Commander Col. Recaredo Calvo ably assisted Col. Magsino. When Col. Magsino was appointed Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in Baguio and Col. Calvo was recalled to Headquarters, Col. Alfredo Rillera assumed command of the Brigade and became the Military Supervisor of Basilan. He was succeeded by Col. Salvador Mison. Col. Augusto Narag Jr., later replaced him. The last military Supervisor was Gen. Rodolfo Tolentino, consequently, the first military with a star rank to be appointed Military Supervisor in Basilan. Admiral Espaldon was the last military governor of the province, his term lasted until December 31, 1975.

On December 11, 1975, President Marcos appointed then Vice Governor for Administration Asan G. Camlian, a thrice-elected City Councilor, which later led to the appointment of Ricardo G. Mon as the first municipal mayor of now reinstated municipal government of Isabela. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1976, Isabela, therefore, regained independence as the capital town of Basilan province.

====City of Isabela====

By virtue of Republic Act No. 9023 Isabela was granted cityhood, with said grant having been ratified by Isabela&#x27;s residents on a plebiscite held April 25, 2001. Isabela&#x27;s first city mayor then was Luis Rubio Biel II, the sitting municipal mayor elected in 1998.

In November of the same year, Isabela City&#x27;s residents roundly rejected inclusion into the expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), and have since remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the Zamboanga Peninsula region. The rest of Basilan&#x27;s six municipalities were promptly inducted into the ARMM.

The elevation of Isabela to 4th-class city status gave the local government a much-needed boost, efficiently delivered under the Biel administration, revitalized Isabela City, making it an engine of growth for Basilan province even as the hinterlands was wracked by incessant firefights and gun-battles between the military and bandit groups such as the Abu Sayyaf and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).

This renewed vigor was cut-short when Biel was assassinated at high noon on March 3, 2006, by a lone gunman as he was about to leave City Hall. Isabela City residents mourned the loss of the slain Mayor in what probably is the biggest funeral procession ever seen in Basilan.

Isabela City then came under the short-lived administration of Vice Mayor Rodolfo Y. Tan, who served the remainder of Biel&#x27;s term, relinquishing his post after having been defeated in the May 2007 local elections.

From June 2007 – 2016, Isabela City has been under the administration of Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar, who at 32 years, is one of the youngest Mayors of Isabela, and is the first woman to hold the post. She is one of the widows of slain Congressman Wahab Akbar, a 3-term Governor of Basilan. Akbar&#x27;s first-wife was the incumbent Governor, while then-Mayor Akbar (now vice mayor) is the late strongman&#x27;s second-wife.

Isabela City under then-Mayor Akbar figured prominently in the Anti-MOA/AD movement which was cobbled up in August 2008, when the Philippine Government Peace Negotiating Panel and the MILF was about to sign a landmark deal which would have granted the MILF a &quot;separate, distinct and exclusive&quot; Ancestral Domain and a semi-independent government, dubbed the Bangsamoro Juridical Entity (BJE). Indignation rallies in the Cities of Zamboanga and Iligan, as well as elsewhere in Mindanao were joined by protest actions staged by Isabela City residents, rejecting the proposed deal with the MILF.

In 2017, the capital was transferred from Isabela to Lamitan. Isabela still remains part of Basilan provincial services but regional services remain in Zamboanga Peninsula instead of ARMM where the province of Basilan belongs.

<text>Scotty Maurice Pippen Sr. (born September 25, 1965), usually spelled Scottie Pippen, is an American former professional basketball player. He played 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Considered one of the greatest small forwards of all time, Pippen played an important role in transforming the Bulls into a championship team and popularizing the NBA around the world during the 1990s.

Pippen was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team eight consecutive times and the All-NBA First Team three times. He was a seven-time NBA All-Star and was the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1994. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History during the season, and is one of four players to have his jersey retired by the Chicago Bulls (the others being Jerry Sloan, Bob Love, and Michael Jordan). He played a main role on both the 1992 Chicago Bulls Championship team and the 1996 Chicago Bulls Championship team, which were selected as two of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History. His biography on the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame&#x27;s website states that &quot;the multidimensional Pippen ran the court like a point guard, attacked the boards like a power forward, and swished the nets like a shooting guard.&quot; During his 17-year career, he played 12 seasons with the Bulls, one with the Houston Rockets and four with the Portland Trail Blazers, making the postseason 16 consecutive times. In October 2021, Pippen was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Pippen is one of the only two NBA players to have won an NBA title and Olympic gold medal in the same year twice (the other one is Jrue Holiday), having done so in both 1992 and 1996. He was a part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic &quot;Dream Team&quot; which beat its opponents by an average of 44 points. He was also a key figure in the 1996 Olympic team, alongside former &quot;Dream Team&quot; members Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, and David Robinson, as well as newer faces such as Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Anfernee &quot;Penny&quot; Hardaway and Grant Hill. He wore the number 8 during both years.

Pippen is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once for his individual career and once as a member of the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, having been simultaneously inducted for both on August 13, 2010. The Bulls retired his number 33 on December 8, 2005. The University of Central Arkansas retired his number 33 on January 21, 2010.

He was formerly married to television personality Larsa Pippen, and is the father of basketball player Scotty Pippen Jr.

==Early life==
Pippen was born in Hamburg, Arkansas, to Ethel (1923–2016) and Preston Pippen (1920–1990). He has 11 older siblings. His mother was tall and his father was , and all of their children were tall, with Scottie Pippen being the tallest. His parents could not afford to send their other children to college. His father worked in a paper mill until suffering from a stroke that paralyzed his right side, prevented him from walking, and affected his speech. Six year prior: Pippen&#x27;s second-oldest brother also became paralyzed after an injury in a high school PE class. Pippen attended Hamburg High School. Playing point guard, he led his team to the state playoffs and earned all-conference honors as a senior, but was not offered any college scholarships.

==College career==
Pippen began his college playing career at the University of Central Arkansas after being discovered by the school&#x27;s head basketball coach, Don Dyer, as a walk-on. He did not receive much media coverage because Central Arkansas played in the NAIA, while the media focused on the more prestigious NCAA. Pippen stood only tall when he graduated from high school, but experienced a growth spurt while at Central Arkansas and grew to . As a senior, his per game averages of 23.6 points, 10 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and near 60 percent field goal shooting earned him consensus NAIA All-American honors in 1986 and 1987, making him a dominant player in the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference, drawing the attention of NBA scouts.

==Professional career==

=== Chicago Bulls (1987–1998) ===

====Early career (1987–1990)====
Having eyed Pippen before the 1987 NBA draft, the Chicago Bulls manufactured a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics that sent Pippen, selected fifth overall, to the Bulls in exchange for the eighth pick, Olden Polynice, and future draft pick options. Pippen became part of Chicago&#x27;s young forward duo with power forward Horace Grant (the 10th overall pick in 1987), although both came off the bench during their rookie seasons. Pippen made his NBA debut on November 7, 1987, when the Chicago Bulls opened against the Philadelphia 76ers. He finished with 10 points, two steals, four assists, and one rebound in 23 minutes of play, and the Bulls won 104–94.

With teammate Michael Jordan as a motivational and instructional mentor, Pippen refined his skills and slowly developed many new ones over his career. Jordan and Pippen frequently played one-on-one outside of team practices, simply to hone each other&#x27;s skills on offense and defense. Pippen claimed the starting small forward position during the 1988 NBA Playoffs, helping the Jordan-led Bulls to reach the conference semifinals for the first time in over a decade. Pippen emerged as one of the league&#x27;s premier young forwards at the turn of the decade, recording then-career highs in points (16.5 points per game), rebounds (6.7 rebounds per game), and field goal shooting (48.9%), as well as finishing third in the league in steals with 211 during the 1989–1990 season. These feats earned Pippen his debut NBA All-Star selection in 1990.

Pippen continued to improve as the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1989 and 1990. In each season, the Bulls were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons. In the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals, Pippen suffered a severe migraine headache at the start of Game Seven that impacted his play, and he made only one of his ten field goal attempts as the Bulls lost 93–74.

====The Bulls&#x27; first three-peat (1991–1993)====
In the 1990–91 NBA season, Pippen emerged as the Bulls&#x27; primary defensive stopper and a versatile scoring threat in Phil Jackson&#x27;s triangle offense. Alongside the help of Jordan, Pippen continued to improve his game, especially in shooting from the field. He had his first triple-double on November 23 when the Bulls faced the Los Angeles Clippers as he had 13 points, 12 assists and 13 rebounds in 30 minutes in a 105–97 win. The Bulls finished the season with a record of 61–21. They were first in the Central Division, first in the Eastern Conference and second overall, as the Portland Trail Blazers clinched the first spot. Pippen was second on the team in points per game with 17.8 and steals with 2.4 next to Jordan and he was also second in rebounds per game with 7.3 next to Horace Grant. Pippen led the team in blocks per game with 1.1 and assists per game with 6.2. He ranked fifth overall in the NBA in steals, both for total steals and steals per game. For his efforts in the 1990–91 NBA season Pippen was awarded NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors. The Bulls went on to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals.

Pippen helped lead the Bulls to their first three-peat, as they won the following two years in and .

====Pippen without Jordan (1993–1995)====
Michael Jordan retired before the 1993–94 season and in his absence Pippen emerged from Jordan&#x27;s shadow. That year, he earned All-Star Game MVP honors and led the Bulls in scoring, assists, and blocks, and was second in the NBA in steals per game, averaging 22.0 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 2.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game, while shooting 49.1% from the field and a career-best 32% from the 3-point line. For his efforts, he earned the first of three straight All-NBA First Team selections, and he finished third in MVP voting. The Bulls (with key additions of Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley) finished the season with 55 wins, only two fewer than the year before.

However, one of the most controversial moments of Pippen&#x27;s career came in his first year without Jordan. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the New York Knicks, whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2–0 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for Toni Kukoč, with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls&#x27; leader all season long in Jordan&#x27;s absence, was so angered by Jackson&#x27;s decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Although Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court. &quot;Scottie asked out of the play,&quot; Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview.

A key play occurred in Game 5 which changed the outcome of the series. With 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the Knicks&#x27; Hubert Davis attempted a shot which was defended by Pippen, who was called for a personal foul by referee Hue Hollins, who determined that Pippen made contact with Davis. Television replays indicated that contact was made after Davis had released the ball. Davis successfully made both free throw attempts to assist in the Knicks victory, 87–86, and gave the Knicks a three games to two advantage in the series. The resulting incident was described as the most controversial moment of Hollins&#x27; career by &quot;Referee&quot; magazine. Hollins defended the call after the game saying, &quot;I saw Scottie make contact with his shooting motion. I&#x27;m positive there was contact on the shot.&quot; Darell Garretson, the league&#x27;s supervisor of officials and who also officiated in the league, agreed with Hollins and issued a statement, &quot;The perception is that referees should put their whistles in their pockets in the last minutes. But it all comes down to what is sufficient contact. There&#x27;s an old, old adage that refs don&#x27;t make those calls in the last seconds. Obviously, you hope you don&#x27;t make a call that will decide a game. But the call was within the context of how we had been calling them all game.&quot; Garretson later changed his stance of the call the next season. Speaking to a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter, Garretson described Hollins&#x27; call as &quot;terrible&quot;. Chicago head coach Phil Jackson, upset over the outcome of the game, was fined $10,000 for comparing the loss to the gold medal game controversy at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

In Game 6, Pippen made the signature play of his career. Midway in the third quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing&#x27;s hand in his face. Pippen landed several feet away from the basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls&#x27; lead to 17; they won 93–79.

In Game 7, Pippen scored 20 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, but the Bulls still lost 87–77. The Knicks then proceeded to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Houston Rockets, also in seven games.

Trade rumors involving Pippen escalated during the 1994 off-season. Jerry Krause, the Bulls&#x27; general manager, was reportedly looking to ship Pippen off to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for all-star forward Shawn Kemp, moving Toni Kukoč into Pippen&#x27;s position as starting small forward with Kemp filling in the vacant starting power forward position in place of Horace Grant, a free agent who left the Bulls for the up-and-coming Orlando Magic during the off-season. In January, when asked by Craig Sager as to whether he thought that he would be traded, Pippen replied, &quot;I hope I am&quot;. However, Pippen would remain a Bull and those rumors were put to rest once it was announced that Michael Jordan would be returning to the Bulls, late in the season. Badly lacking interior defense and rebounding due to Grant&#x27;s departure, the Pippen-led Bulls did not play as well in the 1994 season as they had in the season before. For the first time in years, they were in danger of missing the playoffs. The Bulls were just 34–31, prior to Jordan&#x27;s return for the final 17 games, and Jordan led them to a 13–4 record to close the regular season. Still, Pippen finished the 1994 season leading the Bulls in every major statistical category—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks—joining Dave Cowens () as the only players in NBA history to accomplish the feat; Kevin Garnett (), LeBron James (), Giannis Antetokounmpo () and Nikola Jokić () have since matched it.

====The Bulls&#x27; second three-peat (1996–1998)====
With the return of Michael Jordan and the addition of multiple-time NBA rebound leader Dennis Rodman, the Bulls posted the best regular-season record in NBA history at the time (72–10) in (later surpassed in by the Golden State Warriors) en route to winning their fourth title against the Seattle SuperSonics. Later that year, Pippen became the first person to win an NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics.

The Bulls opened the 1996–97 NBA season with a 17–1 record and had a league-best record of 42–6 when entering the All-Star break. In November 1996, Pippen set the NBA single-month plus-minus record of 272. Both Pippen and Jordan were selected among the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History as part of the league celebrating its 50th season. The ceremony was held at half-time of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, which took place on February 9, 1997. Phil Jackson, the Bulls&#x27; head coach, was honored as one of the 10 greatest coaches in NBA history, while the 1992 Chicago Bulls Championship team and the 1996 Chicago Bulls Championship team, on which Pippen had played a key role, were selected as two of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History. In the All-Star game itself, Pippen was 4–9 from the field, finishing with 8 points as well as 3 rebounds and 2 assists in 25 minutes of play. The East defeat the West 132–120 and Glen Rice was crowned the All-Star Game MVP.

Pippen scored a career high of 47 points in a 134–123 win over the Denver Nuggets on February 18, going 19–27 from the field and adding 4 rebounds, 5 assists, and 2 steals in 41 minutes of play. On February 23 Pippen was voted &quot;Player of The Week&quot; for the week of February 17, his fifth and final time to receive that honor. As the league entered its final weeks the Bulls lost several of their key players, including Bill Wennington (ruptured tendon in his foot), Dennis Rodman (injured knee), and Toni Kukoč (inflamed sole on his foot). Pippen and Jordan were forced to shoulder a greater load while keeping the team headed towards a playoff appearance. Even with this challenge Chicago finished a league-best 69–13 record. In the final game of the regular season, Pippen missed a game-winning 3-pointer, leaving the Bulls just short of having an NBA record-setting back-to-back 70-win seasons. For his efforts in the 1996–97 NBA season, Pippen earned NBA All-Defensive First Team honors for the seventh consecutive time as well as All-NBA Second Team honors.

Despite injuring his foot in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, Pippen helped the Bulls to an 84–82 victory over the Utah Jazz in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, which was decided by Jordan&#x27;s game-winning buzzer beating jumper. One of the highlights of the game was when Jazz star Karl Malone was fouled by Dennis Rodman with 9.2 seconds left and had a chance to give Utah the lead and Pippen famously psyched Malone out, before he stepped up to the line, by saying: &quot;Just remember, the mailman doesn&#x27;t deliver on Sundays.&quot; He missed both free throws. Jordan got the rebound and quickly called a time-out with 7.5 seconds left. With play resumed, Jordan dribbled out most of the clock, then launched a shot that went in at the buzzer to give Chicago a 1–0 series lead. In Game 3 of the series, Pippen tied a then finals record of seven 3-pointers, but Chicago still lost 104–93. In Game 5, Jordan was battling illness but still managed to dominate the game, with the Bulls winning 90–88. With only seconds remaining and the outcome safely in Chicago&#x27;s favor; Jordan collapsed into Pippen&#x27;s arms, creating an iconic image of the pair that has come to symbolize &quot;The Flu Game&quot;. During Game 6, Pippen made one of the greatest plays of his career. Trailing by two, after Steve Kerr&#x27;s jump shot with 5 seconds remaining, the Jazz looked for a final shot to stay alive, but Pippen knocked away Bryon Russell&#x27;s inbound pass intended for Shandon Anderson and rolled the ball over to Toni Kukoč, who dunked to give the Bulls a 90–86 lead, clinching their fifth championship. Afterwards, Jordan was named Finals MVP for the fifth time.

The season began amid speculation that it would be the last in Chicago for Pippen, Jordan, and Jackson. Pippen had purposefully delayed off-season surgery so that his summer off-season would not be complicated by rehab, pushing his unavailability well into the regular season. In addition to this increasing the load on Jordan to drive the team towards a potential final championship together, it stirred an active effort by Bulls general manager Jerry Krause to trade Pippen, who responded in turn with his own trade demand and rancorous sit-out that extended well beyond his return to playing condition. In spite of this, Pippen ultimately rejoined the team, without any contract renegotiation to pay him what he was worth relative to the then league pay scale, and joined Jordan in another Bulls run to the 1998 NBA Finals, where they again bested the Jazz to win their second three-peat.

===Houston Rockets (1999)===
After eleven seasons with the Chicago Bulls, Pippen, the franchise&#x27;s second-place leader in points, assists, and steals, was traded in January 1999 in a sign-and-trade deal to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Roy Rogers and a second round pick in the 2000 NBA draft (Jake Voskuhl). Pippen&#x27;s trade to Houston for the lockout-shortened season received much publicity, including his only solo cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In order for the Rockets to create enough salary-cap room to acquire Pippen, Charles Barkley said that he sacrificed greatly as he signed a five-year $67.2 million contract before the previous season. Pippen&#x27;s salary was $11 million, almost four times what it had been the previous season with the Chicago Bulls.

Alongside Barkley, his former Olympic teammate and future NBA Hall of Famer, Pippen joined Hakeem Olajuwon, but on-court chemistry problems emerged, especially with Barkley. Pippen had his first triple-double in a 93–87 loss against the Atlanta Hawks as he had 15 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in addition to 1 steal in 46 minutes of play. On April 22, 1999, Pippen was detained by police on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. The charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence. Pippen had his second triple-double of the season in a 106–101 loss against the Los Angeles Clippers, posting 23 points, 10 assists, and 10 rebounds in addition to 6 steals in 45 minutes of play. Despite averaging a career-high in minutes per game with 40.2 and finishing 4th in the NBA in minutes played, Pippen&#x27;s scoring was down to 14.5 points per game, his lowest since his rookie year, and he made a career-low 43.2 percent of his shots. However, he also averaged his exceptional combination for a small forward of 6.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game, and was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team for the 8th time. The Rockets finished the season with a 31–19 record, third in the Midwest Division and fifth in the Western Conference. They faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. In game 3 of the series, Pippen scored 37 points and had 13 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1 block in staving off elimination. The Lakers went on to win the series the following game, defeating Houston 98–88.

Following the season&#x27;s end and the Rockets&#x27; early elimination from the playoffs, Pippen expressed a desire to be traded. Charles Barkley appeared on &quot;Up Close&quot; and openly criticized Pippen, saying, &quot;For him to want to leave after one year, it disappointed me greatly. The Rockets went out of their way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was just disappointed in him.&quot; Pippen responded by saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint. He can never expect an apology from me. If anything, he owes me an apology for coming to play with his fat butt.&quot; He stated that the main reasons for his departure were Barkley&#x27;s selfishness and his lack of desire to win. He also expressed the wish to play for his former coach Phil Jackson, who was now coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. Pippen said one of the reasons he wanted to play for Jackson was that he longed to return to the system in which they won six NBA titles together in Chicago. Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers on October 2, 1999, in exchange for Stacey Augmon, Kelvin Cato, Ed Gray, Carlos Rogers, Brian Shaw and Walt Williams.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1999–2003)===
Pippen claimed the starting small forward position with the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1999–2000 NBA season. Playing alongside new stars such as Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith, Pippen continued to demonstrate his defensive capabilities. On January 3, when the Trail Blazers faced the Bulls, Pippen was honored with a video tribute highlighting his best moments in his 11-year career with the Bulls. Pippen later commented on the tribute by saying, &quot;It was very emotional for me, but I tried to handle it as well as possible realizing I had a game to play. It was something that brought back a lot of memories for me, a lot of things I miss about this city, playing in this arena.&quot; Under head coach Mike Dunleavy, the Trail Blazers posted a 59–23 record and clinched the second spot in the Pacific Division and the third spot in the Western Conference. Pippen started in all 82 games that season, averaging 12.5 points per game, 5 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. In the first round of the 2000 NBA Playoffs, Portland defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3 games to 1. Their opponents in the second round were the Utah Jazz. In game 5, with Portland trailing by 2 points, Pippen hit a three pointer with 7.3 seconds remaining. The Jazz fouled Pippen on the next play, and he made one of two free throws to give the Blazers an 81–79 lead. The Trail Blazers won the series 4–1 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals. There, they faced the Los Angeles Lakers, coached by Phil Jackson, Pippen&#x27;s former coach in Chicago. The series stretched to a deciding game 7, in which the Trail Blazers held a 15-point lead in the 4th quarter. However, led by the All-Star duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, the Lakers managed to erase Portland&#x27;s lead and win the game 89–84 and with that also the series. In the game Pippen struggled, shooting only 30% from the field and totaling 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers proceeded to the 2000 NBA Finals where they faced the Indiana Pacers and were eventually crowned the NBA Champions.

In the 2000–01 NBA season, Pippen played 64 games, starting in 60 of them. He was forced to miss 18 games due to tendinitis in his right elbow, which was his shooting arm. Pippen started being bothered by minor injuries during December but still managed to play. His right arm stiffened after a game with the Boston Celtics on January 8. He missed the next six games, and after a two-point performance in a loss to the Sacramento Kings on January 20, the injury again became too painful for him. He had the elbow examined by several doctors before going into surgery. After undergoing a procedure to remove a bone fragment in his right elbow, he made his return on February 22 against the Utah Jazz and played for the remainder of the season. Pippen finished the season with averages of 11.3 points per game, 4.6 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. The Trail Blazers finished the season with a 50–32 record, fourth in the Pacific Division and seventh in the Western Conference. They were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the returning and eventual repeat champions, the Los Angeles Lakers.

Pippen played for two more seasons in Portland: the Trail Blazers made the playoffs both years, but were eliminated in the first round each time, in another sweep to the Lakers and in a 7-game series to the Mavericks, respectively. On February 3, 2003, by then 37 years old, Pippen willed the Trail Blazers to a win over the Orlando Magic with 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 7 assists.

===Return to Chicago (2003–2004)===
After the season, Pippen left Portland to sign with the Chicago Bulls, where he had begun his NBA career and won six championships. The Bulls&#x27; general manager John Paxson pursued Pippen to return to his old team, which had had little success following the breakup of the Bulls dynasty in 1998. The deal was made official on July 20, 2003, as Pippen signed a two-year, $10 million contract with the franchise. Pippen assumed a veteran role on the team in order to guide the young Bulls team, but was faced with numerous injuries throughout the season and was only able to play 23 games, averaging 5.9 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game. He played the final game of his NBA career against the Seattle SuperSonics on February 2, 2004, scoring two points, with one rebound and three assists in eight minutes of play in a 109–97 loss. The Bulls compiled a 23–59 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs. This marked the first time in Pippen&#x27;s career that his team did not reach the playoffs. Pippen had been a constant presence in the NBA playoffs prior to this season, reaching the playoffs in 16 straight years (11 with Chicago, 1 with Houston, 4 with Portland). He is second in the NBA in career playoff steals with 395 (LeBron James leads with 445). On October 5, 2004, Pippen announced his retirement.

The Chicago Bulls retired Pippen&#x27;s jersey number in a ceremony on December 9, 2005. The team played against the Los Angeles Lakers that night and Pippen was reunited with Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, and Horace Grant during the ceremony. Pippen&#x27;s 33 joined Michael Jordan&#x27;s 23, Bob Love&#x27;s 10, and Jerry Sloan&#x27;s 4 as the only numbers retired by the Bulls.

In 2007, Pippen had attempted to make an NBA comeback as he expressed that he would like to play for a championship contender in hopes of getting his 7th Championship ring. Pippen had spent the winter working out in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and announced that he was hoping for a late-season return to the league. Dwyane Wade, who was the Finals MVP of the 2006 NBA Finals and the captain of the returning champions, the Miami Heat, liked the idea of Pippen making a comeback and expressed his views on it: &quot;I&#x27;m already playing with Payton and Shaq, two guys I used to play with on video games. To add Scottie Pippen to the mix, that would be crazy.&quot;

=== Scandinavian comeback (2008) ===

In January 2008, Pippen made a brief comeback to professional basketball at age 42, when he made a tour of Scandinavia and played two games for top Finnish league team Torpan Pojat (ToPo), and top Swedish league team Sundsvall. In his first game, on January 4, Pippen scored 12 points in ToPo&#x27;s 93–81 win over Porvoo. He registered nine points and nine rebounds in a 98–85 win over Honka on January 5.

In his third game of the tour, Pippen registered 21 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and two steals in 30 minutes in a 102–74 Sundsvall Dragons win over Akropol of Rinkeby. The Dragons paid Pippen $66,000 for his appearance.

== National team career ==

On September 21, 1991, amongst nine other players (two more would be later selected), Pippen was announced as a member of the United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team which was set to represent the United States of America in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

In 1992, Pippen played on the original Dream Team which competed in the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. With the U.S. winning the gold medal, Pippen and teammate Michael Jordan became the first players to win both an NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year. He also played on the 1996 squad (nicknamed &#x27;Dream Team III&#x27;).

== Executive career ==
Pippen returned to the Bulls on July 15, 2010, as a team ambassador. In 2012, he was named senior advisor to Michael Reinsdorf, the Bulls&#x27; president and COO.

On April 16, 2020, Pippen stated that he had been dismissed as a public relations ambassador for the Bulls in February. According to NBC Sports Chicago, he and the Bulls could not come to an agreement on compensation and allowing him to keep his role of making regular TV appearances on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;The Jump&quot;. He quipped, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really want it to be out in the public but I&#x27;m no longer employed by the Bulls. Probably is a good thing, right? I like to associate myself with winning.&quot;

==Player profile==
Pippen was famed for his defensive abilities, having made the NBA All Defensive Team ten consecutive years during his career and leading the league in steals in . Jackson once described him as a &quot;one-man wrecking crew&quot;, capable of guarding anyone from the point guard to the center position. Pippen is one of three players in NBA history (along with Jordan and Olajuwon) to record 200 steals and 100 blocks in a season, and he has the record for second-most career steals in the playoffs (395) behind James. He was skilled at staying in front of his man on defense, and particularly effective as a help defender, with his long arms in traps. He was also capable of chasing down an opposing player in transition to block shots from behind.

On offense, Pippen relied primarily on his athleticism to gain an advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line to the basket. He favored shooting his jump shots—mid-range and three-pointers—on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot over the course of his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.

==Legacy==
Pippen is remembered as one of the greatest basketball defenders of all time as well as one of the most versatile and agile players overall. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time and named Pippen as the 32nd greatest player in NBA history. Much like fellow Bulls teammate Michael Jordan, he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, tough interior defense, and significant talent as a help defender. Gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even when compared with other professional athletes, Pippen demonstrated substantial skill in multiple areas well-suited for basketball.

Pippen&#x27;s unusually long arms (with a wingspan) and jumping agility helped him clog the passing lanes on defense, block shots from behind on players that had managed to pass him by, grab seemingly out-of-reach rebounds, make unusual plays in mid-air, and make passes around defenders that most players are physically unable to make. He often led the Bulls in assists and blocks as a result. He was also known as a selfless player, and his team-focused approach to the game was a key component in the Bulls&#x27; championship wins. His career assists total of 6,135 (5.2 per game), which was 23rd all-time among all players when he retired, is a testament to that approach.

Pippen&#x27;s intense work ethic and athletic physique gave him the ability to consistently make highlight-reel plays, such as applying defensive intensity, forcing a turnover, stealing the ball, and starting a one-man fast break that he would finish with a thunderous slam dunk. As he himself has attested, he and Jordan would compete to see who could force more turnovers and produce more offense from defense in each game (fast-break points). During the 1990 Slam Dunk Contest, Pippen exhibited his leaping ability with a dunk from the free-throw line. He was an athletic finisher at the rim, both with slam dunks and a skillful finger roll that he added to his skill set over time. He was also a prolific perimeter shooter for the time, taking about 3,000 and making almost 1,000 three-pointers in his career.

Several NBA players, including Jordan, Jason Kidd, and Karl Malone have placed Pippen in their all-time starting lineups.

In order to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their first NBA Championship in 1991, the Chicago Bulls organization honored the 1991 Chicago Bulls Championship team in a ceremony during halftime of a game versus the Utah Jazz on March 12, 2011. Pippen and Michael Jordan both attended and participated in the celebration, where they were reunited with their former teammates John Paxson, Horace Grant, Stacey King, Craig Hodges, Will Perdue, Scott Williams, Cliff Levingston, Dennis Hopson and Assistant Coach Johnny Bach. Former head coach Phil Jackson did not participate but gave a speech via a video message. Former Bulls&#x27; broadcaster Jim Durham emceed the halftime ceremony.

On March 17, 2011, the Chicago Bulls organization announced that they would honor Pippen with a bronze statue which will be placed inside of the Bulls&#x27; home arena, the United Center. He expressed his gratitude by saying: &quot;Words really can&#x27;t express my feelings. It&#x27;s something you dream of as a kid growing up, but you can never foresee those childhood fantasies becoming reality. You see statues of individuals who have done great things and made their mark on history, but as a basketball player, you never really think about arriving at this point. It&#x27;s an amazing honor for the Chicago Bulls to do this for me.&quot; The statue was unveiled on April 7, 2011, during a halftime ceremony of a game between the Chicago Bulls and the Boston Celtics.

==Personal life==

Although his given name is spelled &quot;Scotty&quot; on his birth certificate, Pippen usually goes by &quot;Scottie&quot;.

Pippen has been married twice. He married Karen McCollum in 1988. The couple had a son, Antron Pippen (1987 – 2021), before divorcing in 1990.

Pippen married Larsa Pippen, who later became a &quot;Real Housewives of Miami&quot; star, in 1997. The couple had four children: Scotty Jr., Preston, Justin, and Sophia. Though Pippen filed for divorce in 2016, he later withdrew his divorce petition. Larsa Pippen filed for divorce in 2018, and the divorce became final in late 2021. Scotty Pippen Jr. currently plays for the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA, and Sophia Pippen appeared on the first season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars: Juniors&quot;. Justin Pippen is also a basketball player, currently committed to play College Basketball at Michigan.

Pippen fathered twin daughters, Taylor and Tyler Roby, with his former girlfriend, Sonya Roby. The twins were born in 1994. Tyler Roby died nine days after birth.

Pippen also fathered a daughter with his former fiancée, Yvette De Leon. The child was born in 1995.

Pippen&#x27;s nephew, Kavion Pippen, has played basketball for the Long Island Nets.

Shortly after retiring, Pippen learned that his financial adviser Robert Lunn, who he claimed had been recommended by the Bulls, was under investigation for bank fraud. Pippen had invested over $20 million through Lunn, who was sentenced to three years in prison in March 2016 on multiple fraud counts; Lunn was found to have forged Pippen&#x27;s signature on a $1.4 million loan that Lunn used to pay off personal debts.

Pippen developed a reputation for being a poor tipper at restaurants, earning him the nickname &quot;No Tippin&#x27; Pippen&quot;.

===Legal issues===
On July 11, 2013, Camran Shafighi filed a $4 million lawsuit against Pippen in Los Angeles Superior Court over an incident that had occurred on June 23 at the restaurant Nobu in Malibu, California. Shafighi said that he was physically attacked by Pippen after taking pictures of Pippen inside and outside the restaurant, and was then taken to a hospital. On August 27, the district attorney&#x27;s office announced that charges would not be filed against Pippen.

<doc id="322454" wikidata="Q440210" url="?curid=322454" title="Horace Grant">
<text>Horace Junior Grant Sr. (born July 4, 1965) is an American former professional basketball player who is a special advisor for Michael Reinsdorf, the president and chief operating officer of the Chicago Bulls. He played college basketball at Clemson University before playing professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he became a four-time champion; winning three championships with the Chicago Bulls and one championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. Horace is the twin brother of former NBA player Harvey Grant. Horace made an NBA All-Star Game in 1994.

==Early life==
Grant was born on July 4, 1965, in Augusta, Georgia. He and his twin brother, Harvey, grew up in Hancock County, Georgia and attended school in Sparta, Georgia.

==College career==
Grant attended Clemson University, where he was a member of Pi Kappa Alpha. With the Clemson Tigers, he became the first player in ACC history to lead the league in scoring (21.0 average), rebounding (9.6) and field goal shooting (70.8 percent). In 1987, Grant helped lead Clemson to the NCAA Tournament and was named ACC Player of the Year, becoming the first Clemson player to receive that honor.

==Professional career==
===Chicago Bulls (1987–1994)===

Grant was drafted by the Chicago Bulls with the 10th overall pick of the 1987 NBA draft. The 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall power forward / center teamed with fellow draft-day acquisition Scottie Pippen to form the Bulls&#x27; forward tandem of the future, although he initially backed up incumbent Charles Oakley, one of the league&#x27;s premier rebounders and post defenders.

In 1988, Grant moved into the starting lineup when Oakley was traded to the New York Knicks for center Bill Cartwright. He immediately became the Bulls&#x27; main rebounder, and established himself as the Bulls&#x27; third scoring option after Michael Jordan and Pippen, forming one of the league&#x27;s best trios. Grant was noted for his defensive play; he was selected four times for the NBA All-Defensive Team. He helped Chicago win three consecutive NBA championships (1991, 1992, and 1993), securing the third with a last-second block on Kevin Johnson.

Grant, who was diagnosed with myopia and wore eyeglasses, began wearing goggles fitted with prescription lenses on the court starting with the 1990–91 season. The goggles soon became a trademark for Grant. Although he eventually received LASIK surgery to correct his sight, he continued to wear the goggles on the court after he had heard from parents that he had become an inspirational figure to children who wore eyeglasses.

After Jordan&#x27;s first retirement following the 1992–93 season, Grant became the number-two star behind Pippen, and helped the Bulls push the Knicks to seven games in the second-round playoff series before being eliminated. Grant played in the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, posting four points and eight rebounds in 17 minutes. During the 1993–94 season he recorded career-best averages in scoring (15.1), rebounding (11.0), and assists (3.4).

===Orlando Magic (1994–1999)===
Grant left the Bulls as a free agent and joined the Orlando Magic, led by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Penny Hardaway. On May 5, 1995, Grant made the final basket in Boston Garden history in Orlando&#x27;s series-clinching victory over the Boston Celtics. Grant helped the Magic reach the 1995 NBA Finals, where they were swept in four games by the Houston Rockets. Grant spent the next several seasons with the Magic.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1999–2000)===
Grant was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics along with 2000 and 2001 second round picks for Dale Ellis, Don MacLean, Billy Owens, and rookie Corey Maggette just before start of the 1999–2000 season.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2000–2001)===
After one year with the Sonics, Grant was involved in a three-way trade in which Glen Rice of the Los Angeles Lakers was sent to New York, Patrick Ewing of the Knicks was sent to Seattle, and Grant to the defending champion Lakers, reuniting him with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and former Bulls coach Phil Jackson. He helped them win another championship in the 2000–01 season.

===Return to Orlando (2001–2002)===
In the offseason, Grant decided to leave Los Angeles and sign back with the Orlando Magic. The Los Angeles Lakers would go on to win the 2002 NBA championship without Grant. Grant was ultimately cut by the Magic in December 2002 after then-coach Doc Rivers said Grant had tried to undermine the coach and was a &quot;cancer&quot; on the team.

===Return to Los Angeles (2003–2004)===

Grant chose to retire after getting cut by the Magic. However, he decided to return for another run with the Lakers for the 2003–04 season as a backup to Karl Malone. He then retired permanently following the Lakers&#x27; loss to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals.

==Post-retirement==
In 2009 Grant was appointed NBA Goodwill Ambassador.

In 2016, he became Special Advisor for Michael Reinsdorf, the president and chief operating officer of the Chicago Bulls.

==Personal life==
Grant&#x27;s identical twin brother, Harvey Grant, played 11 NBA seasons for the Washington Bullets/Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers, and Philadelphia 76ers.

Grant was best friends with former teammate Scottie Pippen for many years when they were both on the Bulls. He said they grew apart when he left Chicago for Orlando, but that they are still friends and keep in touch.

When asked why he wore his signature goggles, Grant said he originally wore them because he was legally blind, but even after receiving Lasik surgery, he continued wearing his goggles without the prescription in order to remain a positive influence so kids who needed glasses would think it&#x27;s cool. 

Three of Grant&#x27;s nephews are also basketball players. Jerai Grant played college basketball for Clemson University and currently plays overseas; Jerian Grant played for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish men&#x27;s basketball team, he plays in Panathinaikos and was selected as the EuroCup Basketball MVP of the 2022-23 EuroCup Basketball; and Jerami Grant played for the Syracuse University Orange men&#x27;s basketball team and currently plays for the Portland Trail Blazers.

Horace has three sons (Deon, Horace Jr., and Elijah) and five daughters (Coriel, Gianna, Maia, Naomi, and Eva).
