<doc id="308199" wikidata="Q354389" url="?curid=308199" title="Raymond III, Count of Tripoli">
<text>Raymond III (1140 – September/October 1187) was count of Tripoli from 1152 to 1187. He was a minor when Nizari Assassins murdered his father, Count Raymond II of Tripoli. His cousin, King Baldwin III of Jerusalem, who was staying in Tripoli, made Raymond&#x27;s mother, Hodierna of Jerusalem, regent. Raymond spent the following years at the royal court in Jerusalem. He reached the age of majority in 1155, after which he participated in a series of military campaigns against Nur ad-Din, the Zengid ruler of Damascus. In 1161 he hired pirates to pillage the Byzantine coastline and islands to take vengeance on Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos, who had refused to marry his sister Melisende. He was captured in the Battle of Harim by Nur ad-Din&#x27;s troops on 10 August 1164, and imprisoned in Aleppo for almost ten years. During his captivity, his cousin King Amalric of Jerusalem administered the county of Tripoli on his behalf.

Raymond was released for a large ransom which he had to borrow from the Knights Hospitaller. He married Eschiva of Bures, making him prince of Galilee and one of the wealthiest noblemen in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Amalric died in 1174, leaving a minor son, Baldwin IV, as his successor. As the child-king&#x27;s closest male relative, Raymond was elected bailiff (or regent). Raymond remained neutral during the conflicts between Nur ad-Din&#x27;s successors and his former commander, Saladin, which facilitated the unification of Egypt and a significant part of Syria under Saladin. When Baldwin reached the age of majority in 1176, Raymond&#x27;s regency ended and he returned to Tripoli. Baldwin was ailing, and Raymond and Bohemond III of Antioch sought to diminish the influence of his mother, Agnes of Courtenay, and her brother, Joscelin III of Edessa, over the government. Before Easter 1180, they marched to Jerusalem, but their arrival had the opposite effect: Baldwin promptly arranged for his sister and heir Sibylla to be married to Guy of Lusignan, a supporter of the Courtenays, and Raymond had to leave the kingdom. In the following years, relations between Baldwin IV and Guy became tense, and the dying king disinherited his sister in favour of her son Baldwin V. On his deathbed In 1185, the king made Raymond bailiff for Baldwin V. Raymond&#x27;s authority would be limited, because Joscelin III of Edessa was made the child&#x27;s guardian, and all royal fortresses were placed into the custody of the military orders.

Baldwin V died suddenly in the summer of 1186, and Raymond convoked the barons of the realm to an assembly to Nablus. In his absence, Sibylla&#x27;s supporters took possession of Jerusalem. Raymond tried to persuade Sybilla&#x27;s half-sister, Isabella, and Isabella&#x27;s husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, to claim the throne, but Humphrey swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raymond refused to do homage to them and made an alliance with Saladin, allowing Saladin to cross Galilee during his campaigns against Jerusalem and to place a garrison in Galilee&#x27;s capital Tiberias. In the summer of 1187, Saladin decided to launch a full-scale invasion against the crusaders, and only then was Raymond reconciled with Guy. Raymond commanded the vanguard of the crusaders&#x27; army in the Battle of Hattin, which ended with their catastrophic defeat. He was one of the few crusader commanders who were not killed or captured. He fled to Tyre and then to Tripoli, where he died (probably of pleurisy) after bequeathing Tripoli to his godson, Raymond of Antioch. The late 12th-century historian William of Tyre held Raymond III in high regard, and contemporaneous Muslim historians also praised his intelligence. After the Battle of Hattin, Western historians tended to blame him for the crusaders&#x27; catastrophic defeat. In modern historiography, scholarly opinions are divided, with some historians accepting William of Tyre&#x27;s assessment, and others emphasizing Raymond&#x27;s selfishness and failures.

==Early life==

Born in 1140, Raymond was the only son of Raymond II of Tripoli () and Hodierna of Jerusalem. The Tripolitan dynasty originated in the County of Toulouse in southern France, but by the middle of the links between their Occitanian homeland and their county in the Levant had weakened. Raymond was still a child when he first witnessed a letter of grant of his father in 1151. The letter was also signed by his mother, an influential and active &quot;political agent&quot; of her age (as the historian Kevin J. Lewis characterises her), similar to her sisters, Queen Melisende of Jerusalem () and Dowager Princess Alice of Antioch. Her husband&#x27;s jealousy gave rise to scandalous matrimonial strife during the early 1150s. Although Queen Melisende came to Tripoli to mediate a reconciliation, Hodierna decided to leave for Jerusalem. Shortly after their departure, a band of Nizari Assassins murdered Raymond II at Tripoli&#x27;s southern gate. Melisende&#x27;s son Baldwin III of Jerusalem (), who was staying in Tripoli, recalled the widowed Hodierna to the town.

==Count==

===Minority===

Baldwin held an assembly after Raymond II&#x27;s burial at which the nobles of the County of Tripoli paid homage to Hodierna and her two minor children, Raymond and Melisende. Raymond II had decreed that &quot;the master of the county and the count&#x27;s son&quot;—an otherwise poorly documented official—was to administer Tripoli if an underage count succeeded to the throne. When appointing Hodierna to the regency for her son, Baldwin ignored the late count&#x27;s instructions. The teenage Raymond spent several years at the royal court in Jerusalem. The first extant document that he witnessed in Jerusalem was issued on 23 September 1152 or 1153. Lewis proposes that Baldwin III probably supervised Raymond&#x27;s knightly education.

===First years of majority===
Raymond reached the age of majority in 1155. In his first extant charter, issued on 11 June 1157, he confirmed his father&#x27;s diploma about the grant of Tortosa (now Tartus in Syria) to the Knights Templar. Nur ad-Din, the Zengid ruler of Aleppo and Damascus (), ambushed Baldwin III at Jacob&#x27;s Fort on the Jordan River eight days later. After Nur ad-Din laid siege to Baniyas, Baldwin III sent envoys to Tripoli and Antioch to seek assistance from Raymond and Raynald of Châtillon (). They hurried to Chastel Neuf (at present-day Margaliot in Israel) to join the decimated royal army. After their arrival, Nur ad-Din withdrew his troops without resistance.

An earthquake destroyed Tripoli, Arqa and Krak des Chevaliers in August 1157. Taking advantage of the arrival of Thierry, Count of Flanders () at the head of a sizeable army in October, Baldwin III, Raynald of Châtillon and Raymond decided to launch a joint campaign against the Muslim towns of North Syria which had been ruined by the catastrophe. The crusaders first attacked Chastel Rouge near the border of the County of Tripoli, but they could not force the defenders to surrender. They could not seize Shaizar, either; Thierry of Flanders and Raynald of Châtillon claimed the town even before it was occupied, and they could not reach a compromise. The siege of Harenc (now Harem in Syria) was a success, but the crusading leaders finished the campaign after they captured it in January 1158.

Seeking a wife from the crusader states, the widowed Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos () sent envoys to Baldwin III in 1160. Manuel said that he was willing to marry Maria of Antioch or Raymond&#x27;s sister, Melisende, who were both closely related to the King. Baldwin proposed Melisende, and the emperor acknowledged his choice. Twelve galleys were built at Raymond&#x27;s order, because he wanted to have a magnificent retinue for his sister during her voyage to Constantinople. The emperor then changed his mind and began negotiations about his marriage to Maria with her mother, Constance of Antioch (). Feeling slighted for himself and his sister, Raymond crewed his newly built fleet with criminals and sent them to raid the Byzantine coasts and islands in August 1161. The pirates captured and plundered sacred places, and attacked pilgrims.

Nur ad-Din raided Krak des Chevaliers and laid siege to Harenc in the summer of 1164. Raymond marched out to join the crusaders (who were assembling to relieve the fortress), but they were defeated in the Battle of Harim on 10 August. Thousands of crusaders fell during the battle and Raymond, Bohemond III of Antioch (), Joscelin III of Edessa, Hugh VIII of Lusignan and other commanders were captured.

===Captivity===

The crusader leaders captured at Harim were taken to Aleppo, where they were imprisoned. The chronicler William of Tyre&#x27;s contemporaneous report about Raymond&#x27;s captivity is contradictory. He claimed that Raymond had spent his imprisonment &quot;in beggary and iron&quot;, but he also emphasized that Raymond had learnt to read and acquired a high level of education in the prison. Modern historians assume, without positive evidence, that Raymond learnt Arabic during his captivity. Raymond, as William of Tyre continues, instructed his &quot;loyal vassals&quot; to acknowledge King Amalric of Jerusalem (), who had succeeded Baldwin III, as the lawful ruler of Tripoli for the duration of his captivity. Amalric hurried to Tripoli and took full responsibility for its government, assuming the title of &quot;administrator of the county of Tripoli&quot;. He was able to persuade Nur ad-Din to release Bohemond III and Thoros II, Prince of Armenia (), because they were the Byzantine emperor&#x27;s vassals; Raymond remained imprisoned.

Amalric was the crusader states&#x27; supreme ruler but his position was fragile. Bertrand de Blanchefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, reminded Louis VII of France () in November 1164 that Amalric would be unable to defend the Frankish East alone. Nur ad-Din captured the fortress at al-Munaytira in 1165 (or 1166), and destroyed the Templars&#x27; castles at Halba, Araima and Safita in the summer of 1167. Lewis argues that Nur ad-Din captured Gibelacar during the latter campaign; the fortress was recaptured in late 1169 or early 1170.

The date and the circumstances of Raymond&#x27;s release are uncertain. According to William of Tyre, Raymond was set free after spending eight solar years in captivity; the contemporaneous Muslim geographer Ibn Jubayr said that Raymond had been imprisoned for twelve lunar years. Another contemporaneous Muslim scholar, Ali ibn al-Athir, incorrectly recorded that Raymond was released after Nur ad-Din died on 15 May 1174, but Raymond had witnessed a royal charter in Jerusalem on 18 April of that year. The historian Marshall Baldwin proposes that Raymond was set free in the fall of 1173 or early in 1174. Lewis writes that Raymond was released because of developing conflict between Nur ad-Din and his ambitious commander, Saladin who had taken over rule of Egypt. The ailing Nur ad-Din (or his advisers) most probably regarded the crusader states as a buffer between his Syrian realm and Saladin&#x27;s Egypt.

William of Tyre reported that Raymond had to pay 80,000 pieces of gold as ransom, but could only pay 20,000. To guarantee payment of the arrears, Raymond surrendered hostages. Muslim authors wrote that Raymond&#x27;s ransom amounted to 150,000 Syrian dinars. Raymond borrowed money from the Knights Hospitaller to pay at least part of his ransom.

==Count and regent==

===First regency===

Walter of Saint Omer, Prince of Galilee, died in early 1174. King Amalric gave Walter&#x27;s widow, Eschiva of Bures, in marriage to Raymond, enabling him to seize the large fief of Galilee in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Their marriage was childless, but Raymond loved his wife and brought up her children by her first husband as if they were his own. King Amalric died on 11 July 1174. His only son, Baldwin IV, was crowned king four days later, although he was a minor and had lepromatous leprosy. The Jerusalemite seneschal Miles of Plancy took charge of the government, but was unable to persuade the commanders of the army to cooperate with him.

Taking advantage of the seneschal&#x27;s unpopularity, Raymond came to Jerusalem in August and laid claim to the regency on the grounds that he was the closest male relative and the most powerful vassal of the child king. Raymond also emphasized that since he had appointed the King&#x27;s father to administer Tripoli during his captivity, he was entitled to claim the same treatment. Miles of Plancy postponed the decision about Raymond&#x27;s claim, saying that only the plenary session of the High Court of Jerusalem could hear it.

Raymond returned to Tripoli, and Miles of Plancy was murdered in Acre in October 1174. The most powerful noblemen and clergymen assembled in Jerusalem to decide on the administration of the kingdom, and the bishops unanimously supported Raymond&#x27;s claim to regency. The constable Humphrey II of Toron, Reginald of Sidon, and the Ibelin brothers Baldwin and Balian also stood by him, but Raymond was elected bailiff (or regent) only after a two-day debate, most probably because other aristocrats distrusted him. Raymond was installed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional venue for royal coronations, in an extravagant ceremony. The King&#x27;s mother Agnes of Courtenay had been Amalric&#x27;s first wife but their marriage was annulled for consanguinity. Now Agnes was married to Reginald of Sidon, and Raymond allowed her to return to the royal court. He made the erudite William of Tyre chancellor, but left the office of seneschal vacant.

Saladin had expanded his rule to Damascus, Baalbek, Shaizar and Hama, taking advantage of the minority of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s son as-Salih Ismail al-Malik. Saladin occupied Homs in early December 1174, but the garrison at the citadel resisted. Without forcing the garrison to surrender, Saladin left Homs for Aleppo (the seat of the Zengids in Syria) and left a small army in Homs&#x27; lower town.

Saladin&#x27;s fierce determination to unite Egypt and Syria threatened the crusader states. Raymond mustered the troops of Jerusalem and Tripoli at Arqa in early 1175, but did not intervene in the conflict between Saladin and the Zengids. The defenders of the Homs citadel offered to set their Christian prisoners free if Raymond provided military assistance for them; the prisoners included the hostages who were surety for the arrears of his ransom. Raymond was willing to assist the defenders of Homs only if they immediately released their prisoners, but they refused his demand. William of Tyre later emphasized that the commanders of the crusader army doubted if the defenders of the Homs citadel actually wanted to release their prisoners. Saladin returned to Homs soon after he was informed about the negotiations between the crusaders and the garrison. Instead of attacking him, the crusader army retreated to Krak des Chevaliers; this enabled Saladin to capture the citadel on 17 March 1175. He sent envoys to the crusaders&#x27; camp to secure their neutrality in his conflict with the Zengids. After Saladin agreed to release the hostages, the crusader army withdrew to Tripoli. William of Tyre blamed Humphrey II of Toron for the crusaders&#x27; inactivity during the siege of Homs.

Saladin defeated the united Zengid armies of Aleppo and Mosul in the Battle of the Horns of Hama on 13 April, and concluded a peace treaty with Aleppo which consolidated his rule in South Syria. After he allowed his Egyptian troops to return home, the crusader army was disbanded in early May. Raymond proposed a truce to Saladin, which was signed on 22 July. The truce enabled Saladin to march through Oultrejordainthe easternmost territory of the Kingdom of Jerusalemduring his new campaign against Ghazi II Saif ud-Din of Mosul () in the summer of 1176.

===Campaigns===
Baldwin IV came of age at his fifteenth birthday on 15 July 1176. With the end of his regency, Raymond returned to Tripoli. Count Philip I of Flanders () landed at Acre at the head of a large army of crusaders from Europe on 1 August 1177. The young king and his advisers made several efforts to persuade him to join a military campaign against Egypt, Saladin&#x27;s principal power base, but Philip kept making excuses. According to rumours spreading among the crusaders, Raymond and Bohemond III convinced the count to resist because, as William of Tyre recorded it, they wanted to &quot;entice him to their own lands, hoping with his help to undertake something which would benefit their states&quot;.

Philip came to Tripoli in late October. Roger de Moulins, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, and more than 100 knights and 2,000 foot soldiers from the Kingdom of Jerusalem joined him in November. They attacked Hama, taking advantage of its governor&#x27;s illness. The siege lasted only four days, because Bohemond persuaded them to join him in attacking Harenc. They laid siege to the fortress in early December, but could not capture it. Bohemond made peace with the Zengid ruler of Aleppo, as-Salih Ismail al-Malik () in early 1177.

Raymond attacked a group of Turkmen and seized considerable booty from them in 1178 or 1179, but Saladin strengthened his border defence to prevent further raids. Saladin dispatched a group of horsemen to raid the Sidon region in early June 1179, and Baldwin mustered his troops to prevent their retreat. Raymond, who was staying at Tiberias, the capital of his Galilean principality, joined the royal army. They routed the raiders at a ford on the Litani River, but Saladin suddenly marched into Galilee and defeated the crusaders in the Battle of Marj Ayyun on 10 June. Although Raymond (who watched the battle from a hill) escaped to Tyre, his stepson Hugh of Saint Omer was captured.

According to the chronicle &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; (which contains many folkloristic elements), when the Flemish knight Gerard of Ridefort came to Tripoli, Raymond pledged the first wealthy heiress in his county in marriage to him. When William Dorel, Lord of Botrun (now Batroun in Lebanon) died—leaving a daughter as his heir—Raymond instead gave her to Plivain, a wealthy merchant from Pisa who had promised her weight in gold to him. Raymond&#x27;s perfidy outraged Ridefort, who left Tripoli and settled in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1179.

===Dynastic factions===

Raymond and Bohemond III mustered their troops and marched to Jerusalem in April 1180. Although they ostensibly came to celebrate Easter in the Holy City, the ailing Baldwin IV feared that they wanted to depose him. He hastily married his sister and heir presumptive, Sibylla, to Guy of Lusignan (a knight who had recently arrived from Poitou), although she had been promised to Duke Hugh III of Burgundy (). After studying the controversial reports of the events, the historian Bernard Hamilton concludes that Raymond and Bohemond staged a coup as they were concerned about the growing influence of the King&#x27;s mother and her brother, Joscelin III of Edessa. According to Hamilton, Raymond and Bohemond wanted to forcibly persuade the King to marry Sibylla to Baldwin of Ibelin (a local candidate of their choosing) instead of Hugh, who was related to the Courtenays, and Sibylla&#x27;s marriage to Guy destroyed their plan. Alternatively, the historians Steven Runciman and Baldwin write that Sybilla fell in love with Baldwin of Ibelin, but her mother, who disliked the Ibelins, decided to prevent the marriage. She sought the assistance of the seneschal Aimery of Lusignan, who introduced his brother Guy to Sybilla. She soon fell in love with the extraordinarily handsome youth, and convinced her brother to sanction their marriage. Baldwin adds that Raymond and Bohemond came to Jerusalem &quot;presumably on hearing of the projected match&quot; in an attempt to prevent it.

Since Raymond and Bohemond lost the King&#x27;s favour, they left Jerusalem shortly after Easter. They were crossing Galilee when Saladin invaded the region, and their arrival forced him to retreat. Saladin and Baldwin signed a two-year truce. The truce did not cover Tripoli, enabling Saladin to launch a sudden raid on the county. Since the surprise attack prevented Raymond from mustering his troops, he fled to the fortress of Arqa. Saladin&#x27;s army pillaged the northern plains of the county, and his fleet captured the island of Ruad at Tortosa (now Arwad in Lebanon). He withdrew his troops only after Raymond signed a truce. Over the following years, Raymond strengthened the county&#x27;s defence by granting new territories to the Knights Hospitaller or confirming his vassals&#x27; grants to them.

After a two-year absence, Raymond decided to again visit Galilee in April 1182 but Agnes of Courtenay and Joscelin III persuaded Baldwin IV to forbid his entrance to the Jerusalemite kingdom. Before long, certain &quot;princes and greater men of the realm&quot; (whom William of Tyre failed to identify) convinced the King to allow Raymond to come to Jerusalem. At the following general assembly, Raynald of Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain, proposed a military expedition across the Jordan River to prevent Saladin&#x27;s march from Egypt to Syria in May 1182. Raymond opposed Châtillon&#x27;s plan because it would have left the western lands of the kingdom undefended during the campaign, but Châtillon convinced most of the realm&#x27;s barons to accept his proposal.

===New conflicts===

Raymond accompanied the royal army to Oultrejordain. During his absence, troops from the nearby Muslim towns invaded Galilee and captured 500 women. The invaders seized a fortified cave near Tiberias, with the assistance of the native Christian garrison. The royal army returned to the kingdom&#x27;s central territories, because Baldwin suspected that Saladin was planning further raids. Raymond went to Tiberias, where he fell seriously ill. When Saladin besieged the castle of Bethsain (now Beit She&#x27;an in Israel) on 13 July, Raymond dispatched his stepson Hugh to command the troops of Galilee and join the royal army assembling near Saffuriya. The royal army forced Saladin to withdraw his troops from the principality. Raymond made a plundering raid on the region of Bosra in late 1182. According to Hamilton, it was &quot;a reconnaissance expedition&quot; because Bosra was an excellent location to study the southward movements of the Damascus army.

Saladin seized Aleppo, the Zengids&#x27; last important stronghold in Syria, on 12 June 1183; he soon decided to invade the Kingdom of Jerusalem and bring the crusaders to a pitched battle. At Baldwin&#x27;s order, more than 1,000 knights and about 15,000 foot soldiers gathered at Saffuriya. Raymond hurried to the mustering point. Baldwin developed a fever, which forced him to appoint Guy of Lusignan bailiff. Saladin crossed the Jordan and pillaged Bethsan on 29 September. Although he continued his campaign for nine days, the crusaders refrained from attacking his troops. William of Tyre reported that most common soldiers accused Guy&#x27;s opponents of refusing to attack the invaders because they feared that a victory would strengthen Guy&#x27;s position.

Relations between Guy and the King became tense during the following months. Baldwin summoned the realm&#x27;s barons to an assembly to discuss the future of the kingdom&#x27;s administration. Although the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem Heraclius, and the grand masters of the Templars and Hospitallers tried to intervene on Guy&#x27;s behalf, Raymond, Bohemond, Reginald of Sidon and the Ibelin brothers easily persuaded him to dismiss his brother-in-law. They also convinced the King to make Guy&#x27;s infant stepson, Baldwin of Montferrat, his heir, and the child was crowned on 20 November 1183. William of Tyre reported that it was &quot;the general wish&quot; that the King should appoint a regent, and most of the barons said that only Raymond &quot;was suited to hold this office&quot;. The assembly was soon dissolved, because news about Saladin&#x27;s sudden attack against Châtillon&#x27;s Kerak Castle reached Jerusalem. The King mustered an army, but could not personally participate in the campaign for long and appointed Raymond to command the army before it crossed the Jordan. Learning about the arrival of the relief army, Saladin lifted the siege on 3 or 4 December.

===Second regency===

In October 1184, Guy of Lusignan raided the Bedouin tribes who grazed their herds in the royal domain of Deir al-Balah. This action enraged the King, who (according to William of Tyre) soon assembled the realm&#x27;s barons and handed over &quot;the government of the kingdom and its general administration&quot; to Raymond. In contrast, Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle and the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; state that Baldwin IV decided to appoint a regent only after the members of the High Court had warned him that Guy (who was the stepfather of Baldwin&#x27;s minor heir) was still entitled to govern the kingdom after his death. The dying king asked them to name their candidate, and they unanimously nominated Raymond. According to Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, Baldwin IV accepted their choice and asked Raymond &quot;to act as regent of the kingdom and of the child for ten years until the child came of age&quot;. Although most sources failed to mention the date of these events, one version of the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; states that Raymond was made regent in 1185.

Ernoul and the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; recorded that the High Court passed specific rules about the regency before Raymond was installed: the barons chose Joscelin III as the child king&#x27;s guardian, also stipulating that the military orders would hold all royal fortresses during the King&#x27;s minority, but Beirut was granted to Raymond to compensate him for the expenses of state administration. The High Court also ruled that if the child king died before reaching the age of majority, the pope, the Holy Roman emperor and the kings of France and England would be approached to decide whether his mother Sybilla or her half-sister, Isabella, had the stronger claim to succeed him. Although some versions of the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; hint that Raymond persuaded the High Court to pass these rules, most of them were clearly adopted to limit the regent&#x27;s authority.

The date of Baldwin IV&#x27;s death is unknown, but it is certain that he died before 16 May 1185. The King was still alive when Raymond sent envoys to Saladin to begin negotiating an armistice. Saladin granted a four-year truce, and a continuator of William of Tyre&#x27;s chronicle wrote that &quot;the land was free from external battles&quot; during Raymond&#x27;s second regency. Saladin agreed to make peace with the crusaders because Izz ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud, the Zengid ruler of Mosul (), had formed a coalition against him. Saladin made a series of attacks against Mosul, forcing Izz ad-Din to accept his suzerainty in March 1186. Raymond could not strengthen his authority during his regency; Joscelin III of Edessa, Patriarch Heraclius, and Peter, Archdeacon of Lydda (who had succeeded William of Tyre as chancellor) were Guy of Lusignan&#x27;s supporters, and the Knights Templar elected his enemy Gerard of Ridefort as their grand master.

==Last years==

===Sibylla and Guy&#x27;s accession===

Baldwin V died unexpectedly in Acre during the summer of 1186. The cause of the child king&#x27;s death is unknown. Joscelin III convinced Raymond to go to Tiberias to make preparations for a general assembly and let the Templars deliver the young king&#x27;s body to Jerusalem. Taking advantage of Raymond&#x27;s absence, Joscelin took control of Acre and Beirut. Raymond summoned the barons to Nablus, the fief of Balian of Ibelin (one of his main supporters). According to the contemporaneous German chronicler Arnold of Lübeck and Ibn al-Athir, Raymond tried to seize the throne at the assembly. The reports are clear evidence of a widespread belief in Raymond&#x27;s ambitions to seize the crown, but their reliability is questionable according to Hamilton.

While most of the barons were assembling at Nablus, Sibylla and Guy of Lusignan attended the King&#x27;s funeral in Jerusalem. The patriarch of Jerusalem, the grand masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, and Raynald of Châtillon were also present. Staunch supporters of Sybilla, they decided to offer her the crown without waiting for the decision of the four Western monarchs (as the High Court had stipulated in early 1185). Although she invited the barons at Nablus to attend her coronation, they did not acknowledge her right to rule, forbade the ceremony, and sent two Cistercian abbots to Jerusalem to inform her of their veto. Raymond dispatched one of his retainers to accompany the abbots in disguise and to spy in the capital.

Sibylla&#x27;s supporters ignored the barons&#x27; opposition, and Patriarch Heraclius crowned her before the end of September. She then put the crown on Guy&#x27;s head, and the patriarch anointed him. According to the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot;, Ridefort proudly declared &quot;this crown well worth the marriage of Botrun&quot; in reference to Raymond&#x27;s betrayal. Raymond and his supporters decided to elect Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister Isabella and her husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, queen and king, but Humphreywho was Châtillon&#x27;s stepsonsecretly left Nablus for Jerusalem and paid homage to Guy. Most barons followed Humphrey&#x27;s example, swearing fealty to the royal couple before the end of October. After his former partisans abandoned him, Raymond returned to Tiberias without paying homage to Sibylla and Guy.
===Towards Hattin===

Guy accused Raymond of betrayal and invaded Galilee in October. The King demanded an accounting of Raymond&#x27;s regency, but Raymond answered that he had spent all royal income on state administration. Raymond decided to resist and sought assistance from Saladin. The sultan sent troops to Tiberias, forcing Guy to withdraw. According to Ibn al-Athir, Saladin offered to make Raymond &quot;an independent king for the Franks one and all&quot;. Arnold of Lübeck wrote that Raymond pledged to allow Saladin&#x27;s army to invade the kingdom across Galilee in exchange for the sultan&#x27;s assistance in seizing the throne.

Lewis suggests that the Occitanian troubadour Peire Vidal visited Raymond&#x27;s court in Tiberias around the time of the conflict between Raymond and the royal couple. Raymond provided patronage to Vidal, who dedicated a eulogy to him in one of his poems. Lewis notes that it was around that time that Raymond offered to appoint a member of the House of Toulouse his heir if he was willing to settle in the County of Tripoli. Since Raymond&#x27;s offer is only recorded in a version of a late source, the &quot;Lignages d&#x27;Outremer&quot;, it may have been invented by its author.

Saladin decided to launch a full-scale invasion against the kingdom, and began mustering forces from his whole empire in early 1187. The barons convinced Guy to seek reconciliation with Raymond. The masters of the two military orders, Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre, Raynald of Sidon and Balian of Ibelin, were appointed to begin negotiations with Raymond in Tiberias. Saladin&#x27;s son, al-Afdal, sent Muzaffar al-Din, lord of Harenc and Edessa, to raid the kingdom. In accordance with his treaty with Saladin, Raymond allowed the Syrian troops free entry into Galilee. After al-Afdal began raiding the Nazareth region, the masters of the military orders (Gerard of Ridefort and Roger des Moulins) attacked the invaders, although the enemy forces seriously outnumbered their retinue. The raiders almost annihilated the crusaders at the springs of Cresson on 1 May; only Ridefort and three knights escaped the battlefield. The &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; blamed Ridefort for the catastrophe, emphasizing that Raymond&#x27;s envoys had warned him not to attack the large Syrian army. The invaders rode back to Syria across Galilee, displaying the severed heads of crusaders killed in battle on the points of their lances.

Balian of Ibelin and the archbishops of Tyre and Nazareth arrived at Tiberias the following day. Ernoulwho was present, as Ibelin&#x27;s squirewrote that the news of the crusaders&#x27; catastrophe came as a shock to Raymond, and he soon agreed to pay homage to Guy. He expelled the Muslim garrison which had been stationed in Tiberias since his alliance with Saladin. According to Ibn al-Athir, Raymond agreed to come to terms with the King only after his vassals threatened him with disobedience, and the prelates announced that they were ready to excommunicate him and annul his marriage. Raymond and the king met near Jerusalem, at Fort St Job, which was held by the Hospitallers. After they dismounted, Raymond knelt to the King in homage. According to Ernoul, Guy soon lifted him up and expressed regret for his irregular coronation.

===Hattin and its consequences===

The King ordered the assembly of the kingdom&#x27;s troops at Saffuriya. Raymond joined the royal army with all the knights from Galilee, leaving his wife in Tiberias at the head of a small garrison. Knights from the County of Tripoli also came to Saffuriya. On 2 July 1187, Saladin invaded Galilee and besieged Tiberias. The news about the siege of Tiberias aroused fresh conflict among the crusaders, because Raymond and Ridefort proposed opposite strategies. Emphasizing that the town could resist even a prolonged siege, Raymond wanted to avoid a pitched battle and proposed that Guy send envoys to Antioch asking Bohemond III for reinforcements. Ridefort and Châtillon accused him of cowardice, adding that passivity would cost the King his kingdom. Since the King was obviously willing to accept Raymond&#x27;s proposal, Ridefort reminded him of Raymond&#x27;s previous alliance with Saladin. The King finally decided to attack, and ordered his army to march towards Tiberias.

As lord of the region, Raymond was appointed to guide the army across Galilee. After Saladin&#x27;s troops began attacking the rear held by the Templars, the crusaders halted at Maskana although the local well could not provide enough water for a large army. Ernoul blamed Raymond for this decision, but the anonymous author of the chronicle known as the &quot;Libellus de expugnatione Terrae Sanctae per Saladinum&quot;—who also participated in the campaign—wrote that the King decided to stop against Raymond&#x27;s advice. Saladin&#x27;s troops encircled the crusaders&#x27; camp and killed all crusaders who left it in search of water. The army continued marching towards Tiberias the following day, with Raymond commanding the vanguard and Saladin&#x27;s troops attacking them. A group of thirsty foot soldiers which tried to break through enemy lines towards the distant Sea of Galilee was massacred, and five of Raymond&#x27;s knights defected to Saladin&#x27;s side. Raymond led a cavalry charge against the right wing of Saladin&#x27;s army in an attempt to reach the springs near Hattin, forcing the Muslim troops to open a pass without resistance. Instead of turning back, Raymond and the crusaders who had accompanied him (including Reynald of Sidon, Balian of Ibelin and Joscelin III of Edessa) hurried to Safed and then to Tyre.

The rest of the crusader army was annihilated; Raymond&#x27;s many Tripolitan vassalsPlivain of Botrun, Hugh II Embriaco and Melioret of Maraqiyyawere captured. The towns of the kingdom, left nearly defenseless, could not resist, and Saladin captured almost all of them over the following month. Eschiva of Bures surrendered Tiberias to Saladin and joined Raymond in Tyre. After Saladin occupied Beirut on 6 August, Raymond fled to Tripoli because he thought that Saladin could easily capture Tyre. His old allies, Balian of Ibelin and Raynald of Sidon, soon joined him.

Raymond fell seriously ill in Tripoli. The contemporaneous chronicler Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad recorded that he had pleurisy. Other sourcesErnoul, the &quot;Estoire de Eracles&quot; and Abu&#x27;l-Fidaemphasized that Raymond&#x27;s sorrow for the crusaders&#x27; catastrophic defeat at Hattin caused his illness. The childless Raymond willed the County of Tripoli to the eldest son of Bohemond III of Antioch, Raymond, who was his godson. Although the contemporaneous Ralph of Diceto recorded that Raymond died fifteen days after the fall of Jerusalem, on 17 October 1187, Lewis proposes that Raymond probably died in September.

==Legacy==

William of Tyre, who held Raymond in high regard, described him as a man with &quot;much foresight&quot; in politics and warfare. His praise was tempered with criticism, and he called Raymond&#x27;s 1179 escape from the battlefield at Marj Ayyun &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Although William (who was made chancellor and archbishop during Raymond&#x27;s first regency) cannot be regarded as a neutral observer, his chronicle strongly influenced the works of Runciman, Baldwin and other 20th-century historians. According to Baldwin, William&#x27;s account of Raymond&#x27;s political and military talents should be regarded &quot;more a statement of fact than an expression of opinion&quot;. Lewis refutes Raymond&#x27;s positive assessment, saying that his &quot;career reads as a veritable litany of inconsequential, misguided, or downright disastrous endeavours&quot;. Barber emphasizes that Raymond&#x27;s &quot;actions were usually driven by his own personal ambitions and needs&quot;.

Contemporary Muslim authors described Raymond as an intelligent, astute politician. Ibn al-Athir wrote that the crusaders &quot;had nobody more influential than him, none braver and none more excellent in counsel&quot;. Ibn al-Athir emphasized Raymond&#x27;s bad reputation among the Muslims, saying that Raymond was &quot;the devil among the Franks and the most unyieldingly hostile to the Muslims&quot;. The 13th-century Arab historian Abu Shama records that some Muslims also regarded Raymond as one of the principal enemies of the Muslim world, and urged Saladin to capture (and kill) him and Raynald of Châtillon.

Baldwin, Runciman and other historians, who based their works primarily on the chronicles of William of Tyre and Ernoul, regard Raymond as a leader of the &quot;pullani&quot; (natives) who wanted to keep peace with Saladin because they wanted to ensure the survival of the crusader states. These scholars see Raymond&#x27;s opponents as newcomers whose aggressive policy led to the fall of the kingdom. They accept the positive picture of Saladin in his official biographies, which describe him as a trustworthy man who never broke his word. Andrew Ehrenkreutz was the first historian to conclude that Saladin&#x27;s biographies should be treated critically, due to their similarity to hagiographies of canonized European monarchs. Accepting this critical approach, Hamilton doubts Saladin&#x27;s willingness to &quot;live at peace with his Christian neighbors&quot; and allow them to keep Jerusalem (one of Islam&#x27;s holiest cities).

The fall of Jerusalem and nearly the entire Holy Land after the Battle of Hattin was a terrible blow to the Christian world. Raymond&#x27;s alliance with Saladin and his escape from the battlefield aroused suspicion, and many Christian writers regarded him a traitor. About 60 years after the events, the chronicler Alberic of Trois-Fontaines said that Raymond and Saladin solidified their alliance by drinking each other&#x27;s blood. The Minstrel of Reims believed that Saladin reminded Raymond of his oath of alliance to persuade him to leave the battlefield at the Horns of Hattin. Robert of Auxerre, William of Nangis and other medieval European historians accused Raymond of apostasy, saying that he had been circumcised shortly before God killed him for his betrayal. Muslim historians also knew that the Christians thought that Raymond had converted (or, at least, wanted to convert) to Islam. The contemporaneous Muslim historian Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani wrote that Raymond did not convert only because he was afraid of his co-religionists. Modern historians agree that the stories of Raymond&#x27;s conversion were invented.

<text>Wardour Street () is a street in Soho, City of Westminster, London. It is a one-way street that runs north from Leicester Square, through Chinatown, across Shaftesbury Avenue to Oxford Street. Throughout the 20th century the West End street became a centre for the British film industry and the popular music scene.

==History==
There has been a thoroughfare on the site of Wardour Street on maps and plans since they were first printed, the earliest being Elizabethan. In 1585, to settle a legal dispute, a plan of what is now the West End was prepared. The dispute was about a field roughly where Broadwick Street is today. The plan was very accurate and clearly gives the name &quot;Colmanhedge Lane&quot; to this major route across the fields from what is described as &quot;The Waye from Vxbridge to London&quot; (Oxford Street) to what is now Cockspur Street. The old plan shows that this lane follows the modern road almost exactly, including bends at Brewer Street and Old Compton Street.

The road is also a major thoroughfare on Faithorne and Newcourt&#x27;s map surveyed between 1643 and 1647. Although they do not give it a name, it is shown to have about 24 houses, and additionally a large &quot;Gaming House&quot; roughly on the present-day northwest corner of Leicester Square. The map also shows a large windmill, about 50 yards to the west of what is now St Anne&#x27;s Church, roughly on the current alignment of Great Windmill Street.
The name &quot;Colmanhedge Lane&quot; did not last, and a 1682 map by Ogilby and Morgan shows the lane split into three parts. The northern part is shown as &quot;SO HO&quot;, the middle part &quot;Whitcomb Street&quot; and the remainder, from James Street south, is &quot;Hedge Lane&quot;. It is not clear from the map where the boundary between &quot;SO HO&quot; and &quot;Whitcombe Street&quot; is—probably somewhere between Compton Street and Gerrard Street. These three names are on the Morden and Lea map of 1682.

Wardour Street was renamed and building began in 1686, as shown by a plaque formerly on the house at the corner with Broadwick Street. Sir Edward Wardour owned land in the area, and &quot;Edward Street&quot; was what is now the stretch of Broadwick Street between Wardour Street and Berwick Street, as shown by Roque. Neither side of the street was fully built up by 1720. John Rocque shows both roads very clearly on his large-scale map of 1746. From Oxford Street south to Meard Street is now &quot;Wardour Street&quot;; then south to Compton Street is &quot;Old Soho&quot;; then down to Coventry Street is &quot;Princes Street&quot;. For the length of Leicester Square it is &quot;Whitcomb Street&quot; and finally &quot;Hedge Lane&quot;, which now starts at Panton Street rather than James Street. 

By the end of the 18th century, Horwood, on a large map of 1799, uses the same names but not &quot;Old Soho&quot; and &quot;Hedge Lane&quot;. This leaves just &quot;Wardour&quot;, &quot;Princes&quot; and &quot;Whitcomb&quot; streets. The houses have individual numbers by then, and are shown in detail on Horwood&#x27;s map.

The names are much the same on Greenwood&#x27;s map of 1827, although the area at the southern end had been redeveloped. The road now ends at Pall Mall East, and the boundary between &quot;Wardour&quot; and &quot;Princes&quot; streets may have moved north a little.

By 1846, Cruchley&#x27;s new plan of London shows change at the southern end. &quot;Wardour&quot;, &quot;Princes&quot; and &quot;Whitcomb&quot; streets stay the same; however, &quot;Whitcomb Street&quot; loses a few hundred yards at the southern end, and from James Street to Pall Mall is now &quot;Dorset Place&quot;.

In Victorian times, &quot;Princes Street&quot; is still shown on the 1871 Ordnance Survey map. Stanford&#x27;s Map of Central London 1897, at to a mile (1:10560), has just two names, &quot;Wardour Street&quot; from Oxford Street to Coventry Street, and &quot;Whitcomb Street&quot; south from there. It has remained like this since, though the numbering of premises was rationalised around 1896.

In the late 19th century, Wardour Street was known for (sometimes slightly shoddy) furniture stores, antique shops, and dealers in artists&#x27; supplies. A complicated succession of members of the Wright family were in business in a variety of art and furniture-related fields between 1827 and 1919 at numbers 22 (the first and last), and also 23, 26, 134 and 144, with at least two businesses run by cousins in the latter part of the century. Wright was used for picture frames by the new National Gallery from at least 1856, when they made the large new frame for the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; by Paolo Veronese that is still in place. The phrase &quot;Wardour Street English&quot; denotes the use of near-obsolete words purely for effect. An example is &quot;anent&quot;, a preposition, meaning &quot;concerning&quot;. This usage derives from the once great number of antique shops in the area. The Paris-born luthier Georges Chanot III had a shop and violin-making business at no. 157 for many years.

==20th century==

During this period, it became a centre of the British film industry, with the big production and distribution companies having their headquarters in the street. By the end of the century most of the big film companies had moved elsewhere, leaving some smaller independent production houses and post-production companies still based in the area.

From 1935, the Shim Sham Club, an unlicensed jazz club popular with black and gay audiences run by Ike Hatch, and its successor the Rainbow Roof, were at 37 Wardour Street. The Flamingo Club was situated at numbers 33–37 from 1957 until 1967. The Vortex Club at 203 Wardour Street is mentioned in a song by the Jam, &quot;A-Bomb in Wardour Street&quot;. Based in the discothèque Crackers, in 1977 the club hosted early concerts by punk bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Slits and Adam and the Ants. From 1964 to 1988, number 90 was the site of the Marquee Club, and since the late 1960s, number 159 has been the home of the St Moritz nightclub. The Eric Gilder School of Music was at 195 Wardour Street (its original building is now demolished).

==21st century==

The street is home to more than 30 restaurants and bars north of Shaftesbury Avenue. South of Shaftesbury Avenue there are many well-known Chinese restaurants including the large Wong Kei at 41–43. A London County Council blue plaque on Wong Kei&#x27;s commemorates costume designer and wigmaker Willy Clarkson whose business was based in the building.

The street crosses, or meets with, Lisle Street, Gerrard Street, Rupert Court, Dansey Place, Shaftesbury Avenue, Winette Street, Tisbury Court, Old Compton Street, Brewer Street, Bourchier Street, Peter Street, Tyler&#x27;s Court, Flaxman Court, Broadwick Street, St Anne&#x27;s Court, Sheraton Street, D&#x27;Arblay Street, Hollen Street, Noel Street and Oxford Street.

== Chinese Name ==
The street signs of Wardour Street appear in both English and Chinese, where the meaning of the Chinese name (街) is likely &quot;Chinese Metropolis Street&quot; given the vicinity of Chinatown.

<text>Tax reform is the process of changing the way taxes are collected or managed by the government and is usually undertaken to improve tax administration or to provide economic or social benefits. Tax reform can include reducing the level of taxation of all people by the government, making the tax system more progressive or less progressive, or simplifying the tax system and making the system more understandable or more accountable.

Numerous organizations have been set up to reform tax systems worldwide, often with the intent to reform income taxes or value added taxes into something considered more economically liberal. Other reforms propose tax systems that attempt to deal with externalities. Such reforms are sometimes proposed to be revenue-neutral, for example in revenue neutrality of the FairTax, meaning they ought not result in more tax or less being collected. Georgism claims that various forms of land tax can both deal with externalities and improve productivity.

==Australia==
Tax reform was an increasingly significant issue on the Australian political agenda. Combined annual deficits of the Commonwealth and State and territory governments will rise from 1.9% of gross domestic product in 2011–12 to 5.9% of GDP by 2049–50. Widespread, wholesale tax reform in Australia has not occurred since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2000. The Henry Tax Review identified 138 areas for significant reform to Australia&#x27;s tax system over the next 10 to 20 years.

In July 2013, PricewaterhouseCoopers proposed significant tax reform in the context of an ageing population and slowing of the Australian mining boom. PricewaterhouseCoopers proposed improving the efficiency of the Australian tax system through analysing the competitiveness of the levels of taxation, its effect on production and the importance of broad-based taxes to reduce economic distortion. For example, over 115 other taxes raise less revenue than one tax: the Goods and Services Tax. This report received widespread coverage in the Australian press.

== United States ==

There have been many movements in the United States to reform the collection and management of taxes.

During the late 19th century, American economist Henry George started a global movement for tax reform. The aim of the movement was the abolition of all forms of taxation other than the Single Tax on land value. The effects of the movement on taxation policy, although diminished, can be seen in many parts of the world including Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Efforts to promote this form of tax reform in the United States continue under the aegis of organizations such as &quot;The Henry George Foundation of America&quot;.

In 1986, landmark tax reform was passed in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In the 1990s, reform proposals arose over the double-taxation of corporate income, with a large report in 1992 by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

During the Bush administration, the President&#x27;s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform recommended the removal of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Several organizations are working for tax reform in the United States including Americans for Tax Reform, Americans For Fair Taxation and Americans Standing for the Simplification of the Estate Tax (ASSET). Various proposals have been put forth for tax simplification in the United States, including the FairTax and various flat tax plans and bipartisan tax reform proposals.

In 2010, Fareed Zakaria proposed what he described as a &quot;grand bargain&quot; with tax reform for economic adversaries Paul Krugman and Niall Ferguson; an attempt to bridge their political divide with the creation of a simple and indirect Federal Sales Tax. Representative Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania introduced a bill, H.R. 4646, called the &quot;Debt Free America Act&quot; that would introduce a 1% financial transaction tax and eliminate federal income tax. He has introduced bills calling for similar tax reform since 2004, but the bills have never made it out of committee.

President Obama&#x27;s tax reform proposals are highlighted in his administration&#x27;s 2013 United States federal budget proposal and in a framework for corporate and international tax reform presented by the administration. While some of these proposals have become irrelevant due to the “United States fiscal cliff” agreement at the end of calendar year 2012, these policies present a center-left approach to tax reform. In general, the proposals involve some marginal tax rate increases, some marginal tax rate decreases, and base broadening by closing, canceling, or limiting tax loopholes, deductions, credits, or other tax expenditures for top income earners and corporations.

In December 2017, the Senate passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 22, 2017 President Trump signed into law the tax reform bill passed by the House and Senate.

The business community avidly lobbied in support of the bill, which included corporate tax cuts among more comprehensive reform. The National Retail Federation was a leading voice in this effort, since previously, retailers paid one of the highest corporate tax rates.

== Tax choice ==

Tax choice is the theory that taxpayers should have more control with how their individual taxes are allocated. If taxpayers could choose which government organizations received their taxes, opportunity cost decisions would integrate their partial knowledge. For example, a taxpayer who allocated more of his taxes on public education would have less to allocate on public healthcare. Supporters argue that allowing taxpayers to demonstrate their preferences would help ensure that the government succeeds at efficiently producing the public goods that taxpayers truly value.

<doc id="308208" wikidata="Q467448" url="?curid=308208" title="Americans for Tax Reform">
<text>Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) is a politically conservative U.S. advocacy group whose stated goal is &quot;a system in which taxes are simpler, flatter, more visible, and lower than they are today.&quot; According to ATR, &quot;The government&#x27;s power to control one&#x27;s life derives from its power to tax. We believe that power should be minimized.&quot; The organization is known for its &quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot;, which asks candidates for federal and state office to commit themselves in writing to oppose all tax increases. The founder and president of ATR is Grover Norquist, a conservative tax activist.

==Structure==
Americans for Tax Reform is a 501(c)(4) organization with 14 employees, finances of $3,912,958, and a membership of 60,000 (as of 2004). It was founded by Grover Norquist in 1985.

The associated educational wing is the Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, which is classified as a 501(c)(3) research and educational organization. The purpose of both entities is to educate and/or lobby against all tax increases.

===Affiliated organizations===
Americans for Tax Reform is an associate member of the State Policy Network, a U.S. national network of free-market oriented think tanks. Americans for Tax Reform is a grantee of the Donors Trust, a nonprofit donor-advised fund.

==Projects==

===Taxpayer Protection Pledge===
Since 1986, ATR has sponsored the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, a written promise by legislators and candidates for office that commits them to oppose tax increases. All candidates for state and federal office, and all incumbents are offered the Pledge. Nearly 1,400 elected officials, from state representatives, to governors, to US Senators, have signed the Pledge. There are separate versions at the national and state level.

In the version for the U.S. House of Representatives, the signer pledges to:

In the version for state legislators, the signer pledges that:

In the 112th Congress serving in years 2011 and 2012, all but six of the 242 Republican members plus two Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives, for a total of 238 – a majority of that body – as well as all but seven of the 47 Republican members plus one Democratic member of the U.S. Senate, for a total of 41, have signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. All except 13 sitting Republicans have signed the pledge, while three Democrats have signed it (outgoing-Sen. Ben Nelson (NE) and House members Robert Andrews (NJ) and Ben Chandler (KY)).

ATR&#x27;s president Grover Norquist has written about the importance of the &quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot; for many publications including &quot;Human Events&quot; in June 2010. In this article, Norquist writes,

Raising taxes is what politicians do when they don&#x27;t have the strength to actually govern. The taxpayer protection pledge was created in 1986 by Americans for Tax Reform as part of the effort to protect the lower marginal tax rates of Reagan&#x27;s Tax Reform Act of 1986. It has grown in importance as one of the few black-and-white, yes or no, answers that politicians are forced to give to voters before they ask for their vote.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and individual Democratic candidates began attacking &quot;The Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot; and its signers during the 2010 cycle with charges that the pledge protected tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas. The first appearance of the argument arose in the HI-01 special election. Americans for Tax Reform responded by calling the attack ad &quot;blatantly false.&quot; They pointed out that the Pledge does not prohibit any deduction or credit from being eliminated. It only prevents individuals and/or businesses from experiencing an overall increase in income taxes and allows for revenue-neutral tax reform.

The non-partisan, nonprofit Factcheck.org reviewed the DCCC&#x27;s ad and agreed with ATR that the ad was &quot;blatantly false.&quot; The director of Factcheck.org, Brooks Jackson, wrote

It was called &quot;blatantly false&quot; by Americans for Tax Reform, the Republican-leaning group that got Djou&#x27;s signature on its anti-tax pledge. We agree. ATR&#x27;s tax pledge does protect corporations in general – but only from an overall increase in taxes. It says nothing about jobs at all. More important, it does not rule out an overhaul of the tax code. Signers agree to oppose any &quot;net&quot; reduction of deductions or credits &quot;unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.&quot;

According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, the Democrats&#x27; net pickup of eight seats in the House of Representatives in the November 2012 election, combined with several Republicans&#x27; disavowal of the pledge, means that the pledge will no longer have the support of a majority of that chamber when the new Congress convenes in January 2013. Norquist claims that 219 Republicans support the pledge; this figure, however, includes several Republicans who have signed the pledge only to disavow it later.

===Ronald Reagan Legacy Project===
Created in 1997, ATR&#x27;s Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, has worked toward seeing each county in the United States commemorate the former president in a &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;public&quot; way, such as the naming of a public building. The project has also supported efforts to place Reagan on the ten-dollar bill. The project has also encouraged state governors declare February 6 to be &quot;Ronald Reagan Day&quot;; as of 2006, 40 governors have done so.

===Center for Fiscal Accountability===
Since 2008, ATR has sought to encourage transparency and accountability in government through the Center for Fiscal Accountability. The organization&#x27;s mission includes supporting the creation of searchable online databases of government spending, among other initiatives.

===Cost of Government Day===
ATR sponsors the calculation of &quot;Cost of Government Day&quot;, the day on which, by its calculations, &quot;Americans stop working to pay the costs of taxation, deficit spending, and regulations by federal and state governments.&quot; Since 2008 the event has been sponsored by the Center for Fiscal Accountability.

===Property Rights Alliance=== 
The Property Rights Alliance is a project of Americans for Tax Reform. It produces the International Property Rights Index annually, ranking individual rights to own private property in countries worldwide. The index focuses on three main factors. These include: Legal and Political environment (LP), Physical Property Rights (PPR), and Intellectual Property rights (IPR). In 2021 it published a Trade Barrier Index.

===Failure of IRS to protect confidential tax information===

In October 2014 the ATR said that a report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that the IRS has not been safeguarding federal tax information properly. The tax information is gathered by the IRS from the tax returns filed in the United States.

The IRS provides confidential information to over 280 federal, state and local agencies. According to this TIGTA report the IRS&#x27;s Internal Revenue Manual does not require on-site validation of an agency&#x27;s ability to protect federal tax information and does not set any guidelines for an agency&#x27;s background investigation for accessing this information.

The TIGTA report surveyed 15 agencies that receive federal tax information and found that none of them conducted sufficient background checks on employees handling the data: one agency conducted national background investigations, four agencies fingerprint employees and only one checks the sex offender registry. Almost half of the agencies hire convicted criminals.

Federal tax information provided to other agencies must remain confidential by federal law.

===Other projects===
ATR has several special project lines dedicated to specific issues including The American Shareholders Association (ASA), Alliance for Worker Freedom (AWF), and The Media Freedom Project (MFP).

In October 2010 ATR began mailing fliers to voters in Florida directing them to call Florida governor and Independent candidate for Senate, Charlie Crist. ATR&#x27;s mailers included pictures of Crist with Obama and quotes from right wing authors.

==Wednesday meetings==

Shortly after Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1992 election, ATR headquarters became the site of a weekly, off-the-record get-together of conservatives to coordinate activities and strategy. The &quot;Wednesday Meeting&quot; of the Leave Us Alone Coalition soon became an important hub of conservative political organizing. Participants each week include Republican congressional leaders, right-leaning think tanks, conservative advocacy groups and K Street lobbyists. George W. Bush began sending a representative to the Wednesday Meeting even before he formally announced his candidacy for president in 1999, and continued to send representatives after his election in 2000.

ATR has helped to establish regular meetings for conservatives nationwide, modeled after the Wednesday meetings in Washington, with the goal of creating a nationwide network of conservative activists to help support initiatives such as tax cuts and deregulation. There are now meetings in 48 states and more internationally, with meetings in Canada, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

The significance of the Wednesday meeting has influenced liberals and Democrats to organize similar meetings to coordinate activities about their shared agenda. In 2001, &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that Rep. Rosa DeLauro initiated such a meeting at the urging of then-House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, even holding it on a Wednesday.

==Political positions==

The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce the percentage of the GDP consumed by the government. ATR states that it &quot;opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle.&quot; Americans for Tax Reform seeks to curtail government spending by supporting Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) legislation and transparency initiatives, and opposing Democratic efforts to overhaul health care.

ATR is a member of the Cooler Heads Coalition, which denies the scientific consensus on climate change, saying that &quot;the science of global warming is uncertain, but the negative impacts of global warming policies on consumers are all too real.&quot; ATR supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 and continues to favor a comprehensive immigration reform bill.

ATR has called for cuts in the defense budget in order to reduce deficit spending.

===Legislation===
ATR supported the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the calculation method and the rate for the tax credit for qualified research expenses that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent. ATR argued that the bill would be &quot;permanent tax relief for American employers&quot; and pointed to the fact that the credit has been in existence since 1981, but businesses had always faced uncertainty about it due to Congress being forced to renew it 14 times. ATR also argued that businesses already face high corporate income tax rates and that &quot;investment in new technologies and sources of capital is under pressure from other areas of the tax code.&quot;

ATR supports H.R. 6246, the Retirement Inflation Protection Act of 2016. This act is designed to reduce the capital gains tax by reducing the tax on capital gains by the standardized inflation rate over the time period in which the capital was invested. ATR argues that by taxing the capital gains without taking into account the gains that occurred simply due to inflation, that investors are being punished for investing over a long period of time. The organization published an open letter to congressman urging them to vote in favor of the bill, which focuses on the harm that occurs to seniors due to the lack of protections that this bill would provide. This bill was introduced on September 28, 2016 into the U.S. Congress and as of November 2, 2016 has not been voted upon.

===Opposition to free automatic tax return filing and other efforts to make tax filing easier===
Tax preparation in the United States is different from that of many other countries in the world, in that the United States does not provide for taxes to be automatically filed by the tax authority. When it comes time to file taxes, the taxpayer must do it themselves personally, or pay to engage the services of a third-party tax preparer such as Intuit, even though in most cases the IRS already possesses all the information necessary to correctly file taxes for the taxpayer.

For decades, for-profit tax-preparation companies have lobbied Congress to oppose any efforts that make taxes and tax filing simpler or easier for the tax payer. ATR typically joins these efforts to oppose making taxes easier for Americans.

The average taxpayer of Europe spends 15 minutes and no money to file their annual personal taxes, whereas the average American taxpayer spends 8 hours per year and $115 USD. Tax preparers have a vested financial interest in taxes being difficult, with Intuit even going so far as to say in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that federal and local governments making taxes easier to file was a &quot;a continued competitive threat to our business.&quot; ATR&#x27;s interests align with this in that they desire to keep taxes difficult to stoke anti-tax sentiment. That is to say, if paying taxes is &quot;too easy&quot;, then people will be less likely to fight taxes in the way ATR wants.

Norquist and the ATR have publicly argued that things that make tax filing easier on taxpayers constitute an automatic income tax audit on every taxpayer, and serves to keep people uninformed about how taxes work, and was an attempt by the IRS to &quot;socialize all tax preparation in America.&quot; In a 2005 presentation to the President&#x27;s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, Norquist representing the ATR argued that if taxpayers did not have to prepare their own taxes, it &quot;would allow the government to raise revenues invisibly.&quot; While the ATR has argued against efforts that would eliminate reliance on third-party preparers, they have also argued that most Americans should not be required to pay for these third-party services.

===CARES Act===
During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the group received assistance between $150,000 and $350,000 in federally backed small business loans from PNC Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The group stated it would allow them to retain 33 jobs. Their loan was seen as notable, since they (and especially Norquist) campaign against excess government spending and are small-government advocates.

Highlighting the loan amount, Roll Call noted that ATR and ATR Foundation pay Norquist a combined $250,000 annual salary. Norquist also previously criticized the unemployment protection of the CARES Act as &quot;delaying recovery&quot;.

==Involvement with Jack Abramoff==

According to an investigative report from the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on the Jack Abramoff scandal, released in June 2006, ATR served as a &quot;conduit&quot; for funds that flowed from Abramoff&#x27;s clients to finance surreptitiously grass-roots lobbying campaigns. Records show that donations from the Choctaw and Kickapoo tribes to ATR were coordinated in part by Abramoff, and in some cases preceded meetings between the tribes and the White House.

<text>Tanzanite is the blue and violet variety of the mineral zoisite (a calcium aluminium hydroxyl sorosilicate), caused by small amounts of vanadium. Tanzanite belongs to the epidote mineral group. Tanzanite is only found in Simanjiro District of Manyara Region in Tanzania, in a very small mining area approximately long and wide near the Mererani Hills.

Tanzanite is noted for its remarkably strong trichroism, appearing alternately blue, violet and burgundy depending on crystal orientation. Tanzanite can also appear differently when viewed under different lighting conditions. The blues appear more evident when subjected to fluorescent light and the violet hues can be seen readily when viewed under incandescent illumination. In its rough state tanzanite is coloured a reddish brown to clear, and it requires heat treatment to remove the brownish &quot;veil&quot; and bring out the blue violet of the stone. 

The gemstone was given the name &quot;tanzanite&quot; by Tiffany &amp; Co. after Tanzania, the country in which it was discovered. The scientific name of &quot;blue-violet zoisite&quot; was not thought to be sufficiently consumer friendly by Tiffany&#x27;s marketing department, who introduced it to the market in 1968. In 2002, the American Gem Trade Association chose tanzanite as a December birthstone, the first change to their birthstone list since 1912.

==Geology==
Tanzanite was formed around 585 million years ago during the mid-Ediacaran Period by massive plate tectonic activity and intense heat in the area that would later become Mount Kilimanjaro. The mineral is located in a relatively complex geological environment. Deposits are typically found in the &quot;hinge&quot; of isoclinal folds.

==Discovery==
There are many accounts of the discovery of tanzanite, but only one recognised by the government of Tanzania. In January 1967, Jumanne Mhero Ngoma (originally from Same District, Kilimanjaro) stumbled upon the sparkling blue stones at the Mererani hills in the Kiteto district of the then Arusha Region (presently Manyara Region). He was issued with a certificate of recognition three years later by the then President Julius Nyerere and a financial reward of Tsh 50,000 for his efforts. In 1984, he was issued with a certificate for scientific discovery by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology.

==Commercial history==
In July 1967, Manuel de Souza, a Goan tailor and part-time gold prospector living in Arusha, found transparent fragments of blue and blue-purple gem crystals on a ridge near Mererani, some southeast of Arusha. He assumed that the mineral was olivine (peridot) but, after soon realizing it was not, he concluded it was &quot;dumortierite&quot; (a blue non-gem mineral). Shortly thereafter, the stones were shown to John Saul, a Nairobi-based consulting geologist and gemstone wholesaler who was then mining aquamarine in the region around Mount Kenya. Saul, who later discovered the famous ruby deposits in the Tsavo area of Kenya, eliminated dumortierite and cordierite as possibilities, and sent samples to his father, Hyman Saul, vice president at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. Hyman Saul took the samples to the Gemological Institute of America which correctly identified the new gem as a variety of the mineral zoisite. Correct identification was also made by mineralogists at Harvard University, the British Museum and Heidelberg University, but the first person to get the identification right was Ian McCloud, a Tanzanian government geologist based in Dodoma.

Scientifically called &quot;blue zoisite&quot;, the gemstone was renamed as &quot;tanzanite&quot; by Henry B. Platt, a great-grandson of Louis Comfort Tiffany and a vice president of Tiffany &amp; Co., who wanted to capitalize on the rarity and single location of the gem and thought that &quot;blue zoisite&quot; (which might be pronounced like &quot;blue suicide&quot;) would not sell well. Tiffany&#x27;s original campaign advertised that tanzanite could now be found in two places: &quot;in Tanzania and at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

From 1967, an estimated two million carats of tanzanite were mined in Tanzania before the mines were nationalized by the Tanzanian government in 1971.


===Tanzanite mining developments===
In 1990, the Tanzanian government split the tanzanite mines into four sections: Blocks A, B, C and D. Blocks A and C were awarded to large operators, while Blocks B and D were reserved for the local miners. In 2005 the government renewed the lease of Block C mine to TanzaniteOne, who paid US$40 million for their lease and mining license.

In June 2003, the Tanzanian government introduced legislation banning the export of unprocessed tanzanite to India. (Like many gemstones, most tanzanite is cut in Jaipur.) The reason for the ban is to attempt to spur development of local processing facilities, thereby boosting the economy and recouping profits. This ban was phased in over a two-year period, until which time only stones over 0.5 grams were affected. In 2010, the government of Tanzania banned the export of rough stones weighing more than one gram.

TanzaniteOne Mining Ltd is owned by Richland Resources, but a 2010 law in Tanzania required them to cede 50% ownership of their mining license to the Tanzanian State Mining Company (Stamico). Production in 2011 amounted to , earning them $24 million.

Following the construction of a perimeter wall around the mines, to improve security and prevent smuggling, production rose from in 2018 to a record in 2019.

On 24 June 2020, a new record for the world&#x27;s largest rough tanzanite was set after a small-scale miner, Saniniu Laizer, mined two stones of and and sold them to the Government of Tanzania through Ministry of Mining for TSh7.74 billion (US$3.35 million) surpassing a record of stone mined by TanzaniteOne in 2005.

Total reserves of tanzanite are estimated at , according to a report published in 2018. Block C, by far the largest site, has been estimated at with a Life of Mine (LOM) expected to last until the 2040s.

==Factors affecting value: grading==
There is no universally accepted method of grading coloured gemstones. TanzaniteOne, a major commercial player in the tanzanite market, through its non-profit subsidiary, the Tanzanite Foundation, has introduced its own color-grading system. The new system&#x27;s colour-grading scales divide tanzanite colors into a range of hues, between bluish-violet, indigo and violetish-blue.

The normal primary and secondary hues in tanzanite are blue and violet. Untreated tanzanite is a trichroic gemstone, meaning that light that enters this anisotropic crystal gets refracted on different paths, with different colour absorption on each of the three optical axes. As a result of this phenomenon, a multitude of colors have been observed in various specimens: shades of purple, violet, indigo, blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red and brown. After heating, tanzanite becomes dichroic. The dichroic colours range from violet through bluish-violet to indigo and violetish-blue to blue.

Clarity grading in coloured gemstones is based on the eye-clean standard, that is, a gem is considered flawless if no inclusions are visible with the unaided eye (assuming 20/20 vision). The Gemological Institute of America classifies tanzanite as a Type I gemstone, meaning it is normally eye-clean. Gems with eye-visible inclusions will be traded at deep discounts.

===Heat treatment===
Tanzanite forms as a brownish crystal and is trichroic, which means it shows three colours – brown, blue and violet – concurrently. Heating, either underground naturally by metamorphic processes, or artificially, removes the brown or burgundy colour component to produce a stronger violet-blue color and makes the stone &quot;dichroic&quot;, which means it only reflects blue and violet. Rarely, gem-quality tanzanite will heat to a green primary hue, almost always accompanied by a blue or violet secondary hue. These green tanzanite have some meaningful value in the collector market, but are seldom of interest to commercial buyers.

Heat-treating in a furnace is usually carried out at between for 30 minutes. The stones should not have any cracks or bubbles, as they could shatter or the cracks/ bubble could increase in size during furnace heating.

Some stones found close to the surface in the early days of the discovery (in an area now called D block) were gem-quality blue without the need for heat treatment, probably the result of a wildfire in the area which heated the stones underground. This gave rise to the idea that &quot;D block&quot; stones were more desirable than tanzanite found in other areas of the small tanzanite mining area.

Since heat treatment is universal, it has no effect on price, and finished gems are assumed to be heat-treated. Gemological Institute of America states that the source of heating is gemologically undetectable, but is assumed because of its prevalence.

Tanzanite may be subjected to other forms of treatment as well. Recently, coated tanzanites were discovered and tested by the AGTA and AGL laboratories. A thin layer containing cobalt, determined by X-ray fluorescence, had been applied to improve the colour. It was noted that &quot;coatings in particular are not considered permanent&quot;, and in the United States are required to be disclosed at the point of sale.

===Pleochroism in tanzanite===
Pleochroism has a physical property in which the gemstone will appear to have multiple colours based on the angle of the light hitting the stone. Tanzanite is a pleochroic gemstone. Most Tanzanite are blue when viewed from one direction but can vary from violet to red when seeing from a different angle.

The physical characters can make cutting process difficult due to the problem of selecting the perfect color. The finished colour of the gemstone will vary depending on how the table cut reflects the light.

==Imitation and cobalt-coated tanzanite==
, tanzanite has never been successfully synthesized in a laboratory, so all genuine tanzanite is naturally occurring. However, because of its rarity and market demand, tanzanite has been imitated in several ways. Among the materials used for this are cubic zirconia, synthetic spinel, yttrium aluminium garnet, and colored glass. A test of the stone with a dichroscope can easily distinguish these from genuine tanzanite, as only tanzanite will appear doubly refractive: the two viewing windows of the dichroscope will display different colors (one window blue, the other violet) when viewing genuine tanzanite, while the imitation stones are all singly refractive and will cause both windows to appear the same color (violet).

Synthetic forsterite (, the magnesium-rich end-member of olivine) has also been sold as tanzanite, and presents a similar appearance. It can be distinguished from tanzanite in three ways. The first is by using a refractometer: forsterite will show a refractive index of between 1.63 and 1.67, while tanzanite will show a higher index of 1.685 to 1.707. The second way is by using a Hanneman filter: through it, genuine tanzanite will appear orange-pink, while forsterite will appear green. The third way is by examining a cut stone through its crown facets and viewing the pavilion cuts at the back of the stone using a standard jeweller&#x27;s loupe: forsterite will show birefringence, making the pavilion cuts appear &quot;doubled up&quot;, while the much lower birefringence of tanzanite will not have this characteristic.

Lower grades of tanzanite are occasionally enhanced using a layer of cobalt, as cobalt imparts a deeper shade of blue. The cobalt layer does not adhere well to these stones, and tends to rub off over time, resulting in a much less intensely colored stone. Though still tanzanite, the practice of cobalt coating is considered deceptive unless well-advertised.

<doc id="308211" wikidata="Q468514" url="?curid=308211" title="List of best-selling albums in the United States">
<text>The following is a list of the best-selling albums in the United States based on RIAA certification and Nielsen SoundScan sales tracking. The criteria are that the album must have been published (including self-publishing by the artist), and the album must have achieved at least a diamond certification from the RIAA. The albums released prior to March 1991 should be included with their certified units only, as their Nielsen SoundScan sales are not complete.

Since February 2016, album certifications include &quot;on-demand audio and video streams and a track sale equivalent&quot; units.

Groupings are based on different benchmarks; the highest being for at least 20 million units, and the lowest being for multi-disc albums certified at least 10 times platinum and single-disc albums that have been certified at least 10 times platinum but with sales figures lower than 10,000,000. Albums are listed in order of units certified, or sales figures when available, by greatest to least.

As a result of the RIAA&#x27;s methodology of counting each disc in a multi-disc set as one unit toward certification, most double albums on the list—such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; and Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot;—have been certified with a number double the number of copies sold. Such albums have the shipments of copies, not discs, indicated. Conversely, the certification level for double albums that fit onto one compact disc such as the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack reflect the actual number of copies sold.
The albums in this list are ordered first by number of units, then by platinum awards received, and finally by artist name and album title.

Albums with two references for their estimated actual sales include sales through BMG Music Club. Albums with three references for their estimated actual sales include sales through BMG Music Club and Columbia House.

The best-selling album in the United States is &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; by the Eagles.

<doc id="308212" wikidata="Q984205" url="?curid=308212" title="Grover Norquist">
<text>Grover Glenn Norquist (born October 19, 1956) is an American political activist and anti-tax advocate who is founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, an organization that opposes all tax increases. A Republican, he is the primary promoter of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge, a pledge signed by lawmakers who agree to oppose increases in marginal income tax rates for individuals and businesses, and net reductions or eliminations of deductions and credits without a matching reduced tax rate. Prior to the November 2012 election, the pledge was signed by 95% of all Republican members of Congress and all but one of the candidates running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

==Early life and education==
Norquist was born in Sharon, Pennsylvania and grew up in Weston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Carol (née Lutz) and Warren Elliott Norquist, a vice president of Polaroid Corporation, and is of Swedish ancestry. His younger brother, David Norquist, has served in senior posts in Republican administrations at both the United States Department of Defense and the United States Department of Homeland Security and is currently President and CEO of the National Defense Industrial Association. Norquist became involved with politics at an early age when he volunteered for the 1968 Nixon campaign, assisting with get out the vote efforts. He graduated from Weston High School and enrolled at Harvard University in 1974, where he earned his B.A. and MBA.

At college, Norquist was an editor at the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; and helped to publish the libertarian-leaning &quot;Harvard Chronicle&quot;. He was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. Norquist has said: &quot;When I became 21, I decided that nobody learned anything about politics after the age of 21.&quot; He attended the Leadership Institute in Arlington, Virginia, an organization that teaches conservative Americans how to influence public policy through activism and leadership.

==Career==
===Early career===

Early in his career, Norquist was executive director of both the National Taxpayers Union and the national College Republicans, holding both positions until 1983. He served as Economist and Chief Speechwriter at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from 1983 to 1984.

Norquist traveled to several war zones to help support anti-Soviet guerrilla armies in the second half of the 1980s. He worked with a support network for Oliver North&#x27;s efforts with the Nicaraguan Contras and other insurgencies, in addition to promoting U.S. support for groups including Mozambique&#x27;s RENAMO and Jonas Savimbi&#x27;s UNITA in Angola and helping to organize anti-Soviet forces in Laos. In 1985, he went to a conference in South Africa sponsored by South African businesses called the &quot;Youth for Freedom Conference&quot;, which sought to bring American and South African conservatives together to end the anti-apartheid movement. Norquist represented the France-Albert Rene government of Seychelles as a lobbyist from 1995 until 1999. Norquist&#x27;s efforts were the subject of Tucker Carlson&#x27;s 1997 article in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;What I sold at the revolution.&quot;

===Americans for Tax Reform===

Norquist founded Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) in 1985, which he says was done at the request of then-President Ronald Reagan. Referring to Norquist&#x27;s activities as head of ATR, Steve Kroft, in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; episode that aired on November 20, 2011, claimed that &quot;Norquist has been responsible, more than anyone else, for rewriting the dogma of the Republican Party.&quot;

The primary policy goal of Americans for Tax Reform is to reduce government revenues as a percentage of the GDP. ATR states that it &quot;opposes all tax increases as a matter of principle.&quot; Americans for Tax Reform has supported Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) legislation and transparency initiatives, while opposing efforts to regulate health care.

In 1993, Norquist launched his Wednesday Meeting series at ATR headquarters, initially to help fight President Clinton&#x27;s healthcare plan. The meeting eventually became one of the most significant institutions in American conservative political organizing. The meetings have been called &quot;a must-attend event for Republican operatives fortunate enough to get an invitation&quot;, and &quot;the Grand Central station of the conservative movement.&quot; Medvetz (2006) argues that the meetings have been significant in &quot;establishing relations of ... exchange&quot; among conservative subgroups and &quot;sustaining a moral community of conservative activists.&quot;

As a nonprofit organization, Americans for Tax Reform is not required to disclose the identity of its contributors. Critics, such as Sen. Alan Simpson, have asked Norquist to disclose his contributors; he has declined but has said that ATR is financed by direct mail and other grassroots fundraising efforts. According to CBS News, &quot;a significant portion appears to come from wealthy individuals, foundations and corporate interests.&quot;

===Taxpayer Protection Pledge===
Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 House Republicans and 41 out of 47 Senate Republicans had signed ATR&#x27;s &quot;Taxpayer Protection Pledge&quot;, in which the pledger promises to &quot;oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.&quot;

The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to &quot;fewer than ... 218&quot; in the House of Representatives. According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist.

In November 2011, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed Norquist&#x27;s influence for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction&#x27;s lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans &quot;are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They&#x27;re giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader.&quot; Since Norquist&#x27;s pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican deficit hawks now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction. Former Republican Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), co-chairman of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, has been particularly critical, describing Norquist&#x27;s position as &quot;[n]o taxes, under any situation, even if your country goes to hell.&quot;

==Other political activities==
===National politics===

Norquist was listed as one of the five primary leaders of the post-Goldwater conservative movement by Nina Easton in her 2000 book, &quot;Gang of Five&quot;. Working with eventual Speaker Newt Gingrich, Norquist was one of the co-authors of the 1994 Contract with America, and helped to rally grassroots efforts, which Norquist later chronicled in his book &quot;Rock the House.&quot; Norquist also served as a campaign staff member on the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Republican Platform Committees.

Norquist was instrumental in securing early support for the presidential campaign of then-Texas Governor George W. Bush, acting as his unofficial liaison to the conservative movement. He campaigned for Bush in both 2000 and 2004. After Bush&#x27;s first election, Norquist was a key figure involved in crafting Bush&#x27;s tax cuts. John Fund of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; dubbed Norquist &quot;the Grand Central Station&quot; of conservatism and told &quot;The Nation&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not disputable&quot; that Norquist was the key to the Bush campaign&#x27;s surprising level of support from movement conservatives in 2000.

He has been active in building bridges between various ethnic and religious minorities and the free market community through his involvement with Acton Institute, Christian Coalition and Toward Tradition.

He has also &quot;announced his plan to assemble a center-right coalition to discuss pulling out of Afghanistan to save hundreds of billions of dollars.&quot;

Norquist is active in Tea Party politics. Speaking to a Florida rally, he said &quot;tea party groups should serve as the &#x27;exoskeleton&#x27; that protects newly elected Republicans&quot; from pressures to increase government spending.

Comprehensive immigration reform is an interest of Norquist&#x27;s, who believes that the United States should have &quot;dramatically higher levels of immigration&quot; than it currently does.

===Involvement with Jack Abramoff===

According to a 2011 memoir by former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Norquist was one of Abramoff&#x27;s first major Republican party contacts. Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform were also mentioned in Senate testimony relating to the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal, which resulted in a 2006 guilty plea by Abramoff to three criminal felony counts of defrauding of American Indian tribes and corrupting public officials. Records released by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee allege that ATR served as a &quot;conduit&quot; for funds that flowed from Abramoff&#x27;s clients to surreptitiously finance grassroots lobbying campaigns. Norquist denied that he did anything wrong, and has not been charged with any crime.

===State and local politics===

Norquist&#x27;s national strategy has included recruiting state and local politicians to support ATR&#x27;s stance on taxes. Norquist has helped to set up regular meetings for conservatives in many states. These meetings are modeled after his Wednesday meetings in Washington, with the goal of creating a nationwide network of conservative activists that he can call upon to support conservative causes, such as tax cuts and deregulation. There are now meetings in 48 states.

In 2004, Norquist helped California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger with his plan to privatize the CalPERS system. In Virginia&#x27;s 2005 Republican primaries, Norquist encouraged the defeat of a number of legislators who voted for higher taxes.

===Boards and other activities===
Norquist serves on the boards of directors of numerous organizations including the National Rifle Association, the American Conservative Union, the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the Indian-American Republican Caucus, and ParentalRights.org, an organization that wishes to add a Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution. 

In 2010, Norquist joined the advisory board of GOProud, a political organization representing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender conservatives and their allies, for which he was criticized by the Family Research Council. Norquist also sits on a six-person advisory panel that nominates &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s Person of the Year. In business, Norquist was a co-founder of the Merritt Group, later renamed Janus-Merritt Strategies. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 

Norquist signed the &quot;Madrid Charter&quot;, a document drafted by the conservative Spanish political party Vox that describes left-wing groups as enemies of Ibero-America involved in a &quot;criminal project&quot; that are &quot;under the umbrella of the Cuban regime&quot;.

==Views on government==
Norquist favors dramatically reducing the size of government. He has been noted for his widely quoted quip from a 2001 interview with NPR&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition&quot;:

Journalist William Greider quotes Norquist saying his goal is to bring America back to what it was &quot;up until Teddy Roosevelt, when the socialists took over. The income tax, the death tax, regulation, all that.&quot; When asked by journalist Steve Kroft about the goal of chopping government &quot;in half and then shrink it again to where we were at the turn of the [20th] century&quot; before Social Security and Medicare, Norquist replied, &quot;We functioned in this country with government at eight percent of GDP for a long time and quite well.&quot;

Some smaller government advocates argue that Norquist&#x27;s &quot;obsession with tax revenue&quot; is actually counterproductive with respect to minimizing the size of government. Although the Americans for Tax Reform mission statement is &quot;The government&#x27;s power to control one&#x27;s life derives from its power to tax. We believe that power should be minimized&quot;, critics at the Cato Institute have argued that &quot;holding the line on taxes constrains only one of the four tools (taxes, tax deductions, spending without taxation, and regulation) used by government to alter economic outcomes.&quot;

Norquist published &quot;Leave Us Alone: Getting the Government&#x27;s Hands Off Our Money, Our Guns, Our Lives&quot;, in 2008. In 2012, he published &quot;Debacle: Obama&#x27;s War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future&quot;, with John R. Lott, Jr. He has served as a monthly &quot;Politics&quot; columnist and contributing editor to &quot;The American Spectator&quot;.

Norquist has called for reductions in defense spending as one way to reduce the size of government. He has endorsed a non-interventionist foreign policy and cuts to the U.S. military budget.

==Personal life==
Norquist has described himself as a &quot;boring white bread Methodist.&quot; In 2004, at age 48, he married a Muslim named Samah Alrayyes, public relations specialist who was formerly a director of the Islamic Free Market Institute and a specialist at the Bureau of Legislative and Public Affairs at U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The couple has adopted two children, both girls, one of whom is from the city of Bethlehem.

According to friend and former roommate John Fund, Norquist&#x27;s devotion to his political causes is &quot;monk-like&quot; and comparable to that of Ralph Nader.

Norquist has competed three times in the comedy fundraiser &quot;Washington&#x27;s Funniest Celebrity&quot; and placed second in 2009. Humorist P. J. O&#x27;Rourke has described Norquist as &quot;Tom Paine crossed with Lee Atwater plus just a of Madame Defarge&quot;.

Norquist and his wife attended the annual Burning Man festival in Black Rock, Nevada in August 2014. Norquist explained that he wished to attend because, &quot;There&#x27;s no government that organizes this. That&#x27;s what happens when nobody tells you what to do. You just figure it out. So Burning Man is a refutation of the argument that the state has a place in nature.&quot;

<text>Juan Antonio Flecha Giannoni (born 17 September 1977) is an Argentine-born Spanish former professional road bicycle racer, who competed as a professional between 2000 and 2013. Flecha had a reputation of being a Classics specialist and to ride with an aggressive style as he was keen on participating in breakaways. His major victories include winning a stage of the 2003 Tour de France, successes at the two defunct classics Züri-Metzgete and Giro del Lazio in 2004, and the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad in 2010. He was also known for his numerous high placings in important one-day races, most notably Paris–Roubaix, where he finished in the top ten eight times without registering the victory. In the Grand Tours, he was often assigned to a role of domestique.

==Early life==
Flecha spent his early years in Argentina. His father died in a car accident when he was four years of age. He moved to Spain with his mother when he was eleven, where they lived in Sitges, near Barcelona.

==Professional Cycling Career==

===Early years===
He gained fame in 2003 when he became the first rider born in Argentina to win a Tour de France stage while riding for . As he rode across the finish line he performed a unique victory salute: he pantomimed releasing an arrow from a bow in homage to his family name (&quot;Flecha&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;arrow&quot;). Although he said in a French interview, &quot;Je dédie ma victoire a toute mon équipe&quot;, (I dedicate my victory to my whole team), it was also reported that he said after the race: &quot;My win here is special, and it belongs to me and nobody else!&quot;

The 2004 season saw him as a co-leader in the Italian team for the Classics and one-day races, with notable finishes in various races from the Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and victories in Züri-Metzgete and the Giro del Lazio. He often shared team leadership with Swiss rider Fabian Cancellara, with whom he said he was working very well. In Züri-Metzgete, he won a 30 rider bunch gallop in front of Italian Paolo Bettini. This victory helped him achieve the fifth position of the 2004 UCI Road World Cup, a classification that was calculated over ten major one-day races.

===2005===

The following season with Fassa Bortolo in 2005 saw Flecha involved in a controversial finish at Gent–Wevelgem, where he had to settle for second. Nico Mattan of attacked the leading group with left in the race and only Flecha and Baden Cooke () had the resources to follow. Flecha then placed an attack of his own and dropped the two men. It looked like he was on his way to success when Mattan got back to him in the last kilometer by using the slipstream produced by the race&#x27;s cars, which is not allowed, and beat Flecha for the line. A couple of days later, he finished on the third step of the podium in Paris–Roubaix, a confirmation of his skills in the cobbled classics. He entered the Roubaix Velodrome with Tom Boonen and George Hincapie, but his sprinting speed was not sufficient to get the win. rider Egoi Martínez said in an interview that in a race &quot;one should have a head and an attitude like the one Juan Antonio Flecha has&quot;, in tribute to his perseverance and positive attitude in racing.

When the Fassa Bortolo team closed down after the 2005 season, Flecha moved on to Dutch team . In 2007, Flecha took 2nd in the prestigious Paris–Roubaix race by winning the sprint contested between the 4 riders who were chasing the winner, Aussie Stuart O&#x27;Grady ().

===2008===

In the Vuelta a España, Flecha displayed his sense of humor as he stole the &quot;Elk Man&quot;&#x27;s American flag and rode playfully with it for 200 meters. In October, he grabbed his first victory since joining the team in the four-stage race Circuit Franco-Belge. He was fourth at 18 seconds before heading in to the final stage, which was contested in heavy rain and cold temperatures. He escaped from a group of 24 riders with Sébastien Rosseler of and finished in second position of the stage, putting enough time between him and the former leader Jürgen Roelandts () to be awarded the overall classification win.

===2009===

Flecha took the third step of the podium in the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, formerly known as the Omloop Het Volk. He was part of a group of chasers who caught the two escapees Heinrich Haussler () and Sebastian Langeveld () in the final meters, as the duet didn&#x27;t want to cooperate. Haussler&#x27;s teammate Thor Hushovd won the sprint as Flecha finished third while a crash occurred in the finale, implicating Langeveld and Filippo Pozzato (). In the third stage of Paris–Nice, he was outsprinted by Sylvain Chavanel and took second place, while he was part of a break of seven riders. Flecha participated in the cobbled classic Paris–Roubaix, and was in a good position to seek victory as he was in the leading group with five competitors, Tom Boonen, Leif Hoste, Thor Hushovd, Filippo Pozzato and Johan Van Summeren. About away from the Roubaix velodrome, Flecha crashed in a left bend on the Carrefour de l&#x27;Arbre, a particularly tough cobbled section. He could not rejoin the leaders and finished sixth, while Boonen won the event. With again no victories in the 2009 season, Flecha declined a new offer from team Rabobank. He felt it was time for a new challenge.

===2010===
In 2010, he joined . At the beginning of the season, he participated in his squad&#x27;s victory at the Team time trial of the Tour of Qatar. He got his first major one-day race victory with his new team in the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, becoming the first Spanish rider to win the event. He counter-attacked Philippe Gilbert on a cobbled section before making a solo effort for the finish. He dedicated the win to his team and to his former teammate Frank Vandenbroucke who died in October 2009. In March he took the third step of the podium in the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen behind eternal classic rivals Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara. The three of them had broken clear with more than to cover and cooperated to keep the chasers at bay, until Cancellara launched an attack with 2 kilometers remaining and won the race with a sizable gap. Flecha was out sprinted by Boonen for the second place. Two weeks later at Paris–Roubaix, he took another third place after breaking away from the chasers with Thor Hushovd in a vain attempt to reach Cancellara. The latter escaped shortly before the cobbled sector Mons-en-Pévèle and would be untouchable on that day, while Hushovd&#x27;s sprinting speed proved too much for Flecha. Tom Boonen was upset that Flecha and the chasing group didn&#x27;t bring back Cancellara in a concerted effort and made comments to that effect, but he didn&#x27;t follow Flecha and Hushovd when they attacked.

Flecha went on to compete in the Tour de France in service of his leader Bradley Wiggins, who struggled in the mountains and finished 24th overall. However, Flecha earned the Combativity award in stage 13, where he animated the race thanks to a long escape with Pierrick Fedrigo of and &#x27;s Sylvain Chavanel. The trio was reeled in at the foot of the final climb.

===2011===
At the very short prologue of the Tour of Qatar, Flecha survived a scare when a gust of wind knocked down some steel barriers as he was sprinting for the line. He managed to stay upright after skillfully negotiating the steel bars, with his back wheel slipping on the metallic surface. Despite the incident, he took the fourth place of the stage, and later on the fourth place of the whole Tour, 26 seconds down on Mark Renshaw (). In February, Flecha looked to repeat his win of 2010 at the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. In wet conditions, he broke away from a group containing some race favorites on the Paaderstraat, with about to go, and caught the only man in front of him, &#x27;s Sebastian Langeveld. Flecha launched an attack with to cover, but Langeveld bridged the gap. The two were set to battle it out in the sprint, with Langeveld refusing to take pulls and Flecha going so far as to roll on the sidewalk to force his opponent to do some work in the front. Langeveld finally prevailed by a few inches on the line.
At the Tour de France&#x27;s ninth stage, Flecha was involved in a dramatic crash after he was sideswiped by a France Télévisions car, causing fellow breakaway rider, Johnny Hoogerland to crash into a barbed wire fence. He was treated on his bike for an injured elbow and finished the stage. He shared the Combativity award with Hoogerland for that stage. Flecha subsequently won a criminal case brought against the car&#x27;s driver in the year after the crash and was awarded 10,000 Euros. On stage 16, Flecha attacked relentlessly trying to create a break during the first stages of the race, developing an average power of 297 watts over the whole race.

===2012===
At the beginning of the year, Flecha took the third place overall at the Tour of Qatar, thanks to a good placing on the fourth stage, as it was the only stage that didn&#x27;t conclude in a mass sprint apart from the short team time trial. Back in Europe, he finished third in the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, signing a podium finish for the fourth year in a row in this classic. He followed a strong attack by &#x27;s Sep Vanmarcke on the cobbled sector &#x27;Lange Munte&#x27; with Tom Boonen. Flecha tried his luck in the final kilometers but was outsprinted by the pair, with Vanmarcke taking the win. He had to withdraw from the Tirreno–Adriatico because of a fracture to the metacarpal bone in his hand suffered in training. According to Danny Nelissen of Eurosport, it was the result of some sheninagans with a motorist.
Flecha healed in time to be able to participate to Paris–Roubaix, looking for a victory as he finished in the &quot;top 10&quot; of the Classic six times in the last 7 years, without ever winning it. He was part of a small group including his teammate Mathew Hayman who tried to bring back Tom Boonen from his solo breakaway initiated with to race, but they could not get to him. He entered the velodrome in Roubaix with two fellow escapees, but two other riders joined them as they were circling the track for the final kilometer of racing. A sprint ensued and Flecha took the fourth place of the Hell of the North race. Flecha got another notable result in June, coming in fourth place of the mostly flat Ster ZLM Toer, a 2.1 rated stage race. His teammate Mark Cavendish won the event.

In the Vuelta a España, Flecha rode in support of his leader, Chris Froome. In Stage 13, he broke away with six other men after the first hour of racing. The breakaway made it through and Flecha finished third, four seconds behind Steve Cummings of the squad. He won the Combativity award for his efforts.

Flecha left Team Sky at the end of the year and signed a one-year contract to ride with in 2013. He stated that the change of teams will give him more freedom to attack and be himself rather than giving up personal ambitions as was the case with Team Sky.
===2013===
Flecha&#x27;s first significant result of the 2013 campaign came in the Gent–Wevelgem race, where he attacked early with to cover. He was joined and was part of the lead group when Peter Sagan soloed to victory, and he took the 5th place in the ensuing sprint containing 9 riders. He once again finished in the &quot;top 10&quot; of Paris–Roubaix, taking the eight place as part of a small group that finished 39 seconds in arrears of the winner, Fabian Cancellara. In April, the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant published a story where Flecha is alleged to have undergone blood transfusions with doctor Eufemiano Fuentes. The news outlet alleges that the rider codenamed &quot;Clasicomano&quot; and &quot;33&quot; in the Operacion Puerto case is Flecha. Flecha denied the allegations and his team stood by him and promised to investigate further. The Vacansoleil team folded at the end of the season and Flecha decided to retire. His last race was the Tour of Beijing in October.

==Television career==
Flecha is often featured as a co-host to Eurosport&#x27;s Grand Tours extra programming, sometimes riding the key points of the course by bike, prior to the riders, with an integrated camera and stopping along the way to share his comments. He also interviews riders after the race.

<text>The Pipil are an indigenous group of Mesoamerican people inhabiting the western and central areas of present-day El Salvador and Nicaragua.They are a subgroup of the larger Nahua ethnic group. They speak the Nawat language, which is a closely related but distinct language from the Nahuatl of Central Mexico. There are very few speakers of Nawat left, but there are efforts being made to revitalize it.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the Pipil were also present around Escuintla, Guatemala and in various parts of Honduras.The Nawat language has already gone extinct in these countries, but there is a small population of acculturated Nahuas in eastern Honduras.

Their cosmology is related to that of the Toltec, Maya and Lenca.

==History==
Indigenous accounts recorded by Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Francisco de Oviedo suggest that the Pipil of El Salvador migrated from present-day Mexico to their current locations beginning around the 8th century A.D. They traveled from current day central Mexico to the Gulf coast. After a short period of time, they then travelled southwards through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, ending their journey on the Balsam Coast of El Salvador. As they settled in the area, they founded the city-state of Kūskatan, which was already home to various groups including the Lenca, Xinca, Ch&#x27;orti&#x27;, and Poqomam.

The Nahua, a cohesive group sharing a central Mexican culture, are said to have migrated to Central America during the Late Classic and Early Postclassic period. The Nahua are linguistically tied to the Aztec, so it is likely that both were descended from the Toltecs. The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries saw a Nahua diaspora across Central America, which the Pipil were a part of.

The Pipil organized the confederacy, Kūskatan, with at least two centralized city-states that may have been subdivided into smaller principalities. A common feature of Nahua societies was a grouping of settlements who all had symmetric relationships with the others, rather than one dominant city. They were also competent workers in cotton textiles and developed a wide-ranging trade network for woven goods as well as agricultural products. Their cultivation of cacao, centered in the Izalco area and involving a vast and sophisticated irrigation system, was especially lucrative, and trade reached as far north as Teotihuacan and south to Costa Rica.

Near the coast, cotton and indigo were produced as well as cacao. However, a rival confederation of the Tz&#x27;utujil and K&#x27;iche people began to settle that area, in a deliberate attempt to control the resources of the area. This may be the reason that archeological evidence of continuous Pipil occupation is lacking compared to other cultures that had more permanent stays in the same areas.

When their presence was documented by the Spanish in the 16th century, they were identified as &quot;Pipil&quot; and located in the present areas of western El Salvador, as well as south-eastern Guatemala. Poqomam Maya settlements were interspersed around the area of Chalchuapa.

Some urban centers developed into present-day cities, such as Sonsonate and Ahuachapán. Ruins in Aguilares and those close to the Guazapa volcano are considered to have been Nahua establishments.

==Language, etymology, and synonymy==

The term &quot;Nahua&quot; is a cultural and ethnic term used for Nahuan-speaking groups. Though they are &quot;Nahua,&quot; the term &quot;Pipil&quot; is the term that is most commonly encountered in anthropological and linguistic literature. This exonym derives from the closely related Nahuatl word &quot;pil&quot; (meaning &#x27;boy&#x27;). The term &quot;Pipil&quot; has often been explained as originating as a derogatory reference made by the Aztecs, who presumably regarded the Nawat language as a childish version of their own language, Nahuatl. However, the Nahua do not refer to themselves as &quot;Pipil&quot;. There is evidence that the Pipil were able to understand Nahuatl, as the Spanish were able to communicate with Pipil they encountered in Nahuatl. Nahuatl was used as a &quot;vehicular language&quot; at that time, because many different groups could speak Nahuatl, so groups with unintelligible languages to each other could communicate. However, unlike in Nahuatl, honorifics for religious concepts do not include complex honorifics added to nouns, prepositions, and verbs. Which may have been further reasoning on why the Aztecs believed they spoke a degraded version of Nahuatl. Because of this when Spanish evangelicals came to indoctrinate Pipil the Pipil didn&#x27;t understand them. Causing trouble in indoctrinating them into Christianity and making the friars learn their unique patterns.

Archaeologist William Fowler notes that the term &quot;Pipil&quot; can be translated as &#x27;noble&#x27; and surmises that the invading Spanish and their Indian auxiliaries, the Tlaxcala, used the name as a reference to the population&#x27;s elite, known as the Pipiltin. The Pipiltin were land owners and composed a sovereign society state during the Toltec expansion.

For most authors, the term &quot;Pipil&quot; or &quot;Nawat (Nahuat)&quot; is used to refer to the language in Central America only (i.e., excluding Mexico). However, the term (along with the synonymous &quot;Eastern Nahuatl&quot;) has also been used to refer to Nahuan language varieties in the southern Mexican states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Chiapas, that, like the Nawat in El Salvador, have reduced the earlier /tl/ sound to a /t/. The varieties spoken in these three areas do share greater similarities with Nawat than the other Nahuan varieties do, which suggests a closer connection; however, Campbell (1985) considers Nawat distinct enough to be a language separate from the Nahuan branch, thus rejecting an &quot;Eastern Nahuatl&quot; subgrouping that includes Nawat.

Dialects of Nawat include the following:
* Izalco
* Nahuizalco
* Panchimalco
* Cuisnahuat
* Santo Domingo de Guzmán
* Santa Catarina Mazagua
* Teotepeque
* Tacuba
* Ataco 
* Jicalapa
* Comazagua
* Chiltiupan

Today, Nawat is seldom used by the general population. It is mostly used in rural areas, mostly as phrases sustained in households, such as in the Sonsonate and Ahuachapán departments. Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán have the highest concentration of Nawat speakers. Campbell&#x27;s 1985 estimate (fieldwork 1970-1976) was 200 remaining speakers although as many as 2000 speakers have been recorded in official Mexican reports. Gordon (2005) reports only 20 speakers (from 1987). The exact number of Native Nawat speakers is difficult to determine because many speakers have wished to remain unidentified, this is due to historic government repression of Indigenous Salvadorans. The most known example of this being &quot;La Matanza&quot; (&quot;The Massacre&quot;) of 1932, where an estimated 40,000 Indigenous Salvadorans were executed by the government. This event caused many Indigenous Salvadorans who survived to stop passing on their Native language, traditions, and other cultural practices to their descendants. Many also stopped wearing traditional Indigenous clothing out of fear.

==Spanish conquest==
In the early 16th century, the Spanish conquistadores ventured into Central America from Mexico, then known as the Spanish colony of New Spain. After subduing the highland Mayan city-states through battle and cooptation, the Spanish sought to extend their dominion to the lower pacific region of the Nahua, then dominated by the powerful city-state of Cuscatlán. Pedro de Alvarado, a lieutenant of Hernán Cortés, led the first Spanish invasion in June 1524. He was accompanied by thousands of Tlaxcala and Cakchiquel allies, who had long been rivals of Cuzcatlan for control over their wealthy cacao-producing region. The Nahua warriors met the Spanish forces in two major open battles that send the Spanish army retreating back to Guatemala. The Spaniards eventually returned with reinforcements. The surviving Cuscatlán forces retreated into the mountains, where they sustained a guerrilla war against the allies of the Spanish, who had occupied the city of Cuscatlán. Unable to defeat this resistance, and with Pedro de Alvarado nursing a painful leg wound from an arrow in the first battle in Acajutla beach, Diego de Alvarado was forced to lead the rest of the conquest. Two subsequent Spanish expeditions were required to achieve the complete defeat of Cuzcatan, in 1525 and again in 1528.

According to legend, a Nahua Cacique or Lord named Atlácatl and Lord Atunal Tut led the Pipil forces against first contact with the Spanish, the most famous battle being the Battle of Acajutla led by Atunal. The Annals of the Cakchiquels mentions the name &quot;Pan Atacat&quot; (water men), in reference to coastal Nahua (this may have been a title for war chiefs or coastal warriors).

At the start of colonization, the Pipil continued in some senses their own way of life after the Spanish conquest. This was due to the economic system the Spaniards put in place in El Salvador. Settling mostly in the western side of El Salvador they incorporated the Indigenous populations into their new social and political order. with the Spaniards collecting and selling the products Indigenous people produced, because the Indigenous populations were much better at cultivating the native crops in the region especially the lucrative cacao plant. However, their cities were forced to realign themselves into grid plan cities according to the Spanish custom. In Ciudad Vieja, a settlement containing many Pipil as well as Spaniards, many examples of Pipil pottery and obsidian artifacts were found, as well as metalwork that was clearly of Spanish origin. The dense, grid plan city was ruled by the Spanish, but many Pipil living there made a life in which they continued to keep in touch with their indigenous customs. For the Pipil population that stayed inside the Spanish rule they were forced to stop native crop cultivate and start farming Cacao. The Spanish also passed a tax on the Cacao from the family heads, by 1590 the Pipil population was 20% of what it was pre conquest.

While some Pipil continued to live in strongholds in Western and Central El Salvador, by 1892 reports say most of the population in El Salvador was Spanish monolingual. This was attributed to it being easier to learn Spanish and have a chance of making it out of the Pipil communities and fully assimilate into the now Spanish El Salvador instead of living under the oppressive taxes and work.

The Spanish were dedicated to the chronicling of the people who they were colonizing, and as such wrote at length about the Pipil. However, many of the sources are of unknown accuracy, as some do not cite any sources, and some carry obvious biases. Despite this, several sources have good information that historians have referred to in the absence of the original manuscripts to which they refer, many of which were destroyed by the Spanish.

After the Spanish victory, the Nahua of Kuskatan became vassals of the Spanish Crown and were no longer referred to as &quot;Pipiles&quot; by the Spanish but simply &quot;indios&quot; (Indians), in accordance with the Vatican &quot;Discovery doctrine&quot;. The term &quot;Pipil&quot; has therefore remained associated, in mainstream Salvadoran rhetoric, with the pre-conquest indigenous culture. Today it is used by scholars to distinguish the indigenous population in El Salvador from other Nahua-speaking groups (e.g., in Nicaragua). However, neither the self-identified indigenous population nor its political movement, which has revived in recent decades, uses the term &quot;pipil&quot; to describe themselves but instead uses terms such as &quot;Nawataketza&quot; (a speaker of Nawat) or simply &quot;indígenas&quot; (indigenous).

== Pipil Archaeology ==
The archaeological study of the broader Nahua peoples of Meso and Central America has been widespread and thorough. However, studies devoted to the Pipil specifically are rarer, but still important.

A bulk of Pipil focused archaeological research has gone into deciphering the exact migrational route that the Pipil took from central Mexico to El Salvador, and where exactly they first settled. This includes the tracking of their path to the Gulf Coast through remaining Nawat speakers and their traversal of the Isthmus of Mexico. Much of the research on this topic has also sought to illuminate why they chose the Western Balsam coast as their destination, and why they migrated at all. Escamilla Rodriguez has asserted that to a certain extent, the early pipil sites studied on the Balsam coast of El Salvador were changed and appropriated by the settlers as part of a diasporic migration process, maintaining their identities through alteration of their landscape.  

Archeological study of Pipil art, especially through the 16th and 17th centuries, has also been thorough. Apart from the study of traditional art, archaeologists have looked at the development of Pipil artisanship through Spanish colonization. During Spanish colonization, when Pipil artisans were indentured to the conquistadors, studies have found that much of their traditional pottery was influenced by the European trends brought in by the Spanish. Analysis showed how even though the pottery created by the Pipil artists was ornamented with traditional indigenous decoration, the forms of the pieces themselves were frequently European. Jeb Card sites this artistic influence as evidence for ethnogenesis during the long rule of the Spanish.

Pipil writing forms, apart from being analyzed linguistically, have also been studied archaeologically as a fundamental part of unique Pipil culture. Archaeologists analyzing Pipil writings have discovered strong emphasis on currency and commodity, pointing towards an economically advanced pre-colonial culture. Kathryn Sempeck, among others, upholds Pipil’s unique style of writing, especially involving politics and economics, as a deliberate demonstrator of Pipil independence and cultural separation from the Aztec and the Mixtec, with whom they share a geographic origin.

== Pipil resistance ==
In 1881 there were several small rebellions launched, after the El Salvadorean government passed a decree that abolished the ejido system and the tieras comunales. The communal common lands where Pipil continued to farm their crops and pay tribute to the government. This effectively placed all Pipil people in poverty as they could no longer farm.

La Matanza: In 1932 the Pipil and communists (mostly El Salvadorean peasants wanting land reform) started a rebellion against the El Salvadorean government and their well-trained and armed army. The government responded with the indiscriminate massacre of a conservative 30,000 Indigenous people over the course of a few days. Peasants were rounded up arms tied behind their back and shot. U.S. Historian Thomas Andeson who studied the Massace wrote &quot;The extermination was so great that they could not be buried fast enough, and a great stench of rotting flesh permeated the air of Western El Salvador.&quot;

Today the Pipil people still continue to resist oppression by spreading their culture and continuing traditional practices.

==Modern Nahua Culture==
Popular accounts of the Nahua have had a strong influence on the national oral histories of El Salvador, with a large portion of the population claiming ancestry from the Pipil and other groups. Some 86% of today&#x27;s Salvadorans self-report as Mestizos (people of mixed Amerindian and European descent). A small percentage (estimated by the government at 1 percent, by UNESCO at 2 percent, and by scholars at between 2 and 4 percent) is of solely or nearly solely Indigenous ancestry, although the numbers are disputed for political reasons. There are still Natives who speak Nawat (Nahuat) and follow traditional ways of life. They live mainly in the southwest part of the country in small villages, but numerous self-identified Indigenous populations live in other areas, such as the Nonualcos south of the capital and the Lenca in the east.

Remaining self-identified El Salvadorian native cultures other than the Pipil include the Lenca, Pokoman, Chorti, and Ulva peoples. The Pipil, however, are descendants of the central Mexican peoples who would form the Aztecs, making them unique in cultural history to other native peoples currently situated in El Salvador. The Pipil remain the only substantial population of central Mexican-originating peoples in El Salvador.

In the mid 1900s the majority of people in El Salvador believed there was no indigenous peoples left in El Salvador as the majority of education in Central America emphasized a blended Mestizo culture that could unite countries through the struggles of development and civil wars. With most in the capital of San Salvador saying there wasn&#x27;t any left in the whole of El Salvador, this was not the case as estimates of Indigenous populations in 1975 were that of around 500,000 making up approximately 10 percent of the Salvadorean population. In this time period archeologists and anthropologists called the Indigenous peoples of El Salvador an Invisible population similar to how blacks were treated in the US.

According to a special report in &quot;El Diario de Hoy&quot;, due to preservation and revitalization efforts of various non-profit organizations in conjunction with several universities, combined with a post-civil war resurgence of Nahua identity in the country of El Salvador, the number of Nawat speakers rose from 200 in the 1980s to 3,000 speakers in 2009. The vast majority of these speakers are young people, a fact that may allow the language to be pulled from the brink of extinction. Nawat (Nahuat) language revitalization efforts are currently being made today, in and outside of El Salvador.

There is also a renewed interest in the preservation of traditional Indigenous customs and other Indigenous cultural practices, as well as a greater willingness by Indigenous Salvadoran communities to perform their ceremonies in public, and to wear traditional Indigenous clothing without fear of government repression. Traditional Pipil cuisine is gaining popularity, known of its use of unique flavor combinations and natural ingredients like corn, green tomatoes and chilis including pupusas (&quot;see Pupusa)&quot; and atol de elote.

<text>David Robert Peterson (born December 28, 1943) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician who served as the 20th premier of Ontario from 1985 to 1990. He was the first Liberal officeholder in 42 years, ending the so-called Tory dynasty.

==Background==
Peterson was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Clarence Marwin Peterson (1913–2009) and Laura Marie Scott (1913–2015), and has two siblings, former MPP Tim Peterson and former MP Jim Peterson. His parents were both born in Saskatchewan. His father was born to Norwegian immigrant farmers who had previously homesteaded in North Dakota. In the early 1930s, Clarence Peterson joined the newly-formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and was present at the conference where it adopted the Regina Manifesto. Looking for work during the Great Depression, he moved to Ontario and in 1936 was living in Toronto, where he found a job as a salesman with Union Carbide. The job eventually took him to London, Ontario, where he worked for the company for several years before establishing a wholesale electronics business, C.M. Peterson Co. Ltd, in 1944. He was elected to city council as an alderman in the early 1950s and joined the Ontario Liberal Party, running as its candidate in the 1955 Ontario general election in London North, losing to future premier John Robarts, and ran again as a federal Liberal candidate in 1963 in London.

Peterson grew up in London and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario in political science and philosophy and his law degree from the University of Toronto. He was called to the bar in 1969. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1980 and later was appointed to the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada in 1992 by Brian Mulroney.

At the age of twenty-six, he became president of C.M. Peterson Company Limited, a wholesale electronics firm founded by his father. He holds four Honorary degrees including a doctor of laws from the University of Western Ontario and is a knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour of France and a member of the Order of La Pléiade. In 2009, he became a member of the Order of Ontario.

Peterson married actress Shelley Matthews in 1974 and they have since raised three children. He is the younger brother of Jim Peterson (1941–2024), formerly a federal Liberal MP and cabinet minister. Both his sister-in-law Deb Matthews and his brother, Tim Peterson, were elected to the Ontario legislature in the 2003 provincial election while Deb Matthews was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2014.

==Politics==
Peterson was elected as the Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament for London Centre in the 1975 provincial election. Less than one year later, he campaigned for the leadership of the party following Robert Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Despite his inexperience, Peterson nevertheless came within 45 votes of defeating Stuart Smith on the third and final ballot of a delegated convention held on January 25, 1976. Smith presented an image of an articulate intellectual who some delegates said reminded them of Pierre Trudeau while Peterson came across as similar to then Premier Bill Davis. Convention delegates also thought that Peterson, a neophyte MPP at 31 years old, was too young and his convention address which he later characterized as the &quot;worst speech in modern political history&quot; came across as stilted and over rehearsed.

Peterson was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1977 and 1981. He ran again for the Liberal leadership in 1982, after Smith resigned.

The convention was held on February 21, 1982. This time his convention speech was better. Although not very inspiring, it was viewed as &#x27;statesmanlike&#x27; and effective. He won on the second ballot defeating the more left-leaning Sheila Copps with 55% of the vote. In his acceptance speech Peterson said that he would move party to the &#x27;vibrant middle, the radical centre&#x27;, and stressed economic growth as a way to increase support for social services. Observers from the other parties felt he was trying to move the Liberal party more to the right, away from values that Smith promoted.

===Liberal leader===
Peterson worked to pay off the party&#x27;s debt from the 1981 election and accomplished that by the end of the year and was working on long-term debt. Peterson performed well as opposition leader and was popular in the press. The party started to use him as a label rather than &#x27;Liberal&#x27; referring to &#x27;David Peterson&#x27;s Ontario&#x27;. A by-election loss to the NDP was attributed to dislike of Federal Liberals. In 1984, a Liberal backbencher, J. Earl McEwen crossed the floor to join the Tories. In 1984, four of the party&#x27;s senior MPPs quit provincial politics to run for the federal Liberal government led by John Turner, who had just won the party leadership to succeed a retiring Pierre Trudeau as Prime Minister; ending up the federal Liberals&#x27; support collapsed and they were badly defeated in the election by Brian Mulroney. Polling in late 1984 showed Peterson&#x27;s Liberals consistently trailing behind the Progressive Conservatives. Premier Davis still polled as the most popular leader.

Peterson&#x27;s fortunes improved when Davis retired as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in early 1985. His successor, Frank Miller, took the party further to the right, and was unable to convince the electorate of his leadership abilities. Though Miller&#x27;s Tories began the election in 1985 with a significant lead, Peterson&#x27;s Liberals gradually increased their support throughout the campaign. Peterson frequently campaigned in his red jogging suit and projected the image of a younger urban leader, contrasting with Miller who was increasingly seen as too old and rural. To the surprise of many, Peterson won a narrow plurality of the popular vote. However, at the time rural areas were still slightly over represented in the Legislative Assembly. As a result, the Liberals won 48 seats, while the Progressive Conservatives 52 which was enough for a minority government.

Shortly after the election, NDP leader Bob Rae called Peterson to negotiate. Rae also initiated talks with Premier Miller but the talks with the Liberals proved more fruitful. Rae and Peterson signed a &quot;Liberal-NDP Accord&quot; in which the NDP agreed to support a Liberal government in office for two years. The Liberals, in turn, agreed to implement some policies favoured by the NDP. Rae wanted to have a coalition with representation in cabinet but Peterson indicated that he would not accept a coalition. To make sure the public would not misconstrue the agreement as a coalition, Peterson made sure that there would be no photos of him and Rae signing the agreement.

===Premier of Ontario===
==== Leadership style ====
The Liberals and NDP defeated Miller&#x27;s government on June 18, 1985, when Rae introduced a motion of no confidence on the speech from the throne. Peterson was sworn in as Premier of Ontario eight days later. Peterson&#x27;s top three cabinet ministers were Robert Nixon as Treasurer, Sean Conway as Education Minister, and Ian Scott as Attorney General.

After the expiration of the Liberal-NDP Accord in 1987, the Liberals called another provincial election, and won the second-largest majority government in Ontario&#x27;s history, taking 95 seats out of 130, at the expense of the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives who dropped to third place in the legislature. After the 1987 election, Peterson told the newly enlarged caucus at their first meeting that his popularity may have got most of them elected, but warned that he would likely need their help getting re-elected next time, since he understood that his massive victory had created expectations that simply couldn’t be met. 

==== Domestic policy ====

Peterson&#x27;s government introduced several pieces of progressive legislation. It eliminated &quot;extra billing&quot; by doctors, brought in pay equity provisions, and reformed the province&#x27;s rent review and labour negotiation laws. His government also brought in pension reform, expanded housing construction, and resolved a long-standing provincial controversy by honouring the Davis Tories promise to extend full funding to Catholic secondary schools. Peterson was also a vocal opponent of free trade with the United States in 1988. His administration was less activist in its later years, though it still introduced progressive measures on environmental protection, eliminated health insurance premiums, and brought in no-fault automobile insurance for the province.

Peterson&#x27;s prominent role in creating and promoting the &quot;Meech Lake&quot; constitutional accord gained criticism from some. While initially popular, this attempt at revising Canada&#x27;s constitution proved extremely divisive in most of English-speaking Canada. Many believed that it gave too many concessions to Quebec, while others believed that it weakened the federal government&#x27;s authority in relation to the provinces. Peterson&#x27;s continued support for the accord, in the face of increased opposition, damaged his personal popularity in Ontario. The accord was not endorsed by Manitoba and Newfoundland, and did not pass. As Ontario&#x27;s economy slowed down, the public also questioned Peterson&#x27;s devotion to nation-building issues such as the Meech Lake Accord, instead of &quot;more mundane kitchen-table issues such as rising taxes and skyrocketing auto-insurance premiums&quot;.

Peterson and the Liberals also faced controversy over the Patti Starr affair. Starr, a prominent Liberal fundraiser, was found to have improperly diverted money from a land development scheme and charitable organizations to the provincial Liberal Party. Several Liberal cabinet members were recipients of her largesse including Health Minister Elinor Caplan, Transportation Minister Ed Fulton and Revenue Minister Bernard Grandmaitre. These revelations led to a cabinet shuffle by Peterson in which five ministers who had received contributions lost their positions. On June 24, 1989, Peterson ordered a judicial inquiry be set up to investigate the matter. Initially Starr wanted to participate in the inquiry saying, &quot;I stand by all the things I participated in ... I think the inquiry will be a positive thing.&quot; Later on she moved to have the inquiry quashed. In January 1990, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed her request. Two weeks later the Supreme Court of Canada gave her leave to appeal. In a decision in April, the Supreme Court declared the inquiry unconstitutional. Starr successfully argued that an inquiry investigating criminal charges would deny subjects their full legal rights. Public inquiries can compel witnesses to testify but criminal trial defendants can refuse to testify. Starr was eventually sentenced to six months&#x27; jail time. Although no-one in Peterson&#x27;s administration was accused of criminal activity, the scandal eroded public confidence in the integrity of the government. Polls showed that more than half of respondents felt that Peterson had poorly handled the matter and 61% felt that it revealed widespread corruption in the government.

==== Fiscal policy ====

The Peterson administration also developed a reputation for fiscal prudence, under the management of Treasurer Robert Nixon. The Liberal government was able to introduce a balanced budget for 1989–1990 following several years of deficit spending in Ontario, at a time when deficit spending was commonplace in most of North America.

In the early 1990s recession, Ontario faced a weakening North American economy. Productivity levels were falling throughout the United States and Canada during this period. While there was little that Peterson, or any other Ontario Premier, could have done to prevent this downturn, it weakened his government&#x27;s reputation for fiscal competence. (Indeed, the government&#x27;s projected surplus budget for 1990–1991 ultimately yielded a deficit of at least three billion dollars.) Peterson &quot;was getting a ton of advice to call an early snap election after less than three years&quot; and &quot;pundits warned Peterson he certainly didn’t want to call an election in 1991, in the middle of a deep recession&quot;.

====Defeat in the 1990 provincial election====
Notwithstanding all of this, Peterson&#x27;s Liberal Party still retained a comfortable lead over the Progressive Conservatives and NDP in mid-1990 public opinion polls, as their party leaders Mike Harris and Bob Rae, respectively, were not expected to be strong challengers. The PC Party was broke after the 1987 election, and anticipating an early election call they held their leadership contest in May 1990 with a membership vote instead of a delegated convention, they still struggled due to newly minted leader Harris&#x27;s inexperience as well as an association with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s growing unpopularity. The NDP having never won an Ontario election and Official Opposition leader Bob Rae was considering retiring from the legislature after one more term. As a result, Peterson decided to call a snap election, less than three years into his mandate. This proved to be his greatest mistake.

During the first week of the campaign, then-attorney general Ian Scott, claimed that &#x27;while the voters might be cranky at the moment, they ultimately would hold their noses and re-elect the Liberals. After all, he added, “They’re not going to vote for Mike Harris, and what are they going to do — vote NDP?”&#x27; However many voters saw the early election as a mark of arrogance, and a sign that Peterson&#x27;s Liberals had become detached from the electorate. There was no defining issue behind the campaign, and many believed that Peterson was simply trying to win re-election before the economic downturn reached its worst phase. Some Liberal cabinet ministers, most notably Greg Sorbara and Jim Bradley, were strongly opposed to the early election call. Sean Conway, a member of Peterson&#x27;s inner circle, would later acknowledge that most backbench MPPs also opposed the timing of the campaign.

At the time the writ was dropped, the Liberals stood at 50% support in the polls. Peterson&#x27;s personal popularity rating based on his Meech Lake record was 54%. However, his luck turned immediately upon calling the election. One of the seminal moments in the campaign was at a press conference called to announce the forthcoming election. Peterson justified the early writ claiming &quot;especially after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, Ontario faced &#x27;profound changes in this country and the world&#x27; and that he needed to protect the province in the event of a national-unity crisis&quot;, while denying &quot;that he was being an opportunist and trying to capitalize on polling results that put Liberal support at 50 per cent&quot;. It was soon interrupted without intervention by security or police by Greenpeace activist Gord Perks, who arrived with a briefcase handcuffed to his arm, with a tape recorder inside playing a pre-recorded list of broken Liberal environmental promises. Peterson sat in front of the room full of reporters, awkwardly silent and clearly uncomfortable.

Peterson&#x27;s Liberal party, regarded as a challenger in 1985, was seen by the end of the 1980s as a &quot;juggernaut that became arrogant and didn’t listen to its critics&quot;. As the PC and NDP opposition parties were weakened after the 1987 election, it fell to the media and other special interest groups (particularly teachers’ unions and environmental groups) who were criticizing the Ontario government at a level not seen with past administrations. Disappointed by high expectations from Peterson&#x27;s 1987 massive electoral victory, as well as perceiving that the PC and NDP parties would not be strong opposition, groups representing various interests (such as teachers, doctors, and environmentalists), came out against Peterson on television, radio, in print, and at Liberal campaign events, despite the Liberals having worked cooperatively with these special interest groups prior to the election call. Protesters would follow the Premier throughout the campaign, and often received considerable media coverage. The media reported the election call as cynical, and the party appeared desperate when they unexpectedly proposed to cut the provincial sales tax halfway through the campaign. It did not help that the provincial election campaign was being run in the aftermath of the failed Meech Lake constitutional accord of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s federal government, with which Peterson had significant media exposure in association with the other first ministers.

Peterson felt that the Liberals’ fading poll numbers &quot;reflected greater anxieties about the world and that the party had failed to successfully communicate his government’s accomplishments&quot;; by contrast the NDP&#x27;s hastily assembled platform called &quot;Agenda for People&quot; managed to escape heavy scrutiny due to their underdog status. As the NDP gained momentum, the Liberals panicked as many candidates removed Peterson from their campaign materials and distanced themselves from Peterson, while Treasurer Robert Nixon proposed a cut to the sales tax. The Liberal campaign slogan shifted from “Effective leadership for a strong Ontario” to “Warning: An NDP government will be hazardous to your health.” &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; columnist Michael Bennett summed up the divergent fortunes of the Liberals and NDP as campaign progressed, writing “As Peterson became more strident, Rae assumed an almost statesman-like attitude. He’d used up most of the venom early in the campaign. Now he didn’t need it.”

On September 6, 1990, the NDP scored one of the greatest upsets in Canadian political history, taking 74 seats for a strong majority government. Due to the nature of the first-past-the-post system as well as numerous fringe parties contesting this election, one third of NDP seats were won with less than 40 per cent of the vote. While the NDP only outpolled the Liberals by a narrow six-point margin, they managed to unseat many Liberal incumbents in the Greater Toronto Area. The Liberal caucus was decimated as they plunged from 95 seats to 36, at the time their worst showing ever. The 59-seat loss surpassed the 48-seat loss in 1943 that began the Tories&#x27; long rule over the province. This was also the second-worst defeat for a governing party in Ontario. Peterson lost his own seat, having been resoundingly defeated by NDP candidate Marion Boyd in London Centre by over 8,200 votes. The loss ended Peterson&#x27;s political career. He announced his resignation as Liberal leader on the night of the election.

==Post-provincial politics==
Peterson has continued to organize and fund-raise for the federal and Ontario provincial Liberals. In May 2005, he played the central role in persuading Belinda Stronach, a federal Conservative MP, to cross the floor to the ruling Liberal Party, days before a crucial confidence motion on the federal budget of Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal minority government. The defection proved critical to the survival of Martin&#x27;s government, with the outcome of the budget vote 153–152 in favour of the government.

After Martin resigned the party leadership in the wake of the Liberal defeat in the 2006 election, Peterson planned to support former New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna who chose ultimately not to run. Peterson then backed Michael Ignatieff, criticizing former political opponent Bob Rae&#x27;s entry into the race due to the latter&#x27;s record as provincial premier. Peterson insisted he did not hold a personal grudge against Rae.

==Later career==

In 2003, Peterson was contracted by the federal government to be its chief negotiator in talks with the government of the Northwest Territories and aboriginal leaders to transfer federal powers over lands and resources.

Peterson served as Chancellor of the University of Toronto for two terms from July 1, 2006, until June 30, 2012.

In September 2013, Peterson was appointed chair of the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games Organizing Committee. In 2015, he was sued for alleged sexual harassment of a 34-year-old female Pan Am games manager Ximena Morris. Peterson denied any wrongdoing.

The case was dismissed with Morris apologising for the lawsuit but not the allegations.

David Peterson was the founding chairman of the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association, and was a member of Toronto&#x27;s Olympics Bid Committee. Since leaving politics, he has been a professor at York University in Toronto, a senior partner and chairman of the Toronto law firm Cassels, Brock &amp; Blackwell LLP and has been director or member of several charitable, cultural, and environmental organizations. He is or has been a member on several corporate boards, being particularly associated with Rogers Communications where he has been a director since 1991. In 2006, Peterson was named to the board of Shoppers Drug Mart at the time of the firm&#x27;s acquisition by Loblaws. In his legal practice he provides international advice to a wide range of clients about public policy issues and government affairs in Canada.

In 1999, Peterson was at the centre of controversy due to his membership on the board of YBM Magnex, a firm which was discovered to have links to the Russian mafia. Peterson maintained that he was unaware of illegal activities at the company, and referred to the accusations against him as &quot;guilt by association&quot;. A subsequent investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission found that Peterson&#x27;s actions met &quot;the legal test of due diligence&quot;, but expressed disappointment that he had not shown more leadership on the board.

A 2004 report from &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper noted that Peterson was chastened by this experience, and had become &quot;a cautious and more conscientious director&quot; since that time. The same article further claimed that he has &quot;no influence outside of Toronto&quot;.

On May 26, 2020, a group of Toronto investors known as NordStar Capital, announced a proposal to acquire TorStar Corporation the parent company of the &quot;Toronto Star,&quot; for C$52-million. Peterson was announced as part of the NordStar team. The bid was later improved to $60 million and was approved by courts and shareholders by early August 2020. Peterson took a senior advisory role at the Toronto Star as vice-chair of the Torstar board of directors and as of 2024 is chair of Torstar, the publisher of the Toronto Star.

<doc id="308230" wikidata="Q1345181" url="?curid=308230" title="List of best-selling singles in the United States">
<text>This list compiles the best-selling singles in the United States, based on reported sales figures. Some of the singles have been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In music, a single is a song considered commercially viable enough by the artist and record company to be released separately from an album, usually featured on an album as well. For more information, see single.

*The RIAA certifies a record only if that record company pays for its official certification; some companies do not consider this an important distinction and will not request certifications unless pressed by its active, still saleable artists. A full and complete list of RIAA-certified recordings would be a very incomplete list of popular American music.
*The RIAA only certifies a particular recording of a song. Remixes, live and other versions count as separate.
*Prior to 1989, physical singles were awarded with a Gold certification for shipments of 1,000,000 units and a Platinum certification for shipments of 2,000,000 units. For certification dates since January 1, 1989, a Gold award represented shipments of 500,000 units and a Platinum award represented shipments of 1,000,000 units.
*Since May 9, 2013, RIAA certifications for singles in the &quot;digital&quot; category include on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads. The current formula since February 1, 2016 is 150 on-demand streams = 1 song download.
*Physical sales figures backed by RIAA certifications may be inaccurate as physical singles can be &quot;overcertified&quot; (sell less copies than were shipped to stores) or &quot;undercertified&quot; (sell beyond their current certification level and not receive a new certification).

== Physical singles ==

All of these physical singles have sold over four million copies according to either reliable third-party claims or RIAA multi-platinum certifications.
== Digital singles ==

See also: a comprehensive list of the highest-certified singles at RIAA&#x27;s website. Manually adjust it to platinum awards filter, single format, and digital type.

The below singles have sold at least 6 million digital copies as reported by Luminate (or previously Nielsen SoundScan). Sales figures are not fully represented by RIAA certifications, which have included on-demand streaming-equivalent units since May 2013. Thus the actual sales figures will be different from the amounts specified by the RIAA.

<doc id="308234" wikidata="Q152087" url="?curid=308234" title="Humboldt University of Berlin">
<text>The Humboldt University of Berlin (, abbreviated HU Berlin) is a public research university in the central borough of Mitte in Berlin, Germany.

The university was established by Frederick William III on the initiative of Wilhelm von Humboldt, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher as the University of Berlin () in 1809, and opened in 1810. From 1828 until its closure in 1945, it was named the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin (). During the Cold War, the university found itself in East Berlin and was &quot;de facto&quot; split in two when the Free University of Berlin opened in West Berlin. The university received its current name in honour of Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt in 1949.

The university is divided into nine faculties including its medical school shared with the Freie Universität Berlin. The university has a student enrollment of around 35,000 students, and offers degree programs in some 171 disciplines from undergraduate to post-doctorate level. Its main campus is located on the boulevard in central Berlin. The university is known worldwide for pioneering the Humboldtian model of higher education, which has strongly influenced other European and Western universities.

It was generally regarded as the world&#x27;s preeminent university for the natural sciences during the 19th and early 20th century, as the university is linked to major breakthroughs in physics and other sciences by its professors, such as Albert Einstein. Past and present faculty and notable alumni include 57 Nobel Prize laureates (the most of any German university), as well as scholars and academics including Albert Einstein, Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Robert Koch, Theodor Mommsen, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Otto von Bismarck, W. E. B. Du Bois, Arthur Schopenhauer, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Walter Benjamin, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, Karl Liebknecht, Ernst Cassirer, Heinrich Heine, Eduard Fraenkel, Max Planck, Wernher von Braun and the Brothers Grimm.

==History==

===Main building===
The main building of Humboldt-Universität is the Prinz-Heinrich-Palais (English: &quot;Prince Henry&#x27;s Palace&quot;) on Unter den Linden boulevard in the historic centre of Berlin. It was erected from 1748 to 1753 for Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of Frederick the Great, according to plans by Johann Boumann in Baroque style. In 1809, the former Royal Prussian residence was converted into a university building. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, it was rebuilt from 1949 to 1962.

In 1967, eight statues from the destroyed Potsdam City Palace were placed on the side wings of the university building. Currently there is discussion about returning the statues to the Potsdam City Palace, which was rebuilt as the Landtag of Brandenburg in 2013.

===Early history===
Similar to the University of Bonn, the University of Berlin was established by King Friedrich Wilhelm III on 16 August 1809, during the period of the Prussian Reform Movement, on the initiative of the liberal Prussian philosopher and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt. The university was located in a palace constructed from 1748 to 1766 for the late Prince Henry, the younger brother of Frederick the Great. After his widow and her ninety-member staff moved out, the first unofficial lectures were given in the building in the winter of 1809. Humboldt faced great resistance to his ideas as he set up the university. He submitted his resignation to the King in April 1810, and was not present when the school opened that fall. 

The first students were admitted on 6 October 1810, and the first semester started on 10 October 1810, with 256 students and 52 lecturers in faculties of law, medicine, theology and philosophy under rector Theodor Schmalz. The university celebrates 15 October 1810 as the date of its opening. In 1810, at the time of the opening, the university established the first academic chair in the field of history in the world. From 1828 to 1945, the school was named the &quot;Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin&quot;, in honor of its founder. Ludwig Feuerbach, then one of the students, made a comment about the university in 1826: 
The university has been home to many of Germany&#x27;s greatest thinkers of the past two centuries, among them the subjective idealist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, the absolute idealist philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, the Romantic legal theorist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the anti-optimist philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, the objective idealist philosopher Friedrich Schelling, cultural critic Walter Benjamin, and famous physicists Albert Einstein and Max Planck.

The founders of Marxist theory Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels attended the university, as did poet Heinrich Heine, novelist Alfred Döblin, founder of structuralism Ferdinand de Saussure, German unifier Otto von Bismarck, Communist Party of Germany founder Karl Liebknecht, African American Pan Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois and European unifier Robert Schuman, as well as the influential surgeon Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach in the early half of the 1800s.

The structure of German research-intensive universities served as a model for institutions like Johns Hopkins University. Further, it has been claimed that &quot;the &#x27;Humboldtian&#x27; university became a model for the rest of Europe [...] with its central principle being the union of teaching and research in the work of the individual scholar or scientist.&quot;

===Enlargement===
In addition to the strong anchoring of traditional subjects, such as science, law, philosophy, history, theology and medicine, the university developed to encompass numerous new scientific disciplines. Alexander von Humboldt, brother of the founder William, promoted the new learning. The construction of modern research facilities in the second half of the 19th century aided the teaching of the natural sciences. Famous researchers, such as the chemist August Wilhelm Hofmann, the physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, the mathematicians Ernst Eduard Kummer, Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass, the physicians Johannes Peter Müller, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Albrecht von Graefe, Rudolf Virchow, and Robert Koch, contributed to Berlin University&#x27;s scientific fame.

During this period of enlargement, the university gradually expanded to incorporate other previously separate colleges in Berlin. An example would be the Charité, the Pépinière and the Collegium Medico-chirurgicum. In 1710, King Friedrich I had built a quarantine house for Plague at the city gates, which in 1727 was rechristened by the &quot;soldier king&quot; Friedrich Wilhelm: &quot;Es soll das Haus die Charité heißen&quot; (called Charité [French for &quot;charity&quot;]). By 1829 the site became Friedrich Wilhelm University&#x27;s medical campus and remained so until 1927 when the more modern University Hospital was constructed.

The university started a natural history collection in 1810, which by 1889, required a separate building and became the Museum für Naturkunde. The preexisting Tierarznei School, founded in 1790 and absorbed by the university, in 1934 formed the basis of the Veterinary Medicine Facility (Grundstock der Veterinärmedizinischen Fakultät). Also the Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule Berlin (Agricultural University of Berlin), founded in 1881 was affiliated with the Agricultural Faculties of the university.

In August 1870, in a speech delivered on the eve of war with France, Emil du Bois-Reymond proclaimed that &quot;the University of Berlin, quartered opposite the King&#x27;s palace, is, by the deed of our foundation, the intellectual bodyguard of the House of Hohenzollern (das geistige Leibregiment des Hauses Hohenzollern).&quot;

In 1887, chancellor Otto Bismarck established the (SOS), (usually known in English as the Oriental Seminary) to prepare public servants for posting to Kamerun (later Cameroon), then part of the German colonial empire. Various Asian languages were taught there, and in 1890, there were 115 students, which belonged to various faculties, including law; philosophy, medicine and physical sciences; and theology (as part of their training to be missionaries). Teachers included (1909–1915) and Heinrich Vieter. In the 1920s to 1930s, renowned Jewish orientalist Eugen Mittwoch was director of the school, before being forced to emigrate to London after Kristallnacht in 1938.

Friedrich Wilhelm University became an emulated model of a modern university in the 19th century.

===Third Reich===

After 1933, like all German universities, Friedrich Wilhelm University was impacted by the Nazi regime. The rector during this period was Eugen Fischer. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (German &quot;Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums&quot;) resulted in 250 Jewish professors and employees being fired from the university during 1933–1934, as well as numerous doctorates being withdrawn. Students and scholars, and other political opponents of Nazis, were ejected from the university and often deported. During this time nearly one third of all of the staff were fired by the Nazis.

It was from the university&#x27;s library that some 20,000 books by &quot;degenerates&quot; and opponents of the regime were taken to be burned on 10 May of that year in the &quot;Opernplatz&quot; square (now called the Bebelplatz) for a demonstration that was protected by the SA and featured a speech by Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. A monument to this tragic event called &quot;The Empty Library&quot; can now be found in the center of the square. It consists of a glass panel embedded in the pavement that looks into a large, subterranean white room with empty shelf space for 20,000 volumes, along with a plaque bearing an epigraph taken from an 1820 work by the great German-Jewish writer Heinrich Heine: 
===Cold War===
During the Cold War, the university was located in East Berlin. It reopened in 1946 as the University of Berlin, but faced repression from the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, including the persecution of liberal and social democrat students. Almost immediately, the Soviet occupiers started persecuting non-communists and suppressing academic freedom at the university, requiring lectures to be submitted for approval by Socialist Unity Party officials, and piped Soviet propaganda into the cafeteria. This led to strong protests within the student body and faculty. NKVD secret police arrested a number of students in March 1947 as a response. The Soviet Military Tribunal in Berlin-Lichtenberg ruled the students were involved in the formation of a &quot;resistance movement at the University of Berlin&quot;, as well as espionage, and were sentenced to 25 years of forced labor. 

From 1945 to 1948, 18 other students and teachers were arrested or abducted, many missing for weeks, and some were taken to the Soviet Union and executed. Many of the students targeted by Soviet persecution were active in the liberal or social democratic resistance against the Soviet-imposed communist dictatorship. The German communist party had long regarded the social democrats as their main enemies, dating back to the early days of the Weimar Republic. During the Berlin Blockade, the Freie Universität Berlin was established as a de facto western successor in West Berlin in 1948, with support from the United States, and retaining traditions and faculty members of the old Friedrich Wilhelm University. The name of the Free University refers to West Berlin&#x27;s perceived status as part of the Western &quot;free world&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;unfree&quot; Communist world in general and the &quot;unfree&quot; communist-controlled university in East Berlin in particular.

Because the historical name, the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, had monarchic origins, the school was officially renamed in 1949. Although the Soviet occupational authorities preferred to name the school after a communist leader, university leaders were able to name it the &quot;Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin&quot;, after the two Humboldt brothers, a name that was also uncontroversial in the West and capitalized on the fame of the Humboldt name, which is associated with the Humboldtian model of higher education.

===Modern Germany===
After the German reunification, the university was radically restructured under the Structure and Appointment Commissions, which were presided by West German professors. For departments on social sciences and humanities, the faculty was subjected to a &quot;liquidation&quot; process, in which contracts of employees were terminated and positions were made open to new academics, mainly West Germans. Older professors were offered early retirement. The East German higher education system included a much larger number of permanent assistant professors, lecturers and other middle level academic positions. After reunification, these positions were abolished or converted to temporary posts for consistency with the West German system. As a result, only 10% of the mid-level academics in Humboldt-Universität still had a position in 1998. Through the transformations, the university&#x27;s research and exchange links with Eastern European institutions were maintained and stabilized.

Today, Humboldt University is a state university with a large number of students (36,986 in 2014, among them more than 4,662 foreign students) after the model of West German universities, and like its counterpart the Freie Universität Berlin.

The university consists of three different campuses, namely Campus Mitte, Campus Nord and Campus Adlershof. Its main building is located in the centre of Berlin at the boulevard Unter den Linden and is the heart of Campus Mitte. The building was erected on order by King Frederick II for his younger brother Prince Henry of Prussia. All the institutes of humanities are located around the main building together with the Department of Law and the Department of Business and Economics. Campus Nord is located north of the main building close to Berlin Hauptbahnhof and is the home of the life science departments including the university medical center Charité. The natural sciences, together with computer science and mathematics, are located at Campus Adlershof in the south-east of Berlin. Furthermore, the university continues its tradition of a book sale at the university gates facing Bebelplatz.

==Organization==

=== Faculties and departments ===
The university is divided ino 9 faculties:
=== Graduate schools ===
Graduate schools provide structured PhD programmes:

* Berlin Graduate School of Ancient Studies
* Berlin Graduate School of Social Sciences
* Berlin-Brandenburg School for Regenerative Therapies
* Berlin School of Mind and Brain
* Berlin Mathematical School
* Graduate School of Ancient Philosophy
* Humboldt Graduate School
* SALSA - School of Analytical Sciences Adlershof
* Graduate School &quot;Advanced Materials&quot;

=== Central institutes ===
Furthermore, there are four central institutes (&quot;Zentralinstitute&quot;) that are part of the university:
* Centre for British Studies (in German: &quot;Großbritannienzentrum&quot;)
* Humboldt-Innovation (research transfer and spin-off service)
* &quot;Museum für Naturkunde&quot; (Natural History Museum)
* Späth-Arboretum
===Student parliament===
Each year, students elect the student parliament (), which serves as the body of student representatives under German law (&quot;AStA&quot;).
== Library ==
When the Royal Library proved insufficient, a new library was founded in 1831, first located in several temporary sites. In 1871–1874 a library building was constructed, following the design of architect Paul Emanuel Spieker. In 1910 the collection was relocated to the building of the Berlin State Library.

During the Weimar Period the library contained 831,934 volumes (1930) and was thus one of the leading university libraries in Germany at that time.

During the Nazi book burnings in 1933, no volumes from the university library were destroyed. The loss through World War II was comparatively small. In 2003, natural science-related books were outhoused to the newly founded library at the Adlershof campus, which is dedicated solely to the natural sciences.

Since the premises of the State Library had to be cleared in 2005, a new library building was erected close to the main building in the center of Berlin. The &quot;Jacob und Wilhelm Grimm-Zentrum&quot; (Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Centre, Grimm Zentrum, or GZ as referred to by students) opened in 2009.

In total, the university library contains about 6.5 million volumes and 9,000 held magazines and journals, and is one of the biggest university libraries in Germany.

The books of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft were destroyed during the Nazi book burnings, and the institute destroyed. Under the terms of the Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, the government had agreed to continue the work of the institute at the university after its founder&#x27;s death. However, these terms were ignored. In 2001, the university acquired the Archive for Sexology from the Robert Koch Institute, which was founded with a large private library donated by Erwin J. Haeberle. This has now been housed at the new Magnus Hirschfeld Center.
==Academics==
=== Rankings ===
According to the 2024 QS World University Rankings, the university ranked 120th globally and 7th at the national level. Additionally, in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2024, it was placed at 87th worldwide and 4th within the country. Because of an unresolved dispute over the counting of Nobel laureates before the Second World War – both Humboldt University and the Free University of Berlin claim to be the rightful successor of the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin – both do not appear in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) anymore since 2008.

In the 2023 QS Subject Ranking, Humboldt University ranks first in Germany in the arts and humanities and the social sciences. In the 2024 THE Subject Ranking, Humboldt University ranks second in Germany in the arts and humanities, law, psychology, and social sciences. In the 2023 ARWU Subject Ranking, Humboldt University ranks first in Germany in geography.



Measured by the number of top managers in the German economy, Humboldt-Universität ranked 53rd in 2019. In 2020, the American &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; listed Humboldt-Universität as the 82nd best in the world, climbing eight positions, being among the 100 best in the world in 17 areas out of 29 ranked.

=== International partnerships ===
HU students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as the University of Warwick, Princeton University, and the University of Vienna.

<text>Music recording certification is a system of certifying that a music recording has shipped, sold, or streamed a certain number of units. The threshold quantity varies by type (such as album, single, music video) and by nation or territory (see List of music recording certifications).

Almost all countries follow variations of the RIAA certification categories, which are named after precious materials (gold, platinum and diamond).

The threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released. Typically, they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold. Different sales levels, some perhaps 10 times greater than others, may exist for different music media (for example: videos versus albums, singles, or music download).

== History ==
The original gold and silver record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize their sales achievements. The first silver disc was awarded by Regal Zonophone to George Formby in December 1937 for sales of 100,000 copies of &quot;The Window Cleaner&quot;.

The first literal gold record award was presented to Glenn Miller and His Orchestra by RCA Victor (for subsidiary label Bluebird Records) on February 10, 1942, celebrating the sale of 1.2 million copies of the single, &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;.

Further examples of company awards are the gold records awarded in 1956 by RCA Victor to Harry Belafonte for his album &quot;Calypso&quot; for being the first LP record album to sell more than one million copies and Elvis Presley for one million units sold of his RCA Victor single &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. Also in 1956, Decca&#x27;s presented a gold record award to Jerry Lewis for the single &quot;Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody&quot;.

At the industry level, in 1958 the Recording Industry Association of America introduced its gold record award program for records of any kind, albums or singles, which achieved one million dollars in retail sales. These sales were restricted to U.S.-based record companies and did not include exports to other countries. For albums in 1968, this would mean shipping approximately 670,000 units; for singles the number would be 1,000,000.

In 1976, the RIAA introduced the platinum certification for the sale of one million units for albums and two million for singles, with the gold certification redefined for sales of 500,000 units for albums and one million for singles. No album was certified platinum prior to this year. The 1958 RCA Victor recording by Van Cliburn of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto would eventually be awarded a platinum citation, but this did not occur until two decades after its release. In 1999, the diamond certification was introduced for sales of ten million units. In the late 1980s, the certification thresholds for singles were dropped to match that of albums.

=== RIAA certification ===

The first official designation of a &quot;gold record&quot; by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was established for singles in 1958, and the RIAA also trademarked the term &quot;gold record&quot; in the United States. On 14 March 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, Perry Como&#x27;s hit single &quot;Catch a Falling Star&quot;. The &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to the Eagles compilation album &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; on 24 February 1976, and to Johnnie Taylor&#x27;s single &quot;Disco Lady&quot; on 22 April 1976. As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.

In the 20th century, and for a part of the first decade of the 21st, it was common for distributors to claim certifications based on their shipments – wholesale to retail outlets – which led to many certifications which outstripped the actual final retail sales figures. This became much less common once the majority of retail sales became paid digital downloads and digital streaming.

=== Digital media certification ===
In most countries, certifications no longer apply solely to physical media but now also include sales awards recognizing digital downloads (in the US and UK since 2004). In June 2006, the RIAA also certified the ringtone downloads of songs. Streaming from on-demand services such as Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and Napster has been included into existing digital certification in the US since 2013, and the UK and Germany since 2014. In the US and Germany, video streaming services like YouTube, VEVO, and Yahoo! Music also began to be counted towards the certification, in both cases using the formula of 100 streams being equivalent to one download. Other countries, such as Denmark and Spain, maintain separate awards for digital download singles and streaming.

===Symbolic certifications===
Other recording artists have received special and symbolic recognitions, including Raphael with a &quot;Uranium disc&quot; granted by Hispavox and SGAE in 1980, Luis Miguel received in 1999 a &quot;Lapislazuli disc&quot; for his sales of over 1.7 million in Chile, and Luis Fonsi received the &quot;Plutonium disc&quot; from Universal Music Group recognizing the global sales of &quot;Despacito&quot; in 2017.

=== IFPI certification ===
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) was founded in 1933, and since 1996, has granted the Platinum Europe Award for album sales over one million within Europe and (as of October 2009) the Middle East. Multi-platinum Europe Awards are presented for sales in subsequent multiples of one million. Eligibility is unaffected by time (from date of release), and is not restricted to European-based artists.

=== IMPALA certification ===
The Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA) was founded in April 2000 to grow the independent music sector and promote independent music in the interests of artistic, entrepreneurial and cultural diversity. IMPALA launched sales awards in 2005 as the first sales awards recognising that success on a pan-European basis begins well before sales reach one million. 

The award levels are Silver (20,000+), Double Silver (40,000+), Gold (75,000+), Double Gold (150,000+), Diamond (200,000+), Platinum (400,000+) and Double Platinum (800,000+).

== Certification thresholds ==


Below are certification thresholds for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and France. The numbers in the tables are in terms of &quot;units&quot;, where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for one release to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes Platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Multi-Platinum&quot;. Since 2013 in the U.S., and 2014 in the UK and Germany, streaming of songs counts towards certification of singles with 150 streams being the equivalent of 1 unit sold. Since February 2016, RIAA includes on-demand audio and video streams and a track sale equivalent in Gold and Platinum Album Award. The program counts both sales and streams for single and album certifications.

== Manufacture of awards ==

The plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been vacuum metallized and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal &quot;masters&quot;, &quot;mothers&quot;, or &quot;stampers&quot; (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The music in the grooves on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded.

Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between US$135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.

<text>John Jackson Sparkman (December 20, 1899 – November 16, 1985) was an American jurist and politician from the state of Alabama. A Southern Democrat, Sparkman served in the United States House of Representatives from 1937 to 1946 and the United States Senate from 1946 until 1979. He was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president in the 1952 presidential election.

Born in Morgan County, Alabama, Sparkman established a legal practice in Huntsville, Alabama, after graduating from the University of Alabama School of Law. He won election to the House in 1936 and served as house majority whip in 1946. He left the House in 1946 after winning a special election to succeed Senator John H. Bankhead II. While in the Senate, he helped establish Marshall Space Flight Center and served as the chairman of several committees. Sparkman served as Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s running mate in the 1952 presidential election, but they were defeated by the Republican ticket of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon.

Known as a defender of segregation during the Civil Rights era, Sparkman voted regularly against civil rights legislation and condemned the &quot;judicial usurpation&quot; of the U.S. Supreme Court decision of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, Sparkman signed the 1956 Southern Manifesto, which pledged opposition to racial integration and promised to use &quot;all lawful means&quot; to fight the ruling that put court power behind the integration of public institutions. He became the longest-serving senator from Alabama in 1977, a record that was surpassed by Richard Shelby in 2019. Sparkman chose not to seek re-election in 1978 and retired from public office the following year.

==Early life and education==
Sparkman, a son of Whitten Joseph and Julia Mitchell (Kent) Sparkman, was born on a farm near Hartselle, in Morgan County, Alabama. He grew up in a four-room cabin with his eleven brothers and sisters. His father was a tenant farmer and doubled as the county&#x27;s deputy sheriff. As a child, Sparkman worked on his father&#x27;s farm picking cotton. He was raised Methodist.

He attended a one-room elementary school in rural Morgan County, then walked every day to his high school. Sparkman graduated from Morgan County High School in 1917 and enrolled in the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. During World War I he was a member of the Students Army Training Corps. Sparkman worked shoveling coal in the university&#x27;s boiler room to help pay for his education. He worked on &quot;The Crimson White&quot; (the university&#x27;s newspaper), becoming the paper&#x27;s editor-in-chief, and served as his class&#x27;s student-body president. Sparkman was awarded a teaching fellowship in history and political science, he became a founding member of the Gamma Alpha chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha in 1921, and was chosen as the university&#x27;s &quot;most outstanding senior&quot; the same year. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1921, and his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1923. In 1924, Sparkman earned his master&#x27;s degree in history; his master thesis, on former Confederate colonel William C. Oates&#x27;s 1894 campaign for Governor of Alabama, was titled &quot;The Kolb-Oates Campaign of 1894&quot;.

==Legal career==

Sparkman briefly worked as a high school teacher before he was admitted to the Alabama State Bar in 1925. He commenced his practice in Huntsville. He was also an instructor at Huntsville College from 1925 to 1928. He was appointed as a U.S. Commissioner (magistrate judge) for Alabama&#x27;s northern judicial district, serving from 1930 to 1931.

Sparkman was involved in many civic organizations, including serving as the district governor of the Kiwanis Club of Huntsville in 1930, and later as the president of the Huntsville Chamber of Commerce. A Freemason, he was life member of Helion Lodge#1 in Huntsville. He was also member of the Huntsville Scottish Rite bodies and a recipient of the Knight Commander Court of Honor (KCCH).

==Political career==
After Representative Archibald Hill Carmichael announced his retirement in 1936, Sparkman ran in the Democratic primary for the open seat. A teacher of the Big Brother Class at the First Methodist Church in Huntsville, his campaign was launched through fundraising, campaigning and advertising by students in his Sunday class. Sparkman was elected to the United States House of Representatives in the 1936 election, defeating Union Party candidate, architect Harry J. Frahn with 99.7% of the vote. He was reelected in 1938 and 1940. During this time, World War II began in Europe. Sparkman took a pro-British foreign policy stance, advocating the United States should assist Great Britain in the war against the Nazis. In 1941, he voted in favor of the Lend-Lease Act of 1941 in order to provide military equipment and food to the United Kingdom. Sparkman was reelected in the elections of 1942 and 1944, serving in the 75th, 76th, 77th, 78th, and 79th Congresses.

According to his citation from the Alabama Academy of Honor , into which Sparkman was inducted in 1969, as a Member of the House of Representatives, &quot;[Sparkman] gained renown for his sponsorship of such programs as the farm-tenant purchase program, rehabilitation loans for small farmers, and lower interest rates for farm loans. He was a champion of the TVA and REA.&quot;

In 1946, he served as house majority whip. He was reelected in the 1946 House election to the 80th Congress and on the same date was elected to the United States Senate in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John H. Bankhead II, for the term ending on January 3, 1949. Sparkman resigned from the House of Representatives immediately following the election and began his Senate term on November 6, 1946. He served until his retirement on January 3, 1979, having not sought reelection in 1978.

He was chairman of the Select Committee on Small Business (81st, 82nd, and 84th through 90th Congresses), co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Inaugural Arrangements (86th Congress), chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency (90th and 91st Congresses), co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Defense Production (91st and 93rd Congresses), Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (92nd and 93rd Congresses), and a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations (94th and 95th Congress).

The 1943 &quot;Sparkman Act&quot;, which allowed female physicians to be commissioned as officers in the armed forces, was named after him.

In 1949, Sparkman was instrumental in convincing the United States Department of the Army to transfer the missile development activities from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Redstone Arsenal. This brought Wernher von Braun and the German Operation Paperclip scientists and engineers to Huntsville, forming the foundation to what eventually became the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. Von Braun selected Huntsville to relocate his fellow German engineers because it reminded him of Germany.

Sparkman was a representative of the United States at the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations in 1950.

In January 1951, Sparkman stated that he believed the Truman administration housing defense program could increase inflationary pressures, a view that aligned with Republican senators Irving Ives and Andrew Frank Schoeppel, but furthered that the plan was essential and should be undertaken regardless of inflation concerns. On September 8, 1951, he was the fourth signatory to the Treaty of Peace with Japan (with two declarations).

In 1952, he was the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president, running on the ticket of Adlai Stevenson. However, the election was won by the Republican candidate, Dwight D. Eisenhower. Sparkman ran against Richard M. Nixon, the junior senator from California.

After the election, Sparkman in an interview expressed approval that American small businessmen were giving large firms competition for foreign aid contracts. &quot;The large firms once dominated this field. Now we are insisting that the small business get a fair share of these contracts and it has had a good effect. The increasing competition has cut costs in the entire American foreign aid program.&quot;

In January 1955, the University of Alabama News Bureau released remarks of Sparkman he had made during an interview following the 1954 midterm elections. Sparkman predicted a larger number of Democrats would cooperate with the Eisenhower administration, furthering that their tendency to criticize the Republicans rather than the president directly was ending, and Republicans, by contrast, would be more likely to oppose the president&#x27;s foreign policy. Sparkman advocated for studying of the administration&#x27;s defense program to confirm that the reduction in numbers would not be concurrent with a decrease in strength.

On January 21, 1955, Sparkman introduced a bill authorizing $50 million in appropriation each quarter of the year for G.I.s to see a reduction dependent on the sales of home mortgages to private lenders of properties owned by the Veterans Administration. In a statement, Sparkman argued that the past few years had seen a home loan program which had come up short in meeting the needs of GI applications and the government was making a profit from the loans to GI&#x27;s.

On February 2, 1955, during an interview, Sparkman said the US would have to weigh giving Nationalist islands to Red China if the United Nations succeeded in imposing a cease-fire in Formosa. He said the Eisenhower administration had a foggy attitude towards defending the islands.

In February 1955, Sparkman criticized the farming policies of the Eisenhower administration, charging them with having hurt the financial situations of American farmers the most since before the beginning of World War II and that the plight of farmers would continue so long as legislation affecting controls on crop acreage and the flexible price support system was enacted.

Sparkman delivered a speech at the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Rome, Georgia on February 21, 1955, assailing Republican economic promises as a hoax and asserting the Eisenhower administration was operating on a theory of reactionary trickle-down economics. He said the school and road programs of the Eisenhower administration were intended to deliver larger funds to investment bankers rather than children or those using highways, predicting that the enactment of Eisenhower&#x27;s school program would not see a single classroom built in either Georgia or Alabama.

On February 25, 1955, Sparkman predicted the Senate would approve the authorization of one and a half billion dollars of government insurance to be granted for housing mortgages, saying that if the bill was not enacted, &quot;our housing program will come to a stop.&quot;

In 1956, Sparkman was one of 82 representatives and 19 senators who signed the Southern Manifesto opposing the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; and racial integration. In 1956, the Democrats did not renominate Sparkman as Stevenson&#x27;s vice presidential running mate, opting instead for U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of neighboring Tennessee, partly because he had refused to sign. In 1957, Sparkman voted against HR 6127, the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

On June 30, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed the Housing Act of 1961; Kennedy thanked Sparkman for spearheading &quot;this bill through the Senate&quot;. During the September 4, 1964 signing of the Housing Act of 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, the latter expressed his &quot;very special congratulations this morning to both Senator Sparkman and Congressman Rains of Alabama.&quot;

In August 1961, the Kennedy administration reaffirmed its lack of interest in compromising on its five-year foreign aid program, Sparkman arguing that the administration faced the possibility of having to settle for a reduction in the program by two years.

On June 19, 1964, Sparkman and 20 other Southern Democrats, and one lone Southern Republican voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

On July 9, 1964, President Johnson signed the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 into law, observing Sparkman was one of the members of Congress who helped in securing the legislation&#x27;s passage.

From 1967 to 1975, Sparkman was the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency where he worked on helping small farmers.

After this, J. William Fulbright, the longest serving chairman as of 2023 from 1959 to 1974, lost the Democratic primary contest in Arkansas in the 1974 United States Senate election in Arkansas, who Sparkman succeeded to become the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee from 1975 to 1979. On the Foreign Relations Committee, the committee lost much of its influence due to a perceived lack of leadership and his ideological position that the president should mainly pursue foreign policy, not Congress. This statement was reinforced by a response to an interviewee&#x27;s question shortly after becoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, where he said that they don&#x27;t &quot;make foreign policy, except insofar as the executive will take our advice and consent.&quot;

On January 20, 1978, at the age of 78, Sparkman announced that—for reasons he did not specify—he would not seek reelection as Alabama senator, but noted that he had served as Alabama senator for longer than anybody in history up to that point.

===Later elections===
In 1960, Sparkman defeated the Republican Julian E. Elgin of Montgomery, who received 164,868 votes (29.8 percent) in the Senate contest. Six years later, Elgin ran again against Sparkman as an Independent but polled few votes. In 1966, Sparkman defeated another Republican, John Grenier, the former state GOP chairman and an attorney from Birmingham, who polled 39 percent of the vote.

Initially, Grenier had planned to run for governor in 1966, and James D. Martin was poised to oppose Sparkman, as Martin had four years earlier against Sparkman&#x27;s colleague, J. Lister Hill. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted toppling the &quot;tight one-party oligarchy&quot; would be a herculean task. Though Sparkman trailed in some polls, &quot;The Times&quot; speculated that he would rebound because Alabamians were accustomed to voting straight Democratic tickets.

In his last Senate race in 1972, Sparkman easily defeated President Nixon&#x27;s former postmaster general, the Republican businessman Winton M. Blount of Montgomery, originally from Union Springs. Blount, running without a specific endorsement from President Nixon, first had to dispatch intraparty Republican rivals Martin and Alabama State Representative Bert Nettles.

On October 30, 1977, Sparkman became the longest-serving senator in the history of Alabama. This record was later surpassed by Richard Shelby in 2019.

==Death==
On November 16, 1985, Sparkman died of a heart attack at Big Springs Manor Nursing Home in Huntsville, Alabama, a month before his 86th birthday. Survived by his wife and daughter, he was interred in Huntsville at the historic Maple Hill Cemetery.

Sparkman High School in Harvest, Alabama, Sparkman Park in Hartselle, Alabama, Sparkman School in Somerville, Alabama, Sparkman Drive in Huntsville are all named in his honor.

<text>John William Bricker (September 6, 1893March 22, 1986) was an American politician and attorney who served as a United States senator and the 54th governor of Ohio. He was also the Republican nominee for Vice President in 1944.

Born in Madison County, Ohio, Bricker attended Ohio State University and began a legal practice in Columbus, Ohio. He also served in the United States Army during World War I. He held various public offices between 1920 and 1937, including the position of Ohio Attorney General. Bricker served three terms as Governor of Ohio from 1939 to 1945. Bricker was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1944. He was Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s running mate on the Republican ticket in the 1944 election, campaigning against the New Deal and President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s judicial nominees. The Republican ticket was defeated by the Democratic ticket of Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.

Bricker won election to the Senate in 1946. He introduced the Bricker Amendment, which would have limited the president&#x27;s power to make treaties. Though the Bricker Amendment received support from some members of both parties, it was not passed by Congress. Bricker won re-election in 1952 but was narrowly defeated by Stephen M. Young in 1958. After leaving office, Bricker resumed the practice of law and died in 1986.

==Early life and education==
Bricker was born on a farm near Mount Sterling in Madison County in south central Ohio. He was the son of Laura (née King) and Lemuel Spencer Bricker. He attended Ohio State University at Columbus, where he divided his time between the debating team, the varsity baseball team, and the Delta Chi fraternity. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts from Ohio State in 1916 and from its law school in 1920, he was admitted to the bar in 1917 and began his legal practice in Columbus in 1920.

==Public service==
During World War I, Bricker served as first lieutenant and chaplain in the United States Army in 1917 and 1918. He was subsequently the solicitor for Grandview Heights, Ohio, from 1920 to 1928, assistant Attorney General of Ohio from 1923 to 1927, a member of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio from 1929 to 1932, and Attorney General of Ohio from 1933 to 1937.

He was elected governor for three two-year terms, serving from 1939 to 1945, each time winning with a greater margin of victory. Bricker espoused a stance against centralized government, preferring to increase involvement in state and local governments, and made this known in his inaugural address as Governor:

Bricker was the 1944 Republican nominee for vice president, running with presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York who was nine years Bricker&#x27;s junior. The Republicans lost handily to the Democratic ticket of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. In that campaign, Bricker proved to be a tireless campaigner, visiting thirty-one states and making 173 speeches, including 28 over a six-day period. His final remarks came on radio on election eve from the governor&#x27;s office in Columbus, when he declared: &quot;Not only has the New Deal depleted our resources, recklessly spent our money, but it has undermined the very spiritual foundations of our government.&quot; Though most of his campaigning was in New England, the Midwest, and the West, Bricker even visited the then-historically and -heavily Democratic state of Texas, where in Dallas, he called Franklin Roosevelt &quot;a front for the Hillman-Browder Communist Party,&quot; referring to the respective leaders of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the Communist Party of the United States of America.

In 1946, Bricker was elected to the United States Senate. He was re-elected in 1952, serving from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1959.

Governor Dewey was the Republican presidential nominee again in 1948, but Senator Bricker was not his running mate. Dewey chose instead Governor Earl Warren of California in the hope that the 1948 ticket would carry California, which the Dewey-Bricker ticket had failed to do. The Dewey-Warren ticket also lost California, and the absence of Bricker on the second ticket may have been a factor in Dewey&#x27;s failure to win Bricker&#x27;s home state of Ohio again. Bricker campaigned with Warren in 1944 in Sacramento, where Bricker attacked the politics of war-time rationing; then in San Francisco Bricker charged that Roosevelt had packed the U.S. judiciary with liberal jurists hostile to the Constitution. However, even if Dewey had carried both California and Ohio in 1948, the two large states would have been insufficient to elect him president in that second campaign.

Bricker&#x27;s Senate service is best remembered for his attempts to amend the United States Constitution to limit the President&#x27;s treaty-making powers (the Bricker Amendment). He was the chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce during the 83rd Congress.

On July 12, 1947, a former Capitol police officer, William Louis Kaiser, fired shots at Senator Bricker as he boarded the underground subway from the Senate office building to the Capitol. The two shots, fired at close range, narrowly missed their target. Kaiser stated he was &quot;trying to refresh&quot; Bricker&#x27;s memory. Kaiser had served on the police force as a protege of Bricker&#x27;s predecessor in the Senate and had complained of losing substantial money on Columbus real estate. An investigation concluded that Kaiser may have fired blanks or else purposely missed Bricker.

Bricker voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. In 1958, Stephen M. Young ran for the Senate against the incumbent Bricker. Bricker seemed invincible, but Young capitalized on widespread public opposition to the proposed &quot;right to work&quot; amendment to Ohio&#x27;s constitution, which Bricker had endorsed. Few thought that Young, 70 at the time, could win; even members of his own party had doubts, particularly Ohio&#x27;s other senator, Democrat Frank J. Lausche. In an upset amid a national Democratic trend, Young defeated Bricker by 52 to 48 percent. Bricker then retired from public life.

==Professional life and death==

In 1945, Bricker founded the Columbus law firm now known as Bricker &amp; Eckler. The firm now has additional offices in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Marietta, Barnesville, and Lebanon. It is now one of the ten largest firms in the state of Ohio. The firm has maintained an office and conference room in Bricker&#x27;s honor in its Columbus office featuring memorabilia from Bricker&#x27;s political career.

He was married to the former Harriet Day.

After leaving the Senate, John Bricker resumed the practice of law. He died in Columbus on March 22, 1986, at the age of 92 and is interred at Green Lawn Cemetery.

<text>Chesney Henry &quot;Chet&quot; Baker Jr. (December 23, 1929 – May 13, 1988) was an American jazz trumpeter and vocalist. He is known for major innovations in cool jazz that led him to be nicknamed the &quot;Prince of Cool&quot;.

Baker earned much attention and critical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals: &quot;Chet Baker Sings&quot; (1954) and &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot; (1958). Jazz historian Dave Gelly described the promise of Baker&#x27;s early career as &quot;James Dean, Sinatra, and Bix, rolled into one&quot;. His well-publicized drug habit also drove his notoriety and fame. Baker was in and out of jail frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and 1980s.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Baker was born December 23, 1929, in Yale, Oklahoma, and raised in a musical household. His father, Chesney Baker Sr., was a professional Western swing guitarist, and his mother, Vera Moser, was a pianist who worked in a perfume factory. His maternal grandmother was Norwegian. Baker said that owing to the Great Depression, his father, though talented, had to quit as a musician and take a regular job. In 1940, when Baker was 10, his family relocated to Glendale, California.

Baker began his musical career singing in a church choir. His father, a fan of Jack Teagarden, gave him a trombone, before switching to the trumpet at the age of 13 when the trombone proved to be too large for him. His mother said that he had begun to memorize tunes on the radio before he was given an instrument. After &quot;falling in love&quot; with the trumpet, he improved noticeably in two weeks. Peers called Baker a natural musician to whom playing came effortlessly.

Baker received some musical education at Glendale High School, but he left school at the age of 16 in 1946 to join the United States Army. He was assigned to Berlin, Germany, where he joined the 298th Army Band. While stationed in Berlin, he became acquainted with modern jazz by listening to V-Discs of Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Kenton. After leaving the Army in 1948, he studied music theory and harmony at El Camino College in Los Angeles. He dropped out during his second year to re-enlist. He became a member of the Sixth Army Band at the Presidio in San Francisco, spending time in clubs such as Bop City and the Black Hawk. He was discharged from the Army in 1951 and proceeded to pursue a career in music.

===Career===

Baker performed with Vido Musso and Stan Getz before being chosen by Charlie Parker for a series of West Coast engagements.

In 1952, Baker joined the Gerry Mulligan Quartet and attracted considerable attention. Rather than playing identical melody lines in unison like Parker and Gillespie, Baker and Mulligan complemented each other with counterpoint and anticipating what the other would play next. &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; with a solo by Baker, became a hit and was associated with Baker for the rest of his career. With the quartet, Baker was a regular performer at Los Angeles jazz clubs such as The Haig and the Tiffany Club.

Baker formed a quartet with a rotation that included pianist Russ Freeman, bassists Bob Whitlock, Carson Smith, Joe Mondragon, and Jimmy Bond, and drummers Larry Bunker, Bob Neel, and Shelly Manne.

Baker&#x27;s quartet released popular albums between 1953 and 1956. Baker won reader&#x27;s polls at &quot;Metronome&quot; and &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazines, beating trumpeters Miles Davis and Clifford Brown. In 1954, readers named Baker the top jazz vocalist. In 1954, Pacific Jazz Records released &quot;Chet Baker Sings&quot;, an album that both increased his visibility and drew criticism. Nevertheless, Baker continued to sing throughout the rest of his career.

Baker, with his youthful, chiseled looks oft-photographed by William Claxton, and his cool demeanor that evoked breezy California playboy living, became somewhat of a teen idol on top of being a respected, up-and-coming jazz musician. Hollywood studios saw movie star potential in Baker, and he made his acting debut in the film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Horizon&quot; in the fall of 1955. Baker declined a studio contract, preferring life on the road as a musician.

Over the next few years, he led his own combos, including a 1955 quintet with Francy Boland where Baker combined trumpet-playing and singing. In September 1955, he left for Europe for the first time, completing an eight-month tour and recording for the Barclay label that October. Some of these sessions were released in the United States as &quot;Chet Baker in Europe.&quot; While there, he also recorded a rare accompaniment for another vocalist: Caterina Valente playing guitar and singing &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot; and &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot;.

One month into the tour, pianist Dick Twardzik died of a heroin overdose. Despite this, Baker continued the tour, employing local pianists.

Returning to Los Angeles post-tour, Baker returned to recording for Pacific Jazz. His output included three collaborations with Art Pepper, including &quot;Playboys&quot;, and the soundtrack to &quot;The James Dean Story&quot;. Baker moved to New York City, where he collaborated again with Gerry Mulligan for the 1957 release &quot;Reunion with Chet Baker&quot;. In 1958, Baker rejoined with Stan Getz for &quot;Stan Meets Chet&quot;. That same year, he also released &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;, similar to &quot;Chet Baker Sings&quot;, notable for featuring his scat singing skills in lieu of trumpet-playing. His last significant release before returning to Europe was &quot;Chet&quot;, released by Riverside Records, featuring an all-star personnel that included pianist Bill Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Philly Joe Jones, all associated with leading jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.

===Drug addiction and decline===
Soon after signing on with Riverside Records, Baker was arrested twice; the first arrest involved a stay at a Lexington hospital, then imprisonment at Rikers Island for four months on drug charges. Baker said he began using heroin in 1957. However, author Jeroen de Valk and pianist Russ Freeman said that Baker started heroin in the early 1950s. Freeman was Baker&#x27;s musical director after Baker left the Mulligan quartet. Sometimes Baker pawned his instruments to buy drugs.

In late 1959, Baker returned to Europe, recording in Italy what became known as the Milano sessions with arranger and conductor Ezio Leoni (Len Mercer) and his orchestra. Baker appeared as himself in the musicarello film, &quot;Howlers in the Dock&quot;. Tabloids reviled Baker for his drug habit and reckless womanizing and infidelity. In August 1960, he was imprisoned in Lucca for importing narcotics, forging prescriptions, and drug abuse. This forced Leoni to communicate through the prison warden to coordinate arrangements with Baker as they prepared for recording.

Baker spent nearly a year and a half in jail, and was later arrested in West Germany and expelled to Switzerland, then France, later moving to England in August 1962. He appeared as himself in the film &quot;Stolen Hours&quot;, which was released in 1963. He was deported from England to France, because of a drug offense, in March 1963. He lived in Paris and performed there and in Spain over the next year, but after being arrested again, he was deported to the U.S. from Germany. He settled in Milpitas, California, performing in San Francisco and San Jose between jail terms for prescription fraud.

Baker&#x27;s first release in 1962, after his Italian prison sentence, was &quot;Chet Is Back!&quot; for RCA, balancing ballads with energetic bop. That same year, Baker collaborated with Ennio Morricone in Rome for a series of orchestral pop records, recording four original songs that he had composed during his prison sentence: &quot;Chetty&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, &quot;So che ti perderò&quot;, &quot;Motivo su raggio di luna&quot;, and &quot;Il mio domani&quot;.

Baker returned to New York City in 1964. Throughout most of the 1960s, Baker played flugelhorn, and recorded music that could be classified as West Coast jazz. In 1964, he released &quot;The Most Important Jazz Album of 1964/65&quot; on Colpix Records, and in 1965 he released &quot;Baby Breeze&quot; on Limelight. He then released five albums with Prestige, recorded in one week.

Baker fell behind on jazz&#x27;s latest innovations. At the end of 1965, he returned to the Pacific label, recording six themed albums whose content veered from straight jazz towards uninspired, instrumental covers of contemporary pop songs arranged by Bud Shank. Baker himself was unhappy with the records, describing them as &quot;simply a job to pay the rent.&quot; By this time, he had a wife and three children to support.

The following summer, already having reached a low point in his career, Baker was beaten up, probably while attempting to buy drugs, after performing at The Trident in Sausalito. In the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;, Baker said an acquaintance attempted to rob him, but backed off, only to return the next night with a group of men who chased him. He entered a car and was surrounded. Instead of rescuing him, the people inside the car pushed him back out onto the street, where the chase continued. He received cuts and several of his teeth were knocked out. This incident has been often misdated or otherwise said to be exaggerated partly because of his own unreliable testimony on the matter.

Regardless, the 1966 incident did lead to his teeth eventually deteriorating. By late 1968 or early 1969, he needed dentures. This ruined his embouchure, and he struggled to relearn how to play the trumpet and flugelhorn.

Baker claims that, for three years, he worked at a gas station until concluding that he had to find a way back to music and retrain his embouchure. Biographer Jeroen de Valk notes that Baker was still musically active after 1966, performing and occasionally recording. In April 1968, he provided flugelhorn for Bud Shank&#x27;s &quot;Magical Mystery&quot; album. In 1969, he released &quot;Albert&#x27;s House&quot;, which features 11 compositions by Steve Allen, who organized the recording date to help Baker restart his career. In 1970, Baker released &quot;Blood, Chet and Tears&quot;.

After these unsuccessful releases, Baker withdrew from the music business. He did not release another album for 4 years, and from around 1968 to 1973, stopped performing in public. Moving back with his family to his mother&#x27;s house in San Jose and depending on welfare, Baker was arrested for forging heroin prescriptions. The judge released him on the condition that he remained on methadone for the next seven years.

===Comeback===
In 1973, Baker decided to attempt a comeback. Returning to the straight-ahead jazz that began his career, he drove to New York to perform again. In 1974, the India Navigation label released a live album of performances with saxophonist Lee Konitz. &quot;She Was Too Good to Me&quot;, released by CTI Records that same year, is considered a comeback album. His last release of 1974 was another live album recorded at Carnegie Hall, which was his final collaboration with Gerry Mulligan.

From that time, work in both the U.S. and Europe was inconsistent. In 1977, Baker recorded &quot;Once Upon a Summertime&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;. That November, he returned to Europe to tour for the rest of that year. Being met with renewed interest in France, Italy, Germany, and Denmark, Baker decided to stay. He worked almost exclusively in Europe, only returning to the U.S. about once a year to attend some performances.

From that point on, Baker recorded a prolific amount of material. In 1979, Baker made 11 records; the following year, he made 10. They were released by small jazz labels such as Circle, SteepleChase, and Sandra.

During the early 1980s, Baker began to associate himself with musicians with whom he meshed well, such as guitarist Philip Catherine, bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, and pianist Michel Graillier.

Later in his career, Baker preferred to play in ensembles without drums. He detested playing at loud venues to inattentive audiences. At gigs in lively French and American clubs, he would sometimes wait for over half an hour for noise to die down before beginning to perform, and he would pause his performance if the audience made a racket.

In 1983, British singer Elvis Costello, a longtime fan of Baker, hired the trumpeter to play a solo on his song &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; for the album &quot;Punch the Clock&quot;. The song exposed Baker&#x27;s music to a new audience. Later, Baker often featured Costello&#x27;s song &quot;Almost Blue&quot; (in turn inspired by Baker&#x27;s version of &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;) in his concert sets.

In 1985, five years after meeting Brazilian pianist/composer Rique Pantoja in a club in Paris, Baker was invited by Pantoja to perform at the Free Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro. While in Brazil, Baker recorded trumpet and vocals for their duet album &quot;Rique Pantoja &amp; Chet Baker&quot;.

In 1986, &quot;Chet Baker: Live at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s London&quot; presented Baker in an intimate stage performance filmed with Elvis Costello and Van Morrison as he performed a set of standards and classics, including &quot;Just Friends&quot;, &quot;My Ideal&quot;, and &quot;Shifting Down&quot;. Augmenting the music, Baker spoke one-on-one with friend and colleague Costello about his childhood, career, and struggle with drugs.

Baker recorded the live album &quot;Chet Baker in Tokyo&quot; with his quartet featuring pianist Harold Danko, bassist Hein Van de Geyn, and drummer . Released eleven months before his death, John Vinocur named it &quot;a glorious moment in Chet Baker&#x27;s twilight.&quot;

In the winter of 1986, at a club in New York City, Baker met fashion photographer Bruce Weber. Weber convinced him to do a photo shoot for what was originally going to be only a three-minute film. When Baker started opening up to Weber, Weber convinced him to work on a longer film about his life. Filming began in January 1987. The finished film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;, is a highly acclaimed and stylized documentary that explores Baker&#x27;s talent and charm, the glamour of his youth now withered into a derelict state, and his turbulent, sensational romantic and family life. It was released in September 1988, four months after his death that May. Two accompanying soundtrack albums, one compiling highlights from the height of his fame and one featuring new material that Baker recorded during the filming of the documentary, were released in 1989.

=== Death ===
Early on May 13, 1988, Baker was found dead on the street below his room in Hotel Prins Hendrik, Amsterdam, with serious wounds to his head, apparently having fallen from the second-story window. Heroin and cocaine were found in his room and in his body. No evidence of a struggle was found, and the death was ruled an accident. According to another account, he inadvertently locked himself out of his room and fell while attempting to cross from the balcony of the vacant room adjacent to his own. A plaque was placed outside the hotel in his memory.

Baker is buried at the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, next to his father.

== Personal life ==
Chet Baker&#x27;s personal life was tumultuous, partly owing to a decades-long drug addiction which began in the 1950s and a nomadic lifestyle caused by touring. In 1980, he referred to his life as &quot;1/3 in a car, 1/3 sleeping, and 1/3 playing music.&quot;

His first short-lived marriage was to Charlaine Souder in 1950. In 1954, despite remaining married to Charlaine, he publicly dated French jazz club-goer Lili Cukier (later known as actress Liliane Rovère) for 2 years, introducing her to others as his wife. A photo of the couple taken by William Claxton appears as part of a collage on the cover of &quot;Chet Baker Sings and Plays&quot;.

Baker&#x27;s relationship with Lili ended when he informed her of his new marriage to Halema Alli. He married the 20-year-old Halema, 7 years his junior, in May 1956, one month after they met. The couple posed for a photograph by William Claxton, where Halema appears in a white dress and rests her head on Baker&#x27;s knee. They had a son, Chesney Aftab Baker, to whom Baker dedicated his composition, &quot;Chetty&#x27;s Lullaby.&quot; Baker was an irresponsible and distant father.

In a scandal heavily scrutinized by Italian tabloids, Halema was sent to prison for smuggling jetrium from Germany to Italy for her husband, though she claimed that she was unaware that she was breaking the law. To his wife&#x27;s humiliation, by the time of the trial, Baker had already started publicly dating Carol Jackson, a showgirl from Surrey. After being detained for six months, Halema returned to Inglewood, and their marriage essentially ended, though they remained legally married for several years because tracking down Baker for divorce proceedings was too difficult.

In 1962, Carol Jackson gave birth to a son, Dean. Two years later in 1964, Baker returned to the United States, and Halema was able to serve Baker divorce papers. Baker married Carol Jackson in 1964, and they had two more children, Paul in 1965 and Melissa (&quot;Missy&quot;) in 1966. Despite his inconsistency in remaining in his family&#x27;s life, and his infidelity, Carol and Chet never divorced.

In 1970, Baker met jazz drummer Diane Vavra. The two started an on-again off-again relationship that lasted until the end of his life. Beginning in the 1980s, she acted as his steady companion while touring Europe. She took care of his personal needs and assisted him with his career. The Library of Congress holds the correspondence of Chet and Diane. Chet dedicated his 1985 album &quot;Diane&quot; to Vavra, covering the familiar jazz standard &quot;Diane.&quot; For a time, Vavra took refuge at a women&#x27;s shelter due to Baker&#x27;s behavior.

In 1973, Baker began a relationship with Ruth Young, a jazz singer. She accompanied him on his 1975 tour in Europe, and he lived with her while stopping in New York. They dated, with interruptions, for about a decade. Together, they recorded two duets, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;Whatever Possessed Me,&quot; for the 1977 album &quot;The Incredible Chet Baker Plays and Sings&quot;.

Owing to his time in Italy, Baker was fluent in Italian.

Baker enjoyed driving and sports cars. In 1971, 1972, and 1975, Baker was arrested for drunk driving.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, Baker attempted to begin writing his memoirs. According to his wife Carol, he lost the draft while traveling on tour. In 1997, Carol Baker published and wrote an introduction to his &quot;lost memoirs,&quot; taped around 1978, under the title &quot;As Though I Had Wings&quot;. What writing exists is scant and idiosyncratic, and focuses mainly on his time in the army and his drug use.

==Compositions==

Some of Baker&#x27;s notable compositions include &quot;Chetty&#x27;s Lullaby&quot;, &quot;Freeway&quot;, &quot;Early Morning Mood&quot;, &quot;Two a Day&quot;, &quot;So che ti perderò&quot; (&quot;I Know I Will Lose You&quot;), &quot;Il mio domani&quot; (&quot;My Tomorrow&quot;), &quot;Motivo su raggio di luna&quot; (&quot;Contemplate on a Moonbeam&quot;), &quot;The Route&quot;, &quot;Skidaddlin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;New Morning Blues&quot; (with Duke Jordan), &quot;Blue Gilles&quot;, &quot;Dessert&quot;, &quot;Anticipated Blues&quot;, &quot;Blues for a Reason&quot;, &quot;We Know It&#x27;s Love&quot;, and &quot;Looking Good Tonight&quot;.

==Legacy==
Baker was photographed by William Claxton for his book &quot;Young Chet: The Young Chet Baker&quot;. An Academy Award-nominated 1988 documentary about Baker, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;, portrays him as a cultural icon of the 1950s while juxtaposing this with his later image as a drug addict. The film, directed by fashion photographer Bruce Weber, was shot in black-and-white, and includes a series of interviews with friends, family (including his three children by third wife Carol Baker), musical associates, and female friends, interspersed with footage from Baker&#x27;s earlier life, and interviews with Baker in his last years. In &quot;Chet Baker, His Life and Music&quot;, author Jeroen de Valk and others criticize the film for presenting Baker as a &quot;washed-up&quot; musician in his later years. The film was shot during the first half of 1987, the year before Baker&#x27;s death, ending in Cannes in May 1987, just prior to Baker&#x27;s June 14, 1987, Tokyo concert, released on &quot;Chet Baker in Tokyo&quot;. It premiered four months after Baker&#x27;s death.

&quot;Time after Time: The Chet Baker Project&quot;, written by playwright James O&#x27;Reilly, toured Canada in 2001.

Jeroen de Valk has written a biography of Baker; &quot;Chet Baker: His Life and Music&quot; is the English translation. Other biographies of him include James Gavin&#x27;s &quot;Deep in a Dream—The Long Night of Chet Baker&quot;, and Matthew Ruddick&#x27;s &quot;Funny Valentine&quot;. Baker&#x27;s &quot;lost memoirs&quot; are available in the book &quot;As Though I Had Wings&quot;, which includes an introduction by Carol Baker.

The 1960 film &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot;, starring Robert Wagner as a jazz trumpeter named Chad Bixby, was loosely inspired by Baker.

The 1999 film version of &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, Matt Damon plays a master of mimicry who imitates Baker&#x27;s recording of &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; from &quot;Chet Baker Sings&quot;.

Chet Baker is portrayed by Ethan Hawke in the 2015 film &quot;Born to Be Blue&quot;. It is a reimagining of Baker&#x27;s career in the late 1960s, when he is famous for both his music and his addiction, and he takes part in a movie about his life to boost his career. Steve Wall plays Baker in the 2018 film &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;.

American singer/songwriter David Wilcox included the tender biographical portrait &quot;Chet Baker&#x27;s Unsung Swan Song&quot; on his 1991 album &quot;Home Again&quot;. Vocalist Luciana Souza recorded &quot;The Book of Chet&quot; in 2012 as a tribute. Brazilian jazz pianist Eliane Elias dedicated her 2013 album &quot;I Thought About You&quot; to Chet Baker.

Australian musician Nick Murphy chose &quot;Chet Faker&quot; as his stage name as a tribute to Baker. Murphy said, &quot;I listened to a lot of jazz and I was a big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up, and intimate style. The name is kind of just an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music.&quot;

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Baker at number 116 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>Su Shi (; 8 January 1037 – 24 August 1101), courtesy name Zizhan (), art name Dongpo (), was a Chinese poet, essayist, calligrapher, painter, and scholar-official who lived during the Song dynasty. A major personality of the Song era, Su was an important figure in Song Dynasty politics, he had a lengthy career in bureaucracy, taking various provincial posts and briefly serving as a senior official at the imperial court. Despite his high hopes to serve the country, Su&#x27;s political career was filled with frustrations due to his out-spoken criticism, and he often fell victim to political rivalries between the radical and the conservative forces. He endured a series of political exiles during which his creative career flourished.

Su is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished figures in classical Chinese literature, leaving behind him a prolific collection of poems, lyrics, prose, and essays. His poetry had enduring popularity and influence in China and other areas in the near vicinity such as Japan, and is well known in some English-speaking countries through translations by Arthur Waley and Stephen Owen, among others. In arts, Su was described by Murck as &quot;the preeminent personality of the eleventh century.&quot; His prose writings contributed to the understanding of topics including 11th-century China&#x27;s travel literature and iron industry. His writing frequently touched upon the topic of cuisine, where he is considered to have had a profound influence. Dongpo pork, a prominent dish in Hangzhou cuisine, is named in his honor.

Su remains a revered and beloved figure among both intellectuals and the general populace, transcending the boundaries of his era. Contemporary researchers Zhu and Wang have observed that Su&#x27;s impact on the Chinese people&#x27;s values and beliefs is profound, asserting that his cultural and philosophical influence rivals that of notable philosophers like Mencius and Zhuangzi.

==Early life and education==
Su Shi was born in Meishan, near Mount Emei in Sichuan province. His father Su Xun and his younger brother Su Zhe were both renowned scholars. His given name &quot;Shi&quot; () refers to the crossbar railing at the front of a chariot. Su Xun remarked that the railing, although unassuming, played an essential role in the carriage, carrying his hopes and aspirations for Su Shi. 

Su Shi&#x27;s early education was conducted under a Daoist priest at a local village school. When he reached the age of 10, his education transitioned to homeschooling, initially guided by his mother, Lady Cheng, and subsequently by his father, Su Xun. Over the course of more than a decade, Su Xun dedicated himself to comprehensive studies of classical literature, philosophy, and historical texts, while providing coaching to his two adolescent sons as they prepared for the imperial examination. 

Su Shi married at the age of 17. Su Shi and his younger brother Su Zhe maintained a close relationship since their childhood.

== Official career ==

=== Initial success and fame ===
In 1057, at the age of 19, Su Shi and his brother both passed the highest-level civil service examinations and attained the degree of jinshi, a prerequisite for high government office. His accomplishments at such a young age attracted the attention of Emperor Renzong and leading literary figure Ouyang Xiu, who became Su&#x27;s patron thereafter. Ouyang had already been known as an admirer of Su Xun, endorsing his literary style at the imperial court and stating that no other pleased him more. When the 1057 jinshi examinations were given, Ouyang Xiu unexpectedly required candidates to write in the ancient prose style when answering questions on the Confucian classics. The Su brothers gained high honors for what were deemed impeccable answers and achieved celebrity status, particularly due to Su Shi&#x27;s exceptional performance in the subsequent 1061 decree examinations.

=== Provincial posts ===
Beginning in 1060 and throughout the following twenty years, Su Shi held a variety of government positions throughout China; most notably in Hangzhou, where he was responsible for constructing a pedestrian causeway across the West Lake that still bears the name &quot;sudi&quot; (, &#x27;Su causeway&#x27;). He had served as a magistrate in the Mi Prefecture, which is located in modern-day Zhucheng County in Shandong. Later, when he was governor of Xuzhou, he wrote a memorial to the throne in 1078 complaining about the troubling economic conditions and potential for armed rebellion in Liguo Industrial Prefecture, where a large part of the Chinese iron industry was located.

=== Political exiles ===

Su Shi was often at odds with the political faction headed by Wang Anshi. Su Shi once wrote a poem criticizing Wang Anshi&#x27;s reforms, especially the government monopoly imposed on the salt industry. The dominance of the reformist faction at court allowed the New Policy Group greater ability to have Su Shi exiled for political crimes. The claim was that Su Shi was criticizing the emperor, when in fact his poetry was aimed at criticizing Wang&#x27;s reforms. Wang Anshi played no part in this action against Su, for he had retired from public life in 1076 and established a cordial relationship with Su Shi. Su Shi&#x27;s first remote trip of exile (1080–1086) was to Huangzhou, Hubei. This post carried a nominal title, but no stipend, leaving Su in poverty. During this period, he began practicing Buddhist meditation. With help from a friend, Su built a small residence on a parcel of land in 1081. Su Shi lived at a farm called Dongpo (&#x27;Eastern Slope&#x27;), from which he took his literary pseudonym. While banished to Hubei province, he grew fond of the area he lived in; many of the poems considered his best were written in this period. His most famous piece of calligraphy, &quot;Han Shi Tie&quot;, was also written there. In 1086, Su Shi and all other banished statesmen were recalled to the capital due to the ascension of a new government. However, Su was banished a second time (1094–1100) to Huizhou and Danzhou, Hainan. In 1098 the Dongpo Academy in Hainan was built on the site of the residence that he lived in while in exile.

Although political bickering and opposition usually split ministers of court into rivaling groups, there were moments of non-partisanship and cooperation from both sides. For example, although the prominent scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was one of Wang Anshi&#x27;s most trusted associates and political allies, Shen nonetheless befriended Su Shi. Su Shi was aware that it was Shen Kuo who, as regional inspector of Zhejiang, presented Su Shi&#x27;s poetry to the court sometime between 1073 and 1075 with concern that it expressed abusive and hateful sentiments against the Song court. It was these poetry pieces that Li Ding and Shu Dan later utilized in order to instigate a law case against Su Shi, although until that point Su Shi did not think much of Shen Kuo&#x27;s actions in bringing the poetry to light.

=== The final years ===
In 1100, Su received a pardon and was posted to Chengdu, after a long period of political exile. However, he died in Changzhou, Jiangsu after his period of exile while en route to his new assignment in the year 1101. Su Shi was 64 years old. After his death he gained even greater popularity, as people sought to collect his calligraphy, depicted him in paintings, marked his visit to numerous places with stone inscriptions and built shrines in his honor. He was also depicted in artwork made posthumously, such as in Li Song&#x27;s (1190–1225) painting of Su traveling in a boat, known as &quot;Su Dongpo at Red Cliff&quot;, after Su Song&#x27;s poem written about the 3rd-century battle.

==Family==

Su Shi had three wives. His first wife was Wang Fu (1039–1065) from Sichuan, who was sixteen when they married. She died on the second day of the fifth month 13 years later, after bearing him a son, Su Mai (). Heartbroken, Su Shi wrote a memorial (), stating that Wang had not just been a virtuous wife, but had also frequently advised him regarding the integrity of his acquaintances during his time as an official.

Ten years after the death of his first wife, Su Shi composed a &quot;ci&quot; poem after dreaming of her while in Mi Prefecture. The poem, &quot;To the tune ,&quot;River Town&quot; (), remains one of the most famous poems Su Shi wrote. 

In 1068, two years after Wang&#x27;s death, Su Shi married her cousin Wang Runzhi (, 1048–1093), who was 11 years his junior. Wang Runzhi spent the next 25 years accompanying Su Shi through his ups and downs in officialdom and political exile. Su Shi praised Runzhi for being an understanding wife who treated his three sons equally (his eldest, Su Mai (), was born by Wang Fu). Once, Su Shi was angry with his young son for not understanding his unhappiness during his political exile. Wang Runzhi chided Su Shi for his silliness, prompting Su Shi to write the domestic poem &quot;Young Son&quot; ().

Wang Runzhi died in 1093, at forty-six, after bearing two sons, Su Dai () and Su Guo (). Overwhelmed by grief, Su Shi expressed his wish to be buried with her in her memorial (). 

Su&#x27;s third wife, Wang Zhaoyun (, 1062–1095) was a former Qiantang courtesan. Wang was about twelve when Su bought her at Hangzhou. Zhaoyun learned to read and write at Su&#x27;s house. Of all the women in Su&#x27;s life, Zhaoyun was probably the most famous, as she tried to &quot;grow to her husband&#x27;s spiritual level&quot;, and who seems to &quot;understands him best&quot;. Su expressed his gratitude to Zhaoyun for her companionship to his exile in his old age, as well as her shared quest with the poet for immortal life via Buddhist and Taoist practice.

Su&#x27;s friend, fellow poet Qin Guan wrote a poem, &quot;A Gift for Dongpo&#x27;s concubine Zhaoyun&quot; (), praising her beauty and lovely voice. Su Shi himself dedicated a number of his poems to Zhaoyun, including &quot;To the Tune of &#x27;Song of the South&#x27;&quot;(), &quot;Verses for Zhaoyun&quot; (), &quot;To the Tune of &#x27;The Beauty Who Asks One To Stay&#x27;&quot; (), and &quot;To the Tune of &#x27;The Moon at Western Stream&#x27;&quot; (). Zhaoyun remained a faithful companion to Su Shi after Runzhi&#x27;s death, and died of illness on 13 August 1095 () at Huizhou. Zhaoyun bore Su Shi a son, Su Dun (), on 15 November 1083, who died in infancy. After Zhaoyun&#x27;s death, Su Shi never married again.

Being a government official in a family of officials, Su Shi was often separated from his loved ones depending on his posting. In 1078, he was serving as prefect of Suzhou. His beloved younger brother was able to join him for the mid-autumn festival, which inspired the poem &quot;Mid-Autumn Moon&quot; reflecting on the preciousness of time with family. It was written to be sung to the tune of &quot;Yang Pass.&quot;

Su Shi had three sons who survived to adulthood: the eldest, Su Mai (), who would also become a government official by 1084; the second, Su Dai (); and the third, Su Guo (). When Su Shi died in 1101, his younger brother Su Zhe () buried him alongside his second wife Wang Runzhi according to his wishes.

==Work==
===Overview===

Approximately 2,700 poems and 800 letters penned by Su Shi have been preserved to date. His mastery spanned across various forms, including the &quot;shi&quot;, &quot;ci&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; styles of poetry, as well as prose, calligraphy, and painting. While a significant portion of his poetry is in the shi format, it is his 350 ci style poems that largely cemented his poetic legacy. 

Su Shi&#x27;s repertoire also includes a substantial body of essays, with many focusing on politics and governance. One of them being Liuhoulun (留侯論). He is recognized as one of the most esteemed essayists of the Tang and Song dynasties, earning him a place among the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song.

In both his literary creations and visual artistry, Su Shi seamlessly blended elements of spontaneity, objectivity with detailed and vivid depictions of the natural world.

=== Poetry ===
Su Shi is renowned as a founding figure of the &quot;háofàng&quot; school in ci poetry, characterized by a spirit of boldness and a broader theme. Su Shi expanded the &quot;ci&quot; genre&#x27;s thematic range, infusing it with a variety of non-traditional topics, many of which were drawn from his own life experiences. His lyrics delved into deeper, more contemplative subjects like aging, mortality, and the intricacies of public service, resonating more profoundly with contemporary audiences. As an innovator of the háofàng style, he introduced elements typically associated with masculine activities, including hunting motifs, and intertwined Buddhist philosophical concepts and political references, traditionally reserved for more esteemed forms of poetry. 

Some of his notable poetry works include the First and Second &quot;Chibifu&quot; ( &quot;The Red Cliffs&quot;, written during his first exile), &quot;Nian Nu Jiao: Chibi Huai Gu&quot; ( &quot;Remembering Chibi, to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao&quot;) and &quot;Shui diao ge tou&quot; ( &quot;Remembering Su Zhe on the Mid-Autumn Festival&quot;, ). The two former fu-style poems were inspired by the Battle of Chibi, a naval battle of the Three Kingdoms era that occurred in the year 208.

In one of his &quot;shi style&quot; poems, Su famously described the difficulty of conveying Mount Lu&#x27;s beauty: &quot;Why can&#x27;t I tell the true shape of Mount Lu? Because I myself am in the mountain.&quot;

Su wrote multiple poems at Huangzhou amid political banishment; in fact, the Huangzhou exile was a most prolific period for the poet. 

One of the examples is a playful and biting poem on the first bath of his new-born son by his third wife Zhaoyun. 

 &quot;On the Birth of a Son&quot; .&quot;&quot;Immortal by the River&quot; Returning at Night to Linggao&quot; (臨江仙 · 夜歸臨皋)&quot; (written in 1082 CE): 

Composed in 1082 CE, this song reflects the period when Su Shi faced demotion and relocation, now known as the Huangzhou district in Hubei Province. Despite enduring political adversity, Su Shi maintained an appreciation for the natural world. The lyrics convey his aspiration to abandon the chase for status, fame, and wealth, and instead embrace a life of seclusion.
&quot;&quot;Settling Wind Waves (Ding feng-bo) (定風波)&quot;&quot;:
His popular politically charged poetry was often the reason for the wrath of Wang Anshi&#x27;s supporters towards him, culminating with the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial of 1079. 

He also wrote poems on Buddhist topics, including a poem later extensively commented on by Eihei Dōgen, founder of the Japanese Sōtō school of Zen, in a chapter of his work Shōbōgenzō entitled &quot;The Sounds of Valley Streams, the Forms of Mountains&quot;.

=== Travel record literature ===
Su Shi also wrote of his travel experiences in &#x27;daytrip essays&#x27;, which belonged in part to the popular Song era literary category of &#x27;travel record literature&#x27; (youji wenxue) that employed the use of narrative, diary, and prose styles of writing. Although other works in Chinese travel literature contained a wealth of cultural, geographical, topographical, and technical information, the central purpose of the daytrip essay was to use a setting and event in order to convey a philosophical or moral argument, which often employed persuasive writing. For example, Su Shi&#x27;s daytrip essay known as &quot;Record of Stone Bell Mountain&quot; investigates and then judges whether or not ancient texts on &#x27;stone bells&#x27; were factually accurate.
===A memorial on the Chinese iron industry===

While acting as Governor of Xuzhou in 1078, Su wrote a memorial to the imperial court about issues faced in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture was under his administration. In an interesting and revealing passage about the Chinese iron industry during the latter half of the 11th century, Su Shi wrote about the enormous size of the workforce employed in the iron industry, competing provinces that had rival iron manufacturers seeking favor from the central government, as well as the danger of rising local strongmen who had the capability of raiding the industry and threatening the government with effectively armed rebellion. It also becomes clear in reading the text that prefectural government officials in Su&#x27;s time often had to negotiate with the central government in order to meet the demands of local conditions.

===Technical issues of hydraulic engineering===

During the ancient Han dynasty (202 BCE220 CE) of China, the sluice gate and canal lock of the flash lock had been known. By the 10th century the latter design was improved upon in China with the invention of the canal pound lock, allowing different adjusted levels of water along separated and gated segments of a canal. This innovation allowed for larger transport barges to pass safely without danger of wrecking upon the embankments, and was an innovation praised by those such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Shen also wrote in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; of the year 1088 that, if properly used, sluice gates positioned along irrigation canals were most effective in depositing silt for fertilization. Writing earlier in his &quot;Dongpo Zhilin&quot; of 1060, Su Shi came to a different conclusion, writing that the Chinese of a few centuries past had perfected this method and noted that it was ineffective in use by his own time.

Although Su Shi made no note of it in his writing, the root of this problem was merely the needs of agriculture and transportation conflicting with one another.

===Gastronome===
Su is called one of the four classical gastronomes. The other three are Ni Zan (1301–74), Xu Wei (1521–93), and Yuan Mei (1716–97). There is a legend, for which there is no evidence, that by accident he invented Dongpo pork, a famous dish in later centuries. Lin Hsiang Ju and Lin Tsuifeng in their scholarly &quot;Chinese Gastronomy&quot; give a recipe, &quot;The Fragrance of Pork: Tungpo Pork&quot;, and remark that the &quot;square of fat is named after Su Dongpo, the poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would have liked it.&quot; A story runs that once Su Shi had decided to make stewed pork. Then an old friend visited him in the middle of the cooking and challenged him to a game of Chinese chess. Su Shi had totally forgotten the stew, which in the meantime had now become extremely thick-cooked, until its very fragrant smell reminded him of it. Some legends point to the contrary, however, where other villagers simply named the pork dish after him to honour his death, although no concrete evidence points to any conclusion.

Su, to explain his vegetarian inclinations, said that he never had been comfortable with killing animals for his dinner table, but had a craving for certain foods, such as clams, so he could not desist. When he was imprisoned his views changed: &quot;Since my imprisonment I have not killed a single thing... having experienced such worry and danger myself, when I felt just like a fowl waiting in the kitchen, I can no longer bear to cause any living creature to suffer immeasurable fright and pain simply to please my palate.&quot;

<text>Illán de Vacas is a town in the province of Toledo, in Castile–La Mancha, Spain. The surface area of the municipality is 9 km2, it has a total population of 3 inhabitants, making it the least populated municipality in Spain.

Illán de Vacas belongs to the &quot;comarca&quot; of Torrijos. It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Los Cerralbos, on the northwest by Otero, on the east by Domingo Pérez, on the south by Cebolla and on the west by Lucillos.

The town lies at an elevation of roughly 480 m, and 59 km west of Toledo and 35 km east of Talavera de la Reina, on the railway line between Talavera and Torrijos. It is approximately 95 km southwest of Madrid.

The mayor of Illán de Vacas is Julián Renilla Bru of the Partido Popular. In the 2004 General Election in Spain, all four votes cast at Illán de Vacas went to the Partido Popular.

The municipality contains a church consecrated to the Assumption of Our Lady (&quot;Iglesia de la Asunción de Nuestra Señora&quot;).

==Toponymy==
The word &quot;Illán&quot; derives from the Latin . The town&#x27;s name stems from the worship of &quot;San Illán&quot; or &quot;San Julián&quot; (&quot;Saint Julian&quot;). The word &quot;de&quot; simply means &quot;of&quot;. The last word, , despite its current meaning in Spanish – namely &quot;cows&quot; – apparently has an Arabic origin, deriving from a word &quot;Wakka&quot;. In a document from the latter half of the 16th century, it says that the town&#x27;s name is &quot;Vacas&quot;, and that a fortunate man named Illán lived there.

==Demographics==
The following table shows the population development between 1996 and 2007 according to data from the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística&quot; (INE). With 5 inhabitants, according to the INE&#x27;s 2011 census, Illán de Vacas is one of Spain&#x27;s two smallest municipalities by population. At one point (1991), it even temporarily became a ghost town.

==History==
In the past, the town was tied to Los Cerralbos with its beginnings as a workhouse. Illán de Vacas appears in a 1512 document that indicates that three soldiers were captured here. In the 17th century, this hamlet was repopulated with 37 families. In the mid 19th century, it had 22 houses and the municipal budget rose to 2,200 reales, of which 800 reales were used to pay the secretary.

<text>Clara Collet (10 September 1860 – 3 August 1948) was a British economist and civil servant. She was one of the first women graduates from the University of London and was pivotal in many reforms which greatly improved working conditions and pay for women during the early part of the twentieth century. She is also noted for the collection of statistical and descriptive evidence on the life of working women and poor people in London and elsewhere in England.

== Education ==
Her Unitarian father, Collet Dobson Collet, sent her to the North London Collegiate School close to where she lived, which was one of the most liberated schools for girls at that time. When finishing her education at the Collegiate School in 1878, she was recommended by the founder of the school, Frances Buss, to work as assistant mistress at the newly founded Wyggeston Girls&#x27; School in Leicester, later to become Regent College. Her salary was £80 and she got herself coached by masters from the boy&#x27;s grammar school in Greek and applied mathematics.

Collet also enrolled at University College London and in 1880 graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, making her one of the first women graduates from the University of London. In October 1885 Collet moved to College Hall, on Gordon Square, and started to study for a master&#x27;s degree in Moral and Political Philosophy, which included psychology and economics. While studying at University College London she took the Teacher&#x27;s Diploma. In 1886 she and Henry Higgs were jointly awarded the Joseph Hume Scholarship in Political Economy. Collet was awarded an M.A. in 1887.

== Documenting women&#x27;s work ==
After completion of her master&#x27;s degree she worked for Charles Booth helping in his great investigative work on the conditions prevailing in late nineteenth century London. To this end she took up residency in the East End during the autumn of 1888. She was working on a chapter on women&#x27;s work in Booth&#x27;s survey &quot;Life and Labour of the People of London&quot;.

Booth had planned for a chapter on women&#x27;s work in his survey. In 1887 Alice Stopford Green started the investigation on women&#x27;s work and wages, but in November 1888 she left Booth&#x27;s project. Booth asked Beatrice Webb if she could complete the women&#x27;s work study by March 1889. Webb was working on the study of the Jewish community, which had to be completed in February. Records show that Collet started work on the women&#x27;s work survey in late November. It is not documented how Collet was recruited to Booth&#x27;s team. Webb and Collet had a mutual friend, Eleanor Marx, and Collet had in 1887 attended the Toynbee Hall conference on women&#x27;s work and wages, which had also been attended by Booth. Collet was formally employed by Booth in late 1888 and took over Green&#x27;s study of women&#x27;s work in the East End of London and contributed to Graham Balfour&#x27;s study of Battersea Street. In 1890 she studied the Ashby-de-la-Zouch workhouse for Booth&#x27;s work on the Poor Law Unions.

In her diaries Collet recorded that &quot;this investigative work has many drawbacks... I would give it up and will give it up whenever I see a chance of earning a certain £60 even by lectures on economics&quot;. While working for Booth she coached girls and occasionally stood in for Henry Higgs to give lectures on economics at Toynbee Hall. Collet ended her employment with Booth in 1892. She remained close to Booth and her former colleagues. In 1904 she and her former colleagues attended Booth&#x27;s celebratory dinner in 1904. In 1931 she contributed data on domestic service to Hubert Llewellyn Smith&#x27;s &quot;New Survey of London Life and Labour&quot;.

== Civil service career ==
Collet joined the Civil Service and worked with the Board of Trade to introduce many reforms, including the introduction of the Old Age Pension and labour exchanges (employment bureaux). During these years she worked with well-known politicians such as David Lloyd George, Ramsay MacDonald, William Beveridge and Winston Churchill.

With the support of Charles Booth she initially joined the civil service as Assistant Commissioner for the Royal Commission on Labour. In 1893 she secured a permanent post as Senior Investigator for Women&#x27;s Industries at the Labour Department of the Board of Trade. Collet retired from the civil service in 1920 and became an active member of the Royal Economic Society and the Royal Statistical Society.

== Private life ==
Her family became acquainted with Karl Marx and Clara became especially friendly with his daughter Eleanor Marx. Collet was a friend of George Gissing during the last ten years of his life (they first met in July 1893), and she offered to act as guardian to his two sons when it became clear his second wife, Edith, would find it hard to cope financially after his death. At this time she also became engaged in a long disagreement with H. G. Wells over the foreword of Gissing&#x27;s posthumously published novel &quot;Veranilda&quot;.

== Publications ==
For Charles Booth&#x27;s survey &quot;Life and Labour of the People of London&quot; Collet
authored &quot;Secondary Education; Girls&quot;, &quot;West End Tailoring (Women)&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Work&quot; and &quot;Report on the Money Wages of Indoor Domestic Servants&quot;. Collet remained interested in the study of women&#x27;s work for the rest of her life and published articles on the economic position of women. Such as:
*&quot;The Economic Position of Educated Working Women&quot; (1902)
*&quot;Women in Industry&quot; (1911)
*&quot;Changes in Wages and Conditions of Domestic Servants in private Families and Institutions in the County of London&quot; Collet &amp; Daphne Sanger (1930)

<doc id="308285" wikidata="Q377506" url="?curid=308285" title="Robert M. La Follette Jr.">
<text>Robert Marion La Follette Jr. (February 6, 1895 – February 24, 1953) was an American politician who served as United States senator from Wisconsin from 1925 to 1947. A member of the La Follette family, he was often referred to by the nickname &quot;Young Bob&quot; to distinguish him from his father, Robert M. &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; La Follette, who had served as a U.S. senator and governor of Wisconsin. Robert Jr., along with his brother Philip La Follette, carried on their father&#x27;s legacy of progressive politics and founded the Wisconsin Progressive Party. Robert Jr. was the last major Progressive Party politician in the U.S. Senate, ending in 1946 when the party disbanded. La Follette was defeated in the 1946 Republican Senate primary by Joseph McCarthy.

His son, Bronson La Follette was also a prominent politician in Wisconsin, serving as the 36th &amp; 39th attorney general of Wisconsin.

==Background==
La Follette was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Robert M. &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; La Follette and his wife Belle Case La Follette. He had three siblings, including Philip La Follette and Fola La Follette.

La Follette attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1913 to 1917 but he did not graduate because of a severe streptococcus infection. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Wisconsin in 1938. The same illness kept him out of the military during World War I.

==Career==
La Follette served as his father&#x27;s private secretary between 1919 and 1925.

===Republican===
On September 29, 1925, La Follette was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of his father. &quot;Young Bob&quot;, as he was called, was a champion of organized labor. He gained national prominence between 1936 and 1940 as chairman of a special Senate investigating committee, commonly called the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee, that exposed the surveillance, physical intimidation, and other techniques used by large employers to prevent workers from organizing.

He was chairman of the Committee on Manufactures in the 71st and 72nd Congresses. He supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt and most New Deal legislation until he broke over the passage of the 1938 naval expansion bill.
He was re-elected as a Republican in 1928, and as a Progressive in 1934 and 1940.

===Progressive, Isolationist===
With his brother Philip, he formed the Wisconsin Progressive Party in 1934, and for a time the party was dominant in Wisconsin. He was reelected with the Progressive Party in 1934 and 1940. One of the Senate&#x27;s leading isolationists, La Follette helped found the America First Committee in 1940.

In April 1943 a confidential analysis by English researcher Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that La Follette was the: 

===Republican===
When the Wisconsin Progressive Party dissolved, La Follette returned to the Republican Party in 1946. He helped to draft and win passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 that modernized the legislative process in Congress.

===Defeat===

La Follette was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection as a Republican in 1946. He ran an isolationist campaign against the United Nations and was critical of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin; he ended up narrowly losing to Joseph McCarthy in the Republican primary, by 207,935 votes to 202,557. While La Follette initially started with a large lead in the polls, that lead gradually dwindled, and on the primary election day, the results of the final county to report polls tipped the scales in McCarthy&#x27;s favor. La Follette sent a one-word telegram saying &quot;Congratulations&quot; to McCarthy.

La Follette made several decisions that hurt his primary campaign. Disbanding the Progressive Party and seeking election on the Republican ticket that same year cost him the support of many progressive supporters that belonged to the former, while the more conservative Republicans were also suspicious of La Follette, for he had previously run against them. Being initially confident of victory, he further hurt his chances by staying on in Washington to draft and win passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 rather than returning to Wisconsin to campaign for re-election.

La Follette faced an aggressive campaign by McCarthy and failed to refute the latter&#x27;s charges, several of which were false. McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed and would have been too old to be accepted. McCarthy played up his own wartime service, using his wartime nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot;, and the slogan &quot;Congress needs a tail-gunner&quot;. McCarthy also claimed that while he had been away fighting for his country, La Follette had made huge profits from investments; the suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of war profiteering was deeply damaging. (In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943. La Follette&#x27;s investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.)

Arnold Beichman later stated that McCarthy &quot;was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist-controlled United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, CIO&quot;, which preferred McCarthy to the anti-communist Robert M. La Follette. This allegation, however, has never been proved.

After his defeat by McCarthy, La Follette was a foreign aid advisor to the Truman administration.

In a &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; article of February 8, 1947, La Follette reported infiltration of Communists onto Congressional committee staffs. He wrote, &quot;I know from firsthand experience that Communist sympathizers have infiltrated into committee staffs on Capitol Hill in Washington.&quot; He cited his own former subcommittee, as well as the Kilgore Subcommittee on War Mobilization and the Murray Social Committee on Small Business. He named some half-dozen CIO affiliates as being openly pro-Communist: United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE), International Fur &amp; Leather Workers Union (IFLWU), United Public Workers of America (UPWA), Transport Workers Union, Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Farm Equipment and Metal Workers, the United Furniture Workers of America (UFW), and the American Communications Association. He also stated that the difficult people to deal with were not &quot;avowed Communists&quot; but &quot;fellow travelers&quot; because &quot;There is no litmus-paper test for these people.&quot; The only people he named were union leaders: Abram Flaxer of the UPWA, Reid Robinson of the MMSW, Ben Gold of the Furriers, Michael Quill of the TWU, and Joseph Ryan of the IL.

In August 1947, Washington-based columnist Marquis Childs reported that La Follette was &quot;comfortably established in his own offices in Washington as an economic consultant to several large corporations.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1930, La Follette married Rachel Wilson Young. They had two children, Joseph Oden La Follette and Bronson Cutting La Follette.

On February 24, 1953, La Follette was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound just days after his 58th birthday in Washington, D.C. His aide Wilbur Voight stated he &quot;apparently had been despondent over a lingering heart condition&quot;.

La Follette was interred at Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin, and was survived by his sons, Bronson La Follette, who served as Wisconsin&#x27;s attorney general from 1965 to 1969 and from 1975 to 1987, and Joseph Oden La Follette, who spent his career working at IBM.

On September 9, 1953, John Lautner testified before McCarthy&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, revealing the existence of the Communists who had served on La Follette&#x27;s subcommittee staff. Some historians believe that La Follette killed himself out of fear of being exposed by McCarthy; others believe he succumbed to anxiety and depression that had plagued him for much of his life.

<text>Portage is a package management system originally created for and used by Gentoo Linux and also by ChromeOS, Calculate, and Funtoo Linux among others. Portage is based on the concept of ports collections. Gentoo is sometimes referred to as a &quot;meta-distribution&quot; due to the extreme flexibility of Portage, which makes it operating-system-independent. The Gentoo/Alt project was concerned with using Portage to manage other operating systems, such as BSDs, macOS and Solaris. The most notable of these implementations is the Gentoo/FreeBSD project.

There is an ongoing effort called the Package Manager Specification project (PMS), which aims to standardise and document the behaviour of Portage, allowing the ebuild tree and Gentoo system packages to be used with alternative package managers such as Paludis and pkgcore. Its goal is to specify the exact set of features and behaviour of package managers and ebuilds, serving as an authoritative reference for Portage.

==Overview==
===Accessing Portage===

Portage is similar to the BSD-style package management known as ports, and was originally designed with FreeBSD&#x27;s ports in mind. Portage is written in the Python programming language, and is the main utility that defines Gentoo. Although the system itself is known as Portage, it consists of two main parts, the &quot;ebuild&quot; system and &quot;emerge&quot;. The ebuild system takes care of the actual work of building and installing packages, while emerge provides an interface to ebuild: managing an ebuild repository, resolving dependencies and similar issues. (These two therefore have roughly the same relation as rpm has with yum, or dpkg has with APT.)

A GTK-based GUI, Porthole, is available for working with Portage.
There is also the Himerge GUI, which stands for &quot;Haskell Interface for eMerge&quot;.

===Functions provided===
Portage is characterized by its main function: compiling from source code the packages the user wishes to install. In doing so it allows customization of compiler and target-application options to fit the system&#x27;s specifications and the user&#x27;s own wishes. Functionalities related to system management include: allowing parallel package-version installation, tracking cross-package dependencies, managing a database of installed packages, providing a local ebuild repository, and synchronizing of the local Portage tree with remote repositories. Functionalities related to individual package installation include: specifying compilation settings for the target machine and choosing package components.

Portage distinguishes between three levels of stability in ebuilds: &quot;stable&quot; (e.g., the software works as intended with no known security issues at time of release), &quot;keyword masked&quot; (mainly for packages that have not been sufficiently tested on the target system architecture to be considered stable) and &quot;hard masked&quot; (broken or very insecure) packages.

==Features==
===Emerge===

The emerge command-line tool is the heart of Portage. The command is customizable with many options and modifiers. The emerge tool is the most important utility for accessing the features of Portage from the command line.

The program calculates and manages dependencies, executes ebuilds and maintains the local Portage tree and database of installed packages. The compilation settings used by ebuilds can be changed through the CFLAGS environment variable, based on the specifications of the individual computer and on the user&#x27;s desire for optimization. The emerge utility executes ebuilds in a sandbox environment. This way the system is protected from software executed by the ebuild and resulting binaries are only merged after a successful build and sandboxed install.

What emerge installs as dependencies is affected by the USE flag-settings. They decide which optional features will be included when installing or upgrading an application. The emerge command can also be used to download and install precompiled binary files.

===USE flags===

The Portage system offers the use of &quot;USE flags&quot;, which allows users to indicate which software features they would like to include (and exclude) while building packages. For example, there is a USE flag to include DVD support, where available, in packages compiled with the flag enabled. The USE flags affect which dependencies are required, generally affecting which optional features will be built into a given program when it is compiled. For example, in packages which use a configure script, the USE flag codice_1 would translate to codice_2.

The specification of USE flags is the usual way to configure programs on Gentoo. USE flags may be set manually, or via user-friendly tools such as &#x27;ufed&#x27; (USE flag editor), which lists flags along with their description. A list of available USE flags is available at the Gentoo website&#x27;s USE Flag Index.

===ebuild===
Gentoo does not, by default, use binary packages as other package management systems do (like pacman or apt), employing instead a format known as the ebuild. Whereas RPM binaries are precompiled binaries, ebuilds are shell scripts with variables and functions which contain a description of the software, and instructions on how to obtain, configure, compile, and install it, more closely akin to (but more powerful than) the .spec files distributed in SRPMs. The official repository provides over 19,600 ebuilds, the majority of which are distributed by the Gentoo mirrors. New and updated ebuilds can be obtained by synchronizing the local ebuild repositories with the mirrors. This is done by executing the command codice_3. Historically, Gentoo has provided pre-compiled binary packages for many common programs, especially those which are lengthy to compile, such as Mozilla Firefox and OpenOffice.org. These are still installed with emerge, just by appending a &quot;-bin&quot; to the package name to instead install the binary version.

===Binary packages===
Gentoo does have a binary packaging format, which is a &quot;.tbz2&quot; file (tar with bzip2 compression) with additional metadata. This feature enables the building of binary packages on one system (using Portage&#x27;s codice_4 or codice_5) followed by quick installation on compatible systems (with Portage&#x27;s codice_6 or codice_7). See Portage Features in the Gentoo Linux Handbook for more information.

===Masking===
&quot;Masking&quot; is how Gentoo determines which packages are suitable for a system. Ebuilds designed for different architectures or experimental software are usually masked in a manner which prevents a stable system from installing them without user intervention.

Packages that generally just require some testing but will often work fine are said to be &quot;keyword masked&quot; (i.e. they are available for systems with an ACCEPT_KEYWORDS make.conf entry starting with the character codice_8, such as codice_9, codice_10, codice_11). An individual &quot;keyword masked&quot; package can be unmasked by adding a line with the full package name and keyword to some file within the codice_12 directory. Users can make subdirectories here as well, allowing for custom organization. For example, if a masked package had multiple masked dependencies, the user could make a directory with the name of the original masked package, and put all the mask files for the package and its dependencies in that directory. This scheme replaces the older scheme of having codice_13 as one text file.

Packages with known problems or not considered mature enough to be candidates for stable are &quot;hard masked&quot; by one of the various package.mask files in /usr/portage/profiles, and such entries are generally accompanied by a comment from developers explaining the reason for the mask.
== Gentoo/Alt ==
Gentoo/Alt is a project created to manage porting the portage framework and other features to other operating systems, such as Mac OS X and the free BSDs. Gentoo/Alt was set up by Pieter Van den Abeele and Daniel Robbins after Pieter Van den Abeele founded Gentoo for Mac OS X.
=== Mac OS X ===
Gentoo for Mac OS X was the first non-Linux project of Gentoo and focused on making the Gentoo experience available on Apple&#x27;s operating system by introducing the Portage system as a separate entity. This was roughly similar to Fink and MacPorts, but it used Portage instead of a Debian-like or Ports-like system. Later on, Gentoo for Mac OS X was made a subproject of Gentoo/Alt. The project is no longer active, because its prime assumption of using and not modifying the host OS appeared not to be realistic and eventually broke most packages or made them hardly maintainable. Gentoo for Mac OS X has been superseded by Gentoo Prefix, which is currently what Gentoo offers to Mac OS X users.

The Prefix project on Mac OS X is tested and supported on Mac OS X Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard on PowerPC, IA-32, and x86-64 architectures.

=== FreeBSD ===
Gentoo/FreeBSD brings the Gentoo Linux design, structure, and tools such as Portage and the Gentoo Linux base layout to the FreeBSD operating system. Gentoo&#x27;s GNU toolchain is used instead of the original FreeBSD one.

Although the project is no longer maintained by any active Gentoo developers, there are instructions that allow installation of a full Gentoo/FreeBSD system. FreeBSD system ebuilds are integrated into the main portage tree, but this port is far from being complete due to the amount of packages needing to be ported and the lack of a proper Live CD (FreeSBIE&#x27;s Live CD or FreeBSD setup CD is used during installation).

The current (semi) official logo for Gentoo/FreeBSD is a daemonized &quot;g&quot;, derived from original Gentoo Linux logo and inspired by the BSD Daemon. It was designed by Marius Morawski, responding to an unofficial contest launched by Diego Elio Pettenò on his blog.

=== NetBSD ===
Gentoo/NetBSD is a project to provide a GNU userland managed by Portage with a NetBSD kernel. The project was started by Damian Florczyk. Only the x86 architecture is targeted and the system as a whole is in an incomplete state.

=== OpenBSD ===

Gentoo/OpenBSD was a Gentoo/*BSD subproject to port Gentoo features such as Portage to the OpenBSD operating system. It was originally started by Grant Goodyear and is deprecated. An install guide is provided on the project page but is also marked as deprecated.

=== DragonFlyBSD ===
Gentoo/DragonFlyBSD is a currently unofficial port to the DragonFlyBSD kernel. The project is developed by Robert Sebastian Gerus.

=== GNU Hurd ===
An unofficial port to GNU Hurd was also being developed, but was abandoned in late 2006.

=== Android ===
Led by Benda Xu, &quot;Gentoo RAP for Android Devices&quot; installs a variant of Gentoo called Gentoo RAP in a directory prefix alongside Android. The Linux kernel is used by both Android and Gentoo RAP.

=== Interix ===
Gentoo/Interix (eprefix) is a port of Gentoo that runs atop the Interix Subsystem for Windows which is also known as Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) or Subsystem for Unix-based Applications (SUA). A result of the Gentoo/Interix project is the ability to install and use the Portage system to emerge native Windows applications (requires Visual Studio, 2008 Express Edition will do too). However, this feature does not support the wide variety of packages supported by other platforms (including Interix).

=== Portaris ===
An unofficial port to the Solaris operating system, &quot;Portaris&quot;, was announced around 2006, but never got into a public state. It was superseded by the Gentoo Prefix project.

===Plan 9===
Started in 2011 as a Google Summer of Code project, Plan 9 For Gentoo takes the Gentoo base and overlays a userspace inspired by Plan 9. The stated objectives of the project are to have better hardware support, better software support and to create a &quot;culture shock&quot; for people that have previously used Linux systems. The project is maintained by Robert Seaton.

<text>Mangalore ( ), officially known as Mangaluru (), is a major industrial port city in the Indian state of Karnataka and on the west coast of India. It is located between the Laccadive Sea and the Western Ghats about west of Bangalore, the state capital, 14 km north of Karnataka–Kerala border and 297 km south of Goa. Mangalore is the state&#x27;s only city to have all four modes of transport—air, road, rail and sea. The population of the urban agglomeration was 619,664  national census of India. It is known for being one of the locations of the Indian strategic petroleum reserves.

The city developed as a port in the Laccadive Sea during ancient times, and after Independence a new port was constructed in 1968 and has since become a major port of India that handles 75 percent of India&#x27;s coffee and cashew exports. It is also the country&#x27;s seventh largest container port. Mangalore has been ruled by several major powers, including the Mauryan empire, Kadambas, Alupas, Vijayanagar Empire, and Keladi Nayaks. The city was a source of contention between the British and the Kingdom of Mysore rulers Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and was eventually annexed by the British in 1799. Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India&#x27;s independence in 1947 and was unified with Mysore State (now called Karnataka) in 1956.

Mangalore is one of the fastest developing cities in India. The Dakshina Kannada district with its administrative headquarters at Mangalore has the highest Per Capita Income and Gross State Domestic Product in Karnataka, after Bangalore. Mangalore is a commercial, industrial, business, educational, healthcare, and startup hub. Mangalore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration which manages the 60 wards of the city. Its landscape is characterised by rolling hills, coconut palms, rivers, and hard laterite soil.

Mangalore is included as one of the cities in the Smart Cities Mission list and is among the 100 smart cities to be developed in India. It has an average elevation of above mean sea level. It has a tropical monsoon climate and is under the influence of the southwest monsoon. It has its own International Airport which is around 15 km from the city centre.

==Etymology==

Mangalore was named after the deity Mangaladevi, the presiding deity of the Mangaladevi Temple, or a synonym of the goddess Tara of the Vajrayana Buddhist sect. According to local legend, a princess named Parimala or Premaladevi from Malabar renounced her kingdom and became a disciple of Matsyendranath, the founder of the Nath tradition. Having converted Premaladevi to the Nath sect, Matsyendranath renamed her &quot;Mangaladevi&quot;. She arrived in the area with Matsyendranath, but had to settle near Bolar in Mangalore because she fell ill on the way. When she died, the people consecrated the Mangaladevi temple at Bolar in her honour. The city was named for the temple.

One of the earliest references to the city&#x27;s name was in 715 CE when Pandyan King Chettian called the city &quot;Mangalapuram&quot;. The city and the coastal region were part of the Pandyan Kingdom. According to K.V. Ramesh, president of the Place Names Society of India, &quot;Mangaluru&quot; was first used in 1345 CE during Vijayanagara rule. Many &quot;shilashasanas&quot; (stones) of the Vijayanagara period refer the city as &quot;Mangalapura&quot;. During the Alupa dynasty period, it was referred to as &quot;Mangalapura&quot; (&quot;Mangala&quot; means &#x27;auspicious&#x27;). In the Kannada language, the city is known as &quot;Mangaluru&quot;, a reference to Mangaladevi (the suffix &quot;uru&quot; means town or city). Mangalore was historically an important centre of Indian Ocean trade on the Malabar coast. Hence, it was also known by the name &quot;Manjalūr&quot; in Arabic. During British rule from 1799, the anglicised version &quot;Mangalore&quot; became the official appellation. According to historian George M. Moraes, however, the word &quot;Mangalore&quot; is the Portuguese corruption of &quot;Mangaluru&quot;. The city&#x27;s name appears on maps as far back as the 1652 Sanson Map of India.

Mangalore&#x27;s diverse communities have different names for the city in their languages. In Tulu, which is the region&#x27;s primary spoken language, the city is called &quot;Kudla&quot; (), meaning &quot;junction&quot; because it is situated at the confluence of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers. In Konkani, Mangalore is referred to as &quot;Kodiyal&quot; (), the Byari name for the city is &quot;Maikala&quot; (), and in Malayalam, the city is called &quot;Mangalapuram&quot; () meaning auspicious city (same mangala as the Kannada term). Mangalore was officially renamed &quot;Mangaluru&quot; by the Karnataka government on 1 November 2014.

==History==
===Early and medieval history===
Mangalore&#x27;s historical importance is highlighted by the many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder referred to a place called &quot;Nitrias&quot; and said it was an undesirable place for disembarkation because of the pirates who frequented its vicinity, while Greek second-century historian Ptolemy referenced a place named &quot;Nitra&quot;. These references were probably about an area with the Netravati River which flows through Mangalore. In his sixth-century work &quot;Christian Topography&quot;, Cosmas Indicopleustes (a Greek monk) mentions Malabar as being the chief seat of the pepper trade and &quot;Mangarouth&quot; (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper markets which exported pepper.

According to Kerala Muslim tradition, the Masjid Zeenath Baksh at Mangalore is one of the oldest mosques in Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 AD at Kodungallur with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who left from Dharmadom to Mecca and converted to Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to &quot;Qissat Shakarwati Farmad&quot;, the &quot;Masjids&quot; at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayani (Koyilandy), and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar; they are among the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in Indian Subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town. Three of them, Mangalore, Barkur, and Kasaragod, are in Tulu Nadu.

Mangalore is considered the heart of a distinct multi-linguistic cultural region, the homeland of the Tulu-speaking people. In the third century BCE, the town formed part of the Maurya Empire, which was ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha. From the third to the sixth century CE, the Kadamba dynasty, whose capital was based in Banavasi in North Canara, ruled over the entire Canara region as independent rulers. From the middle of the seventh century to the end of the 14th century, the South Canara region was ruled by its native Alupa rulers, who ruled over the region as feudatories of major regional dynasties like the Chalukyas of Badami, Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Kalyani, and Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra. An Old Malayalam inscription (part of the Ramanthali inscriptions which date to 1075 CE), mentions king Kunda Alupa, the ruler of Alupa dynasty of Mangalore. It can be found at Ezhimala (the former headquarters of Mushika dynasty) near Cannanore, in the North Malabar region of Kerala.

During the 1130s and 1140s, during the reign of the Alupa king Kavi Alupendra (1110–1160), the city was home to the Tunisian Jewish merchant Abraham Ben Yiju. The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mangalore in 1342, referred to it as &quot;Manjarur&quot; and stated the town was situated on a large estuary called the &quot;Estuary of the wolf&quot;, which was the greatest estuary in the country of Malabar. By 1345 the Vijayanagara rulers brought the region under their control.

During the Vijayanagara period (1345–1550), South Canara was divided into Mangalore and Barkur &quot;rajyas&quot; (provinces), and two governors were appointed to look after each of them from Mangalore and Barkur. Often a single governor ruled over both Mangalore and Barkur &quot;rajyas&quot;; when the authority passed to the Keladi rulers (1550–1763), they only had a governor at Barkur. In 1448 Abdur Razzaq who was the Persian ambassador of Sultan Shah Rukh of Samarkand, visited Mangalore &quot;en route&quot; to the Vijayanagara court. The Italian traveller Ludovico di Varthema, who visited India in 1506, said he saw nearly sixty ships laden with rice ready to sail from the port of Mangalore.

===Foundation and early modern history===

In 1498, European influence in Mangalore began when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at the nearby St Mary&#x27;s Islands, just after his arrival at Koyilandy, Kozhikode. The Portuguese acquired many commercial interests in Canara in the 16th century. Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained a friendly relationship with the Portuguese, whose trade slowly grew and they strove to destroy the coastal Arab and Mappila trade. In 1524, Vasco da Gama ordered the blockading of rivers after he heard the Muslim merchants of Kozhikode had agents at Mangalore and Basrur. In 1526, the Portuguese under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore. The coastal trade passed into Portuguese hands.

In 1550, the Vijayanagara ruler Sadashiva Raya entrusted to Sadashiv Nayaka of Keladi with administering the coastal region of Canara. By 1554, he established political authority over South Canara. The 16th century work &quot;Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen&quot; written by Zainuddin Makhdoom II appears to be the first historical work written in detail about the contemporary history of Mangalore. It is written in Arabic and contains pieces of information about the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonize Tulu Nadu and Malabar coast.

After the disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565, the rulers of Keladi attained greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region. They continued the Vijayanagara administrative system and the provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist. The governor of Mangalore also acted as the governor of the Keladi army in his province. The Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle visited here in 1623–1624. In 1695, Arabs burnt the town in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade.

In 1763, Hyder Ali, the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, conquered Mangalore, which was brought under his administration until 1767. Mangalore was ruled by the British East India Company from 1767 to 1783, but Hyder Ali&#x27;s son Tipu Sultan took it from their control in 1783 and renamed it &quot;Jalalabad&quot;. The Second Anglo–Mysore War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mangalore by Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company on 11 March 1784. After the defeat of Tipu at the Fourth Anglo–Mysore War, the city remained under British control. South Canara district was the headquarters under the Madras Presidency.

Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician who visited Mangalore in 1801, said the city was a prosperous port with plentiful trade. The main commodity of export was rice; it went to Muscat, Bombay, Goa, and Malabar. &quot;Supari&quot; (Betel-nut) was exported to Bombay, Surat, and Kutch. Sandalwood and black pepper were exported to Bombay.

Local capital was mainly invested in land and money lending, leading to the regional development of banking because the British colonial government did not support industrialisation there. After European missionaries arrived in the early 19th century, educational institutions and modern industries modelled on European ones were developed in the region. The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was an important step towards industrialisation. Missionaries set up printing presses, textile mills and factories that made Mangalore tiles. When Canara (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was split into North Canara and South Canara in 1859, Mangalore became the headquarters of South Canara, which remained under Madras Presidency while in 1862, North Canara was transferred to the Bombay Presidency.

===Later modern and contemporary history===
On 23 May 1866, a municipal council for Mangalore with responsibility for civic amenities and urban planning was mandated by the Madras Town Improvement Act (1865). The Italian Jesuits who arrived in the city in 1878, played an important role in the city&#x27;s education, economy, health, and social welfare. Mangalore was linked to the Southern Railway in 1907 and the subsequent proliferation of motor vehicles in India further increased trade and communication between the city and the rest of the country. Mangalore was a major source of educated workers to Bombay, Bangalore, and the Middle East by the early 20th century.

The States Reorganisation Act (1956) led to Mangalore being incorporated into the newly created Mysore State, which was later renamed Karnataka. Mangalore is the seventh-largest port of India, giving the state access to the Laccadive Sea coastline. Between 1970 and 1980, Mangalore experienced significant growth with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals &amp; Fertilizers Limited in 1976. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw Mangalore develop as a commercial and petrochemical hub.

<doc id="308299" wikidata="Q613458" url="?curid=308299" title="Raschig ring">
<text>A Raschig ring is a piece of tube, approximately equal in length and diameter, used in large numbers as a packed bed within columns for distillations and other chemical engineering processes. They are usually ceramic, metal, or glass and provide a large surface area within the volume of the column for interaction between liquid and gas vapours.

Raschig rings are named after their inventor, German chemist Friedrich Raschig, who patented them in 1914.

==Use==

They form what is known as random packing, and enabled Raschig to perform distillations of much greater efficiency than his competitors using fractional distillation columns with trays.

In a distillation column, the reflux or condensed vapour runs down the column, covering the surfaces of the rings, while vapour from the reboiler goes up the column. As the vapour and liquid pass each other countercurrently in a small space, they tend toward equilibrium. Thus, less-volatile material tends to go downward, and more-volatile material upward.

They are also used for devices where gas and liquid are put in contact for purposes of gas absorption, stripping, or chemical reaction, and as a support for biofilms in biological reactors.

Raschig rings made from borosilicate glass are sometimes employed in the handling of nuclear materials. They are used inside vessels and tanks containing solutions of fissile material, for example solutions of enriched uranyl nitrate. There they act as neutron absorbers to prevent a criticality accident.

==Developments==
Given the success of the Raschig ring, there have been other forms developed to either improve upon it, or to avoid patents for particular designs.

The Pall-Ring, commonly spelled as Pall ring, developed by Wilhelm Pfannmüller of BASF during the WWII, attempts to increase the useful aspects of packing, by giving an increased number of edges to disrupt flow, while also reducing the volume taken up by the ring packing medium itself. Rather than using a solid-walled tube, the Pall ring resembles an open basket structure of thin bars. These form both a tube and also a radial structure of cross bars. Pall rings may be injection moulded of plastics, moulded of ceramics or press-formed from metal sheet.

The Raschig Super Ring represents a further development of the same concepts behind the Pall ring. It optimises the production of turbulent film-type flows and prevents the formation of drops. The &#x27;rings&#x27; no longer resemble rings but are pressed from metal sheet in the form of wave shapes of narrow strips. Super rings appeared in 1995 and have been developed through several improved generations since.

The Bialecki ring, developed by the same Pfanmüller as the Pall-Ring and first patented by him in 1944, is mistakenly named after the Polish chemical engineer from Kraków Zbigniew Białecki. Like the Pall rings, they are an improved version of Raschig rings. The rings may be injection moulded of plastics or press-formed from metal sheet without welding. Specific surface area of filling ranges between 60 and 440 m2/m3. Advantages of Białecki rings include:
* Two or three times lower fluid flow resistance than Raschig rings,
* Two or three times higher bandwidth,
* Disperse the liquid evenly over the entire cross-section of the column, regardless of the method of supply, even with point-type liquid supply,
* Liquid retention (&quot;hold-up&quot;) in relation to other fillings is negligible - the liquid flows down quickly after the column stops working,
* Resolving power at a constant level regardless of column load,
* The mass transfer coefficient increases with the size of the ring dimensions, unlike the other fillings used so far,
* Minimal overgrow (do not cover with sediment),
* A rigid construction, which allows weight reduction of up to 20% compared to other filling rings.

<text>Owens Valley (Mono: &quot;Payahǖǖnadǖ&quot;, meaning &quot;place of flowing water&quot;) is an arid valley of the Owens River in eastern California in the United States. It is located to the east of the Sierra Nevada, west of the White Mountains and Inyo Mountains, and is split between the Great Basin Desert and the Mojave Desert. The mountain peaks on the West side (including Mount Whitney) reach above in elevation, while the floor of the Owens Valley is about , making the valley the deepest in the United States. The Sierra Nevada casts the valley in a rain shadow, which makes Owens Valley &quot;the Land of Little Rain&quot;. The bed of Owens Lake, now a predominantly dry endorheic alkali flat, sits on the southern end of the valley.

The current arid nature of the valley is mostly due to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power diverting the water of the region. The valley provides water to the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the source of one-third of the water for city, and was the area at the center of one of the fiercest and longest-running episodes of the California Water Wars. Owens Lake was completely emptied by 1926, only 13 years after Los Angeles began diverting water. The water diversions inspired aspects of the 1974 film &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

Towns in the Owens Valley include Bishop, Lone Pine, Independence and Big Pine; about 25,000 people live in the valley. The major road in the Owens Valley is U.S. Route 395.

== Geology ==

About three million years ago, the Sierra Nevada Fault and the White Mountains Fault systems became active with repeated episodes of slip earthquakes gradually producing the impressive relief of the eastern Sierra Nevada and White Mountain escarpments that bound the northern Owens Valley-Mono Basin region.

Owens Valley is a graben—a down-dropped block of land between two vertical faults—the westernmost in the Basin and Range Province. It is also part of a trough which extends from Oregon to Death Valley called the Walker Lane.

The western flank of much of the valley has large moraines coming off the Sierra Nevada. These unsorted piles of rock, boulders, and dust were pushed to where they are by glaciers during the last ice age. An excellent example of a moraine is on State Route 168 as it climbs into Buttermilk Country.

This graben was formed by a long series of earthquakes, such as the 1872 Lone Pine earthquake, that have moved the graben down and helped move the Sierra Nevada up. The graben is much larger than the depth of the valley suggests; gravity studies suggest that of sedimentary rock mostly fills the graben and that a very steep escarpment is buried under the western length of the valley. The topmost part of this escarpment is exposed at Alabama Hills.

The Owens Valley has many mini-volcanoes, such as Crater Mountain in the Big Pine volcanic field. Smaller versions of the Devils Postpile, can be found, for example, by Little Lake.

==Ecology==
The valley is split between four different ecoregions, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency: &quot;Upper Owens Valley&quot; and &quot;Tonopah Sagebrush Foothills&quot; (as part of the Great Basin Desert), and &quot;Western Mojave Basins&quot; and &quot;Mojave Playas&quot; (as part of the Mojave Desert).

The floor of the valley, roughly north of the town of Independence, California, lies in the &quot;Upper Owens Valley&quot; ecoregion. The ecoregion also includes the distinct Alabama Hills in the far south. The primary landforms of this ecoregion are gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and mostly level basin floors, terraces, and floodplains. Elevations range from about along the Owens River in the south to more than where the higher fans descend from adjacent mountains. Alluvium from the Quaternary period covers the region, with some small areas of lava flows. Shrub-covered rangeland is the dominant land cover, with minor areas of hay and pastureland. Vegetation includes big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, spiny hopsage, antelope bitterbrush, saltbush, ephedra, and several perennial grasses including desert needlegrass. Along the Owens River, some restoration of cottonwoods, willows, and wetlands has occurred.

The eastern slopes of the valley lie in the &quot;Tonopah Sagebrush Foothills&quot; ecoregion. The soil is rocky and lacks the fine sediments found at lower elevations of the Tonopah Basin. Great Basin species are common in this ecoregion. However, because the ecoregion is in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, and is adjacent to the Mojave Desert, the aridity leads to black sagebrush being common and the more mesic understory species being largely absent. Other Mojave Desert species, such as blackbrush, Joshua tree, and cholla cactus are common where summer moisture is more prevalent. Streams are ephemeral and flow during and immediately after storms. Storm events can be of sufficient magnitude to move large quantities of sediment in streambeds Because of the arid conditions, this ecoregion has low carrying capacity for cattle.

The southern part of the valley, except for the bed of Owens Lake, lies in the &quot;Western Mojave Basins&quot; ecoregion. The ecoregion is typically dominated
by creosotebush and white bursage, with areas of shadscale, fourwing saltbush, and on some upper bajadas and fans, scattered Joshua trees. This ecoregion has little summer rainfall compared to the basins in the eastern Mojave Desert, and typically lacks species such as Mojave yucca and big galleta.
The lakebed of Owens Lake is considered to be a &quot;Mojave Playa&quot;. The high salt and clay content of playa surface mud, and the hot, dry conditions inhibit plant growth. This ecoregion is largely barren and only sparse saltbush vegetation typically is found on the margins. Playas are dynamic environments with surface channels, playa margins, alluvial materials, and biota changing with each flooding event. Physical and biological crusts on soil surfaces are important, stabilizing soil and reducing erosion from wind and water.

The valley contains plants adapted to alkali flat habitat. One of these, the Owens Valley checkerbloom (&quot;Sidalcea covillei&quot;), is endemic to Owens Valley.
Tule elk were introduced into the Owens Valley by the State of California in 1933. From the original 56 introduced elk, the herd grew to 300 individuals by 1952, which precipitated conflicts with ranchers due to destruction of property by the elk. Currently, the total elk population is managed to be approximately 490.

== History ==

The valley was inhabited in late prehistoric times by the Timbisha (also called Panamint or Koso) in the extreme south end around Owens Lake and by the Mono tribe (also called Owens Valley Paiute) in the central and northern portions of the valley. The Timbisha speak the Timbisha language, classified in the Numic branch of Uto-Aztecan language family. The closest related languages are Shoshoni and Comanche. The Eastern Mono speak a dialect of the Mono language, which is also Numic but is more closely related to Northern Paiute. The Timbisha presently live in Death Valley at Furnace Creek although most families also have summer homes in the Lone Pine colony. The Eastern Mono live in several colonies from Lone Pine to Bishop. They lived along the rivers and creeks which were fed by snowmelt from the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Trade between Native Americans of the Owens Valley and coastal tribes such as the Chumash has been indicated by the archaeological record.

On May 1, 1834, Joseph R. Walker entered Owens Valley from the south, having crossed the Sierra Nevada at Walker Pass. Walker and his group of 52 men traveled up the valley on their way back to the Humboldt Sink, and back up the Humboldt River to the Rocky Mountains.

In 1845, John C. Fremont named the Owens valley, river, and lake for Richard Owens, one of his guides. Camp Independence was established on Oak Creek near modern Independence, on July 4, 1862, during the Owens Valley Indian War.
From 1942 to 1945, during World War II, the first Japanese American Internment camp operated in the valley at Manzanar near Independence.

=== Water diversion to Los Angeles ===

In the early 20th century, the valley became the scene of a struggle between local residents and the city of Los Angeles over water rights. William Mulholland, superintendent of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), planned the Los Angeles Aqueduct, completed in 1913, which diverted water from the Owens River. The water rights were acquired deceitfully, often splitting water cooperatives and pitting neighbors against one another. In 1924, local farmers were fed up with the purchases and erupted in violence, sabotaging parts of the water system.

Eventually, Los Angeles acquired a large portion of the water rights to over of land in the valley, almost completely diverting the water inflows away from Owens Lake. Gary Libecap of the University of California, Santa Barbara, observed that the price Los Angeles was willing to pay to other water sources per volume of water was far higher than what the farmers received. Farmers who resisted the pressure from Los Angeles until 1930 received the highest price for their land; most farmers sold their land from 1905 to 1925, and received less than Los Angeles was willing to pay. The sale of their land brought the farmers substantially more income than if they had kept the land for farming and ranching. None of the sales were made under threat of eminent domain. As a result of these acquisitions, the lake subsequently dried up completely, leaving the present alkali flat which plagues the southern valley with alkali dust storms.

In 1970, LADWP completed a second aqueduct from Owens Valley. More surface water was diverted, and groundwater was pumped to feed the aqueduct. Owens Valley springs and seeps dried and disappeared, and groundwater-dependent vegetation began to die.

Years of litigation followed. In 1997, Inyo County, Los Angeles, the Owens Valley Committee, the Sierra Club, and other concerned parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding that specified terms by which the lower Owens River would be rewatered by June 2003. LADWP missed this deadline and was sued again. Under another settlement, this time including the State of California, Los Angeles promised to rewater the lower Owens River by September 2005. In July 2004, Los Angeles mayor James Hahn proposed barring all future development on its Owens Valley holdings by proposing a conservation easement for all LADWP land. They did not meet this extended deadline. In 2008, Los Angeles fulfilled its promise and rewatered the lower Owens River.

Pursuant to a 2014 agreement between the city and Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District (GBUAPCD, the Owens Valley air quality regulators), LADWP began using a new method of suppressing airborne dust from the dry bed of Owens Lake. In 2022, the GBUAPCD issued an order and subsequently fined the Los Angeles utility for ignoring an order to control dust on a of dry lake bed. The LADWP responded with a lawsuit, accusing the air district of exceeding its authority and ordering dust control measures without first conducting an environmental analysis of its impacts, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act. A California Superior Court ruled that the 2014 agreement doesn&#x27;t cover the dispute and the fines levied by GBUAPCD are unenforceable.

<doc id="308312" wikidata="Q1085532" url="?curid=308312" title="Violin Concerto in A minor (Bach)">
<text>The Violin Concerto in A minor, BWV 1041, is a violin concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. It shows the influence of Italian composers such as Bach&#x27;s older contemporary Vivaldi.

Bach is known to have studied Vivaldi&#x27;s music from around 1714 when he was working at Weimar. Italian influence can be seen in keyboard music he composed around that time. However, the date of the concerto is the subject of dispute as the original score has not survived. It could have been written at any of three locations:
*Weimar. Most scholars think it was written after Bach left Weimar in 1717 (the violinist , who suggests it was written there, adheres to the minority position). 
*Köthen. It is &quot;generally thought to have been composed at Köthen&quot;. Bach worked at the court there in the period 1717–23 and his duties included directing a small orchestra.
*Leipzig. It could have been written at Leipzig, as the only autograph source to survive is a set of parts Bach copied out (along with Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Johann Ludwig Krebs, and an unknown copyist) in Leipzig from a now lost score or draft. Christoph Wolff has argued that the work may have been written during Bach&#x27;s time as director of Leipzig&#x27;s Collegium Musicum. John Butt takes a similar view, suggesting that Bach wrote it &quot;probably soon after taking over the Leipzig Collegium Musicum in 1729&quot;. 

==Structure and analysis==
The piece has three movements:

A typical performance of the concerto takes around 15 minutes.

==Publication==
The concerto was published for the first time in 1852. In the 1870s Wilhelm Rust edited it for publication in the first complete edition of Bach&#x27;s works.

==Instrumentations and transcriptions==
The Keyboard Concerto in G minor, BWV 1058 is an arrangement of this concerto with harpsichord.

<text>The Violin Concerto in E major, BWV 1042, is a violin concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach. It is based on the three-movement Venetian concerto model, albeit with a few unusual features; each movement has &quot;un-Italian characteristics&quot;. 

The piece has three movements:

#Allegro, meter of , in ritornello form in E major
#Adagio, meter of , with a ground bass in C-sharp minor
#Allegro assai, meter of , with an overall structure of a rondo in E major

While there are two 18th-century scores, neither is autographed; however, Bach re-used the concerto as the model for his Harpsichord Concerto in D major, BWV 1054, found in his 1737–39 autographed manuscript of these works. The concerto is thought to have been written when Bach was working for the court of Köthen or when Bach was in Leipzig.

<text>Fawn McKay Brodie (September 15, 1915 – January 10, 1981) was an American biographer and one of the first female professors of history at UCLA. She is best known for &quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot; (1974), a work of psychobiography, and &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; (1945), an early biography of Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.

Raised in Utah in a respected, if impoverished, family who were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Fawn McKay drifted away from Mormonism during her years of graduate work at the University of Chicago and married Bernard Brodie, an academic who became a national defense expert; they had three children. Although Fawn Brodie eventually became one of the first tenured female professors of history at UCLA, she is best known for her five biographies, four of which incorporate insights from Freudian psychology.

Brodie&#x27;s depiction of Joseph Smith in 1945 as a fraudulent &quot;genius of improvisation&quot; has been described as both a &quot;beautifully written biography ... the work of a mature scholar [that] represented the first genuine effort to come to grips with the contradictory evidence about Smith&#x27;s early life&quot; and as a work that presented conjecture as fact. Her best-selling psychobiography of Thomas Jefferson, published in 1974, was the first modern examination of evidence that Jefferson had taken his slave Sally Hemings as a concubine and fathered children by her. Brodie concluded he had done so, a conclusion supported by a 1998 DNA analysis and current scholarly consensus.

==Early life==
Fawn McKay was the second of five children of Thomas E. McKay and Fawn Brimhall. Born in Ogden, Utah, she grew up in Huntsville, about ten miles (16 km) east. Both her parents descended from families influential in early Mormonism. Her maternal grandfather, George H. Brimhall, was president of Brigham Young University. Her father, Thomas Evans McKay, was a bishop, president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Swiss-Austrian Mission, and an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Brodie&#x27;s paternal uncle, David O. McKay, was an LDS Church apostle when Brodie was born and later became the church&#x27;s ninth president.

Despite the prominence of her family in the church, they lived in genteel poverty, their property burdened by unpayable debt. The young Fawn was perpetually embarrassed that their house did not have indoor plumbing.

Brodie early demonstrated precociousness. At three she memorized and recited lengthy poems. When a whooping cough epidemic convinced Brodie&#x27;s mother to homeschool Fawn&#x27;s sister, Flora, who was two years older, Fawn more than kept pace. Introduced to school in 1921, the six-year-old Fawn was advanced to the fourth grade; when she lost the school spelling bee to a twelve-year-old, &quot;she cried and cried that this bright boy, twice her age, had spelled her down.&quot; At ten she had a poem printed in the LDS youth periodical, &quot;The Juvenile Instructor&quot;; at fourteen she was salutatorian of Weber High School.

Although Brodie grew to maturity in a rigorously religious environment that included strict Sabbatarianism and evening prayers on her knees, her mother was a closet skeptic who thought the LDS Church was a &quot;wonderful social order&quot; but who doubted its dogma. According to Brodie, in the late 1930s, while her father headed Mormon mission activities in German-speaking Europe, her mother became a &quot;thoroughgoing heretic&quot; while accompanying him there.

==Education and marriage==
From 1930 to 1932, Brodie attended Weber College, a two-year institution in Ogden, then owned by the LDS Church, where she became an accomplished public speaker and participated in intercollegiate debate. She completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature at the University of Utah in 1934. There she began to question core Mormon beliefs, such as that the Native Americans had originated in ancient Palestine. After graduation at age nineteen, she returned to teach English at Weber College.

In high school, Brodie had begun dating a classmate, Dilworth Jensen. They wrote to each other faithfully during Jensen&#x27;s long absence on an LDS mission in Europe. In June 1935, they were both accepted for graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and friends assumed they would marry. Her sister, Flora, had recently eloped with Jensen&#x27;s brother, whom the McKays disliked. They encouraged Fawn to attend the University of Chicago rather than marry. She seemed to have had &quot;growing doubts about marrying&quot; Jensen.

At the University of Chicago, where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in English in 1936, she lost her faith in religion entirely. In 1975, she recalled, &quot;It was like taking a hot coat off in the summertime. The sense of liberation I had at the University of Chicago was exhilarating. I felt very quickly that I could not go back to the old life, and I never did.&quot; She continued to write to Jensen until shortly before she married Bernard Brodie on her graduation day, August 28, 1936.

Brodie was a native of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish immigrants, who was alienated from both his family and his family&#x27;s religion. A bright graduate student in international relations, he eventually became a noted expert in military strategy during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter&#x27;s impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family&#x27;s strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn&#x27;s mother attended. None of Brodie&#x27;s family did.

==&quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;==
===Composition===
Having found temporary employment at the Harper Library of the University of Chicago, Brodie began researching the origins of the Book of Mormon. By mid-1939, she confided to her uncle, Dean R. Brimhall (another ex-Mormon), that she intended to write a scholarly biography of Joseph Smith. Progress toward that goal was slowed by the birth of the Brodies&#x27; first child and by three rapid moves, a consequence of her husband&#x27;s search for a permanent position. In 1943, Fawn Brodie was encouraged enough by her progress to enter her 300-page draft in a contest for the Alfred A. Knopf literary fellowship. In May, her application was judged the best of the 44 entries.

Brodie continued her research at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where the Brodies had moved for her husband&#x27;s work, as well as at the headquarters of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Independence, Missouri. Eventually she returned to Utah, where she did research in the LDS Church Archives. She gained access to some highly restricted materials by claiming to be &quot;Brother McKay&#x27;s daughter&quot;, a subterfuge that made her feel &quot;guilty as hell&quot;. Her pursuit of little-known documents eventually attracted the attention of her uncle, David O. McKay. After a &quot;painful, acrimonious encounter&quot; with her uncle, Brodie promised never again to consult materials in the church&#x27;s archives.

Brodie&#x27;s research was enlarged by other students of Mormonism, most notably Dale L. Morgan, who became a lifelong friend, mentor, and sounding board. Brodie completed her biography of Joseph Smith in 1944, and it was published in 1945 by Alfred A. Knopf, when she was thirty years old.

===Thesis===
Its title, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;, alludes to a comment Joseph Smith made in a speech shortly before his death in 1844. Brodie presents the young Joseph as a lazy, good-natured, extroverted, and unsuccessful treasure seeker. In an attempt to improve his family&#x27;s fortunes, he developed the notion of golden plates and then the concept of a religious novel, the Book of Mormon, based in part on &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot;, an earlier work by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith. Brodie asserts that at first Smith was a deliberate impostor; but at some point, in nearly untraceable steps, he became convinced that he really was a prophet, though never escaping &quot;the memory of the conscious artifice&quot; that created the Book of Mormon.

===Reviews===
Non-Mormon reviewers praised either the author&#x27;s research, the excellence of her literary style, or both. &quot;Newsweek&quot; called Brodie&#x27;s book &quot;a definitive biography in the finest sense of the word&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; praised the author for her &quot;skill and scholarship and admirable detachment&quot;. Other reviews were less positive. Brodie was especially annoyed by the review of novelist Vardis Fisher, who accused her of stating &quot;as indisputable facts what can only be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence&quot;. Bernard DeVoto wrote a mixed review, but he praised the biography as &quot;the best book about the Mormons so far published&quot;. DeVoto, who believed Joseph Smith was &quot;paranoid&quot;, said that Brodie had not provided adequate psychological explanations for Smith&#x27;s behavior. Brodie also came to believe that a thorough psychological analysis of Smith was essential and that she &quot;hadn&#x27;t gone far enough in this direction&quot;.

===Reaction of the LDS Church===
Although &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; criticized many foundational Mormon beliefs about Joseph Smith, the LDS Church was slow to condemn the work, even as the book went into a second printing. In 1946, &quot;The Improvement Era&quot;, an official periodical of the church, said that many of the book&#x27;s citations were from &quot;doubtful sources&quot; and that the biography was &quot;of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith&quot;. The &quot;Church News&quot; section of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; had a lengthy critique: it praised the biography&#x27;s &quot;fine literary style&quot; and denounced it as &quot;a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before&quot;. In the booklet, &quot;No, Ma&#x27;am, That&#x27;s Not History&quot;, Hugh Nibley, a BYU professor and LDS historian, challenged Brodie. He asserted that she had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie described the &quot;Deseret News&quot; pamphlet as &quot;a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda&quot;, but she dismissed the more popular &quot;No, Ma&#x27;am, That&#x27;s Not History&quot; as &quot;a flippant and shallow piece&quot;.

In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She never tried to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she suffered from her disillusionment with Mormonism &quot;had to do with the pain I caused my family. The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience.&quot; Before &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, &quot;You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, and the fact that we come out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you.&quot; Brodie&#x27;s mother and three sisters were enthusiastic about the book, but Thomas McKay refused to read it.

==Critical success with psychobiography==

===&quot;Thaddeus Stevens: Scourge of the South&quot;===
Fawn Brodie genuinely enjoyed her roles as wife and mother, believing that rearing children, especially when they were small, was &quot;enormously fulfilling&quot;. Eventually the Brodies had two boys and a girl. Still, Brodie was not content to be without a writing project for long. After some desultory investigation of other possibilities, she settled on a biography of Thaddeus Stevens, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania during the Civil War and the Reconstruction era.

Brodie believed that previous historians had unduly vilified Stevens, and she relished the prospect of rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens as a champion of black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie also wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by having a club foot.

In the view of students of historiography such as Ernst Breisach, all biographers are to some degree psychohistorians, and any biography that refused to examine motives, character traits, and the depth of personality would be flat and uninteresting. Brodie became interested in applying the theories of professional psychoanalysts to the study of historical personalities, a subject especially popular during the mid-twentieth century. At first Brodie was amused at how much psychoanalysis had &quot;become a religion&quot; to its practitioners, but she later became a committed devotee of psychoanalytic theory. Brodie made a number of acquaintances among psychoanalysts who helped her evaluate Thaddeus Stevens, notably Ralph R. Greenson, with whom she developed a close personal and professional relationship. Both the Brodies also undertook psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard&#x27;s employer, the RAND Corporation, paid most of the bills.) Brodie&#x27;s interest in psychology during this period was heightened by family problems: her mother attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix, and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.

The Stevens biography took the better part of a decade to complete.

====Reviews====
When Brodie published the Stevens book in 1959, it enjoyed virtually unanimous praise from critics. Major historians of the Civil War and Reconstruction era, including David Herbert Donald and C. Vann Woodward, praised the biography. Donald called Brodie&#x27;s psychoanalysis of Stevens &quot;a tour de force&quot;. Most gracious was Richard N. Current, who had written a less favorable account of Stevens, which Brodie had earlier criticized. Current not only urged W. W. Norton to publish a paperback edition of Brodie&#x27;s book, but wrote a blurb praising the author for writing &quot;more imaginatively&quot; and &quot;more resourcefully...than any other Stevens biographer&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;Thaddeus Stevens&quot; was a commercial failure that sold fewer than fifteen hundred copies before going out of print in less than a year.

==Other work==
In 1960 the Brodies spent a year in France, during which Fawn spent considerable energy researching and writing &quot;From Crossbow to H-Bomb&quot;, a co-authored paperback intended as a college text. It treated the influence of science on military technology. Bernard Brodie had signed the contract with Random House, but his wife did most of the research and writing.

===&quot;The Devil Drives: A Life of Sir Richard Burton&quot;===
When the family returned to California, Alfred Knopf asked Brodie to edit and write a new introduction for Sir Richard Francis Burton&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The City of the Saints and Across the Rocky Mountains to California&quot; (1862). Almost immediately she &quot;was lost&quot; to Burton, a man whom she described as &quot;fascinating beyond belief&quot;. She soon planned a full biography. Like Brodie, Burton was an agnostic who was fascinated by religion and all things sexual. Brodie consulted with the psychoanalyst community and used her own free association to explore Burton&#x27;s subconscious. For instance, she noted that immediately before and after Burton wrote about his mother, he talked &quot;about cheating, decapitation, mutilations, smashings—all the stories and metaphors are violent, negative, and hostile&quot;.

====Reviews====
&quot;The Devil Drives: A Life of Sir Richard Burton&quot; was published in May 1967 and was chosen as a featured selection by both the Literary Guild Book Club and the History Book Club. Reviews were again generally positive. The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; promoted it as an &quot;[e]xcellent biography of a bizarre man who had a bizarre wife—and life&quot;.

===Professorship at UCLA===
The publication of three acclaimed biographies allowed Brodie to become a part-time lecturer in history at the University of California, Los Angeles although she had not earned a Ph.D. (Both her bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees were in English.) As a woman, Brodie met some resistance from the large and overwhelmingly male history faculty, but her specialty in the current field of psychohistory aided her original appointment and her eventual promotion to full professor. Brodie taught both larger upper-division lectures in American history and small seminars on American political biography, preferring the latter.

==&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;==
Thomas Jefferson was a natural subject for Brodie&#x27;s fourth biography. One of her courses focused on the United States from 1800 to 1830, and her seminar in political biography could serve as an appropriate forum for a work-in-progress. Throughout this period, Brodie was attracted to Mormon studies and was importuned by several publishers to write a biography of Brigham Young. The LDS entrepreneur, O.C. Tanner (1904–1993), offered Brodie $10,000 in advance to produce a manuscript. But Dale Morgan told Brodie that Madeline Reeder McQuown, a close friend, had nearly completed a huge manuscript on Young. In fact, McQuown&#x27;s biography was little more than a few rough drafts of early chapters, but Brodie was dissuaded and abandoned Young for Thomas Jefferson.

By May 1968, Brodie was committed to writing the Jefferson biography. She understood that it could not be a full account. The study of Jefferson had become a virtual career for several living historians. For instance, Dumas Malone was in the process of completing a six-volume biography of Jefferson, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975. Brodie decided to concentrate on a biography of &quot;the private man&quot;. She decided to build on several recently published articles on the historical controversy describing a reported sexual relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings, a quadroon slave said to be the half-sister of his late wife. The topic was timely during a period of increased national interest in race, sex, and presidential hypocrisy. Brodie had personal reasons as well, having discovered that her husband had been conducting an extramarital affair.

To Brodie, Jefferson&#x27;s ambiguous posturings on slavery could be explained by his personal life. If he had been conducting a 38-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves. Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren, who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about this alleged sexual relationship, including by Madison Hemings in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father and said he had a long relationship with his mother. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist James T. Callender when Jefferson was President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.

Working from Winthrop Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Black on White&quot; (1968), Brodie also used Dumas Malone&#x27;s documentation of Jefferson&#x27;s activities to correlate his stays at Monticello with the conception period of each of Sally Hemings&#x27; children, whose births he recorded in the Farm Book. She discovered that Hemings never conceived when Jefferson was not at Monticello, during years when he was often away for months at a time.

===Reviews===
By 1971 Brodie had a $15,000 advance from her publisher and had presented a summary of her arguments at the annual meeting of the Organization of American Historians. The Jefferson biographer Merrill Peterson pilloried the paper. She also wrote an article for &quot;American Heritage&quot; of her work in progress, entitled &quot;The Great Jefferson Taboo&quot;, about her conclusion that the Jefferson–Hemings relationship took place. In a change from its usual practice, the magazine included all her notes to show the sources of her conclusions.

Brodie and her publisher understood that the biography would be controversial. An in-house editor at W. W. Norton was critical: &quot;Doesn&#x27;t [Brodie] know about making the theory fit the facts instead of trying to explain the facts to fit the theory? It&#x27;s pretty fascinating, like working out a detective story, but she doesn&#x27;t play fair.&quot;

&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot; was published in February 1974, and it was the main spring selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. Brodie tried to ensure that none of the three foremost Jefferson scholars, Dumas Malone, Merrill Peterson, and Julian Boyd, would review the book. Brodie was interviewed on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show,&quot; and the book quickly &quot;became a topic of comment in elite social-literary circles&quot;, as well as among political people. The biography was an immediate commercial success; it was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for thirteen weeks. &quot;Jefferson&quot; sold 80,000 copies in hardback and 270,000 copies in paperback, and netted Brodie $350,000 in royalties—adjusted for inflation, more than a million dollars in the early twenty-first century. Peterson concluded in 1998 that &quot;[n]o book of the last quarter century has left a more indelible mark on the Jefferson image&quot; than Brodie&#x27;s &quot;An Intimate History&quot;.

Literary reviews were generally positive, while historians were often critical of Brodie&#x27;s speculations. Mainstream historians had long denied the possibility of Jefferson&#x27;s relation with Sally Hemings, although such interracial liaisons were so common that by the late eighteenth century, visitors remarked on the numerous white slaves in Virginia and the Upper South. &quot;&quot;The Richmond Examiner&quot; on September 25, 1802, in a rare admission, stated that &quot;thousands&quot; of mulatto children were then being born in the South.&quot; Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble, educated women of the planter elite, also wrote about many interracial families in the era shortly before the American Civil War.

Like many previous Jefferson biographers, Brodie developed an intense affection for her protagonist. She claimed that in dreams, she and Jefferson became &quot;man and wife&quot;. Bernard Brodie is supposed to have muttered, &quot;God, I&#x27;m glad that man is out of the house.&quot; Fawn Brodie wondered where one could go after Jefferson, &quot;but down&quot;.

After her book was published, Brodie was contacted by some Eston Hemings Jefferson descendants who recognized his name from her account. His descendants had married white, and this generation appeared to be white. They discovered that their fathers in the 1940s had decided that, to protect their children from racial discrimination associated with descent from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, they would tell the children they were descended from Jefferson&#x27;s uncle. All these Jefferson descendants learned in the 1970s of their alleged descent from Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. Brodie wrote a follow-up article about the Jefferson-Hemings grandchildren in 1976, entitled &quot;Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Unknown Grandchildren: A Study in Historical Silences&quot;, published in October 1976 in &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine. Photographs and other documentary material they gave her have been donated to UCLA archives.

===1998 Jefferson DNA study and new consensus===

In 1997 Annette Gordon-Reed published &quot;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,&quot; in which she analyzed the historiography and noted the bias of historians in assessing conflicting accounts by descendants of the Jefferson family and the Hemings family, as well as evidence that they overlooked. She also noted Malone&#x27;s data, which established that Jefferson was at Monticello during the conception period for each of Sally Heming&#x27;s children.

To try to resolve the renewed controversy with modern techniques, in 1998 a Y-DNA study was conducted of descendants of the Jefferson male line, Eston Hemings (the youngest son of Sally Hemings), the Carr nephews, and Thomas Woodson (whose family also claimed descent from Jefferson). It found that the Y-DNA of the Eston Hemings descendant matched the rare haplotype of the male Jefferson line. In addition, the tests conclusively found that there was no match between the Carr line and the Hemings descendant.

In January 2000, a research committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which operates Monticello, concluded that there was a high probability that Jefferson had been the father of Eston Hemings and likely of all Hemings children listed in the Monticello records. Since then the Foundation has revised exhibits and tour commentary to reflect Jefferson&#x27;s paternity of all Hemings&#x27; children, and it has sponsored new research into the interracial society of Monticello and Charlottesville. Since 2000, most academics, including biographers such as Joseph Ellis, have agreed with the new consensus.

Other historians, including those associated with the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, founded after the DNA study, continue to disagree.

==&quot;Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character&quot;==
Brodie considered a range of subjects for a new biography. Brigham Young was a clear field, but she decided not to &quot;return to old ground&quot;. Richard Nixon had resigned the presidency shortly after she had finished &quot;Jefferson,&quot; and Brodie had spoken formally to both students and others about the former president. As a liberal Democrat, Brodie had developed a &quot;repellent fascination&quot; with Nixon, a man whom she called &quot;a rattlesnake&quot;, a &quot;plain damn liar&quot;, and a &quot;shabby, pathetic felon&quot;. Although Brodie thought Nixon was an imposter like Joseph Smith, she did not believe him to be the &quot;charming imposter the Mormon leader was&quot;.

Her interest in the former president had a personal basis as well. One of her sons had nearly been drafted in 1969 shortly after Nixon had won election on the promise to end the Vietnam War. (At the last minute, sympathetic physicians had reclassified Bruce Brodie as unfit for military service on the basis of his allergies.)

Also, when Nixon had sought information to discredit Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers, his operatives had burglarized the office of Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding. Ellsberg was a close friend and former RAND associate of Bernard Brodie. Fielding was Fawn Brodie&#x27;s long-time therapist. Brodie considered &quot;Nixon the perpetrator of an assault on her privacy&quot;.

Although neither Bernard nor her publisher was enthusiastic about her choice, Brodie began to work on her new project. She resigned her professorship at UCLA in 1977 to devote herself to research, including, for the first time, in oral history collections. Brodie conducted 150 interviews. She tried unsuccessfully to interview Henry Kissinger—whom she knew on a first-name basis—and Nixon for what she described in a letter to him as &quot;a compassionate and accurate study&quot;. (Nixon did not reply.) Although she could find no evidence, Brodie began to think that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship with his good friend Bebe Rebozo. Her psychoanalyst friends tried to warn her off this topic.

===Illness===
In November 1977, Bernard Brodie was diagnosed with a serious cancer, and Fawn Brodie suspended her research on Nixon: &quot;That son of a bitch can wait.&quot; She nursed her husband until his death a year later. Afterward, she struggled with &quot;a depression from which she would never really emerge&quot;. Under the circumstances, Nixon&#x27;s biography seemed &quot;like a total obscenity&quot;.

While hiking at a family reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study. Her three children and a daughter-in-law provided moral and editorial support. Knowing that she could never complete a full biography, Brodie ended the manuscript with Nixon&#x27;s pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.

===Reviews===
&quot;Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character&quot; was published in late 1981 and received reviews less enthusiastic than for any of her earlier books. Writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Godfrey Hodgson questioned both her psychoanalytic approach and her motives: &quot;[W]e are in danger of having the insights of psychotherapy used as a tool for character destruction, certainly for libel, potentially for revenge.&quot; According to J. Philipp Rosenberg, Brodie&#x27;s study of Richard Nixon&#x27;s early career demonstrated a weakness of psychobiography because it was written by an author who disliked her subject.

Sales of the book were disappointing, in part because of the reviews, and in part because memoirs by Nixon associates such as Henry Kissinger, John Ehrlichman, and John Dean had recently flooded the market. Perhaps Brodie&#x27;s book was most influential in stimulating Oliver Stone to create his controversial 1995 movie &quot;Nixon&quot;.

==Death==
Brodie died nine months before publication of &quot;Richard Nixon: The Shaping of His Character&quot;. As death neared, the cancer spread to her brain and bones, and Brodie suffered intense pain. During this period, she was visited in the hospital by her brother Thomas, who had remained a practicing Latter-day Saint. Brodie asked him to &quot;give me a blessing&quot;, although she had long been estranged from both her brother and the LDS Church. A few days later, Brodie released a note saying that her request for a priesthood blessing should not be misinterpreted as a request to return to the church. It was Brodie&#x27;s last signed statement. In accordance with her wishes, friends spread her ashes over the Santa Monica Mountains, which she loved and had successfully helped to protect from real estate development.

<doc id="308330" wikidata="Q6633418" url="?curid=308330" title="List of individual pigs">
<text>This is a list of notable pigs.

==General==

===Arnold===
Arnold was the Ziffels&#x27; pet pig on the TV sitcom &quot;Green Acres&quot;. He performed anthropomorphic activities such as coming uninvited into the Douglas home, turning on the television, and sitting in a chair to watch it.

===Khanzir===

Khanzir is a male pig who, in May 2009, attracted international attention as the &quot;only pig in Afghanistan&quot;.

===King Neptune===

King Neptune (May 16, 1942 – May 14, 1950) was a Hereford swine used by a United States Navy recruiter to raise $19 million in war bonds for the construction of between 1942 and 1946. At least two monuments have been erected in honor of this pig and his handlers.

===Learned pig===

In 1784-85 an unnamed pig was exhibited in London under the title The Learned Pig. The pig was said to be able to spell words and solve arithmetical problems. Other pigs were later exhibited in a similar way, under the name Toby, and were said to also be able to read minds.

===Maude===
Maude was a pet owned by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and his family during his presidency (1901–1909).

===Max===

Max was the Vietnamese potbellied pig pet of George Clooney, often referred to as &quot;Max the star&quot; by Clooney. The pig shared Clooney&#x27;s Hollywood Hills home, also Clooney&#x27;s bed, and frequently made cameos in interviews, mostly because of his size. Max died in 2006.

===Pigasus===

Pigasus was a tongue-in-cheek candidate for President of the United States run by the Yippies at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

===Snobben===
Snobben was a Norwegian pet pig that received national attention when the owner&#x27;s car was stolen in 2001, with the pet pig inside. The car was found five days later, with the pig in good shape. At the time Snobben was already known locally in Oslo, where he during the late 1990s was often seen doing the groceries alone at Majorstuen.

===The Tamworth Two===

The Tamworth Two, named Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Pig, were two Tamworth Ginger pigs who escaped while being unloaded from a lorry at an abattoir in the English town of Malmesbury, Wiltshire in January 1998. The pigs were on the run for over a week, and the search for them caused a huge media sensation, as well as immense public interest, both in Britain and abroad.

=== Thunder and Bolt ===

Thunder and Bolt are a pair of certified therapy animals, raised by a 10-year-old girl, who have garnered national attention in the US for visiting hospitals and nursing homes.

===Tirpitz===
Tirpitz was a pig captured from the German Navy after a naval skirmish following the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914. He subsequently became the mascot of the cruiser HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot;.

===Unnamed pig===
In 1859, an unnamed British-owned pig wandered into Lyman Cutlar&#x27;s potato patch on San Juan Island, 
Washington, and was shot, thus setting off a (small) cold war known as the Pig War.

==Large pigs==

This is a list of pigs that are notable for their abnormally large size.

===Curly Boy===
In March 1901, an article appeared in the Rushville, Illinois newspaper, the &quot;Rushville Times&quot;, telling of the slaughter of a 1,255 pound hog. This article was later printed in the Schuyler County, Illinois historical newsletter &quot;The Schuylerite&quot; 14:1 (Spring 1985): 
&quot;Curly Boy Slaughtered
The above caption may appear misleading and cause the TIMES readers to think there has been a slaughter of a tow-headed boy, but it was meant to tell of the death of Samuel A. Stephen&#x27;s big hog in Chicago. Mr. Stephens shipped the 1,255 pound porker from here last week and he reached Chicago safely. All along the way, whenever the train stopped, there gathered a crowd of persons to see the hog. At the Union Stock Yards in Chicago he attracted not a little attention and drew a crowd like a monkey show in the country. At the packing house where he was killed, the foreman ordered the butchers to hang him up on cattle chains, as the regular hog chains were not made for such as he. His skin was carefully removed and was turned over to a taxidermist, who will cure it and mount the animal in a life size position.&quot;

===Hogzilla===

Hogzilla is the name given to a wild hog that was shot and killed in Alapaha, Georgia, on June 17, 2004. Alleged to be long and to weigh , scientists confirmed that Hogzilla actually weighed and was between long.

===Coursey hog===

On January 5, 2007, a feral hog was shot in Fayetteville, Georgia. Neighbours reported that the animal had been seen in the neighborhood several times over the preceding days. A spokesperson from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources said that large boars and feral hogs were common in southern Georgia, but that no records are kept on them. The media latched on to the notion that this animal rivals the size of Hogzilla.

===Hog Kong===
Hog Kong was an estimated wild hog killed in August 2004.

===Big Bill===
The world record for the fattest pig so far is held by Big Bill, owned by Elias Buford Butler of Jackson, Tennessee. It was a Poland China breed of hog that tipped the scales at in 1933. Bill was due to be exhibited at the Chicago World Fair when he broke a leg and had to be put down. At about this point in time, the trend in hog production began to shift to hogs that were much trimmer and very lean.

===Ton Pig===

Ton Pig was a domestic hog from China owned by Xu Changjin that weighed in at . Ton died from lack of mobility because of obesity on February 4, 2004. It was sent to the Liaoning Agriculture Museum in Shenyang, for display.

===Big Norm===
Big Norm was owned by Robert Peterson of Hamilton, New York. Even though fed on regular hog feed, Norm grew to large proportions estimated at . Big Norm died of apparent heart failure in 2008.

<text>Virginia&#x27;s musical contribution to American culture has been diverse, and includes Piedmont blues, jazz, folk, brass, hip-hop, and rock and roll bands, as well as the founding origins of country music in the Bristol sessions by Appalachian Virginians.

The origin of music from within the state is very diverse, including cities such as Richmond, college towns such as Charlottesville and Fredericksburg, and the rural areas of Southwestern Virginia along &quot;The Crooked Road”.

==State song==
&quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot; by James A. Bland was Virginia&#x27;s state song from 1940 until 1997; it now has emeritus status. &quot;Oh Shenandoah&quot; was the interim state song from January 2006, and its melody was used for &quot;Our Great Virginia,&quot; with lyrics by Mike Greenly, which became the official state song in 2015. The same year, &quot;Sweet Virginia Breeze,&quot; written in 1978 by Steve Bassett and Robbin Thompson became the official popular state song; the runner-up was &quot;Virginia, the Home of My Heart&quot;.

== Birthplace of Southern shape note music ==
 In 1816 Ananias Davisson of Rockingham County published a shape note tunebook containing folk melodies collected during his travels, entitled &quot;Kentucky Harmony&quot;. At a time when the musicians in the North were turning to Europe and ridiculing the composers of the First New England School, Davisson&#x27;s focus on grassroots regional music was widely imitated in the South.

==Notable music artists from Virginia by genre==
One of Virginia&#x27;s most famous musical contributions is the country singer Patsy Cline. Several towns claim her as their own, including Gore and Winchester. Winchester is home to several Patsy Cline attractions, including a driving tour published by the local Chamber of Commerce, and the Kurtz Cultural Center/Old Town Visitor&#x27;s Center, which shows various Cline memorabilia. The Golden Gate Quartet founded in 1931 are widely regarded as the founders of jubilee and the sound of many male vocal groups that came after them. Their musical influence crosses multiple genres including gospel, jazz, blues, hip hop, soul and R&amp;B. The legacy continues on through a new version of the Golden Gate in France and former lead singer Charles West from Chesapeake, Virginia.

Jim &amp; Jesse McReynolds and the Virginia Boys, Ralph Stanley, Hobart Smith, The Statler Brothers, and The Carter Family are award-winning bluegrass and country musicians from Virginia. Ella Fitzgerald and Pearl Bailey were both from Newport News. Hip hop and rhythm and blues acts like Missy Elliott, Timbaland, The Neptunes, Clipse, Chad Hugo, Nottz, Young Dez and Bink hail from the commonwealth. The Neptunes produced 43% of all songs on American radio in 2003. Singer-songwriters from Virginia include Jason Mraz and jam bands like the Pat McGee Band and Dave Matthews Band (violinist Boyd Tinsley attended the University of Virginia), who continue their strong charitable connection to Charlottesville, Virginia. Heavy metal progenitors and innovators of doom metal, Pentagram, were founded in Alexandria Influential stage-rock group GWAR as well as heavy metal group Lamb of God began at Virginia Commonwealth University. Alternative Rock group Seven Mary Three formed at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.

==Music venues and institutions==

For larger concerts and events, Virginia has the Ferguson Center for the Arts (Christopher Newport University) in Newport News, Va, Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow (marketed as D.C. for most tours), the Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater at Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach, the Richmond Coliseum, the Hampton Coliseum and the Norfolk Scope. Vienna is home to the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, the only national park for the arts in the United States. Wolf Trap features a large outdoor amphitheatre, the 7,000 seat Filene Center, as well as a smaller indoor venue called The Barns. The Old Dominion Opry is another major venue, located near Colonial Williamsburg, a popular tourist attraction.

Virginia&#x27;s other prominent music venues include The Birchmere in Alexandria, a local country and bluegrass club where Mary Chapin Carpenter performed early in her career. The Landmark Theater in Richmond and the Harrison Opera House in Norfolk both host the Virginia Opera. Phase 2 (the former Cattle Annie&#x27;s, but significantly remodeling in 2010) is a popular, large club venue in Lynchburg with a reputation for attracting prominent performers. Garth Newel Music Center in Hot Springs was once a farm that is now known for classical, jazz, and blues concerts with gourmet meals and views from the side of Warm Springs Mountain. The Shenandoah Valley Music Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary of summer concert in 2013 and continues to draw people to the tiny Shenandoah County village of Orkney Springs.

Richmond&#x27;s 929 West Grace Street has housed a punk and rock-oriented club nearly uninterrupted for nearly three decades. Most famously known as Twisters throughout the 1990s, more recently the building has been known as Club 929, The Nanci Raygun, and Bagel Czar before re-opening in 2009 as Strange Matter. Like its predecessors, Strange Matter hosts up-and-coming local and national touring acts nearly every night. Alley Katz in Richmond continues to have regular shows. Toad&#x27;s Place accommodated midsized bands in 2007 and 2008 but closed shortly after that time. Another midsized venue is The National, which holds around 1,500 people.

The Hampton Roads area also has several more intimate venues. The most prominent of them is the Norva Theatre, which is a small club-style venue for smaller to mid-size acts.

The Shenandoah Valley hosts a few smaller venues. The mockingbird in downtown Staunton hosted a 168-seat newly renovated grass roots and acoustic music hall, but closed early in 2013. Clementine café in downtown Harrisonburg has cemented itself as the premier venue in the valley.

In the late 1960s and the 1970s, the Alexandria Roller Rink hosted many festival style concerts, among which, bands like Yes, Jethro Tull, and many others appeared.

The Virginia Musical Museum &amp; Virginia Music Hall of Fame in Williamsburg, VA. opened in 2013. The museum and hall of fame displays instruments, memorabilia, pictures and history of Virginia music artists. New Virginia artists are inducted into the Virginia Music Hall of Fame each year.

==Music festivals==
FloydFest is a popular music festival which is not actually within Floyd County but in the county just next to Floyd called Patrick County. This is a bit of FloydFest trivia that mostly the locals know about. The festival began in 2002 and features camping and a wide range of music from bluegrass, rock, reggae, folk, zydeco, African, and Appalachian.

In 2005, 2006, and 2007, Richmond hosted the National Folk Festival that features Virginia-area regional folk music as well as folk musicians from around the world. Many previous NFF sites have continued to conduct a regional folk festival when the NFF moves to the next site and Richmond has done the same in the form of the Richmond Folk Festival.

The Virginia Blues &amp; Jazz Festival was started in 2006 at Garth Newel Music Center in Hot Springs. It is held each June and has featured national acts like Taj Mahal, The Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Buckwheat Zydeco, and Eric Lindell.

The MACRoCk festival happens the beginning of April every year in Harrisonburg VA. It has featured national acts like
MewithoutYou, Q and Not U, Fugazi, The Faint, Archers of Loaf, Dismemberment Plan, Sufjan Stevens, Prefuse 73, Mates of State, The Wrens, Converge, Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Of Montreal, Norma Jean, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Superchunk, Elliott Smith, An Albatross, Coheed and Cambria, Avail, and Engine Down.

The Blue Ridge Rock Festival, a Hard Rock/Heavy Metal music festival has been held in Virginia since 2017. It has been held each year except for 2020 due to COVID-19. The festival was held at DeVault Vineyards in Concord, VA in 2017 and 2018, at Oak Ridge in Arrington, VA in 2019, at White Oak Mountain Amphitheater in Blairs, VA in 2021, at Virginia International Raceway (VIR) in Alton, VA in 2022 and was held at VIR again in 2023, however, the festival was cancelled after just two days in 2023 due to various reasons. GWAR from Richmond played at Blue Ridge Rock Festival in 2022. Lamb of God from Richmond played at Blue Ridge Rock Festival in 2018, 2021, and 2022.

===Blue Ridge mountain music===
Southwest Virginia is, along with western North Carolina, part of the Blue Ridge area, home to a distinctive style of old-time music sometimes called &quot;mountain music&quot;, which is a vibrant tradition most famously celebrated through an annual series of festivals. Galax is a small town that is home to the Old Fiddlers&#x27; Convention, held since 1935; it is the largest and oldest festival of old-time Appalachian music in the country. The convention has given Galax the nickname the &quot;Capital of Old-Time Mountain Music&quot;. The Convention attracts upwards of 20,000 visitors to witness many of the most renowned American folk, country and bluegrass performers, as well as regional stars. Galax and the surrounding area has long been a rich part of American, and Virginian music, and is known for an intricate fiddling style and instrumental and vocal traditions; music collectors like Peter Seeger and Alan Lomax visited Galax and recorded the region&#x27;s music.

Though the Galax Old Fiddlers&#x27; Convention is a major focal point for the Blue Ridge&#x27;s vibrant folk music scene, the region is home to a major music festival season, which is inaugurated by the late March Fairview Ruritan Club Fiddlers&#x27; Convention, which hosts a major regional competition in several categories. Ferrum College in Ferrum is home to the annual Blue Ridge Folklife Festival, which has been held every October since 1973. The White Top Mountain–Mount Rogers area is home to the Wayne Henderson Music Festival &amp; Guitar Competition, as well as a number of regional festivals, with mountain music as a major part of the White Top Mountain Molasses Festival, the White Top Mountain Maple Festival, and the White Top Mountain Ramp Festival. The aforementioned FloydFest always features bluegrass and traditional Appalachian mountain music. Local mountain music festivals in Virginia abound in small towns like Fries, Wytheville, Troutdale, Vesta, Stuart, Bassett, Baywood and Elk Creek, as well as at the Grayson Highlands State Park near Mouth of Wilson.

Farther southwest, The Carter Family Fold, in the Carter Family hometown of Hiltons, hosts an annual folk music festival as well as weekly concerts. Johnny Cash often visited the Hiltons area and The Fold with his wife, June Carter Cash. In fact, Johnny Cash&#x27;s last public performance was at The Fold in the summer of 2003. The area around the Virginia and Kentucky border, folk, country and bluegrass remains a vital regional tradition. Norton is home to the Virginia Kentucky Opry and a historic music venue called the Country Cabin, while local festivals include the Doc Boggs Festival (in Wise), and the Ralph Stanley&#x27;s Annual Memorial Weekend Bluegrass Festival.[1]

==Country music==
Virginia&#x27;s contributions to country music include the legendary singer Patsy Cline, pioneering performers The Carter Family and Staunton&#x27;s Statler Brothers, who were one of the most popular country acts in the country in the 1970s and 1980s.

Bristol, TN/VA has been designated by Congress as the &#x27;Birthplace of Country Music&#x27;. In 1927 record producer Ralph Peer of Victor Records began recording local musicians in Bristol, to attempt to capture the local sound of traditional &quot;folk&quot; music of the region. One of these local sounds was created by the Carter Family, which got its start on July 31, 1927, when A.P. Carter and his family journeyed from Maces Spring, Virginia, to Bristol to audition for Ralph Peer, who was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. They received $50 for each song they recorded. That same visit by Peer to Bristol also resulted in the first recordings by Jimmie Rodgers. These 1927 sessions became known as the Big Bang of Country Music. Since 1994, the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance has promoted the city as a destination to learn about country music and the city&#x27;s role in the creation of an entire music genre. Currently, the Alliance is organizing the building of a new Cultural Heritage Center to help educate the public about the history of country music in the region.

The Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion is held every September on State Street in Downtown Bristol and celebrates the city&#x27;s contribution to country music. It has grown to become one of the more popular music festivals in Virginia and the Appalachia region, as close to 50,000 people attended the festival in 2012.

==Hardcore punk and heavy metal==
The city of Richmond has long had one of the more active punk rock scenes on the East Coast. The city is perhaps best known for shock-punk-metal band GWAR, known for wild on-stage antics. GWAR grew out of Death Piggy, a hardcore punk band that followed in the footsteps of local scene leaders White Cross, Beex, and The Prevaricators. However Richmond punk became big with Avail. The Richmond punk scene grew, including: Inquisition, Fun Size, Knucklehed, Uphill Down, Four Walls Falling, The Social Dropouts, Ann Beretta, Sixer, River City High, BraceWar, Smoke or Fire (originally from Boston), Strike Anywhere,and many underground bands. Among music venues existing during the Richmond &#x27;80s, Benny&#x27;s, a bar near the campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, served as an anchor for the punk scene despite its small size.

Richmond punk is often mistakenly considered to be an offshoot of the D.C. scene, however Richmond punk bands have developed a unique sound, often influenced by country, folk, and southern rock (particularly prevalent in Avail, Sixer, and Ann Beretta, and to a lesser degree in Strike Anywhere). This is most likely due to the fact that Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy during most of the Civil War, is arguably the oldest and most lively punk scene in the South. Richmond punk has a close relationship with punk from Gainesville, Florida, particularly between Avail and the now-disbanded Hot Water Music. Other hardcore bands from Richmond included Unseen Force, God&#x27;s Will, Graven Image, and Honor Role.

Richmond also has an active metal scene that includes, in addition to GWAR, Lamb of God, Alabama Thunderpussy, Municipal Waste. The metal scene is closely related the city&#x27;s punk rockers, and, like the punks, there is a Southern influence in the music of Lamb of God and particularly in Alabama Thunderpussy. Richmond still harbors an extremely strong hardcore scene, emerging from the shadows of the mid-1980s Four Walls Falling, Fed Up, Set Straight, Step Above, Count Me Out and Dead Serious. More recently a resurgence of old school hardcore punk has risen from Richmond with such bands as Direct Control, Government Warning, Wasted Time, etc. Richmond also has a small post-hardcore scene with bands such as Remaniscense, Wow, Owls! and Ultra Dolphins.

Norfolk was known, during hardcore&#x27;s heyday, for violent clashes between punks and local military personnel from the Navy base. Ray Barbieri (Agnostic Front, Warzone) and John Joseph McGeown (Cro-Mags) became punks while serving in Norfolk after a judge&#x27;s order.

Prompted by a 1983 article printed in Maximum Rocknroll which criticized the Virginia Beach-Norfolk metro area, formerly referred to as &quot;Tidewater,&quot; as devoid of punk bands relative to Richmond, Jeff Clites, creator of the Tidewater-based &#x27;zine, &quot;The Tidewater A.R.S.E.&quot;, responded:

<doc id="308338" wikidata="Q6942218" url="?curid=308338" title="Music of North Carolina">
<text>The U.S. state of North Carolina is known particularly for its history of old-time music. Many recordings were made in the early 20th century by folk song collector Bascom Lamar Lunsford. Influential North Carolina country musicians such as the North Carolina Ramblers and Al Hopkins helped solidify the sound of country music in the late 1920s, while influential bluegrass musicians such as Earl Scruggs and Doc Watson came from North Carolina. Arthur Smith had the first nationally syndicated television program which featured country music. He composed &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot;, the all-time best selling guitar instrumental, and &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;, the all-time best selling banjo composition. Country artist Eric Church from the Hickory area, has had multiple No. 1 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, including &quot;Chief&quot; in 2011. Both North and South Carolina are a hotbed for traditional country blues, especially the style known as the Piedmont blues. Elizabeth Cotten, from Chapel Hill, was active in the American folk music revival.

Because of their proximity to universities, areas such as Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill (collectively known as the Triangle), Asheville, Greensboro, Greenville, Charlotte, and Wilmington have long been a well-known center for indie rock, metal, punk, jazz, country and hip-hop. Bands and groups from this popular music scene include folk rock The Avett Brothers from the Charlotte area (had a No. 3 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2016 with &quot;True Sadness&quot;), Troop 41, Corrosion of Conformity, Superchunk, The Rosebuds, The Love Language, Benji Hughes, Jon Lindsay, Tift Merritt, Ben Folds Five, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Lords of the Underground, Between the Buried and Me, Mandolin Orange, and He Is Legend. Concord has hosted the annual three-day Carolina Rebellion hard rock music festival each May at Charlotte Motor Speedway since 2011.

Additional notable North Carolina musicians include country singers Andy Griffith from Mt. Airy, Charlie Daniels (d. 2020) (the bluegrass influenced &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; 1979) from Wilmington, Ronnie Milsap (&quot;Smoky Mountain Rain&quot; 1980), Randy Travis from the Charlotte area (&quot;Forever and Ever, Amen&quot; 1987), Kellie Pickler from the Charlotte area, Scotty McCreery from the Raleigh area (Had a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with Clear as Day in 2011), Parmalee (&quot;Carolina&quot; 2013), and Luke Combs (had a No. 1 album on Billboard 200 with &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; in 2019) and Chase Rice (had a No. 3 album on Billboard 200 with &quot;Ignite the Night&quot; in 2014), both from Asheville. Soul singer Ben E. King (d. 2015) (&quot;Stand by Me&quot; 1961). Glam metal band FireHouse (&quot;All She Wrote&quot; 1991) from Charlotte, Pop rock band Athenaeum from Greensboro, Fred Durst from Gastonia-lead singer of Limp Bizkit, and alternative metal band Decyfer Down. Beach music group The Catalinas (&quot;Summertime&#x27;s Calling Me&quot; 1975) is from Charlotte, and pop singer Clay Aiken (the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 &quot;This Is the Night&quot; 2003) is from Raleigh.

Notable rappers, producers, and people in hip-hop from North Carolina include: J. Cole, DaBaby (had a Billboard No. 1 Hot 100 hit with &quot;Rockstar&quot; in 2020, Petey Pablo, 9th Wonder, Rapsody, Fred Durst, Mez, Lute, Ski Beatz, Deniro Farrar, and Cordae.

==Indigenous music==

==Early black string band music==
Slave musicians in North Carolina and throughout the country were often responsible for providing the dance music for both white and African American social gatherings. If a slave was trained as a musician, their value as property went up for their masters. String bands were formed to accompany the social dancing. After slaves were given their freedom, small communities of blacks began to form in the North Carolina Piedmont region. One of these communities outside of Statesville, North Carolina had enough of a fiddler population to support a fiddler&#x27;s convention. Joe Thompson, an African American fiddler who died in 2012, is from the Cedar Grove community in North Carolina. The banjo was another popular instrument for African Americans to play in a string band. The banjo is an instrument adapted from its African relative the akonting, and younger black musicians often learned to play from older community members. One black musician, Joe Fulp, from the Walnut Cove community used the banjo to help pass the time while waiting for tobacco to cure. String Bands of the North Carolina Piedmont region had their own sound consisting of long bow fiddle playing, flowing banjo lines, and a prominent bass line provided by the guitar, an instrument added to the ensemble in the early 20th century. The style of Piedmont string bands was influenced by the dance tune melodies of Europe and the rhythmic complexity of African banjo playing.

==Gospel music==
North Carolina is also considered a cradle of gospel music. The Moravians who established the town of Winston-Salem had published Europe&#x27;s first hymnal in the 15th century, and had brought from the Czech Republic and Saxony many instruments including skills to build pipe organs. Music was an integral part of community life. Everyone participated in brass bands and knew the songs which told of births, deaths and other events. The Moravian Music Foundation in Old Salem contains the archive of these materials.

In the days of slavery, spirituals played a huge role in the lives of the slaves of North Carolina elite, and after emancipation, this stayed true. During the 1940s and 50s, North Carolina was a favorite place to visit of gospel singers for many reasons, among which was North Carolina&#x27;s less rigorous Jim Crow laws. North Carolina is also home to many famous gospel singers, the most famous being Shirley Caesar, known as the &quot;First Lady of Gospel&quot;. Caesar got her start when the group The Caravans came through Wilson in 1958. North Carolina is also famous for its abundance of family gospel groups which thrive all throughout the state. Award-winning vocal group The Kingsmen originate in Asheville.

==Piedmont blues==

The Piedmont blues is a type of blues music characterized by a unique finger-picking method on the guitar in which a regular, alternating-thumb bass pattern supports a melody using treble strings. Blind Boy Fuller (1904–1941) was a popular Piedmont blues guitarist, who played for tips outside tobacco warehouses in Durham during the 1930s. Fuller recorded more than 120 sides during the second half of the 1930s. Floyd Council (1911–1976) sometimes busked with Fuller. South Carolina-born Piedmont blues musician Rev. Gary Davis (1896–1972) also played in Durham in the 1930s when the city had a thriving black business community and an emerging black middle class. Singer and guitarist Carolina Slim (1923–1953) also worked as a musician around Durham. Etta Baker (1913–2006) was first recorded in 1956. Singer, guitarist, and songwriter John Dee Holeman (1929–2021) was based in Durham from 1954 to his death.

Cultural organizations in North Carolina have supported the preservation of the Piedmont blues. The Greensboro-based Piedmont Blues Preservation Society has partnered with musicians such as Max Drake (born 1952) and a number of public schools in North Carolina to provide performances, exhibitions, and educational programs.

==Jazz musicians==
Several notable jazz musicians were originally from North Carolina. In the case of bebop pianist Thelonious Monk, (b. Rocky Mount, NC, October 10, 1917) the North Carolina connection is slight, as Monk&#x27;s family moved to Manhattan when Monk was four. Saxophonist John Coltrane 1926–1967) spent most of his childhood in High Point, North Carolina, before moving to Philadelphia when he was sixteen. Bebop pioneer Max Roach was born in Newland, but like Monk, moved with his family to New York City when he was four. Other jazz musicians from North Carolina include guitarist Tal Farlow, considered one of the top players during the 1950s. Hard-bop saxophonists Lou Donaldson and Tina Brooks were originally North Carolinians. Hard-bop trumpeter Woody Shaw, pianist Billy Taylor, saxophonist and flautist Harold Vick, pianist and singer dubbed the &quot;High Priestess of Soul&quot; Dr. Nina Simone, alto saxophonist Tab Smith, bassist Percy Heath, and singer June Tyson were born in the state as well. South Carolinian Dizzy Gillespie grew up just over the state line and attended school at the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina. Jazz composer and arranger Billy Strayhorn spent some of his summers in Hillsborough, NC with his grandparents.

==Rock==
Rock and roll guitarist, songwriter, and vocalist Link Wray, who first came to popularity in the late 1950s, was born in Dunn. Other musicians of note include guitarist Audley Freed who was born in Burgaw and played with Lynyrd Skynyrd; Jason Roy, who was founder of the Christian Rock group Building 429 from Fayetteville; and vocalist James &quot;Jimi&quot; Bennett, who was from Leland and sang in the Christian rock group King James. The platinum-selling post-grunge band Daughtry is from a suburb of Greensboro. Daughtry has had two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, including &quot;Daughtry&quot; in 2006. Daughtry had four No. 1 songs on the Adult Top 40 chart in the late 2000s. Alternative country singer Ryan Adams from Raleigh had a No. 4 album on the Billboard 200 in 2014.

===Chapel Hill rock===

Chapel Hill&#x27;s music scene dates back to the 1950s, and began to take off in the 1960s, when the Cat&#x27;s Cradle Coffeehouse nurtured local folk activity. One of the first local legends, The Corsayers (later The Fabulous Corsairs) – featuring Alex Taylor and younger brother James – could be heard around town. Later, Arrogance became a major part of the folk scene. James Taylor would go on to a successful career as a singer-songwriter, and his &quot;Carolina in My Mind&quot; would become an unofficial anthem for the state. His song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; was a No. 1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1971. The Chapel Hill Museum opened a permanent exhibit dedicated to Taylor; at the same occasion the US-15-501 highway bridge over Morgan Creek, near the site of the Taylor family home and mentioned in Taylor&#x27;s song &quot;Copperline&quot;, was dedicated to Taylor.

The Chapel Hill music scene began to pick up steam in the 1980s when bands including The Pressure Boys, The Connells, Flat Duo Jets, Southern Culture on the Skids, A Number of Things, Fetchin Bones, and Snatches of Pink began releasing their own records or signing to independent record labels.

In the late 1980s through the mid-1990s and 2000s, the Chapel Hill scene reached its peak as bands such as Superchunk, Polvo, Archers of Loaf, Alternative States, Small, Zen Frisbee, Dillon Fence, Sex Police, Pipe, The Veldt, Metal Flake Mother were signed to local and national labels.

In the late 1990s, gold record and platinum success came to Chapel Hill bands Squirrel Nut Zippers and the piano pop trio Ben Folds Five (who had a comeback with a No. 10 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot; in 2012).

===Punk rock and metal===
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill was a regional center for punk rock in the late 1970s, due to its large number of college students. The first wave of bands were more power-pop than punk, and included Peter Holsapple &amp; the H-Bombs, Sneakers, Secret Service, Nevermind, and Chris Stamey and the dBs. The punks arrived shortly after with &#x27;th Cigaretz, The Dads, the Bad Checks, Butchwax, The X-Teens, Human Furniture, and the Junkie Sluts. Later hardcore punk bands included Corrosion of Conformity, No Labels, Colcor, UNICEF, Stillborn Christians, DAMM, Bloodmobile, Subculture, Sacred Cows, Ugly Americans, 30 Foot Beast, Sodium Citrate, Mission DC, the Celibate Commandos, Rights Reserved, DLW, Creeping Flesh, Time Bomb, Stations of the Cross, A Number of Things, and Oral Fixation.

Christian pop punk band Philmont also originates from Charlotte.

===Alternative rock===
Rainbow Kitten Surprise (from Boone), Sylvan Esso, Ben Folds Five, and Charlotte&#x27;s Paper Tongues (&quot;Ride to California&quot; 2009), Will*Saint Creek are all from North Carolina.

In Hickory, there is also the Western Piedmont Symphony and its accompanying youth orchestra, the Western Piedmont Youth Symphony.

Several professional wind ensembles also exist, including the Piedmont Wind Symphony of Winston-Salem and the Wilmington Symphonic Winds.

== Folk music ==
Folk music is a unique genre of music that represents familial connections and emotional relationships between artists and the subjects about which they are singing. Specifically in Western North Carolina, this genre represents much of the culture and experiences of these people. While there are many different variations of folk music, all of them seek to build communities in an attempt to enhance cultural conversations and gatherings. The Appalachian area is famous for its ability to bring people together through the transmission of folk classics and authentic voices. These connections also form to share more about a particular region through song that depicts different cultural elements and interests of the people and time.

Folk music is extremely important to the history and culture of Western North Carolina. Most notably, the Appalachian Mountains contain a record of folk music being recited and passed down from generation to generation. Much of this information relating to the vibrant folk music culture in this area of North Carolina comes from The Frank Clyde Brown Collection located at Duke University in Durham. This archive gives historians insight into the various artists and songs that were commonly being performed during this time. For example, Frank Proffitt and others constantly performed the infamous song &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; as a way to show their regional pride. These performances show the popularity that folk music held throughout Western North Carolina, especially during its revitalization in the 1950s.
A unique aspect of folk music is its dependence on being orally transmitted. This occurred for many different reasons, many of which deal with the lack of accessibility in Western North Carolina to other places. There was very little communication between these tiny towns and other North Carolina areas, especially when discussing the lack of railroads connecting urban areas to these rural towns; because of that, other expression styles could not be transferred easily. Therefore, it relied solely on the artists to ensure that their favorite renditions of particular folk songs were passed on from one generation to the next. With this ability placed on the artists, there is definitely an impact on the accuracy of the words when transmitting these lyrics over and over again. However, this has often been seen as the beauty and pride of various folk music artists in North Carolina.

For example, tiny western mountainous areas such as Elk Park host a plethora of folk music artists whose memory still lives on in the Frank Clyde Brown Collection. The Church family, headed by Erleen and her husband Truman, epitomize the intentionality of folk singers through their authentic renditions of songs and commitment to bringing communities together in song. Music recorded such as &quot;Black Jack Davy&quot; and &quot;The Titanic&quot; show the importance of continuing the tradition of old time folk songs to be orally transmitted into future generations. This idea of a family unit performing folk music together further supports the mission of this genre to connect communities through a shared culture.

A common practice in folk music is to bring an artist&#x27;s personal dialect into the respective song or ballad. Plenty of times, specific words and phrases will be altered depending on from which region the Appalachian folk music singer performed. To focus on a specific song to give a more clear example, the folk ballad Black Jack Davy has many different variations, solely based on how the song was transmitted from one region of North Carolina to the next. As many different variations of this ballad have been sung, many of them classify as different names. Within the Ozark Folksong Collection, Black Jack Davy has titles ranging from &quot;Gypsy Davy&quot; and &quot;Black Jack Daisy.&quot; This shows the power of the artist in transmitting the words and themes from one artist to the next.

The Frank Clyde Brown Collection is arguably the largest compilation of North Carolina folk music in the nation. This collection includes various versions of songs, artists, and styles of reciting this cultural element. Charles Bond, a former Duke University undergraduate student, accidentally fell upon this collection of archives. Ever since, he has been delving into them to learn about the history of Appalachia folk music and the impact it had on families all around this area. With the discovery of this archive, families along Western North Carolina have recently been able to obtain copies of their beloved family members singing local music.

Through the study of folk music, people today are able to reconnect to the rich cultural history of North Carolina of the past. The projects of the Frank Clyde Brown Collection and other folk music initiatives are introducing the people of the present to a popular form of expression in the past. Going forward, Duke University students are looking to explore a plethora of these archives to learn more about the history surrounding folk music in North Carolina. Through an Archives Alive course currently taught by Professor Trudi Abel, seven students have engaged in a Bass Connections project to uncover more information about this folk music. These projects have culminated into online, digitized sources of knowledge about various folk artists, their hometowns, and the songs they have performed.

North Carolina is home to many groups from the Indie Folk and Progressive Bluegrass scenes, including Mandolin Orange and Mipso from Chapel Hill, Beta Radio from Wilmington, Steep Canyon Rangers from Brevard, Avett Brothers from Concord, River Whyless from Asheville, Old Crow Medicine Show from Boone, The Collection from Greensboro, and Bombadil and Carolina Chocolate Drops from Durham.

<text>The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978, or &quot;MARPOL 73/78&quot; (short for &quot;marine pollution&quot;) is one of the most important international marine environmental conventions. It was developed by the International Maritime Organization with an objective to minimize pollution of the oceans and seas, including dumping, oil and air pollution.

The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973, but did not come into force at the signing date. The current convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol, which entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of January 2018, 156 states are parties to the convention, being flag states of 99.42% of the world&#x27;s shipping tonnage.

All ships flagged under countries that are signatories to MARPOL are subject to its requirements, regardless of where they sail, and member nations are responsible for vessels registered on their national ship registry.

==Provisions ==
MARPOL is divided into Annexes according to various categories of pollutants, each of which deals with the regulation of a particular group of ship emissions.

=== Annex I ===

MARPOL Annex I came into force on 2 October 1983 and deals with the discharge of oil into the ocean environment. It incorporates the oil discharge criteria prescribed in the 1969 amendments to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil (OILPOL). It specifies tanker design features that are intended to minimize oil discharge into the ocean during ship operations and in case of accidents. It provides regulations with regard to the treatment of engine room bilge water (OWS) for all large commercial vessels and ballast and tank cleaning waste (ODME). It also introduces the concept of &quot;special sea areas (PPSE)&quot;, which are considered to be at risk to pollution by oil. Discharge of oil within them has been completely outlawed, with a few minimal exceptions.

The first half of MARPOL Annex I deals with engine room waste. There are various generations of technologies and equipment that have been developed to prevent waste such as oily water separators (OWS), oil content meters (OCM), and port reception facilities.

The second part of the MARPOL Annex I has more to do with cleaning the cargo areas and tanks. Oil discharge monitoring equipment (ODME) is a very important technology mentioned in MARPOL Annex I that has greatly helped improve sanitation in these areas.

The oil record book is another integral part of MARPOL Annex I, helping crew members log and keep track of oily wastewater discharges, among other things.

=== Annex II === 
MARPOL Annex II came into force on 2 October 1983. It details the discharge criteria for the elimination of pollution by noxious liquid substances carried in large quantities. It divides substances into and introduces detailed operational standards and measures. The discharge of pollutants is allowed only to reception facilities with certain concentrations and tions. No matter what, no discharge of residues containing pollutants is permitted within of the nearest land. Stricter restrictions apply to &quot;special areas&quot;.

Annex II covers the International Bulk Chemical Code (IBC Code) in conjunction with Chapter 7 of the SOLAS Convention. Previously, chemical tankers constructed before must comply with the requirements of the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (BCH Code).

=== Annex III ===
MARPOL Annex III came into force on 1 July 1992. It contains general requirements for the standards on packing, marking, labeling, documentation, stowage, quantity subtraction, division and notifications for preventing pollution by harmful substances. The Annex is in line with the procedures detailed in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, which has been expanded to include marine pollutants. The amendments entered into force on 1 January 1991.

=== Annex IV ===
Marpol Annex IV came into force on 27 September 2003. It introduces requirements to control pollution of the sea by sewage from ships.

=== Annex V ===

MARPOL Annex V (&quot;Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships&quot;) came into force on 31 December 1988. It specifies the distances from land in which materials may be disposed of and subdivides different types of garbage and marine debris. The requirements are much stricter in a number of &quot;special areas&quot; but perhaps the most prominent part of the Annex is the complete ban of dumping plastic into the ocean.

=== Annex VI ===
MARPOL Annex VI came into force on 19 May 2005. It introduces requirements to regulate the air pollution being emitted by ships, including the emission of ozone-depleting substances, Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Sulfur Oxides (SOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and shipboard incineration. It also establishes requirements for reception facilities for wastes from exhaust gas cleaning systems, incinerators, fuel oil quality, off-shore platforms and drilling rigs, and the establishment of Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs).

==== IMO 2020 ====
As of 1 January 2020, new emission standards are enforced for fuel oil used by ships, in a regulation known as IMO 2020. The global sulphur limit (outside SECA&#x27;s) dropped from an allowed 3.5% sulphur in marine fuels to 0.5%. This will significantly improve the air quality in many populated coastal and port areas, which will prevent over 100,000 early deaths each year, and many more cases of asthma in these regions and cities. Over 170 countries have signed on to the changes, including the United States. This is expected to create massive changes for the shipping and oil industries, with major updates required to ships and the increased production of lower sulfur fuel.

Bunker fuels used within an emission control zone (i.e. North Sea) must have a sulphur content level of less than 0.1% (1000ppm).

The IMO has worked on ensuring consistent implementation of the 0.5% sulphur limit in its Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) and its subcommittee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR). This has led to the development on several regulatory and practical measures (FONAR&#x27;s, Carriage Ban, Ship Implementation Plan etc.) to enable any non-compliance to be detected, for example during port state controls (PSC&#x27;s).

==Amendments==

MARPOL Annex VI amendments according with MEPC 176(58) came into force 1 July 2010.

Amended Regulations 12 concerns control and record keeping of Ozone Depleting Substances.

Amended Regulation 14 concerns mandatory fuel oil change over procedures for vessels entering or leaving SECA areas and FO sulphur limits.

MARPOL Annex V has been amended multiple times, changing different aspects of the original text.

MEPC.219(63) came into force on 2 March 2012 to generally prohibit the discharge of any garbage into the ocean, with the exception of food wastes, cargo residues, wash-water, and animal carcasses. There are further provisions describing when and how to dispose of the acceptable wastes.

MEPC.220(63) came into force on 2 March 2012 to encourage the creation of a waste management plan on-board vessels.

==Implementation and enforcement==

In order for IMO standards to be binding, they must first be ratified by a total number of member countries whose combined gross tonnage represents at least 50% of the world&#x27;s gross tonnage, a process that can be lengthy. A system of tacit acceptance has therefore been put into place, whereby, if no objections are heard from a member state after a certain period has elapsed, it is assumed they have assented to the treaty.

All six Annexes have been ratified by the requisite number of nations; the most recent is Annex VI, which took effect in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered (Flag State) is responsible for certifying the ship&#x27;s compliance with MARPOL&#x27;s pollution prevention standards. Each signatory nation is responsible for enacting domestic laws to implement the convention and effectively pledges to comply with the convention, annexes, and related laws of other nations. In the United States, for example, the relevant implementation legislation is the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.

One of the difficulties in implementing MARPOL arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping. The country that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify a ship&#x27;s compliance with international standards and can detain the ship if it finds significant noncompliance. When incidents occur outside such country&#x27;s jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined, the country refers cases to flag states, in accordance with MARPOL. A 2000 US GAO report documented that even when referrals have been made, the response rate from flag states has been poor.

On 1 January 2015, maritime shipping levels became legally subject to new MARPOL directives because the SECA (Sulphur Emission Controlled Areas) zone increased in size. This larger SECA zone will include the North Sea, Scandinavia, and parts of the English Channel. This area is set to include all of the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s international waters in 2020 culminating in all of Western Europe&#x27;s subjection to the MARPOL directive. This has proven controversial for shipping and ferry operators across Europe.

Concerns have been raised about the environmental damage moving back to the roads by some of the larger ferry operators that ship substantial amounts of freight and passenger traffic via these routes affected by IMO standards. They claim that MARPOL will drive up ferry costs for the consumer and freight forwarding companies pushing them back onto the European roadways as a financially more cost effective measure compared to increased ferry costs, thereby defeating the object of reducing water pollution.

==Enforcement of MARPOL Annex VI== 
Concerns have also been raised whether the emission regulation in MARPOL Annex VI, such as the 0.5% global sulphur limit, can be enforced on international waters by non-flag States, as some ships sail under a flag of convenience. It is believed that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows port States to assert jurisdiction over such violations of emission regulation (also of future regulations of GHG) when they occur on the high seas. Coastal States can assert jurisdiction over violations occurring within their waters, with certain exceptions pertaining to innocent passage and the right of transit passage. The special obligations for flag States and the broadened jurisdictions for coastal and port States, to enforce MARPOL (including Annex VI) are found within the special provisions of part XII of UNCLOS.

<text>The Revolutionary Cells – Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB), known simply as Animal Liberation Brigade (ALB), is a name used by animal liberationists who advocate the use of a diversity of tactics within the animal liberation movement, whether non-violent or not. As part of a praxis, the intention is to destroy oppressive institutions, describing an &quot;endgame&quot; for animal abusers. The Revolutionary Cells is not a group but an example of a leaderless resistance, as a banner for autonomous, covert cells who carry out direct action similar to the Animal Rights Militia (ARM).

Founded in the United States, after bombing Chiron and Shaklee&#x27;s corporate offices in 2003, activists have since used the banner to firebomb vehicles and threaten to send letter bombs to individuals in the California area. Targets have included corporate customers of animal testing laboratory Huntingdon Life Sciences and animal researchers at UCLA and the California National Primate Research Center. The FBI issued an arrest warrant for Daniel Andreas San Diego for his alleged association with the cell responsible for the 2003 bombings.

==Philosophy==
===Guidelines===
The Revolutionary Cells guidelines was posted on the &quot;Bite Back&quot; website after the second bombing:

===Who are RCALB?===

The &quot;Bite Back&quot; communique also explained who the Revolutionary Cells were and why they exist:

===Structure and aims===
The group formed the same leaderless-resistance model as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), which consists of small, autonomous, covert terror cells acting independently. A cell may consist of just one person.

According to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, the Front describes itself as &quot;an international coalition fighting injustice&quot;. The Institute&#x27;s knowledge Base describes it as an &quot;unusually violent animal-rights terrorist movement ... with a penchant for hyperbole and casting about pretensions of power and importance.&quot; Oren Segal, co-director of Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s Center on Extremism, believes the group consists of the same few &quot;lone wolves&quot; that carry out actions in the name of the ALF and Earth Liberation Front (ELF), &quot;the names are interchangeable ... they&#x27;re going to rename themselves depending on what actions they&#x27;re doing.&quot;

The existence of activists calling themselves the Revolutionary Cells or Animal Rights Militia (ARM), another name used to inflict violence, reflects a struggle within the Animal Liberation Front and the animal rights movement in general, between those who believe violence and terror tactics are justified, and those who insist the movement should reject it in favor of non-violent resistance.

===Extensional self-defense===
Steven Best has coined the term &quot;extensional self-defense&quot; to describe actions carried out in defense of animals by human beings acting as &quot;proxy agents.&quot; He argues that, in carrying out acts of extensional self-defense, activists have the moral right to engage in acts of sabotage or even violence. Extensional self-defense is justified, he writes, because animals are &quot;so vulnerable and oppressed they cannot fight back to attack or kill their oppressors.&quot; Best argues that the principle of extensional self-defense mirrors the penal code statues known as the &quot;necessity defense,&quot; which can be invoked when a defendant believes that the illegal act was necessary to avoid imminent and great harm. He also argues that is not just a theory, but policy in some African countries where governments hire armed soldiers to protect endangered wildlife from poachers who wish to sell their body parts in international markets:

&quot;Pacifists cannot stop poachers, but bullets can, and while many measures must be taken to protect endangered species, right now armed soldiers are the best protection rhinos and elephants have against murderous, weapon-wielding poachers.&quot;

In testimony to the Senate in 2005, Jerry Vlasak stated that he regarded violence against Huntingdon Life Sciences as an example of extensional self-defense.

==Actions==
===Pipe bombs===
The RCALB took credit for its first action on 27 August 2003, when two &quot;pipe bombs filled with an ammonium nitrate&quot; were placed at Chiron Corporation&#x27;s offices in Emeryville, California. Both devices were packed with nails to act as shrapnel. Chiron was targeted because of a contract with Huntingdon Life Sciences, a New Jersey–based animal testing contractor. A group calling itself &quot;Revolutionary Cells of the Animal Liberation Brigade&quot; e-mailed a statement to reporters taking credit for the bombing which was also sent to the &quot;Bite Back&quot; website. One of the bombs exploded an hour after the first, although no casualties resulted from the second blast, as the second device was discovered and the area cleared before the explosion.

===Office bombing===
In September 2003, the RCALB took responsibility for another bombing, this time at the offices of Shaklee Inc. in Pleasanton, California. Shaklee was targeted because its parent company, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, does business with HLS. The attackers are said to be linked to Daniel Andreas San Diego, who was featured on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; and has been placed on the FBI&#x27;s most wanted terrorists list. A statement was again released from the group to &quot;Bite Back&quot; this time also including their manifesto. It was thought the bomb was this intended to cause harm, as nails flew out &quot;at a speed of 100 miles an hour&quot;, although again no one was harmed.

===Incendiary device===
On 24 June 2007, an explosive device was placed under a car belonging to Arthur Rosenbaum, a pediatric ophthalmologist who carries out animal experimentation with cats and rhesus monkeys at the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA. The device failed to explode because of a faulty fuse, but was still claimed by the Animal Liberation Brigade who called for &quot;an end to systematic violence and oppression&quot;. UCLA offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the bomber. Then acting Chancellor, Norman Abrams, said the university &quot;remains steadfast in its commitment to the lawful use of laboratory animals in research for the benefit of society.&quot;

===Letter bombs===
Although no suspicious packages have yet been found, RCALB claimed in January 2009 to &quot;Indybay&quot; that they sent two UC Davis animal researchers letter bombs because of their work at the California National Primate Research Center. One of the researchers targeted said, &quot;It worries me a little bit ... I mean, anytime someone threatens you physically I think it causes worry.&quot; The Animal Liberation Brigade said in a communique re-released by the Animal Liberation Press Office that the act was not a hoax, with officials at the primate center claiming threats and protests have happened before and were unacceptable.

===Vehicle firebombed===
In the early hours of 7 March 2009, the Animal Liberation Brigade once again targeted UCLA. This time setting ablaze and destroying a car belonging to researcher J. David Jentsch. The UCLA Chancellor described the latest attack as &quot;reprehensible&quot;, with the University raising the reward for information leading to the arrest of the activists to nearly $500,000.

<doc id="308353" wikidata="Q6942292" url="?curid=308353" title="Music of Tennessee">
<text>The story of Tennessee&#x27;s contribution to American music is essentially the story of three cities: Nashville, Memphis, and Bristol. While Nashville is most famous for its status as the long-time capital of country music, Bristol is recognized as the &quot;Birthplace of Country Music&quot;. Memphis musicians have had an enormous influence on blues, early rock and roll, R&amp;B, and soul music, as well as an increasing presence in rap.

== Bristol: &quot;Birthplace of Country Music&quot; ==
Bristol is best known for being the site of the first commercial recordings of country music, showcasing Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, and later a favorite venue of mountain musician Uncle Charlie Osborne. Bristol is also the birthplace of Tennessee Ernie Ford.

In 1927, Ralph Peer of Victor Records began recording local musicians in Bristol to capture the local sound of traditional “folk” music of the region. One of these local sounds was created by the Carter Family. The Carter Family got their start on July 31, 1927, when A.P. Carter and his family journeyed from Maces Spring, Virginia, to Bristol, Tennessee, to audition for record producer Ralph Peer who was seeking new talent for the relatively embryonic recording industry. They received $50 for each song they recorded.

The U.S. Congress recognized Bristol as the “Birthplace of Country Music” in 1998 for its contributions to early country music recordings and ongoing influence.

== Nashville: &quot;Music City, U.S.A.&quot; ==
Nashville, the most populous city and metropolitan area in the state, is home to the Grand Ole Opry (est. 1925) and the Country Music Hall of Fame (est. 1967), and bears the nickname &quot;Music City, U.S.A.&quot;.

In a tour of Great Britain and Europe in 1873, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, the first former slaves to tour Europe after the Civil War, performed the spirituals &quot;Steal Away to Jesus&quot; and &quot;Go Down, Moses&quot; for Queen Victoria in April. According to local oral tradition, Queen Victoria was so impressed by the Singers that she commented that with such beautiful voices, they had to be from the Music City of the United States. Hence, the moniker for Nashville, Tennessee – Music City USA – was born. They returned to Europe the following year, touring from May 1875 to July 1878. This tour raised an estimated $150,000 for the university, funds used to construct Fisk&#x27;s first permanent building. Named Jubilee Hall, the building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 and still stands.

Ryman Auditorium, opened in 1892, is a world-famous music venue in downtown Nashville, known for hosting the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; from 1943 to 1974 and &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot; from 1969 to 1971.

WSM (AM) signed on in 1925, the same year launching &quot;WSM Barndance&quot; soon known as &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. The weekly stage show and broadcast would play an important role in the popularization of country music and is today the longest running radio program in the world.

By the late 1950s, the city&#x27;s record labels dominated the country music genre with slick pop-country (&quot;Nashville sound&quot;), overtaking honky-tonk in the charts. Performers reacting against the Nashville sound formed their own scenes in Lubbock, Texas and Bakersfield, California, the latter of which (&quot;Bakersfield sound&quot;) became the most popular type of country by the late 1960s, led by Merle Haggard. Progressive country and outlaw country emerged to challenge the prevailing Nashville sound. Nashville&#x27;s predominance in country music was regained by the early 1980s, when Dwight Yoakam and other neo-traditionalists entered the charts.

Even as country music became central to Nashville&#x27;s identity and music commerce, a string of clubs on Jefferson Street played host to electrifying rhythm and blues. It&#x27;s where Jimi Hendrix cut his teeth and where Etta James &#x27;Rocked The House&#x27; on her 1964 live recording from the New Era Club. Meanwhile, white and black met in Printer&#x27;s Alley, where Music Row studio musicians gathered at day&#x27;s end to play jazz and rock and roll. Nashville&#x27;s WLAC radio was a vital source for R&amp;B from the mid-1940s through the 1960s. The 2004 compilation album &quot;Night Train to Nashville&quot;, spawned by an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame, showcased and celebrated this history.

In 1966, Bob Dylan released his landmark &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; album, primarily recorded in Nashville, assisted by local session musicians the Nashville Cats by suggestion of producer Bob Johnston. The album&#x27;s success helped transform Nashville&#x27;s conservative music reputation and artists including Simon and Garfunkel and Leonard Cohen soon followed to record there with Johnston. Dylan continued his relationship with the city on 1967&#x27;s &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; and 1969&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;.

Exit/In is a long-time Nashville club, opened in 1971, having played host to many rock legends and locals including Jason &amp; the Scorchers and featured in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot;.

Lucy&#x27;s Record Shop was an independent, locally owned record store and all-ages music venue in Nashville in the 1990s. During its five and a half years of operation, Lucy&#x27;s supported a growing punk and indie music scene in Nashville, and even received national notoriety as a prominent underground music venue. Lambchop played some of their first shows at Lucy&#x27;s.

Outsider music greats from Nashville include R. Stevie Moore and Dave Cloud.

Today, there is still a thriving country music scene in Nashville, however there are other scenes and genres gaining in outside attention, such as indie, rock, and metalcore. Infinity Cat Recordings, home of JEFF the Brotherhood and Be Your Own Pet, and Jack White&#x27;s Third Man Records are prime examples. Dolly Parton, &quot;the Queen of Country&quot; and owner of Dollywood, had 2 #1 Hot 100 hits, including &quot;9 to 5&quot; in 1981. In pop music, Kesha from Nashville has had 3 #1 Hot 100 hits on the Billboard charts, including &quot;Tik Tok&quot; in 2009. Miley Cyrus from Franklin has had 2 #1 Hot 100 hits like &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Flowers&quot; in 2023. The pop punk band Paramore, also from Franklin and fronted by Hayley Williams, had a #1 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with &quot;Paramore&quot; in 2013. Country superstar Kenny Chesney from Knoxville has had 8 #1 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 from 2002 to 2020 like &quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot; in 2004. Chesney graduated from East Tennessee State University in 1990. Lady Antebellum from Nashville had 3 #1 albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 including &quot;Need You Now&quot; in 2010. Hillary Scott attended Middle Tennessee State University. The Civil Wars, an Americana and folk duo, also had a #1 album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2013. Country and R&amp;B singer Kane Brown from Chattanooga had a #1 album in 2018. Morgan Wallen from the Knoxville area has had 2 #1 albums like &quot;&quot; in 2021, and he had the long running #1 Hot 100 &quot;Last Night&quot; in 2023. Judah &amp; the Lion and Moon Taxi are popular bands from Nashville, and members from both bands attended Belmont University.

== Murfreesboro ==
Murfreesboro hosts several music-oriented events annually, such as the Main Street Jazzfest presented by MTSU&#x27;s School of Music and the Main Street Association each May. For over 30 years, Uncle Dave Macon Days has celebrated the musical tradition of Uncle Dave Macon. This annual July event includes national competitions for old-time music and dancing.

Because of Middle Tennessee State University&#x27;s large recording industry program, the city has fostered a number of bands and songwriters, including: A Plea for Purging, Self, Fluid Ounces, The Katies, The Features, Count Bass D, The Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza, Destroy Destroy Destroy, De Novo Dahl, The Protomen, and Those Darlins. Several notable musicians have attended or graduated from MTSU, including Julien Baker, Sharon Van Etten, George S. Clinton, Hardy, Tay Keith, Lecrae, Amy Lee, and Hillary Scott.

Spongebath Records was a key force in the Murfreesboro indie music scene in the late 1990s.

== Old-time music ==

The state of Tennessee once had a strong Old-time music tradition. In its earliest days the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; featured banjo players, fiddle players, and string bands from Middle Tennessee such as Uncle Jimmy Thompson, Uncle Dave Macon, Fiddlin&#x27; Arthur Smith, Sid Harkreader, the McGee Brothers, Humphrey Bate and his Possum Hunters, Binkley Brothers&#x27; Dixie Clodhoppers, the Gully Jumpers, the Fruit Jar Drinkers, and The Crook Brothers String Band. East Tennessee old-time artists include Clarence Ashley, Charlie Bowman, Uncle Am Stuart, Theron Hale, Curly Fox, and G. B. Grayson.

Tennessee also has a strong history of Appalachian ballad singers. Collectors like Cecil Sharp, Artus Moser, C P Cambiaire, Edwin Kirkland, Lillian Crabtree, and George Boswell all included TN ballads in their collections. Notable TN ballad singers include Dee and Delta Hicks, Carmen McCord Hicks, May Ray, Tillman Cadle, Sam Harmon, J B Cantrell, Marianna Schaupp, Linnie Johnson and Jesse Robinson, and Jeff Stockton.

== Blues ==
=== Memphis blues ===
Memphis&#x27; most significant musical claims to fame are as &quot;Home of the Blues&quot; and &quot;Birthplace of Rock and Roll&quot;. The African-American composer, W.C. Handy, is said to have written the first commercially successful blues song, &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, in a bar on Beale Street in 1912. Handy resided in Memphis from 1909 through 1917. He also wrote &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot;. Memphis blues is a regional style created by area musicians such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Furry Lewis, Memphis Minnie, and Memphis Jug Band in the 1910s-1930s, with stylistic origins in Country blues and Delta blues.

Memphis was a center of blues music for much of the 20th century. Pianist and singer Booker T. Laury was born in Memphis in 1914 and Blues Hall of Famers Johnny Shines and Memphis Slim were born there in 1915. During the 1940s and 1950s, Memphis was the home of B. B. King, Bobby Bland, Rosco Gordon, Junior Parker, Johnny Ace, Willie Nix, and Joe Hill Louis.  Duke Records was started in Memphis in 1952. Also in 1952, Sam Phillips started Sun Records, an early rock and roll and electric blues label. Among the artists who made some of their recordings on Sun were Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Ike Turner, Carl Perkins, and Charlie Rich.

=== Country blues ===

Country blues is one of the earliest types of blues. Country blues artists from Tennessee include Memphis Jug Band, The Two Poor Boys, Howard Armstrong, Yank Rachell, Sleepy John Estes, Hammie Nixon, Son Bonds, Noah Lewis, DeFord Bailey, John Henry Barbee, Memphis Willie B., Hattie Hart, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Brownie McGhee, Blind James Campbell, Hambone Willie Newbern, Sonny Boy Williamson I, and Terry Garland.

== Jazz ==
Memphis-born jazz artists include clarinetist Buster Bailey, singers Alberta Hunter, Eden Atwood, Dee Dee Bridgewater, violinist Erskine Tate, bassists Moses Allen, Jamil Nasser, trumpeters Booker Little, Louis Smith, Johnny Dunn, Marvin Stamm, pianists Lil Hardin Armstrong, Harold Mabern, Phineas Newborn, Jr., Rozelle Claxton, Jimmy Jones, James Williams, alto saxophonists Frank Strozier, Sonny Criss, saxophonists George Coleman, Hank Crawford, Charles Lloyd, Ben Branch, Ben Smith, Garnett Brown, Frank Lowe, Kirk Whalum, drummers Jimmy Crawford and Tony Reedus, and guitarist Abu Talib. In addition, legendary band leader Jimmy Lunceford is closely associated with Memphis due to the influential jazz orchestra he formed in the late 1920s in that city.

Legendary blues singer Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, and busked its streets with her brother as a young girl. Double bassist Jimmy Blanton, member of Duke Ellington&#x27;s band, pianist Lovie Austin, trumpeter and singer Valaida Snow, multi-instrumentalist and composer Yusef Lateef, and saxophonist Bennie Wallace were also born in Chattanooga. The city is immortalized in the 1941 big band swing song &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot;.

Trumpeter Doc Cheatham was born in Nashville. Singer Joyce Cobb was born in Oklahoma, but raised in Nashville. Bandleader and vocalist Anna Mae Winburn was born in Port Royal. Pianist Phineas Newborn, Jr. and his brother guitarist Calvin Newborn were from Whiteville. Saxophonist Sam Taylor was born in Lexington. Alto saxophonist Charles Williams was born in Halls. Trombonist Dicky Wells was born in Centerville. Trombonist Jimmy Cleveland was born in Wartrace. Pianist Johnny Maddox was born in Gallatin. Vocalist King Pleasure was born in Oakdale.

Current large jazz orchestras from Tennessee that have notable recordings are the Jazz Orchestra of the Delta (Memphis), the Memphis Jazz Orchestra, the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra, the Nashville Jazz Orchestra, the Duffy Jackson Big Band (Nashville), Tyler Mire Big Band (Nashville), and the Music City Big Band (Nashville).

== R&amp;B, soul, and funk==
R&amp;B singers Big Maybelle and Luther Ingram were born in Jackson. Tina Turner was born in Nutbush. Clifford Curry was born in Knoxville. Willie Mabon was born in Memphis. Koko Taylor was born in Shelby County. Roscoe Shelton was born in Lynchburg. Saxophonist and bandleader Paul Williams was born in Lewisburg. Drummer Clyde Stubblefield was born in Chattanooga. Arthur Gunter, Bobby Hebb, and Jackie Shane were born in Nashville. Excello Records was based in Nashville.

=== Memphis soul ===

In the 1960s and 1970s, the city was home to Hi and Stax Records, soul music record labels. Stax put out funky, distinctly Southern records by artists such as Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Wilson Pickett, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, William Bell, Wendy Rene, The Temprees, and The Bar-Kays; that stood in sharp contrast to the smoother, more pop records coming out of Detroit&#x27;s Motown. Isaac Hayes born in Covington, was an in-house producer and songwriter at Stax. His &quot;Theme from Shaft&quot; was a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1971. David Porter was a staff songwriter.

Hi Records&#x27; peak was in the early 1970s, due to the highly creative work of Al Green, whose hits on the label included &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love with You&quot;, and &quot;Call Me&quot;. Other artists on the label, including O. V. Wright, Don Bryant, Otis Clay, and Ann Peebles released soul singles or albums. Goldwax Records introduced James Carr, Spencer Wiggins, and the Ovations.

Funk Band, Ebonee Webb, released &quot;Something About You&quot; which peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/ hip-Hop charts on December 5, 1981.

Justin Timberlake &quot;the Prince of Pop&quot; from Memphis has had 4 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits in the R&amp;B genre, including &quot;SexyBack&quot; in 2006 and &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Feeling&quot; in 2016.

== Punk rock and hardcore ==
Punk rock has had active scenes in Tennessee, such as the scenes in Nashville, Knoxville, and Memphis&#x27;s River City Hardcore scene in the 1980s and 1990s. A few hardcore punk bands gained a following, including His Hero Is Gone (Memphis), Nashville&#x27;s Love Is Red, From Ashes Rise, and Committee for Public Safety, and Knoxville&#x27;s Johnny Five, The Malignmen, The Splinters and STD.

Knoxville&#x27;s punk scene began in the late 1970s with Terry Hill&#x27;s Balboa, and took off in the early 1980s with bands such as the Five Twins, The Real Hostages, Candy Creme and the Wet Dream, and the hardcore bands Koro and UXB. During that era the scene was based in a series of short-lived nightclubs such as The Place, Hobos, Uncle Sam&#x27;s, and Bundulees. Later in the 1980s several Knoxville bands such as the Judybats and Smokin&#x27; Dave and the Premo Dopes emerged to wider acclaim not limited to the local Knoxville scene. The scene again reached a peak during the mid-1990s, at that time tied closely to The Mercury Theatre, a popular all-ages venue where many Knoxville bands, such as Superdrag, got their start. After the close of the Mercury, another venue, The Neptune, opened for a short time under the same management. In 2004, Paramore originated out of Franklin.

The early 1970s power pop band Big Star, cited as a primary influence by many grunge and alternative rock groups since, was from Memphis. Memphis-based Goner Records, founded in 1993, has released artists including Oblivians, Reigning Sound, and Jay Reatard. Indie rock singer Julien Baker was active in the Memphis hardcore scene as a teenager, and continues to collaborate with punk and hardcore bands.

== Gospel and Christian music ==
Tennessee&#x27;s location in the Bible Belt has led to an active southern Gospel music scene with such groups as The LeFevres, as well as being the origin of some notable Christian rock bands such as Memphis&#x27;s DeGarmo and Key. The country group the Oak Ridge Boys started in 1945 as the Oak Ridge Quartet, a Southern Gospel group based in Knoxville who performed for workers at the nearby Oak Ridge facilities during World War II.

An African American a cappella ensemble, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, consisting of students at Fisk University in Nashville have been performing since 1871. The Fairfield Four started in Nashville and have existed since 1921.

<text>Manuel Blum (born 26 April 1938) is a Venezuelan born American computer scientist who received the Turing Award in 1995 &quot;In recognition of his contributions to the foundations of computational complexity theory and its application to cryptography and program checking&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1145/321386.321395&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Blum was born to a Jewish family in Venezuela. Blum was educated at MIT, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree and his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1959 and 1961 respectively. In MIT, he was recommended to Warren S. McCulloch, and they collaborated on some mathematical problems in neural networks. He obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1964 supervised by Marvin Minsky.

==Career==
Blum worked as a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley until 2001. From 2001 to 2018, he was the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where his wife, Lenore Blum, was also a professor of Computer Science.

In 2002, he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 2006, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to abstract complexity theory, inductive inference, cryptographic protocols, and the theory and applications of program checkers.

In 2018 he and his wife Lenore resigned from Carnegie Mellon University to protest against sexism after a change in management structure of Project Olympus led to sexist treatment of her as director and the exclusion of other women from project activities.

==Research==

In the 60s he developed an axiomatic complexity theory which was independent of concrete machine models. The theory is based on Gödel numberings and the Blum axioms. Even though the theory is not based on any machine model it yields concrete results like the compression theorem, the gap theorem, the honesty theorem and the Blum speedup theorem.

Some of his other work includes a protocol for flipping a coin over a telephone, median of medians (a linear time selection algorithm), the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, the Blum–Goldwasser cryptosystem, and more recently CAPTCHAs.

Blum is also known as the advisor of many prominent researchers. Among his Ph.D. students are Leonard Adleman, Dana Angluin, Shafi Goldwasser, Mor Harchol-Balter, Russell Impagliazzo, Silvio Micali, Gary Miller, Moni Naor, Steven Rudich, Michael Sipser, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Umesh Vazirani, Vijay Vazirani, Luis von Ahn, and Ryan Williams.

<text>The Howard Families are a fictional group of people created by the author Robert A. Heinlein.

According to Heinlein, the Howard Foundation was started in the 19th century by Ira Howard, a millionaire dying of old age in his forties, for the purpose of extending human lifespan. Howard himself did not live to see the outcome; he simply endowed the experiment with his own fortune, and the trustees of the Howard Foundation used the limited scientific knowledge of the time to create a selective human breeding program to encourage, financially, people of long-lived ancestry to have children together. The Howard Foundation is greatly enriched during the Great Depression by knowledge gained through time travel so that they get out of the stock market before the crash and invest in gold rather than cash and are able to reinvest in stocks that rebound after the crash.

The novel &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; is focused on the Howard Families and their quest for acceptance on Earth and other planets. According to &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot;, envy of the Howard Families and the false belief that they have some artificial secret to long life eventually leads the &quot;short-lifers&quot; to develop a therapy for &quot;rejuvenation&quot;. Initially, the therapy consists simply of blood replacement (using new blood grown &quot;in vitro&quot;), but according to &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot;, this single therapy was eventually expanded to include the gradual replacement of nearly all body parts as well as emotional therapy. Members of the Howard Families generally opt to undergo rejuvenation, thereby extending their already-long lifespans practically indefinitely.

The books &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; and &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot; tell the stories of two famous Howard Family members: Lazarus Long, and his mother Maureen Johnson. Lazarus Long also appears in &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;.
