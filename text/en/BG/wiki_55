<text>CP/CMS (Control Program/Cambridge Monitor System) is a discontinued time-sharing operating system of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is known for its excellent performance and advanced features. Among its three versions, CP-40/CMS was an important &#x27;one-off&#x27; research system that established the CP/CMS virtual machine architecture. It was followed by CP-67/CMS, a reimplementation of CP-40/CMS for the IBM System/360-67, and the primary focus of this article. Finally, CP-370/CMS was a reimplementation of CP-67/CMS for the System/370. While it was never released as such, it became the foundation of IBM&#x27;s VM/370 operating system, announced in 1972.

Each implementation was a substantial redesign of its predecessor and an evolutionary step forward. CP-67/CMS was the first widely available virtual machine architecture. IBM pioneered this idea with its research systems M44/44X (which used partial virtualization) and CP-40 (which used full virtualization).

In addition to its role as the predecessor of the VM family, CP/CMS played an important role in the development of operating system (OS) theory, the design of IBM&#x27;s System/370, the time-sharing industry, and the creation of a self-supporting user community that anticipated today&#x27;s free software movement.

==History==
Fundamental CP/CMS architectural and strategic parameters were established in CP-40, which began production use at IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center in early 1967. This effort occurred in a complex political and technical &quot;milieu&quot;, discussed at some length and supported by first-hand quotes in the Wikipedia article History of CP/CMS.

In a nutshell:

* In the early 1960s, IBM sought to maintain dominance over scientific computing, where time-sharing efforts such as CTSS and MIT&#x27;s Project MAC gained focus. But IBM had committed to a huge project, the System/360, which took the company in a different direction.
* The time-sharing community was disappointed with the S/360&#x27;s lack of time-sharing capabilities. This led to key IBM sales losses at Project MAC and Bell Laboratories. IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center (CSC), originally established to support Project MAC, began an effort to regain IBM&#x27;s credibility in time-sharing, by building a time-sharing operating system for the S/360. This system would eventually become CP/CMS. In the same spirit, IBM designed and released a S/360 model with time-sharing features, the IBM System/360-67, and a time-sharing operating system, TSS/360. TSS failed; but the 360-67 and CP/CMS succeeded, despite internal political battles over time-sharing, and concerted efforts at IBM to scrap the CP/CMS effort.
* In 1967, CP/CMS production use began, first on CSC&#x27;s CP-40, then later on CP-67 at Lincoln Laboratories and other sites. It was made available via the IBM Type-III Library in 1968. By 1972, CP/CMS had gone through several releases; it was a robust, stable system running on 44 systems; it could support 60 timesharing users on a S/360-67; and at least two commercial timesharing vendors (National CSS and IDC) were reselling S/360-67 time using CP/CMS technology.
* In 1972, IBM announced the addition of virtual memory to the S/370 series, along with the VM/370 operating system, a reimplementation of CP/CMS for the S/370. This marked the end of CP/CMS releases, although the system continued its independent existence for some time. VM releases continued to include source code for some time and members of the VM community long remained active contributors.

==Overview==

CP/CMS was built by IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center (CSC), a research and development lab with ties to MIT, under the leadership of Robert Creasy. The system&#x27;s goals, development process, release, and legacy of breakthrough technology, set this system apart from other operating systems of its day and from other large IBM projects. It was an open-source system, made available in source code form to all IBM customers at no charge – as part of the unsupported IBM Type-III Library. CP/CMS users supported themselves and each other. Unusual circumstances, described in the History section below, led to this situation.

CP/CMS consisted of two main components:

* CP, the &quot;Control Program&quot;, created the virtual machine environment. The widely used version was CP-67, ran on the S/360-67. (The research system CP-40 established the architecture. A third version, CP-370, became VM/370.) Instead of explicitly dividing up memory and other resources among users, which had been the traditional approach, CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Each system was able to run any S/360 software that ran on the bare machine and in effect gave each user a private computer system.
* CMS, the &quot;Cambridge Monitor System&quot; (and also &quot;Console Monitor System&quot; – but renamed Conversational Monitor System in VM) was a lightweight single-user operating system, for interactive time-sharing use. By running many copies of CMS in CP&#x27;s virtual machines – instead of multiple copies of large, traditional multi-tasking OS – the overhead per user was less. This allowed a great number of simultaneous users to share a single S/360.

The CP/CMS virtual machine concept was an important step forward in operating system design.

* By isolating users from each other, CP/CMS greatly improved system reliability and security.
* By simulating a full, stand-alone computer for each user, CP/CMS could run &quot;any&quot; S/360 software in a time-sharing environment, not just applications specifically designed for time-sharing.
* By using lightweight CMS as the primary user interface, CP/CMS achieved unprecedented time-sharing performance. In addition, the simplicity of CMS made it easier to implement user interface enhancements than in traditional OS.

IBM reimplemented CP/CMS as its VM/370 product line, released in 1972 when virtual memory was added to the S/370 series. VM/370&#x27;s successors (such as z/VM) remain in wide use today. (IBM reimplemented CP-67, as it had CP-40, and did not simply rename and repackage it. VM coexisted with CP/CMS and its successors for many years. It is thus appropriate to view CP/CMS as an independent OS, distinct from the VM family.)

==CP/CMS as free software==
CP/CMS was distributed in source code form, and many CP/CMS users were actively involved in studying and modifying that source code. Such direct user involvement with a vendor-supplied operating system was unusual.

In the CP/CMS era, many vendors distributed operating systems in machine-readable source code. IBM provided optional source code for, e.g., OS/360, DOS/360, and several later mainstream IBM operating systems. With all these systems, some awareness of system source code was also involved in the SYSGEN process, comparable to a kernel build in modern systems also in installing a Starter Set. (Forty years later, the Hercules emulator can be used to run fossilized versions of these systems, based on source code that is now treated as part of the public domain.)

The importance of operating system source code has changed over time. Before IBM unbundled software from hardware in 1969, the OS (and most other software) was included in the cost of the hardware. Each vendor had complete responsibility for the entire system, hardware and software. This made the distribution medium relatively unimportant. After IBM&#x27;s unbundling, OS software was delivered as IBM System Control Program software IBM System Control Program (SCP) software, eventually in object code only (OCO) form.

For complicated reasons, CP/CMS was not released in the normal way. It was not supported by IBM, but was made part of the unsupported IBM Type-III Library, a collection of software contributions from IBM staff members (similarly software contributed by customers formed the Type-IV Library). IBM distributed this library to its customers for use &#x27;as is&#x27;. The lack of direct IBM support for such products forced active users to support themselves and encouraged modifications and mutual support. CP/CMS and other Type-III products were early forms of free software.

Source code distribution of other IBM operating systems may have continued for some time (e.g. OS/360, DOS/360, DOS/VSE, MVS, and even TSS/370, which all today are generally considered to be in the public domain) since they were arguably published without a copyright notice before 1978.} However, the unsupported status of CP/CMS placed different pressures on its user community and created the need for source code distribution.

CP/CMS was contributed to the Type-III Library by MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory and &quot;not&quot; by IBM, despite the fact that the system was built by IBM&#x27;s Cambridge Scientific Center. This decision has been described as a form of collusion to outmaneuver the IBM political forces opposed to time-sharing. It is thought that it may also reflect the amount of formal and informal input from MIT and Union Carbide that contributed to the design and implementation of CP-40, the S/360-67, CP-67, and CMS. See History of CP/CMS (historical notes) for further insights and references on this topic.

Many CP/CMS users made extensive modifications to their own copies of the source code. Much of this work was shared among sites, and important changes found their way back into the core system. Other users, such as National CSS and some academic sites, continued independent development of CP/CMS, rather than switching to VM/370 when it became available. These efforts diverged from the community, in what today would be termed a software fork.

After IBM released VM/370, source code distribution of VM continued for several releases. (The VM project did not adopt the use of PL/S, an internal systems programming language mandated for use within IBM on many comparable projects. The use of PL/S would have made source code distribution impossible. IBM attempted to turn away from assembly language to higher level languages as early as 1965, and was making substantial use of PL/S by 1969, e.g. in MVS. PL/S was considered a trade secret at the time and was not available to customers. IBM apparently made exceptions to this policy much later.) The VM user community continued to make important contributions to the software, as it had during the CP/CMS Type-III period. Few OS or DOS sites exhibited active user involvement in deep operating system internals, but this was found at many VM sites. This reverse support helped CP/CMS concepts survive and evolve, despite VM&#x27;s second class citizen status at IBM.

==Architecture==
The CP/CMS architecture was revolutionary for its time. The system consisted of a virtualizing control program (CP) which created multiple independent virtual machines (VMs). Platform virtualization was possible because of two elements of the IBM System/360-67:
* Segregation of privileged &quot;supervisor state&quot; instructions from normal &quot;problem state&quot; instructions
* Address translation hardware
When a program was running in &quot;problem state,&quot; using a privileged instruction or an invalid memory address would cause the hardware to raise an exception condition. By trapping these conditions, CP could simulate the appropriate behavior, e.g. performing I/O or paging operations. A guest operating system, which would run in &quot;supervisor state&quot; on a bare machine, was run in &quot;problem state&quot; under CP.

The result was a fully virtualized environment. Each virtual machine had its own set of virtual devices, mapped from the system&#x27;s real hardware environment. Thus a given dial-up teletype was presented to its VM instance as its &quot;virtual console&quot;.

Note that, in CP-67, certain model-dependent and diagnostic instructions were not virtualized, notably the DIAG instruction. Ultimately, in later development at IBM and elsewhere, DIAG instructions were used to create a non-virtualized interface, to what became called a hypervisor. Client operating systems could use this mechanism to communicate directly with the control program; this offered dramatic performance improvements.

Any S/360 operating system could in fact be run under CP, but normal users ran Cambridge Monitor System (CMS), a simple, single-user operating system. CMS allowed users to run programs and manage their virtual devices. CP-67 versions 1 and 2 did not support virtual memory inside a virtual machine. This was added in version 3. At that point, testing and development of CP itself could be done by running a full copy of CP/CMS inside a single virtual machine. Some CP/CMS operating system work, such as CP-370 development and MVS testing, ran four- or five-level deep stacks of hardware and OS simulations.

The CP/CMS design is different from IBM&#x27;s previous monolithic operating systems, it separates complex &quot;big system&quot; (dispatching, hardware management, mass storage) from &quot;little system&quot; (application program execution, file I/O, console input/output). The re-categorization of both systems into their own entities prevents a bug in one users&#x27; system from affecting both. This is a model feature in microkernel operating systems.

IBM&#x27;s decision to implement virtualization and virtual memory features in the subsequent S/370 design (although missing from the initial S/370 series) reflects, at least in part, the success of the CP/CMS approach. In turn the survival and success of IBM&#x27;s VM operating system family, and of virtualization technology in general, owe much to the S/360-67.

In many respects, IBM&#x27;s CP-67 and CP/CMS products anticipated (and heavily influenced) contemporary virtualization software, such as VMware Workstation, Xen, and Microsoft Virtual PC.

==Related terminology==
*CP: &quot;Control Program&quot;. CP-40 and CP-67 were implementations for CSC&#x27;s customized S/360-40 and the standard S/360-67, respectively.
*CMS: &quot;Cambridge Monitor System&quot;. This portion of the CP/CMS system was renamed Conversational Monitor System when IBM released VM/370. Unlike the CP-to-VM transition, however, which was a reimplementation, much of CMS was moved without modification from CP/CMS into VM/370.
*VM: &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, initially the term &quot;pseudo-machine&quot; was used, but soon &quot;virtual machine&quot; was borrowed from the IBM M44/44X project. It was well established in CP/CMS by the time IBM introduced VM/370.
*hypervisor: a mechanism for paravirtualization. This term was coined in IBM&#x27;s reimplementation of CP-67 as VM/370.

<text>The Panama Canal Zone (), also simply known as the Canal Zone, was a concession of the United States located in the Isthmus of Panama that existed from 1903 to 1979. It consisted of the Panama Canal and an area generally extending on each side of the centerline, but excluding Panama City and Colón. Its capital was Balboa. 

The Panama Canal Zone was created on November 18, 1903 from the territory of Panama; it was established with the signing of the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which allowed for the construction of the Panama Canal within the territory by the United States. The zone existed until October 1, 1979, when it was incorporated back into Panama.

In 1904, the Isthmian Canal Convention was proclaimed. In it, the Republic of Panama granted to the United States in perpetuity the use, occupation, and control of a zone of land and land underwater for the construction, maintenance, operation, sanitation, and protection of the canal. From 1903 to 1979, the territory was controlled by the United States, which had purchased the land from its private and public owners, built the canal and financed its construction. The Canal Zone was abolished in 1979, as a term of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties two years earlier; the canal itself was later under joint U.S.–Panamanian control until it was fully turned over to Panama in 1999.

==History==

===Proposals for a canal===
Proposals for a canal across the Isthmus of Panama date back to 1529, soon after the Spanish conquest. Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón, a lieutenant of conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa, suggested four possible routes, one of which closely tracks the present-day canal. Saavedra believed that such a canal would make it easier for European vessels to reach Asia. Although King Charles I was enthusiastic and ordered preliminary works started, his officials in Panama soon realized that such an undertaking was beyond the capabilities of 16th-century technology. One official wrote to Charles, &quot;I pledge to Your Majesty that there is not a prince in the world with the power to accomplish this&quot;. The Spanish instead built a road across the isthmus. The road came to be crucial to Spain&#x27;s economy, as treasure obtained along the Pacific coast of South America was offloaded at Panama City and hauled through the jungle to the Atlantic port of Nombre de Dios, close to present-day Colón. Although additional canal building proposals were made throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, they came to naught.

The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw a number of canals built. The success of the Erie Canal in the United States and the collapse of the Spanish Empire in Hispanic America led to a surge of American interest in building an interoceanic canal. Beginning in 1826, US officials began negotiations with Gran Colombia (present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama), hoping to gain a concession for the building of a canal. Jealous of their newly obtained independence and fearing that they would be dominated by an American presence, the president Simón Bolívar and New Granada officials declined American offers. The new nation was politically unstable, and Panama rebelled several times during the 19th century.

In 1836, U.S. statesman Charles Biddle reached an agreement with the New Granadan government to replace the old road with an improved one or a railroad, running from Panama City on the Pacific coast to the Chagres River, where a steamship service would allow passengers and freight to continue to Colón. His agreement was repudiated by the Jackson administration, which wanted rights to build a canal. In 1841, with Panama in rebellion again, British interests secured a right of way over the isthmus from the insurgent regime and occupied Nicaraguan ports that might have served as the Atlantic terminus of a canal.

In 1846, the new US envoy to Bogotá, Benjamin Bidlack, was surprised when, soon after his arrival, the New Granadans proposed that the United States be the guarantor of the neutrality of the isthmus. The resulting Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty allowed the United States to intervene militarily to ensure that the interoceanic road (and when it was built, the Panama Railroad as well) would not be disrupted. New Granada hoped that other nations would sign similar treaties, but the one with the United States, which was ratified by the US Senate in June 1848 after considerable lobbying by New Granada, was the only one.

The treaty led the U.S. government to contract for steamship service to Panama from ports on both coasts. When the California Gold Rush began in 1848, traffic through Panama greatly increased, and New Granada agreed to allow the Panama Railroad to be constructed by American interests. This first &quot;transcontinental railroad&quot; opened in 1850. There were riots in Panama City in 1856; several Americans were killed. US warships landed Marines, who occupied the railroad station and kept the railroad service from being interrupted by the unrest. The United States demanded compensation from New Granada, including a zone wide, to be governed by US officials and in which the United States might build any &quot;railway or passageway&quot; it desired. The demand was dropped in the face of resistance by New Granadan officials, who accused the United States of seeking a colony.

Through the remainder of the 19th century, the United States landed troops several times to preserve the railway connection. At the same time, it pursued a canal treaty with Colombia (as New Granada was renamed). One treaty, signed in 1868, was rejected by the Colombian Senate, which hoped for better terms from the incoming Grant administration. Under this treaty, the canal would have been in the middle of a 20-mile zone, under American management but Colombian sovereignty, and the canal would revert to Colombia in 99 years. The Grant administration did little to pursue a treaty and, in 1878, the concession to build the canal fell to a French firm. The French efforts eventually failed, but with Panama apparently unavailable, the United States considered possible canal sites in Mexico and Nicaragua.

The Spanish–American War of 1898 added new life to the canal debate. During the war, American warships in the Atlantic seeking to reach battle zones in the Pacific had been forced to round Cape Horn. Influential naval pundits, such as Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, urged the construction of a Central American canal. In 1902, with the French efforts moribund, US president Theodore Roosevelt backed the Panama route, and Congress passed legislation authorizing him to purchase the French assets on the condition that an agreement was reached with Colombia. 

In March 1902, Colombia set its terms for such a treaty: Colombia was to be sovereign over the canal, which would be policed by Colombians paid for by the United States. The host nation would receive a larger percentage of the tolls than provided for in earlier draft treaties. The draft terms were quickly rejected by American officials.

Roosevelt was in a hurry to secure the treaty; the Colombians, to whom the French property would revert in 1904, were not. Negotiations dragged on into 1903, during which time there was unrest in Panama City and Colón; the United States sent in Marines to guard the trains. Nevertheless, in early 1903, the United States and Colombia signed a treaty which, despite Colombia&#x27;s previous objections, gave the United States a wide zone in which it could deploy troops with Colombian consent. On August 12, 1903, the Colombian Senate voted down the treaty 24–0.

Roosevelt was angered by the Colombians&#x27; actions, especially when the Colombian Senate made a counteroffer that was more financially advantageous to Colombia. A Frenchman who had worked on his nation&#x27;s canal efforts, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, represented Panamanian insurgents; he met with Roosevelt and with Secretary of State John Hay, who saw to it that his principals received covert support. When the revolution came in November 1903, the United States intervened to protect the rebels, who succeeded in taking over the province, declaring it independent as the Republic of Panama. Bunau-Varilla was initially the Panamanian representative in the United States, though he was about to be displaced by actual Panamanians, and hastily negotiated a treaty, giving the United States a zone wide and full authority to pass laws to govern that zone. The Panama Canal Zone (Canal Zone, or Zone) excluded Panama City and Colón, but included four offshore islands, and permitted the United States to add to the zone any additional lands needed to carry on canal operations. The Panamanians were minded to disavow the treaty, but Bunau-Varilla told the new government that if Panama did not agree, the United States would withdraw its protection and make the best terms it could with Colombia. The Panamanians agreed, even adding a provision to the new constitution, at US request, allowing the larger nation to intervene to preserve public order.
===Construction (1903–1914)===
The treaty was approved by the provisional Panamanian government on December 2, 1903, and by the US Senate on February 23, 1904. Under the treaty, Panama received , much of which the United States required to be invested in that country, plus annual payments of ; with those payments made, as well as for the purchase of the French company assets, the Canal Zone was formally turned over by Panama on May 4, 1904, when American officials reopened the Panama City offices of the canal company and raised the American flag. This marked the beginning point for U.S. excavation and construction which concluded in August 1914 with the opening of the canal to commercial traffic.

==Governance==

By order of President Theodore Roosevelt under the Panama Canal Acts of 1902 and 1904 the secretary of War was made supervisor of canal construction and the second Isthmian Canal Commission made the governing body for the Canal Zone. Under the Panama Canal Act of May 24, 1912, President Woodrow Wilson issued Executive Order 1885, January 27, 1914, effective April 1, 1914, abolishing the previous governance and placing it under the direction of the Secretary of War, with the entity designated as The Panama Canal. This Executive Order charged the Governor of the Panama Canal with &quot;completion, maintenance, operation, government and sanitation of the Panama Canal and its adjuncts and the government of the Canal Zone&quot;. A number of departments were specified in the order, with others to be established as needed by the Governor of the Panama Canal with approval of the President and under the supervision of the Secretary of War. Defense of the canal was the responsibility of the Secretary of War who retained control of troops with provisions for presidential appointment of an Army officer in wartime who would have &quot;exclusive authority over the operation of the Panama Canal and the Government of the Canal Zone&quot;. The executive order noted in closing &quot;that the supervision of the operations of the Panama Canal under the permanent organization should be under the Secretary of War&quot;, thus establishing the essentially military arrangement and atmosphere for the canal and Canal Zone.

On September 5, 1939, with the outbreak of war in Europe Executive Order 8232 placed governance of the Canal and &quot;all its adjuncts and appurtenances, including the government of the Canal Zone&quot; under the exclusive control of the Commanding General, Panama Canal Department for the duration. The US Secretary of War stated that the air forces and anti-aircraft artillery covering the Canal Zone must be greatly augmented. Prior to 1939, the equipment of the Air Corps was generally outdated and of questionable value. Thereafter, air defense of the Zone underwent major expansions.

Effective July 1, 1951, under an act of Congress dated September 26, 1950 (64 Stat. 1038), governance of the Canal Zone was through the Canal Zone Government with the canal operated by the Panama Canal Company until 1979 when the Panama Canal Commission took over its governance. The entire structure was under the control of the United States government with the secretary of the Army appointing the Panama Canal Company board of directors and the Canal Zone Government was entirely financed by the company. The office of the governor of the Panama Canal Zone was not usually a stepping stone to higher political office but a position given to US Army active duty general officers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The governor was also president of the Panama Canal Company. The Canal Zone had its own police force (the Canal Zone Police), courts, and judges (the United States District Court for the Canal Zone).

Everyone worked for the company or the government in one form or another. Residents did not own their homes; instead, they rented houses assigned primarily based on seniority in the zone. When an employee moved away, the house would be listed and employees could apply for it. The utility companies were also managed by the company. There were no independent stores; goods were brought in and sold at stores run by the company, such as a commissary, housewares, and so forth.

In 1952, the Panama Canal Company was required to go on a break-even basis in an announcement made in the form of the president&#x27;s budget submission to the United States Congress. Though company officials had been involved in previewing the requirement, there was no disclosure in advance, even though the Bureau of the Budget directed that the new régime become effective on March 1. The company organization was realigned into three main divisions; Canal Activity and Commercial Activity with the Service Activity providing services to both operating activities at rates sufficient to recover costs. Rate adjustments in housing and other employee services would be required and a form of valuation, compared to a property tax, would be used to determine each division&#x27;s contribution to the Canal Zone Government.

== Territory ==
The Panama Canal Zone was located within the territory of Panama, consisting of the Panama Canal and an area generally extending on each side of the centerline, but excluding Panama City and Colón, which would have otherwise fallen in part within the limits of the Canal Zone. When artificial lakes were created to assure a steady supply of water for the locks, those lakes were included within the zone. Its border spanned two of the provinces of Panama: Colón and Panamá. The total area of the territory was 553 square miles (1,430 km2).

Although it was under the control of the United States, the zone did not have formal boundary restrictions on Panamanians transiting to either half of their country, or for any other visitors. A Panama Canal fence did exist along the main highway, although it was only a safety measure to separate pedestrians from traffic, and some of the Canal Zone territory was beyond it. In Panama City, if there were no protests interfering with movement, one could enter the Zone simply by crossing a street.

==Tensions and the end of the Canal Zone==
In 1903, the United States, having failed to obtain from Colombia the right to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, which was part of that country, sent warships in support of Panamanian independence from Colombia. This being achieved, the new nation of Panama ceded to the Americans the rights they wanted in the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty. Over time, though, the existence of the Canal Zone, a political exclave of the United States that cut Panama geographically in half and had its own courts, police, and civil government, became a cause of conflict between the two countries. Major rioting and clashes occurred on May 21, 1958, and on November 3, 1959. Demonstrations occurred at the opening of the Thatcher Ferry Bridge, now known as the Bridge of the Americas, in 1962 and serious rioting occurred in January 1964. This led to the United States easing its controls in the Zone. For example, Panamanian flags were allowed to be flown alongside American ones. After extensive negotiations, the Canal Zone ceased to exist on October 1, 1979, in compliance with provisions of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties.
In 1989, the United States invaded Panama with virtually all of the military operations taking place within the Canal Zone including Operation Acid Gambit, the Raid at Renacer Prison among many others including operations at the entrance, exit and all of the locks.

==Lifestyle of residents==

===&quot;Gold&quot; roll and &quot;silver&quot; roll===
During its construction and into the 1940s, the labor force in the Canal Zone (which was almost entirely publicly employed) was divided into a &quot;gold&quot; roll (short for payroll) classification, and a &quot;silver&quot; roll classification. The origins of this system are unclear, but it was the practice on the 19th-century Panama Railroad to pay Americans in US gold and local workers in silver coin. Although some Canal Zone officials compared the gold roll to military officers and the silver roll to enlisted men, the characteristic that determined on which roll an employee was placed was race. With very few exceptions, American and Northern European (White) workers were placed on the gold roll, and Black and southern European workers on the silver roll. Black Americans were generally not hired; Black employees were from the Caribbean, often from Barbados and Jamaica. White Americans seeking work as laborers, which were almost entirely silver roll positions, were discouraged from applying. In the early days of the system, bosses could promote exceptional workers from silver to gold, but this practice soon ceased as race came to be the determining factor. As a result of the initial policy, there were several hundred skilled black and Southern European workers on the gold roll. In November 1906, Chief Engineer John Stevens ordered that most black people on the gold roll be placed on the silver roll instead (a few remained in such roles as teachers and postmasters); the following month, the Canal Commission reported that the 3,700 gold roll employees were &quot;almost all White Americans&quot; and the 13,000 silver roll workers were &quot;mostly aliens&quot;. On February 8, 1908, President Roosevelt ordered that no further non-Americans be placed on the gold roll. After Panamanians objected, the gold roll was reopened to them in December 1908; however, efforts to remove non-American workers from the gold roll continued.

Until 1918, when all employees began to be paid in U.S. dollars, gold roll employees were paid in gold, in American currency, while their silver roll counterparts were paid in silver coin, initially Colombian pesos. Through the years of canal construction, silver roll workers were paid with coins from various nations; in several years, coin was imported from the United States because of local shortages. Even after 1918, both the designations and the disparity in privileges lingered.

===&quot;Diasporization&quot; in the Panama Canal Zone===
Until the end of World War II in 1945, the Panama Canal Zone operated under a Jim Crow society, where the category of &quot;gold&quot; represented White, U.S. workers and the title &quot;silver&quot; represented the non-White, non-U.S. workers on the Zone. There were even separate entrances for each group at the Post Office. After the strike of 1920, the black workers were banned from unionizing by the U.S. Canal officials. As a result, the Panama Canal West Indian Employees Association (PCWIEA) was created in 1924 to fill this vacuum of representation. The PCWIEA did not garner much support on the Canal Zone because of its restrictive membership policies and the haunting of the 1920 strike and its damaging consequences. However, in 1946, the PCWIEA summoned the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for representation and the establishment of a local union. In July of that year, the West Indian and Panamanian workers received a charter for Local 713 of the United Public Workers of America (UPWA)-CIO. Together, with the assistance of U.S. representatives for the Local, these black workers came together to secure material benefits for their livelihoods. They organized together in order to pose a serious threat to the Jim Crow system which resulted, however, only in minimal gains. American segregationist policies persisted as it related to housing and schooling. In the end, ties to communism destroyed the UPWA and as a result Local 713 collapsed. Nevertheless, Frank Gurridy describes this as diasporization, &quot;diaspora in action, or the ways Afro-diasporic linkages were made in practice&quot;. In the case of the Panama Canal Zone, these linkages were made not only by the West Indian and Panamanian communities, but also between the Afro descended workers on the Zone and African Americans, on the mainland of the U.S., through the transnational struggle to dismantle the system of Jim Crow.

===Community===

====Housing and goods====
Canal Zone housing was constructed in the early days of construction, as part of Stevens&#x27; plans. Housing constructed for couples and families consisted of structures containing four two-story apartments. The units had corrugated-iron roofs, and were uniformly painted gray with white trim. Constructed of pine clapboard, they had long windows and high ceilings, allowing for air movement. Better-paid employees were entitled to more square feet of housing, the unit in which allowances were expressed. Initially, employees received one square foot per dollar of monthly salary. Stevens from the first encouraged gold roll employees to send for their wives and children; to encourage them to do so, wives were granted a housing allowance equal to their husband&#x27;s, even if they were not employees. Bachelors mostly resided in hotel-like structures. The structures all had screened verandas and up-to-date plumbing. The government furnished power, water, coal for cooking, ice for iceboxes, lawn care, groundskeeping, garbage disposal, and, for bachelors only, maid service.

In the first days of the Canal Zone, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC) provided no food, and workers had to fend for themselves, obtaining poor-quality food at inflated prices from Panamanian merchants. When Stevens arrived in 1905, he ordered food to be provided at cost, leading to the establishment of the Canal Zone Commissary. The functions of the Commissary quickly grew, generally against the will of the Panamanian government, which saw more and more goods and services provided in the Zone rather than in Panama. Merchants could not compete with the commissary&#x27;s prices or quality; for example, it boasted that the meat it sold had been refrigerated every moment from the Chicago slaughterhouse to the moment it was passed to the consumer. By 1913, it consisted of 22 general stores, 7 cigar stores, 22 hostels, 2 hotels, and a mail-order division. It served high-quality meals at small expense to workers and more expensive meals to upper-echelon canal employees and others able to afford it.

The commissary was a source of friction between the Canal Zone and Panama for several other reasons. It dominated sales of supplies to passing ships. The commissary was off limits to individuals who were not in the U.S. Military, employees of the Panama Canal Company, the Canal Zone Government and/or their dependents. This restriction was requested by Panama for the benefit of Panamanian storekeepers, who feared the loss of trade. Panama had laws restricting imports from the Canal Zone. Goods from the commissary would sometimes show up in Panamanian stores and in vendor displays, where goods were deemed of high quality. Additionally, there were separate commissaries on the U.S. military installations that were available only to the U.S. military personnel and their dependents. Employees and dependents of the Panama Canal Company/Government were not allowed to use the commissaries, exchanges, package stores, theaters, gas stations, and other facilities on the U.S. military installations.

==Citizenship==

The treaty with Panama made no mention of the nationality status of the native inhabitants of the Zone. Pursuant to the principles of international law, they became non-citizen U.S. nationals unless they elected to retain their previous nationality. Children of non-citizen U.S. nationals generally acquired the status of their parents. 

For most nationality purposes under U.S. federal law, the Canal Zone was considered to be foreign territory and the status persons acquired at birth was governed by Sec. 1993 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Act of February 10, 1855, 10 Stat. 604), which granted them statutory U.S. citizenship at birth but only if their fathers were, at the time of the child&#x27;s birth, U.S. citizens who had previously resided in the United States. In 1934, the law was amended to allow for citizenship to be acquired at birth through either parent if the parent was a U.S. citizen who had previously resided in the United States. In 1937, a new law (Act of August 4, 1937, 50 Stat. 558) was enacted to provide for U.S. citizenship to persons born in the Canal Zone (since 1904) to a U.S. citizen parent without that parent needing to have been previously resident in the United States. The law is now codified under title 8, section 1403. It not only grants statutory and declaratory born citizenship to those born in the Canal Zone after February 26, 1904, of at least one U.S. citizen parent, but also does so retroactively for all children born of at least one U.S. citizen in the Canal Zone before the law&#x27;s enactment. 

When John McCain, born in the Zone in 1936 to U.S. parents, became the 2008 Republican Party presidential nominee, there was minor debate over whether he met the presidency&#x27;s &quot;natural-born Citizen&quot; requirement. The U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution that he did.

==Panama Canal Treaty implementation==
On October 1, 1979, the day the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 took effect, most of the land within the former Canal Zone was transferred to Panama. However, the treaty set aside many Canal Zone areas and facilities for transfer during the following 20 years. The treaty specifically categorized areas and facilities by name as &quot;Military Areas of Coordination&quot;, &quot;Defense Sites&quot; and &quot;Areas Subject to Separate Bilateral Agreement&quot;. These were to be transferred by the U.S. to Panama during certain time windows or simply by the end of the 243-month treaty period. On October 1, 1979, among the many such parcels so designated in the treaty, 35 emerged as enclaves (surrounded entirely by land solely under Panamanian jurisdiction). In later years, as other areas were turned over to Panama, nine more enclaves emerged.

At least 13 other parcels each were enclosed partly by land under the absolute jurisdiction of Panama and partly by an &quot;Area of Civil Coordination&quot; (housing), which under the treaty was subject to elements of both U.S. and Panamanian public law. In addition, the 1977 treaty designated numerous areas and individual facilities as &quot;Canal Operating Areas&quot; for joint U.S.–Panama ongoing operations by a commission. On the effective date of the treaty, many of these, including Madden Dam, became newly surrounded by the territory of Panama. Just after noon local time on December 31, 1999, all former Canal Zone parcels of all types had come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Panama.

The 44 enclaves of U.S. territory that existed under the treaty are shown in the table below.
: * Enclaves are a subset of those areas that were categorized in the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty as &quot;Military Area of Coordination&quot;, &quot;Defense Site&quot; and &quot;Area Subject to Separate Bilateral Agreement&quot;. The map legends and color coding that are contained in the Panama Canal Treaty Annex provide visual corroborations of the treaty language.

==Postage stamps==
The Panama Canal Zone issued its own postage stamps from 1904 until October 25, 1978. During the early years, United States postage stamps overprinted &quot;Canal Zone&quot; were used. After a few years, accredited Canal Zone stamps were issued.

After a transition period during which Panama took over the administration of postal service, Canal Zone stamps became invalid.

The two-letter state abbreviation for mail sent to the Zone was CZ.

==Amateur radio==
Amateur radio licenses were issued by the United States Federal Communications Commission and carried the prefix KZ5, the initial &#x27;K&#x27; indicating a station under American jurisdiction. The American Radio Relay League had a Canal Zone section, and the Canal Zone was considered an &quot;entity&quot; for purposes of the DX Century Club. Contacts with Canal Zone stations from before repatriation may still be counted for DXCC credit separate from Panama. The KZ5 amateur radio prefix has been issued to license operators since 1979 but today has no special meaning.

<text>Actinophrys is a genus of heliozoa, amoeboid unicellular organisms with many axopodial filaments that radiate out of their cell. It contains one of the most common heliozoan species, &quot;Actinophrys sol&quot;. It is classified within the monotypic family Actinophryidae.

== Characteristics ==

&quot;Actinophrys&quot; species belong to an informal group known as heliozoa, which are unicellular eukaryotes (or protists) that are heterotrophic (also known as protozoa) and present stiff radiating arms known as axopodia. In particular, &quot;Actinophrys&quot; species are characterized by axonemes consisting of double interlocking spirals of microtubules. Their axonemes end on a large central nucleus. They are also characterized by the siliceous material present in their cysts.

== Systematics ==

&quot;Actinophrys&quot; was described in 1830 by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, with the type species &quot;Actinophrys sol&quot;. The species originally belonged to a genus named &quot;Trichoda&quot;, described earlier by Otto Friedrich Müller and later declared obsolete. In 1824, Bory de St. Vincent transferred that species to a new genus &quot;Peritricha&quot; but, without any new observations to justify the change, it fell out of use.

=== Species ===

There are currently four accepted species of &quot;Actinophrys&quot;.

* &quot;Actinophrys sol&quot; (=&quot;A. difformis&quot; ; &quot;A. marina&quot; ; &quot;A. stella&quot; ; &quot;A. oculata&quot; ; &quot;A. tenuipes&quot; ; &quot;A. fissipes&quot; ; &quot;A. longipes&quot; ; &quot;A. tunicata&quot; ; &quot;A. limbata&quot; ; &quot;A. paradoxa&quot; ; &quot;A. picta&quot; ; &quot;A. alveolata&quot; ; &quot;A. subalpina&quot; ; &quot;A. vesiculata&quot; )
* &quot;Actinophrys pontica&quot; 
* &quot;Actinophrys salsuginosa&quot; 
* &quot;Actinophrys tauryanini&quot;

<text>Secure Digital, officially abbreviated as SD, is a proprietary, non-volatile, flash memory card format the SD Association (SDA) developed for use in portable devices.

Because of their small physical dimensions, SD cards became widely used in many consumer electronic devices, such as digital cameras, camcorders, video game consoles, mobile phones, action cameras such as the GoPro Hero series, and camera drones.

The standard was introduced in August 1999 by SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita) and Toshiba as an improvement on MultiMediaCards (MMCs). SDs have become an industry standard. The three companies formed SD-3C, LLC, a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property (IP) rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host-and-ancillary products.

In January 2000, the companies formed the SD Association (SDA), a non-profit organization to create and promote SD card standards. , the SDA has approximately 1,000 member companies. It uses several SD-3C-owned trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and denote compatibility.

== History ==

=== 1999–2005: Creation and introduction of smaller formats ===
In 1999, SanDisk, Panasonic (Matsushita) and Toshiba agreed to develop and market the Secure Digital (SD) memory card. The card was derived from the MultiMediaCard (MMC) and provided digital rights management (DRM) based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) standard and a high memory density (&quot;data/bits per physical space&quot;), i.e. a large quantity of data could be stored in a small physical space.

SD was designed to compete with the Memory Stick, a flash storage format with DRM Sony had released the year before. Toshiba hoped the SD card&#x27;s DRM would encourage music suppliers concerned about piracy to use SD cards.

The trademarked SD logo was originally developed for the Super Density Disc, which was the unsuccessful Toshiba entry in the DVD format war. For this reason, the letter &quot;D&quot; is styled to resemble an optical disc.

At the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the three companies announced the creation of the SD Association (SDA) to promote SD cards. The SD Association, which was headquartered in San Ramon, California, United States, then had 30 member companies and product manufacturers that made interoperable memory cards and devices. Early samples of the SD card became available in the first quarter of 2000, and production quantities of 32 and 64 megabyte (MB) cards became available three months later. The first 64 MB cards were offered for sale for US$200. SD was envisioned as a single memory card format for several kinds of electronic devices, that could also function as an expansion slot for adding new capabilities for a device. The first 256 MB and 512 MB SD cards were announced in 2001.

==== miniSD ====
At March 2003 CeBIT, SanDisk Corporation introduced, announced and demonstrated the miniSD form factor. The SDA adopted the miniSD card in 2003 as a small-form-factor extension to the SD card standard. While the new cards were designed for mobile phones, they were usually packaged with a miniSD adapter that provided compatibility with a standard SD memory card slot.

==== microSD ====

MicroSD form-factor memory cards were introduced in 2004 by SanDisk at CeBIT and originally called T-Flash, and later TransFlash, commonly abbreviated to &quot;TF&quot;. T-Flash was renamed microSD in 2005 when it was adopted by the SDA. TransFlash and microSD cards are functionally identical, allowing either to operate in devices made for the other. A passive adapter allows the use of microSD and TransFlash cards in SD card slots.

=== 2006–2008: SDHC and SDIO ===
In September 2006, SanDisk announced the 4 GB miniSDHC. Like the SD and SDHC, the miniSDHC card has the same form factor as the older miniSD card but the HC card requires HC support built into the host device. Devices that support miniSDHC work with miniSD and miniSDHC, but devices without specific support for miniSDHC work only with the older miniSD card. Since 2008, miniSD cards are no longer produced, due to market domination of the even smaller microSD cards.

=== 2009–2019: SDXC ===
The storage density of memory cards increased significantly throughout the 2010s, allowing the earliest devices to offer support for the SD:XC standard, such as the Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Galaxy Note II mobile phones, to expand their available storage to several hundreds of gigabytes.

In January 2009, the SDA announced the SDXC family, which supports cards up to 2 TB and speeds up to 300 MB/s. SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system by default. SDXC was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2009 (January 7–10). At the same show, SanDisk and Sony also announced a comparable Memory Stick XC variant with the same 2 TB maximum as SDXC, and Panasonic announced plans to produce 64 GB SDXC cards. On March 6, Pretec introduced the first SDXC card, a 32 GB card with a read/write speed of 400 Mbit/s. But only early in 2010 did compatible host devices come onto the market, including Sony&#x27;s Handycam HDR-CX55V camcorder, Canon&#x27;s EOS 550D (also known as Rebel T2i) Digital SLR camera, a USB card reader from Panasonic, and an integrated SDXC card reader from JMicron. The earliest laptops to integrate SDXC card readers relied on a USB 2.0 bus, which does not have the bandwidth to support SDXC at full speed.

In early 2010, commercial SDXC cards appeared from Toshiba (64 GB), Panasonic (64 GB and 48 GB), and SanDisk (64 GB).

In early 2011, Centon Electronics, Inc. (64 GB and 128 GB) and Lexar (128 GB) began shipping SDXC cards rated at Speed Class 10. Pretec offered cards from 8 GB to 128 GB rated at Speed Class 16. In September 2011, SanDisk released a 64 GB microSDXC card. Kingmax released a comparable product in 2011.

In April 2012, Panasonic introduced MicroP2 card format for professional video applications. The cards are essentially full-size SDHC or SDXC UHS-II cards, rated at UHS Speed Class U1. An adapter allows MicroP2 cards to work in current P2 card equipment.

Panasonic MicroP2 cards shipped in March 2013 and were the first UHS-II compliant products on market; initial offer includes a 32 GB SDHC card and a 64 GB SDXC card. Later that year, Lexar released the first 256 GB SDXC card, based on 20 nm NAND flash technology.

In February 2014, SanDisk introduced the first 128 GB microSDXC card, which was followed by a 200 GB microSDXC card in March 2015. September 2014 saw SanDisk announce the first 512 GB SDXC card.

Samsung announced the world&#x27;s first EVO Plus 256 GB microSDXC card in May 2016, and in September 2016 Western Digital (SanDisk) announced that a prototype of the first 1 TB SDXC card would be demonstrated at Photokina.

In August 2017, SanDisk launched a 400 GB microSDXC card.

In January 2018, Integral Memory unveiled its 512 GB microSDXC card. In May 2018, PNY launched a 512 GB microSDXC card. In June 2018 Kingston announced its Canvas series of microSD cards which were capable of capacities up to 512 GB, in three variations, Select, Go! and React.

In February 2019, Micron and SanDisk unveiled their microSDXC cards of 1 TB capacity.

=== 2019–present: SDUC ===
The Secure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) format supports cards up to 128 TB and offers speeds up to 985 MB/s.

In April 2024, Western Digital (SanDisk) revealed the world&#x27;s first 4 TB SD card at NAB 2024, which will make use of the SDUC format. It is set to release in 2025.

== Capacity ==
Secure Digital includes five card families available in three form factors. The five families are the original standard capacity (SDSC), high capacity (SDHC), extended capacity (SDXC), ultra capacity (SDUC) and SDIO, which combines input/output functions with data storage.

=== SD (SDSC) ===


The second-generation Secure Digital (SDSC or Secure Digital Standard Capacity) card was developed to improve on the MultiMediaCard (MMC) standard, which continued to evolve, but in a different direction. Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:

* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevents inserting it upside down (whereas an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).
* Most standard size SD cards are thick, with microSD versions being thick, compared to for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called Thin SD with a thickness of 1.4 mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors.
* The card&#x27;s electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user&#x27;s fingers.
* The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see below.
* While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates.
* The SD card added Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM) security circuitry for digital rights management (DRM) content-protection.
* Addition of a write-protect notch

Full-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other.

===SDHC===
The Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32 GB. The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility.

SDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC). The major compatibility issues between SDHC and SDSC cards are the redefinition of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register in version 2.0 (see below), and the fact that SDHC cards are shipped preformatted with the FAT32 file system.

Version 2.0 also introduces a high-speed bus mode for both SDSC and SDHC cards, which doubles the original Standard Speed clock to produce 25 MB/s.

SDHC host devices are required to accept older SD cards. However, older host devices do not recognize SDHC or SDXC memory cards, although some devices can do so through a firmware upgrade. Older Windows operating systems released before Windows 7 require patches or service packs to support access to SDHC cards.

===SDXC===
The Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (SDXC) format, announced in January 2009 and defined in version 3.01 of the SD specification, supports cards up to 2 TB, compared to a limit of 32 GB for SDHC cards in the SD 2.0 specification. SDXC adopts Microsoft&#x27;s exFAT file system as a mandatory feature.

Version 3.01 also introduced the Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus for both SDHC and SDXC cards, with interface speeds from 50 MB/s to 104 MB/s for four-bit UHS-I bus. (this number has since been exceeded with SanDisk proprietary technology for 170 MB/s read, which is not proprietary anymore, as Lexar has the 1066x running at 160 MB/s read and 120 MB/s write via UHS 1, and Kingston also has their Canvas Go! Plus, also running at 170 MB/s).

Version 4.0, introduced in June 2011, allows speeds of 156 MB/s to 312 MB/s over the four-lane (two differential lanes) UHS-II bus, which requires an additional row of physical pins.

Version 5.0 was announced in February 2016 at CP+ 2016, and added &quot;Video Speed Class&quot; ratings for UHS cards to handle higher resolution video formats like 8K. The new ratings define a minimal write speed of 90 MB/s.

SDXC cards are required to be formatted using exFAT, but many operating systems will support others.

Windows Vista (SP1) and later and OS X (10.6.5 and later) have native support for exFAT. (Windows XP and Server 2003 can support exFAT via an optional update from Microsoft.)

Most BSD and Linux distributions did not have exFAT support for legal reasons, though in Linux kernel 5.4 Microsoft open-sourced the spec and allowed the inclusion of an exFAT driver. Users of older kernels or BSD can manually install third-party implementations of exFAT (as a FUSE module) in order to be able to mount exFAT-formatted volumes. However, SDXC cards can be reformatted to use any file system (such as ext4, UFS, VFAT or NTFS), alleviating the restrictions associated with exFAT availability.

The SD Association provides a formatting utility for Windows and Mac OS X that checks and formats SD, SDHC, SDXC and SDUC cards.

Except for the change of file system, SDXC cards are mostly backward compatible with SDHC readers, and many SDHC host devices can use SDXC cards if they are first reformatted to the FAT32 file system.

===SDUC===
The Secure Digital Ultra Capacity (SDUC) format, described in the SD 7.0 specification, and announced in June 2018, supports cards up to 128 TB, regardless of form factor, either micro or full size, or interface type including UHS-I, UHS-II, UHS-III or SD Express.

== Speed ==
SD card speed is customarily rated by its sequential read or write speed. The sequential performance aspect is the most relevant for storing and retrieving large files (relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory), such as images and multimedia. Small data (such as file names, sizes and timestamps) falls under the much lower speed limit of random access, which can be the limiting factor in some use cases.

With early SD cards, a few card manufacturers specified the speed as a &quot;times&quot; (&quot;×&quot;) rating, which compared the average speed of reading data to that of the original CD-ROM drive. This was superseded by the Speed Class Rating, which guarantees a minimum rate at which data can be written to the card.

The newer families of SD card improve card speed by increasing the bus rate (the frequency of the clock signal that strobes information into and out of the card). Whatever the bus rate, the card can signal to the host that it is &quot;busy&quot; until a read or a write operation is complete. Compliance with a higher speed rating is a guarantee that the card limits its use of the &quot;busy&quot; indication.

===Bus===


====Default Speed====
SD cards will read and write at speeds of 12.5 MB/s.

====High Speed====
High-Speed Mode (25 MB/s) was introduced to support digital cameras with 1.10 spec version.

====UHS (Ultra High Speed)====
The Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus is available on some SDHC and SDXC cards.

Cards that comply with UHS show Roman numerals &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;II&#x27; or &#x27;III&#x27; next to the SD card logo, and report this capability to the host device. Use of UHS-I requires that the host device command the card to drop from 3.3-volt to 1.8-volt operation over the I/O interface pins and select the four-bit transfer mode, while UHS-II requires 0.4-volt operation.

The higher speed rates of UHS-II and III are achieved by using two-lane 0.4 V low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) on a second row of pins. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156 MB/s. In full-duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half-duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI).

The following ultra-high speeds are specified:

=====UHS-I=====
Specified in SD version 3.01. Supports a clock frequency of 100 MHz (a quadrupling of the original &quot;Default Speed&quot;), which in four-bit transfer mode could transfer 50 MB/s (SDR50). UHS-I cards declared as UHS104 (SDR104) also support a clock frequency of 208 MHz, which could transfer 104 MB/s. Double data rate operation at 50 MHz (DDR50) is also specified in Version 3.01, and is mandatory for microSDHC and microSDXC cards labeled as UHS-I. In this mode, four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls, transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle, hence a 50 MB/s operation could be transferred using a 50 MHz clock.

There is a proprietary UHS-I extension, called DDR200, originally created by SanDisk that increases transfer speed further to 170 MB/s. Unlike UHS-II, it does not use additional pins. It achieves this by using the 208 MHz frequency of the standard SDR104 mode, but using DDR transfers. This extension has since then been used by Lexar for their 1066x series (160 MB/s), Kingston Canvas Go Plus (170 MB/s) and the MyMemory PRO SD card (180 MB/s).

=====UHS-II=====
Specified in version 4.0, further raises the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of 156 MB/s (full-duplex) or 312 MB/s (half-duplex) using an additional row of pins for LVDS signalling (a total of 17 pins for full-size and 16 pins for micro-size cards). While first implementations in compact system cameras were seen three years after specification (2014), it took many more years until UHS-II was implemented on a regular basis. At the beginning of 2025, 100 DSLR and mirrorless cameras support UHS-II.

=====UHS-III=====
Version 6.0, released in February 2017, added two new data rates to the standard. FD312 provides 312 MB/s while FD624 doubles that. Both are full-duplex. The physical interface and pin-layout are the same as with UHS-II, retaining backward compatibility.

====SD Express====
The SD Express bus was released in June 2018 with SD specification 7.0. It uses a single PCIe lane to provide full-duplex 985 MB/s transfer speed. Supporting cards must also implement the NVM Express storage access protocol. The Express bus can be implemented by SDHC, SDXC and SDUC cards. For legacy application use, SD Express cards must also support High-Speed bus and UHS-I bus. The Express bus re-uses the pin layout of UHS-II cards and reserves the space for additional two pins that may be introduced in the future.

Hosts which implement version 7.0 of the spec allow SD Cards to do direct memory access, which increases the attack surface of the host dramatically in the face of malicious SD cards.

Version 8.0 was announced on 19 May 2020, with support for two PCIe lanes with an additional row of contacts and PCIe 4.0 transfer rates, for a maximum bandwidth of 3,938 MB/s.

Version 9.0 was released in February 2022.

Version 9.1 was announced in October 2023.

===== microSD Express=====
In February 2019, the SD Association announced microSD Express. The microSD Express cards offer PCI Express and NVMe interfaces, as the June 2018 SD Express release did, alongside the legacy microSD interface for continued backwards compatibility. The SDA also released visual marks to denote microSD Express memory cards to make matching the card and device easier for optimal device performance.

===Class===
The SD Association defines standard speed classes for SDHC/SDXC cards indicating minimum performance (minimum serial data writing speed). Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:

The SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class and Video Speed Class.

====Speed Class====
Speed Class ratings 2, 4 and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state.

Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10 MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode. The host device can read a card&#x27;s speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application&#x27;s minimum need. By comparison, the older &quot;×&quot; rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed.

The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with &#x27;C&#x27; (C2, C4, C6 and C10).

=====&quot;×&quot; rating=====


The &quot;×&quot; rating, which was used by some card manufacturers and made obsolete by speed classes, is a multiple of the standard CD-ROM drive speed of 150 KB/s (approximately 1.23 Mbit/s). Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6×) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900 kbit/s or 7.37 Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification defines speeds up to 200×, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card&#x27;s fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including Transcend and Kingston, report their cards&#x27; write speed. When a card lists both a speed class and an &quot;×&quot; rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.

====UHS Speed Class====
UHS-I and UHS-II cards can use UHS Speed Class rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum write performance of at least 10 MB/s (&#x27;U1&#x27; symbol featuring number 1 inside &#x27;U&#x27;) and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30 MB/s (&#x27;U3&#x27; symbol featuring 3 inside &#x27;U&#x27;), targeted at recording 4K video. Before November 2013, the rating was branded &quot;UHS Speed Grade&quot; and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 (&#x27;U1&#x27; symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6 and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.

UHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with tapeless camcorders while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.

====Video Speed Class====
Video Speed Class defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern MLC NAND flash memory and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6 – 90 MB/s. The graphical symbols use a stylized &#x27;V&#x27; followed by a number designating write speed (&quot;i.e.&quot; V6, V10, V30, V60 and V90).

====SD Express Speed Class====
Version 9.1 of the SD specification, introduced in October 2023, defines new SD Express speed classes. The graphical symbols use a stylized &#x27;E&#x27; followed by a number designating the minimum read/write speed. The specified classes are E150, E300, E450 and E600.

===Application Performance Class===
Application Performance Class is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Writing Speeds but also mandates a minimum IOPS for reading and writing. Class A1 requires a minimum of 1,500 reading and 500 writing operations per second using 4 kbytes blocks, while class A2 requires 4,000 and 2,000 IOPS. A2 class cards require host driver support as they use command queuing and write caching to achieve their higher speeds. Without they are guaranteed to at least reach A1 speeds. As of Linux kernel 5.15, it fully supports A2.

===Real-world performance===
In applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card&#x27;s class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition camcorder may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. Digital cameras with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.

The speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card&#x27;s speed depends on many factors, including:
* The frequency of soft errors that the card&#x27;s controller must re-try
* Write amplification: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve wear leveling.
* File fragmentation: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical hard drives, but may decrease speed⁠—for instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file&#x27;s next fragment is stored.

In addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file (sequential access, as when a digital camera records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a random-access use common in smartphones). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38 MB/s, while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not &quot;necessarily&quot; mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower. In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.

==Features==
===Card security===

====Commands to disable writes====
The host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.

====Write-protect notch====


Most full-size SD cards have a &quot;mechanical write protect switch&quot; allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: &quot;It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position [i.e., setting] of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.&quot; Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.

The switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.

When looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.

On the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.

Cards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.

====Card password====

A host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16 bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.

Windows Phone 7 devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked &quot;to the phone with an automatically generated key&quot; so that &quot;the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC&quot;. Symbian devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards. It is therefore possible to use a device such as the Nokia N8 to reformat the card for subsequent use in other devices.

===smartSD cards===
A smartSD memory card is a microSD card with an internal &quot;secure element&quot; that allows the transfer of ISO 7816 Application Protocol Data Unit commands to, for example, JavaCard applets running on the internal secure element through the SD bus.

Some of the earliest versions of microSD memory cards with secure elements were developed in 2009 by DeviceFidelity, Inc., a pioneer in near-field communication (NFC) and mobile payments, with the introduction of In2Pay and CredenSE products, later commercialized and certified for mobile contactless transactions by Visa in 2010. DeviceFidelity also adapted the In2Pay microSD to work with the Apple iPhone using the iCaisse, and pioneered the first NFC transactions and mobile payments on an Apple device in 2010.

Various implementations of smartSD cards have been done for payment applications and secured authentication. In 2012 Good Technology partnered with DeviceFidelity to use microSD cards with secure elements for mobile identity and access control.

microSD cards with Secure Elements and NFC (near-field communication) support are used for mobile payments, and have been used in direct-to-consumer mobile wallets and mobile banking solutions, some of which were launched by major banks around the world, including Bank of America, US Bank and Wells Fargo, while others were part of innovative new direct-to-consumer neobank programs such as moneto, first launched in 2012.

microSD cards with Secure Elements have also been used for secure voice encryption on mobile devices, which allows for one of the highest levels of security in person-to-person voice communications. Such solutions are heavily used in intelligence and security.

In 2011, HID Global partnered with Arizona State University to launch campus access solutions for students using microSD with Secure Element and MiFare technology provided by DeviceFidelity, Inc. This was the first time regular mobile phones could be used to open doors without need for electronic access keys.

=== Vendor enhancements===


Vendors have sought to differentiate their products in the market through various vendor-specific features:
* Integrated Wi-Fi – Several companies produce SD cards with built-in Wi-Fi transceivers supporting static security (WEP 40/104/128, WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK). The card lets any digital camera with an SD slot transmit captured images over a wireless network, or store the images on the card&#x27;s memory until it is in range of a wireless network. Examples include: Eye-Fi / SanDisk, Transcend Wi-Fi, Toshiba FlashAir, Trek Flucard, PQI Air Card and LZeal ez Share. Some models geotag their pictures.
* Pre-loaded content – In 2006, SanDisk announced Gruvi, a microSD card with extra digital rights management features, which they intended as a medium for publishing content. SanDisk again announced pre-loaded cards in 2008, under the slotMusic name, this time not using any of the DRM capabilities of the SD card. In 2011, SanDisk offered various collections of 1000 songs on a single slotMusic card for about $40, now restricted to compatible devices and without the ability to copy the files.
* Integrated USB connector – The SanDisk SD Plus product can be plugged directly into a USB port without needing a USB card reader. Other companies introduced comparable products, such as the Duo SD product of OCZ Technology and the 3 Way (microSDHC, SDHC and USB) product of A-DATA, which was available in 2008 only.
* Different colors – SanDisk has used various colors of plastic or adhesive label, including a &quot;gaming&quot; line in translucent plastic colors that indicated the card&#x27;s capacity. In 2006, the first 256MB microSD to used color-coded cards by Kingmax, which later other brands (e.g., SanDisk, Kioxia) had been implemented to this day.
* Integrated display – In 2006, ADATA announced a Super Info SD card with a digital display that provided a two-character label and showed the amount of unused memory on the card.

===SDIO cards===


A SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) card is an extension of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, barcode readers, FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet and IrDA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.

SDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.

The SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card&#x27;s I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized USB device classes and Bluetooth profiles.)

The SDIO family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a &quot;combo card&quot; (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400 kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as &quot;interrupt&quot; to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.

===Compatibility===
Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards. For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.

Older host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card, there are several factors that arise:
* A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).
* A newer card may use a file system the host device cannot navigate (FAT32 for SDHC, exFAT for SDXC)
* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.
* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of storage capacity bits) and SDHC family (ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)
* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.
* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.

==Markets==

Due to their compact size, Secure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size. Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as digital cameras, camcorders and video game consoles, tend to use full-sized cards. Devices in which small size is paramount, such as mobile phones, action cameras such as the GoPro Hero series, and camera drones, tend to use microSD cards.

=== Mobile phones ===
The microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.

While cloud storage depends on stable internet connection and sufficiently voluminous data plans, memory cards in mobile devices provide location-independent and private storage expansion with much higher transfer rates and no network delay, enabling applications such as photography and video recording. While data stored internally on bricked devices is inaccessible, data stored on the memory card can be salvaged and accessed externally by the user as mass storage device. A benefit over USB on the go storage expansion is uncompromised ergonomy. The usage of a memory card also protects the mobile phone&#x27;s non-replaceable internal storage from weardown from heavy applications such as excessive camera usage and portable FTP server hosting over WiFi Direct. Due to the technical development of memory cards, users of existing mobile devices are able to expand their storage further and priceworthier with time.

Recent versions of major operating systems such as Windows Mobile and Android allow applications to run from microSD cards, creating possibilities for new usage models for SD cards in mobile computing markets, as well as clearing available internal storage space.

SD cards are not the most economical solution in devices that need only a small amount of non-volatile memory, such as station presets in small radios. They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as CompactFlash. These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the new SD 7.0 specifications which allow storage capabilities of up to 128 TB.

Many personal computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adapter. Adapters exist for the PC card, ExpressBus, USB, FireWire and the parallel printer port. Active adapters also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as CompactFlash. The FlashPath adapter lets SD cards be used in a floppy disk drive.

Some devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Fit (2011) and Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (2013) have an SD card compartment located externally and accessible by hand, while it is located under the battery cover on other devices. More recent mobile phones use a pin-hole ejection system for the tray which houses both the memory card and SIM card.

===Counterfeits===

Commonly found on the market are mislabeled or counterfeit Secure Digital cards that report a fake capacity or run slower than labeled. Software tools exist to check and detect counterfeit products, and in some cases it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit.

Detection of counterfeit cards usually involves copying files with random data to the SD card until the card&#x27;s capacity is reached, and copying them back. The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. MD5), or trying to compress them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating 0xFFs).

===Digital cameras===
Secure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders with an adapter.

===Personal computers===
Although many personal computers accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary hard disk through the onboard ATA controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling. Primary hard disk use requires a separate SD host controller or an SD-to-CompactFlash converter. However, on computers that support bootstrapping from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the boot disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.

In laptop and tablet computers, memory cards in an integrated memory card reader offer an ergonomical benefit over USB flash drives, as the latter sticks out of the device, and the user would need to be cautious not to bump it while transporting the device, which could damage the USB port. Memory cards have a unified shape and do not reserve a USB port when inserted into a computer&#x27;s dedicated card slot.

Since late 2009, newer Apple computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in macOS from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to Mac OS Extended file format and the default partition table set to GUID Partition Table.

SD cards are increasing in usage and popularity among owners of vintage computers like Atari 8-bit computers. For example SIO2SD (SIO is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. Software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4–8 GB of disk size (2019).

===Embedded systems===
In 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, &quot;leverag[ing] well-known SD standards&quot; to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards. However this standard was not adopted by the market while the MMC standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems. SanDisk provides such embedded memory components under the iNAND brand.

While some modern microcontrollers integrate SDIO hardware which uses the faster proprietary four-bit SD bus mode, almost all modern microcontrollers at least have SPI units that can interface to an SD card operating in the slower one-bit SPI bus mode. If not, SPI can also be emulated by bit banging (e.g. a SD card slot soldered to a Linksys WRT54G-TM router and wired to GPIO pins using DD-WRT&#x27;s Linux kernel achieved only throughput).

===Music distribution===
Prerecorded microSDs have been used to commercialize music under the brands slotMusic and slotRadio by SanDisk and MQS by Astell &amp; Kern.

==Technical details==

===Physical size===

The SD card specification defines three physical sizes. The SD and SDHC families are available in all three sizes, but the SDXC and SDUC families are not available in the mini size, and the SDIO family is not available in the micro size. Smaller cards are usable in larger slots through use of a passive adapter.

====Standard====

* SD (SDSC), SDHC, SDXC, SDIO, SDUC
* (as thin as MMC) for Thin SD (rare)

====MiniSD====
* miniSD, miniSDHC, miniSDIO

==== microSD====
The micro form factor is the smallest SD card format.
* microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC, microSDUC

===Transfer modes===
Cards may support various combinations of the following bus types and transfer modes. The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.
* SPI bus mode: Serial Peripheral Interface Bus is primarily used by embedded microcontrollers. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.
* One-bit SD bus mode: Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.
* Four-bit SD bus mode: Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.
* Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode: Uses two low-voltage differential signaling interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.

The physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two VSS (Ground) pins.



Notes:
# Direction is relative to card. I = Input, O = Output.
# PP = Push-Pull logic, OD = Open-Drain logic.
# S = Power Supply, NC = Not Connected (or logical high).

===Interface===


====Command interface====
SD cards and host devices initially communicate through a synchronous one-bit interface, where the host device provides a clock signal that strobes single bits in and out of the SD card. The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.

Through issuing various commands, the host device can:
* Determine the type, memory capacity and capabilities of the SD card
* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface
* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.

The command interface is an extension of the MultiMediaCard (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.

====Electrical interface====
All SD card families initially use a 3.3 volt electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8 V operation.

At power-up or card insertion, the voltage on pin 1 selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the SD bus. The SD bus starts in one-bit mode, but the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit mode, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.

After determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a higher transfer speed. Until determining the card&#x27;s capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400 kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a &quot;Default Speed&quot; clock rate of 25 MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power. Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.

====MBR and FAT====

Most SD cards ship preformatted with one or more MBR partitions, where the first or only partition contains a file system. This lets them operate like the hard disk of a personal computer. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:

* For SDSC cards:
** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors (smaller than 16 MB): FAT12 with partition type 01h and BPB 3.0 or EBPB 4.1
** Capacity of 32,680 to 65,535 logical sectors (between 16 MB and 32 MB): FAT16 with partition type 04h and BPB 3.0 or EBPB 4.1
** Capacity of at least 65,536 logical sectors (larger than 32 MB): FAT16B with partition type 06h and EBPB 4.1
* For SDHC cards:
** Capacity of less than 16,450,560 logical sectors (smaller than 7.8 GB): FAT32 with partition type 0Bh and EBPB 7.1
** Capacity of at least 16,450,560 logical sectors (larger than 7.8 GB): FAT32 with partition type 0Ch and EBPB 7.1
* For SDXC cards: exFAT with partition type 07h

Most consumer products that take an SD card expect that it is partitioned and formatted in this way. Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.

On such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X&#x27;s &quot;&quot; or Windows&#x27; SCANDISK can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. Defragmentation tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file, but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card&#x27;s rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.

When reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32 MB (65,536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2 GB, FAT16B with partition type 06h and EBPB 4.1 is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4 GB cards, but it requires the use of 64 KB clusters, which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4 GB at all.

The SDXC specification mandates the use of Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary exFAT file system, which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. codice_1/codice_2 on Linux).

====Risks of reformatting====
Reformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use wear leveling, in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient. The SD Association provides freely downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.

SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a &quot;Protected Area&quot; on the card for the SD standard&#x27;s security function. Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it. The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.

===Power consumption===
The power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.

During transfer it may be in the range of 66–330 mW (20–100 mA at a supply voltage of 3.3 V). Specifications from TwinMOS Technologies list a maximum of 149 mW (45 mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264–330 mW (80–100 mA). Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2 mA for one 2006 microSD card. If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably; for reference, the capacity of smartphone batteries is typically around 6 Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2: 1650 mAh @ 3.7 V).

Modern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88 W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II. Minimum power consumption in the case of a UHS-II host is 720 mW.

==Storage capacity and compatibilities==
All SD cards let the host device determine how much information the card can hold, and the specification of each SD family gives the host device a guarantee of the maximum capacity a compliant card reports.

By the time the version 2.0 (SDHC) specification was completed in June 2006, vendors had already devised 2 GB and 4 GB SD cards, either as specified in Version 1.01, or by creatively reading Version 1.00. The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.

===SDSC cards above 1 GB===
SD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 × 512 × 512 B = 1 GB.

Version 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead. Doing so enabled cards with 2 GB and 4 GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4 GB SD card, the Memorette 4 GB SD card and the Hoco 4 GB microSD card.

===Storage capacity calculations===
The format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).

====Version 1====
In version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2 GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:

 Capacity = (C_SIZE + 1) × 2(C_SIZE_MULT + READ_BL_LEN + 2)
 where
 0 ≤ C_SIZE ≤ 4095,
 0 ≤ C_SIZE_MULT ≤ 7,
 READ_BL_LEN is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)

Later versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2 GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1,024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card&#x27;s capacity, but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.

====Versions 2 and 3====
In the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512 KB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved. Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.

* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32 GB.
* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE &gt; 65,375 to indicate a capacity of over 32 GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card&#x27;s maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.

Capacity is calculated thus:

 Capacity = (C_SIZE + 1) × 524288
 where for SDHC
 4112 ≤ C_SIZE ≤ 65375
 ≈2 GB ≤ Capacity ≤ ≈32 GB
 where for SDXC
 65535 ≤ C_SIZE
 ≈32 GB ≤ Capacity ≤ 2 TB

Capacities above 4 GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4 GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.

==Openness of specification==
Like most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous patents and trademarks. Excluding SDIO cards, royalties for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)

Early versions of the SD specification were available under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prohibiting development of open-source drivers. However, the system was eventually reverse-engineered and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.

Under a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 – as opposed to that of SD cards – was later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO and SDIO Bluetooth Type-A.

The Simplified Specification is available.

Again, most of the information had already been discovered and Linux had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the One Laptop per Child project to claim &quot;the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.&quot;

The proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB-based card readers if necessary. These card readers present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.

The SPI-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.

==Data recovery==
A malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged. The controller can in this way be circumvented. This might be harder or even impossible in the case of monolithic card, where the controller resides on the same physical die.

<doc id="315798" wikidata="Q1111831" url="?curid=315798" title="Ermita">
<text>Ermita is a district in central Manila, Philippines. It is a significant center of finance, education, culture, and commerce. Ermita serves as the civic center of Manila, bearing the seat of city government and a large portion of the area&#x27;s employment, business, and entertainment activities.

Private and government offices, museums, and universities thrive in Ermita. It is also home to several tourist attractions and landmarks, including Rizal Park.

Ermita and its neighboring district Malate were originally posh neighborhoods for Manila&#x27;s high society during the early 20th century, where large, grandiose mansions once stood. Ermita and its surroundings were heavily bombed and flattened during the Second World War after it became a battleground during the Manila massacre. After the war, Ermita and its twin district, Malate, had undergone commercialization, shifting from a sprawling upscale suburb to a commercial district.

==History==


===Kingdom of Luzon===
The town of Ermita was originally called &quot;Lagyo&quot; in Tagalog. It was close to Manila.

===Spanish rule (1570–1898)===

During Spanish rule, the town was recorded by Miguel de Loarca in 1582:

Lagyo was re-christened in the 17th century as &quot;La Hermita&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the hermitage&quot;) after the fact that a Mexican hermit resided in the area and on this site was built a hermitage housing an image of the Virgin Mary known as the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Guia&quot; (Our Lady of Guidance). The hermit-priest&#x27;s name was Juan Fernandez de Leon, who was a hermit in Mexico before relocating to Manila. 

The hermitage has since evolved into Ermita Church, rebuilt several times since the early 17th century. During the Spanish evacuation of Ternate in present-day Indonesia, the 200 families of mixed Mexican-Filipino-Spanish and Papuan-Indonesian-Portuguese descent who had ruled over the Christianized Sultanate of Ternate and included their sultan who converted, were relocated to Ternate, Cavite, and Ermita, Manila.

By the 19th century, although still considered as an &quot;arrabal&quot;, which refers to a &quot;rural area&quot;, urban expansion had slowly reached the northern portion of the district mainly due to the development of the &quot;Luneta&quot;, also called &quot;Bagumbayan&quot;, as a promenade at the coast of Manila Bay. The district also saw the construction of the Manila Observatory by Father Federico Faura during the early 1890s. It was once located on a street now named after Fr. Faura himself. Ermita then developed a creole language based on Spanish called Ermiteño, which eventually became extinct after the devastation of the Second World War. However, it still has a surviving cousin language spoken in nearby Cavite.

===American and Commonwealth era (1900–1944)===

Ermita gained renewed prominence during the American and Commonwealth era. As part of Daniel Burnham&#x27;s plans for Manila, influenced by the City Beautiful movement during the early 1900s, Ermita, alongside Intramuros&#x27; surrounding areas, had undergone a drastic redevelopment from being the &quot;outskirts&quot; to urban districts. In 1901, with the chartering of Manila, Ermita would be absorbed by the city of Manila when its area was expanded outside the walled Intramuros.

Burnham envisioned the district, especially in the northern portion, to be the center of the Philippine government, redeveloping Luneta into a grand park patterned after that of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Government buildings housing the legislative, executive and judicial branches were planned to be located in the area. A proposed Philippine capitol was also planned to be built at the eastern tip of Luneta Park but never materialized.

It also became known as the university district, containing the campuses and dormitories of the Philippine Normal University, the University of the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila, the Adamson University, the Assumption College and St. Paul College. The residential portion of Ermita was populated by American residents, who set up such establishments as the Army and Navy Club and the University Club.

Aside from its universities and leisure clubs, Ermita district, as well as its adjacent district, Malate, which both happened to be facing Manila Bay, were once home to Manila&#x27;s high society and were filled with large, gilded mansions. Manila&#x27;s wealthiest families used to live in the twin suburbs.

One notable structure built was the Insular Ice Plant, designed by consulting architect Edgar K. Bourne, who was also the head of the Bureau of Architecture in 1902 (under the Philippine Commission).

===Second World War (1942–1945)===
In February 1945, during the 1945 Battle of Manila, Ermita was the scene of some of the most horrific massacres that occurred during the Second World War. The wife and four children of future President Elpidio Quirino were murdered in Ermita, as was Supreme Court Associate Justice Anacleto Diaz. Between 68% and 85% of Ermita was destroyed during the Battle of Manila, with an estimated total of 100,000 Filipino civilians killed within the city.

===Post-war era (1946–present)===
After the war, the district slowly transformed from a residential area into a commercial area as the upper classes moved to other cities such as Quezon City and Makati.

Ermita was rebuilt after the devastation of the war. University life remained vibrant therein. However, as decades passed, Ermita started earning a reputation as the red-light district of Manila. During the first term of Mayor Alfredo Lim, 1992–1998, efforts were made to &quot;clean up&quot; Ermita&#x27;s image and reputation. However, a local city ordinance prohibiting the establishment of motels, lodging houses, and other similar establishments was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Nightlife in the area dwindled, though it later picked up with the help of the emergence of the nearby Malate district and the Roxas Boulevard revitalization efforts along Manila Bay.

==Accessibility==

The district can be directly accessed by the main roads such as Roxas Boulevard, Padre Burgos Street, Taft Avenue and United Nations Avenue. Lawton Park N Ride, the city&#x27;s main public transport hub, is located in the district along Padre Burgos Street, as well as the Manila Multimodal Terminal near the Pasig River.

The Manila Light Rail Transit System (LRT-1) follows Taft Avenue and stops at three stations in Ermita, namely Central Terminal station, United Nations station and Pedro Gil station.

Pasig River Ferry Service has a ferry station in the district named Lawton.

<text>The United States Steel Corporation is an American steel company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It maintains production facilities at several additional locations in the U.S. and Central Europe.

The company produces and sells steel products, including flat-rolled and tubular products for customers in industries across automotive, construction, consumer, electrical, industrial equipment, distribution, and energy. Operations also include iron ore and coke production facilities.

U.S. Steel ranked eighth among global steel producers in 2008 and 24th by 2022, remaining the second-largest in the U.S. behind Nucor. Renamed USX Corporation in 1986, the company assumed its current name, U.S. Steel, in 2001, after spinning off its energy business, including Marathon Oil, and other assets, from its core steel concern.

Nippon Steel, Japan&#x27;s largest steel producer, announced plans to acquire U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion (or $55 per share), pending approval from regulators and shareholders. The deal, announced in mid-December 2023, retained U.S. Steel&#x27;s name and headquarters in Pittsburgh. The planned acquisition was opposed by the United Steelworkers, the Trump presidential campaign, and the Biden administration. In January 2025, the Biden administration formally blocked the purchase. U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel then filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration for blocking the merger, alleging that the block was unlawful and politically motivated.

==History==
===20th century===

In 1901, J.P. Morgan created U.S. Steel by merging Carnegie Steel, Federal Steel, and National Steel for $492 million, roughly equivalent to $18 billion today. 

During its peak years, U.S. Steel, then known on Wall Street as &quot;The Corporation,&quot; was known more for its size than its efficiency or innovation. In 1901, the company was far and away the largest steel manufacturer, producing roughly two-thirds of the nation&#x27;s steel. The company also operated the largest commercial fleet on the Great Lakes through its Pittsburgh Steamship Company. Due to large debts from its founding, since Andrew Carnegie demanded gold bonds for his share, and concerns about antitrust lawsuits, U.S. Steel operated cautiously. 

In 1902, its first full year of operations, U.S. Steel made 67 percent of all the steel produced in the United States. Roughly a century later, however, in 2001, that production fell to only eight percent.

For much of the 20th century, U.S. Steel was both the world&#x27;s largest steel producer and its largest corporation. It was capitalized at $1.4 billion ($ billion today), making it the world&#x27;s first billion-dollar corporation. 

The company&#x27;s headquarters was located in the Empire State Building in New York City; where it remained one of the building&#x27;s largest tenants for 75 years. Charles M. Schwab, the Carnegie Steel executive who originally suggested the merger to Morgan, ultimately emerged as the new corporation&#x27;s first President.

In 1907, U.S. Steel acquired its largest competitor, the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, and Tennessee Coal was replaced on the Dow Jones Industrial Average by General Electric. The following year, in March 1908, the company formed the Committee on Safety of United States Steel following chairman Elbert H. Gary&#x27;s meetings with safety managers of the operating companies, leading to the introduction of the modern &quot;Safety First&quot; movement. The committee&#x27;s formation was intended to enhance workplace safety, reduce worker accidents, and safeguard the company against criticisms and legal liability.

U.S. Steel&#x27;s primary competitor, Bethlehem Steel, led by former U.S. Steel president Charles M. Schwab, was quicker to innovate. By 1911, U.S. Steel&#x27;s market share had dropped to 50 percent. That same year, James A. Farrell became president and held the position until 1932.

Also in 1911, Standard Oil was broken up by the federal government, and the U.S. government attempted to use federal antitrust laws to break up U.S. Steel, but proved unsuccessful in doing so. 

In a 2008 book, author Douglas Blackmon argued that U.S. Steel’s growth in the South was attributable partly to cheap Black labor and exploited convicts. The company, Blackmon argued, leveraged Black Codes and discriminatory laws to obtain Black workers at lower costs and had agreements with over 20 Alabama counties to use convict labor, paying locals nine dollars a month per worker. Many prisoners were forced into mines under harsh conditions, with some dying from abuse and malnutrition. This convict leasing system persisted into the late 1920s and was widespread across eight Southern states, benefiting companies and farmers alike.

U.S. Steel ranked 16th among United States corporations in the value of its World War II production contracts. Production peaked at more than 35 million tons in 1953. Its employment was greatest in 1943, when it had more than 340,000 employees.

The federal government intervened to try to control U.S. Steel. In 1952, President Harry S. Truman attempted to take over the company&#x27;s steel mills to resolve a crisis with its union, the United Steelworkers of America. The Supreme Court blocked the takeover by ruling that the president did not have the Constitutional authority to seize the mills. President John F. Kennedy was more successful in 1962 when he pressured the steel industry into reversing price increases that Kennedy considered dangerously inflationary.

According to author Dan Carter in &quot;The Politics Of Rage: George Wallace, The Origins Of The New Conservatism, And The Transformation Of American Politics,&quot; U.S. Steel did not support the Kennedy administration’s efforts to involve Alabama businesses in the desegregation of the University of Alabama, which Governor George Wallace had opposed.

In 1963, although the firm employed more than 30,000 workers in Birmingham, Alabama, company president Roger M. Blough &quot;went out of his way to announce that any attempt to use his company position in Birmingham to pressure local whites was &#x27;repugnant to me personally&#x27; and &#x27;repugnant to my fellow officers at U.S. Steel.

In the years following World War II, the steel industry and heavy manufacturing went through a restructuring, leading to a decline in U.S. Steel&#x27;s need for labor, production, and portfolio. Many jobs moved offshore. By 2000, the company employed 52,500 people.
In the early days of the Reagan administration, steel firms won substantial tax breaks in order to compete with imported goods. But instead of modernizing their mills, steel companies shifted capital out of steel and into more profitable areas. In March 1982, U.S. Steel took its concessions and paid $1.4 billion in cash and $4.7 billion in loans for Marathon Oil, saving approximately $500 million in taxes through the merger. The architect of tax concessions to steel firms, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), complained that &quot;we go out on a limb in Congress and we feel they should be putting it in steel.&quot; The events are the subject of &quot;The U.S. Steal Song&quot; by folk singer Anne Feeney.

In 1984, the federal government prevented U.S. Steel from acquiring National Steel, and political pressure from the United States Congress, as well as the United Steelworkers (USW), forced the company to abandon plans to import British Steel Corporation slabs. U.S. Steel finally acquired National Steel&#x27;s assets in 2003, after National Steel went bankrupt. As part of its diversification plan, U.S. Steel acquired Marathon Oil on January 7, 1982, and Texas Oil and Gas several years later. In 1986, it reorganized its holdings as USX Corporation with U.S. Steel renamed USS, Inc. as a major subsidiary.

About 22,000 USX employees stopped work on August 1, 1986, after the United Steelworkers of America and the company could not agree on new employee contract terms. This was characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout. This resulted in most USX facilities becoming idle until February 1, 1987, seriously degrading the steel division&#x27;s market share. A compromise was brokered and accepted by the union membership on January 31, 1987. On February 4, 1987, three days after the agreement had been reached to end the work stoppage, USX announced that four USX plants would remain closed permanently, eliminating about 3,500 union jobs.

In late 1986, Corporate raider Carl Icahn launched a hostile takeover of the steel giant in the midst of the work stoppage. He conducted separate negotiations with the union and with management and proceeded to have proxy battles with shareholders and management. But he abandoned all efforts to buy out the company on January 8, 1987, a few weeks before union employees returned to work. By the late 20th century, U.S. Steel earned most of its revenue from energy operations.

===21st century===

In 2001, under CEO Thomas Usher, it spun off Marathon and other non-steel assets, except Transtar, and expanded internationally by acquiring plants in Slovakia and Serbia.

During the early 2010s, U.S. Steel modernized its software systems across its manufacturing facilities. Facing financial challenges, the company sold its underperforming Serbian mills near Belgrade to the Serbian government in January 2012. In 2014, U.S. Steel’s falling market value caused its removal from the S&amp;P 500 and its transfer to the S&amp;P MidCap 400.

However, in October 2019, U.S. Steel made a bold strategic move by investing $700 million in Big River Steel, securing a 49.9% ownership stake in the pioneering LEED-certified steel facility. Doubling down on its bet, U.S. Steel announced in December 2020 that it would acquire the remaining interest in Big River Steel for $774 million, finalizing the acquisition in January 2021.

In February 2022, U.S. Steel began construction on a new mill in Osceola, Arkansas which will be operational by 2024. In April 2022, the electric arc furnace flat-rolled Big River Steel mill in Osceola became the first ResponsibleSteel site certified in North America following an independent audit by SRI Quality System Registrar (SRI).

====Attempted acquisition by Nippon Steel====

On December 18, 2023, Nippon Steel proposed to acquire U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion, or $55 per share. This was a 142% premium compared to Cleveland-Cliffs, offer of $35 per share. The Nippon proposal was approved by U.S. Steel shareholders in April 2024. Nippon pledged to keep U.S. Steel&#x27;s Pittsburgh headquarters and honor union contracts.

The deal has received a range of reactions from prominent steelworkers labor union United Steelworkers (USW), policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders. On March 14, 2024, U.S. President Joe Biden declared that U.S. Steel must remain American-owned, stating the proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel would pose a risk to national security, and also declared that he would use U.S. regulatory authorities to scuttle the deal. After this revelation, it was noted the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had the authority to block the acquisition based on national security matters.

In July 2024, Nippon Steel hired Mike Pompeo to lobby for its acquisition of U.S. Steel. By September, the Biden Administration signaled plans to block the deal, citing national security concerns. On December 10, 2024, it was reported that then U.S. President Joe Biden intended to block the proposed Nippon acquisition following the completion of a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which later concluded several weeks later. 

On December 18, 2024, a letter from the CFIUS, which was written on December 14, 2024, was obtained by Reuters, which revealed that the stage was set for Biden to block the proposed Nippon Steel deal by the December 23 deadline, concluding that &quot;The Committee has not yet reached consensus on whether the mitigation measures proposed by the Parties would be effective... or whether they would resolve the risk to U.S. national security arising from the Transaction&quot; and that &quot;The President may take such action for such time as the President considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit a covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security.&quot; On December 23, 2024 the CFIUS concluded its review of the proposed Nippon Steel buyout without reaching a consensus on national security risks. The proposed Nippon buyout would then be officially blocked by President Biden on January 3, 2025. On January 6, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel sued the Biden administration over the block.

The companies also filed a RICO complaint against Cleveland-Cliffs, its CEO, and the head of the United Steelworkers, the primary union representing US Steel employees. U.S. Steel said in a statement on January 13, 2025 that it remained committed to closing the deal with Nippon Steel. 

On January 27, 2025, activist investor Ancora Holdings released a proxy fight strategy with the goal of ousting CEO David Burritt and dropping the litigation focused on completing the Nippon deal. U.S, Steel said in a statement that it is still committed to closing the deal.

In February 2025, the president of the United Steelworkers union David McCall came out and publicly supported replacing Burritt with Alan Kestenbaum as CEO. McCall pointed to the collapse of the Nippon acquisition in stating his support for replacing Burritt. Ancora Holdings Group als said it backs the replacement. 

==== Stocks and dividends ====
U.S. Steel is a former Dow Jones Industrial Average component, listed from April 1, 1901, to May 3, 1991. It was removed under its USX Corporation name with Navistar International and Primerica. An original member of the S&amp;P 500 since 1957, U.S. Steel was removed from that index on July 2, 2014, due to declining market capitalization.

The Board of Directors considers the declaration of dividends four times each year, with checks for dividends declared on common stock mailed for receipt on March, June, September, and December. In 2008, the dividend was $0.30 per share, the highest in company history By April 27, 2009, however, it was reduced to $0.05 per share. In February 2020, the dividend was reduced to $0.01 per share but was then later increased back to $0.05 per share in November 2021.

==Legal issues==

===Labor===
U.S. Steel maintained the labor policies of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie believed that &quot;good wages and good workmen I know to be cheap labor.&quot; The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers union that represented workers at the Homestead, Pennsylvania, plant was, for many years, broken after a violent strike in 1892. U.S. Steel defeated another strike in 1901, the year it was founded. U.S. Steel built the city of Gary, Indiana, in 1906, and 100 years later it remained the location of the largest integrated steel mill in the Northern Hemisphere. U.S. Steel reached a détente with unions during World War I, when under pressure from the Wilson Administration it relaxed its opposition to unions enough to allow some to operate in certain factories. It returned to its previous policies as soon as the war ended, however, and in a 1919 strike defeated union-organizing efforts by William Z. Foster of the AFL.

Heavy pressure from public opinion forced the company to give up its 12-hour day and adopt the standard eight-hour day. During the 1920s, U.S. Steel, like many other large employers, coupled paternalistic employment practices with &quot;employee representation plans&quot; (ERPs), which were company unions sponsored by management. These ERPs eventually became an important factor leading to the organization of the United Steelworkers of America. The company dropped its hard-line, anti-union stance in 1937, when Myron Taylor, then president of U.S. Steel, agreed to recognize the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, an arm of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) led by John L. Lewis. Taylor was an outsider, brought in during the Great Depression to rescue U.S. Steel. Watching the upheaval caused by the United Auto Workers&#x27; successful sit-down strike in Flint, Michigan, and convinced that Lewis was someone he could deal with on a businesslike basis, Taylor sought stability through collective bargaining.

Still, U.S. Steel worked hand-in-hand with the Birmingham (Alabama) Police Department as it vigorously investigated and targeted labor activities during the 1930s and 1940s. The corporation developed and fed information to a &quot;Red Squad&quot; of detectives &quot;who used the city&#x27;s vagrancy and criminal-anarchy statutes (liberally reinforced by backroom beatings) to strike at radical labor organizers.&quot; In the 1950s, those investigations shifted from labor to civil rights activists.

The Steelworkers continue to have a contentious relationship with U.S. Steel, but far less so than the relationship that other unions had with employers in other industries in the United States. They launched a number of long strikes against U.S. Steel in 1946 and a 116-day strike in 1959, but those strikes were over wages and benefits and not the more fundamental issue of union recognition that led to violent strikes elsewhere.

The Steelworkers union attempted to mollify the problems of competitive foreign imports by entering into a so-called Experimental Negotiation Agreement (ENA) in 1974. This was to provide for arbitration if the parties were not able to reach an agreement on any new collective bargaining agreements, thereby preventing disruptive strikes. The ENA failed to stop the decline of the steel industry in the U.S.

U.S. Steel and the other employers terminated the ENA in 1984. In 1986, U.S. Steel employees stopped work after a dispute over contract terms, characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout. In a letter to striking employees in 1986, Johnston warned, &quot;There are not enough seats in the steel lifeboat for everybody.&quot; In addition to reducing the role of unions, the steel industry had sought to induce the federal government to take action to counteract the dumping of steel by foreign producers at below-market prices. Neither the concessions nor anti-dumping laws have restored the industry to the health and prestige it once had.

In December 2022, a new four-year contract was ratified between members of the United Steelworkers union and U.S. Steel. This contract covers 11,000 workers at 13 locations. The new agreements were retroactive to September 1, 2022, and included a 5% base wage increase each year for the four years, a $4,000 bonus upon ratification of the deal, $0.50/hour increase in hourly contributions to the Steel Workers Pension Trust, $0.10/hour increase in 401(k) contributions, and uncapped profit-sharing.

===Environmental record===
During the 1948 Donora smog, an air inversion trapped industrial effluent (air pollution) from the American Steel and Wire plant and U.S. Steel&#x27;s Donora Zinc Works in Donora, Pennsylvania.

In three days, 20 people died... After the inversion lifted, another 50 died, including Lukasz Musial, the father of baseball great Stan Musial. Hundreds more lived the rest of their lives with damaged lungs and hearts. But another 40 years would pass before the whole truth about Donora&#x27;s bad air made public-health history.

Today the Donora Smog Museum in that city tells of the influence that the hazardous Donora Smog had on the air quality standards enacted by the federal government in subsequent years.

Researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute have ranked U.S. Steel as the 58th-greatest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States (down from their 2000 ranking as the second-greatest). In 2008, the company released more than one million kg (2.2 million pounds) of toxins, chiefly ammonia, hydrochloric acid, ethylene, zinc compounds, methanol, and benzene, but including manganese, cyanide, and chromium compounds. In 2004, the city of River Rouge, Michigan, and the residents of River Rouge and the nearby city of Ecorse filed a class-action lawsuit against the company for &quot;the release and discharge of air particulate matter...and other toxic and hazardous substances&quot; at its River Rouge plant.

The company has also been implicated in generating water pollution and toxic waste. In 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order for U.S. Steel to clean up a site on the Delaware River in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, where the soil had been contaminated with arsenic, lead, and other heavy metals, as well as naphthalene. Groundwater at the site was found to be polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trichloroethylene (TCE). In 2005, the EPA, United States Department of Justice, and the State of Ohio reached a settlement requiring U.S. Steel to pay more than $100,000 in penalties and $294,000 in reparations in answer to allegations that the company illegally released pollutants into Ohio waters. U.S. Steel&#x27;s Gary, Indiana facility has been repeatedly charged with discharging polluted wastewater into Lake Michigan and the Grand Calumet River. In 1998 the company agreed to payment of a $30 million settlement to clean up contaminated sediments from a five-mile (8 km) stretch of the river.

With the exception of the Fairless Hills and Gary facilities, the lawsuits concern facilities acquired by U.S. Steel via its 2003 purchase of National Steel Corporation, not its historic facilities.

In 2021, U.S. Steel announced a goal to target net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company previously set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 20% by 2030.

==Legacy==

===U.S. Steel Tower===
The U.S. Steel Tower in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is named after the company and since 1970, the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters have been located there. It is the tallest skyscraper in the downtown Pittsburgh skyline, built out of the company&#x27;s Corten Steel. New York City&#x27;s One Liberty Plaza was also built by the corporation as that city&#x27;s U.S. Steel Tower in 1973.

=== Steelmark logo===

When the Steelmark logo was created, U.S. Steel attached the following meaning to it: &quot;Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure and widens your world.&quot; The logo was used as part of a major marketing campaign to educate consumers about how important steel is in people&#x27;s daily lives. The Steelmark logo was used in print, radio and television ads as well as on labels for all steel products, from steel tanks to tricycles to filing cabinets.

In the 1960s, U.S. Steel turned over the Steelmark program to the AISI, where it came to represent the steel industry as a whole. During the 1970s, the logo&#x27;s meaning was extended to include the three materials used to produce steel: yellow for coal, orange for ore and blue for steel scrap. In the late 1980s, when the AISI founded the Steel Recycling Institute (SRI), the logo took on a new life reminiscent of its 1950s meaning.

The Pittsburgh Steelers professional football team borrowed elements of its logo, a circle containing three hypocycloids, from the Steelmark logo belonging to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) and created by U.S. Steel. In the 1950s, when helmet logos became popular, the Steelers added players&#x27; numbers to either side of their gold helmets. Later that decade, the numbers were removed and in 1962, Cleveland&#x27;s Republic Steel suggested to the Steelers that they use the Steelmark as a helmet logo.

U.S. Steel financed and constructed the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, New York, for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. It is the largest globe ever made and is one of the world&#x27;s largest free-standing sculptures.

===Chicago Picasso sculpture===
The Chicago Picasso sculpture was fabricated by U.S. Steel in Gary, Indiana, before being disassembled and relocated to Chicago. U.S. Steel donated the steel for the construction of St. Michael&#x27;s Catholic Church in Chicago since 90 percent of the parishioners worked at its mills.

===&quot;United States Steel Hour&quot; television program and Walt Disney World involvement===
U.S. Steel sponsored &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; television program from 1945 until 1963 on CBS. U.S. Steel built both the Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort and the Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Resort in 1971 at Walt Disney World, in part to showcase its residential steel building &quot;modular&quot; products to high-end and luxury consumers.

This same U.S. Steel manufacturing plant that was located on Disney property also helped build the now defunct Court of Flags Resort in Orlando, Florida, on Major Blvd.

===Real estate development===
U.S. Steel was also involved with Florida real estate development including building beachfront condominiums during the 1970s, such as Sand Key near Daytona Beach, Florida, and the Pasadena Yacht and Country Club near St. Petersburg, Florida.

==Facilities==

U.S. Steel has multiple domestic and international facilities.
Of note in the United States are Clairton Coke Works, Edgar Thomson Works, and Irvin Plant, which are all members of Mon Valley Works just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Clairton Works is the largest coking facility in North America. Edgar Thomson Works is one of the oldest steel mills in the world. The company acquired Great Lakes Works and Granite City Works, both large integrated steel mills, in 2003 and is partnered with Severstal North America in operating the world&#x27;s largest electro-galvanizing line, Double Eagle Steel Coating Company at the historic Rouge complex in Dearborn, Michigan.
U.S. Steel&#x27;s largest domestic facility is Gary Works, in Gary, Indiana, on the shore of Lake Michigan. For many years, the Gary Works Plant was the world-largest steel mill and it remains the largest integrated mill in North America. It was built in 1906 and has been operating since June 28, 1908. Gary is also home to the U.S. Steel Yard baseball stadium.

U.S. Steel operates a tin mill in East Chicago now known as East Chicago Tin. The mill was idled in 2015, but reopened shortly after. The mill was then &#x27;permanently idled&#x27; in 2019, however the facility remains in possession of the corporation as of early 2020.

U.S. Steel operates a sheet and tin finishing facility in Portage, Indiana, known as Midwest Plant, acquired after the National Steel Corporation bankruptcy. U.S. Steel acquired National Steel Corporation in May 2003 for $850 million and assumption of $200 million in debt. U.S. Steel operates Great Lakes Works in Ecorse, Michigan, Midwest Plant in Portage, Indiana, and Granite City Steel in Granite City, Illinois. In 2008 a major expansion of Granite City was announced, including a new coke plant with an annual capacity of 650,000 tons.

U.S. Steel operates Fairfield Works in Fairfield, Alabama (Birmingham), employing 1,500 people, and operates a sheet galvanizing operation at the Fairless Works facility in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, employing 75 people.

U.S. Steel operates three pipe mills: Fairfield Tubular Operations in Fairfield, Alabama (Birmingham), McKeesport Tubular Operations, in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and Texas Operations (Formerly Lone Star Steel) in Lone Star, Texas. A fourth pipe mill, Lorain Tubular Operations in Lorain, Ohio is no longer operating at this time.

U.S. Steel operates two major taconite mining and pelletizing operations in northeastern Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range under the operating name Minnesota Ore Operations. The Minntac mine is located near Mountain Iron, Minnesota, and the Keetac mine is near Keewatin, Minnesota. U.S. Steel announced on February 1, 2008, that it would be investing approximately $300 million in upgrading (project later abandoned) the operations at Keetac, a facility purchased in 2003 from the now-defunct National Steel Corporation. In December 2022, an investment of $150 million was made in the plant.

U.S. Steel has completely closed nine of its major integrated mills. The Duluth Works in Duluth, Minnesota, closed in 1973. The Worcester Works in Worcester, Massachusetts closed in 1977. The Ohio Works and Macdonald Works in Youngstown, Ohio, closed in 1980, the Duquesne Works in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, and Ensley Works in Ensley, Alabama in 1984, the Homestead Works in Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1986. Geneva Steel in Vineyard, Utah, was sold in 1987, South Chicago&#x27;s South Works closed in 1992, followed by the National Tube Works in Mckeesport, Pennsylvania, in 2014.

Internationally, U.S. Steel operates facilities in Slovakia (former East Slovakian Iron Works in Košice). It also operated facilities in Serbia – former Sartid with facilities in Smederevo (steel plant, hot and cold mill) and Šabac (tin mill).

U.S. Steel added facilities in Texas with the purchase of Lone Star Steel Company in 2007.

The company operates two joint ventures in Pittsburg, California, with POSCO of South Korea.

U.S. Steel added facilities in Hamilton and Nanticoke, Ontario, Canada, with the purchase of Stelco (now U.S. Steel Canada) in 2007. These facilities were sold in 2016 to venture capital firm Bedrock Resources and has since been renamed Stelco. The blast furnace in Hamilton has not been reactivated as they were shut down by U.S. Steel in 2013, and since has been demolished. The blast furnace in Nanticoke is now operating.

The company opened a training facility, the Mon Valley Works Training Hub, in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, in 2008. The state-of-the-art facility, located on a portion of the property once occupied by the company&#x27;s Duquesne Works, serves as the primary training site for employees at U.S. Steel&#x27;s three Pittsburgh-area Mon Valley Works locations. This site also served as the company&#x27;s temporary technical support headquarters during the 2009 G20 Summit.

In January 2021, U.S. Steel fully acquired Big River Steel in northeast Arkansas. In February 2022, U.S. Steel began construction of a new mill in Osceola, Arkansas, which is expected to be operational by 2024. The new Osceola plant will be adjacent to U.S. Steel&#x27;s Big River Steel. Together the facilities will be known as Big River Steel Works.

In June 2022, U.S. Steel signed a non-binding letter of intent with SunCoke Energy that would allow SunCoke to purchase two blast furnaces from U.S. Steel&#x27;s Granite City Works for use in pig iron fabrication.

===Railroad ownership===
U.S. Steel once owned the Northampton and Bath Railroad. The N&amp;B was an Shortline railroad built in 1904 that served Atlas Cement in Northampton, Pennsylvania, and Keystone Cement in Bath, Pennsylvania. By 1979 cement shipments had dropped off such that the railroad was no longer economically viable, and U.S. Steel abandoned the line. A section of track was retained to serve Atlas Cement. The remainder of the right-of-way was transformed into the Nor-Bath Trail. U.S. Steel also owned the Atlantic City Mine Railroad, whose line in Wyoming operated from 1962 until 1983 and served an iron ore mine north of Atlantic City, Wyoming.

Through its Transtar subsidiary, U.S. Steel also owned other railroads that served its mines and mills. Those properties included the Duluth, Missabe &amp; Iron Range Railway in the iron-mining region of northeast Minnesota; the Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern that served its Gary Works in northwest Indiana; the Birmingham Southern Railroad serving the U.S. Steel mill in Birmingham, Alabama; and the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie and Union railroads in western Pennsylvania that delivered iron ore and provided plant-switching services at its mill complex in Braddock, Pennsylvania and coke works in Clairton, Pennsylvania.

U.S. Steel also owned a large Great Lakes commercial freighter fleet, under the Pittsburgh Steamship Company, that transported its raw materials from the Duluth area to Ashtabula, Ohio; Gary, Indiana; and Conneaut, Ohio. The laker fleet, the B&amp;LE, and the DM&amp;IR were acquired by Canadian National after U.S. Steel sold most of Transtar to that company. The ships are leased out to a different, domestic operator because of the United States cabotage law.

== Corporate Social Responsibility ==
In January 2025, U.S. Steel received the Equality 100 Award from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HRCF) after earning a perfect score on the Corporate Equality Index (CEI) for the fifth consecutive year. The recognition highlights U.S. Steel’s commitment to workplace diversity and inclusion, its SteelPRIDE employee resource group, and its Culture of Caring initiative.

<text>Jamshedpur (; ), also known as Tatanagar, is a major industrial city in eastern India. It is the largest city in the state of Jharkhand. In terms of economy Jamshedpur has second largest economy in Jharkhand after Dhanbad. Jamshedpur stands as the third largest metropolitan area in the region. With a population of 629,658 in the city limits, the wider metropolitan area is home to around 1.3 million people. Located on the confluence of Swarnarekha and Kharkai rivers, Jamshedpur is surrounded by picturesque promenade Dalma Hills.

The modern city of Jamshedpur was established in 1912. It was named after industrialist Jamshedji Tata, who laid foundation of Asia&#x27;s first steel plant in the city and established Tata Group. The city played active role in the World War I. It was a high value target during the Second World War. Following the independence of India, the city became part of Bihar. Jamshedpur was impacted severely by the communal riots in 1964 and 1979. It was also a centre of the statehood movement. In 2000, the city became part of newly-formed Jharkhand state.

A major commercial and industrial center in India, Jamshedpur is demographically diverse city. It has been ranked consistently as one of the cleanest cities in India by Swach Survekshan. The city is also ranked as 2nd in India in terms of quality of life. It is one of the fastest-growing global cities in the world. It is a local popular tourist destination known for its forests, ancient temples and royal palaces. Jamshedpur is one of the first Smart Cities in India along with Naya Raipur. It is the headquarters of the East Singhbhum district and is the 36th – largest urban agglomeration and 72nd largest city in India by population. Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.

== Etymology ==
In 1919 Lord Chelmsford named the city, which was previously a village called Sakchi, Jamshedpur in honour of its founder, Jamshedji Nausserwanji Tata, whose birthday is celebrated on 3 March as Founder&#x27;s Day. J.N. Tata had written to his son Dorabji Tata about his vision of a great city in the area. On Founders Day, the 225-acre (0.91 km2) Jubilee Park is decorated with brilliant lightwork for about a week.

The city has several nicknames including &quot;Steel City&quot; (which was referenced during TATA Steel&#x27;s &quot;Green City—Clean City—Steel City&quot; campaign); &quot;Tatanagar&quot; after the name of its railway station Tatanagar Railway Station or simply &quot;Tata&quot; in deference to the presence of Tata companies. At one time it was also known as &quot;Kalimati&quot; (meaning &quot;Land of Goddess Kali&quot;) after the village near the Sakchi area. Sakchi was merged Jamshedpur as a neighbourhood in 1919. The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati Road.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early history ===

At the end of 19th century, Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata met steel makers in Pittsburgh to get the most advanced technology for his plant. It is said that he got the idea of building a steel plant after hearing Thomas Carlyle declare in a lecture in Manchester that &quot;the nation which gains control of iron soon acquires the control of gold&quot;. At the turn of the twentieth century, Jamshetji Tata asked geologist Charles Page Perin to help him find the site to build India&#x27;s first steel plant. The search for a site rich in iron, coal, limestone and water began in April 1904 in today&#x27;s Madhya Pradesh.

The prospectors C. M. Weld, Dorabji Tata and Shapurji Saklatvala, took nearly three years in a painstaking search across vast stretches of inhospitable terrain to find a location. One day they came across a village called Sakchi, on the densely forested stretches of the Chota Nagpur plateau, near the confluence of the Subarnarekha and Kharkai rivers. It seemed to be the ideal choice and the place was selected. In 1908 the construction of the plant as well as the city officially began. The first steel ingot was rolled on 16 February 1912. It was a momentous day in the history of industrial India.

The first world war began in August 1914. It rapidly escalated to West Asia centring around the Suez Canal of Egypt and from there to the region of Mesopotamia, now called Iraq. It extended to East Africa, Palestine and rest of the Middle East. Nearly 1,500 miles of rail and 3,00,000 tonnes of steel produced in Jamshedpur were used in military campaigns across Mesopotamia, Egypt, Salonica and East Africa. After the end of the war in 1919, the company received warm acclaim from Britain.

The city&#x27;s construction continued. Jamshedji&#x27;s plan for the city was clear. He envisioned far more than a mere row of workers hutments. He insisted upon building all the comforts and conveniences a city could provide. As a result, many areas in the city are well planned and there are public leisure places such as the Jubilee Park and Dimna Lake. While building the city, Jamshedji Tata had said,

Messrs Julin Kennedy Sahlin from Pittsburgh prepared the first layout of the town of Jamshedpur. What the city looks like today is a testament to his visionary plans. In 1919, the industrial neighborhood was merged to form Jamshedpur according to Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the industrial establishment. As a tribute to the company&#x27;s contribution in the war, on the day of city&#x27;s official opening, Lord Chelmsford visited and named Jamshedpur, in honor of Jamshedji Tata.
World War II started in 1939 in the European countries and extended to the Middle East and rest of Asia. The city was a high-value target for Japan during the war. The British government sought to protect the city from attacks. Several bomb shelters were set up across the city, while anti-aircraft guns were placed on the outskirts. British and American troops were brought into Jamshedpur. Additional airfields were built at Chakulia and Kalaikunda, surrounded by several underground bunkers. A series of wheeled armoured carriers, known as &#x27;Tatanagars&#x27;, contributing to the war effort, were manufactured in Jamshedpur. Between 1940 and 1944, a total of 4,655 Tatanagar units were produced at the Railway workshop in Jamshedpur. In 1945, Tata Motors was established as &quot;Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive&quot;, by purchasing the railway workshop.

=== Contemporary ===
A reminiscent of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place near Jamshedpur on 1 January 1948. Over 50,000 people assembled in Kharsawan and protested against the merger of Kharsawan. The Orissa Military Police opened fire on the crowd, resulting in a massacre. Aftermath of the incident, the bodies were disposed of in wells and in the jungle, many injured were left untreated. Official records state 35 deaths, but other sources, like P.K. Deo’s “Memoir of a Bygone Era,” suggest numbers as high as 2,000.

A violent strike occurred in May 1958 by the communist-led union of the Tata Steel. The state government declared it illegal. Within a week, the violence escalated into firing, looting, arson, curfew and movement of federal troops. According to the company, 4 people were killed and 114 people were injured. About 400 people were discharged and 335,000 man-days off work and 45,000 tons of steel production lost before mid-July when the steel plant returned to normal production.

In the mid 1960s, thousands of Hindus escaped anti-Hindu violence in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and sought refuge in India, which caused communal tensions in East India. The theft of a religious relic, believed to be a hair of Prophet Mohammed in Srinagar caused brutal riots in Jamshedpur. This led to a chain of protests, resulting deadly riots where 134 people were killed in Calcutta, Rourkela, and Jamshedpur. However, it is believed that the actual death toll was in the thousands. After the riots, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated groups were finally able to take root in Jamshedpur. Many Muslims living in company quarters were killed, which gave birth to new Muslim neighborhoods in north Jamshedpur.

In April 1979, Jamshedpur experienced a deadly Hindu-Muslim violence influenced by the presence of Hindu and Muslim communal forces. It was the first major riot on the occasion of Ram Navami. 108 peole were killed in the riot, among whom 79 Muslims and 25 Hindus were identified. A notable figure among the victims was Zaki Anwar, a popular secularist.

Legend has it that in the late 1980s when the state government proposed a law to end the Tatas&#x27; administration of Jamshedpur and bring the city under a municipality, the local populace rose in protest and defeated the government&#x27;s proposal. In 2005, a similar proposal was once again put up by lobbying politicians. The target audience was the working class. A large majority sided with the government and set up protest meetings outside the East-Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner&#x27;s office. However, the objective was never achieved and Jamshedpur remains without a municipality.

On 15 November 2000, Jamshedpur became part of new state called Jharkhand. There are wide roads, shady trees on the roadside, Dimna Dam for drinking water supply near the city, 24-hour uninterrupted electricity supply. Apart from this, many national level institutes like Shavak Nanavati Technical Institute, National Institute of Technology, National Metallurgy Laboratory, MGM Medical College, Al Kabir Polytechnic College are operating here. At present, Tata Steel is the country&#x27;s largest private steel production company producing 11 million tons of steel. Jamshedpur is the only city in the country whose basic facilities are taken care of by a private company.

Jamshedpur&#x27;s transformation from a rural area to a bustling urban center owes much to the establishment of Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited in 1907. Initially, its population remained modest until the 1921 census recorded a remarkable growth rate of 911.3%, attributed largely to immigration. People from various parts of India, notably Bihar, migrated to Jamshedpur in search of employment opportunities in industries and eventually settled in nearby areas. This influx diversified the city&#x27;s demographics, with significant communities from regions like Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, and Patna contributing to its multicultural character. Moreover, migrants from neighboring cities within Jharkhand, such as Dhanbad, Ranchi, and Bokaro, also flocked to Jamshedpur for job prospects. Alongside local residents, including Muslims and Sikhs, the city also became home to refugees who arrived during the partition of India, residing in designated colonies.

The 1974 Indian smallpox epidemic was partially traced to economic migrants returning from Jamshedpur. With funding from J.R.D. Tata, the World Health Organization quarantined the city&#x27;s unvaccinated population, successfully limiting further spread.

Dhalbhumgarh Airport is a proposed public airport located at Dhalbhumgarh, in the state of Jharkhand, India as a greenfield airport for Jamshedpur. It will be built on the site of an abandoned World War II airfield situated from Jamshedpur on NH-33. The old airfield was built around 1948, as an ancillary runway for other airfields in the vicinity that were being built around India&#x27;s eastern frontier as part of the war effort.

It was one of the airfields used by Allied forces to repel the advancing Japanese troops and to maintain transport links with China. As the Japanese forces came to control shipping in the China Sea, seaborne supply routes to China were cut and the difficult route over the Himalayas was increasingly used. The airfield was abandoned after the war. The technical team of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) conducted a survey in 2017 and approved the Dhalbhumgarh site for a greenfield airport. The government plans to invest Rs 300 crore through AAI for the new airport which will have a runway. In January 2018, Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha announced that the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the Jharkhand Government would sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of Dhalbhumgarh Airport.

<text>Tree sitting is a form of environmentalist civil disobedience in which a protester sits in a tree, usually on a small platform built for the purpose, to protect it from being cut down (speculating that loggers will not endanger human lives by cutting an occupied tree). Supporters usually provide the tree sitters with food and other supplies.

== About ==
Tree sitting is a strategy that provides a high level of public attention since it is considered to be very dangerous and requires highly skilled police officers to evict the sitters. Tree sitting is often used as a stalling tactic, to prevent the cutting of trees while lawyers fight in the courts to secure the long-term victories.

Tree-sitting was once a children&#x27;s pastime. In the early 1930s, when endurance contests raged across the U.S., it became a child&#x27;s contest for kids to climb into their backyard trees and, serviced by siblings and local businesses, attempt to win prizes for the longest sit.

==Extractions==
Tree-sitters in trees claimed by Pacific Lumber in Humboldt County have been subject to forced removal by hired &quot;extractors&quot;. The practice started with a single extractor in the late 1990s but in 2003 Pacific Lumber hired teams of climbers to remove dozens of tree-sitters, particularly in the Freshwater area East of Eureka, California.

Most of the extractions in Northern California are done under the leadership of Eric Schatz of Schatz Tree Service, a well known professional arborist.

In May 2021, RCMP forces in Canada extracted treesitters on Vancouver Island by flying a helicopter dangerously low above the trees and dropping ERT officers in the canopies or down on long lines to forcibly remove those occupying the sits. There was no communication, safety precautions taken, or research done into the stability of the sits prior to the helicopter landing. Until this point in time treesits had been extracted by girth hitching, shooting lines into trees, or waiting for those occupying the trees to come down.

==List of tree sits==
Some of the more notable tree sittings include:

=== US ===

* Waller Creek Tree-sit, October 22, 1969, Austin, Texas.
*Mikal Jakubal was an early American tree sitter. On May 20, 1985, he ascended a Douglas Fir in an area of the Middle Santiam region of Willamette National Forest that was in the process of being clearcut. While short-lived, his tree sitting action inspired a group tree sitting event by Earth First! activists that lasted from June 23 to July 20, 1985, when two Linn County, Oregon sheriff&#x27;s deputies wrestled Marylander Ron Huber from his tree after a day-long stand-off.
*In 1986, a treesitter preventing logging at Four Notch, Texas suffered a leg injury after the tree he was in was cut down.
*In 1989, a National Tree Sit Week series of actions was held at logging sites from August 13 onwards. This involved 12 tree sits in 7 states. A 3-day sit was held in Washington and a 4-day sit in Montana. Other states included Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, California and Massachusetts.
*In fall 1993, central wilderness of Idaho, the Cove/Mallard Timber Sale (the largest timber sale in USFS history), where vastly outnumbered Earth First activists attempted two tree-sits along proposed route actively being logged site of the Noble Road Logging Road, first of seven new roads to be built into untouched wild mountains. Loggers cut down around these first two tree-sits, laughing at and insulting the activists, a sight repeated later at another attempted cluster of tree-sits actions in 1994 in a Clear-Cut off Noble Road.
*In 2002, two US environmental activists involved in tree-sitting protests died in separate accidents.
*In 2006, 2007, and 2008, protesters in Berkeley, California sat in coast live oak trees to prevent the construction of a new sports facility by the University of California, Berkeley. On September 5, 2008, the university began logging the grove, after winning court agreement. Four days later, after a little more than 21 months, the final four tree sitters surrendered to authorities, ending the longest running urban tree-sit in history.
*In 2009, there were ongoing tree-sits in Humboldt County, Ca. to prevent logging of 100+ year old redwoods by Green Diamond (formerly known as Simpson). One of the tree-villages was defending the territory of an active Spotted Owl mating pair.
*In 2009, on August 25 two protesters with Climate Ground Zero halted blasting above Pettry Bottom in Raleigh County, West Virginia. Laura Steepleton and Nick Stocks climbed 80 feet in two trees in direct protest of Massey Energy&#x27;s mountaintop removal mine. The trees were located within 30 feet of the Edwight mine, and within the 300 feet of blasting. Kim Ellis and Zoe Beavers were arrested for providing direct support, only to return later that afternoon at the behest of state police to serve as liaisons for the sitters. Kim Ellis and Zoe Beavers were then asked to leave the site at 5:30pm by mine security, only to refuse and get arrested again by state police at 7:30pm. The tree sit halted blasting for six days while facing harassment from miners including threats of rape, trees being felled in close proximity, and chainsaws partially cutting the trees the sitters occupied.
*In 2010, on January 20 three protesters associated with Climate Ground Zero and Mountain Justice halted blasting on a portion of Massey Energy&#x27;s Bee Tree mountaintop removal mine on Coal River Mountain, West Virginia by ascending three trees, two tulip poplars and an oak tree. David Aaron Smith, 23 Amber Nitchman, 19 and Eric Blevins, 28 were on platforms approximately 60 feet up in direct protest of mountaintop removal mining and blasting near the Brushy Fork Coal Impoundment. Joshua Graupera, Isabelle Rozendaal, and Bernard Fiorillo were also arrested for providing ground support. The tree sit halted blasting for nine days. A federal judge granted a permanent injunction to Marfork Coal Co. Inc., a subsidiary of Massey Energy, ordering the defendants to keep off all company property.
* On July 20, 2011, two protesters associated with the RAMPS Campaign halted blasting on a portion of Alpha Natural Resources Bee Tree mountaintop removal mine on Coal River Mountain, West Virginia by ascending two trees, a tulip poplar and a northern red oak tree. Catherine-Ann MacDougal, 24, and Becks Kolins, 21, were on platforms approximately 80 feet off the ground within 300 feet of active blasting on the mine in direct protest of mountaintop removal mining. Becks Kolins stayed on their platform for 14 days while Catherine-Ann MacDougal remained for a total of 30 days making this the longest tree sit east of the Mississippi River. Elias Schewel and Junior Walk were arrested immediately for providing direct support on the ground. Criminal cases are still pending for the two sitters, while a civil suit seeking compensatory and punitive damages is pending for all four activists.
* In September 2018, the Yellow Finch tree sit was erected to block construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline and endured 932 days until March 2021 making it one of the longest-running aerial blockades in US history. Protestors were eventually extracted, arrested, and jailed.
* In May 2021, six tree sits were set up in the Caycuse Valley on Vancouver Island in British Columbia to protect a patch of old growth cedar&#x27;s estimated to be about 1200 years old. The longest sit lasted 9 days before being extracted by helicopter.
*Julia Butterfly Hill, an activist in Humboldt County, California, became known for her 738-day sit (from December 10, 1997, until December 18, 1999) in a , 600-year-old Coast Redwood tree she named Luna. Eventually, Hill and other activists raised $50,000 to spare her tree and place a buffer around it. Hill&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;The Legacy of Luna&quot; and the 2000 film &quot;Butterfly&quot; detail the Luna tree sit.
*In 2000, after spending two years in a thousand-year-old tree he had named &quot;Mariah&quot;, Nate Madsen descended. Both Pacific Lumber (PL) and the California Department of Forestry (CDF) signed off on the timber harvest plan, ensuring protection for Mariah for the time being.
*Manuel Esteban Paez Terán, also known as Tortuguita, was shot 13 times and killed by a Georgia State Patrol trooper during a raid of the Stop Cop City encampment on January 18, 2023.

=== Sweden ===
*During the Elm Conflict in Kungsträdgården in Stockholm, Sweden, in May 1971, many protesters sat in the nearby elm trees.

=== Australia ===
*In December 1983, the Nomadic Action Group (NAG) climbed trees to block work on the controversial Cape Tribulation to Bloomfield Road in North Queensland, Australia. When work resumed in August 1984, obstruction of road construction continued over a two-week period. Making use of hammocks, protesters were able to remain aloft, some for as long as a week at a time.
*In 1995, tree sitting took place during a blockade of logging at Jane Block in Western Australia before litigation protected the area.
*In 1986 and 1987, the Tasmanian Wilderness Society (TWS) obstructed logging operations at Farmhouse Creek in the Tasmanian South West Wilderness with tree sitters on wooden platforms. Tree platforms were later used on the Australian mainland during the South East Forests New South Wales campaign in Nullica State Forest (April–August 1989). Later in this campaign tree platforms in Coolangubra State Forest were erected to impede construction of the Wog Way and Kanoonah logging roads; those at Wog Way were occupied in continuous shifts from the beginning of September 1989 until October 1990.
*In 2004, at least six tree sits were erected in Tuart trees at Ludlow Tuart Forest near Busselton in South Western, Western Australia.
*In 2004, activists from Greenpeace and the Australian environmental organization The Wilderness Society held the record for the world&#x27;s highest tree-sit at 65m, in the Styx Valley, Tasmania. Peter (Peck) Firth spent 51 days up a giant Eucalyptus tree nicknamed Gandalf&#x27;s Staff.
*In 2006, two sits were built in Jarrah (Eucalyptus) trees at &quot;Arcadia&quot; Jarrah Forest near Collie in South Western, Western Australia. Two activists were removed and arrested but one had his charges dropped and the other went to court and was acquitted.
*In 2008, a tree sit was constructed in College Grove (remnant bushland), Bunbury, Western Australia, and was removed after being occupied for three months. Another was promptly constructed nearby in the next stage that was threatened by housing development; it included a functional trampoline.
*In 2009, environmental activists from the Still Wild Still Threatened group in Tasmania, Australia, were forced down from tree sits in the Upper Florentine Valley by police acting in conjunction with Forestry Tasmania in two separate busts in January and May. 
*On December 14, 2011, Miranda Gibson climbed up a 60m old-growth &quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot; tree in the heart of Tasmania&#x27;s southern virgin rainforest. Gibson vowed to stay until the forest is protected. The area was imminently due to be logged, despite being part of the area supposed to be protected under the fraught Forests Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). She was forced down from the tree 15 months later due to a bushfire.

=== New Zealand (Aotearoa) ===

* Native Forest Action used tree sitting during its campaign to save the West Coast, New Zealand native forests. In April 1997, the logging company, Timberlands West Coast Limited destroyed one of the sites by deliberately swinging a tree from a helicopter into it without ensuring that it was fully clear of protesters. The Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) cleared the helicopter pilot of wrongdoing in a controversial judgment that appeared to have been interfered with, according to leaked internal documents. 
* Tree sitting in 1978 (the first tree sitting action) led to the protection of what is now the Pureora Forest Park in New Zealand. Following a 100-person anti-logging protest in the Pureora Forest, a group stayed on to climb and occupy trees on January 18, 1978. Three days later more treesitters arrived and logging was suspended for safety reasons before an indefinite hold was placed on January 24. A full logging ban was introduced three years later.

=== UK ===
*In December 1993, an important moment in the campaign against the M11 link road in London was the occupation of The chestnut tree on George Green.
*&quot;During the 1994–1995 campaign against construction of the M65 the UK&#x27;s first tree village, including more than 40 treehouses, was built in the upper canopy of forest in Stamworth valley.
*Protestors took to the trees to resist the building of the Newbury bypass in England in 1995.
*In May 2006, protesters at Titnore Wood began a tree-sitting campaign against a major urban extension to the town of Worthing in West Sussex. Around 25 protesters created tree-houses and a network of tunnels. In March 2010, after nearly four years of tree-sitting, the local council voted unanimously to turn down the application for development.

=== Canada ===
*In 2001, two men lived in the 800-year-old Eik Cedar in Tofino on Vancouver Island&#x27;s west coast for 35 days during negotiations between the community, who wanted the tree saved, and the municipal council, plus the owner of the land adjacent to the cedar. Eventually, the tree was saved.
*In 1988, a treesitter set up a hammock to stop logging in British Columbia&#x27;s Sulphur Passage. Loggers shot him with pellets and cut the tree down, but he narrowly avoided major injury
*During Clayoquot Summer in 1994 treesitters held up logging for 25 days.

=== Germany ===

* From 1993 and 1998, tree sits and other forms of obstructive direct action were used to disrupt clearing and road construction at Dissen.
* During blockading against roadbuilding in Thuringen during September 1996 five separate tree sitting actions took place before the tactic was used again the following year.
*Starting in 2012, various sections of the Hambach Forest in Germany have been occupied to prevent the construction of the Hambach surface mine.
*October 2019 &quot;Dannenröder Wald&quot; was squatted by around 100 activists opposing planned logging of the old growth for construction of the A49 highway. The activists were democratically self-organized, without hierarchical leadership. They built more than 100 treehouses in several villages, so-called &quot;barrios&quot;, all over the forest, trying to prevent the destruction of the &quot;water protection area&quot; that provides water for 500,000 people in Frankfurt. They were evicted in October 2020, after more than a year of occupation.

=== Ireland ===

* In 1997, a six-month long occupation of a forest valley in Glen of the Downs, Wicklow saw Ireland&#x27;s first tree sits and tree huts set up to prevent clearing for road construction.

=== Netherlands ===

* In 1997, the Greenoord Free State was declared in Ruigoord to prevent clearing, and tree sits were established before the blockade was evicted by 850 people over a two day period.

==Tree villages==

A tree village is an extension of the tree sitting protest, involving several tree houses. The &quot;Fern Gully&quot; in Northern California lasted over 20 years, ending in 2008 with agreement not to fell the stand of old growth redwood trees.

==Tree houses==
In the United Kingdom, tree houses have sometimes been occupied for a year or longer. One treehouse, &quot;BattleStar Galactica&quot; at the Manchester International Airport, held 12 people. Such tree houses often have &quot;lock-on&quot; points for protesters to chain themselves to during evictions. Such tree houses have been used at Newbury bypass, Crystal Palace and Epsom.

<doc id="315813" wikidata="Q1046690" url="?curid=315813" title="Putout">
<text>In baseball statistics, a putout (PO) is awarded to a defensive player who (generally while in secure possession of the ball) records an out by one of the following methods:

* Tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base (a tagout)
* Catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out, or if done after a flyout, a doubling off)
* Catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play
* Catching a third strike (a strikeout)
* Catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout)
* Being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference

In a regulation nine-inning game, the winning team will always have a total of 27 putouts, as one putout is awarded for every defensive out made; this is one aspect of proving a box score.

While the abbreviation for putout is &quot;PO&quot;, baseball scorekeeping typically records the specific manner in which an out was achieved, without explicitly noting which player is awarded the putout for common plays. For example, a strikeout is recorded without noting the putout by the catcher, with additional detail only provided as needed. For example, &quot;Fryman struck out (catcher to first)&quot; in a play-by-play summary in reference to an out recorded following an uncaught third strike, which indicates the putout was credited to the first baseman rather than the catcher.

====Catchers====

Source:

Note: as the majority of putouts by catchers occur on strikeouts, most single-season putout records for catchers have occurred in recent seasons (excepting the shortened season), consistent with the increase in total strikeouts per MLB season (for example; 42,104 in 2021 compared to 34,489 in 2011).

<doc id="315824" wikidata="Q14859871" url="?curid=315824" title="Uridine monophosphate synthase">
<text>The enzyme Uridine monophosphate synthase (, UMPS) (orotate phosphoribosyl transferase and orotidine-5&#x27;-decarboxylase) catalyses the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP), an energy-carrying molecule in many important biosynthetic pathways. In humans, the gene that codes for this enzyme is located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3q13).

== Structure and function ==

This bifunctional enzyme has two main domains, an orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRTase, ) subunit and an orotidine-5’-phosphate decarboxylase (ODCase, ) subunit. These two sites catalyze the last two steps of the de novo uridine monophosphate (UMP) biosynthetic pathway. After addition of ribose-P to orotate by OPRTase to form orotidine-5’-monophosphate (OMP), OMP is decarboxylated to form uridine monophosphate by ODCase. In microorganisms, these two domains are separate proteins, but, in multicellular eukaryotes, the two catalytic sites are expressed on a single protein, uridine monophosphate synthase.

UMPS exists in various forms, depending on external conditions. In vitro, monomeric UMPS, with a sedimentation coefficient S20,w of 3.6 will become a dimer, S20,w = 5.1 after addition of anions such as phosphate. In the presence of OMP, the product of the OPRTase, the dimer changes to a faster-sedimenting form S20,w 5.6. These separate conformational forms display different enzymatic activities, with the UMP synthase monomer displaying low decarboxylase activity, and only the 5.6 S dimer exhibiting full decarboxylase activity.

It is believed that the two separate catalytic sites fused into a single protein to stabilize its monomeric form. The covalent union in UMPS stabilizes the domains containing the respective catalytic centers, improving its activity in multicellular organisms where concentrations tend to be 1/10th of the separate counterparts in prokaryotes. Other microorganisms with separated enzymes must retain higher concentrations to keep their enzymes in their more active dimeric form.

== Fusion ==

Fusion events between OPRTase and ODCase, which have led to the formation of the bifunctional enzyme UMPS, have occurred distinctly in different branches of the tree of life. For one thing, even though OPRTase is found at the &quot;N&quot;-terminus and ODCase at the &quot;C&quot;-terminus in most eukaryotes (e.g., Metazoa, Amoebozoa, Plantae, and Heterolobosea), the inverted fusion, which is to say OPRTase at the &quot;C&quot;-terminus and ODCase at the N-terminus, has also been shown to exist (e.g., parasitic protists, trypanosomatids, and stramenopiles). Moreover, other eukaryotic groups, such as Fungi, conserve both enzymes as separate proteins.
However important the fusion order is, the evolutionary origin of each catalytic domain in UMPS is also a matter of study. Both OPRTase and ODCase have passed through lateral gene transfer, resulting in eukaryotes&#x27; having enzymes from bacterial and eukaryotic origin. For instance, Metazoa, Amoebozoa, Plantae, and Heterolobosea have eukaryotic ODCase and OPRTase, whereas Alveolata and stramenopiles have bacterial ones. Other rearrangements are also possible, since Fungi have bacterial OPRTase and eukaryotic ODCase, whereas kinetoplastids have the inverse combination.

Merging both the fusion order and evolutionary origin, organisms end up having fused UMPS where one of its catalytic domains comes from bacteria and the other from eukaryotes.

The driving force for these fusion events seems to be the acquired thermal stability. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; OPRTase and ODCase activities lower to a greater extent when heated than the fused protein does.

To determine the driving force of protein association, several experiments have been performed separating both domains and changing the linker peptide that keeps them together. In &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;, the OPRTase-OMPDCase complex increases the kinetic and thermal stability when compared to monofunctional enzymes. In &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, even though separate and fused domains have a similar activity, the former have a higher sensitivity to conditions promoting monomer dissociation. Also, the linker peptide can be removed without inactivating catalysis. In Leishmania donovani, separate OPRTase does not have detectable activity possibly due to lower thermal stability or lack of its linker peptide.

== Regulation ==
UMPS is subject to complex regulation by OMP, the product of its OPRTase and the substrate for the ODCase. OMP is an allosteric activator of OMP decarboxylase activity. At low enzyme concentration and low OMP concentrations, OMP decarboxylase shows negative cooperativity, whereas, at higher OMP concentrations, the enzyme shows positive cooperativity. However, when enzyme concentrations are higher, these complex kinetics do not manifest. Orotate PRTase activity is activated by low concentrations of OMP, phosphate, and ADP.

== Mechanism ==

=== OPRTase ===

&quot;P. falciparum&quot; OPRTase follows a random pathway in OMP synthesis and degradation. Transition state analyses have used isotopic effects and quantum calculations to reveal a completely dissociated dianionic orotate structure, a ribocation, and a nucleophilic pyrophosphate molecule. Nonetheless, this is unexpected, since most N-ribosyltransferases involve protonated and neutral leaving groups, whereas deprotonated orotate is not a good one in the cationic transition state.

OPRTase, as a member of type I PRTases, has a prominent loop next to its active site. It is flexible in its open state and can hardly be seen in electronic density maps for some OPRTases. For catalysis to occur, a dimer must exist in which a loop from one subunit covers the active site from the other one. In &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;, a new pair of antiparallel β-sheets is created and five new interatomic contacts are formed in the loop, between the loop and the rest of the protein and between the loop and the ligands.

There are two possibilities as far as the loop movement is concerned: It could move in a rigid manner or it could come from a disordered structure that acquires order. The second scenario seems more likely to occur in OPRTase. There must be an energy balance between the peptide new order and hydrogen bond formation in the loop, between the loop and the rest of the protein, and between the loop and the ligands. There is a 30:1 equilibrium between the close and open structures in the enzyme-Mg-PRPP complex, which suggests that the close conformation is favored.

Various roles have been proposed to the catalytic loop residues. First of all, there seems to be a correlation between the loop movement and the substrate catalysis positioning. In the biological reaction, a proton transference to the pyrophosphate (PPi) molecule could minimize negative charge accumulation even though the pKa for PPi is 9. Lys26, His105, and Lys103 are candidates for this transference to the α phosphate position. However, it might not be the case, since lateral chains and the metal ion could neutralize some of the negative charge from the produced PPi. Transition-state geometric stabilization could also be gained through loop participation.

=== ODCase ===

Callahan &amp; Miller (2007) summarize ODCase mechanisms in three proposals. The first one is the substrate carboxyl activation through electrostatic stress. The phosphoryl group binding entails juxtaposition between the carboxylate group and a negatively charged Asp residue (namely Asp91 in &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;). Repulsion between the negative charges would raise the energy value near the transition state. Nonetheless, crystallographic analyses and the lack of &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; enzyme affinity to substrate analogues where the carboxylate groups is replaced by a cationic substituent have shown some evidence against this theory.

OMP protonation on O4 or O2 before decarboxylation, which entails and ylide formation on N1, has also been considered. Proton donor absence near O4 or O2 in crystallographic structures is evidence against it along with the ylide generation exclusion as a limiting step in 15N experiments. Moreover, doubts have aroused as to protonated intermediate viability due to electronic stabilizers absence. As a consequence, bond rupture between C6 and C7 due to protonation of the former going through a carbanion state has been proposed.

Finally, catalysis might take place by simple electrostatic attraction. C6 carbanion formation would create dipole interactions with a cationic Lys from the active site. This does not explain the velocity increase when compared with the uncatalyzed process.

== Clinical significance ==

A UMP synthase deficiency can result in a metabolic disorder called orotic aciduria.

Deficiency of this enzyme is an inherited autosomal recessive trait in Holstein cattle, and it will cause death before birth.

Deficiency of the enzyme can be studied in the model organism &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. The &quot;rad-6&quot; strain has a premature stop codon eliminating the orotidine 5’-decarboxylase domain of the protein; this domain does not occur in any other proteins encoded by the genome. The strain has a pleiotropic phenotype including reduced viability and fertility, slow growth, and radiation sensitivity.

== Pharmacological importance ==

UMPS and its two separate domains, ODCase and OPRTase, have been shown to be essential to viability in parasites from the Chromoalveolata taxon such as &quot;L. donovani&quot; or &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. Since UMPS, ODCase and OPRTase are different between organisms, research on species-specific inhibitors has been performed.

== Inhibition ==

=== OPRTase ===

Studies on OPRTase inhibition are based on substrate analogues. In &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, two of the most promising inhibitors are 2,6-dihydroxipyridine-4-carboxylic acid and 3-benzylidene-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-carboxylic acid. Union enthalpy and enthropy from the latter correspond to high-affinity ligands. Properties such as lipophilicity, solubility, permeability, and equilibrium constants are under study.

Selenilation products have also been used. Abdo &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) performed reactions on 2-ethoxiethanselenic acid using electron-rich aromatic substrates to produce (2-ethoxiethyl)seleno ethers. These are able to become aryl-selenilated products such as the 5-uridinyl family, which has shown inhibition at submicromolar concentrations in &quot;P. falciparum&quot; and &quot;H. sapiens&quot;.

=== ODCase ===

ODCase inhibitors also come from substrate analogues such as modifications on the OMP or UMP rings. In &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, ODCase has been inhibited by halide compounds derived from UMP (e.g., 5-FUMP, 5-BrUMP, 5-IUMP, and 6-IUMP.)

In &quot;Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum&quot;, a different strategy has been applied, modifying weak interacting ligands as cytidine-5’-monophosphate, which derivates into barbiturate ribonucleoside-5’-monophosphate, xantosine-5’-monophosphate. &quot;P. falciparum&quot; ODCase has been successfully inhibited by modifications on cytidine-5’-monophosphate N3 and N4.

<doc id="315826" wikidata="Q428200" url="?curid=315826" title="Iwakura Tomomi">
<text>was a Japanese statesman during the Bakumatsu and Meiji period. He was one of the leading figures of the Meiji Restoration, which saw Japan&#x27;s transition from feudalism to modernism.

Born to a noble family, he was adopted by the influential Iwakura family. By 1858 he was an advisor to Emperor Kōmei, but was exiled from the royal court from 1862 to 1867 for his moderation. After release, he became the liaison between the court and the anti-Tokugawa movement. He played a central role in the new Meiji government after 1868. He successfully opposed aggressive policies in Korea in the crisis of 1873, and was nearly assassinated by his enemies.

He led the 50-member Iwakura Mission for 18 months in Europe and America, studying modern institutions, technology, and diplomacy. The Mission promoted many key reforms that quickly modernized Japan. He promoted a strong imperial system along Western lines, and played a central role in creating financial institutions for the nation. 

The 500 Yen banknote issued by the Bank of Japan carried his portrait.

==Early life==
Iwakura was born in Kyoto, the second son of low-ranking courtier and nobleman, . Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Emperor Ninkō and descended from the 10th-century Emperor Murakami. His childhood name was Kanemaru but fellow court nobles called him Iwakichi (typically thought of as a commoner&#x27;s name). Confucian scholar Fusehara Nobuharu taught him Confucianism from childhood and suggested that adopt Kanemaru as his child. Tomoyasu did this In 1836, giving Kanemaru his own family name. In 1838, the boy changed his name from Kanemaru to Tomomi. In &quot;bakumatsu&quot;, most of the 137 court nobles had a long tradition. In contrast, the Iwakura house had only become independent from the Koga house in the early Edo period. This newness gave the Iwakura house lower status. It did not have a family business, so they had little money. Iwakura once showed his daring and disregard for the old customs of the nobility by making his home available as a gambling house in order to earn money. In 1839, when he was 14 years old, he had a coming-of-age ceremony and started to get involved in politics. He was trained by the &quot;kampaku&quot; Takatsukasa Masamichi and wrote the opinion for the imperial Court reformation. In 1854 he became a chamberlain to Emperor Kōmei, his first cousin once removed.

==As court noble==
As with most other courtiers in Kyoto, Iwakura opposed the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s plans to end Japan&#x27;s national isolation policy and to open Japan to foreign countries. When Hotta Masayoshi, a &quot;Rōjū&quot; of the Tokugawa government came to Kyoto to obtain imperial permission to sign the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan) in 1858, Iwakura gathered courtiers who opposed the treaty and attempted to hinder negotiations between the Shōgun and the Court. The imperial court and shogunate had a conflict because of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce. The shogunate agreed to sign the treaty, but almost the people of the imperial court had the opposite idea. However, Kujō Hisatada, an authority of the imperial court, supported the shogunate&#x27;s idea. Iwakura wanted to prevent the treaty of Amity and Commerce, so he decided to use an unusual method. In particular, he planned to have a direct talk with the &quot;Kanpaku&quot; by leading a lot of nobles. As a result of this, the &quot;Kanpaku&quot; agreed to prevent signing the treaty. This incident is called the demo of eighty-eight retainers of the Imperial court, and it made Iwakura famous. Two days later of the incident, Iwakura wrote a political written opinion. It was said that he wanted to postpone signing the treaty because he thought Japan needed to learn about the situation and customs of foreign countries. Also, he emphasized domestic consensus in the written opinion. In 1858, Ii Naosuke became Tairō and signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce without asking the emperor Kōmei. This angered the emperor, and the relationships between the imperial court and the shogunate became worse. Iwakura made an effort to find a way to settle peacefully.

After &quot;Tairō&quot; Ii Naosuke was assassinated in 1860, Iwakura supported the &quot;Kobugattai Movement&quot;, an alliance of the Court and the Shogunate. The central policy of this alliance was the marriage of the Shōgun Tokugawa Iemochi and Princess Kazu-no-Miya Chikako, the younger sister of the Emperor Kōmei. Andō and Kuze became &quot;rōjū&quot; and began to have power, and they suggested the marriage for the &quot;Kōbu gattai&quot;, the settlement of the imperial court and the shogunate. Although the shogunate ordered marriage of Kazunomiya and Iemochi, the emperor Kōmei opposed to this request because Kazunomiya and Arisugawanomiya had been already engaged. Also, he could not understand about &quot;Kōbu gattai&quot;. At that time, the emperor Kōmei demanded an opinion of Iwakura, because he knew that Iwakura was a talented person. Iwakura suggested that the emperor should let the shogunate promise the executing of the treaty withdrawal and allow the marriage of Kazunomiya and Iemochi. The emperor accepted Iwakura&#x27;s opinion, and the marriage of Kazunomiya and Iemochi was officially decided and the shogunate declared to execute &quot;jōi&quot;. &quot;Samurai&quot; and nobles who supported the more radical &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; policy saw Iwakura as a supporter of the Shogunate, and put pressure on the Court to expel him. As a result, Iwakura left the Court in 1862 and moved to Iwakura, north of Kyoto. Emperor Kōmei claimed that Iwakura was innocent, but could not stop people who supported radical &quot;Sonnō jōi.&quot; 

Iwakura decided to hide upon receiving a threatening message from Takechi Hanpeita from Tosa clans that if Iwakura did not leave the urban area of Kyoto, he would be exposed to Shijōkawara, which meant his death. He started to live in the Reigenji-temple in Nishigamo, where a grave of Iwakura ancestor was. On that day, he wrote about his despair in his diary. After that he found that the Reigenji-temple was not suitable for a long-term stay, so he moved to the Saihōji-temple. Moreover, the imperial court issued the order of expulsion from the city, so he had to move to Iwakura village. Sanshirō, a foster parent of Iwakura&#x27;s third son, suggested this place.

==In exile==
The exile continued for around five years. During exile, he had some connections with people who were familiar with politics. In Iwakura he wrote many opinions and sent them to the Court or his political companions in Satsuma Domain. For example, in 1865, Iwakura showed &quot;&#x27;Sōrimeichū&#x27;&quot;(叢裡鳴虫), a written opinion, to Ōkubo Toshimichi and Komatsu Tatewaki from Satsuma clans. He used this title to compare himself to an insect in the grasses. Moreover, he sent &#x27;&quot;Zoku：Sōrimeichū&#x27;&quot;(続・叢裡鳴虫) to Ōkubo and Komatsu. He claimed the importance of national unity for external crises. He relied on Satsuma clans because he found that they were capable people. Also, people from Satsuma clans had connections with the imperial court, so Iwakura tried to get them to send his written opinions to the imperial court. Responses of Nijō Nariyuki, a &quot;Kanpaku&quot;, and Satsuma clans were subtle. Iwakura was away from politics because of the penalty, so there was a difference between the Iwakura&#x27;s thoughts and the actual political situation. In 1866 when Shōgun Iemochi died, Iwakura attempted to have the Court seize political initiative. He tried to gather &quot;daimyō&quot; under the name of the Court but failed. When the Emperor Kōmei died the next year, there was a rumor Iwakura had plotted to murder the emperor with poison, but he escaped arrest. After the Kinmon incident, he returned to normal life, and his innocence was proved.

On October 15th, 1867, the shogunate, Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned his power to the imperial court. Yoshinobu worried about the external crisis and recognized the importance of national unity. In this situation, Ōkubo planned the coup that abolished the shogunate and &quot;sekkan&quot; systems. On December 8th, Iwakura participated in the &quot;kogosho&quot; meeting and talked about the disposal of Yoshinobu. During this meeting, Yamauchi Yōdō shouted, claiming that they should let Yoshinobu participate in this meeting and criticized a coup. It is a famous episode that Iwakura scolded Yamauchi because his attitude was rude, but this episode is a fiction. In fact, Iwakura could not easily convince Yamauchi, and their discussion was continued for the long term. Finally, Iwakura and Ōkubo convinced those who opposed the disposal of Yoshinobu.

With Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori, on January 3, 1868, he engineered the seizure of the Kyoto Imperial Palace by forces loyal to Satsuma and Chōshū, thus initiating the Meiji Restoration. He commissioned Imperial banners with the sun and moon on a red field, which helped ensure that the encounters of the Meiji Restoration were generally bloodless affairs.

==Meiji bureaucrat==

After the establishment of the Meiji government, Iwakura played an important role due to the influence and trust he had with Emperor Meiji. He put forward the emperor&#x27;s directly ruled government. He was largely responsible for the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath of 1868, and the subject abolition of the han system. Also, he established &quot;Dajō-kan&quot;. Moreover, he planned to move the emperor from Kyoto to Tokyo to make a new political environment. Some court nobles in Kyoto criticized these reforms, but he promoted these restorations with Sanjō Sanetomi despite their opposition.

Soon after his appointment as Minister of the Right in 1871, he led the two-year around-the-world journey known as the Iwakura mission, visiting the United States and several countries in Europe with the purpose of renegotiating the unequal treaties and gathering information to help effect the modernization of Japan. American newspapers reported that a visit by Iwakura was as important as a visit by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He failed when he discussed the revision of the unequal treaty with the U.S. president. The U.S. president pointed out that Iwakura did not have a commission of full powers. Ōkubo and Itō immediately returned to Japan on March 24 to get a commission of full powers and then returned to the United States on June 17. Despite their efforts, the United States was no longer interested in the revision of the unequal treaty at that time. 

During his travels, Iwakura was surprised at the economic prosperity he observed in western countries. He was especially interested in the railways. Also, he learned the importance of religious problems in the United States and he thought that the prohibition of Christianity was an obstacle to change the unequal treaties. Besides, he felt the danger of rapid Westernization, because he saw and learned about the merits and demerits of Westernization. At first, this trip was planned for 10 months and a half, but it took a year and 10 months in the end. A celebration was held in Manchester and Liverpool in 1997 to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Iwakura Mission.

Before the return of the Iwakura mission, the dispatch of Saigō to Korea was decided in a cabinet meeting. Generally, people thought that the dispatch of Saigō was too dangerous, but Saigō persisted in his decision. On his return to Japan in 1873, he was just in time to prevent an invasion of Korea (&quot;Seikanron&quot;). Iwakura opposed the dispatch because Japan also faced foreign issues concerning Karafuto and Taiwan. Also, Iwakura wanted to prevent the dispatch of Saigō to avoid foreign wars. Realizing that Japan was not in any position to challenge the western powers in its present state, he advocated strengthening the imperial institution, which he felt could be accomplished through a written constitution and a limited form of parliamentary democracy. Ōkubo supported Iwakura&#x27;s idea. In the next meeting, Saigō was absent to imply his disposal in case his claim would not be accepted. Sanjō Sanetomi, a prime minister was surprised about it and suddenly changed his opinion from the opposition of dispatch to the acceptance of dispatch. A lot of members including Iwakura criticized the sudden mind change of Sanjō, and they requested their disposal. Sanjō panicked and he became unable to work because he wanted to avoid every member&#x27;s disposal. Instead of Sanjō, Iwakura became the substitute of the prime minister and prevented the dispatch of Saigō. Due to this decision, some people had complaints, and Iwakura was attacked by nine people led by Takechi Kumakichi in Kuichigaizaka, Akasaka. He was slightly injured but severely damaged mentally. (Kuichigai Incident)
In 1873, Kido and Ōkubo raised written opinions about a constitution. Both opinions said that Japan should make a constitution as soon as possible, so to establishing a constitution became an urgent issue in Japan. In this situation, Ōkubo was assassinated in 1878, and Iwakura had to choose Itō Hirobumi or Ōkuma Shigenobu as a successor of Ōkubo. Itō wanted an absolute monarchy as in Germany while Ōkuma favored a constitutional monarchy as exemplified by the United Kingdom. Ultimately, Iwakura chose Itō and the German model as the basis for Japan&#x27;s constitution.

On 19 April 1876, Iwakura became the director of the Peerage Hall. However, in the early Meiji period, it was not clear what exactly they were doing, and as a result they were more independent than they were later on, and conflicts often occurred, especially between those from feudal lords and those from court nobles. It was like that. However, the nobility that Iwakura had in mind was a European-style aristocracy whose mission was solely to support the imperial family. Therefore, it was necessary to make all Chinese people understand that petty conflicts based on the old framework were pointless.

However, from around 1880 (Meiji 13), the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement gained momentum, and discussions on establishing a constitution accelerated. He ordered Inoue Kowashi to begin work on a constitution in late June 1881, and ordered Itō Hirobumi to Europe to study various European systems. In March 1882, Itō departed for Europe. Iwakura had high expectations for the investigation of Itō. On the other hand, during the dispatch of Itō, Iwakura worried that Itō might be really influenced by Germany. Although Iwakura accepted to make a constitution based on the Germany system, he wanted to make a constitution unique to Japan. Also, Iwakura wanted to cherish the Japanese tradition and emperor system. From such an idea, in 1882, He established an Internal regulation interrogation station to investigate imperial ceremonies and Japanese tradition, and offered the install of the National history compilation stations in 1883. This station aimed to translate Japanese history into English.

==Death==
However, Iwakura himself was unable to witness Ito Hirobumi&#x27;s return to Japan or the enactment of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan.

Although in poor health by early 1883, Iwakura went to Kyoto in May to direct efforts to restore and preserve the imperial palace and the buildings of the old city, many of which had been falling into disrepair since the transfer of the capital to Tokyo. Soon however, he became seriously ill and was confined to his bed. The Meiji Emperor sent his personal physician, Erwin Bälz, to examine Iwakura; Baelz diagnosed advanced throat cancer. The emperor personally visited his cousin and old friend on July 19, and was moved to tears at his condition. Iwakura died the following day at the age of 57, and was given a state funeral, the first ever given by the imperial government. Just before dying, Iwakura invited Inoue Kaoru over. Bälz and Inoue were with Iwakura until the end of his life. He was buried in Asamadai, Minami-Shinagawa.

== Personal life ==
Iwakura Tomomi&#x27;s height was about 160 cm. He was born in poverty, and he lived a simple life. He used to like Japanese sake and drank around 90 ml, three times a day. However, because of his health condition and food restrictions, he could drink western wine only instead of Japanese sake. During his life after retirement, he did not exercise at all, and ate very little to the extent he was compared to a bird. Iwakura was very particular about what to eat, and was fond of eating fish, meat, and vegetables, rather than beef and chicken. He also liked the cuisine of Kyoto, and turtle cuisine was one of his favorites. His hobby was Noh dance in plain clothes. He was an open-minded person who put himself in the other person&#x27;s shoes before forming any opinion. He had a wife, named Mineko, but she died on October 24, 1874. After Mineko&#x27;s death, he remarried Makiko Noguchi. He is an ancestor to actor Ken Uehara, singer Yūzō Kayama, and actress Emi Ikehata.

<text>José Gervasio Artigas Arnal (; June 19, 1764 – September 23, 1850) was a soldier and statesman who is regarded as a national hero in Uruguay and the father of Uruguayan nationhood.

Born in Montevideo, Artigas enlisted in the Spanish military in 1797 and fought the British in the Anglo-Spanish War. At the outbreak of the Spanish-American wars of independence, Artigas supported the Primera Junta in Buenos Aires against Spain. He defeated the Spanish royalists at Las Piedras and laid siege to Montevideo, but was forced to withdraw in the face of Portuguese intervention. Artigas subsequently broke with the centralist government of Buenos Aires and took over Montevideo in 1815. He then oversaw the creation of the Federal League, an alliance of six provinces under a federal style of government. In 1816, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves invaded the Banda Oriental, eventually annexing it as a province. Artigas was driven into Paraguay, where he lived in exile until his death in 1850. His remains were re-interred at the Central Cemetery of Montevideo in 1855, and in 1977 they were transferred to the Artigas Mausoleum.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Artigas was born in Montevideo on June 19, 1764. His grandparents were from Zaragoza, Buenos Aires and Tenerife (Canary Islands). His grandparents fought in the War of the Spanish Succession and moved to the Americas to escape from poverty, settling in Buenos Aires in 1716. Artigas was the son of Martín José Artigas and Francisca Antonia Arnal, who came from a wealthy family. His parents enrolled him in the &quot;Colegio de San Bernardino&quot;, to pursue religious studies, but Artigas refused to submit to the school&#x27;s strict discipline. Before he left the school, he developed a strong friendship with Fernando Otorgues, who would work with him in later years. At the age of 12, he moved to the countryside and worked on his family&#x27;s farms. His contact with the customs and perspectives of gauchos and Indians made a great impression on him. Once he had come of age, he distanced himself from his parents and became involved in cattle smuggling. This made him a wanted man among the owners of haciendas and with the government in Montevideo. A reward was put out for his death.

Things changed with the opening of the Anglo-Spanish War, and the threat of a British invasion upon the viceroyalty. The viceroy Antonio de Olaguer y Feliú negotiated a pardon with his family, on the condition that he joined the Corps of Blandengues with a hundred men, to form a battalion. Thus, he began his military career in 1797, at the age of 33, with the rank of lieutenant. The attack finally came in 1806, when William Beresford invaded Buenos Aires, in the first British invasion of the River Plate. Although Artigas&#x27;s unit was tasked with patrolling the frontier with Brazil, he requested to take part in the military expedition that Santiago de Liniers launched from Montevideo to drive the British out of Buenos Aires. His request was granted, and the British were defeated. After the recapture of Buenos Aires, he was tasked with returning to Montevideo and informing the governor Pascual Ruiz Huidobro of the result of the battle. A second British invasion was launched culminating in the Battle of Montevideo, which ended in the fall of Montevideo. Artigas was taken prisoner, but he managed to escape and took refuge in the countryside. He organized groups of &quot;gauchos&quot; and began a guerrilla war against the British. The British tried to capture Buenos Aires a second time. They were defeated by the local troops and returned Montevideo to Spanish control as part of the terms of capitulation. Artigas was promoted to captain in 1809.

===Oriental revolution===
The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the outbreak of the Peninsular War (from 1807 to 1814) in Spain, along with the capture of King Ferdinand VII, generated political turbulence all across the Spanish Empire. The absence of the king from the throne (replaced by the French Joseph Bonaparte) and the new ideas of the Enlightenment sparked the Spanish-American wars of independence, between patriots (who wanted to establish republics or constitutional monarchies) and royalists (who wanted to keep an absolute monarchy).
Artigas, who thought that the gauchos were not treated well, supported the new ideas.

Buenos Aires deposed the viceroy in 1810, during the May Revolution, replacing him with the Primera Junta.

Spain declared Buenos Aires a rogue city, and appointed Montevideo as the new capital, with Francisco Javier de Elío, who was an experienced hard-line colonialist from Cádiz, as the new viceroy. In February 1811, he declared war on Buenos Aires and this sparked the independence movement of Banda Oriental. Mariano Moreno, the Argentine secretary of war, wrote at the &quot;Operations plan&quot; that Artigas would be a decisive ally against the royalists in Montevideo, and called him for an interview. However, by the time Artigas arrived in Buenos Aires, Moreno had already left the government. He was still welcomed, but received little help. He was promoted to colonel and received some weapons, money and 150 men, very little to organize a rebellion at the Banda Oriental. This was the last time Artigas saw the city of Buenos Aires.

The alliance between Artigas and the Argentines sustained initial successes, particularly in the late 1810 to mid-1811. Montevideo had financial problems, however, and the measures taken by Elío to maintain the royalist armies were highly unpopular in the countryside. This allowed Artigas to channel the popular discontent against the colonial authorities. A hundred men met near the Asencio stream and made the cry of Asencio, a &quot;pronunciamiento&quot; against the viceroy. They captured many villages in the Banda Oriental, such as Mercedes, Santo Domingo, Colla, Maldonado, Paso del Rey, Santa Teresa and San José. They also captured Gualeguay, Gualeguaychú and Arroyo de la China, the west of the Uruguay River.

Elío sent some soldiers to kill Artigas, but they failed to accomplish their mission. Then, he sent Manuel Villagrán, a relative of Artigas, to offer him a pardon and appoint him general and military leader of the Banda Oriental if he gave up the rebellion. Artigas considered the offer an insult, and sent Villagrán prisoner to Buenos Aires.

Montevideo was soon surrounded by Artigas&#x27;s forces. A Montevidean army tried to stop the patriots at the Battle of Las Piedras, but they were defeated, and the city was put under siege. José Rondeau, commanding forces from Buenos Aires, joined the siege. Artigas wanted to attack the city right away, but Rondeau thought that there would be less loss of lives by establishing a blockade and waiting for the city to surrender. However, the besiegers did not consider the naval forces of Montevideo, who kept the city supplied and enabled them to endure the blockade.

On the verge of defeat, Elío allied himself with Brazilian forces, requesting their intervention in the conflict. Dom Diogo de Sousa entered the Banda Oriental, leading an army of five thousand men. This added to the Argentinian defeat of Manuel Belgrano at the Paraguay campaign, the defeat of Juan José Castelli at the First Upper Peru campaign and the Montevidean naval blockade of Buenos Aires. Fearing a complete defeat, Buenos Aires signed a truce with Elío, recognizing him as the ruler of the Banda Oriental and half of Entre Ríos. Artigas felt the truce to be treasonous. He broke relations with the city, and lifted the blockade over Montevideo.

Artigas left the Banda Oriental and moved to Salto Chico, in Entre Ríos. All his supporters moved with him. This massive departure is known as the &quot;Oriental exodus&quot;.

The Supreme Director Gervasio Antonio de Posadas offered a reward of $6.000 for the capture of Artigas, dead or alive. The only consequence of this action was increased resentment of the Orientals towards Buenos Aires. Several royalist leaders, such as Vigodet or Pezuela, sought an alliance with Artigas against Buenos Aires, but he rejected them: &quot;I may not be sold, nor do I want more reward for my efforts than to see my nation free from the Spanish rule&quot;. Despite the deep disputes, Artigas was still eager to return to good terms with Buenos Aires, but only if the city accepted a national organization based on federalist principles.

Posadas sent two more armies to capture and execute Artigas, but they mutinied and joined the Orientals. When the Artiguist influence expanded to Corrientes, Posadas sought to negotiate by accepting the autonomy of the provinces. Artigas accepted the terms, but clarified that such autonomy must not be understood as national independence. He did not want to secede the Banda Oriental from the United provinces, but to organize them as a confederation. Posadas, who supported the authority of Buenos Aires as the head of a centralized state, delayed the approval of the treaty.

Buenos Aires renewed the military actions against Montevideo. This time, the naval skills of Argentinian William Brown helped to overcome the strength of the Montevidean navy, leading to the final defeat of the royalist stronghold. Carlos María de Alvear led the capture of Montevideo, and lured Artigas there by promising that he would turn over the city to the Oriental patriots. Alvear attacked them without warning at Las Piedras, but Artigas managed to escape from the trap.

===Liga Federal===

In 1814, Artigas organized the Liga de los Pueblos Libres (&quot;League of the Free Peoples&quot;), of which he was declared Protector. In the following year, he liberated Montevideo from the control of the &quot;Unitarians&quot; from Buenos Aires.

In 1815, Artigas attended the Congress of Oriente, a year before the Congress of Tucuman, held in Arrollo de la China (today known as Concepción del Uruguay). It was at this congress that the provinces of the Oriental Province (today the country of Uruguay), Córdoba, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Misiones and Santa Fe declared themselves independent from Spain and formed the Liga Federal (&quot;Federal League&quot;). The Liga Federal invited other provinces of the former Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata to join them under a federal system.

In this congress, Artigas rectified the use of the flag created by Manuel Belgrano (which would later become the flag of the Argentine Republic), adding a diagonal festoon in red, the color of federalism in Argentina at that time, and changing the Borbonic light blue for Revolutionary dark blue.

===Luso Brazilian invasion===

The continued growth of influence and prestige of the Federal League frightened the governments in Buenos Aires (because of its federalism) and Portugal (because of its republicanism), and in August 1816, Portugal invaded the Eastern Province (with tacit complicity from Buenos Aires), with the intention of destroying Artigas and his revolution.

The Portuguese forces, led by Carlos Frederico Lecor, captured Artigas and his deputies and occupied Montevideo on 20 January 1817, but the struggle continued for three years in the countryside. Infuriated by Buenos Aires&#x27;s passivity, Artigas declared war on Buenos Aires while he was losing to the Portuguese. His subordinates, members of the Federal League—Francisco Ramírez, governor of Entre Ríos, and Estanislao López, governor of Santa Fe—managed to defeat the centralism of Buenos Aires. But hope for a new nation was short-lived; both commanders entered agreements with Buenos Aires that went against the principles of Artigas. They rebelled against him and left him to be crushed by the Portuguese.

Without resources and men, Artigas withdrew to Paraguay in September 1820. In Paraguay, Dr. Francia, the dictator, banished him to Candelaria. He then disappeared from the political life of the region.

After a long exile, he died in Paraguay on September 23rd in 1850, at age 86. It is said that Artigas, feeling himself to be near death, asked for a horse and died in the saddle, as a gaucho. His remains were buried and then re-interred at the Panteón Nacional in 1855. On 19 June 1977, his remains were transferred to the Artigas Mausoleum in the centre of the Plaza Independencia.

==Ideals==

Artigas was a staunch democrat and federalist, opposed to monarchism and centralism.

Artiguism has two main sources: the works of American authors such as Thomas Paine (supporters of federalism) and the French authors of the Enlightenment as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Some books Artigas read in his teens include Paine&#x27;s &quot;Common Sense&quot; and Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;The Social Contract.&quot; The first &quot;Caudillo&quot; or Founding Father of the La Plata territory seems to be inspired more in the British enlightenment than from the French.

The ideology of Artigas is partially taken from U.S. legal texts. The American political liberalism exerted a strong influence on Artigas. Other Hispanic independence leaders, however, were more influenced by the French Revolution and the authors of France. Some historians such as Eugenio Petit Muñoz and Ariosto González, have shown that some paragraphs of the Artiguist documents were taken directly from &quot;The Independence of the Mainland Justified by Thomas Paine, Thirty Years Ago&quot; published by Paine in Philadelphia in 1811 and translated immediately into Spanish, and &quot;Concise History of the United States&quot; by John McCulloch. Artigas had both books.

The first of the works cited contained a large appendix of documents with the United States Declaration of Independence, the Federal Constitution of 1787 and the State Constitutions of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

==Legacy==
Artigas has become a national hero in Uruguay. This is significant as, since independence, many Uruguayan figures have been heroes of either the Colorado or the Blanco party, while being reviled by the other side. As such, Artigas has been the namesake of numerous places, vessels, etc. throughout Uruguayan history, particularly during periods of peace and reunification between the parties.

<doc id="315833" wikidata="Q654588" url="?curid=315833" title="Kraven the Hunter">
<text>Kraven the Hunter (Sergei Nikolaevich Kravinoff; Russian: Сергей Николаевич Кравинов) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #15 (August 1964) as an adversary for the superhero Spider-Man. He since endured as one of the web-slinger&#x27;s most formidable foes, and is part of the collective of adversaries that make up Spider-Man&#x27;s rogues&#x27; gallery. Kraven has also come into conflict with other heroes, such as Black Panther and Tigra. He is the half-brother of the Chameleon and is one of the founding members of the Sinister Six.

In Kraven&#x27;s first appearance, he calls Spider-Man &quot;the most dangerous game&quot;, a direct reference to the 1924 short story of the same name, in which General Zaroff, a Russian big-game hunter (and a primary inspiration for the character), hunts people for sport.

Kraven is typically portrayed as a renowned big-game hunter whose goal in life is to beat Spider-Man to prove himself as the world&#x27;s greatest hunter. Though he is often overconfident in his own abilities, about which he likes to boast, he possesses a great sense of honor, and treats his adversaries as equals until proven otherwise. Because of this, Kraven has sometimes been depicted as an antihero and has teamed up with other heroes, including Spider-Man, the Avengers of 1959, and Squirrel Girl, in &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot; (2015–2019). The character is widely regarded as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most formidable enemies, and has gained considerable attention from storylines such as 1987&#x27;s &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt,&quot; 2010&#x27;s &quot;Grim Hunt&quot;, 2015–2019&#x27;s &quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&#x27;s Friend Kraven&quot;, and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Hunted&quot;. The mantle of Kraven the Hunter has also been assumed by Kraven&#x27;s sons [[Alyosha Kravinoff|Alyosha]] and [[#Last Son of Kraven|Sergei Kravinoff II]], and his daughter [[Ana Kravinoff]].

Since his original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrayed Kraven the Hunter in the Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU) live-action film &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot; (2024).

==Publication history==

The character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; issue #15 (August 1964), and was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Though he would occasionally appear in other characters&#x27; titles, he was most frequently used as a Spider-Man foe. He is killed off in the acclaimed 1987 storyline by J. M. DeMatteis, Mike Zeck, and Bob McLeod, &quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot;. Although generally considered to be the definitive Kraven the Hunter story, the story originally had a completely different character in Kraven&#x27;s role. Writer DeMatteis recounted:

Despite Kraven the Hunter being one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most long-standing arch-enemies, DeMatteis claims that none of Marvel&#x27;s editorial staff objected to the proposal to have him killed in the story. Kraven later returns as a ghost in the graphic novel &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man: Soul of the Hunter&quot;, also by DeMatteis, Zeck, and McLeod. DeMatteis also wrote &quot;Kraven&#x27;s First Hunt&quot; for &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; Annual &#x27;96, a retelling of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #15 which incorporated several DeMatteis retcons, such as that Kraven was abusive towards the Chameleon.

==Fictional character biography==
Sergei Kravinoff (Сергей Кравинов) is a Russian immigrant, the son of an aristocrat who fled to the United States with his family in 1917 after the executions of Russian nobility by the February Revolution and subsequent collapse of the reign of Tsar Nicholas II.

Kraven is a maniacal big-game hunter who seeks to defeat Spider-Man to prove that he is the greatest hunter in the world. Unlike other hunters, he typically disdains the use of guns or bow and arrows, preferring to take down large dangerous animals with his bare hands. He also lives by a code of honour of sorts, choosing to hunt his game fairly. He consumes a mystical serum to give himself enhanced strength and dramatically slow the aging process. Kraven was trained as a hunter largely by a mysterious man named Gregor, a mercenary who once battled Ka-Zar. Kraven was, at one point, the lover of the priestess Calypso.

He is contacted by his half-brother the Chameleon to defeat Spider-Man. He leads Spider-Man to Central Park with the help of the Chameleon, who disguises himself as Kraven to use himself as a decoy while the real Kraven ambushes the hero. However, despite Kraven having weakened Spider-Man with a poisonous dart, Spider-Man prevails in the end. Spider-Man proves a frustrating quarry because Kraven continually underestimates the superhero&#x27;s resourcefulness.

Kraven becomes a founding member of the Sinister Six when he accepts Doctor Octopus&#x27;s offer to form a team to fight Spider-Man. They capture Aunt May and Betty Brant. He attacks Spider-Man in Central Park with three tigers. Spider-Man fights off the attackers and secures the next clue to where Aunt May and Betty Brant are being held. After Aunt May and Betty Brant are rescued, Kraven the Hunter and the rest of the Sinister Six are arrested by the police.

While in the Savage Land, Kraven the Hunter finds Gog in a spaceship that he stumbles upon. Realizing how useful Gog can be, Kraven the Hunter decides to use him in a plot to conquer the Savage Land. After kidnapping the visiting Gwen Stacy from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes Ka-Zar and Spider-Man. While Ka-Zar deals with Kraven, Spider-Man defeats Gog by luring him into a patch of quicksand, which he sinks to the bottom of.

===&quot;Kraven&#x27;s Last Hunt&quot;===

Determined to end his life as he becomes older, frustrated with his failing health and continuing failure to defeat Spider-Man, Kraven sets out a final hunt for Spider-Man. After capturing Spider-Man, he shoots him with a coma-inducing drug and buries him alive on his estate. To complete his victory, he attempts to become Spider-Man&#x27;s clear superior by impersonating him in a brutal vigilante campaign and capturing Vermin, the one foe Spider-Man had never been able to defeat on his own (Spider-Man&#x27;s last battle with Vermin required Captain America&#x27;s assistance).

After Spider-Man emerges from his grave two weeks later, Kraven explains his actions to him and sets Vermin free. Spider-Man goes after Vermin to prevent his killing again. Kraven leaves a final confession of his crimes against Spider-Man and then commits suicide. Because of his suicide, his soul is unable to find rest until Spider-Man confronts his risen corpse on Kraven&#x27;s behalf.

===&quot;The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt&quot;===

Across &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; and &quot;Grim Hunt&quot;, Kraven is resurrected by his ex-wife Sasha Kravinoff and their children with a dark magic ritual using the blood of Spider-Man. Thoroughly unhappy and enraged with having been bestowed an unwanted revival, Sergei is shown to now be explosively psychopathic and cold towards his family, beating his son Vladimir and daughter Ana and expressing little attention towards his wife. After being stabbed by his daughter Ana, Sergei recovers, stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood which he calls &quot;unlife&quot;. They pull off the mask of the corpse of Spider-Man hung in their mantel and discover that Kaine had impersonated Peter in Spider-Man&#x27;s costume. Kaine&#x27;s nature as a clone indicates his unnatural existence has muddied the properties of the ritual. Spider-Man, in his black costume, confronts Kraven and the rest of the Kravinoff Family. Spider-Man is tempted to kill Kraven, who eagerly and desperately attempts to goad him into it. Beating him brutally, Spider-Man takes Kraven&#x27;s spear in hand and prepares to grant his enemy his wish but he refuses to do so when he is reminded by Julia Carpenter (who has inherited the powers of Madame Web after her death) that committing murder is not in his moral code, and furthermore, by going through with it, damns himself to a future where from that point he takes on a more brutal approach to crime-fighting, including killing suspects, which will lead him to die in a standoff against the police (a scenario previously glimpsed in an earlier issue). Following their defeat by Spider-Man, Kraven and his family escape to the Savage Land. While there, Kraven brutally kills Sasha (who complained that Kraven would have to hunt them to prove their place in the Kravinoff family) and euthanizes Vladimir. Alyosha flees in disgust of what his dad did to his stepmom and half-brother afterwards. Kraven and Ana discuss rebuilding the Kravinoff family, which leads to Ana running off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself worthy to Kraven and rebuild the Kravinoff family.

It was later revealed that back in the 1950s, Kraven the Hunter was a member of Nick Fury&#x27;s Avengers alongside Dominic Fortune I, Dum Dum Dugan, Namora, Silver Sable, Sabretooth, and Ulysses Bloodstone, tracking a stolen version of the Super-Soldier Serum combined with the Infinity Formula that had been stolen by a group of Nazis attempting to create their own Captain America.

While he is in the Savage Land, Agent Venom lands in the area on an unrelated mission from the federal government. Mistaking him to be Spider-Man, Kraven attacks him and gains the upper hand before Venom escapes.

At one point, Kraven is contacted by a doctor who once treated him when a past hunt went wrong, the doctor requesting that Kraven track down a recent patient of hers—who had been used as a test subject to duplicate another man&#x27;s electrical abilities—as well as asking that he capture the Black Panther—currently acting as a &#x27;local&#x27; vigilante to regain his sense of self after the destruction of Wakanda&#x27;s vibranium—in return for her help finding a way for him to die. With the aid of Storm, T&#x27;Challa is able to stay ahead of Kraven long enough to convince him that the doctor had lied about being able to kill him, Kraven agreeing to leave T&#x27;Challa alone and take the doctor&#x27;s mutated animal subjects back with him into the wild.

When their identities became fractured after a temporary separation, the Hulk discovers that Bruce Banner had hired Kraven to find the lost city of the Sasquatches. Although the Hulk was uninterested with helping the Sasquatches deal with Kraven, he changes his mind and beats up Kraven.

Kaine, in the alias of the Scarlet Spider, later encountered Kraven the Hunter, who was dressed as the Scarlet Spider to torment him. With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnapped Kaine&#x27;s friends to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivered Kraven a fatal blow in the chest, which paralyzed his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brought him back to life supposedly still breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappeared.

===&quot;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl&quot;===

Kraven, still claiming to be cursed, next battles Squirrel Girl at Empire State University, having earned her ire by lashing out at the local squirrels, including Tippy-Toe. Kraven departs when Squirrel Girl informs him of the existence of sea monsters like Giganto, playing on Kraven&#x27;s obsessions by challenging him to hunt worthier prey. He later returns to abduct Howard the Duck, but is trapped with Howard and Squirrel Girl in a manhunt as the hunted. After surviving, he vows to only &quot;hunt the hunters&quot;.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Kraven was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. who used Kobik&#x27;s abilities to turn Kraven into a zookeeper. He rallied some of his fellow inmates to help him find Kobik and bring her to Helmut Zemo.

In the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Zemo recruits Kraven into the Army of Evil. He raids the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; to uncover Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, but is defeated by Spider-Woman.

===&quot;Hunted&quot;===
In &quot;Hunted&quot;, Kraven the Hunter reminisces about how Sasha, Vladimir, and Alyosha were killed by him and Ana for not living up to his legacy. After cutting a deal with the High Evolutionary, Kraven the Hunter has 87 clones of him created, trained as the Sons of Kraven, and sent out to prove themselves by being hunted by each other. Only one clone survived, and was dubbed the Last Son of Kraven. With help from the Taskmaster, the Black Ant, and Arcade, Kraven hunts various animal-themed characters, like the Beetle, Kangaroo, Owl, Puma, the Serpent Society, Squid, and White Rabbit. Later, Kraven disguises himself as Spider-Man and tricks Last Son into killing him.

==Powers and abilities==
By regularly ingesting the potion made from various unnamed jungle herbs, Kraven grants himself superhuman physical abilities, making him a physical threat to Spider-Man, although these powers are not as developed as those possessed by Spider-Man. Kraven&#x27;s body is also more durable, and more resistant to certain forms of injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand great impact forces, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human, with little to no injury to himself. The effects of the potion have dramatically altered Kraven&#x27;s aging process to the point that he has aged little, if at all, over several decades. Despite being over 70 years of age, he has the physical appearance of a 30-year-old man.

The potion enhances Kraven&#x27;s sight, hearing, and smell to superhuman levels, adding to his already impressive tracking skills. He can see farther, and with much greater clarity, than a normal human. His hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling him to detect sounds which an ordinary human cannot, or sounds that a normal human could detect, but at much greater distances. Kraven can use his sense of smell to track a target by scent, much as some animals do, even if the scent has been somewhat eroded by natural factors.

Even without his superhuman powers, Kraven is an Olympic-level athlete, and a gifted tactician, hunter, and hand-to-hand combatant. He also has great knowledge of pressure points, both in the anatomy of humans and in many animals. He can strike at these nerve clusters with pinpoint accuracy, allowing him to incapacitate more powerful opponents or animals. He is familiar with many exotic poisons and tranquilizers, which he often uses during his hunts.

Due to a flaw in the ceremony that resurrected him, Kraven was given &quot;the &quot;unlife&quot;... the eternal curse&quot;, as he discovered when his daughter stabbed him through the heart. According to Kraven, he can now only die by Spider-Man&#x27;s hand. However, this curse was apparently broken when Kaine temporarily killed Kraven by stopping his heart and then restarting it with the same move.

==Family==
Kraven the Hunter had different family members and clones. He even fathered several children who have followed in his footsteps:

===Chameleon===
===Grim Hunter===
Vladimir Kravinoff was a son of Sergei Kravinoff, the infamous adversary of Spider-Man known as Kraven the Hunter. Unlike his illegitimate half-brother Alyosha Kravinoff who was raised in shame in Africa, Vladimir grew up in Russia benefiting from his father&#x27;s wealth and luxuries. However, their father often neglected both sons while he pursued his various international quarries. Unaware of his siblings, Vladimir was raised by Sergei&#x27;s servant Gregor who acted as a surrogate father teaching him Sergei&#x27;s hunting techniques. When Vlad was still a boy, Sergei put his son through a rite of passage, hunting Vladimir while disguised as the fabled &quot;Grim Hunter.&quot; Impressed by his son&#x27;s abilities learned under Gregor, Sergei began to train Vlad personally. Vladimir Kravinoff took up the name &quot;Grim Hunter&quot; and decided to hunt down Spider-Man and several of his foes. He only had one battle with Spider-Man, and his methods were nearly the same as his father&#x27;s. He was briefly involved with the Hobgoblin, even giving his identity of Jason Macendale his father&#x27;s super-strength formula which reacted to the anomalies in his bloodstream which gave him greater power. This is perhaps the reason why Vladimir became more powerful than his father when he took the treatment. When he got out of jail, he decided to track Spider-Man down again only to fight the Scarlet Spider instead. Kaine (a clone of Spider-Man) arrived and after a confrontation, Vladimir was killed by the insane duplicate. On death&#x27;s door, he staggered to Gregor falling in his arms and died shortly after that.

During &quot;The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt&quot; storyline, Sasha Kravinoff sacrifices Mattie Franklin as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir as a humanoid lion. Vladimir later assists Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff with capturing Anya Corazon as well as a second attempt to capture Arachne. Following Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s resurrection, Vladimir was shown attempting to attack Arachne and Araña while they are bound. Sergei fends off Vladimir rather brutally. Sasha mentioned to Sergei that Vladimir&#x27;s sub-human state was the result of a test resurrection to see if she can revive Sergei. After Spider-Man defeated the Kravinoff family, they escaped to the Savage Land where Sergei killed Sasha and Vladimir.

===Alyosha Kravinoff===
Alyosha Kravinoff is a mutant who is the second Kraven the Hunter some time after the death of Vladimir.

Unlike Vladimir, Alyosha was separated from his family and raised in an African jungle. After Kraven&#x27;s suicide, Alyosha came to New York City to investigate the father he barely knew. Dressed as Kraven, Alyosha confronted his uncle Dmitri Smerdyakov (AKA Chameleon). Believing his abusive half-brother had returned from the dead, Chameleon revealed to Alyosha much about the dysfunctional Kravinoff family. Kraven&#x27;s former lover Calypso Ezili did actually return from the dead and she mistook Alyosha for Kraven the Hunter. She seduced Alyosha, but afterwards he spurned her affections. Later, riding a bull elephant atop Manhattan&#x27;s rooftops, Alyosha attacked Spider-Man. He poisoned him with a hallucinogenic dart, but then set him free. While at the Kravinoff estate, Alyosha was learning about his father from Spider-Man when Calypso returned with Kraven&#x27;s tribesmen. She set the home ablaze and killed all but Gulyadkin the Lion. Calypso poisoned Alyosha and Spider-Man and used her hypnotic powers to force the two to fight to the death. Spider-Man resisted and injured Calypso, while Alyosha subdued her with his lion. Despite asking for her forgiveness, Alyosha savagely killed Calypso and all the tribesmen with her.

He was later hired by the city of New York to help capture the Fantastic Four&#x27;s enigmatic enormous canid Puppy. Next, he was hired by White Wolf, head of the deposed Wakandan secret police, to capture Black Panther. Black Panther turned the battle around, nearly killing Alyosha. Sandman later invited Alyosha to join Sandman&#x27;s Sinister Six to hunt Doctor Octopus and Senator Ward (the host body for the alien Z&#x27;nox). Venom, slighted at his rejection by the Six, hunted each of the team members. Refusing to be &quot;the hunted&quot;, Alyosha trapped Venom with fire, but Venom seriously injured him and escaped.

Alyosha then adopted a more relaxed, suave, and charismatic personality. As &quot;Al,&quot; he began dating Timber Hughes, an aspiring actress who worked as a waitress at an all-villain bar. Al sought to help Timber&#x27;s career in Hollywood by becoming a director. Despite celebrity connections, Al&#x27;s efforts were stonewalled by arrogance, greed, and corruption within the Hollywood elite. Forced out of Hollywood by the powerful Rothstein brothers, Al is beaten while Timber was brutally raped. Both Al and Timber exacted vengeance which involved defeating another half-brother Ned Tannengarden (who was later killed by Chameleon) and left Hollywood to pursue heroics in New York City.

Alyosha is one of few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after the M-Day. He is one of the superpowered beings recruited within the &quot;Beyond!&quot; miniseries by Stranger posing as the Beyonder.

Alyosha Kraven later eventually becomes fully deranged from experimenting with his father&#x27;s potions, and in his madness began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, including Bushmaster II, Gargoyle II, Tiger Shark, Kangaroo II, Aragorn (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), Vulture, Mongoose, Man-Bull, Dragon Man, Swarm, Mandrill, Grizzly III, Frog-Man, and Rhino. In the end, the Punisher (whom Kraven referred to as &quot;Tiny Monkey&quot;) managed to sabotage this zoo. Kraven himself escapes to the Savage Land.

During &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; storyline, Alyosha returned to New York to help his half-sister Ana and stepmother Sasha in the Grim Hunt by hunting Kaine. They then witness Spider-Man&#x27;s fight with the Lizard. He was present at the ritual where Sasha sacrificed Mattie Franklin as part of a revival ritual that resurrects his half-brother Vladimir as a humanoid lion-like creature. After the Kravinoff Family was defeated, Alyosha alongside the other Kravinoff Family members escaped to the Savage Land. Alyosha soon abandoned his family after Kraven killed Sasha and Vladimir. In an attempt to impress Kraven, Ana pursued Alyosha with the intent of killing him in exchange that he trains her to rebuild the Kravinoff Family.

Alyosha was later confirmed to have been killed in the Savage Land by his sister Ana when she and their father returned from the Savage Land to hunt down Kaine in Houston, Texas.

===Nedrocci Tannengarden===
There was a third son named Nedrocci &quot;Ned&quot; Tannengarden who tried to kill Alyosha, but he was murdered by the Chameleon (who, during that time, believed himself to be the original Kraven the Hunter).

===Xraven===
It was revealed during 2009&#x27;s &quot;X-Men/Spider-Man&quot; crossover miniseries that years earlier, Kraven made a deal with Mister Sinister. He and the Blob tracked down the X-Men, and they fought the united forces of Spider-Man and the original X-Men. Kraven fled after a short battle, but not before wounding each member of the X-Men. Kraven returned to Sinister, with genetic samples from Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, and Beast. Furthermore, Sinister requested from Kraven a sample of his DNA. Mister Sinister later cut a deal with Carnage to obtain a sample of the Carnage symbiote. After removing the sentience from the Carnage symbiote sample, Mister Sinister combined it with the DNA of the original X-Men and Kraven the Hunter, where he would use this creation at a later date. Years later after the death of Kraven, an ex-Morlock who had kept his powers post M-Day named Joe Buggs was murdered by a mysterious mutant hunter. His friend Ed (who had lost his powers) went to the X-Men for help. He claimed that the man who killed Buggs was Kraven the Hunter. Although they were skeptical about Kraven&#x27;s apparent resurrection, the X-Men called on the help of Spider-Man, who had battled Kraven many times over the years. After discussing the battle that they had with Kraven years ago and the fact that he had given samples of the X-Men&#x27;s DNA to Sinister for cloning, the lights went out on the wing where they were located. The hunter attacked and quickly dispatched Colossus, but was held at bay by Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing. He broke free, claiming his name is Xraven. The X-Men quickly realize that Xraven has all of the powers of the original X-Men, while also sporting retractable claws, big hands and feet, fangs, and wings that have a very flexible skeletal structure enough for him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing (Carnage&#x27;s DNA allowed the wings to be flexible). He was able to defeat Cyclops and Shadowcat, holding her hostage, giving the ultimatum that he would kill her if they did not surrender. Spider-Man insulted Xraven, claiming that Kraven would never threaten a helpless girl. Xraven was momentarily fazed by his comment, but attacked again, claiming that he is the &quot;favored one&quot;. Cyclops realizes Xraven&#x27;s weakness and tells him that Mister Sinister sees him as nothing but a pawn. He tells Xraven to read his mind, in order for him to see the kind of a man Sinister really is. After Xraven sees Cyclops&#x27;s memories, he flees, but the X-Men become aware of the fact that he was able to get DNA samples from Shadowcat, Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Wolverine. Returning to Mister Sinister with the samples, Mister Sinister tells him that he planned to clone a new generation of mutants, and that he would unite all mutantkind. After seeing what Sinister&#x27;s real intentions were in Cyclops&#x27;s memories, Xraven destroys the samples, claiming that Mister Sinister would breed slaves as opposed to warriors, and Xraven attacks him. Although it is clear that Mister Sinister survived his confrontation with Xraven, it is currently unknown whether Xraven survived.

Upon researching Xraven, Captain America does not consider him evil. He states that Xraven must be brought in, partly because of the murder he committed and partly to prevent the Kravinoff family from obtaining him.

===Ana Kravinoff===
The daughter of Kraven the Hunter, Ana Kravinoff becomes the first female to take on the name of Kraven the Hunter. She first appears tracking Spider-Man to his apartment, but mistakenly believes Peter Parker&#x27;s roommate Vin Gonzales was him. She then methodically ruins Vin&#x27;s life, and captures him. Despite Vin&#x27;s claims that he was not Spider-Man, Kraven prepared to hunt him, but was stopped by the real Spider-Man, who was wearing Daredevil&#x27;s costume (which had eyelids for him to be able to see). At the end, it is revealed that she is Kraven&#x27;s daughter by a woman called Sasha Aleksandra Nikolaevich (also the mother of the deceased Vladimir Kravinoff). She and her mother have recently set about forming an alliance of Spider-Man villains to get revenge on the wall-crawler and kidnap Madame Web. They also hired Deadpool to keep him distracted while they kidnapped Mattie Franklin. Ana and Sasha later meet up with Alyosha Kravinoff, who assists them in preparing for the &quot;Grim Hunt&quot;, where they start going after Kaine.

Ana assists her half-brother Alyosha Kravinoff into attempting to abduct Arachne, only to run afoul of Spider-Man, who repels them. Ana alongside Alyosha, Electro, and Diablo are present when Sasha sacrifices Mattie Franklin as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a humanoid lion creature. Ana alongside Vladimir and Alyosha attacks Anya Corazon, only to end up fighting Spider-Man, Arachne, Kaine, and Ezekiel Sims (who was really Ana&#x27;s half-uncle Chameleon in disguise). The Kravinoffs manage to overpower them and make off with Anya and Arachne. After Chameleon sheds his disguise and Spider-Man partially succumbs to the drugs the Kravinoffs have given him, Ana is present when Kaine (dressed as Spider-Man) is killed as a sacrifice as part of a ritual that revives her father Sergei Kravinoff. Following the resurrection, Sergei gets acquainted with his family. When Kraven returns after preventing Vladimir from attacking the captives, he is shown to lack a sense of control, attacking Ana until he is stabbed in the heart by Ana in self-defense. Sergei recovers, stating that Sasha restored him with corrupted blood or the &quot;unlife&quot; as he puts it. When the Kravinoff Family is defeated, Ana alongside the other Kravinoffs escapes to the Savage Land. After Sasha and Vladimir are killed by Kraven and Alyosha flees, she runs off to hunt Alyosha to prove herself to Kraven. She tells Kraven that if she can take down Alyosha, Kraven should train her and help rebuild the Kravinoff family. Otherwise, he will forget about family.

Ana later attacks Anya Corazon (who is now operating as Spider-Girl) in an attempt to finish the hunt she started during The Grim Hunt. Although obviously the stronger fighter, Ana is eventually defeated thanks to Spider-Girl&#x27;s experience at fighting in New York City. She is thereafter incarcerated.

Ana later escapes incarceration and heads to Houston to hunt Kaine (the current Scarlet Spider). Ana and her brother Alyosha deliver the killing blows to Kaine that lead to his blood resurrecting her father Kraven the Hunter. However, since Kaine himself was resurrected shortly afterwards so that there could be balance between Hunters and Spiders, it remains to be seen what other motives Ana has for Kaine as there are visions of a dark future ahead for the Scarlet Spider.

With the help of Ana, Kraven kidnaps Kaine&#x27;s friends to motivate the Scarlet Spider to fight him. In the end, Kaine delivers a fatal blow to Kraven, which paralyzes his heart. But using the same attack, Kaine brings him back to life, supposedly breaking the curse. Following the fight, both Kravens disappear.

Ana Kravinoff later serves as the guide to the Inhumans Gorgon and Flint, taking them to the Chimanimani Mountains of Mozambique, Africa, where they found the hidden Inhuman city of Utolan. During this time, Ana reveals that she has Inhuman ancestry on her mother&#x27;s side, something she discovered while hunting down her mother&#x27;s family members (and for which her father tried to kill her when she told him). She came to Utolan looking for a cure, but was sedated by order of the councilwoman Sanara, who took some of her genetic material for use in the city&#x27;s eugenics-based practices. Ana managed to escape and hunted down Sanara. She was exposed to Terrigen Mist during her hunt, which awakened her Inhuman genes. As she prepares to kill Sanara, Ana notes that it is time to &quot;embrace [her] nature&quot;.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Ana accompanies her father in hunting the New Men to draw out the High Evolutionary. When Ana learned that her father had the High Evolutionary make 87 clones of himself, Ana considers this a disgrace to the Kravinoff family and declares herself a &quot;Kravinoff no more&quot; which Kraven shrugs off.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Ana Kravinoff is discussed as a new recruit for the Sinister Syndicate. Kindred&#x27;s giant centipedes bring the Sinister Syndicate and Ana to Kindred where Foreigner&#x27;s group and the Superior Foes are, as Kindred holds a contest for someone to take down Spider-Man so that he can be punished for his sins. Ana is with the Sinister Syndicate when they intercept Overdrive, who was carrying Spider-Man away from Foreigner&#x27;s group.

===Sasha Kravinoff===
Kraven&#x27;s wife and Ana&#x27;s mother Sasha Kravinoff was part of a Gauntlet on Spider-Man&#x27;s life, causing chaos and weakening Spider-Man prior to the events that led to resurrecting Kraven from the grave.

===Last Son of Kraven===
The Last Son of Kraven (one of the many Sons of Kraven) was cloned from Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s DNA by the High Evolutionary. He hunted his fellow clones and returned to Kraven the Hunter, where he proved himself by presenting him with the skulls of his fellow clones. Kraven the Hunter sent the Last Son of Kraven to subdue and capture Spider-Man for the upcoming Great Hunt that is sponsored by Arcade&#x27;s company, Arcade Industries. The Last Son of Kraven later chased after the Black Cat. Kraven the Hunter donned the black Spider-Man suit, where he tricked the Last Son of Kraven into killing him. After attending his funeral of his &quot;father&quot;, the Last Son of Kraven went to the Kravinoff estate, ripped off his clothes, and trashed it out of frustration. After calming down and drinking some wine, the Last Son of Kraven found a letter written to him by his &quot;father&quot; behind Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s rifle on the wall. The letter from Kraven the Hunter stated that the Last Son of Kraven was to finally inherit his legacy not as Kraven&#x27;s son, but as the man himself, since he was cloned from his DNA. The Last Son of Kraven read in the letter &quot;You were forged in fire, born in blood. My spirit made flesh. More than my child—you are me, and I am you. One and the same now.&quot; This led to the Last Son of Kraven taking on the aliases of both Sergei Kravinoff and Kraven the Hunter, where he cuts his hair, wipes off his tiger stripes, and dons a copy of Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s costume.

==Reception==
&quot;IGN&quot; ranked Kraven the Hunter 53rd in their &quot;Top Comic Book Villains&quot; list. David Harth of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; described Kraven the Hunter as a &quot;cool villain&quot;, praising the design of the character, and described him as &quot;more than a match for Spider-Man.&quot;

<doc id="315837" wikidata="Q1753328" url="?curid=315837" title="Carnage (character)">
<text>Carnage is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually as an adversary of Spider-Man and the archenemy of his father Venom, in particular the Eddie Brock incarnation of the character, although Carnage and Venom have joined forces when their goals have aligned. The character made its first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #361 (April 1992), and was created by writer David Michelinie and artist Mark Bagley, although the first published artwork of Carnage was penciled by Chris Marrinan. Stan Lee would also have some input in the character&#x27;s name and attributes, pushing for a character who would be far darker and more vicious than Venom, due to the latter&#x27;s more scrupulous character development.

Carnage belongs to a race of amorphous parasitic extraterrestrial organisms known as Symbiotes, which form a symbiotic bond with their hosts and give them super-human abilities. Originating as an offspring of Venom, Carnage is much more powerful than its parent symbiote because of the symbiotes&#x27; biology, and is in many ways a darker version of him. Like Venom, Carnage has had multiple hosts over the years, but its most infamous one remains its first – killer Cletus Kasady, whose sadistic personality perfectly matches that of the symbiote. Other notable hosts include Ben Reilly, Karl Malus, and Norman Osborn, as well as Gwen Stacy in the alternate Ultimate Marvel continuity. The Carnage symbiote gave birth to its first significant offspring, Toxin, in 2004.

Since its original introduction in comics, the character has been adapted into other forms of media, such as television series and video games. Woody Harrelson voiced Carnage in its first live-action appearance in the film &quot;&quot; (2021), set in Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe (SSU), as well as portraying Cletus Kasady, reprising his cameo role from &quot;Venom&quot; (2018). In 2009, the Cletus Kasady version of Carnage was ranked as &quot;IGN&quot;″s 90th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

== Conception and creation ==
The Carnage symbiote was derived by writer David Michelinie while Mark Bagley designed the character. The symbiote was perceived to be a darker version of Venom, and was created due to the writers not wanting a replacement for Eddie Brock as Venom. Carnage was in part only created due to Venom&#x27;s immense popularity with fans. The character was originally meant to be named &quot;Chaos&quot;, until a different company came out with a character with the same name. Then &quot;Ravage&quot; was considered before Michelinie discovered Ravage 2099 was soon to be released. Finally, assistant editor Eric Fein suggested &quot;Carnage&quot;. Stan Lee would also have some input for the human host, having come up with the name &quot;Cletus Kasady&quot;, with the idea of Carnage&#x27;s host being a remorseless psychopath whose bond with his Symbiote was far more complete than Eddie Brock and Venom Symbiote&#x27;s, and therefore would refer to himself as &quot;I&quot; instead of Venom&#x27;s &quot;we&quot;, signifying his Symbiote had little agency of its own and acted more as a weapon and extension of Kasady&#x27;s will, maximizing his ability to murder people in creative and gruesome ways.

== Hosts ==
=== Cletus Kasady ===

When Eddie Brock&#x27;s Venom symbiote soon returned to be bonded again, allowing Venom to escape prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote felt no emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never communicated its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Cletus Kasady through a cut on his hand, transforming him into Carnage. The bond between the Carnage symbiote and Kasady was not as strong as the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. However, Cletus Kasady was also a serial killer and thought of as insane. As a result, Carnage is far more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom. Kasady and the symbiote would then be a main antagonist in &quot;Maximum Carnage&quot; and Kasady would continually be the most recurring character to use the Carnage symbiote in many publications.

=== Spider-Carnage (Ben Reilly) ===

The Carnage symbiote briefly managed to escape Kasady by traveling through the plumbing in his cell. It briefly used John Jameson as its host, but eventually transferred itself to Spider-Man— Ben Reilly at the time— when Ben bonded with it to prevent it from hurting any innocent people, creating Spider-Carnage. Ben&#x27;s willpower held out against the symbiote&#x27;s murderous desires long enough for him to return it to Ravencroft. Reilly subsequently attempted to destroy the symbiote by subjecting himself to a potentially lethal blast of microwaves, but it escaped back to Kasady after the microwaves forced it to separate from Reilly.

=== Superior Carnage (Karl Malus) ===

After Kasady was lobotomized, he was broken out of prison by the Wizard and Klaw, who intended to recruit him into the Frightful Four and turn him into their version of Venom. After a failed attempt to control Kasady, Wizard transferred the Symbiote to Dr. Karl Malus. Dr. Malus was enraged and under the influence of the Symbiote tried to kill his teammates, but he was subdued by Klaw and controlled by Wizard, who renamed him &quot;Superior Carnage&quot; and equipped him with weapons.

The trio are confronted by the Superior Spider-Man and during their battle the Wizard loses his control over Carnage and he is fatally injured once Spider-Man accidentally drops him due to the shock of finding out the Wizard read his mind and knows about Otto Octavius. Carnage, now free, goes on a rampage and starts to kill anyone in front of him. Klaw tries to stop him, but due to his weapon being damaged, he fails and realizes that the only way is for the Wizard to take back control. Both Carnage and Klaw make their way outside. Carnage fights the Superior Spider-Man and admits that although he liked using weapons, for him ripping and slashing the bodies is better. Klaw tries to get the Wizard to control Carnage again but is killed by Carnage and the explosion separates the Symbiote from its host, only to bond with the injured Wizard.

=== Red Goblin (Norman Osborn) ===

Following the events of &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, the Carnage symbiote was stolen from an old S.H.I.E.L.D. storehouse by the then-powerless Norman Osborn. He initially found himself overwhelmed by the symbiote&#x27;s desire for mindless slaughter when he allowed it to merge with him, but he has been able to &#x27;persuade&#x27; the symbiote to let him take control of Carnage&#x27;s powers to show it something other than &#x27;boring&#x27; mindless slaughter. Using this combination of powers during the &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; storyline, Norman is easily able to tear through Human Torch, Clash, Silk, Miles Morales, and Agent Anti-Venom, with the combination of the symbiote and the Goblin serum rendering Carnage immune to its traditional weaknesses, eventually transferring part of the symbiote to his grandson Normie enough to turn him into a miniature version of Red Goblin. The Carnage symbiote is seemingly destroyed by Spider-Man when he hits it with an exploding gas tank, however, because the symbiote was attached to Norman when Peter destroyed it, he wonders what sort of effect that might have had on his old foe&#x27;s mind. Later as Spider-Man visits Norman in Ravencroft, it&#x27;s revealed that Norman&#x27;s mind appears to have been completely fried and now believes that Spider-Man is Norman Osborn and he is Cletus Kasady. It&#x27;s not clear whether or not he&#x27;s faking it or if he had lost his mind. Meanwhile, Harry manages to remove the Carnage symbiote from Normie. Not all of it has gone.

=== Eddie Brock ===

Following the defeat of Cletus Kasady, the Carnage and Grendel symbiotes were absorbed by Eddie Brock, who is later given an offer to join the Avengers. However, in the middle of his big day, Carnage can overcome Venom and take over. Eddie leaves before things get out of hand, leaving the Avengers with strange reactions. Eddie returns home and tries to quiet the Carnage in a way he has done before with Venom, heavy medication. Eddie passes out and has a vision of Knull. This causes Eddie to take off and head towards the island where he long ago had thought he had killed Spider-Man and where he remained until the emergence of Carnage. However, Carnage catches on to Eddie&#x27;s thoughts and causes the plane to crash land. Separated from the Carnage symbiote, Eddie is ready to face it off. After a narrow escape that cost him his left hand, Eddie was eventually rescued by the Avengers, who promptly nuked the island to finally eradicate the symbiotes still on it. Meanwhile, to find his father, Dylan discovers a unique ability he has to track and control symbiotes, which he uses to find Eddie, and learns a terrible truth: Eddie never left the island at all. Instead, he has been bonded against his will to Carnage. Using the Venom symbiote and taking the form of a Tyrannosaurus rex, Dylan tries to separate his father from Carnage but only allows the Carnage symbiote to take Dylan to his father&#x27;s mindscape. There, Dylan is able to finally free himself and Eddie from Carnage&#x27;s control. However, the symbiote survives the ordeal, and is also able to leave the island by bonding with a shark.

=== Arthur Krane ===
Following the confrontation with the new King in Black, a piece of the symbiote survived and chooses a fish for a host and then attacks a shark. It eventually moves up the food chain and arrives on a fishing boat and begins again a killing spree. Inspired by what Eddie had done, Carnage formulated a new plan to make a comeback using the power Knull had bequeathed to create a rival Hive with itself as its nexus. Carnage slowly made its way back to New York – restoring itself by devouring everyone it came across en route. Once back in Manhattan, Carnage bonded to Senator Arthur Krane who was running a campaign to get Earth rid of aliens, both the good and bad type, and is working with Alchemax and the Friends of Humanity. Carnage also began to infect many of the symbiotes left behind on Earth with its will, including Phage, Lasher, Riot, and Agony. However, Carnage&#x27;s failed attempt to corrupt the Anti-Venom symbiote alerted Flash Thompson and Iron Man.

=== Other hosts ===
There have been other, shorter-term hosts for the symbiote.

==== John Jameson ====

Though bonded to Kasady&#x27;s bloodstream the symbiote found a way to abandon its host by travelling through the Ravencroft Institute&#x27;s water pipes overwhelming Ravencroft&#x27;s chief, John Jameson. Carnage used him to commit further murders before eventually bonding with Spider-Man (who was Ben Reilly at the time).

==== Carnage Cosmic (Norrin Radd) ====

During a subsequent rampage, the Carnage symbiote briefly attempted to take control of the Silver Surfer, who was visiting Earth at the time to welcome the Fantastic Four after their return to life following the battle with Onslaught. As it turned out, Galactus had consumed a planet that many Symbiotes lived on, and the species had made it a race memory so that each future Symbiote could remember it, as well as the Surfer who had been Galactus&#x27;s herald at the time. Upon seeing the Silver Surfer, the Carnage Symbiote abandoned Kasady and bonded with the Silver Surfer, becoming the Carnage Cosmic. Spider-Man and the Surfer managed to return the Symbiote to Kasady, who was dying from stomach cancer, and then the Silver Surfer proceeded to seal both host and Symbiote in an unbreakable prison in an attempt to force them both to reflect on their sins for eternity.

==== Scorn (Tanis Nieves) ====

After Carnage was ripped in half by the Sentry outside the Earth atmosphere it is later discovered that, although the host was presumably killed, the symbiote survived by becoming dormant and returned to Earth, where it was discovered by Michael Hall, a competitor of Tony Stark. He brought Shriek and her doctor, Tanis Nieves, so he could use Shriek to keep the symbiote alive to use the properties of the symbiote, to create prosthetic limbs and exo-suits which respond in the same ways as a symbiote. One such person, Dr. Tanis Nieves, is outfitted with one of these prosthetic arms after she is caught in an attack by the Doppelganger, who tried to rescue Shriek. When near the symbiote, her arm goes wild and forces her to kill several scientists before the symbiote forcefully bonds to her, becoming the new Carnage. After the symbiote uses Tanis to break into a Hall Corporation facility, it is revealed that Kasady is alive (although both of his legs have been severed), his body preserved by the symbiote and repaired by Hall&#x27;s prosthetics. Kasady reclaims the symbiote and becomes Carnage once more, attempting to avenge his captivity while Spider-Man and Iron Man struggle to stop him. It is then revealed that Carnage is once again pregnant, and the suit&#x27;s spawn briefly bonds to Tanis, but she removes it from herself and the symbiote bonds to Shriek before being torn from her. Scared of Shriek&#x27;s malice, the symbiote arm then rebounds to Tanis, creating a new hero, Scorn, who defeats Shriek and forces her to use her sonic shriek to weaken Carnage, but she escapes.

==== Wizard (Bentley Wittman) ====
Ultimately, Spider-Man brings out Kasady&#x27;s body to successfully draw the symbiote into it, which immediately devours Dr. Malus and then prepares to finish off the Wizard. However, Klaw&#x27;s ephemeral spirit focuses his sound manipulation powers one last time for a split second to create a powerful sonic blast that disables Carnage, allowing the symbiote to be recaptured. In the epilogue it is shown that the symbiote has managed to repair the Wizard&#x27;s and Kasady&#x27;s brain damage.

==== Carla Unger ====
After the symbiote had died in captivity, a sample of the symbiote was examined by Dr. Carla Unger, until the sample entered her body. When she went home, the symbiote formed around her and then she with the symbiote killed her abusive husband. After that, the symbiote consumed her and went to other hosts to get back to Kasady. When the symbiote arrived at an injured Kasady, a scientist, who wanted the symbiote for himself tried to kill Kasady, but the symbiote rebonded to Cletus.

==== Goblin Child (Normie Osborn) ====
==== The Crimson Leviathan ====
Carnage bonded to a great white shark to escape from the Isla de Huesos, and prowled the ocean for several months as the &quot;red king of darkness&quot;. Eventually it stumbled upon a boat full of whalers and seizing the opportunity, Carnage caught one of the whalers and bonds to him, climbed aboard and prepared to slaughter the crew, intent on taking its place as the Red Right Hand of the King in Black. At that exact moment however, Knull is killed by Eddie Brock, causing the symbiote dome encasing the Earth to shatter into countless symbiotes. Through the symbiote hive mind, Eddie, now the new god of the symbiotes, calls out to Carnage, who snarls for her nemesis to get out of his head. As symbiotes rain from the sky onto the ship and into the ocean, they bond to the crew of the ship and state that they are Venom, leaving Carnage shocked and incredulous. Manifesting an arm-blade, Carnage snarls that she&#x27;ll kill them all but is unceremoniously booted overboard. Interjecting, the Venom symbiote states that Knull is dead and that Eddie is the new King in Black, making Carnage now one of his subjects. As Carnage sinks back into the ocean, Eddie says she is not welcome in his reformed Hive and sentences her to execution. Countless symbiote-controlled sharks began swarming Carnage and devouring her in a feeding frenzy until the symbiote completely disappeared in the darkness of the ocean.

== Powers and abilities ==

As Eddie Brock explained, the Carnage symbiote was born with abilities even more singular than those of its progenitor due to the fact that it gestated in an environment alien to it: Earth. Carnage endows Cletus Kasady with physical strength greater than that of Spider-Man and the Venom symbiote combined and shape-shifting abilities, allows it to project a web-like substance from any part of his body including the formation of weapons, and enables it to plant thoughts into a person&#x27;s head using a symbiote tendril. Much like Spider-Man, Carnage has the ability to cling to virtually any surface, and has a version of Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense, as the symbiote can relay information to him from any angle and grants Kasady the ability to &quot;see&quot; in any direction, warning him of incoming threats. As a result, Carnage can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick surfaces. Carnage has abilities similar to those of Spider-Man as a direct result of Venom bonding to Peter Parker who transferred some of Spider-Man&#x27;s power into the symbiote.

Kasady is able to regenerate damaged body tissues much faster and more extensively than that of an ordinary human. This has been shown as powerful enough to allow him to regenerate from losing any part of body, from head to feet. However, after being torn in half by the Sentry, he was fitted with artificial legs, but this occurred while he was separated from the symbiote. Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote. Like Venom, Carnage is vulnerable to sound (to a much smaller degree than Venom) and heat (to a much larger degree than Venom), and is undetectable to Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-sense. Unlike Venom, Carnage can launch parts of itself at enemies in the form of solid weapons such as darts, spears, knives, axes, etc., although they disintegrate into dust within ten seconds of leaving Carnage&#x27;s body. Carnage also has the unique ability to warp its appendages into different arms, legs, and even wings. This is shown on several occasions when Carnage mutates fingers and arms into what look like large swords.

Kasady has full control over the size, shape, color (usually red and black), texture, and hardness of the symbiote (and any part thereof). Like Venom, he can make the symbiote look like normal clothing (which he has done on rare occasion), or act as &quot;camouflage&quot; to an extent. With the symbiote bonded to his bloodstream, he can &quot;regenerate&quot; his costume from scratch simply by bleeding. The symbiote has the peculiar ability to block its parent Venom&#x27;s ability to sense and track it. The symbiote is also able to rapidly adapt to new environments: when Kasady was taken into space by the Sentry, the symbiote was able to save his life by growing small sacks around his mouth that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen, allowing Kasady to stay alive long enough to be recovered.

In some interpretations, the Carnage symbiote is vampiric, feeding on and thus endangering its victims by only a mere touch. The symbiote has also shown the ability to call parts of itself back to the main symbiote, reintegrating them. It can also send irresistible commands to parts of itself that are in technology; these were used to break the bones of the Iron Rangers when they challenged Carnage while wearing symbiote-enhanced technological exo-suits. Using these last two abilities, Carnage absorbed the five Iron Rangers, grew to an enormous size, and became blue.

Finally, Carnage&#x27;s powers have always been abnormally enhanced from the maniacal will and insane worldview that Kasady has had from the age of 8 years old. Kasady sees chaos and random, undirected violence as reality, and considers order and virtue to be illusions. He takes an almost artistic pride in his mayhem, likes to leave a trail for others to follow (usually leaving the phrase &quot;Carnage Rules&quot; written in his blood), and is recklessly willing to take on the most dangerous and powerful opponents and victims. On rare occasions, however, he has deliberately spared individuals to serve as witnesses for others: for instance, Joe Robertson&#x27;s wife Martha during &quot;Savage Rebirth&quot;. Kasady is essentially taking revenge on the whole world for the torments, both real and imagined, of his childhood.

When the Carnage symbiote was joined with Norman Osborn, the resulting combination was immune to traditional symbiote weaknesses of sound and fire, although Anti-Venom&#x27;s touch was still dangerous.

=== Venomverse ===
In &quot;Venomverse&quot;, when Venom and Eddie Brock from Prime Earth were recruited into a war between lethal protectors from across the multiverse and the symbiote-eating Poisons, the Venoms from the multiverse were on the ropes until Eddie had the bright idea to recruit the psychopath Carnage to their side. They summoned a Carnage that hailed from a world where he had succeeded in killing Venom, and while he was volatile at first, engaging in battle with the Resistance, when he realized he had the opportunity to fight &quot;a buncha messed-up super-heroes&quot; he decided to join the Venoms. For some reason, Carnage was immune to the Poisons, and he helped tip the scales in their favor as one last-ditch suicide run and was left for dead alongside Poison Deadpool, and was seemingly killed when the Hive&#x27;s ship was destroyed after the heroes were sent back to their respective dimensions.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
The Ultimate Marvel version of Carnage is a self-regenerating vampiric organism. This version is created by scientist Ben Reilly from DNA samples of both Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and the Lizard, and combined with samples from Richard Parker&#x27;s symbiotic suit research, and nicknamed &quot;Little Ben&quot; Reilly after the scientist. When first introduced, the organism was a blob of instinct, with no intelligence or self-awareness, with its only aim to feed on the DNA of others, including Gwen Stacy, to stabilize itself. After feeding on multiple people, Carnage turns into a damaged form of Richard. Carnage and Peter battle to which Peter throws Carnage into a fire factor steel chimney, killing the beast. But before its death, the organism splintered into a replica of Gwen&#x27;s form.

In &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; #98, Gwen Stacy appears to have no memory of her &quot;death&quot; and believes she was in a hospital, from which she has escaped. In issue #100, after a raft of revelations, the stress of the situation enrages Gwen. She transforms into Carnage before leaping out the window. In the next issue, Richard Parker claims Gwen should not have met Peter at all, and was merely an experiment in stem cell research. This Gwen/Carnage fights with the Fantastic Four, Nick Fury, and the Spider-Slayers drones, until she is knocked unconscious by a beam of light, and taken into custody. In issue No. 113, the Green Goblin causes a massive prison break from the Triskelion. An inmate appearing to be Gwen walks out amidst the chaos, disappearing in the shadows. It was then revealed that Gwen&#x27;s mind had survived within the Ultimate Carnage after he &quot;drained&quot; her &quot;essence&quot; from her body, and following government experimentation, Gwen&#x27;s mind had become the dominant one within Carnage, reforming her body.

During the &quot;War of the Symbiotes&quot; storyline, Gwen/Carnage&#x27;s backstory in the Triskelion is revealed. It is shown Gwen has been taking some form of therapy. However, when the Goblin broke out of the Triskelion, Gwen escaped and went to Peter&#x27;s old house in a confused and terrified state, with Carnage&#x27;s face on her body. During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake the Venom symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Eddie on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie, but the Venom symbiote reconstitutes itself upon contact with Carnage and absorbs the &quot;Little Ben&quot; symbiote, seemingly killing it, and rendering Gwen an ordinary girl once again.

He and Venom travel to Counter-Earth to join the Synoptic, a hive mind of symbiotes, and ally themselves with the High Evolutionary while secretly helping the Synoptic grow powerful enough to infect the planet&#x27;s population with symbiotes. In the series finale, the two symbiotes succeed in unleashing the Synoptic on Counter-Earth.

** The first version is a mutated form of the Venom symbiote that appears in a self-titled second season episode and is created by the Green Goblin after injecting Peter Parker with a symbiote sample to turn him into the perfect symbiote. However, Peter&#x27;s cells create Carnage, an unstable organism that can generate spikes all over its body. Carnage ultimately leaves Peter&#x27;s body and is re-absorbed by Harry Osborn, who turns into Venom.
** The second version appears in the fourth season, &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six&quot;, as a similar creature. Introduced in the three-part episode &quot;The Symbiote Saga&quot;, HYDRA scientist Dr. Michael Morbius creates a weaponized symbiote that first envelops Doctor Octopus before Spider-Man and Agent Venom separate them. However, Carnage attains sentience and fights the heroes, resulting in it becoming a bomb and spreading all over New York, infecting multiple hosts, such as the Hulk and Shriek, until the Anti-Venom symbiote neutralizes Carnage&#x27;s swarm. Despite this, Carnage regenerates into a giant form which turns into an evolving hive of spiders and wasps led by Mary Jane Watson as the Carnage Queen. Spider-Man, Agent Venom, and the Patrioteer manage to separate them and seemingly destroy the symbiote. However, Watson retains traces of it, which she later uses to become Spider-Woman.

<text>were top-ranking samurai officials and advisors in service to the &quot;daimyōs&quot; of feudal Japan.

== Overview ==
In the Edo period, the policy of &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; (alternate attendance) required each &quot;daimyō&quot; to place a &quot;karō&quot; in Edo and another in the home &quot;han&quot; (feudal domain). A &quot;karō&quot; who was in charge of a castle was called the &quot;jōdai karō&quot; (城代家老), while the one in Edo was called the &quot;Edo karō&quot; (江戸家老). A general term for a domain-based &quot;karō&quot; is &quot;kunigarō&quot; (国家老).

Some domains referred to this position as &quot;bugyō&quot; (奉行) or &quot;toshiyori&quot; (年寄). The shogunate post of &quot;rōjū&quot; (elder) had many similarities to that of &quot;karō&quot;.

The famous samurai tale, &quot;Kanadehon Chūshingura&quot;, describes events involving a &quot;karō&quot;. The final Asano &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Ako &quot;han&quot; was Asano Naganori. While he was in Edo, he was sentenced to commit seppuku for the offense of drawing a sword against Kira Yoshinaka in Edo Castle. When the shogunate abolished the Ako &quot;han&quot;, all the Ako samurai became &quot;rōnin&quot;. Ōishi Kuranosuke, the &quot;jōdai karō&quot;, led 46 other &quot;rōnin&quot; in a vendetta against Kira. As a result of his leadership in the Forty-seven Ronin affair, Ōishi went down in history as the most famous of all &quot;karō&quot;.

== Harmful effects of the Karo system ==
Two to a few Karos are in the clan administration in a collegial system, but faction conflicts often occur in connection with political reforms and succession issues. Such a conflict became the cause of the &quot;house turmoil&quot;, and in the worst case, it could lead to improvement .

In particular, the confrontation between the karos, the elderly, and the magistrates who are trying to promote the reforms in an authoritative manner against the background of the lord&#x27;s trust, which was set up for the feudal affairs reform, and the conservative chief retainers and the priests who represent the opinions of the clan. It was a classic scene, and there were political disputes such as the fact that the clan theory was divided into two and led to a blood-washing conflict, and that the feudal lord was forced to retire with the fall of the reformist elders.

== Duty ==
Basically, he was allowed to stay away from home because of illness or old age, and remained in the post of a senior until he died once he took office.
usually, the person on duty is decided on a monthly basis, and the person on duty makes the decision. the person on duty is called the duty or the moon number by the clan. important matters shall be decided on a regular day by gathering at a Hyōjōsho, etc. and proceeding after a meeting.

== Notes ==
: Sankin kōtai (&quot;alternate attendance&quot;) was a policy of the shogunate during most of the Edo period of Japanese history. The purpose was to control the &quot;daimyōs&quot; (feudal Lords). Generally, the requirement was that the &quot;daimyōs&quot; of every han (province) move periodically between Edo (the Japanese capital) and his han, typically spending alternate years in each place. His wife and heir were required to remain in Edo as hostages. The expenditures necessary to maintain residences in both places, and for the procession to and from Edo, placed financial strains on the &quot;daimyōs&quot; making them unable to wage war. The frequent travel of the &quot;daimyōs&quot; encouraged road building and the construction of inns and facilities along the routes, generating economic activity.</text><links>

<text>Perlis (Kedah Malay (Perlis dialect): &quot;Peghelih&quot;), is a state of Malaysia in the northwestern coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is the smallest state in Malaysia by area and population. The state borders the Thai provinces of Satun and Songkhla to the north and the Malaysian state of Kedah to the south. Perlis is the only Malaysian state that is not divided into districts, due to its small size, but it is still divided into several communes. It was called Palit () by the Siamese when it was under their influence. Perlis had a population of 227,025 as of the 2010 census.

Perlis experiences a tropical monsoon climate. Much of the state&#x27;s highlands are part of the Nakawan Range, a subrange of the Tenasserim Hills system that spans through southern Myanmar, Southern Thailand and the Peninsular Malaysia, with Mount Perlis as the highest point at 733 m. The Nakawan also forms a natural frontier between Perlis and Thailand.

The capital of Perlis is Kangar, and the royal capital is Arau. Another important town is Padang Besar, at the Malaysia–Thailand border and Kuala Perlis, the ferry town to Langkawi. The main port and ferry terminal is at the small village of Kuala Perlis, linking mostly to Langkawi Island. Another important lately developed area is Pauh Putra within the subdistrict of Kurong Anai which houses the main campus of Malaysia University of Perlis and Politeknik Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin. Perlis has a snake sanctuary and research centre at Sungai Batu Pahat. Perlis State Park and Gua Kelam are among the popular tourist attractions.

==Etymology==
The origin of the toponym &#x27;Perlis&#x27; is vague. However, there are several theories:
* According to a Malaysian historian, Mohd Yusuf bin Adil, the name comes from the Thai phrase &quot;phrao loi&quot; (Southern Thai: พร้าวลอย) which means &quot;kelapa hanyut&quot; (coconut washed ashore) since there were many coconuts found on the shores of Kuala Perlis. The phrase has been shortened by locals until it sounded like &quot;pereleh&quot; or Perlis.
* It has also been suggested Perlis may be a shortened form of a Malay word &quot;peroleh&quot; (obtain) as the state was a &quot;gift&quot; from Kedah, since it was a part of Kedah before becoming a state on its own.
* According to &quot;Negeri Perlis Indera Kayangan: Sejarah Pembentukan Sebuah Negeri Berdaulat&quot; by Ahmad Ismail, the name comes from a tree of the same name, which may have gone extinct.
* Some researches suggests the name is derived from a northern Malay dialect word &quot;perelus&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;foot falling into a crack&quot;, since Perlis is said to have a wide land filled with mud, and the people&#x27;s feet may sink into the mud. 
* Additional suggestions include being named after someone, or derived from the French word &quot;perlite&quot; which means &quot;rock&quot; due to a huge rock near Sungai Perlis.

The honorific &quot;Indera Kayangan&quot; was given by Tuanku Raja Syed Hussin Jamalullail (who ruled Perlis from 1843 to 1873) after the royal town of Indera Kayangan II (1797 until 1813) he was raised in now located in Kampung Langgar, Kayang within the Kuala Perlis area. However, this epithet became less popular under the recommendation of Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail in 2015, in which according to him is inline with the official singular name given in the state constitution his father signed without any long epithets in general &quot;which is related to deities, or any &#x27;Darul&#x27;...&quot;&quot;.

==History==

Perlis was originally part of Kedah, although it occasionally came under the rule of Siam or Aceh. Perlis was historically an important realm within the Kingdom of Kedah. Sultan Muhyiddin of Kedah made his capital in Kota Sena, while Sultan Dhiauddin II made Kota Indera Kayangan his capital. Sultan Dhiauddin II of Kedah was honorifically titled as Raja Muda of Perlis and Kedah, akin to the title Prince of Wales in the United Kingdom. During his reign as the Sultan of Kedah, he oversaw a treaty with George Leith to cede Province Wellesley to Penang. He was titled as Raja Muda of Perlis and Kedah. This fact depicted Perlis was a special realm within the Kedah sultanate.

Sultan Dhiauddin then made Syed Harun Jamalullail, father of the future first Raja of Perlis as chieftain of Arau as a wedding gift to his marriage with his daughter, Tengku Sofiah. Syed Harun&#x27;s descendant eventually become deputy governor (1839) and Raja of Perlis.

After the Siamese conquered Kedah in 1821, the British felt their interests in Perak were threatened. This resulted in the 1826 Burney and Low Treaties formalising relations between the two Malay states and Siam, their nominal overlord. In the Burney Treaty, the exiled Sultan of Kedah, Ahmad Tajuddin was not restored to his throne. Sultan Ahmad and his armed supporters then fought in a series of war known as Perang Musuh Bisik for his restoration from 1830 to 1842. Towards the end of the conflict and the death of Siam&#x27;s Ligor governor in 1839 (Siam&#x27;s main authority figure over Kedah), Perlis was separated with Kedah.

In 1842, the Sultan agreed to accept Siamese terms and was restored to the throne of Kedah. However, Siam separated Perlis into a separate principality which was a direct vassal of Bangkok. The Siamese made Raja Long Krok as the Governor of Siam in Perlis while Syed (or Sayyid) Hussain Jamalullail as deputy governor. On 20 May 1843, the Siamese made Sayyid Hussain Jamalulail, the paternal grandson of a Hadhrami Arab Sayyid immigrant and maternal grandson of the Sultan of Kedah, the first Raja of Perlis which made Perlis a sovereign state. His descendants still rule Perlis, but as &quot;rajas&quot;, instead of as &quot;sultans&quot;.

In 1897, Kedah led by its prime minister, Wan Mat Saman began efforts to end the sovereignty of Perlis (similar to the Kingdom of Kubang Pasu which was absorbed into Kedah). After several tense occasions and disputes, the Siamese king Chulalongkorn sided with Perlis. Perlis also had several disputes with the state of Setul before the 1900s.

As with Kedah, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 forced Siam to relinquish its southern Malay vassal states of Kelantan, Trengganu, and Monthon Syburi (comprising Kedah, Perlis, and Satun (but Satun remained with Thailand)) to Great Britain. The British installed a Resident in the Perlis royal capital of Arau. Perlis was returned to Siam in World War II as a reward for Siam&#x27;s alliance with Japan, but this brief annexation ended with the Japanese surrender. After World War II, Perlis returned to British rule until it became part of the Malayan Union, then the Federation of Malaya in 1957, and lastly, Malaysia in 1963.

Since 2000, the raja has been Sirajuddin. He was the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) from 13 December 2001 to 12 December 2006. Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra was the Regent of Perlis during the five-year period when Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Chief Executive or &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; is currently Mohd Shukri Ramli of the Perikatan Nasional.

==Geography==
Perlis is the smallest state in Malaysia, covering a total land area of 819 km2. Like other west coast states, it has a coastline facing the Strait of Malacca, measuring around 20.4 km (12.7 mi) from Kuala Sanglang at the border with Kedah&#x27;s Kubang Pasu District up north towards the Malaysia-Thailand border near Pos Batu Putih, in the vicinity of Kuala Perlis.

From south to north, its topographical profile consists of flat, arable lands of the Kedah–Perlis Plain dotted with numerous mogotes, and abruptly rises up high as rolling karstic hills of the Nakawan Range, which forms the natural boundary between the state and the province of Satun on the Thai side. In general, paddy fields dominate much of the state&#x27;s landscape as the Perlisian portion of the Kedah–Perlis Plain had been utilized for rice farming since antiquity. Meanwhile, the Nakawan runs southwest–northeast along the Thai border from Kuala Perlis towards Kaki Bukit. The range is home to the 733-metre tall Mount Perlis, the highest point in the state.

===Climate===
Along with northern Kedah, the entirety of Perlis experiences tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification: Am). 
==Government==

Perlis is ruled by the House of Jamalullail. Unlike most other Malay states, in which the ruler is a &quot;sultan&quot;, the ruler of Perlis is called the &quot;raja&quot;.

Legislative power in the state is exercised by the Perlis State Legislative Assembly, a unicameral chamber in which all 15 seats are elected from single-member constituencies. After the 2022 state election, the Perikatan Nasional coalition, led by the Malaysian Islamic Party, holds 14 of the assembly&#x27;s 15 seats.

The raja appoints menteri besar (chief minister) and an Executive Council (akin to a Cabinet). Generally, the chief minister is a member of the legislative assembly who can command a majority on the assembly&#x27;s floor. The raja&#x27;s appointment powers were at the centre of a brief constitutional crisis in the state after the 2008 general election. The Raja sought to appoint a Barisan Nasional assemblyman, Md Isa Sabu, as chief minister despite Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, who led the national coalition, nominating the incumbent Shahidan Kassim to continue in office. The Raja prevailed, and swore in Md Isa, who proceeded to serve a full term as chief minister.

The state elects three members of the federal House of Representatives, for the constituencies of Arau, Kangar and Padang Besar. All three seats have been held by the Perikatan Nasional since the 2022 general elections.

The state also has two federal senators; like all other states, the senators are not directly elected but appointed by a vote of the state legislative assembly.

Perlis, being the smallest state by area in Malaysia, is not divided into administrative districts. It is, however, still divided into 22 mukims (communes), namely:

* Abi
* Arau
* Beseri
* Chuping
* Jejawi
* Kaki Bukit
* Kayang
* Kechor
* Kuala Perlis
* Kurong Anai
* Kurong Batang
* Ngulang
* Oran
* Padang Pauh
* Paya
* Padang Siding
* Sanglang
* Sena
* Seriab
* Sungai Adam
* Titi Tinggi (Padang Besar)
* Utan Aji; and

The Malaysian defines &quot;Malay&quot;, as those who are Muslim, speak Malay regularly, practise Malay customs, and lived in or have ancestors from Brunei, Malaysia and/or Singapore. Statistics from the 2010 Census indicate that 83.6% of the Chinese population identify as Buddhist, with significant numbers of adherents following Christianity (11.1%) and Taoism (3.4%), along with small Hui-Muslim populations in areas like Penang. The majority of the Indian population follow Hinduism (86.2%), with a significant minority identifying as Christians (6.0%) or Muslims (4.1%). Christianity is the predominant religion of the non-Malay bumiputera community (46.5%) with an additional 40.4% identifying as Muslims.

===Languages===
Majority of Perlis&#x27; population speaks Perlis Malay which is a sub-dialect of Kedah Malay but has its own unique features compared to those of neighbouring Kedah. Perlisian Chinese people are mostly Hokkien by ancestry and speak a dialect of Hokkien. Besides that there is also Hokkien, Mandarin, English, Tamil, Malayalam as well as small numbers of Southern Thai speakers, mostly ethnic Malaysian Siamese. However, large numbers of Perlisians regardless of ethnic origin mainly uses Perlis Malay as a lingua franca. In particular, Perlis is well known for its distinctive Hokkien language, known as Penang Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the lingua franca among the various ethnic Chinese communities in Perlis. Perlis Chinese are predominantly Hokkien and thus mostly speak Hokkien as their first language.

<doc id="315845" wikidata="Q5419945" url="?curid=315845" title="Executive privilege">
<text>Executive privilege is the right of the president of the United States and other members of the executive branch to maintain confidential communications under certain circumstances within the executive branch and to resist some subpoenas and other oversight by the legislative and judicial branches of government in pursuit of particular information or personnel relating to those confidential communications. The right comes into effect when revealing the information would impair governmental functions. Neither executive privilege nor the oversight power of Congress is explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. However, the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that executive privilege and congressional oversight each are a consequence of the doctrine of the separation of powers, derived from the supremacy of each branch in its area of constitutional activity.

The Supreme Court confirmed the legitimacy of this doctrine in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot; in the context of a subpoena emanating from the judiciary instead of emanating from Congress. The Court held that there is a qualified privilege, which once invoked, creates a presumption of privilege, and the party seeking the documents must then make a &quot;sufficient showing&quot; that the &quot;presidential material&quot; is &quot;essential to the justice of the case&quot;. Chief Justice Warren Burger further stated that executive privilege would most effectively apply when the oversight of the executive would impair that branch&#x27;s national security concerns. Regarding requests from Congress (instead of from the courts) for executive branch information, as of a 2014 study by the Congressional Research Service, only two federal court cases had addressed the merits of executive privilege in such a context, and neither of those cases reached the Supreme Court.

In addition to which branch of government is requesting the information, another characteristic of executive privilege is whether it involves a &quot;presidential communications privilege&quot; or instead a &quot;deliberative process privilege&quot; or some other type of privilege. The deliberative process privilege is often considered to be rooted in common law. In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is often considered rooted in the separation of powers, thus making the deliberative process privilege less difficult to overcome. Generally speaking, presidents, congresses and courts have historically tended to sidestep open confrontations through compromise and mutual deference because of previous practice and precedents regarding the exercise of executive privilege.

==Early precedents==
Deliberative process privilege is a specific instance of the more general principle of executive privilege. It is usually considered to be based upon common law rather than separation of powers, and its history traces back to the English crown privilege (now known as public-interest immunity). In contrast, the presidential communications privilege is another specific instance of executive privilege, usually considered based upon the separation of powers. Therefore, it is more difficult to overcome than the deliberative process privilege. A significant requirement of the presidential communications privilege is that it can only protect communications sent or received by the president or his immediate advisors. In contrast, the deliberative process privilege may extend further down the chain of command.

In the context of privilege assertions by United States presidents, law professor Michael Dorf has written: &quot;In 1796, President George Washington refused to comply with a request by the House of Representatives for documents related to the negotiation of the then-recently adopted Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain. Washington reasoned that the Senate alone plays a role in the ratification of treaties, and therefore the House had no legitimate claim to the material. Therefore, Washington provided the documents to the Senate but not the House.&quot;

President Thomas Jefferson continued the precedent for this in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason in 1809. Burr asked the court to issue a &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; to compel Jefferson to testify or provide his private letters concerning Burr. Chief Justice John Marshall, a strong proponent of the powers of the federal government but also a political opponent of Jefferson, ruled that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, which allows for these sorts of court orders for criminal defendants, did not provide any exception for the president. As for Jefferson&#x27;s claim that disclosure of the document would imperil public safety, Marshall held that the court, not the president, would be the judge of that. Jefferson refused to testify personally but provided selected letters.

In 1833, President Andrew Jackson cited executive privilege when Senator Henry Clay demanded that he produce documents concerning statements the president made to his cabinet about the removal of federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States during the Bank War.

==Cold War era==
During 1947–49, several major security cases became known to Congress. There followed a series of investigations, culminating in the famous Hiss–Chambers case of 1948. At that point, the Truman Administration issued a sweeping secrecy order blocking congressional efforts from FBI and other executive data on security problems. Security files were moved to the White House and Administration officials were banned from testifying before Congress on security related matters. Investigation of the State Department and other cases was stymied, and the matter was left unresolved.

During the Army–McCarthy hearings in 1954, Eisenhower used the claim of executive privilege to forbid the &quot;provision of any data about internal conversations, meetings, or written communication among staffers, with no exception to topics or people.&quot; Department of Defense employees were also instructed not to testify on such conversations or produce any such documents or reproductions. This was done to refuse the McCarthy Committee subpoenas of transcripts of monitored telephone calls from Army officials, as well as information on meetings between Eisenhower officials relating to the hearings. This was done in the form of a letter from Eisenhower to the Department of Defense and an accompanying memo from Eisenhower Justice. The reasoning behind the order was that there was a need for &quot;candid&quot; exchanges among executive employees in giving &quot;advice&quot; to one another. In the end, Eisenhower invoked the claim 44 times between 1955 and 1960.

==&quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;==

The Supreme Court addressed executive privilege in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, the 1974 case involving the demand by Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox that President Richard Nixon produce the audiotapes of conversations he and his colleagues had in the Oval Office of the White House in connection with criminal charges being brought against members of the Nixon Administration for breaking into the Watergate complex. President Nixon invoked the privilege and refused to produce any records.

The Supreme Court did not reject the claim of privilege out of hand; it noted, in fact, &quot;the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties&quot; and that &quot;[h]uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process.&quot; The Supreme Court stated: &quot;To read the Article II powers of the president as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of &#x27;a workable government&#x27; and gravely impair the role of the courts under Article III.&quot; Because Nixon had asserted only a generalized need for confidentiality, the Court held that the more considerable public interest in obtaining the truth in the context of a criminal prosecution took precedence.

==Post-Watergate era==
===Ford administration===
In the wake of Nixon&#x27;s heavy use of executive privilege to block investigations of his actions, Ford was scrupulous in minimizing its usage. However, that complicated his efforts to keep congressional investigations under control. Political scientist Mark J. Rozell concludes that Ford&#x27;s:
: failure to enunciate a formal executive privilege policy made it more difficult to explain his position to Congress. He concludes that Ford&#x27;s actions were prudent; they likely salvaged executive privilege from the graveyard of eroded presidential entitlements because of his recognition that the Congress was likely to challenge any presidential use of that unpopular perquisite.

===Reagan administration===
In November 1982, President Ronald Reagan signed a directive regarding congressional requests for information. Reagan wrote that if Congress seeks information potentially subject to executive privilege, executive branch officials should &quot;request the congressional body to hold its request in abeyance&quot; until the president decides whether to invoke it.

===George H. W. Bush administration===
Before becoming attorney general in 1991, Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr issued guidance in 1989 about responding to congressional requests for confidential executive branch information. He wrote: &quot;Only when the accommodation process fails to resolve a dispute, and a subpoena is issued does it become necessary for the president to consider asserting executive privilege&quot;.

===Clinton administration===
The Clinton administration invoked executive privilege on fourteen occasions.

In 1998, President Bill Clinton became the first president since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court when a federal judge ruled that Clinton aides could be called to testify in the Lewinsky scandal.

Later, Clinton exercised a form of negotiated executive privilege when he agreed to testify before the grand jury called by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr only after negotiating the terms under which he would appear. Declaring that &quot;absolutely no one is above the law&quot;, Starr said such a privilege &quot;must give way&quot; and evidence &quot;must be turned over&quot; to prosecutors if it is relevant to an investigation.

===George W. Bush administration===
The Bush administration invoked executive privilege on six occasions.

President George W. Bush first asserted executive privilege in December 2001 to deny disclosure of details regarding former attorney general Janet Reno, the scandal involving Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) misuse of organized crime informants James J. Bulger and Stephen Flemmi, and Justice Department deliberations about President Bill Clinton&#x27;s fundraising tactics.

Bush invoked executive privilege &quot;in substance&quot; in refusing to disclose the details of Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s meetings with energy executives, which the GAO did not appeal. In a separate Supreme Court decision in 2004, however, Justice Anthony Kennedy noted, &quot;Executive privilege is an extraordinary assertion of power &#x27;not to be lightly invoked.&#x27;&quot; &quot;United States v. Reynolds&quot;, 345 U.S. 1, 7 (1953).

Further, on June 28, 2007, Bush invoked executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas requesting documents from former presidential counsel Harriet Miers and former political director Sara Taylor, citing that:

The reason for these distinctions rests upon a bedrock presidential prerogative: for the president to perform his constitutional duties, it is imperative that he receive candid and unfettered advice and that free and open discussions and deliberations occur among his advisors and between those advisors and others within and outside the Executive Branch.
On July 9, 2007, Bush again invoked executive privilege to block a congressional subpoena requiring the testimonies of Taylor and Miers. Furthermore, White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding refused to comply with a deadline set by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explain its privilege claim, prove that the president personally invoked it, and provide logs of which documents were being withheld. On July 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee voted to cite Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten for contempt of Congress.

On July 13, less than a week after claiming executive privilege for Miers and Taylor, Fielding effectively claimed the privilege again, this time concerning documents related to the 2004 death of Army Ranger Pat Tillman. In a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Fielding claimed certain papers relating to discussion of the friendly fire shooting &quot;implicate Executive Branch confidentiality interests&quot; and would therefore not be turned over to the committee.

On August 1, 2007, Bush invoked the privilege for the fourth time in a little over a month, rejecting a subpoena for Karl Rove. The subpoena would have required Rove to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a probe over fired federal prosecutors. In a letter to Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy, Fielding claimed that &quot;Rove, as an immediate presidential advisor, is immune from compelled congressional testimony about matters that arose during his tenure and that relate to his official duties in that capacity.&quot;

Leahy claimed that President Bush was not involved in the decision to terminate the service of U.S. attorneys. Furthermore, he asserted that the president&#x27;s executive privilege claims to protect Bolten and Rove were illegal. The senator demanded that Bolten, Rove, Sara Taylor, and J. Scott Jennings comply &quot;immediately&quot; with their subpoenas. This development paved the way for a Senate panel vote on whether to advance the citations to the full Senate. &quot;It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover-up and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of that same effort&quot;, Leahy concluded.

, Rove still claimed executive privilege to avoid a congressional subpoena. Rove&#x27;s lawyer wrote that his client is &quot;constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony.&quot;

===Obama administration===
On June 20, 2012, President Barack Obama asserted executive privilege to withhold certain Department of Justice documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious controversy ahead of a United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform vote to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to produce the documents. Later the same day, the House Committee voted 23–17 along party lines to hold Holder in contempt of Congress over not releasing the documents.

====House investigation of the SEC====
Leaders of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) testified on February 4, 2009, before the United States House Committee on Financial Services subcommittee. The subject of the hearings was why the SEC had failed to act when Harry Markopolos, a private fraud investigator from Boston, alerted the SEC, detailing his persistent and unsuccessful efforts to get the SEC to investigate Bernard Madoff beginning in 1999. One official claimed executive privilege in declining to answer some questions.

===Trump administration===
While investigating claims of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed former FBI Director James Comey to testify. Comey was fired several weeks before being subpoenaed but had appeared before the committee once before in March while still serving as director. Less than a week before the scheduled hearing, it was reported that President Trump was considering invoking executive privilege to prevent Comey&#x27;s testimony. According to attorney Page Pate, it seemed unlikely that executive privilege would be applicable, as Trump had publicly spoken about the encounters in question multiple times.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokesperson, released a statement on June 5: &quot;The president&#x27;s power to assert executive privilege is very well-established. However, to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not assert executive privilege regarding James Comey&#x27;s scheduled testimony.&quot;

On May 8, 2019, Trump asserted executive privilege regarding the entire Mueller report at the attorney general&#x27;s request. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, this was Trump&#x27;s &quot;first use of the secrecy powers as president&quot;.

On June 12, 2019, Trump asserted executive privilege over documents related to adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. This was in response to a subpoena from the House of Representatives leading up to their impending vote over whether to hold Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress over the census question.

Trump invoked the privilege against the House Judiciary Committee: &quot;In re: Don McGahn&quot; then-U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled against the President, but an appellate court overruled Jackson.

Congress&#x27;s ability to subpoena the president&#x27;s tax returns was the subject of the federal court case &quot;Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP&quot;. However, the Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that this case raised questions of separation of powers rather than executive privilege. It said Congress needed a legislative reason to request the documents rather than conducting a criminal investigation, which is a power of the executive branch.

=== Biden administration ===
On May 16th, 2024, Biden asserted executive privilege over tapes of interviews from the special counsel report into his mishandling of classified documents. This came as Republicans in the House of Representatives were considering a contempt motion for Attorney General Merrick Garland, who had refused a congressional subpoena to turn over the tapes.

<doc id="315850" wikidata="Q6942239" url="?curid=315850" title="Music of Papua New Guinea">
<text>The music of Papua New Guinea has a long history.

==Traditional music==
After independence, the outside world knew little of the diverse peoples&#x27; traditional music genres. The first commercial release to see an international audience did not occur until 1991, when percussionist Mickey Hart&#x27;s &quot;Voices of the Rainforest&quot; was released.

After 1872, foreigners introduced Christian hymns, including Gregorian chanting. Peroveta anedia, ute and taibubu, all forms of Polynesian music, were also introduced in this period. The Gold Rush brought an influx of Australian miners who brought with them the mouth organ.

Traditional celebrations, which include song, dance, feasting and gift-giving, are called &quot;sing-sing&quot;. Vibrant and colorful costumes adorn the dancers, while a leader and a chorus sing a staggered approach to the same song, producing a fugue-like effect. 1993 saw television spreading across the country, and American popular music continued to affect Papuan music given the diffusion of radio since World War II. Since 1953, singsings have become competitive in nature, with contests occurring in Port Moresby, Mt. Hagen and Goroka. 1949 saw the first Papuan to achieve international fame, Blasius To Una, begin his career.

By the end of the 1970s, a local recording industry had appeared and artists such as Sanguma and later George Telek began mixing native and Western styles like rock and jazz.

===Sing-sing photos and traditional instruments===
Below are pictures from Papua New Guinea and Papua Indonesia.
==Pop music==
By the beginning of the 20th century, Christian hymns, work songs and gold rush songs were popular, some in native languages and some in English or German. By the 1920s, recorded music had become popular and radio broadcasting of western popular music appeared by the late 1930s. A few years later, Allied soldiers and sailors during World War II popularized the guitar and ukulele while stationed in the Philippines and Hawaii. String bands became very popular by the early 1950s, and soon dominated the pop landscape. In the late 1960s, rock bands like the Kopikats had appeared in cities, while string bands like the Paramana Strangers had become well known internationally. This was followed by the importation of bamboo bands, a style of music from the Solomon Islands using bamboo tubes played by hitting them with sandals. It first arrived in the area of Madang in the mid-1970s, and soon spread throughout the country.

==Reggae music==
Anslom Nakikus is a leading figure in Papua New Guinean reggae.

==Hip hop/rap==
O-Shen was one of the first to blend hip hop with reggae. The culture soon spread as many local underground talents surfaced, such as Naka Blood with their first hit &quot;Pom Pom City&quot; followed by &quot;Time is Now&quot;. Another group surfaced later by the name of 3KiiNgZ, taking Papua New Guinea by storm with the hits &quot;High Groove Theory&quot;, &quot;Kanaka Walk&quot;, and &quot;One Sound&quot; (featuring Sprigga Mek from the hip hop collective Naka Blood.) Sprigga Mek of Naka Blood went solo and released &quot;Sweet Mekeo&quot;, rapping in his local Mekeo dialect, and later released &quot;Pasin Kanak;&quot; this is now known as the unofficial national anthem of the Papua New Guinea Kanakas. Papua Gong Native with his Kanaka rhyming skills is one of the best-known local rappers rapping in Motu dialect. As the 21st century progressed, technology and influence from the outside world caused an exponential growth of recording artists and &#x27;Pacific-style&#x27; music. Artists such as Wild Pack (Tasik Yard), Daniel Bilip, Ragga Siai, Tarvin Toune, Saii Kay and Tonton Malele began to create their own mixture of modern and traditional music sung in Tok Pidgin, English and local tribal languages. This style of music by these popular artists now dominate music scene in PNG.

<doc id="315852" wikidata="Q700470" url="?curid=315852" title="Katsu Kaishū">
<text>Count &#x27; (born &#x27;; March 12, 1823—January 21, 1899, best known by his nickname ) was a Japanese statesman, naval engineer and military commander during the late Tokugawa shogunate and early Meiji period.

Kaishū was a nickname which he took from a piece of calligraphy (Kaishū Shooku ) by Sakuma Shōzan. He went through a series of given names throughout his life; his childhood name was . He was often called from his ceremonial title during the late Tokugawa shogunate and later changed his name to Yasuyoshi after the Meiji Restoration.

An advocate of modernization and westernization, Katsu was an influential figure during the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate (&quot;Bakumatsu&quot;) and subsequent Meiji Restoration. He eventually rose to occupy the position of commissioner &quot;(Gunkan-bugyō)&quot; in the Tokugawa navy and was a chief negotiator of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. As a major Tokugawa commander during the Boshin War, he is particularly known for his surrender of Edo to Imperial forces commanded by Saigō Takamori.

== Early life ==

Born Katsu Yoshikuni on March 12, 1823, in Edo to a low-ranking retainer of the Tokugawa shogunate. His father, Katsu Kokichi, the subject of the autobiography, &quot;Musui&#x27;s Story&quot;, was the ill-behaved head of a minor samurai family. As a youth whose given childhood name as Katsu Rintarō (Kaishu was a pseudonym), he studied Dutch and European military science, and was eventually appointed translator by the government when European powers attempted to open contact with Japan. Katsu developed the reputation as an expert in western military technology.

Under the advice of Dutch naval officers, Katsu served as head naval cadet at the Nagasaki Naval Academy between 1855 and 1859.

== Military service ==

In 1860, Katsu served as captain of the warship &quot;Kanrin-maru&quot; (with assistance from US naval officer Lt. John M. Brooke), to escort the first Japanese delegation to San Francisco, California, en route to Washington, DC, for the formal ratification of the Harris Treaty. The &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot;, built by the Dutch, was the first Japanese vessel to sail to the Western world. Kaishū remained in San Francisco for nearly two months, observing American society, culture and technology. Following his return to Japan, Katsu held a series of high-ranking posts in the Tokugawa navy, arguing before government councils in favor of a unified Japanese naval force led by professionally trained officers in disregard of promotion and assignment due to hereditary status. During his command as director of the Kobe Naval School, the institute would become a major source of activity for progressive thinking and reformists between 1863 and 1864.

In 1862, the then &quot;rōnin&quot; Sakamoto Ryōma decided to assassinate Katsu due to his support of both modernization and westernization. However, Katsu persuaded Ryōma of the necessity of a long-term plan to increase Japan&#x27;s military strength in the face of Western influence that led to the Convention of Kanagawa. Instead of killing Katsu, Ryōma started working as his assistant and protégé.

In 1866, Katsu was appointed negotiator between the &quot;bakufu&quot; forces and the anti-shogunal domain of Chōshū, and later served as chief negotiator for the Tokugawa bakufu, ensuring a relatively peaceful and orderly transition of power in the Meiji Restoration.

Although sympathetic to the anti-Tokugawa cause, Katsu remained loyal to the Tokugawa &quot;bakufu&quot; during the Boshin War. After the collapse of the Tokugawa forces in late 1867, Katsu negotiated the surrender of Edo castle to Saigō Takamori on 11 April 1868.

== Later years ==

Katsu relocated to Shizuoka after the new Imperial government took control of the shogun&#x27;s former capital, which was renamed Tokyo (&quot;Eastern Capital&quot;). He returned briefly to government service as Vice Minister of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1872, followed by first Minister of the Navy from 1873 until 1878. As Katsu Yasuyoshi, he was among the most prominent of the former Tokugawa retainers who found employment within the new Meiji government, and was between 1869 and 1885. Although his influence within the navy was minimal, as the Navy was largely dominated by a core of Satsuma officers, Katsu served in a senior advisory capacity on national policy. During the next two decades, Katsu served on the Privy Council and wrote extensively on naval issues.

He also made efforts to restore the honor of Tokugawa Yoshinobu and Saigō Takamori.

In 1887, he was elevated to the title of &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) in the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system. Katsu recorded his memoirs in the book &quot;Hikawa Seiwa&quot;.

== Death ==

In 1891, through a connection of Tsuda Sen, the father of Tsuda Ume, Katsu Yasuyoshi purchased a plot of land at , and built his retirement home there. Following his death in 1899, he was buried with his wife Tami near the site of their home, on the shores of Senzoku Pond, in what is today in Tokyo.

<doc id="315854" wikidata="Q48115" url="?curid=315854" title="Fulk IV, Count of Anjou">
<text>Fulk IV (; 1043 – 14 April 1109), better known as Fulk le Réchin (), was the count of Anjou from around 1068 until his death. He was noted to be &quot;a man with many reprehensible, even scandalous, habits&quot; by Orderic Vitalis, who particularly objected to his many women and his influential footwear, claiming he popularized the pigaches that eventually became the poulaine, the medieval long-toed shoe.

==Name==
Fulk was the usual name of the medieval counts of Anjou. It is the English form of the same Germanic masculine given name latinized as in contemporary accounts and written Foulques in modern French. They are all cognate with the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;people, kin&quot;).

, the epithet by which he is usually known, has no certain translation. Philologists have made numerous and varied suggestions, most but not all negative, including &quot;the Quarreler&quot;, &quot;the Rude&quot;, &quot;the Sullen&quot;, &quot;the Surly&quot;, and &quot;the Heroic&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
Fulk, born in 1043, was the younger son of Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais (sometimes known as Aubri), and Ermengarde of Anjou. Ermengarde was a daughter of Fulk the Black, an earlier count of Anjou, and the sister of Geoffrey Martel who inherited Anjou upon his father&#x27;s death.

===Count of Anjou===

Geoffrey Martel died without direct heirs, leaving Anjou to his nephew Geoffrey III, Fulk&#x27;s older brother. Some sources declare that his rule was incompetent and Fulk contested the succession, capturing Geoffrey in 1067. Under pressure from the church, he released Geoffrey but the two brothers soon fell to fighting again. The next year Geoffrey was again imprisoned by Fulk, this time for good. Fulk then ruled Anjou from 1068 until his death.

Substantial territory was lost to Angevin control due to the difficulties resulting from Geoffrey&#x27;s poor rule and the brothers&#x27; warring. Saintonge was lost, and Fulk had to give the Gâtinais to Philip I of France to placate the king upon his victory. Much of Fulk&#x27;s rule was devoted to regaining control over this territory and to a complex struggle with Normandy for influence in Maine and Brittany.

At some point before 1106, Fulk made a major gift to the Fontevraud Abbey.

===Wives===

There are conflicting accounts of Fulk&#x27;s life, including some who pointedly condemned him as &quot;a man with many reprehensible, even scandalous, habits&quot;. The clerics of his time particularly objected to his sexual promiscuity or deviance, which included marrying as many as five times, although the exact number of lawful wives, divorces, and repudiations is disputed.

Providing all the claimed formal marriages, he was said to have first wed Hildegarde of Beaugency in 1067. Ermengarde of Anjou, their daughter, later married Alan IV, duke of Brittany. Hildegarde was said to have died . Fulk was then said to have married Ermengarde of Bourbon, daughter of its lord Archambaud IV the Strong. Geoffrey IV Martel, their son, ruled jointly with Fulk for some time but died in 1106. Some of the sources state Fulk repudiated Ermengarde in 1075 on the basis of consanguinity. Around 1076, Fulk then wed Orengarde of Châtelaillon, the daughter of its lord Isambert or Isembard. He is said to have repudiated her in 1080, again on grounds of consanguinity. He was then said to have married a daughter of Walter I, Count of Brienne by 1080. He was said to have divorced this woman, whose name was not recorded in surviving accounts, in 1087.

Most scandalously, he was said to have married Bertrade, daughter of Simon I, lord of Montfort, in 1089. He extorted Robert Curthose for support of the marriage in exchange for his assistance with rebel Manceaux, which ultimately required Robert to restore the lands of Ralph the Asshead to Bertrade&#x27;s guardian William of Évreux. Bertrade bore him Fulk V, who later became count of Anjou and king of the Crusader realm of Jerusalem, before 1092, when she either abandoned Fulk in favor of King Philip I or was abducted by the king. (Accounts vary.) Apparently bigamously, she married the king and became queen of France on 15 May 1092. She was said to have fully reconciled Fulk with the king and the situation.

===Death===
Fulk died on 14 April 1109 leaving the restoration of the county of Anjou as it had been under Geoffrey III to his successors.

==Works==
A Latin history of Anjou and its rulerssurviving only in part and now known as &quot;A Partial History of Anjou&quot; ()are said to have been written by Fulk in 1096, although both the authorship and authenticity of the work are disputed. The first part of the work describing Fulk&#x27;s ancestry and some of his ancestor&#x27;s deeds is extant. A second part which would have dealt with Fulk&#x27;s own timesif it were ever writtenhas been lost. If he wrote it, it would have been one of the first works of history in medieval Europe written by a layman rather than a cleric. Some scholars propose that Fulk may have actually commissioned the work but used scribes to compose it.

==Legacy==

Amid his other denunciations of Fulk, the English historian Orderic Vitalis blamed him for the invention of pigaches, the pointy-toed &quot;scorpion-tail&quot; shoes, which became fashionable in France and England around this time and later developed into the unwieldy elongated poulaines. Supposedly Fulk began wearing narrow shoes with lengthened toes as a way of hiding his unsightly bunions from his 5th wife Bertrade before she abandoned him in favor of the king. (The fashion historian Ruth Wilcox offers that it may have been a simple adaptation of the Normans&#x27; sabatons, which they had extended to a point and turned down in the late 11th century to better hold their stirrups during battle.) In any case, the footwear was considered vain and obsceneif not demonicand were immensely unpopular with the church leadership of the period. St Anselm banned its use by English clerics at the 1102 Synod of Westminster, the papal legate Robert de Courson banned its use by the faculty of the University of Paris in August 1215, and the Fourth Lateran Council finally banned them for all Catholic clergy the same year.

<doc id="315856" wikidata="Q6942398" url="?curid=315856" title="Music of Solomon Islands">
<text>The music of [[Solomon Islands]] has received international attention since before the country became independent from the United Kingdom in 1978.

==Folk music==

Traditional Melanesian music in Solomon Islands includes both group and solo vocals, slit-drum and panpipe ensembles. Panpipe orchestras, which are well known on Malaita and Guadalcanal use up to ten performers with different instrument, each with unique tunings.

==Popular music==

In the 1920s bamboo music gained a following in several countries. Bamboo music was made by hitting open-ended bamboo tubes of varying sizes, originally with coconut husks. After American soldiers brought their sandals to the Solomon Islands, these replaced coconut husks by the early 1960s, just as the music began spreading to Papua New Guinea.

In the 1950s, Edwin Nanau Sitori composed the song &quot;Walkabout long Chinatown&quot;, which was to become popular throughout the Pacific, and has been referred to by the government as the unofficial &quot;national song&quot; of Solomon Islands.

Modern Solomon Islander popular music includes various kinds of rock and reggae as well as something known as island music, a guitar and ukulele ensemble format influenced by Polynesian and Christian music.

Traditional Melanesian choir singing features heavily in the soundtrack of the film The Thin Red Line, which is set against the backdrop of the Battle for Guadalcanal.

===Rorogwela===
In 1969/1970, ethnomusicologist Hugo Zemp recorded a number of local songs which were released on an LP in 1973, as a part of the &quot;UNESCO Musical Sources&quot; collection. One of the songs, a lullaby named &quot;Rorogwela&quot;, sung by Afunakwa, a Northern Malaita woman, was used as a vocal sample in a 1992 single &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; by the French electronica duo Deep Forest, becoming a worldwide hit but also causing some controversy over perceived &quot;pillaging&quot; of the world music heritage by Western musicians. This is because while the single went on to be successful, Afunakwa was not originally credited for singing the vocal sample. Deep Forest claimed they had asked permission of her to use her voice on their single, but it was later revealed she was never consulted before the song was made. 

Rorogwela&#x27;s melody was also used in Jan Garbarek&#x27;s &quot;Pygmy Lullaby&quot;. It was named as such because he thought the melody used in Deep Forest&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Lullaby&quot; was African. Later, when he learned the melody was actually from Solomon Islands, he agreed to no longer refer to it as &quot;Pygmy Lullaby&quot;. Also, he did not use the vocal track by Afunakwa, only the melody from the song.

The lyrics to Rorogwela translate to: 
&quot;Young brother, young brother, be quiet You are crying, but our father has left us He has gone to the place of the dead To protect the living, to protect the orphan child&quot;.

==Music institutions==

There is a Wantok Music Festival.

<text>Ranchi (; ) is the capital city and third largest city of the Indian state of Jharkhand after Jamshedpur and Dhanbad and also the administrative headquarter of Ranchi district.Ranchi was the centre of the Jharkhand movement, which called for a separate state for the tribal regions of South Bihar, northern Odisha, western West Bengal and the eastern area of what is present-day Chhattisgarh. The Jharkhand state was formed on 15 November 2000 by carving out the Bihar divisions of Chota Nagpur and Santhal Parganas. Ranchi is being developed as a Smart City because it was selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi&#x27;s flagship Smart Cities Mission.

Ranchi is also one of the oldest cities in Jharkhand. Jagannath Temple and Ratu Palace are some sights which witnessed the history of Ranchi. Ranchi is also nicknamed the &quot;City of Waterfalls&quot;.

Ranchi is rapidly growing its economy, and certain parks, special economic zones and industrial areas are being developed. Of late, new sectors and modern areas have been built for the city&#x27;s development.

==Etymology==
According to one popular tale, Thomas Wilkinson, a British captain, choose Archi (an Oraon tribal village) as headquarters. &quot;Archi&quot; means &quot;bamboo forest&quot; in local Nagpuri dialect. The British inadvertently named Archi as &quot;Ranchi&quot;. Captain Wilkinson renamed Kishunpur village as Rachi. Up to 1927, the place was known as Rachi.

In his book &quot;The Mundas and Their Country&quot;, anthropologist Sarat Chandra Roy writes that the name of the city is derived from the Mundari word &quot;aranchi,&quot; referring to a short stick used in driving cattle, whereas others have opined that &quot;aranchi&quot; refers to &quot;bi-weekly market&quot;.

According to another local story, Ranchi&#x27;s name comes from a local bird named &quot;rici&quot; that was found mostly in the Pahari Mandir premises. &quot;Rici&quot; is the name for the black kite &quot;(Milvus migrans&quot;) in the Mundari language, the modern-day landmark of Ranchi city, the Pahari Mandir, is also known as &quot;Rici Buru&quot; (रिचि बुरु) — the hill of the kites — and the city originated on the foothills of Rici Buru with the construction of &quot;Bada Talab&quot; by Commissioner Thomas Wilkinson at the same site.

==History==

The earliest evidence of use of several iron slag, pot sheds, iron tools found in Chota Nagpur region around 1400 BCE. Magadha Empire exercised indirect control over the territory, which lasted until the reign of the Ashoka. Armies of Samudra Gupta passed through the region on their expedition to the Deccan. In the 4th century CE, Nagvanshi king Raja Pratap Rai chose Chutia as his capital which is now a place in Ranchi. Few ruins of Chutia trace back to the 2nd century CE. With the expansion of the Mughal Empire, the sovereign status of the Nagvanshi dynasty was technically affected, but they continued to rule and administer independently. Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo made Satranji as capital of Barkagarh estate near Subarnarekha river. He built Jagannath Temple in 1691.
After the Battle of Buxar, Nagvanshi became a vassal of the East India Company. The British reduced Nagvanshi rulers to Jamindar in 1817 due to rebellion of Jagirdars under Nagvanshi against tax imposition by East India Company and directly ruled Chotanagpur. In 1833, Captain Wilkinson established headquarter of the South-West Frontier agency in Lohardaga but in 1843 they moved the headquarters to the village of Kishunpur, which he renamed into Ranchi after the hamlet located at the foot of the Hill. In 1855, Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo declared independence from British rule. British attacked Satranji but he defeated British forces. He ruled independently for two years. In the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo led soldiers of Ramgarh Battalion with Madhav Singh who was Jamadar of Ramgarh Battalion. Pandey Ganpat Rai, Tikait Umrao Singh and Sheikh Bhikhari also joined the rebellion. They attacked the British in Ranchi and compelled to flee them. But later they were defeated by East India company forces in Chatra and in Pithuriya with the help of the king of Pithuriya, Jagatpal Singh and hanged. British made Ranchi as municipality in 1869. Ranchi was first termed as a town in the census of 1872, when entire &quot;Ranchi thhana&quot; has 116,426 inhabitants. Nagvanshi shifted their capital to Ratu from Palkot in 1870. Udai Pratap Nath Shah Deo built Ratu Palace in Ratu in 1900. He donated large tracts of land to build the infrastructure of the city. Freedom fighter Birsa Munda died in the Ranchi jail on 9 June 1900. In 1912, Jyotirindranath Tagore, the eldest brother of Rabindranath Tagore, settled in Ranchi. Tagore Hill, where his house was located, has been named after him in remembrance. The last ruler of the Nagvanshi dynasty was Lal Chintamani Sharan Nath Shahdeo (1931–2014).

After independence, Ranchi saw significant increase in its population. Its population rate of growth was 3.5% in 1901 to 1941, which increased to 14% in 1951–1971. This was because of increased industrial and educational institutions being set up, as well as the arrival of post-partition refugees. Ranchi became an &#x27;administrative-cum-industrial&#x27; town in 1958 when Heavy Engineering Corporation was set up. The succeeding years saw Ranchi becoming the headquarters for the Steel Authority of India Ltd and Central Coalfields Ltd. The city remained the summer capital of Bihar till the creation of Jharkhand in November 2000, when Ranchi became the capital of the new state.

<doc id="315859" wikidata="Q272277" url="?curid=315859" title="Bathsheba">
<text>Bathsheba (; , ) was an Israelite queen consort. According to the Hebrew Bible, she was the wife of Uriah the Hittite and later of David, with whom she had all of her five children. Her status as the mother of Solomon, who succeeded David as monarch, made her the Gebirah () of the Kingdom of Israel. She is best known for her appearance in the Book of Samuel, which recounts how she was summoned by David&#x27;s royal messengers after he witnessed her bathing and lusted after her; David has Uriah killed and then marries Bathsheba, incurring the wrath of God, who strikes down the couple&#x27;s first child in infancy before plunging the House of David into chaos and anguish.

==Biblical account==

Bathsheba was the daughter of one of Eliam according to 2 Samuel 11:3 and of Ammiel in 1 Chronicles 3:5. An Eliam is mentioned in 2 Samuel 23:34 as the son of Ahithophel the Gilohite. Bathsheba was Uriah the Hittite&#x27;s wife.

David&#x27;s initial interactions with Bathsheba are described in 2 Samuel 11. While walking on the roof of his palace, David sees a beautiful woman bathing. He inquires about her, discovering her identity as Uriah&#x27;s wife. Still desiring her, David later has sex with Bathsheba, impregnating her. (David E. Garland and Diana R. Garland regard David&#x27;s actions as an example of rape in the Hebrew Bible.)

While the army was on campaign, David summoned Uriah in the hope that Uriah would have sex with Bathsheba, and in turn be convinced that the child she would eventually bear belonged to him. However, Uriah was unwilling to disregard rules applying to warriors on campaign, preferring to remain with the palace troops rather than sleep in his own bed.

After repeated efforts to convince Uriah to sleep with his wife failed, David gave an order to his general Joab that Uriah should be placed on the front lines in battle, where he would be in much greater danger. Additionally, David had Uriah himself carry this message back to the army. Uriah was ultimately killed during the siege of Rabbah, and Bathsheba mourned him. Then, David made her his wife, taking her into his house where she gave birth to his child.

David&#x27;s actions displeased God, who sent the prophet Nathan to reprove the king. In relating a parable describing a rich man who took away the lamb of his poor neighbor, he incited the king&#x27;s righteous anger, and Nathan then analogized the case directly to David&#x27;s actions regarding Bathsheba. Nathan declared that God would punish the house of David for Uriah&#x27;s murder and the taking of his wife. In turn, he would let someone close to David seize all David&#x27;s wives, and having him lie with them in broad daylight for everyone to see. David at once confessed his sins, expressing sincere repentance. Shortly after Bathsheba&#x27;s first child by David was born, God struck it with a severe illness. David pleaded with God to spare his child, fasting and spending the nights lying in sackcloth on the ground, but after seven days the child died. David accepted this as his punishment, and then went to the house of God to worship him.

David and Bathsheba would later have another son, Solomon. In David&#x27;s old age, Bathsheba secured Solomon&#x27;s succession to the throne instead of David&#x27;s older surviving sons by other wives, based on promises David made to her. Nathan&#x27;s prophecy came to pass years later when another of David&#x27;s sons, the much-loved Absalom, led an insurrection that plunged the kingdom into civil war. To manifest his claim as the new king, Absalom had sex in public with ten of his father&#x27;s concubines (2 Samuel 16), considered to be a direct, tenfold divine retribution for David&#x27;s taking of another man&#x27;s woman in secret.

==Judaism==
=== Relationship to Ahithophel ===
Several scholars see Bathsheba as the granddaughter of Ahitophel, as do passages in the Talmud. The argument is that she is called the daughter of Eliam in 2 Sam. 11:3, and 2 Sam 23:34 mentions an Eliam, the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, one of David&#x27;s &quot;thirty&quot;. The assumption is then that these two Eliams are the same person.

However, in 1 Chronicles the names are very different: Bathsheba is called Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel in 1 Chronicles 3:5. And in the list of David&#x27;s thirty in 1 Chronicles 11:36 we have Ahijah the Pelonite. Some have also questioned whether Ahithophel would have been old enough to have a granddaughter.

=== Rabbinic literature ===
Bathsheba was the granddaughter of Ahithophel, David&#x27;s famous counselor. The Aggadah states that Ahithophel was misled by his knowledge of astrology into believing himself destined to become king of Israel. He therefore induced Absalom to commit an unpardonable crime (), which sooner or later would have brought with it, according to Jewish law, the penalty of death; the motive for this advice being to remove Absalom, and thus to make a way for himself to the throne. His astrological information had been, however, misunderstood by him; for in reality it only predicted that his granddaughter, Bathsheba, the daughter of his son Eliam, would become queen.

Bath-sheba, the granddaughter of Ahithophel, David&#x27;s famous counselor was much younger than David.

The influence of the evil tempter of humanity brought about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba. The Midrash portrays the influence of Satan bringing about the sinful relation of David and Bathsheba as follows: Bath-sheba was making her bathing on the roof of her house behind a screen of wickerwork, when Satan came in the disguise of a bird; David, shooting at it, struck the screen, splitting it; thus Bathsheba was revealed in her beauty to David (ib. 107a). Bath-sheba was providentially destined from the Creation to become in due time the legitimate wife of David; but this relation was immaturely precipitated, and thus he became Bath-sheba&#x27;s partner in sin (ib.).

According to rabbinic tradition, when Bath-sheba saw the attempted crowning of Adonijah, she teamed up with the prophet Nathan to ensure Solomon&#x27;s role as David&#x27;s successor. At that juncture, she gained an audience with the king (who was consorting with Abishag in his old age and had been presumed impotent). During this meeting, the king engaged in 13 acts of intercourse with Bath-sheba before affirming his decision that her son Solomon should succeed him. The significance of that exact number of coituses and the meaning of their multi-coital encounter has been discussed in modern Biblical scholarship.

Bath-sheba is praised for her share in the successful effort to secure the succession to Solomon. Thus the verse in Eccl. iv. 9, &quot;Two are better than one,&quot; is applied to David and Bath-sheba; while &quot;the threefold cord&quot; which shall not be quickly broken (ib. verse 12) is applied to the activity of Nathan the prophet, who joined in the effort (Eccl. R. iv. 9).

== Christianity ==
In , &quot;the wife of Uriah&quot; is mentioned as one of the ancestors of Jesus.

In medieval typology, Bathsheba is recognized as the antetype foreshadowing the role of Ecclesia, the church personified, as David was the antetype for Jesus. As a queen and mother, she was also associated with the Blessed Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven. Bathsheba&#x27;s son, King Solomon, rises to greet her, bows down in veneration, and furnishes her a seat at his right hand. This demonstrates her exalted status and share in the royal kingdom. Bathsheba acts as intercessor for her subjects, delivering their petitions to the King: &quot;Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife&quot;.

Bathsheba (Barsabeh, Bathsabeh) is venerated in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church as a saint. Her feast day is 27 November (01 Tahsas).

== Islam ==
In Islam, David is considered to be a prophet, and some Islamic tradition views the Bible story as incompatible with the principle of infallibility (Ismah) of the prophets. A hadith quoted in Tafsir al-Kabir and Majma&#x27; al-Bayan expresses that Ali ibn Abi Talib said: &quot;Whoever says that David, has married Uriah&#x27;s wife as the legends are narrate, I will punish him twice: one for qazf (falsely accusing someone of adultery) and the other for desecrating the prophethood (defamation of prophet David)&quot;.

Another hadith narrated from Shia scholars states that Ali Al-Ridha, during the discussions with the scholars of other religions about prophets&#x27; infallibility, asked one of them, &quot;What do you say about David?&quot; he said &quot;David was praying, when a beautiful bird appeared in front of him, and David left his prayer and went after the bird. While David was walking on the roof of his palace, he saw Bathsheba having a bath... so David placed her husband in the front lines of the battlefield, in order to get killed, so that he could marry Bathsheba.&quot; Ali Al-Ridha got upset and said: &quot;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#x27;un, you assign sluggishness in prayer to the prophet of God, and then accuse him of unchastity, and then charge him with the murder of an innocent man!&quot;
He asked &quot;so what is the story of Uriah?&quot; and Ali Al-Ridha said &quot;At that time, women whose husbands passed away or got killed in the war would never get married again (and this was the source of many evils). David was the first person to break this tradition. So after Uriah was incidentally killed in the war, David married his wife, but people could hardly accept this anomalous marriage (and subsequently legends were made about this marriage.)

== Critical commentary ==
Bathsheba&#x27;s name appears in spelled &quot;Bath-shua&quot;, the form becomes merely a variant reading of &quot;Bath-sheba&quot;. The passages in which Bath-sheba is mentioned are , and —both of which are parts of the oldest stratum of the books of Samuel and Kings, part of that court history of David, written by someone who stood very near the events and who did not idealize David. The material contained in it is of higher historical value than that in the later strata of these books. Budde later connected it with the Jahwist document of the Hexateuch.

The only interpolations that concern the story of Bathsheba are some verses in the early part of the twelfth chapter, that heighten the moral tone of Nathan&#x27;s rebuke of David. According to Karl Budde the interpolated portion is 12: 7, 8, and 10–12; according to Friedrich Schwally and H. P. Smith, the whole of 12: 1–15a is an interpolation, and 12:. 15b should be joined directly to 11: 27. This does not directly affect the narrative concerning Bathsheba herself. 1 Chronicles omits all reference to the way in which Bathsheba became David&#x27;s wife, and gives only the names of her children in —Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon.

The father of Bathsheba was Eliam (&quot;Ammiel&quot; in ). As this was also the name of a son of Ahithophel, one of David&#x27;s heroes (), perhaps Bathsheba was a granddaughter of Ahithophel and that the latter&#x27;s desertion of David at the time of Absalom&#x27;s rebellion was in revenge for David&#x27;s conduct toward Bathsheba.

Kenneth E. Bailey interprets the passage from a different perspective: he says that David&#x27;s Jerusalem was tightly packed and Bathsheba&#x27;s house may have been as close as twenty feet away from David&#x27;s rooftop; people in ancient times were exceptionally modest about their bodies, so he suggests that Bathsheba displayed herself deliberately, so that instead of being an innocent victim, it was actually she who seduced David in order to rid herself of Uriah, and move in with King David.

David summoned Bathsheba for sex. Lawrence O. Richards states that the biblical text supports the innocence of Bathsheba, that David took the initiative to find out her identity and summon her, and that she was alone at the time and had no way to refuse the requests of a King. David J. Zucker writes that &quot;[s]he is a victim of &#x27;power rape. Andrew J. Schmutzer stated that &quot;David&#x27;s &#x27;taking&#x27; Bathsheba makes him responsible for her coming to him.&quot; Antony F. Campbell states &quot;The &#x27;violation of Bathsheba&#x27; may be the least unsatisfactory terminology, especially given the ambivalence of the text&#x27;s storytelling.&quot; According to Michael D. Coogan, the faulting of David is made clear in the text from the very beginning: &quot;It was springtime, the time when kings go forth to war... but David remained in Jerusalem&quot; (); if David had been away at war, the incident would not have taken place.

The Bathsheba incident leads to a shift in the book&#x27;s perspective; afterwards David &quot;is largely at the mercy of events rather than directing them&quot;. He is no longer able to control his family, and ends up being overthrown by Absalom. And in the story of David&#x27;s son Amnon&#x27;s rape of his sister Tamar, told so soon after the incident of Bathsheba, seems to draw a parallel between the sexual misconduct of father and son.
==Depiction in arts and culture==

===Art – Bathsheba in her bath===
Along with Eve, Bathsheba was almost the only female whose nude depiction could easily and regularly be justified in Christian art, and she is therefore an important figure in the development of the nude in medieval art. Though sometimes shown clothed at other points in her story, the most common depiction, in both medieval and later art, was &quot;Bathsheba at her Bath&quot;, the formal name for the subject in art showing Bathsheba bathing, watched by King David. This could be shown with various degrees of nudity, depending on the pose and the placing of clothes or towels. One of the most common placements in the 15th century, perhaps surprisingly, was in miniatures illustrating a book of hours, a personal prayer book, that overtook the psalter as the most popular devotional book for laypeople. This was especially the case in France.

In art the subject is one of the most commonly shown in the Power of Women &quot;topos&quot;. As an opportunity to feature a large female nude as the focus of a history painting, the subject was popular from the Renaissance onwards. Sometimes Bathsheba&#x27;s maids or the &quot;messengers&quot; sent by David are shown, and often a distant David watching from his roof. The messengers are sometimes confused with David himself, but most artists follow the Bible in keeping David at a distance in this episode.

<text>Sir Vivian Ernest Fuchs ( ; 11 February 1908 – 11 November 1999) was an English scientist-explorer and expedition organizer. He led the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition which reached the South Pole overland in 1958.

== Biography ==
Fuchs was the son of the German immigrant Ernst Fuchs from the Jena area and of his British wife Violet Watson. He was born in 1908 in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, and attended Brighton College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was educated as a geologist, and considered the profession a means of pursuing his interest in the outdoors. He was a member of the Sedgwick Club, a geological society, at Cambridge. His first expedition was to Greenland in 1929 with his tutor James Wordie. After graduation in 1930, he travelled with a Cambridge University expedition to study the geology of East African lakes with respect to climate fluctuation. Next, he joined anthropologist Louis Leakey on an expedition to Olduvai Gorge. In 1933, Fuchs married his cousin, Joyce Connell. A world traveller in her own right, Joyce accompanied Vivian on his expedition to Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana) in 1934. The findings from this expedition, in which two of their companions were lost, were summarised by Fuchs in his Cambridge University PhD, which has awarded 1937.

In February 1936, his daughter Hilary was born. Fuchs organised an expedition to investigate the Lake Rukwa basin in southern Tanzania in 1937. He returned in 1938 to find that his second daughter, Rosalind, had severe cerebral palsy. Rosalind died in 1945. His son, Peter, was born in 1940.

At the age of thirty, he enrolled in the Territorial Army, and was dispatched to the Gold Coast from 1942 to July 1943. He returned home and was posted to London at Second Army headquarters in a civil affairs position. The Second Army was transferred to Portsmouth for the D-Day landings, and Fuchs eventually reached Germany in time to see the release of prisoners from the Belsen concentration camp. He governed the Plön district in Schleswig-Holstein until October 1946, when he was discharged from military service with the rank of Major.

Fuchs was involved with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (now the British Antarctic Survey) beginning in 1947, when he applied for a geologist position. The institute&#x27;s goal was to promote Britain&#x27;s claims to Antarctica, and secondarily to support scientific research. In 1950 Fuchs was asked to develop the new London scientific bureau of the Survey, to plan research in the Antarctic and support research publication. After the trans-Antarctic expedition he become director of the Survey, a position he held until 1973.

From 1982 through 1984, Fuchs was president of the Royal Geographical Society. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1974.

==Family==

In 1933, he had married his cousin Joyce Connell, who had accompanied him on several expeditions. They had three children: Hilary (1936-2002) Rosalind (1938–1945), and Peter (born 1940). Joyce, Lady Fuchs, died on 27 April 1990 in Oxford, of a heart attack, aged 83.

The next year, in 1991, he married Eleanor Honnywill, his former personal assistant at the British Antarctic Survey, in Kensington and Chelsea, London. 

==Death==
Sir Vivian Fuchs died in Cambridge on 11 November 1999, aged 91.

==The Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition==

Fuchs is best known as the leader of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, a Commonwealth-sponsored expedition that completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica. Planning for the expedition began in 1953, and envisioned the use of Sno-Cat tractors to cross the continent in 100 days, starting at the Weddell Sea, ending at the Ross Sea, and crossing the South Pole.

Fuchs and his party arrived in Antarctica in January 1957 after camp had been set up. The party departed from Shackleton Base on 24 November 1957. During the trek, a variety of scientific data were collected from seismic soundings and gravimetric readings. Scientists established the thickness of ice at the pole, and the existence of a land mass beneath the ice. On 2 March 1958, Fuchs and company completed the 100-day trip by reaching Scott Base, having travelled 2,158 miles.

In 1958, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He co-wrote, with Sir Edmund Hillary, &quot;The Crossing of Antarctica&quot;. In 1959 he was awarded the Hans Egede Medal by the Royal Danish Geographical Society.

==Legacy==
* The Fuchs Medal was created in 1973 for &quot;outstanding devotion to the British Antarctic Survey&#x27;s interests, beyond the call of normal duty, by men or women who are or were members of the Survey, or closely connected with its work.&quot; It is awarded to one or two people per year.

<doc id="315861" wikidata="Q1196817" url="?curid=315861" title="Maeda Toshiie">
<text>was one of the leading generals of Oda Nobunaga following the Sengoku period of the 16th century extending to the Azuchi–Momoyama period. His preferred weapon was a yari and he was known as &quot;Yari no Mataza&quot; (槍の又左), Matazaemon (又左衛門) being his common name. He was a member of the so-called Echizen Sanninshu (Echizen Triumvir) along with Sassa Narimasa and Fuwa Mitsuharu. The highest rank from the court that he received is the Great Counselor &quot;Dainagon&quot; (大納言).

==Early life==

His father was Maeda Toshimasa and his wife was Maeda Matsu. His childhood name was &quot;Inuchiyo&quot; (犬千代).
Toshiie was born in the village of Arako (present-day Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya). He was the fourth of seven brothers, of Maeda Toshimasa, who held Arako Castle. Toshiie served Oda Nobunaga from childhood (first as a page) and his loyalty was rewarded by being allowed to be the head of the Maeda clan, very unusual for a fourth son with no apparent failures among his elder brothers. Just like Nobunaga, Toshiie was also a delinquent, usually dressed in the outlandish style of a kabukimono, they committed delinquent and deviated behaviors together. It is believed he also became a friend to Kinoshita Tokichiro (later Toyotomi Hideyoshi) in their youth. Just as Hideyoshi was known as &quot;Saru&quot;, 猴 or &quot;monkey,&quot; it is believed that Toshiie was called &quot;Inu&quot;, 犬 or &quot;dog&quot; by Nobunaga. Due to a long-standing belief that dogs and monkeys are never friendly to each other, Toshiie is often depicted as reserved and stern, in contrast to Hideyoshi&#x27;s talkative and easy-going nature.

==Military life==
Toshiie began his career as a member of the &quot;akahoro-shū&quot; (赤母衣衆), the unit under Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s personal command. He later became an infantry captain (&quot;ashigaru taishō&quot; 足軽大将) in the Oda army. Later, he become the leader of Oda&#x27;s ., a military group that wore a red Horo (cloak) on their backs.

During his military career, Toshiie made the acquaintance of many important figures, such as Hashiba Hideyoshi, Sassa Narimasa, Niwa Nagahide, Ikeda Tsuneoki, and others. Toshiie also was a lifelong rival of Tokugawa Ieyasu. After defeating the Asakura clan, Maeda fought under Shibata Katsuie in the Hokuriku area.

In 1554, he took part in the war for the first time in the Battle of Kiyosu Castle which was broken out between Nobunaga and Oda Nobutomo, of the Kiyosu Oda clan.

In 1556, he fought in the Battle of Ino against Oda Nobuyuki, younger brother of Nobunaga.

In 1558, he also took part in the Battle of Ukino which was a conflict with Oda Nobukata, a son of Oda Nobuyasu, of the Iwakura Oda clan. It is said that it was about the time of this battle that he began to be called by another name like &quot;Yari no Matazaemon&quot; or &quot;Yari no Mataza&quot;.

In 1560, he took part in the Battle of Okehazama against Imagawa Yoshimoto. Later he fought in the 1561 Battle of Moribe, the 1567 Siege of Inabayama, the 1570 Siege of Kanegasaki and Battle of Anegawa, the 1575 Battle of Nagashino, and the 1577 Battle of Tedorigawa.

In 1580, he was granted the fief of Fuchu, and a han (Kaga Domain) spanning the Noto and Kaga Provinces. Despite its small size, Kaga was a highly productive province which would eventually develop into the wealthiest &quot;han&quot; in Edo period Japan, with a net worth of 1 million &quot;koku&quot; (百万石); thus, it was nicknamed &quot;Kaga Hyaku-man-goku&quot; (加賀百万石).
Toshiie benefited from a core group of very capable senior vassals. Some, like Murai Nagayori and Okumura Nagatomi, were retainers of long standing with the Maeda.

In 1582, after Nobunaga&#x27;s assassination at Honnō-ji (本能寺) by Akechi Mitsuhide and Mitsuhide&#x27;s defeat by Hideyoshi, at the subsequent meeting in Kiyosu Castle where the future of the Oda clan was discussed, Toshiie supported Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s claim.

In 1583, he battled Hideyoshi under Katsuie&#x27;s command in the Battle of Shizugatake, but later during the battle, he switched sides to Hideyoshi.

In 1584, after Shibata&#x27;s defeat, Toshiie become leading general for Hideyoshi in Komaki Nagakute Campaign and was forced to fight another of his friends, Sassa Narimasa at the Battle of Suemori Castle. Narimasa was greatly outnumbered and felled by Toshiie.

In 1587, following the major Maeda victory, Toshiie sheltered his fellow daimyo Dom Justo Takayama after Justo was expelled from his position as representative of Christians by the shogun&#x27;s Bantenren order.

Later in 1590, Toshiie fought in the Odawara Campaign against Later Hōjō clan. Toshiie and Uesugi Kagekatsu led a detached force of 35,000 soldiers through Usui Pass. This army captured the Hōjō strongholds one-by-one: Matsuida Castle, Minowa Castle, Maebashi Castle, Matsuyama Castle and Hachigata Castle before finally taking Hachiōji Castle.

In 1591, he helped suppress the Kunohe rebellion in many locations along with Tokugawa Ieyasu and many generals from northern Japan.

==Later years==
In 1598, upon Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, Tokugawa Ieyasu proceeded with the &quot;expansion of power through marriage alliances,&quot; which Hideyoshi had explicitly forbidden. Ishida Mitsunari and other magistrates relied on Toshiie, and tensions between the Tokugawa and Maeda clans reached a critical point. Many influential daimyo, including Mōri Terumoto, Uesugi Kagekatsu, Ukita Hideie, Katō Kiyomasa, and Hosokawa Tadaoki, supported Toshiie. As a result, Ieyasu apologized to Toshiie, and for the time being, the situation was defused.

==Death==

Before dying in 1598, Hideyoshi named Toshiie to the council of Five Elders to support Toyotomi Hideyori until he was old enough to take control on his own. However, Toshiie himself was ailing, and could manage to support Hideyori for only a year before he died as well in 1599.

==After death==
Toshiie was succeeded by his son Toshinaga. Tokugawa Ieyasu saw this change of leadership as an opportunity and set a trap for Toshinaga. In 1599, Ieyasu announced that there was an assassination plot against him, and he identified Toshinaga as the mastermind. Toshinaga denied the allegations, but Ieyasu demanded, &quot;If you are innocent, hand over your mother as a hostage.&quot; In the Maeda clan, there were two factions: one advocating for fighting against the Tokugawa and another advocating for submission. Intense debates took place, but ultimately, Toshinaga&#x27;s mother, Matsu, persuaded everyone by saying, &quot;For a samurai family, preserving the household is paramount. Do not destroy the family just for my sake.&quot; Toshinaga then sent Matsu as a hostage to the Tokugawa clan. From this point on, the Maeda clan effectively came under the umbrella of the Tokugawa clan and fought on the Tokugawa side in the Battle of Sekigahara (1600).

<doc id="315862" wikidata="Q722013" url="?curid=315862" title="In the Flesh (Roger Waters tour)">
<text>In the Flesh was a series of worldwide concert tours by Roger Waters that spanned three individual tours over the course of three years (1999, 2000, and 2002). Returning from a 12-year-long hiatus from the road, In The Flesh was a showcase of his best known work from his days with Pink Floyd, with that material dominating shows. Songs were also performed from Waters&#x27; most recently released solo album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Amused to Death&quot;, being played live for the first time. The tour&#x27;s name is an allusion to the 1977 Pink Floyd tour for the &quot;Animals&quot; album, as well as the two songs so titled on the album &quot;The Wall&quot;.

The tour was a financial success in the United States. Because of Waters&#x27; long absence from the music scene, promoters and other industry figures were unsure of how well a Waters tour would do commercially, and were surprised when tickets began selling rapidly as soon as they were put on sale. In a number of cases, dates booked in smaller venues such as theatres were moved into larger ones such as outdoor amphitheatres or arenas. The 1999 portion of the tour ended up grossing $6.7 million from 21 shows, with a total of some 243,000 people attending.

Although Waters himself had no new music being released in conjunction with In the Flesh, the 2000 portion of the tour coincided with the release of &quot;Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81&quot;, commemorating Pink Floyd&#x27;s historic live performance of &quot;The Wall&quot;, and the tour and the release were cross-promoted. While the first two years of the tour took place only in North America, the third year stretched across the world. During the tour, Waters played two completely new songs, &quot;Flickering Flame&quot; or &quot;Each Small Candle&quot;, often as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts.

The 27 June 2000 performance at the Rose Garden Arena (Now Moda Center) in Portland, Oregon was later released as the primary source for the CD and DVD &quot;In the Flesh – Live&quot;. Several other shows were filmed as well for use in the CD/DVD, with announcements being made alerting audience members that they were being filmed.

== 1999 ==

The concert show consisted of his most famous tracks from the beginning of his Pink Floyd career. Along with the popular acclaim, the show received critical praise from various artists and magazines. Most of the tour band had worked with Waters before, although guitarist Doyle Bramhall II was new.

== 2002 ==

The success of Waters&#x27; two American tours encouraged him to make his 2002 tour a world tour. The set list for 2002 was similar to the previous tour with the addition of another new song, &quot;Flickering Flame&quot;, which was substituted periodically for &quot;Each Small Candle&quot; as the encore. The band also changed with the departure of Doyle Bramhall II, his wife and back up singer Sussanah Melvoin and Jon Carin. Brought in was Chester Kamen who replacing Bramhall on guitars and vocals as well as Carin&#x27;s vocals, Linda Lewis as back up singer (who later was replaced by Carol Kenyon due to personal issues), and Harry Waters (son of frontman Roger Waters) to replace Carin on keyboards and occasional guitar. By far the most historical moment of this or any of Waters in the Flesh tours came at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena as former Pink Floyd bandmate and drummer Nick Mason sat in and played both nights on &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;.

; Tour band:
* Roger Waters – guitar, bass guitar, vocals
* Andy Fairweather Low – guitar, bass guitar, vocals (has toured and recorded with George Harrison, The Who, Who member Pete Townshend, and Eric Clapton).

<doc id="315864" wikidata="Q221957" url="?curid=315864" title="Eiji Yoshikawa">
<text>was a Japanese historical novelist. Among his best-known novels are revisions of older classics. He was mainly influenced by classics such as &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, &quot;Tale of Genji&quot;, &quot;Water Margin&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, many of which he retold in his own style. As an example, Yoshikawa took up &quot;Taiko&quot;&#x27;s original manuscript in 15 volumes to retell it in a more accessible tone and reduce it to only two volumes. His other books also serve similar purposes and, although most of his novels are not original works, he created a huge amount of work and a renewed interest in the past. He was awarded the Cultural Order of Merit in 1960 (the highest award for a man of letters in Japan), the Order of the Sacred Treasure and the Mainichi Art Award just before his death from cancer in 1962. He is cited as one of the best historical novelists in Japan.

==Life==

He was born in Kanagawa Prefecture, in what is now a part of Yokohama. Because of his father&#x27;s failed business, he had to drop out of primary school to work. When he was 18, after a near-fatal accident working at the Yokohama docks, he moved to Tokyo and became an apprentice in a gold lacquer workshop. Around this time, he became interested in comic haiku. He joined a poetry society and started writing comic haiku under the pseudonym &quot;Kijiro&quot;.

In 1914, with &quot;The Tale of Enoshima&quot;, he won first prize in a novel-writing contest sponsored by the publisher Kodansha. He joined the newspaper &quot;Maiyu Shimbun&quot; in 1921, and in the following year he began publishing serializations, starting with &quot;Life of Shinran&quot;.

He married Yasu Akazawa in 1923, the year of the Great Kantō earthquake. His experiences in the earthquake strengthened his resolve to make writing his career. In the following years he published stories in various periodicals published by Kodansha, who recognized him as their number one author. He used 19 pen names before settling on Eiji Yoshikawa. He first used this pen name with the serialization of &quot;Sword Trouble, Woman Trouble&quot;. His name became a household word after &quot;Secret Record of Naruto&quot; was serialized in the &quot;Osaka Mainichi Shimbun&quot;; from then on his writing became much more popular.

In the early 1930s, his writing became introspective, reflecting growing troubles in his personal life. But in 1935, with the serialization of &quot;Musashi&quot;, about famed swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, his writing settled firmly into the genre of historical adventure fiction.

Upon the outbreak of war with China in 1937 the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; sent him into the field as a special correspondent. At this time he divorced Yasu Akazawa and married Fumiko Ikedo. In 1938, Yoshikawa joined the Pen butai (lit. &quot;Pen corps&quot;), a government organisation which consisted of authors who travelled the front during the Second Sino-Japanese War to write favourably of Japan&#x27;s war efforts in China. During the war he continued writing novels, and became more influenced by Chinese culture. Among the works of this period are &quot;Taiko&quot; and his re-telling of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

At the end of the war he stopped writing for a while and settled down to enjoy a quiet retirement in Yoshino (present-day Oumeshi) on the outskirts of Tokyo, but by 1947 he had started writing again. His post-war works include &quot;New Tale of the Heike&quot;, published in the &quot;Asahi Weekly&quot; (1950), and &quot;A Private Record of the Pacific War&quot; (1958).

On September 7, 1962, he died from cancer-related complications.

<doc id="315866" wikidata="Q720503" url="?curid=315866" title="The Asahi Shimbun">
<text>is a Japanese daily newspaper founded in 1879. It is one of the oldest newspapers in Japan and Asia, and is considered a newspaper of record for Japan.

The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; is one of the five largest newspapers in Japan along with the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot;. The newspaper&#x27;s circulation, which was 4.57 million for its morning edition and 1.33 million for its evening edition as of July 2021, was second behind that of the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;. By print circulation, it is the second largest newspaper in the world behind the &quot;Yomiuri&quot;, though its digital size trails that of many global newspapers including &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Its publisher, is a media conglomerate with its registered headquarters in Osaka. It is a privately held family business with ownership and control remaining with the founding Murayama and Ueno families. According to the Reuters Institute Digital Report 2018, public trust in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; is the lowest among Japan&#x27;s major dailies, though confidence is declining in all the major newspapers.

==History==
===Early years===

One of Japan&#x27;s oldest and largest national daily newspapers, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; began publication in Osaka on 25 January 1879 as a small-print, four-page illustrated paper that sold for one sen (a hundredth of a yen) a copy, and had a circulation of approximately 3,000 copies. The three founding officers of a staff of twenty were Kimura Noboru (company president), (owner), and Tsuda Tei (managing editor). The company&#x27;s first premises were at Minami-dōri, Edobori in Osaka. On 13 September of the same year, &quot;Asahi&quot; printed its first editorial.

In 1881, the &quot;Asahi&quot; adopted an all-news format, and enlisted Ueno Riichi as co-owner. From 1882, &quot;Asahi&quot; began to receive financial support from the Government and Mitsui, and hardened the management base. Then, under the leadership of Ueno, whose brother was one of the Mitsui managers, and Murayama, the &quot;Asahi&quot; began its steady ascent to national prominence. On 10 July 1888, the first issue of the &quot;Tokyo Asahi Shimbun&quot; was published from the Tokyo office at Motosukiyachō, Kyōbashi. The first issue was numbered No. 1,076 as it was a continuation of three small papers: &quot;Jiyū no Tomoshibi&quot;, &quot;Tomoshibi Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Mesamashi Shimbun.&quot;

On 1 April 1907, the renowned writer Natsume Sōseki, then 41, resigned his teaching positions at Tokyo Imperial University, now Tokyo University, to join the &quot;Tokyo Asahi Shimbun&quot;. This was soon after the publication of his novels &quot;Wagahai wa Neko de Aru&quot; (&quot;I Am a Cat&quot;) and &quot;Botchan&quot;, which made him the center of literary attention.

On 1 October 1908, &quot;Osaka Asahi Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Asahi Shimbun&quot; were merged into a single unified corporation, &quot;Asahi Shimbun Gōshi Kaisha&quot;, with a capitalization of approximately 600,000 yen.

In 1918, because of its critical stance towards Terauchi Masatake&#x27;s cabinet during the Rice Riots, government authorities suppressed an article in the &quot;Osaka Asahi&quot;, leading to a softening of its liberal views, and the resignation of many of its staff reporters in protest.

Indeed, the newspaper&#x27;s liberal position led to its vandalization during the February 26 Incident of 1936, as well as repeated attacks from ultranationalists throughout this period (and for that matter, throughout its history).

===Toward and during the war===
From the latter half of the 1930s, &quot;Asahi&quot; ardently supported Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe&#x27;s wartime government (called &quot;Konoe Shin Taisei&quot;, or Konoe&#x27;s New Political Order) and criticized capitalism harshly under Taketora Ogata, the Editor in Chief of &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;. Influential editorial writers of &quot;Asahi&quot; such as Shintarō Ryū, Hiroo Sassa, and Hotsumi Ozaki (an informant for the famous spy Richard Sorge) were the center members of the Shōwa Kenkyūkai, which was a political think tank for Konoe.

Ogata was one of the leading members of the &quot;Genyōsha&quot; which had been formed in 1881 by Tōyama Mitsuru. The &quot;Genyōsha&quot; was an ultranationalist group of organized crime figures and those with far right-wing political beliefs. Kōki Hirota, who was later hanged as a Class A war criminal, was also a leading member of the &quot;Genyōsha&quot; and one of Ogata&#x27;s best friends. Hirota was the chairman of Tōyama&#x27;s funeral committee, and Ogata was the vice-chairman.

Ryū, who had been a Marxist economist of the Ōhara Institute for Social Research before he entered &quot;Asahi&quot;, advocated centrally planned economies in his &quot;Nihon Keizai no Saihensei&quot; (Reorganization of Japanese Economies. 1939). And Sassa, a son of ultranationalistic politician Sassa Tomofusa, joined hands with far-right generals (they were called &quot;Kōdōha&quot; or Imperial Way Faction) and terrorists who had assassinated Junnosuke Inoue (ex–Minister of Finance), Baron Dan Takuma (chairman of the board of directors of the Mitsui zaibatsu) and Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi to support Konoe. In 1944, they attempted assassination of Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō (one of the leaders of &quot;Tōseiha&quot; or Control Group which conflicted with &quot;Kōdōha&quot; in the Japanese Army).

On 9 April 1937, the &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, a Mitsubishi aircraft sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun company and flown by Masaaki Iinuma, arrived in London, to the astonishment of the Western world. It was the first Japanese-built aircraft to fly to Europe.

On 1 September 1940, the &quot;Osaka Asahi Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Tokyo Asahi Shimbun&quot; unified their names into the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;.

On 1 January 1943, the publication of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; was stopped by the government after the newspaper published a critical essay contributed by Seigō Nakano, who was also one of the leading members of the &quot;Genyōsha&quot; and Ogata&#x27;s best friend.

On 27 December 1943, , a son-in-law of Murayama Ryōhei and the President of &quot;Asahi&quot;, removed Ogata from the Editor in Chief and relegated him to the Vice President to hold absolute power in &quot;Asahi&quot;.

On 22 July 1944, Ogata, Vice President of &quot;Asahi&quot;, became a Minister without Portfolio and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Kuniaki Koiso&#x27;s cabinet.

On 7 April 1945, Hiroshi Shimomura, former Vice President of &quot;Asahi&quot;, became the Minister without Portfolio and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Kantarō Suzuki&#x27;s cabinet.

On 17 August 1945, Ogata became the Minister without Portfolio and the Chief Cabinet Secretary and the President of Cabinet Intelligence Agency in Prince Higashikuni&#x27;s cabinet.

===After the war===

On 5 November 1945, as a way of assuming responsibility for compromising the newspaper&#x27;s principles during the war, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&#x27;s&quot; president and senior executives resigned en masse.

On 21 November 1946, the newspaper adopted the modern kana usage system (&quot;shin kanazukai&quot;).

On 30 November 1949, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; started to publish the serialized cartoon strip Sazae-san by Machiko Hasegawa. This was a landmark cartoon in Japan&#x27;s postwar era.

Between 1954 and 1971, &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; published a glossy, large-format annual in English entitled &quot;This is Japan&quot;.

Between April and May 1989, the paper reported that a coral reef near Okinawa was defaced by &quot;すさんだ心根の日本人&quot; (a man with a Japanese dissolute mind). It later turned to be a report in which the reporter himself defaced the coral reef. This incident was called :ja:朝日新聞珊瑚記事捏造事件 (the &quot;Asahi Shimbun coral article hoax incident&quot;)., and the president resigned to take responsibility for it.

On 26 June 2007, Yoichi Funabashi was named the third editor-in-chief of &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;.

Shōichi Ueno, the newspaper&#x27;s co-owner since 1997, died on 29 February 2016.

While Shin-ichi Hakojima was CEO, a partnership with the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; led to the publication of an English-language newspaper, the International Herald Tribune/Asahi Shimbun. It continued from April 2001 until February 2011. It replaced &quot;Asahi&#x27;s&quot; previous English-language daily, the Asahi Evening News. In 2010, this partnership was dissolved due to unprofitability and the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; now operates the &quot;Asia &amp; Japan Watch&quot; online portal for English readers. The &quot;Tribune&quot; (now known as &quot;The International New York Times&quot;) cooperates with &quot;Asahi&quot; on &quot;Aera English&quot;, a glossy magazine for English learners.

==Political stance==

The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; is considered left-leaning and has been called &quot;the intellectual flagship of Japan&#x27;s political left,&quot; with a long tradition of reporting on big political scandals more often than its conservative counterparts. The paper is considered a newspaper of record in Japan.

The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; is critical of right-wing Japanese nationalism and shows progressive tendencies in cultural and diplomatic issues, but has a neoliberal tendency economically. The latter contrasts with &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;&#x27;s relatively Keynesian economic viewpoint. However, in general evaluation, the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; seems to have a tone representing Japanese social-liberals (left-liberals).

The &quot;Asahi&quot; has called for upholding of Japan&#x27;s postwar Constitution and particularly Article 9, which bars the use of war to resolve disputes. The newspaper has also opposed changes in interpretation of the anti-war provision, including one made in 2014 that allowed the Japan Self-Defense Forces to come to the aid of an ally under attack—the so-called right of collective self-defense.

While the &quot;Asahi&quot; retracted articles based on the discredited testimony of Seiji Yoshida, its editorial position still recognizes the existence of the comfort women as Korean and other women from Japan&#x27;s conquered territories during World War II who were coerced into prostitution to serve the Japanese military.

==Controversies==
===Comfort women===
In August 2014, the newspaper retracted the discredited testimonies of Seiji Yoshida about the forcible recruitment of comfort women that were cited in several articles published by the &quot;Asahi&quot; and other major Japanese newspapers in the 1980s and 1990s. The paper drew ire from conservative media who, along with Abe&#x27;s government, criticized it for damaging Japan&#x27;s reputation abroad, some leveraging on this episode to imply that sexual slavery itself was a fabrication. The &quot;Asahi&quot; newspaper reaffirmed in its retracting article that &quot;the fact that women were coerced into being sexual partners for Japanese soldiers cannot be erased&quot; but also confirmed &quot;No official documents were found that directly showed forcible taking away by the military on the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan, where the people living there were made &#x27;subjects&#x27; of the Japanese Empire under Japanese colonial rule. Prostitution agents were prevalent due to the poverty and patriarchal family system. For that reason, even if the military was not directly involved, it is said it was possible to gather many women through such methods as work-related scams and human trafficking.&quot;

===Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster===
Following the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the &quot;Asahi&quot; and other newspapers faced growing public criticism for adhering too closely to the government narrative during their reporting of the disaster. In response, the &quot;Asahi&quot; strengthened its investigative reporting unit, called the &quot;Tokubetsu Hodobu,&quot; or Special Reports Section, to take a more independent approach to its coverage. The section won many awards, including the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association Award in 2012 and again in 2013.

In May 2014, the section published what it hoped would be its biggest scoop yet: a copy of the firsthand account of the disaster given by Masao Yoshida, who was the manager of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant when the triple meltdown occurred; the testimony, recorded by government investigators, had been kept hidden from public view. In the testimony, Yoshida said that 90% of the plant&#x27;s employees had left the plant at the height of the crisis despite him having given instructions for them to remain. He also testified that he believed his instructions had simply not reached the employees in the chaos of the disaster. However, controversy erupted over the &quot;Asahi&quot; story, and particularly the headline, which stated: “Workers Evacuated, Violating Plant Manager Orders.&quot; The newspaper came under intense criticism for slandering the workers by implying that they had fled the plant due to cowardice, when many in Japan had come to see Yoshida and plant workers as heroes who had prevented a worse disaster at the plant.

Japanese journalist Ryusho Kadota, who have previously interviewed Yoshida and plant workers, was one of the first to criticize the &quot;Asahi&quot; for mischaracterizing the evacuation. The &quot;Asahi&quot; at first defended its story, demanding that Kadota&#x27;s publisher apologize and issue a correction. However, in August, the Yomiuri Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, Kyodo News and NHK all acquired the same testimony, apparently from the government, and used it not to shed light on the disaster, but to attack the &quot;Asahi&quot;. In mid-September, facing intense criticism from other media and the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for its Fukushima coverage and also its retractions of the comfort women stories, the &quot;Asahi&quot; suddenly announced that the Yoshida story had been mistaken and retracted it. The president of the &quot;Asahi&quot;, Tadakazu Kimura, a supporter of the investigative section, resigned to take responsibility.

The reporters and editors responsible for the story were punished, and the Special Reports Section reduced in size, with many of its members reassigned elsewhere in the paper. Two of the top reporters later quit to found a non-profit journalism organization that is one of the first in Japan dedicated to investigative journalism, the Waseda Chronicle (name changed to Tokyo Investigative Newsroom Tansa in March 2021). The Asahi&#x27;s investigative section was told to avoid coverage of the Fukushima disaster, and has largely faded from view.

=== Coral article fabrication ===
In the evening edition of April 20, 1989, an article described how the world&#x27;s largest Azami coral in a sea area designated as a natural environment conservation area in Okinawa was damaged, with the initial &quot;KY&quot; scratched on the coral. Along with a color photograph of the scratched coral, the article lamented the decline in Japanese morals. Later, investigations by local divers who had doubts about the article proved that the &quot;Asahi&quot; photographer himself made the scratches to forge a newspaper article. Taking responsibility, the president (at that time) Toichiro Hitotsuyanagi was forced to resign. This was also known as the KY case.

=== Ritsu Ito interview report ===
On 27 September 1950, a solo interview with a Japanese Communist Party executive in hiding, Ritsu Ito, was posted. Later it was revealed that this was forged by the &quot;Asahi&quot; reporter in charge.

==Asahi Shimbun Asia Network==
The Asahi Shimbun Asia Network (AAN) is a think tank that aims to promote information exchange in Asia and provide opportunities for scholars, researchers and journalists to share their ideas on pressing themes in Asia. It was established in 1999. Their work includes annual international symposia and the publication of research reports. In 2003, Gong Ro Myung was chosen as the new president of AAN.

Symposia have included:
* 2008 Human Mobility and Regional Integration in Asia: The Current Situation of Higher Education and Labor Market and Policy Response

Reports include such titles as:
* 

==Asahi Prize==

Established in 1929, the Asahi Prize is a prize awarded by the newspaper, since 1992 by the Asahi Shimbun Foundation, for achievements in scholarship or the arts that has made a lasting contribution to Japanese culture or society.

==Reproductions of past issues==
Reproductions of past issues of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; are available in three major forms; as CD-ROMs, as microfilm, and as &quot;shukusatsuban&quot; (縮刷版, literally, &quot;reduced-sized print editions&quot;). &quot;Shukusatsuban&quot; is a technology popularized by &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; in the 1930s as a way to compress and archive newspapers by reducing the size of the print to fit multiple pages of a daily newspaper onto one page. &quot;Shukusatsuban&quot; are geared towards libraries and archives, and are usually organized and released by month. These resources are available at many leading research universities throughout the world (usually universities with reputable Japanese studies programs).

The &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; has a CD-ROM database consisting of an index of headlines and sub-headlines from the years 1945–1999. A much more expensive full-text searchable database is available only at the Harvard-Yenching Library at Harvard University, which notably includes advertisements in its index. Researchers using other university libraries would probably have to first use the CD-ROM index, and then look into the microfilm or &quot;shukusatsuban&quot; versions. Microfilm versions are available from 1888; &quot;shukusatsuban&quot; versions are available from 1931. Issues of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; printed since August 1984 are available through Lexis-Nexis Academic.

They manage to escape and swear to become . Their paths separate: Takezō decides to become a &quot;vagabond&quot; and wander the world challenging strong opponents, and Matahachi chooses to stay with women. Takezō returns to his hometown, the Miyamoto village, to tell Matahachi&#x27;s mother, Osugi Hon&#x27;iden, that her son is alive. However, Osugi reacts hostile because the village detests Takezō for his extremely violent and antisocial tendencies, and because the future of the Hon&#x27;iden gentry family is compromised now that their heir Matahachi is missing. Osugi pulls strings to accuse Takezō of being a criminal. Takezō fights his pursuers but is eventually caught by the monk Takuan Sōhō, who makes him reconsider his purpose in life.

==Production==

After finishing the basketball manga &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, Takehiko Inoue wanted to write something more realistic. He did not find differences between the basketball players and samurais since he claimed that none of them like losing. In retrospect, Inoue&#x27;s experience with changing demographics feels obligatory as he believes manga authors should challenge themselves. He called &quot;Vagabond&quot; as an experiment about complex writing. Inoue started &quot;Vagabond&quot; having wondered what the character was like when he read &quot;Musashi&quot;. Having come off of drawing a sports manga, he wanted to create a series about more basic concepts, such as &quot;life and death, the human condition, etc.&quot; Rather than portray Musashi&#x27;s later life in his &quot;enlightened state&quot;, which has been written about often, the author chose to depict the lesser known &quot;young man reaching that point of enlightenment when he comes from a place of being so like an animal&quot;. In 2009, he stated that he made his weekly deadline thanks to only having to draw the people, with his five assistants drawing the backgrounds. When drawing, Inoue avoids speed lines and instead keeps showing bodies based on his understanding how human bodies work.

Since not much is known about the real Musashi, Inoue wanted to give his own take which he considers more modern than other related works. He regards the artwork for &quot;Vagabond&quot; as a challenge in contrast to &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;. The author clarified that there are other activities besides fighting which are important for the protagonist. Should Inoue make Miyamoto constantly follow fights, the main character would die. Rather than tell a story, Inoue wants to shows the life of Miyamoto which he considers poetry. When Musashi comes face to face with Sekishūsai, Inoue tried to make the artwork appealing to the readers. In contrast to popular belief, Inoue&#x27;s Musashi does not follow bushido but instead a more unique path with a growth path that he finds realistic. He does not consider Musashi a samurai, but instead as a ronin. Other changes Inoue put when writing the manga was to make the supporting characters have different personalities from the novel. Inoue also expressed difficulties when drawing scene were the characters are wounded, most notably when Musashi battles the 70 Yoshioka which took a lot of energy to properly make. This scene was also a new idea he had when writing the manga as he felt that Musashi required a major challenge than in the novel.

In April 2009, Inoue told &quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot; that he suspected &quot;Vagabond&quot; would be ending &quot;within one or two years&quot;. Claiming that he did not know how it would end, but that it had entered its final stages. In January 2010, he confirmed it would be ending within the year. However, in September during a hiatus due to health concerns, Inoue announced that the ending had been delayed until 2011. Inoue posted an update on his website in December 2010, stating that &quot;Vagabond&quot; would not return until he regained &quot;enthusiasm&quot; for the series.

After eighteen-months, &quot;Vagabond&quot; returned to &quot;Morning&quot; as a monthly series in March 2012. The manga went on what was supposed to be a four-month hiatus in February 2014, with the reason stated being for Inoue to work on research. However, it was not until January 2015 that the series resumed. The series has been on indefinite hiatus since May 21, 2015, with its 327th chapter, &quot;The Man Named Tadaoki&quot;, being the latest one.

==Release==

Written and illustrated by Takehiko Inoue, &quot;Vagabond&quot; is based on Eiji Yoshikawa&#x27;s 1935 novel &quot;Musashi&quot;. It started serialization in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Morning&quot; on September 3, 1998. Kodansha has collected its chapters into individual volumes. The first volume was released on March 23, 1999. As of July 23, 2014, 37 volumes have been released.

In North America, Viz Media started publishing the manga in an American comic book format in December 2001; 16 issues were released until March 2003. Viz Media started releasing the manga in the regular graphic novel format in March 2002. Their release retains the color pages from the series&#x27; magazine run. The 37th and latest volume was released on April 21, 2015. Viz Media&#x27;s release was distributed in Australasia by Madman Entertainment.

The twelfth and latest one was released on April 21, 2015. In May 2024, Viz Media announced a &quot;Definitive Edition&quot;, releasing three volumes in a large-trim edition starting on January 21, 2025.

==Reception==
&quot;Vagabond&quot; has had over 82 million copies in circulation worldwide.

&quot;Vagabond&quot; won the Grand Prize for manga at the fourth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2000. The following is an excerpt from the speech congratulating Takehiko Inoue: &quot;From Toyotomi to Tokugawa. Musashi Miyamoto grew up amidst the turn of two great eras. Mr. Inoue has taken the powerful Musashi who was sometimes called a &#x27;beast&#x27; and drawn him as a vagabond. The artist brags about boldly challenging the national literary work of Eiji Yoshikawa, even so, the sense of speed that he creates is impressive. I send my applause to the artist for creating a new image of Musashi&quot;. The same year, the series won the 24th Kodansha Manga Award in the general category. &quot;Vagabond&quot; also received the Grand Prize of the sixth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002, and the North American version earned Inoue a nomination for the 2003 Eisner Award in the Best Writer/Artist category.

===Critical response===
In early releases of the manga, &quot;MangaLife&quot; found Musashi appealing for his quest of strength and Inoue&#x27;s detailed artwork despite its slow pacing. They find the early journey of Musashi impressive due to the emphasis on violence over his mental development and his connections with Matahachi. The eventual release of the sixth volume received more acclaim from the &quot;Manga Life&quot; for further developing Musashi&#x27;s bushido, his acceptance of his weak point and how Matahachi also kept appearing despite the two still not meeting. &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; was drawn out by the writing of Inoue when reading the first manga volume, praising its large amount of content and whether or not Musashi is still capable of being a true warrior when interacting with the monk Takuan. A similar comment was given by &quot;ComicBookBin&quot; with the reviewer claiming that his impression of &quot;Vagabond&quot; was so impressive that it reminded him of the comic book &quot;&quot;, praising the way Inoue portrays violence in a realistic fashion. Another aspect praised by the same website was the lack of large amount of dialogue needed to describe the characters.

Peter Fobian of Crunchyroll commented that &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;″s Hanamichi Sakuragi and Musashi are similar protagonists being young, egotistical prodigies, but that &quot;Musashi is a force of nature.&quot; He went to call Inoue&#x27;s take on Musashi unique when compared to the ones often depicted in fiction. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; praised the way Musashi addresses Bushido, the Code of the Samurai, which makes him honorable. The story arc where Musashi tries to take care of villagers as it retains the handling of Bushido but without relying on action and using other types of strength, was praised for retaining its pacing. &quot;Japan Times&quot; regarded Musashi&#x27;s growth from the ruthless warrior to a wise monk warrior to be well executed across the narrative.

While comparing the manga with the original novel, William Scott Wilson, the author of &quot;The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi,&quot; noted that the manga is darker and more mature; yet, although &quot;extraordinarily well drawn&quot;, it is &quot;no substitute for Yoshikawa Eiji&#x27;s work&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; regarded &quot;Vagabond&quot; as a &quot;samurai masterpiece&quot; for the contrast it makes with the novel by deepening the characterization of Musashi and alternate take on the rival Kojiro. Another aspect praised by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was how the protagonist makes philosophy about strength and his goal as the arc of the Yoshioka where the main character kills 70 men ends with him retaining severe wound on his foot that weakens him and makes him question what is being invincible. According to &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot;, &quot;Vagabond&quot; deserves the praise it gets both in narrative and artwork theme. &quot;One Piece&quot; manga artist Eiichiro Oda claimed he enjoyed the manga for touching deep themes and how it helped Inoue grow as an artist.

<text>Fusion was an American comic book series published from 1987–1989 by Eclipse Comics, whose creative team included the writer Steven Barnes, the artists Lela Dowling and Steve Gallacci, conceptual editor Lex Nakashima and many more.

The world of &quot;Fusion&quot; is centuries in our future, when a series of galactic wars have led to a spiraling arms race between &quot;tekkers and splicers&quot; — that is, between those who take a technological and technocratic route to improving humanity, and those who have abandoned humanity altogether through genetic engineering. The story involves the exploits of a group of space mercenaries in an era when humans who have not been enhanced either genetically or cybernetically, are becoming extremely rare.

From the first issue, the book included two back up series featuring &quot;Dr. Watchstop&quot;, and the &quot;Weasel Patrol&quot;, a comic stemming from doodles &quot;drawn&quot; of Tan.

&quot;Weasel Patrol&quot; had an animated pilot that was produced by Nickelodeon in 1991. It was never picked up as a series.

In 2014, the first five issues were reprinted in a collection titled &quot;Fusion: The Soulstar Commission&quot;.

==Regular characters==
The only recurring characters are the crew of the mercenary spaceship &quot;Tsunami&quot;.
* Indio Tremaine: Captain. Human. Born into the Clan of the Three Suns, of which she is the only survivor.
* Dow Cook: Synthetic human bio-engineered invulnerable to shock and trauma and with enhanced self-healing ability. Very insecure about himself.
* Tan: A &quot;musteliform&quot; bred from Terran otter stock. Canadian, an alumnus of Labatt&#x27;s Tech (a fictitious university named after the beer). An alcoholic mechanical and electronics wizard with a severe gambling problem. Never goes anywhere without his leather pilot cap and goggles.
* Beolvoch: A &quot;meehook&quot;. Something like a dinosaur with feathers. Has an extremely high metabolic rate and thus a voracious appetite for raw meat. Must eat regularly and copiously to stay active. Consequently, spends much time in a suspended animation state or complaining that he is hungry. Appears to be a genuine alien species rather than uplifted and genetically engineered &quot;earthform&quot;.
* Alshain: A &quot;felinoid&quot;; a temperamental and somewhat edgy pilot.
* Carz: A &quot;leoniform&quot; with only one working eye. He is generally a steadying influence, but when he loses it, beware!
* Herrick: A hawklike creature, of military caste. Dies very early in the series, in one of many moves which went against formula. Appears in &quot;how we got here&quot; sequences.
* Haven: A birdlike creature with well-developed nesting instincts. She is a doctor by training.
* Eddie: Modelled after some creature with very long ears and a prehensile tail. Likes to hang upside down. A cool dude in shades and khakis or Hawaiian shirts. Nothing rattles Eddie. Was a classmate of Tan at Labatt&#x27;s.

<text>Doctor Octopus (Dr. Otto Octavius), also known as Doc Ock for short, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #3 (July 1963). He is a highly intelligent, myopic, and stocky mad scientist who sports four strong and durable appendages resembling an octopus&#x27;s tentacles, which extend from his body and can be used for various purposes. After his mechanical harness became permanently fused to his body during a laboratory accident, he turned to a life of crime, and came into conflict with the superhero Spider-Man. He has endured as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three archenemies, alongside the Green Goblin and Venom. He is the founder and leader of the Sinister Six, the first supervillain team to oppose Spider-Man.

While usually portrayed as a supervillain, Doctor Octopus has also been occasionally depicted as a conflicted antihero and ally of Spider-Man. Following Spider-Man&#x27;s death in the 2012 storyline &quot;Dying Wish&quot;, which saw a dying Octavius swapping bodies with the hero and letting him die in his original body, Octavius was motivated to prove he could be a better Spider-Man. As such, he adopted the Superior Spider-Man alias, introduced in &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; #15.1 following a cameo in &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 3 #21 (both December 2012), as the fourth predominant main continuity Spider-Man. The Superior Spider-Man possesses all of the original Spider-Man&#x27;s abilities, memories, and equipment, along with additional gadgets created by Octavius, though he often struggles to live up to his predecessor&#x27;s legacy and seeks to turn his life around after being a villain for years.

In 2013, Marvel launched a 45-issue &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; comic book series focusing on the character&#x27;s redemption and superhero career. The original Spider-Man has since been resurrected after the death of Otto Octavius. Following &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, a copy of his consciousness became a villain, though a second volume of &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; launched in 2018 saw the duplicate taking on the mantle before returning to the Doctor Octopus mantle as an antihero, having his soul restored and memories of redemption erased by Mephisto, before returning to the role of Superior Spider-Man in 2023 in a new series by Dan Slott, and &quot;Spider-Man: Octopus Girl&quot; by Hideyuki Furuhashi and Betten Court.

Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: &quot;Created by Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Doc Ock, as he became known, has become one of the web-slinger&#x27;s most persistent, enduring, and dangerous foes.&quot; A fan favorite character and well-known figure in popular culture, Doctor Octopus has been featured in various media adaptations of Spider-Man over the years, including feature films, television series, and video games. In live-action, Alfred Molina portrayed the character in the films &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021). Kathryn Hahn voiced a female version of Doctor Octopus named Olivia Octavius in the animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; (2018).

In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Doctor Octopus 28th in the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time, and in 2014 rated him Spider-Man&#x27;s greatest enemy.

==Publication history==
Doctor Octopus first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #3 (July 1963), created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko. Lee recounted: &quot;Usually in creating a villain the first thing I would think of was a name, and then I would try to think of, &#x27;Well, now that I&#x27;ve got the name, who&#x27;s the character going to be and what will he do?&#x27; For some reason, I thought of an octopus. I thought, &#x27;I want to call somebody Octopus. And I want him to have a couple of extra arms just for fun&#x27;. But I had to figure out how to do that&quot;. The character reappeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #11-12, then again in #31-33.

Doctor Octopus is regarded as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most infamous enemies. He has been cited as the man Peter might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility. He is infamous for defeating Spider-Man the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter&#x27;s Aunt May. He is also the founder and core leader of the Sinister Six, and has referred himself as the &quot;Master Planner&quot;. (&quot;If This Be My Destiny...!&quot;) Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker&#x27;s body where he was the titular character from 2013 to 2014. In 2018, he returned as the Superior Spider-Man in a series written by Christos Gage and illustrated by Mike Hawthorne, and again in 2023 in a new series by Dan Slott, and &quot;Spider-Man: Octopus Girl&quot; by Hideyuki Furuhashi and Betten Court.

==Fictional character biography==

Born in Schenectady, Otto Octavius was the only child of Torbert Octavius, a construction worker, and Mary Lavinia Octavius, a homemaker. While Mary loved and supported Otto right from the beginning, Torbert was a violent alcoholic who regularly beat Otto and his mother. The young Octavius&#x27;s shyness and good work in school got him labeled as a &quot;teacher&#x27;s pet&quot; and targeted as a subject for bullying. Torbert hated having a bullied son and, believing that a man&#x27;s worth was determined by his dominant attitude and physical strength, roared at him to use violence in dealing with the bullies. Mary Octavius would always defend her son from Torbert&#x27;s tirades, saying he was a gifted thinker who would use his brain to solve problems, not his fists. Due to his mother&#x27;s insistence and her disgust towards men who worked in common manual labor, Octavius was determined not to become like his father and threw all his efforts into his education, regularly scoring top marks. Octavius&#x27; devotion to study paid off with him being awarded a university scholarship at M.I.T.. During Octavius&#x27;s freshman year of college, he was undecided in his studies until they were briefly interrupted by Torbert&#x27;s death in a construction accident. Otto attended the funeral for his mother&#x27;s sake, although he himself did not mourn his father&#x27;s death and later privately expressed his desire to have seen him suffer more. When Mary remarked that &quot;an early death is a manual laborer&#x27;s&quot; and she expected better from her son, this seemed to spur an obsession in Octavius about the hard sciences, and he declared his major to be physical science. His obsession, however, did not manifest immediately, and he was regarded by his school friends as a devoted student who was genuinely interested in the studies. He graduated near the top of his class, and was considered a catch to many scientific firms. Octavius was soon hired by an engineering firm.

Octavius became a brilliant and respected nuclear physicist, atomic research consultant, inventor and lecturer. He designed a set of highly advanced mechanical arms controlled via a brain–computer interface to assist him with his research into atomic physics. The tentacle-like arms were resistant to radiation and were capable of great strength and highly precise movement, attached to a harness that fit around his body. Later in his criminal career, he claimed the inspiration for the device came from the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot;, a pencil sketch made by Leonardo da Vinci, one of his idols.

Though his relationship with co-workers was typically hostile, he was social enough to give a demonstration of his harness to a small group. He showed how the metal tentacles allowed him to work safely with chemicals that would normally be too dangerous for a human being to touch or be in close vicinity to. One such person impressed by this was a scientist named Mary Alice Anders, and the two soon dated. In due time, Otto proposed marriage to Mary Alice. However, when Otto joyously announced his future marriage to his mother, her feelings were not reciprocated. Believing that no woman was good enough for her son, she made him feel guilty that she was going to be pushed aside for his bride-to-be. Shocked that he hurt his mother, and to please her, Otto broke off the engagement with Mary Alice. Later, when Otto discovered that his mother had hypocritically begun dating a librarian, he finally snapped and lashed out at her, causing her to have a fatal heart attack. With the death of his mother and Mary Alice Anders out of his life, Octavius&#x27; disposition towards nearly everyone became mean-spirited, and he had become more distracted from paying attention to detail and safety precautions in his work. His co-workers often called him &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; behind his back, a pun on his actual name inspired by the four-armed apparatus; he was aware of this insult, but he barely cared.

===Criminal career begins===
During an accidental radiation leak that ended in an explosion, the apparatus became fused to Octavius&#x27; body. It was later revealed that the radiation, or possibly his own latent mutation, had mutated his brain so that he could control the movement of the arms using his thoughts alone. The tentacles have since been surgically removed from his body, although Octavius retains the power to control them telepathically from great distances. The accident also seemingly damaged his brain (although it was later suggested that what was interpreted as brain damage was, in fact, his mind rewiring itself to accommodate four extra limbs), and the scientist turned to a life of crime, first taking the hospital hostage and calling himself &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; from the derogatory name that his co-workers had given him. Though Doctor Octopus himself is portly, in poor physical shape, and is near-sighted, with his harness attached he is physically more than a match for Spider-Man. The accident also made his eyes very sensitive to light, requiring him to wear glasses with shaded lenses.

In their first encounter, Doctor Octopus defeated Spider-Man, tossing him out of a window. Following this defeat, Spider-Man considered giving up his heroic career, but was inspired to continue by the Human Torch, and ultimately defeated Doctor Octopus.

Over the years, Doctor Octopus has become one of the most identifiable members of Spider-Man&#x27;s rogues gallery. Doctor Octopus formed the original Sinister Six to fight Spider-Man after taking Betty Brant and May Parker hostage. He has led subsequent Sinister Six groups and usually takes offense when someone else leads the team. Disguised as the Master Planner, he organized theft of atomic equipment. After he stole a formula that Spider-Man needed to cure his Aunt May, Spider-Man tracked Doctor Octopus&#x27; gang to their base. In the ensuing fight, Spider-Man became trapped underneath a collapsed building. Seemingly doomed, Spider-Man was ultimately able to draw upon the sheer force of his will to summon the strength to escape. It is later revealed he used a scuba tank to escape.

Doctor Octopus later attempts to steal the Defense Department&#x27;s Nullifier device, and sets a trap for Spider-Man. He became May Parker&#x27;s tenant, then got close enough to use the Nullifier on Spider-Man; although he had hoped that it would merely nullify Spider-Man&#x27;s web-shooters, the radiation in Spider-Man&#x27;s blood resulted in the Nullifier&#x27;s interaction with Spider-Man&#x27;s unique biology rendering him amnesiac, Doctor Octopus subsequently tricking Spider-Man into helping him before Spider-Man&#x27;s own better nature resulted in him turning against his &#x27;partner&#x27; despite his memory loss long enough for John Jameson to use the Nullifier to shut down his tentacles.

Doctor Octopus later exhibited the ability to activate his mechanical arms remotely, and used them to free himself from prison. His resulting battle with Spider-Man resulted in Captain George Stacy&#x27;s death. Doctor Octopus later waged a gang war with Hammerhead. He attempted to wed May Parker to acquire an island with an atomic plant which she had recently (and unknowingly) inherited. Doctor Octopus escaped death when the island was destroyed in a thermonuclear explosion and began a life as a homeless person. He next battled the &quot;ghost&quot; of Hammerhead, unwittingly returned him to his corporeal form using a particle accelerator and defeated him after forming a temporary alliance with Spider-Man.

Doctor Octopus later attempted to hijack an atomic submarine. He also attempted to poison New York City with printers&#x27; ink, and battled the Punisher and Spider-Man. He next battled the Owl and his gang. He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor in a laboratory before meltdown. He later displayed symptoms which Mister Fantastic diagnosed as multiple personality disorder.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Doctor Octopus was taken to the Beyonder&#x27;s Battleworld, where he fought a horde of heroes and plotted against Doctor Doom for the leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the X-Men, until Magneto came to the mutants&#x27; aid.

===Arachnophobia===
His crowning achievement of evil was the near-fatal beating of the Black Cat (Spider-Man&#x27;s then-partner) which led to Spider-Man beating Doctor Octopus to within an inch of his life. The trauma of the beating he received from Spider-Man left Otto Octavius afraid of Spider-Man and spiders in general for years, and he needed to be treated for his acute arachnophobia. Spider-Man was forced to let his nemesis beat him in combat so as to allow Octavius to break free of his fears and recruit him to save New York City from an exploding nuclear reactor; Octavius had been planning to detonate the reactor to kill Spider-Man indirectly, but after his out-of-control arms beat Spider-Man seemingly senseless, Spider-Man persuaded him to shut down the reactor to ensure that there were witnesses to his &#x27;great triumph&#x27;. Octavius decided to let Spider-Man live on the grounds that he would now have to cope with the same humiliation he had endured.

===&quot;Death&quot; and resurrection===
During the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, Doctor Octopus saved Spider-Man from certain death from a poison injected by the Vulture, although this was only because &quot;he&quot; desired to be the one to kill Spider-Man. During the healing process, he discovered Spider-Man&#x27;s identity and then allowed himself to be taken in by police, expecting to be saved by his accomplice/lover Stunner. However, Stunner was knocked out and Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Spider-Man clone Kaine.

Carolyn Trainer took over as &quot;Doctor Octopus&quot; until her teacher was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the Hand. Upon his resurrection, it was revealed that he now had no knowledge of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity, as the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by Carolyn Trainer and the memory of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity had not been recorded at the time of his death.

===Subsequent schemes===
In later years, Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed &quot;Spider-Woman&quot;. He has also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of arrogant young businessman and con artist Luke Carlyle, who pretended to employ Octavius at his company. Tiring of his life of crime and wishing to return to an engineering career, Octavius accepted the offer. This proved to be a ruse, and Carlyle subdued Doctor Octopus and stole his technology, using it to create his own version of Octavius&#x27; harness and tentacles. During a prolonged battle with Octavius and Spider-Man, Carlyle was defeated when Doctor Octopus ripped open his suit, allowing Spider-Man to fill Carlyle&#x27;s suit with webbing, although Doctor Octopus informed his enemy that he only did this to hurt Carlyle rather than to help Spider-Man.

Then, Doctor Octopus took the ambassador of the newly formed Free Palestinian State hostage, demanding that in exchange for the ambassador&#x27;s freedom, Spider-Man would meet him in Times Square and unmask himself in front of the world. When Spider-Man went to Times Square, he pulled off his mask to reveal another mask, angering Octavius enough to distract him from the release of the ambassador by agents of the Israeli Secret Service.

Doctor Octopus was taken to Ryker&#x27;s Island and was drugged and brainwashed to kill the Green Goblin. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the Brooklyn Bridge, and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memory of the event and missing two months of his life.

While hiding in a plant that was owned by the villain Fusion, Octavius was apparently forced to work for Fusion in helping him recover the &#x27;John Hancock&#x27; satellite, once used to find nuclear weapons but now capable of finding potentially radioactive superhumans such as the Hulk or Spider-Man. Although Fusion had apparently forced Octavius into submission, Octavius eventually revealed that he had merely been faking his submission so that Fusion could do all the hard work of finding the satellite for Octavius to sell off, subsequently beating Fusion half to death and attempting to sell the satellite himself before he was caught and defeated by Spider-Man.

===&quot;Civil War&quot;===
Octavius unsuccessfully tried to form and lead another version of the Sinister Six, because Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers managed to defeat the villainous group, although Doctor Octopus himself eluded authorities. In &quot;Sensational Spider-Man&quot; #28, Doctor Octopus is seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker in their second encounter (at the time, Octavius assumed he was an impostor). He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Doctor Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter&#x27;s students distract Octavius. He is then sent to Baron Zemo&#x27;s supervillain detention facility (as seen in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #104 and &quot;Iron Man&quot; (vol. 4) #14). Later, Spider-Man contacts Octavius to see if he can help with Aunt May&#x27;s condition.

===Dying===
When Doctor Octopus learns that he is dying due to the years of punishment his body took in his villainous career, facing superhuman foes when he is fundamentally human once getting past the tentacles, he becomes increasingly despondent and brazen in his final plans. Intending to leave a lasting legacy, he attempts to exert control over New York City by using his newly minted Octobots, but while he consciously intends to help, his subconscious drives him to turn the city&#x27;s resources against Spider-Man, and he also targets May Parker aggressively (deeming her guilty of being due to marry J. Jonah Jameson&#x27;s father J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.), subtly disrupting the planned marriage. Spider-Man is eventually able to take control of Octavius&#x27;s planned network, forcing Octavius to flee while vowing revenge.

In his desperate attempts to prolong his life, Octavius reforms the Sinister Six, wishing to acquire Menace&#x27;s unborn son, hoping to synthesize a pure strain of the Goblin Serum, only to be thwarted again by the efforts of Spider-Man and the guilty conscience of the Lizard, reigniting his bitterness towards his foe, but gaining a grudging acknowledgment of his abilities. Octavius and Spider-Man keep crossing their ways during the following months, with the Avengers fighting a new iteration of the Sinister Six, Doctor Octopus sending a remote Octobot in John Jameson&#x27;s shuttle, and Octavius contacting Iron Man to force him to find a cure for his degenerative condition. However, when Iron Man genuinely offers to have the brightest minds in the Marvel Universe find a viable cure, Octavius smugly refuses, in favor of witnessing Stark admit that he cannot do it and beg for mercy to disarm a device that Octavius had claimed was a bomb, basking in this &quot;proof&quot; of his (supposedly) superior intellect.

His attempts to prolong his life, however, do not hinder a more vast and sinister plan, in which he has the Sinister Six fighting the Avengers Academy for a piece of Hank Pym&#x27;s technology, the Future Foundation for a piece of Reed Richard&#x27;s technology, and the Intelligencia for the &quot;Zero Cannon&quot;, a powerful antigravity weapon, later revealing to have gained something useful from his early foray in John Jameson&#x27;s shuttle. All this careful preparation came to fruition during the &quot;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline, where the apparently mismatched pieces of technology stolen are used to build a satellite net, the &quot;Octavian Lens&quot;, able to alter the world&#x27;s climate by enhancing or smothering solar rays.

Doctor Octopus at first claims to have a benevolent intent, wishing to halt the greenhouse effect in exchange for gratitude and recognition, but he is soon exposed by Spider-Man (having enhanced himself with new technology created be Horizon Labs), the Black Widow and Silver Sable, who provoke him into revealing his real plan: immolate a great part of the entire population to prevent anyone from surviving his impending death, having the survivors remember him in perpetual fear and awe. Playing over his ego, Spider-Man manages to stall him, by reminding him that, even if anyone managed to survive a drastic heating of the entire Earth, the survivors would likely be brain-damaged, and as such unable to remember his actions. Spider-Man then roughly defeats him, in retaliation for Silver Sable&#x27;s death, openly mocking and berating his efforts by claiming that, because of the Octavian Lens&#x27; destruction and his declining health, he is now going to die alone, forgotten and without a legacy.

===&quot;Death&quot; and rebirth===
Even captivity and incarceration were unable to stop Octavius. Since Spider-Man was forced to access the Octobots&#x27; hive mind several times in previous months, he unwittingly gave Octavius a full, unrestricted access to his mind and as such he becomes able to program a lone Octobot to swap their mind pattern. Octavius is now in Peter Parker&#x27;s body and able to access his foe&#x27;s memories, but with none of his restraints content of living his civilian life and planning for his future, while his foe is now trapped in Octavius&#x27; failing body.

Peter is able to recruit the Scorpion, Hydro-Man and the Trapster with the task of keeping him alive and capturing &quot;Spider-Man&quot; in an attempt to reverse the mind swap. However, the Trapster&#x27;s portable life support can give Peter only 700 minutes to live. As such, Peter openly antagonizes &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. While Peter&#x27;s attempt to reclaim his body fails, he is able to imbue his nemesis with his very memories and values before apparently dying in Octavius&#x27; crippled body. Distraught, Octavius (in a sudden surge of empathy for his sworn nemesis) vows to steer himself away from villainy and accepts Peter&#x27;s dying wish of having a Spider-Man protect New York. Octavius claims that, since he now holds the physical might and the good values embodied by Spider-Man but also the boundless ambition and the scientific mindframe of Doctor Octopus, he will surpass the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, becoming a &quot;Superior Spider-Man&quot;.

===&quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot;===
Within Spider-Man&#x27;s body, Octavius starts his new career as a hero by redesigning his gear and putting his past as a villain behind himself. However, he soon finds himself the target of several villains, such as an Octavius-tech enhanced Stilt-Man, Boomerang, Overdrive, the Shocker, the Speed Demon, the new female Beetle, and the Living Brain, all of them trying to take over the place left by the seemingly-dead Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six. While they are still no match for the new, more ruthless Spider-Man, his violence and new mannerisms start to tip off several of his close friends and allies, such as the whole staff of Horizon Labs, Daredevil, Wolverine (explicitly forbidden to have Spider-Man&#x27;s mind telepathically scanned under the threat of legal action in court), Mary Jane Watson, and Carlie Cooper.

Despite his accomplishments, Octavius is revealed to be still haunted by Peter Parker&#x27;s lingering spirit, unable to reassert control over Spider-Man&#x27;s shared body, but actively hampering his efforts to stray from Peter&#x27;s values, and trying to reclaim his body. Despite Peter&#x27;s lingering influence, Octavius&#x27;s refusal of Peter&#x27;s values and perceived screw-ups prompts him to &quot;rectify&quot; some mistakes: &quot;Peter&quot; enrolls back to college, pursuing actively the PhD Peter denied himself in the past, and breaks the self-imposed &quot;no-kill rule&quot; by taking a proactive stance against evildoers and criminals, shooting the villain Massacre even after Massacre appeared to show signs of recovering from the brain damage that motivated his crimes, and violently assaulting the Jester and Screwball for a relatively minor insult. These actions prompted the Avengers to confront &quot;Spider-Man&quot; about his recent activities, recognizing that their friend would never act in such a manner. When their subsequent analysis confirms that he is still biologically Peter Parker, Octavius explains that he is merely dealing with stress over recent events.

Attempting a mind-wipe of all of Peter&#x27;s memories to destroy the living consciousness completely, Octavius manages to delete the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; memory. Realizing Peter would not surrender, Octavius directly engages his foe in Spider-Man&#x27;s mind. After beating Peter to a pulp by breaking his spirit with the knowledge Peter was willing let a girl named Amy come close to death when Octavius was performing surgery on her with a scanner that would have detected him, Octavius declares his final victory while calling Peter unworthy to be called Spider-Man and believes that he deleted all of Spider-Man&#x27;s memories. Returning to the real world, Octavius rejoices from his belief that he is free and has achieved victory over Spider-Man. But this erasure has also deprived him of Spider-Man&#x27;s memories, leaving it more difficult for him to pose as Spider-Man, with some of Peter&#x27;s friends (such as Carlie, Mary Jane, and J. Jonah Jameson, Sr.) questioning Spider-Man&#x27;s more brutal approach. While Octavius has developed more detailed resources than Peter possessed as Spider-Man, such as creating a small army of Spider-bots and Spiderling allies to assist him, as well as helping Cyclops trap the body-hopping mutant Malice in a specially-designed containment unit, he continues to resort to more questionable methods, such as killing Alistair Smythe, and blackmailing Jameson into giving him free rein in New York by threatening to expose the fact that Jameson asked him to do this. During a series of confrontations with his former allies in the Sinister Six, he also attempted to brainwash them into becoming his new &#x27;team&#x27;, resulting in him being forced to join forces with new hero Sun Girl when the Six snapped out of his control and tried to kill him.

Octavius&#x27;s focus on the larger scale also resulted in him missing the Green Goblin&#x27;s efforts to establish a new criminal empire, with the Green Goblin rescuing criminals who have escaped Spider-Man and recruiting them into his new gang, as Octavius simply focused on the leaders whereas Peter would have tried to capture the whole gang. His fixation in proving himself Spider-Man&#x27;s superior reached a particular climax when Spider-Man 2099 came to the past to deal with a temporal anomaly, with Octavius becoming so fixated with solving the problem and keeping his identity secret that he actually attacked the future Spider-Man rather than ask for his help, his actions resulting in the destruction of Horizon Labs because he could not solve the vibranium-related equations that Peter was able to resolve. Unknown to Octavius, Peter&#x27;s memories managed to survive the deletion. When Octavius attempts to access Spider-Man&#x27;s memories (because Octavius can only view memories that were looked at before the delete), Peter is shown lifting the &#x27;rocks&#x27; off himself from the mental battle.

When Carlie had found evidence that Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind is in Spider-Man&#x27;s body, she mourns Peter in Doctor Octopus&#x27; grave. The grave then collapses and Carlie falls in where she discovers that Doctor Octopus&#x27; body is not there. After Carlie has been captured by Menace, the Goblin King receives Carlie&#x27;s journal from Menace, where the Goblin King discovers evidence in it that states that Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind is in Spider-Man&#x27;s body.

Following him being possessed by the Venom symbiote, Octavius receives unexpected help from Peter Parker&#x27;s consciousness, though Octavius is still unaware that Peter survived their mental duel. Peter decides to maintain a low profile until Octavius does something that will cause him to spring into action. Peter finds that Octavius&#x27;s delete has left him with very few memories of his own, but after realizing those he still has are the ones that define him, vows not to give up, and that he will regain control of his body. The Superior Spider-Man finds himself facing the full force of the Goblin Underground since the possession of the Venom symbiote 31 days ago. When the Superior Spider-Man finally confronts the Goblin King, he mentions that he knows about Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind-swap with Spider-Man. The Goblin King then makes his next move by having missiles targeted at Spider-Island II.

Octavius survived the bombardment and escaped with the Living Brain. He then tries to find the Goblin King; however, before he can do so, Menace takes supporting character Anna Maria Marconi hostage. Meanwhile, the Goblin destroys all the buildings that mean something to Octavius, to punish him for robbing the Goblin of his dream: Killing Spider-Man. Octavius is lured to Empire State University, where he finds Don Lamaze. During the ensuing fight, Lamaze takes a blade meant for Octavius and dies in the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s arms. Heading to Alchemax, he is confronted by Spider-Man 2099, who takes control of the Spider-Slayers and demands answers. However, before he gets them, the Goblin King reactivates the Slayers to kill the Spiders, stating Norman Osborn now rules New York. Although he manages to escape, Octavius is forced to realize that he has failed in his goal to be a &#x27;Superior&#x27; Spider-Man when the restored Peter Parker takes over to save a child from a runaway train where Octavius hesitated, reflecting that he is aware of his fundamental inferiority, as he overcompensates while Peter holds himself back, but acts when he has to. Octavius then willingly deletes his own consciousness so that Peter can regain control of his body. As Octavius&#x27;s last memories fade, it is shown he had really fallen in love with Anna Maria, much to Peter&#x27;s surprise. Octavius tells Peter he is willing to give up his love to keep her safe - something only Peter can do as the &quot;true&quot; Superior Spider-Man - and urges the hero to save New York in his place.

===&quot;Spider-Verse&quot;===
In the run-up to &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, Octavius was sent to the year 2099 by accident while dealing with the temporal anomalies caused by Horizon&#x27;s time portal. Trapped in the future, he attempted to return home by creating a dimensional portal, but found himself travelling to various alternate universes – including one where Spider-Man joined the Fantastic Four and a variation of the House of M – where all the Spider-Men were dead. Realizing that something was hunting Spider-Men across other dimensions, Octavius began to gather some of the more ruthless Spider-Men into a team that could oppose whatever was killing them, including Spider-Man Noir, a multi-armed Spider-Man, Pavitr Prabhakar, and a Peter Parker working in black ops with Wolverine. As the crisis unfolds, Octavius takes command of a group of alternate Spider-Men, considering himself particularly qualified to lead them due to his unique nature and willingness to kill, but when his team is confronted by another group led by the Peter Parker of Earth-616 – who Octavius presumes is a past Peter as he cannot contemplate the possibility that he will fail- he is forced to concede to Peter&#x27;s leadership when Peter defeats him in a fight, Peter stating that killing Morlun and the Inheritors is not the answer, as they will just come back, and they need a new plan. Although he realizes that Peter comes from his future when Peter recognizes Anna Maria&#x27;s name, Otto is forced to acknowledge his own failures when he learns that another Earth where Ben Parker was the Spider-Totem was reduced to a nuclear wasteland due to the actions of his own local counterpart.

To stop the Inheritors from traveling around the multiverse, hunting all animal totems as fast as possible, Octavius identified the Master Weaver as the source of their abilities to traverse the multiverse, and killed him. However, Morlun feared the consequences of this action, resulting in Karn, the surviving defected Inheritor, taking the Weaver&#x27;s place (although it was noted that the Weaver was actually Karn&#x27;s future self, creating a complex temporal paradox). Having learned that he was &#x27;destined&#x27; to be replaced by Peter Parker, Octavius attempted to attack the multiversal web to &#x27;save&#x27; himself from his destiny, claiming that he was giving the spiders the &#x27;gift&#x27; of free will, but the Earth-616 spiders were able to defeat him as their surviving allies returned to their home dimensions. Before he departed, Octavius issued a time-delayed message to the Anna Maria program, intended to activate 100 days after he returned to his home time, but upon his return to his time, his memory of his time with the Spider-Army is erased, allowing history to unfold as it should.

===&quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Otto Octavius is still dead but a copy of his consciousness is shown to be inside the Living Brain where he is still in love with Anna Maria Marconi. Following the events of &quot;Spider-Verse&quot;, Otto Octavius had backed up his consciousness in one of his gauntlets (the Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s web-shooters) that slept for 100 days using the technology he acquired from 2099. The gauntlet housed a copy of Octavius&#x27;s consciousness up to the point of &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; (without the memories of learning about power and responsibility for his act of self-sacrifice in &quot;Goblin Nation&quot;, as this copy would remain asleep during this time). After transforming the gauntlet into a version of an Octobot, he backed himself up in the Living Brain while waiting for the next opportunity to take over Parker&#x27;s body again, planning to act at a time when Parker&#x27;s spider-sense would be taxed so that he would miss the relevant signals.

At the time when the Living Brain was at Parker Industries&#x27; London branch, Doctor Octopus&#x27; consciousness expresses anger over being forced to act like their lackey. After Sajani Jaffrey is fired by Peter Parker for conspiring against him, Doctor Octopus&#x27; consciousness smirks as Anna is made the head of Parker Industries&#x27; London branch.

====&quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;====
During the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Peter decides to have Parker Industries get familiar with New U Enterprises&#x27; &quot;New U&quot; system, which is a program where replacement organs are cloned for those suffering from serious injuries. Upon hearing about it from within the Living Brain, Doctor Octopus&#x27; consciousness expresses an interest in the procedure. When Peter Parker scanned the Living Brain to find out why it was acting unusually, Doctor Octopus&#x27; consciousness asked why it was erased. Realizing the truth, Peter Parker shut down the Living Brain, only for Doctor Octopus&#x27; consciousness to reactivate it and cause it to self-destruct while escaping in the Octobot. Arriving at New U Enterprises, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot plans to get his biological body back, convinced that the consciousness in Parker&#x27;s body was &quot;infected&quot; by its time in Spider-Man to believe that Peter was superior rather than himself. Upon heading to Potter&#x27;s Field, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot finds that Doctor Octopus&#x27; body was grave-robbed, alongside those of Alistair Alphonso Smythe and other villains. It traces the grave robbery to New U Technologies. Finding Doctor Octopus&#x27; body, the Doctor Octopus-possessed Octobot allowed it to be cloned and perfected. After eliminating the copy of Peter Parker&#x27;s consciousness, Doctor Octopus gains control of the clone body and emerges from the vat where he resembles his earlier appearance. The Jackal was present where he presents him with his tentacle pack. Now an ally of Jackal, Doctor Octopus receives the special New U Pills to prevent his body from suffering clone degeneration.

When Spider-Man later infiltrates New U Technologies after witnessing video footage of one of its subjects suffering from cellular degeneration, he evades the initial security force, including the Rhino and the female Electro. When he discovers what appears to be Gwen Stacy, he is distracted long enough to be caught off-guard by the reborn Octavius, once again in his own body with new tentacles. With Spider-Man trapped in his tentacles, Doctor Octopus tells him that he is not a clone or a hologram, but the real Otto Octavius.

After Silk escapes from New U Technologies, Doctor Octopus attacks Spectro who was unable to phase through the walls with the test subject. Doctor Octopus and Spectro fight until Electro arrives and knocks out Spectro. Doctor Octopus later experiments with Spectro and plans to put him into a cloned body.

While studying the clones of Kaine and Electro to perfect the Proto-Clone, Anna Maria was brought to Otto and she becomes uncomfortable when Doctor Octopus starts appealing towards his love interest. When Jackal enters the laboratory, Anna Maria reveals she knows how to stop the decaying process on the clones and Jackal offers her the &quot;Proto-Clone&quot; body in exchange for the formula. Octavius takes offense to Jackal&#x27;s comments on Maria&#x27;s dwarfism and attacks his boss. Then he pulls a switch which activates the Carrion Virus in all of the clones and causes them to start rapidly decaying.

Doctor Octopus fights Jackal to allow Peter and Anna Maria the time to transmit the frequency, Spider-Man correctly anticipating that Octavius would act to protect Anna regardless of their own history. The frequency has a huge effect on Doctor Octopus and Jackal. Upon checking New U Technologies&#x27; Haven following the broadcast, Spider-Man and Anna Maria find that Ben Reilly, Doctor Octopus, and Gwen Stacy have been seemingly reduced to dust. It was later revealed that Doctor Octopus rendered Ben Reilly unconscious and escaped by transmitting his mind into the Proto-Clone (a perfect clone of Peter Parker) before Ben Reilly could.

===Becoming the Superior Octopus===
With his new body, Otto Octavius returns to one of his old bases only to find it is being occupied by HYDRA. He defeats the HYDRA soldiers, but is then recruited into HYDRA by Arnim Zola. Zola grants him the leadership of some HYDRA soldiers to work for him in arranging the destruction of Parker Industries. With HYDRA&#x27;s help, he creates a new uniform for himself, becoming the Superior Octopus, intending to wait for Peter&#x27;s actions to trigger the collapse of Parker Industries so that he can retake his position and prove himself superior once again.

====&quot;Secret Empire&quot;====
During the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, the Superior Octopus appears as a leader of HYDRA&#x27;s Avengers. Outside of his work with HYDRA&#x27;s Avengers, the Superior Octopus approached Spider-Man, where he wants him to transfer ownership of Parker Industries back to him. When Peter Parker declined this offer, the Superior Octopus had the HYDRA agents in Parker Industries&#x27; London branch blow up the building. As Peter flees to the Shanghai branch of Parker Industries, Octavius attempts to implement various security protocols he had added to all Parker Industries tech that allows him to retake control of anything developed by the company, but Peter turns the tables on Octavius by ordering his employees to literally destroy the company to hurt HYDRA, thwarting Octavius&#x27; attempt to shut down his new high-tech suit with an EMP by reverting to his traditional costume and turning the EMP trick against Octavius so that his own tentacles attack him. Octavius is forced to flee the battle.

====&quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; and redemption====
During the &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot; story arc where the Red Goblin (Norman Osborn who has powered himself up with the Carnage symbiote) attacks Spider-Man and all his friends and family, the Superior Octopus and J. Jonah Jameson help defend Aunt May as the Superior Octopus still retains some of Peter&#x27;s memories and sense of responsibility. This concludes with Peter forgiving the Superior Octopus and giving him a &quot;clean slate&quot;. In the aftermath of Osborn&#x27;s defeat, the Superior Octopus reveals his new identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver, a person who has just started working at Horizon University. He was seen applying for a job under Max Modell as Anna Maria starts acting suspicious towards Dr. Elliot Tolliver.

====&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;====
During the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; storyline, the Superior Octopus is seen fighting the Night Shift. The Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange for the Night Shift becoming his agents, where he will compensate them from his own funds. They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items. The Superior Octopus leaves, advising them never to cross him or they will not live long enough to regret it. After a day at Horizon University and saving some people on the Bay Bridge, the Superior Octopus fights Arnim Zola, a bio-duplicate of Gorgon, and some HYDRA agents who seek to repossess his services to rebuild HYDRA. The Superior Octopus states that he is done with his end of the bargain and attacks them. When the Gorgon bio-duplicate turns the Superior Octopus to stone and shatters him, another Superior Octopus body emerges, where it destroys the Gorgon bio-duplicate and defeats Arnim Zola, while informing him to spread the word to HYDRA to never come for him again. The Superior Octopus&#x27; inner monologue states that he had perfected Miles Warren&#x27;s cloning technology where each clone had to be made from the deceased to maintain their memories as a way to conquer death. However, after Octavius forces Count Nefaria into retreating from Los Angeles, he is confronted in his cloning workshop by the Spider-Army. They reveal that his cloning process has been &#x27;hacked&#x27; by the Inheritors, who fed his computers hours-old data until they were ready to manifest, with these new Inheritors swiftly killing Spider-Man Noir and Spider-UK. Octavius then quotes &quot;What have I done ...&quot; After initiating his base&#x27;s self-destruct sequence to slow down the Inheritors, the Superior Octopus states that they still should have killed the Inheritors while they had the chance. Upon heading to his lab at Horizon High to change into his Superior Spider-Man appearance, he goes to recruit Kaine and states that they should leave Ben Reilly out of the fight, since Jennix is targeting the cloning technology from the now-defunct New U Technologies. As the Superior Spider-Man and Kaine enter the portal, they are unaware that Ben Reilly has followed them. The Superior Spider-Man heads to Earth-1048 to recruit that world&#x27;s Spider-Man, where he helps to defeat the Tarantula and learned about his counterpart. After Spider-Norman and Spiders-Man sundered Earth-616&#x27;s connection to the Web of Life and Destiny, Octavius seemingly betrayed Ben, giving him to the Inheritors in exchange for the other Spiders being left alone. When Spider-Man of Earth-1048, who had been secretly following both Octavius and Ben from behind, believed Octavius made the same mistake as his counterpart in betraying their own, Octavius revealed to him that he and Ben purposely planned this to trick the Inheritors into consuming the clone that will drove them insane, starting from when he was forced to relive the memories of Ben&#x27;s 29 deaths and resurrections. With the help from surviving Spider-Men who are trapped in Earth-616, including those who were trapped in another universe (including Kaine and 616&#x27;s Peter), Octavius manages to resurrect Ben in his 30th resurrection. With the Inheritors turned into babies to be raised by Spider-Ma&#x27;am (Aunt May) for their redemption; the same goes for Morlun, who is currently in 616&#x27;s high-security prison. Octavius resumes being the Superior Spider-Man.

===&quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 2)===
After the events of &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;, Octavius resumes his career as the Superior Spider-Man, protecting San Francisco with the hired assistance of the Night Shift. His identity as Dr. Elliot Tolliver is uncovered by Anna Maria, who confronts him with the rebuilt Living Brain. This is interrupted by the appearance of Terrax the Tamer. Using a machine to siphon a fraction of the Power Cosmic, Octavius defeats Terrax and passes out. While helping rebuild San Francisco and rescue survivors, the Octavius learns about humility and begins to connect with the people. Unbeknownst to him, Master Pandemonium emerges from the wreckage, planning to strike. When Master Pandemonium attacks, Octavius is forced to work with Doctor Strange to stop Pandemonium after he possesses his new associate Emma Hernandez.

During &quot;The War of the Realms&quot; storyline, the Superior Spider-Man worked to save the civilians from a Frost Giant invasion. Then he came up with the idea to work with the West Coast Avengers to make use of America Chavez&#x27;s powers. After rescuing them with his Octavian Lens, the Superior Spider-Man barely convinced them to help fight the Asgardian invasion at the source. They would have to go to New York City, since the Asgardian magic is interfering with America&#x27;s powers. In the midst of the battle between the Fantastic Four and Malekith the Accursed&#x27;s forces, the Superior Spider-Man worked with Mister Fantastic to enable America Chavez to duplicate the Bifrost Bridge&#x27;s energy. After the two of them failed to locate the strike team in Svartalfheim, the Superior Spider-Man and Mister Fantastic located the strike team in Jotunheim. Those in Jotunheim persuaded the Superior Spider-Man to focus on protecting Earth. The Superior Spider-Man returned to New York City to lead the West Coast Avengers in protecting the citizens. Once the War was over, Octavius confides that he feels guilty over being unable to save more people to Spider-Man, who comforts him. Unbeknownst to Octavius, he is being spied upon by one of the spiders that make up Spiders-Man on behalf of Spider-Osborn, who is planning revenge on him.

Following a date with Emma, they notice a news leak that claiming that the Superior Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus. Thus is denied by Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic, and Doctor Strange, who note his involvement in fighting the Frost Giants. The next day, Octavius admits to Max Modell that he is a clone. However, Modell reveals that he already knew. Upon analyzing the security footage of the leak, Octavius deduces that Spiders-Man was responsible. Spiders-Man then attacks them, but is subdued, and states that Spider-Osborn is safe on his world and that they will never reach him. Octavius, Anna Marie, and the Living Brain attempt to use the cosmic energies left over from the fight with Terrax to travel to Spider-Osborne&#x27;s world, but it goes wrong and causes an explosion. Spider-Osborn then appears, revealing that he was on Earth-616 all along. He beats Octavius, and reveals that he plans to kill everyone that he cares about as revenge for insulting him. Spider-Osborn starts by capturing James Martin, stating that he will release the boy only if Octavius kills three citizens on camera so that people will see him as a fraud.

Believing that he cannot win against Osborn, Octavius summons Mephisto and asks him to restore him to his original form for a day so that he can fight Spider-Osborn. Mephisto rejects this and offers to permanently restore Octavius to his original body, without any of &quot;flaws&quot;. Octavius accepts the deal, once again becoming Doctor Octopus. He attacks The Brothers Grimm as they collect their payment, demanding the location of Spider-Osborn. Octavius then defeats Spider-Osborn, throwing him back to his world. After briefly visiting Anna Maria and Emma at the hospital, he reveals that he has lost all memory of Spider-Man&#x27;s identity. He cuts ties with the Night Shift and leaves, leaving his Superior Spider-Man outfit in the garbage.

===Sinister War===
At the time when Doctor Octopus was finding clues to some of his missing memories and found a casket in a grave empty, Kindred had one of his centipedes go into Doctor Octopus&#x27; ear and had him go unconscious.

Kindred later told Doctor Octopus that he can help him with his memories, but he will need to gather five more people. At an unknown beach, Doctor Octopus helped Sandman with his loss of direction and promised to solve Sandman&#x27;s immortality problem. Upon building a special machine, Doctor Octopus resurrects Electro with his powers intact as Kindred comments on Electro&#x27;s abilities while stating that Doctor Octopus is getting closer to his true self. Doctor Octopus and Electro find Kraven the Hunter in the Savage Land hunting a dinosaur. When Electro shocks the dinosaur, Doctor Octopus recruits Kraven the Hunter into the Sinister Six by promising him to hunt down the Lizard.

In the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Doctor Octopus coerces Dr. Curt Connors into using the Isotope Particle Accelerator on himself which separates Lizard from Dr. Connors. While in the Osborn Graveyard, Doctor Octopus demands that Kindred gives him the answers he seeks. Kindred states to Doctor Octopus that he&#x27;ll get the answers soon as he adds Mysterio to the latest incarnation to the Sinister Six. In truth, Doctor Octopus secretly prepares a sonic transducer to destroy Kindred&#x27;s centipedes, at cost of knocking the rest of Spider-Man&#x27;s past foes, while saving them as well from hunting Spider-Man before the centipedes devoured their brains. To do so, Otto took a centipede from an undead Sin-Eater&#x27;s brain and used it on his transducer to both knock out and save Spider-Man&#x27;s past foes, barring Spider-Man and himself, while Boomerang was killed by Morlun when trying to save Spider-Man. Before splitting up, Otto urges Peter to make himself scarce and continue to fight Kindred safely before the surviving factions could recover, as most of them would still want to kill him.

===Beyond===
During the &quot;Beyond&quot; arc, Aunt May enlists Doctor Octopus to help bring Peter Parker out of a coma that he was placed into during a fight with the U-Foes. They did so by obtaining the samples of X-Ray and Vapor. When Aunt May returned to Peter&#x27;s hospital room, she found that the hospital received some technology from Doctor Octopus which came in handy in bringing Peter Parker out of a coma. Doctor Octopus later attacks the satellite location of Beyond Corporation&#x27;s shell corporation Infinite Solutions and finds that they were taking assets from the defunct Parker Industries, their use of Ben Reilly&#x27;s incarnation of Spider-Man, and the copying of Doctor Octopus&#x27; Spider-Man technology. This causes Doctor Octopus to declare vengeance on the Beyond Corporation.

===Devil&#x27;s Reign===
During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Doctor Octopus becomes part of Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s Thunderbolts unit. He accompanied the NYPD and Homeland Security to the Baxter Building to do a full investigation on the weapons of mass destruction that might be located there. Before Reed and Susan can retaliate, Doctor Octopus appears and places power dampener collars on them. He and Mayor Fisk persuaded the government that Reed worked for the work to look the other way and states that they now must come with them as a Thunderbolts unit shows up. Susan manages to get a Code X7 out to Human Torch, Ben Grimm, Franklin Richards, and Valeria Richards causing them to evacuate and get to Alicia Masters and the kids with her. Doctor Octopus later contacts Mayor Fisk about the inventions that he found in Reed Richards&#x27; lab. In the sub-basement of City Hall, Mayor Fisk meets with Doctor Octopus as they reference the time when Doctor Doom used Purple Man to control the world as it shows Purple Man&#x27;s body in a diamond-shaped container. Doctor Octopus&#x27; invention would help coerce the people of New York. Mayor Fisk states that he&#x27;ll handle the rest. With the special Neuro Blockers to keep him safe from the Purple Man&#x27;s influence, Doctor Octopus states that his part of the job is done. Doctor Octopus later makes use of Reed Richards&#x27; inter-dimensional gate where he brings over version of himself like Hulk from Earth-8816 who has two sets of arms growing from his back, a version of Ghost Rider from Earth-1666 with chain-tentacles coming out of his back, and a version of Wolverine from Earth-9712 with immensely sharp blades on the tentacles coming out of his back. Doctor Octopus then considers his plans &quot;Superior&quot;. Doctor Octopus is contacted by Mayor Fisk about the Purple Children as Doctor Octopus states that he is occupied at Reed Richards&#x27; laboratory, but can work on modifying Purple Man&#x27;s confinement when they have been found. After the call, Doctor Octopus tells Hulk of Earth-8816, Ghost Rider of Earth-1666, and Wolverine of Earth-9712 that they will see some action soon. Later that night, the superheroes arrive at City Hall where they are attacked by Doctor Octopus&#x27; Superior Four as Mayor Fisk watches from the window. Captain America discovers that Iron Man is actually Chameleon in disguise who Doctor Octopus was going to use to take part in the mayoral election on his behalf. Two weeks later, Doctor Octopus has released thousands of his Octobots to enforce Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s zero-tolerance policy, effectively wiping out all crime in the city. He and Wolverine of Earth-9712 visit Mayor Fisk as Doctor Octopus informs him that Butch Pharris has been arrested for his criminal activities.

Doctor Octopus and his Superior Four make plans to obtain the intellect of Doctor Octopus&#x27; counterparts throughout the Multiverse using a synthetic blood-parasite from Earth-5069 like they did on Spider-Ock of Earth-2902. When it comes to Earth-7214, the Superior Four attack its Atlantis and are confronted by Supreme Octopus. Doctor Octopus is then teleported to the Savage Land on Earth-8969 where he is ensnared by Supreme Octopus who considers himself superior to Doctor Octopus where he mentioned that he liquefied Shuma-Gorath, made Dormammu grovel, and burned Knull to ashes. The rest of the Superior Four are brought to Earth-8969 where neither of them want to follow Supreme Octopus. Despite what the Superior do, they are unable to beat Supreme Octopus. Hulk of Earth-8816, Ghost Rider of Earth-1666, and Wolverine of Earth-9712 turn against Doctor Octopus and help Supreme Octopus to rip off Doctor Octopus&#x27; tentacles. Doctor Octopus is then locked up with a skeleton and carnivorous plants in Supreme Octopus&#x27; mobile base called the Supreme Sanctorum. Upon being saved by a Man-Thing variant of himself from Earth-5069, Doctor Octopus defeated Supreme Octopus and took the rest of the Superior Four back to Earth-616 while planning to help them out. He did send Man-Thing of Earth-5067 to Earth-2902 where it shapeshifted into the new Spider-Ock.

Doctor Octopus was later abducted by an unknown figure who wanted to know more about Spider-Man. When Spider-Man locates Doctor Octopus and his fellow captive villains Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Sandman, and Vulture, he discovers that the culprit behind the abduction was Ultra Living Brain. After Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.

After his original tentacles had abandoned him, Doctor Octopus made a new set of tentacles and a new version of the Octobots called Ocktoids. He used these tentacles to fight Spider-Man and Norman Osborn&#x27;s Gold Goblin form.

While at the Bar With No Name, Doctor Octopus was working on another plan. After going into the bathroom, Doctor Octopus plans to find a way to become the Superior Spider-Man again.

In flashbacks to when Doctor Octopus first operated as Superior Spider-Man, he had worked on a miniature star project with help from his hired assistant Estrella Lopez and how her trying to take the project after Superior Spider-Man took credit for solving it led to her being turned into a fiery form that she dubbed Supernova. This caused Superior Spider-Man to trap her in the dodecahedron. In the present, Doctor Octopus came across his dodecahedron while rummaging through his old lair. As he was working on his latest weapon using energy from the dodecahedron, Supernova broke free from his imprisonment. As Doctor Octopus begged for mercy, Supernova stated to Doctor Octopus that he did not imprison her and goes off to find Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus wishes Spider-Man good luck when she finds him.

==Powers and abilities==
Otto Octavius is a genius in the field of atomic physics, and he holds a Ph. D. in nuclear science. A brilliant engineer and inventor, he is also a superb strategist and a charismatic leader. His genius in radiation is so exceptional that he was once called upon by Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four to offer his expertise when the Invisible Woman suffered from complications during her second pregnancy as a result of the cosmic radiation that had given the team their powers.

Due to exposure to atomic radiation, Doctor Octopus has acquired the mental ability of psychokinetic control over the four electrically powered, telescoping, prehensile, titanium-steel artificial tentacle &quot;arms&quot; (a degree of psychokinetic control over them that he can also exercise over vast distances even when they are not connected to him) that are attached to a stainless-steel harness encompassing his lower torso. Each of these four arms is capable of lifting several tons, provided that at least one arm is used to support his body. The reaction time and agility of his mechanical appendages are enhanced far beyond the range attainable for normal human musculature. The arms allow Octavius to move rapidly over any terrain and to scale vertical surfaces and ceilings. He has developed his concentration and control to the point that he can engage a single opponent, like Spider-Man, or multiple opponents with the arms while performing a completely separate, more delicate task, such as stirring coffee or constructing a machine. Due to his weight and age, his opponents are often lured into a false sense of security, only to find he is a formidable combatant. He has managed to force opponents as formidable as Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Captain America to take up a defensive position in a fight.

Doctor Octopus has also employed an armored body suit enabling him to breathe underwater and designed to withstand extreme water pressure.

Doctor Octopus has begun wearing a full-body armor suit due to an illness caused by the amount of punishment he has sustained over the years, made even worse by the fact that his ability to &quot;take&quot; damage is still at a human norm, even if he can deliver a superhuman level of punishment; he relies completely on his arms to prevent opponents with superhuman strength getting in close enough to damage his relatively unfit physical form even before his illness. To compensate, he has covered his entire body with his new suit, his normal arms are bound to his chest, and four additional tentacles have been added to his harness. He has also developed psychokinetic-telepathic control over an army of &quot;Octobots&quot; (small octopus-like drones).

===Harnesses===
Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original titanium harness, a more powerful adamantium harness, and a carbonadium harness with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The titanium and adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in &quot;The Lethal Foes of Spider-Man&quot; #1-4.

His current harness is made of a titanium-steel-niobium alloy mixture that is dense, but lightweight in composition. While wearing the harness, the arms are powerful enough to allow him to walk up sheer concrete walls and move about quickly. They are also used to grab items, both small and large, and as literal weapons in terms of being swung at objects and people like clubs. The pincers at the end of each tentacle can also be used to cut and tear into the flesh of his enemies. His sheer power using these appendages was great enough to beat Daredevil, a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death.

The adamantium harness was powerful enough to both restrain and pummel the Hulk into submission during a series written by Erik Larsen. The adamantium in his tentacles made besting Iron Man in combat possible, tearing the hero&#x27;s armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to allow his persistent problem with alcohol abuse to flare up. The harness is also capable of holding a small jetpack, allowing him to fly to places faster and able to evade Spider-Man more easily. Doctor Octopus is even capable of whirling his tentacles around to deflect small projectiles like bullets.

===Powers as the Superior Spider-Man===
With his mind having taken over Spider-Man&#x27;s body, Octavius gains possession of all of Spider-Man&#x27;s memories, powers, abilities, and equipment, although he loses access to Spider-Man&#x27;s memories after apparently removing his foe from their shared mind. As a way to reaffirm his perceived superior mind, he tinkered with the original Spider-Man costume, adding some carbonadium plating over his neck and skull, talons on his hands and feet, split-toed footwear fashioned as jika-tabi shoes, a slightly different, more imposing spider-motif on his back and enhanced lenses in his costume, with HUD and tracking abilities.

He also retains access to some of his former hideouts from when he was Doctor Octopus, coupling Horizon Tech-derived inventions with his own peculiar brand of technology.

===Octobots===
The Octobots are octopus-themed robots that are created by Doctor Octopus. There are two different kinds of Octobots:

* The first model of the Octobot seen are little metal balls with eight legs, which are mentally controlled by Doctor Octopus via a remote control. These Octobots can also be used to attack, to perform different tasks, and attach themselves to anyone so that Doctor Octopus can mentally control them.
* The second model of the Octobot seen is a giant metallic robot, which Doctor Octopus uses to attack huge constructions.

The Octobots have at least two known variations:

* The Spider-Slayers – These Spider-Slayers that appeared in &quot;Spider-Island&quot; are actually first generation Octobots that Spider-Man had laden with a special serum, which was used to cure the Spider-Virus that slowly turned everyone into Man-Spiders.

The cyclotron accident which &quot;creates&quot; Spider-Man also deforms the scientist into Doctor Octopus and results in his mad pursuit of proof of the Fifth Force. &quot;Doc Ock&quot; reconstructs his cyclotron and causes electromagnetic abnormalities, anti-gravity effects, and bi-location, which threatens to engulf New York City and the world. Additionally, Bob Hoskins and Arnold Schwarzenegger were considered for the role.
* Director Sam Raimi has stated that Doctor Octopus was intended to appear in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and team up with the Green Goblin, but was not included because Raimi thought it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t do the movie justice to have a third origin in there&quot;.
* Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus appears in the Sony film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004), portrayed by Alfred Molina.

Initially a well-meaning scientist working with Oscorp to develop a form of self-sustainable energy to benefit mankind, Octavius turns to villainy after his experiment goes wrong, resulting in Rosie&#x27;s death and Octavius losing control of his tentacle harness&#x27; artificial intelligence, which begins to influence his mind and actions and brings him into conflict with Spider-Man.

* A female incarnation of Doctor Octopus named Dr. Olivia &quot;Liv&quot; Octavius appears in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, voiced by Kathryn Hahn. She is the head scientist of Alchemax and the Kingpin&#x27;s right-hand woman who sports a large beehive hairstyle, glasses with octagonal lenses, and pneumatic tentacles tipped with claws. Under the Kingpin&#x27;s orders, she builds a super-collider to access parallel universes. In spite of the initial tests nearly destroying New York City and bringing several alternate reality versions of Spider-Man to their universe, the Kingpin orders Liv to continue working on the collider. She later encounters Miles Morales and an alternate reality Peter Parker while they are infiltrating Alchemax, but fails to catch them. After confronting the assembled Spider-People at May Parker&#x27;s house alongside the Kingpin and his other henchmen and failing to stop them a second time, Liv tries to stop the heroes at the collider, only to be hit by a truck when the machine goes haywire and melds her universe with aspects of others.

<text>Uriah the Hittite ( &quot;ʾŪrīyyā haḤīttī&quot;) is a minor figure in the Hebrew Bible, mentioned in the Books of Samuel, an elite soldier in the army of David, king of Israel and Judah, and the husband of Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam. While Uriah was serving in David&#x27;s army abroad, David, from the roof of his palace, looked down on his city and spied upon Bathsheba bathing in the privacy of her courtyard. Moved by lust at the sight of her, David called for Bathsheba to be brought to him and slept with her, impregnating her. In an effort to hide his misdeeds, David called Uriah home from war, hoping that he and Bathsheba would sleep with each other and that he would be able to pass the child off as belonging to Uriah. However, Uriah, being a disciplined soldier, refused to visit his wife. So David murdered him by proxy by ordering all of Uriah&#x27;s comrades to abandon him in the midst of battle, so that he ended up getting killed by an opposing army. Following Uriah&#x27;s death, David took Bathsheba as his eighth wife.

==Biblical account==

=== Name ===
The name Uriah is of uncertain origin. Early on it was suggested to be of Hebrew origin, a theophoric name referencing Yahweh, meaning &quot;the (Yahweh) is my light&quot;. Later several possible sources from Anatolian languages have been suggested until in 2018 it was identified as a probable loan from Luwian uriia- &#x27;commander&#x27;.

Based on the Biblical account, Uriah was likely of the ethnic Hittite minority living in Israel that had lived in and around the region, &quot;the Land of Canaan&quot;, since before the time of Abraham. The Hebrews upon their entry into Canaan had been commanded (Deuteronomy 20:16–17) to kill &quot;anything that breathes ... in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance,&quot; with the explanation that &quot;otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:18). Even so, some of the earlier inhabitants were spared, in some cases for cooperating with the Hebrews (Joshua 2:12–14, 6:23, Judges 1:24–25) in other cases from failure to carry out the extermination order (Joshua 15:63, 16:10, Judges 1:19, 21, 27–36).

The era of David&#x27;s rule was generations after this time and by his day, many residents of non-Israelite descent who followed the Israelite religion had come to be accepted as Israelites. Uriah might have been among these, as his name in Hebrew may have meant &quot;Yahweh is my light&quot;. In addition, his status as an officer in the army and as one of David&#x27;s &quot;mighty men&quot; would indicate acceptance within the ethnic community.

The Talmud states two opinions as to who Uriah was: 1) He was a convert to Judaism. 2) He lived among Hittites and so is known as a Hittite despite his being born Jewish. (Kiddushin 76b) Either way, he was not actually part of the Hittite nation because he would have been forbidden to marry Bathsheba had he been a Gentile.

===David&#x27;s Mighty Men===

David&#x27;s mighty men were a group of his best 37 fighters (later expanded to around 80). Although the lists of his mighty men (2 Samuel 23:8–39 &amp; 1 Chronicles 11:10–47) are given after David has become king, many of them may have been the loyal followers who stayed with him when he was fleeing King Saul. At the very least, they fought side by side with him. Uriah&#x27;s closeness to David is illustrated by how closely he lived to the palace, and his position as one of the mighty men at the front battle lines allowed David to formulate and carry out his plot.

===David and Bathsheba===
According to Second Samuel, King David was tempted upon seeing Bathsheba bathe in her courtyard from the roof of his palace. He had her brought to his chambers and had sex with her, resulting in a pregnancy. Informed that her husband was Uriah, David summoned Uriah from battle to meet him, suggesting that he go home and &quot;wash his feet,&quot; meaning to spend time at home and attend to his wife.

Uriah refused, claiming a code of honor with his fellow warriors while they were in battle. It was common for warriors in preparation for battle to abstain from sex, as a practice of discipline. After Uriah repeatedly refused to see his wife Bathsheba, David sent him to his commanding officer Joab with a letter that ordered Joab to put Uriah on the front lines of the battle and have the other soldiers move away from him so that he would be killed by enemy soldiers.

Despite Uriah&#x27;s status as one of David&#x27;s mighty men, British rabbi Jonathan Magonet observes that Uriah refers to Joab, not David, as &quot;my lord (or commander)&quot; (2 Samuel 11:11). Joab is, Magonet notes, a kingmaker who dispatches ruthlessly his own military rivals, Abner and Amasa. He is sufficiently powerful that David, on his deathbed, advises Solomon to arrange his death (1 Kings 2:5–6). This statement prompts Magonet to speculate that David saw some deeper political threat from Joab through his entanglement with Uriah&#x27;s wife.

===Nathan&#x27;s prophecy===
The prophet Nathan soon after confronted David about this murder, by first telling him a parable of a rich man and a poor man: The rich man had many sheep, while the poor man had only one little ewe, whom he cared for greatly. A traveler approached the rich man for food, whereby the man took the poor man&#x27;s ewe and dressed it to give to the traveler.

Hearing this story, David grew angry and replied: &quot;As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.&quot;

Nathan replied, &quot;You are the man! This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: &#x27;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. I gave your master&#x27;s house to you, and your master&#x27;s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah.

&quot;And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. Why did you despise the word of the Lord by doing what is evil in His eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own.

&quot;You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised Me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.&#x27;&quot; NIV - Bible Gateway passage: 2 Samuel 12:5-10 - New International Version

Nathan then informs David that his child with Bathsheba must die. Indeed, their first child dies after seven days. David and Bathsheba later had a second son, the future King Solomon.

==Rabbinic literature==
Because, as the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; notes, the Rabbis &quot;could not admit the existence of any flaw in David&#x27;s character,&quot; their writings tend to paint Uriah as the one at fault: They contended that when he defied David&#x27;s order to go home, he disregarded a royal bidding (Shab. 56a; Tos. to Ḳid. 43a, above).

==Biblical texts mentioning Uriah the Hittite==

&quot;All references from the JPS translation (1917) unless otherwise stated.&quot;

*: These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: [...] &quot;39&quot;: Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.
*: These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. [...] &quot;41&quot;: Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
*: And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? &quot;4&quot;: And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. [&quot;Uriah the Hittite&quot; named four more times in this chapter.]
*: [Nathan:] Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. &quot;10&quot;: Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
*: Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
* &quot;(NAB)&quot;: As the first husband of the mother of Solomon (i.e., Bathsheba) in the genealogy of Jesus.

==Film portrayals==
Uriah is portrayed in the American films &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot; (1951) by Kieron Moore, &quot;King David&quot; (1985) by James Lister and Mark Burnett&#x27;s and Roma Downey&#x27;s &quot;The Bible: The Epic Miniseries&quot; (2013) by Dhaffer L&#x27;Abidine.
