<text>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA; pronounced ) is a branch of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. SAMHSA is charged with improving the quality and availability of treatment and rehabilitative services in order to reduce illness, death, disability, and the cost to society resulting from substance abuse and mental illnesses. The Administrator of SAMHSA reports directly to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. SAMHSA&#x27;s headquarters building is located outside of Rockville, Maryland.

==History==
SAMHSA was established in 1992 by Congress as part of a reorganization stemming from the abolition of Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration (ADAMHA). ADAMHA had been established in 1973, combining the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act consolidated the treatment functions that were previously scattered amongst the NIMH, NIAAA, and NIDA into SAMHSA, established as an agency of the Public Health Service (PHS). NIMH, NIAAA, and NIDA continued with their research functions as agencies within the National Institutes of Health.

Congress directed SAMHSA to target effectively substance abuse and mental health services to the people most in need and to translate research in these areas more effectively and rapidly into the general health care system.

Charles Curie was SAMHSA&#x27;s Director until his resignation in May 2006. In December 2006 Terry Cline was appointed as SAMHSA&#x27;s Director. Dr. Cline served through August 2008. Rear Admiral Eric Broderick served as the Acting Director upon Dr. Cline&#x27;s departure, until the arrival of the succeeding Administrator, Pamela S. Hyde, J.D. in November 2009. She resigned in August 2015 and Kana Enomoto, M.A. served as Acting Director of SAMHSA until Dr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz was appointed as the inaugural Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Abuse. The title was changed by Section 6001 of the 21st Century Cures Act.

==Organization==
SAMHSA&#x27;s mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on American&#x27;s communities.

Four SAMHSA offices, called Centers, administer competitive, formula, and block grant programs and data collection activities:
*The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) focuses on prevention and treatment of mental disorders. 
*The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) seeks to reduce the abuse of illegal drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. 
*The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) supports effective substance abuse treatment and recovery services. 
*The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) collects, analyzes, and publishes behavior health data.

The Centers give grant and contracts to U.S. states, territories, tribes, communities, and local organizations. They support the provision of quality behavioral-health services such as addiction-prevention, treatment, and recovery-support services through competitive Programs of Regional and National Significance grants. Several staff offices support the Centers:
* Office of the Administrator
* Office of Policy, Planning, and Innovation
** Office of Behavioral Health Equity
* Office of Financial Resources
* Office of Management, Technology, and Operations
* Office of Communications
* Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy

===Center for Mental Health Services===
The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is a unit of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This U.S. government agency describes its role as: 

The Center for Mental Health Services leads federal efforts to promote the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Congress created CMHS to bring new hope to adults who have serious mental illness and children with emotional disorders.
, the director of CMHS is Paolo del Vecchio.

CMHS is the driving force behind the largest US children&#x27;s mental health initiative to date, which is focused on creating and sustaining systems of care. This initiative provides grants (now cooperative agreements) to States, political subdivisions of States, territories, Indian Tribes and tribal organizations to improve and expand their Systems Of Care to meet the needs of the focus population—children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders. The Children&#x27;s Mental Health Initiative is the largest Federal commitment to children’s mental health to date, and through FY 2006, it has provided over $950 million to support SOC development in 126 communities.

===Center for Substance Abuse Prevention===
The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) aims to reduce the use of illegal substances and the abuse of legal ones.

CSAP promotes self-esteem and cultural pride as a way to reduce the attractiveness of drugs, advocates raising taxes as a way to discourage drinking alcohol by young people, develops alcohol and drug curricula, and funds research on alcohol and drug abuse prevention. CSAP encourages the use of &quot;evidence-based programs&quot; for drug and alcohol prevention. Evidence-based programs are programs that have been rigorously and scientifically evaluated to show effectiveness in reducing or preventing drug use.

For example the SPF Rx grant program provides resources to help prevent and address prescription drug misuse within a State or locality. Recipients can include relatively small organizations such as PreventionFIRST! an organization coordinating the activities of a number of bodies working within the Cincinnati area, with an annual turnover of around $2m.

The current director of CSAP is Frances Harding.

====History and legal definition====
CSAP was established in 1992 from the previous Office of Substance Abuse Prevention by the law called the ADAMHA Reorganization Act. Defining regulations include those of Title 42.

===Center for Substance Abuse Treatment===
The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) was established in October 1992 with a Congressional mandate to expand the availability of effective treatment and recovery services for alcohol and drug problems. CSAT supports a variety of activities aimed at fulfilling its mission: 
* To improve the lives of individuals and families affected by alcohol and drug abuse by ensuring access to clinically sound, cost-effective addiction treatment that reduces the health and social costs to our communities and the nation. 
CSAT works with States and community-based groups to improve and expand existing substance abuse treatment services under the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Program. CSAT also supports SAMHSA’s free treatment referral service to link people with the community-based substance abuse services they need. Because no single treatment approach is effective for all persons, CSAT supports the nation&#x27;s effort to provide multiple treatment modalities, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and use evaluation results to enhance treatment and recovery approaches.

The current director of CSAT is Louis A. Trevisan, MD

===Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality===
The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) conducts data collection and research on &quot;behavioral health statistics&quot; relating to mental health, addiction, substance use, and related epidemiology. CBHSQ is headed by a Director. Subunits of CBHSQ include:
* Office of Program Analysis and Coordination
* Division of Surveillance and Data Collection
* Division of Evaluation, Analysis and Quality

The Center&#x27;s headquarters are outside of Rockville, Maryland.

The Center is directed by Dr. Naomi Tomoyasu, Ph.D.

<doc id="311834" wikidata="Q7721698" url="?curid=311834" title="The Catch (baseball)">
<text>The Catch was a baseball play made by New York Giants center fielder Willie Mays on September 29, 1954, during Game 1 of the 1954 World Series at the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan, New York City. In the eighth inning, with the score tied 2–2, Cleveland Indians batter Vic Wertz hit a deep fly ball to center field that had the runners on base poised to score. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder catch while on the run to record the out, and his throw back to the infield prevented one of the runners from advancing. The Giants won the game 5–2 in extra innings, and eventually the World Series. The Catch is regarded as one of the greatest plays in baseball history.

==The play==
In the top of the 8th inning, with the score tied 2–2, Giants starting pitcher Sal Maglie walked Indians lead off hitter Larry Doby. Al Rosen singled, putting runners on first and second. New York manager Leo Durocher summoned left-handed relief pitcher Don Liddle to pitch to Cleveland&#x27;s Wertz, a left-handed batter.

Wertz worked the count to two balls and one strike before hitting Liddle&#x27;s fourth pitch about to deep center field. In many stadiums, the ball would have been a home run, which would have given the Indians a 5–2 lead. However, the Polo Grounds center field was the deepest in the league, marked as , and Mays, who was playing in shallow center field, made an on-the-run, over-the-shoulder catch at the warning track for the out. Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw to second base. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag. Mays&#x27; throw went to second base, holding Cleveland to runners at first and third with one out.

Right-hander Marv Grissom then relieved Liddle, who supposedly remarked to coach Freddie Fitzsimmons, &quot;Well, I got &quot;my&quot; man.&quot; Grissom walked pinch hitter Dale Mitchell to load the bases, then struck out pinch hitter Dave Pope, and got catcher Jim Hegan to fly out, ending the inning with no runs scored.

==Broadcast==
Jack Brickhouse, calling the game for NBC television along with Russ Hodges, described Mays&#x27; catch to viewers. The audio has been published on CD with the 2000 book &quot;And the Fans Roared&quot;, and also as accompaniment to the World Series film.

&lt;poem&gt;
Brickhouse: There&#x27;s a long drive... way back at center field... way back, back, it is a... Oh my! Caught by Mays! The runner on second, Doby, is able to go to third. Willie Mays just brought this crowd to its feet with a catch which must have been an optical illusion to a lot of people! Boy! [pause] Notice where that 483 foot mark is in center field? The ball itself—Russ, you know this ballpark better than anyone else I know—had to go about 460, didn&#x27;t it?

Hodges: It certainly did, and I don&#x27;t see how Willie did it, but he&#x27;s been doing it all year.

Brickhouse: Willie Mays just made the catch of the day.
&lt;/poem&gt;

There is some question of the depth of straight-away center field. Sometimes there was a 475 sign in center field, sometimes 483 (as was the case in 1954). The ballpark was demolished in 1964, and it is unclear what was being measured when. One theory is that 475 was the distance to the front of the clubhouse overhang, and 483 was the distance to the rear wall under the overhang. Regardless, the ball was not hit to the deepest part of center field; the spot where Mays made his catch is estimated by baseball researchers not to be more than from home plate.

==Aftermath and response==

The play prevented the Indians from taking the lead and, in the bottom of the 10th, the Giants won the game on their way to sweeping the Series. The Catch is often considered to be one of the best and most memorable plays in the history of baseball because of the difficulty of the play, its importance in the game, and the importance of the game itself. Bob Feller said both that it was a very good catch and: &quot;We knew Willie had the ball all the way.&quot; Later, Feller said, &quot;There&#x27;s three things that made the catch memorable: one, it was a great play. Two, it was in a World Series. And three, it was on national television.&quot;

Mays himself did not believe &quot;The Catch&quot; to be the best defensive play he ever made. In a 2006 CD collection, &quot;Ernie Harwell&#x27;s Audio Scrapbook&quot;, Mays talks about a running &quot;bare-handed&quot; catch he made at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in 1951, after which the Giants&#x27; players teased the young rookie by treating him with complete indifference when he returned to the bench. Mays also cited a catch he made against the center field wall at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York, in which he had to scurry back so fast he did not have time to turn around.

In 2007, a physicist calculated that if the temperature had been rather than , the ball would have traveled farther than it did, and The Catch might not have been completed.

<text>Peter Martin Christopherson (also known as Sleazy; 27 February 1955 – 25 November 2010) was an English musician, video director, commercial artist, designer and photographer, who was at one time a member of British design agency Hipgnosis.

He also co-founded the Industrial Records band Throbbing Gristle (TG). After the disbandment of Throbbing Gristle, he participated in the formation of Psychic TV along with Genesis P-Orridge and Geoff Rushton—Rushton later changed his name to John Balance.

After his short time in Psychic TV, Christopherson formed Coil with Balance, which lasted for just under 23 years, until Balance died of a fall in the Weston-super-Mare home he shared with Christopherson. Christopherson participated in the reunification of Throbbing Gristle and, after his relocation to Thailand in 2005, composed an album for his solo endeavour The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. Christopherson died in his sleep on 25 November 2010.

==Early life==
Christopherson was born on 27 February 1955 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England. His father, Derman Christopherson, was a professor of engineering who became master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. Following school, Christopherson studied computer programming, theatre design, and video at the University at Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, where he developed an interest in performance art and the work of avant-garde photographers such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Arthur Tress.

==Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV, and Coil==
Christopherson was a founding member of Throbbing Gristle, who are credited with creating the industrial music genre before disbanding in 1981. Following the split, members Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti formed Chris &amp; Cosey, while Christopherson and the band&#x27;s other member Genesis P-Orridge formed Psychic TV with John Balance and other musicians.

Balance met Christopherson as a Throbbing Gristle fan and the two became intimate partners. Christopherson worked on the first two Psychic TV albums, &quot;Force the Hand of Chance&quot; and &quot;Dreams Less Sweet&quot;, joined by Balance on the latter. The two performed live several times with Psychic TV prior to forming their own project Coil.

Coil consisted of Christopherson and Balance, while Steven E. Thrower occasionally played bass guitar and drums. Balance was the lyricist and also played Chapman Stick and some keyboards.

Over two decades, Coil released myriad recordings, in addition to contributing to the work of other artists. They recorded parts of the album &quot;The New Backwards&quot; at Nothing Studios in New Orleans, owned by musician Trent Reznor at the time. In the liner notes of the 2008 CD release, Christopherson wrote: &quot;Thanks to everyone there, especially Trent Reznor who made it all possible.&quot;

Despite Christopherson&#x27;s long and extensive history as a musical artist, he only released two tracks under the name &quot;Peter Christopherson&quot;. The first, &quot;In My Head A Crystal Sphere of Heavy Fluid&quot;, appeared on the compilation &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, a benefit album for Balance&#x27;s rehabilitation from alcohol dependence, while the second, &quot;All Possible Numbers&quot;, appeared eleven years later on &quot;Autumn Blood (Constructions)&quot; released on Fourth Dimension Records.

In 2005, following the death of Balance, Christopherson relocated from England to Bangkok, Thailand and founded the solo project The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. He also released the final Coil CDs—&quot;The Remote Viewer&quot;, &quot;Black Antlers&quot;, &quot;...And The Ambulance Died in His Arms&quot; and &quot;The New Backwards&quot;—on the band&#x27;s own Threshold House label. In addition to the CD releases, Christopherson also released a 16-DVD box set following his relocation, entitled &quot;Colour Sound Oblivion&quot;, that was produced in a wooden box, in which a fifteen-page booklet, the program for Balance&#x27;s funeral ceremony and a large collection of 6-inch × 4-inch postcards (mainly tour photographs) were also included.

Throbbing Gristle also reformed for a few concerts in 2005 and announced a new album called &quot;Part Two&quot;. The group announced several additional concerts in 2007 for the promotion of the album.

== Other musical projects ==
In 2007 Christopherson released the debut album of The Threshold HouseBoys Choir. The album, &quot;Form Grows Rampant&quot;, consists of five &quot;parts&quot; or songs, and includes a DVD of the album set to video footage of Thai rituals in Krabi, Thailand. One tour promoter who organized a Threshold HouseBoys Choir concert described it as &quot;easily the most shocking thing I have ever experienced&quot;.

In 2008 Christopherson and Ivan Pavlov (aka CoH) started a new project called Soisong. The band officially premiered in Tokyo on 9 March 2008 and later performed several shows in Europe, having self-released their debut EP. As part of the tour, Soisong performed a live soundtrack to Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Blue&quot; in Rovereto, Italy. In April of the same year, Christopherson and Pavlov, alongside David Tibet, Othon Mataragas and Ernesto Tomasini, also performed a live soundtrack for &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; in Turin, Italy.

In 2009 Soisong recorded their first full-length album &quot;xAj3z&quot;, the release of which was followed by a European &quot;Reunion Tour&quot; and a worldwide campaign in search of the band&#x27;s missing virtual vocalists featured on the record. In 2010 Soisong declared a &quot;Split Phase 2010&quot;, during which all of the members would concentrate on their personal work; however, two independently recorded solo EPs, both entitled &quot;Soisong&quot;, were scheduled for release. Christopherson never finalized his work for the release, but &quot;Soisong Split&quot; was eventually published in September 2012, nearly two years after Christopherson&#x27;s death. The release consists of a CoH &quot;Soisong&quot; EP by Pavlov, originally recorded in 2010, and a collection of four unpublished sketches by Christopherson that were made available on the band&#x27;s website.

In 2010 Christopherson started collaborating with Hirsute Pursuit, featuring Harley Phoenix and Bryin Dall, via email. They finished two songs together, &quot;One Sleazy Night in Bangkok&quot; and &quot;One Sleazy Night in New Orleans&quot;, for the album &quot;Tighten That Muscle Ring&quot;. The album was signed to Cold Spring Records, but Christopherson died prior to its release. Writing for the &quot;Quietus&quot; online publication, Luke Turner claimed that the album was &quot;the most sexy and perverted album of 2012&quot;.

Also in 2010, Christopherson was sent an iPad by musician Trent Reznor that contained music for a potential collaboration. Reznor had asked for his blessing to use the moniker &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot; for a musical project that Reznor was creating with his wife (Christopherson had used the phrase in 1984, as the title of the first recording released by Coil). Christopherson responded amenably, suggesting that they could potentially collaborate as part of the project. Christopherson explained that Reznor was a &quot;perfect gentleman&quot; in regard to the way in which the matter was negotiated; however, Christopherson died before he was able to resend the iPad back to Reznor with his contribution.

The final music that was ever recorded by Christopherson occurred in Bangkok, Thailand with a project named &quot;Electric Sewer Age&quot; that also involved musician Danny Hyde. The original intention of the recordings was to complete a series of releases called &quot;Moons Milk&quot;, but an album called &quot;In Final Phase&quot; was eventually released in 2013, with only 999 numbered CD copies made available. The CD is packaged in record sleeve-style thickened cardboard, and each copy is numbered from 1 to 999, while the insert sleeve displays a picture of Christopherson in his Bangkok studio that was taken at the moment that the recording was completed.

==Influence==

Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Dave Simpson credited Christopherson with using digital samplers on-stage before the Fairlight CMI popularised sampling. Also writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis described Carter and Christopherson as &quot;pioneers in technology&quot;, and noted a sampler that Carter had custom-built for Christopherson a number of years before sampling became popular. Christopherson explained Carter&#x27;s construction and musical experimentation in a 1987 interview with &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine:
It was a box that [TG synthesist] Chris Carter made for me, to my design that basically switched on and off – through inputs on tape recorders – six cassette machines, the output of each going to a different key. Many of the machines I used in TG were cassette machines that were stripped down and altered to play backward and forward and four tracks at once, the speed variable by flywheels. The very first sampling device there ever was, as far as I know, was manufactured by Mountain Hardware for Apple computers. It was designed to reproduce voice samples, and had a very limited selection of pitches. I was using that onstage in &#x27;79 or &#x27;80, which was before the first Fairlight was used commercially. So I&#x27;ve always had a soft spot for sampling.

==Visual art==
Prior to his musical projects, Christopherson was a commercial artist, designer, and photographer. Notably, he was one of the three partners of the album cover design group Hipgnosis, which was responsible for many notable album covers of the 1970s, such as those of Pink Floyd (&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;) and Peter Gabriel (first three albums). He also designed the logo of UK fashion label BOY London.

As a freelance photographer, Christopherson shot the first promotional images of the Sex Pistols in 1976. He later provided design work for SEX, the fashion boutique owned by Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood.

Christopherson remained involved with commercial art up until his later life. He directed over 40 music videos—for artists such as Rage Against the Machine, The The, Van Halen, Sepultura and Robert Plant—and was responsible for a high number of television commercials. He filmed and directed the &quot;Threshold HouseBoys Choir&quot; DVD that was filmed in Thailand, as well as the infamous &quot;Broken&quot;. November 2014 saw the publication of a big retrospective book simply called &quot;Peter Christopherson - Photography&quot; by Edition Timeless, collecting a lot of unseen photos from all areas of his work in photography but focusing on his private work.

==Death==
Christopherson died in his sleep on 25 November 2010, aged 55. The cause of death was never made public. At the time of his death, Christopherson was working on a complete re-working of Nico&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;Desertshore&quot;, to be released as the Throbbing Gristle album &quot;The Desertshore Installation&quot;.

==Legacy==
In addition to numerous other tributes, P-Orridge wrote a lengthy eulogy for Christopherson, in which they concluded:
Sleazy loved Bangkok and Thailand. He had been visiting regularly for several years before deciding to move there permanently after John/Jhonn/Geoff passed on. While we were spending time in 2009 with him we were pretty sick from the intense emotional stress of our ceremony in Nepal for the reliving and releasing of a beloved. Sleazy became a source of every suture for my heart, loving sustenance for my soul. He nurtured me with words of wise counsel garnered from his own similar and tragic losses. There had been a long sometimes desolate expanse between the seventies and now. But we had both crossed our abyss and we were blessed by Sleazy&#x27;s loving nature to be able to accept his gentle embrace and, crying like a child we often are, be able to lovingly say to him, &quot;I HAVE GOT MY FRIEND BACK.&quot; Many times, since then, we have stopped during hard times, confusing times, and we think of Sleazy and how his mastery of light went from cameras to hearts and souls, and that makes me smile and laugh. Which is as he would wish. We loved Sleazy in all he did...

Peter Gabriel published a brief post on his website on 26 November 2010 that opened with the statement: &quot;We tip our hats to Mr Peter Christopherson&quot;. Speaking to the &quot;Quietus&quot; website in February 2014, Reznor stated: &quot;[Coil&#x27;s] &#x27;Tainted Love&#x27; video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time ... If it&#x27;s not immediately obvious: &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically ... Peter was a lovely guy. We had a respectful relationship.&quot;

<text>Ronald David Laing (7 October 1927 – 23 August 1989), usually cited as R. D. Laing, was a Scottish psychiatrist who wrote extensively on mental illnessin particular, psychosis and schizophrenia.

Laing&#x27;s views on the causes and treatment of psychopathological phenomena were influenced by his study of existential philosophy and ran counter to the chemical and electroshock methods that had become psychiatric orthodoxy. Laing took the expressed feelings of the individual patient or client as valid descriptions of personal experience rather than simply as symptoms of mental illness. Though associated in the public mind with the anti-psychiatry movement, he rejected the label. Laing regarded schizophrenia as the normal psychological adjustment to a dysfunctional social context. 

Politically, Laing was regarded as a thinker of the New Left. He was portrayed by David Tennant in the 2017 film &quot;Mad to Be Normal&quot;.

==Early years==
Laing was born in the Govanhill district of Glasgow on 7 October 1927, the only child of civil engineer David Park MacNair Laing and Amelia Glen Laing (née Kirkwood). Laing described his parents his mother especially as being somewhat anti-social, and demanding the maximum achievement from him. Although his biographer son largely discounted Laing&#x27;s childhood account, an obituary by an acquaintance of Laing asserted that about his parents – &quot;the full truth he told only to a few close friends&quot;.

He was educated initially at Sir John Neilson Cuthbertson Public School and after four years transferred to Hutchesons&#x27; Grammar School. Described variously as clever, competitive or precocious, he studied classics, particularly philosophy, including through reading books from the local library. Small and slightly built, Laing participated in distance running; he was also a musician, being made an Associate of the Royal College of Music. He studied medicine at the University of Glasgow. During his time in Glasgow, he set up a &quot;Socratic Club&quot;, of which the philosopher Bertrand Russell agreed to be president. Laing failed his final exams. In a partial autobiography, &quot;Wisdom, Madness and Folly,&quot; Laing said he felt remarks he made under the influence of alcohol at a university function had offended the staff and led to him being failed on every subject including some he was sure he had passed. After spending six months working in a psychiatric unit, Laing passed the re-sits in 1951 to qualify as a medical doctor.

==Career==
Laing spent a couple of years as a psychiatrist in the British Army Psychiatric Unit at Netley, where, as he later recalled, those trying to fake schizophrenia to get a lifelong disability pension were likely to get more than they had bargained for as insulin shock therapy was being used. In 1953, Laing returned to Glasgow, participated in an existentialism-oriented discussion group, and worked at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital. The hospital was influenced by David Henderson&#x27;s school of thought, which may have exerted an unacknowledged influence on Laing; he became the youngest consultant in the country. Laing&#x27;s colleagues characterised him as &quot;conservative&quot; for his opposition to electroconvulsive therapy and the new drugs that were being introduced.

In 1956, Laing went to train on a grant at the Tavistock Clinic in London, widely known as a centre for the study and practice of psychotherapy (particularly psychoanalysis). At this time, he was associated with John Bowlby, D. W. Winnicott and Charles Rycroft. He remained at the Tavistock Clinic until 1964.

In 1965, Laing and a group of colleagues created the Philadelphia Association and started a psychiatric community project at Kingsley Hall, where patients and therapists lived together. The Norwegian author Axel Jensen contacted Laing at Kingsley Hall after reading his book &quot;The Divided Self&quot;, which had been given to him by Noel Cobb. Laing treated Jensen, and subsequently, they became close friends. Laing often visited Jensen on board his ship &quot;Shanti Devi&quot;, which was his home in Stockholm.

In 1967, Laing appeared on the BBC programme &quot;Your Witness&quot;, chaired by Ludovic Kennedy, on which, alongside Jonathan Aitken and G.P. Ian Dunbar, he argued for the legalisation of cannabis in the first live television debate on the subject. In the same years, his views were explored in the television play &quot;In Two Minds&quot;, written by David Mercer.

In October 1972, Laing met Arthur Janov, author of the popular book &quot;The Primal Scream&quot;. Although Laing found Janov modest and unassuming, he considered him a &quot;jig man&quot; (someone who knows a lot about a little). Laing sympathized with Janov but regarded his primal therapy as a lucrative business—one which required no more than obtaining a suitable space and letting people &quot;hang it all out&quot;.

Inspired by the work of American psychotherapist Elizabeth Fehr, Laing began to develop a team offering &quot;rebirthing workshops&quot; in which one designated person chooses to re-experience the struggle of trying to break out of the birth canal represented by the remaining members of the group who surround him or her. Many former colleagues regarded him as a brilliant mind gone wrong but there were some who thought Laing was somewhat psychotic.

===Laing and anti-psychiatry===
Laing was seen as an important figure in the anti-psychiatry movement, along with David Cooper, although he never denied the value of treating mental distress.

He also challenged psychiatric diagnosis itself, arguing that the diagnosis of a mental disorder contradicted accepted medical procedure: the diagnosis was made on the basis of behaviour or conduct of an examination and ancillary tests that traditionally precede the diagnosis of viable pathologies (like broken bones or pneumonia) occurred after the diagnosis of mental disorder (if at all). Hence, according to Laing, psychiatry was founded on a false epistemology: illness diagnosed by conduct but treated biologically.

Laing maintained that schizophrenia was &quot;a theory not a fact&quot;; he believed leading medical geneticists did not accept the models of genetically inherited schizophrenia being promoted by biologically based psychiatry. He rejected the &quot;medical model of mental illness&quot;—according to Laing, diagnosis of mental illness did not follow a traditional medical model—and this led him to question the use of medication such as antipsychotics by psychiatry. His attitude to recreational drugs was quite different; privately, he advocated an anarchy of experience.

Politically, Laing was regarded as a thinker of the New Left.

==Personal life==
In his early life, Laing&#x27;s father, David, an electrical engineer who had served in the Royal Air Force, seems often to have come to blows with his own brother, and had a breakdown himself for three months when Laing was a teenager. His mother Amelia, according to some speculation and rumour about her behaviour, has been described as &quot;psychologically peculiar&quot;.

Laing was troubled by his own personal problems, suffering from both episodic alcoholism and clinical depression, according to his self-diagnosis in a BBC Radio interview with Anthony Clare in 1983, although he reportedly was free of both in the years before his death. These admissions were to have serious consequences for Laing as they formed part of the case against him by the General Medical Council which led to him ceasing to practise medicine.

Laing fathered six sons and four daughters by four women. After his rise as a celebrity, Laing left his first wife Anne Hearne, a former nursing student (m. 1952–1966), and their five children. Subsequently, he married German graphic designer Jutta Werner (m. 1974–1986) with whom he fathered three children. His ninth child, Benjamin, with German therapist Sue Sünkel, was born in 1984. In 1988 Laing&#x27;s partner until his death, Marguerite, gave birth to his tenth child, Charles. Laing died 19 months later of a heart attack at the age of 61 while playing tennis.

His son Adrian, speaking in 2008, said, &quot;It was ironic that my father became well known as a family psychiatrist, when, in the meantime, he had nothing to do with his own family&quot;. His oldest child Fiona, born in 1952, spent years in mental institutions and was treated for schizophrenia. His daughter Susan died in 1976, aged 21, of leukaemia. Adam, his oldest son by his second marriage, who had been in an increasingly melancholic and fragile state of mind, was found dead in May 2008 in a tent on the island of Formentera. He had died of a heart attack, aged 41.

==Works==
In 1913, psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers had pronounced, in his work, &quot;General Psychopathology&quot;, that many of the symptoms of mental illness (and particularly of delusions) were &quot;un-understandable&quot;, and therefore were worthy of little consideration except as a sign of some other underlying primary disorder. Then, in 1956, Gregory Bateson and his colleagues, Donald Jackson, and Jay Haley articulated a theory of schizophrenia as stemming from double bind situations where a person receives different or contradictory messages. The perceived symptoms of schizophrenia were therefore an expression of this distress, and should be valued as a cathartic and transformative experience. Laing argued a similar account for psychoses: that the strange behavior and seemingly confused speech of people undergoing a psychotic episode were ultimately understandable as an attempt to communicate worries and concerns, often in situations where this was not possible or not permitted. Laing stressed the role of society, and particularly the family, in the development of &quot;madness&quot; (his term).

Laing saw psychopathology as being seated not in biological or psychic organs whereby environment is relegated to playing at most only an accidental role as immediate trigger of disease (the &quot;stress diathesis model&quot; of the nature and causes of psychopathology) but rather in the social cradle, the urban home, which cultivates it, the very crucible in which selves are forged. This re-evaluation of the locus of the disease process and consequent shift in forms of treatment was in stark contrast to psychiatric orthodoxy (in the broadest sense we have of ourselves as psychological subjects and pathological selves). Laing was revolutionary in valuing the content of psychotic behaviour and speech as a valid expression of distress, albeit wrapped in an enigmatic language of personal symbolism which is meaningful only from within their situation.

Laing expanded the view of the &quot;double bind&quot; hypothesis put forth by Bateson and his team, and came up with a new concept to describe the highly complex situation that unfolds in the process of &quot;going mad&quot; an &quot;incompatible knot&quot;.

Laing never denied the existence of mental illness, but viewed it in a radically different light from his contemporaries. For Laing, mental illness could be a transformative episode whereby the process of undergoing mental distress was compared to a shamanic journey. The traveler could return from the journey with important insights, and may have become (in the views of Laing and his followers) a wiser and more grounded person as a result (Louis, B., 2006, Moving Beyond Prozac, DSM, and the New Psychiatry).

In &quot;The Divided Self&quot; (1960), Laing contrasts the experience of the &quot;ontologically secure&quot; person with that of a person who &quot;cannot take the realness, aliveness, autonomy and identity of himself and others for granted&quot; and who consequently contrives strategies to avoid &quot;losing his self&quot;. This concept is used to develop a psychodynamic model of the mind to explain psychosis and schizophrenia. Laing&#x27;s theories resemble later ideas about self-disorder as a core characteristic of schizophrenia.

In &quot;Self and Others&quot; (1961), Laing&#x27;s definition of normality shifted somewhat.

Laing also wrote poetry and his poetry publications include &quot;Knots&quot; (1970, published by Penguin) and &quot;Sonnets&quot; (1979, published by Michael Joseph).

Laing appears, alongside his son Adam, on the 1980 album &quot;Miniatures – a sequence of fifty-one tiny masterpieces&quot; edited by Morgan Fisher, performing the song &quot;Tipperary&quot;.

==Influence==
In 1965 Laing co-founded the UK charity the Philadelphia Association, concerned with the understanding and relief of mental suffering, which he also chaired. His work influenced the wider movement of therapeutic communities, operating in less &quot;confrontational&quot; (in a Laingian perspective) psychiatric settings. Other organizations created in a Laingian tradition are the Arbours Association, the New School of Psychotherapy and Counselling in London, and the R.D. Laing in the 21st Century Symposium held annually at Esalen Institute, where Laing frequently taught.

<doc id="311843" wikidata="Q558122" url="?curid=311843" title="David Cooper (psychiatrist)">
<text>David Graham Cooper (1931 in Cape Town, South Africa – 29 July 1986 in Paris, France) was a South African-born psychiatrist and theorist who was prominent in the anti-psychiatry movement.

Cooper graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1955. R.D. Laing claimed that Cooper underwent Soviet training to prepare him as an anti-apartheid communist revolutionary, but after completing his course he never returned to South Africa out of fear that the Bureau of State Security would eliminate him. He moved to London, where he worked at several hospitals. From 1961 to 1965 he ran an experimental unit for young people with schizophrenia called &quot;Villa 21&quot;, which he saw as a revolutionary &#x27;anti-hospital&#x27; and a prototype for the later Kingsley Hall Community. In 1965, he was involved with Laing and others in establishing the Philadelphia Association. An &quot;existential Marxist,&quot; he left the Philadelphia Association in the 1970s in a disagreement over its lack of political orientation. Cooper coined the term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; in 1967, and wrote the book &quot;Psychiatry and Anti-psychiatry&quot; in 1971. He also co-founded the Antiuniversity of London in February 1968.

==Leading concepts==
Cooper believed that madness and psychosis are the manifestation of a disparity between one&#x27;s own &#x27;true&#x27; identity and our social identity (the identity others give us and we internalise). Cooper&#x27;s ultimate solution was through revolution. To this end, Cooper travelled to Argentina as he felt the country was rife with revolutionary potential. He later returned to England before moving to France where he spent the last years of his life.

Cooper coined the term anti-psychiatry (see below) to describe opposition and opposing methods to the orthodox psychiatry of the time.

He coordinated the Congress on the Dialectics of Liberation, held in London at The Roundhouse in Chalk Farm from 15 July to 30 July 1967. Participants included R. D. Laing, Paul Goodman, Allen Ginsberg, Herbert Marcuse and the Black Panthers&#x27; Stokely Carmichael. Jean-Paul Sartre was scheduled to appear but cancelled at the last moment. The term &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; was first used by David Cooper in 1967.

He was a founding member of the Philadelphia Association, London.

==Family and &quot;The Death of the Family&quot;==

Cooper describes how &#x27;during the end of the writing of this book against the family, I went through a profound spiritual and bodily crisis...The people who sat with me and tended to me with immense kindliness and concern during the worst of this crisis were my brother Peter and sister-in-law Carol...a true family&#x27;.

He had earlier described the need to break free from &#x27;one&#x27;s whole family past...in a way that is more personally effective than a simple aggressive rupture or crude acts of geographical separation&#x27;; as well as the kind of false autonomy which occurs when &#x27;people are still very much in the net of the internal family (and often the external family too) and compulsively search for rather less restricting replica family systems&#x27;.

The book may thus be seen as a self-reflexive attempt &#x27;to illustrate the power of the internal family, the family that one can separate from over thousands of miles and yet still remain in its clutches and be strangled by those clutches&#x27;.

==&quot;The Language of Madness&quot;==

In 1967, &#x27;David Cooper provided an introduction to Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Madness and Civilization&quot; which began &quot;Madness has in our age become some sort of lost truth&quot;&#x27; - a statement not atypical of &#x27;a time which posterity now readily regards as half-crazed&#x27;. Continuing the same line of thought, by the end of the following decade, &#x27;he elevated madness to the status of a liberatory force&#x27; in his last publication. Here are a few typical utterances from &quot;The Language of Madness&quot; (Cooper 1980): &quot;Madness is permanent revolution in the life of a person...a deconstitution of oneself with the implicit promise of return to a more fully realized world&quot;&#x27;.

<text>Gija, also spelt Gidja and Kija, alternatively known as the Lungga, refers to Aboriginal Australians from the East Kimberley area of Western Australia, about south of Kununurra. In the late 19th century pastoralists were fiercely resisted by Gija people, many of whom now live around localities such as Halls Creek and Warmun (also known as Turkey Creek).

==Language==
Gija does not belong to the Pama-Nyungan language family which covers most Australian Aboriginal tongues, but is a member of the small Jarrakan language group. It is still spoken by from 100 to 200 people. 

A Gija-English dictionary was published in 2022, while a book of Gija terms for the plants and animals encountered and used by Gija people was published in 2018.

==Country==
The Gija&#x27;s traditional territory consisted of an estimated , on Salmond, Chamberlain, and Wilson rivers. The western boundary ran up to the foothills of the Bluff Face Range. They also lived and hunted around the upper Margaret River, above the Ramsay Range gorge. Their easternmost lands ran as far as Halls Creek and Alice Downs. Sites associated with the Gija are Macphee Creek, as far north as Sugarloaf Hill, the Durack Range, Lissadell and Turkey Creek Station, Fig Tree Pool and the headwaters of Stony River.

==History of contact==
The last known massacre of the Gija people took place at Bedford Downs Station in 1924, when, according to Gija tradition, Paddy Quilty and others at the Bedford station took tribesmen off the station and fed them food laced with strychnine. The corpses of those killed were then heaped up and burnt on a funeral pyre to eliminate traces of the killings.

==Modern period==

In 1979, mining explorations teams discovered pink and reddish diamonds, quite rare at the time, at Smoke Creek and at Barramundi Gap, a key site in Gija female dreaming. Subsequently the Argyle diamond mine was established. Employment of local people remained low, 10% in 2003, when strategies changed. Now a quarter of the workforce is recruited from local indigenous people.

The Gija have maintained a strong tradition of cultural preservation and active programs include a repository of teaching materials and artwork. Qantas adapted Paddy Bedford&#x27;s artwork for use on a Boeing 737.

==Notable people==
* Paddy Bedford (1922–2007), Gija artist
* Josie Farrer, Australian parliamentarian. Member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia since 2013, representing the seat of Kimberley.
*Stacy Mader, the first Aboriginal Australian to obtain a PhD in astronomy.
* Lena Nyadbi, Gija artist whose works on barramundi scale designs have been exhibited in Paris, notable on the roof of the Musee du Quai Branly, and only viewable from the Eiffel Tower. The work was commissioned by the Museum; Nyadbi&#x27;s design represents the dreaming story of the barramundi, eluding capture to shed its scales across the landscape. The scales are metaphors for the pink Argyle diamonds, now mined by Rio Tinto on Gija land. With the positioning on the rooftop, Nyadbi&#x27;s intent was to have the barramundi appear poised to flip back into the Seine.

<text>Eparchy ( &quot;eparchía&quot; &quot;overlordship&quot;) is an ecclesiastical unit in Eastern Christianity that is equivalent to a diocese in Western Christianity. An eparchy is governed by an &quot;eparch&quot;, who is a bishop. Depending on the administrative structure of a specific Eastern Church, an eparchy can belong to an ecclesiastical province (usually a metropolis), but it can also be exempt. Each eparchy is divided into parishes, in the same manner as a diocese in Western Churches. Historical development of eparchies in various Eastern Churches was marked by local distinctions that can be observed in modern ecclesiastical practices of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches and Eastern Catholic Churches.

==Terminology==
The English word &quot;eparchy&quot; is an anglicized term that comes from the original Greek word (, ). It is an abstract noun, formed with an intensive prefix (, , + , , ). It is commonly Latinized as &quot;eparchia&quot;. The term can be loosely translated as the rule over something (literally: an overlordship). The term had various meanings and multiple uses throughout history, mainly in politics and administration, starting from the Hellenistic period, and continuing throughout the Roman era.

In the Greco-Roman world, it was used as a Greek equivalent for the Latin term &quot;provincia&quot;, denoting province, the main administrative unit of the Roman Empire. The same use was employed in the early Byzantine Empire until major administrative reforms that were undertaken between the 7th and 9th centuries, abolishing the old provincial system. In modern times, the term was also employed within administrative systems of some countries, like Greece and Cyprus.

Since it was commonly used as the main Greek designation for an administrative province of the Roman Empire, the term &quot;eparchy&quot; consequently gained an additional use among Greek-speaking Christians, denoting ecclesiastical structures on the provincial level of Church administration, within Eastern Christianity. Such terminological borrowing resulted from the final consolidation of the provincial (metropolitan) system in the 4th century. The First Ecumenical Council (325) confirmed (Canon IV) that all bishops of each civil province should be grouped in one ecclesiastical province, headed by a metropolitan (bishop of the provincial capital). Since civil provinces were called eparchies in Greek, the same term was used to define ecclesiastical provinces. Such use became customary, and metropolitan provinces came to be known as &quot;eparchies&quot;.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==

Throughout the late antiquity and the early medieval period, within Eastern Orthodox terminology, the term &quot;eparchy&quot; remained a common designation for a metropolitan province i.e. &quot;metropolis&quot; (, ).

During the later medieval period, terminology started to shift, particularly within the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The process of title-inflation that was affecting Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy also gained momentum in ecclesiastical circles. In order to promote centralization, patriarchal authorities started to multiply the numbers of metropolitans by elevating local bishops to honorary metropolitan ranks without giving them any real metropolitan powers, and making them directly appointed and thus more dependent on Constantinople. As a consequence, the use of the word &quot;eparchy&quot; was expanded to include not only proper metropolitan provinces, but also the newly created honorary metropolitan sees that were no real provinces, and thus no different then simple bishoprics except in honorary titles and ranks. In spite of that, such honorary metropolitan sees also came to be called &quot;eparchies&quot;. This process was systematically promoted, thus resulting in a major terminological shift.


Since the fragmentation of the original metropolitan provinces into several titular metropolises that were also referred to as &quot;eparchies&quot;, the Patriarchate of Constantinople became more centralized, and such structure has remained up to the present day. Similar ecclesiastical terminology is also employed by other autocephalous and autonomous churches within Eastern Orthodox community. In those who are non-Greek, term &quot;eparchy&quot; is used in local variants, and also has various equivalents in local languages.

Eparchies of the main Eastern Orthodox churches:
* Eparchies of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople
* Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria
* Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antiochia
* Eparchies of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem
* Eparchies of the Russian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Romanian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Georgian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Cypriot Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Orthodox Church of Greece
* Eparchies of the Polish Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Albanian Orthodox Church
* Eparchies of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church

==Eastern Catholic Churches==
In the Eastern Catholic Churches, eparchy is equivalent to a diocese of the Latin Church, and its bishop can be called an eparch (equivalent to a diocesan of the Latin Church). Similarly, an archeparchy is equivalent to an archdiocese of the Latin Church and its bishop can be called an archeparch (equivalent to an archbishop of the Roman Rite).

Individual eparchies of some Eastern Catholic Churches may be suffragan to Latin Church metropolitans. For example, the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci is suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb. Also, some minor Eastern Catholic churches have Latin prelates. For example, the Macedonian Greek Catholic Church is organized as a single Eparchy of Strumica-Skopje, whose present ordinary is the Roman Catholic bishop of Skopje.

<text>The Punisher (Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Castle, born Castiglione) is an antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Gerry Conway and artists John Romita Sr. and Ross Andru. The Punisher made his first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129 (cover-dated February 1974), originally depicted as an assassin and adversary of the superhero Spider-Man.

The character is depicted as an Italian-American vigilante who employs murder, kidnapping, extortion, coercion, threats of violence, and torture in his campaign against crime. Driven by the deaths of his wife and two children, who were killed by the mob for witnessing a killing in New York City&#x27;s Central Park, the Punisher wages a one-man war on crime. Castle is a veteran U.S. Marine Corps Scout/Sniper in Force Recon. The stories initially place his military service in the Vietnam War, but this was much later updated alternately to the fictional Siancong War and the Iraq War. Castle is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, guerrilla warfare, and marksmanship. He is well known for the skull motif on his chest, envisioned by his creators as a skull-and-crossbones symbol on his right breast. The symbol has since become widely controversial after becoming appropriated by hate groups, law enforcement groups and United States military personnel, often to symbolize bigotry, openness to murder, and American superiority; thus, in the 2022 run featuring the character, Marvel abandoned the logo permanently and instead has Castle, after joining The Hand, adopting a new logo inspired by the Japanese mythological demon &quot;Oni&quot;.

The Punisher&#x27;s brutal nature and willingness to kill made him an anomaly in mainstream American comic books when he debuted in 1974. By the late 1980s, the Punisher was part of a wave of psychologically troubled antiheroes. At the height of his popularity, the character was featured in four monthly publications: &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot;, &quot;The Punisher: War Zone&quot;, and &quot;The Punisher Armory&quot;. An alternate future version of the character dubbed the &quot;Cosmic Ghost Rider&quot;, created by Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw, began publication in 2018 as a &quot;Thanos&quot; supporting character, becoming a breakout character and receiving his own ongoing series, often coming into opposition with his past self. In 2017, following the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, where Jim &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes met his death at the hands of Thanos, Nick Fury, Jr. obtained the War Machine armor from a black market syndicate and persuaded Punisher to don the armor and carry on in Rhodes&#x27; name, succeeding him as the second [[War Machine (comics)|War Machine]] for a short while, customizing the armor with his skull motif. Following Rhodes&#x27; resurrection alongside Tony Stark for the &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; initiative, Castle relinquished the armor and title to him and resumed as Punisher.

Despite his violent actions and dark nature, the Punisher has enjoyed some mainstream success on television, making guest appearances on series such as &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;, where the depiction of his violent behavior was toned down for family viewers.

In feature films, Dolph Lundgren portrayed the character in the 1989 film &quot;The Punisher&quot;, as did Thomas Jane in the 2004 film &quot;The Punisher&quot;, and Ray Stevenson in 2008&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Jon Bernthal portrayed the character in the second season of &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2016), the spin-off &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2017-2019) and will reprise the role in &quot;&quot; (2025), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

==Publication history==
===First appearances===
The Punisher was conceived by Gerry Conway, then-writer of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Conway was inspired by &quot;The Executioner&quot;, a popular book series created by author Don Pendleton, in which a Vietnam veteran, Mack Bolan, becomes a serial killer of criminals after the Mafia-related deaths of his family. Conway said in a 1987 interview that &quot;I was fascinated by the Don Pendleton Executioner character, which was fairly popular at the time, and I wanted to do something that was inspired by that, although not to my mind a copy of it. And while I was doing the Jackal storyline, the opportunity came for a character who would be used by the Jackal to make Spider-Man&#x27;s life miserable. The Punisher seemed to fit.&quot;

Conway created the unique outfit for the character along with John Romita Sr. As Conway recalled in 2002, &quot;In the &#x27;70s, when I was writing comics at DC and Marvel, I made it a practice to sketch my own ideas for the costumes of new characters—heroes and villains—which I offered to the artists as a crude suggestion representing the image I had in mind. I had done that with the Punisher at Marvel.&quot; Conway had drawn a character with a small death&#x27;s head skull on one breast. Marvel art director John Romita, Sr. took the basic design and blew the skull up to huge size, taking up most of the character&#x27;s chest. &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; penciller Ross Andru was the first artist to draw the character for publication.

Stan Lee, then Marvel&#x27;s editor-in-chief, recalled in 2005 that he had suggested the character&#x27;s name:

Appearing for the first time in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129 (Feb. 1974), the Punisher was initially an antagonist of the titular hero. He was portrayed as a bloodthirsty vigilante who had no qualms about killing gangsters, something which most superheroes of the time refrained from doing. J. Jonah Jameson described him as &quot;the most newsworthy thing to happen to New York since Boss Tweed&quot;. In this appearance, the Punisher is determined to kill Spider-Man, who is wanted for the apparent murder of Norman Osborn. The Punisher is shown as a formidable fighter, skilled marksman, and able strategist. All he reveals about himself is that he is a former U.S. Marine. He has a fierce temper but also shows signs of considerable frustration over his self-appointed role of killer vigilante. He is engaged in extensive soul-searching as to what is the right thing to do: although he has few qualms about killing, he is outraged when his then-associate, the Jackal, apparently kills an enemy by treacherous means rather than in honorable combat. Spider-Man, who is himself no stranger to such torment, concludes that the Punisher&#x27;s problems made his own seem like a &quot;birthday party&quot;.

The character was a hit with readers and started to appear on a regular basis, teaming up with both Spider-Man and other heroes such as Captain America and Nightcrawler throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Conway said the Punisher&#x27;s popularity took him by surprise, as he had intended him only as a second-tier character.

The Punisher appeared in Frank Miller&#x27;s acclaimed run on &quot;Daredevil&quot;. Miller contrasts the Punisher&#x27;s version of vigilantism to the more liberal approach of Daredevil. In an interview, Miller argues that Punisher is &quot;Batman without the impurities&quot;: that, like Batman, Punisher is driven by an unquenchable need to avenge the loss of his loved ones, but that he lacks the limitation of mercy that Batman places on his actions. Miller believes that Punisher is heroic, but not a role model, because readers should not wish to emulate his behavior.

===Initial series===
In the early 1980s, writer and college student Steven Grant was at a comics convention in New York City. At the time he was living with Duffy Vohland, an employee in Marvel&#x27;s production department. Vohland encouraged Grant to pitch story ideas to Marvel, and arranged an interview with then-editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman. Grant proposed the Punisher among other ideas, because he believed no other Marvel writer was working with the character at the time. However, the Punisher was the lead in a black-and-white magazine being written by Archie Goodwin, making the character unavailable for Grant&#x27;s use. A couple of years later Grant began writing for Marvel after Roger Stern became a Marvel editor there and asked Grant to write something for him. Grant began pushing for a &quot;Punisher&quot; miniseries, but this was met with disinterest from editorial, as the character was not thought of as one that readers would care about. In 1980, Grant collaborated on &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #94 with artist Mike Zeck. In 1984, Zeck illustrated Marvel&#x27;s first &quot;Secret Wars&quot; miniseries, which raised his profile in the Marvel offices, where editors were thinking in terms of talent &quot;stables&quot; that worked exclusively for each editor. A new editor, Carl Potts, was looking for projects, so Grant and Zeck pitched a &quot;Punisher&quot; miniseries to him, and Potts accepted it, over much objection from Marvel management.

The miniseries premiered with a January 1986 cover date. It was bannered on the cover as the first of four; although the series had always been intended to be five issues long, and the banner was an error that recurred throughout the entire run. The plot changed from Grant&#x27;s initial story, though the basic concept remained the same. An important element of the story was a retcon that explains that many of the Punisher&#x27;s more extreme actions to this point were the result of being poisoned with mind-altering drugs.

An ongoing series, also titled &quot;The Punisher&quot;, premiered the next year. Initially by writer Mike Baron and artist Klaus Janson, it eventually ran 104 issues (July 1987 – July 1995) and spun off two additional ongoing series—&quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; (80 issues, November 1988 – July 1995) and &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot; (41 issues, March 1992 – July 1995), as well as the black-and-white comics magazine &quot;The Punisher Magazine&quot; (16 issues, November 1989 – September 1990) and &quot;The Punisher Armory&quot; (10 issues, no cover dates, starting 1990), a fictional diary detailing &quot;His thoughts! His feelings! His weapons!&quot; (as stated on the cover of issue #1). The Punisher also appeared in numerous one-shots and miniseries, and made frequent guest appearances in other Marvel comics, ranging from superhero series to the Vietnam War-era comic &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;.

During this era, the Punisher was assisted by his then-partner, Microchip. Serving as a Q type figure, he would supply the Punisher with high-tech vehicles and equipment such as armored combat &quot;battle vans&quot; specially built and customized.

Over the next decade, the Punisher would be shown fighting virtually every known criminal organization, including the Italian Mafia, the Russian Bratva, the Japanese yakuza, the Colombian and Mexican drug cartels, the Aryan Brotherhood, the Chinese Triads, Jamaican Yardies, the Irish Mob, biker gangs, street gangs, gunrunning militias, muggers, killers, rapists, psychopaths, violent racists, sadists, pedophiles, and corrupt city officials. He also assaults criminal business enterprises such as drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, money laundering, and human trafficking.

Due to the Punisher&#x27;s homicidal nature, few of his foes became recurring antagonists, the most notable of these being the severely-scarred enforcer Jigsaw and the brutal sadistic mercenary Barracuda. The Punisher also acquired a nemesis in the form of the Kingpin, a longtime Spider-Man and Daredevil foe, and developed enmity with Daredevil himself, who likewise abhorred and fought against the Punisher&#x27;s brutal methods. Villains such as the Jackal, Bushwacker, Doctor Doom, the Reavers and Bullseye would be used to provide more of a challenge for the character. In addition, heroes such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, the Hulk, Wolverine, Nick Fury, and Moon Knight – and, on at least two occasions, the preadolescent team Power Pack – would appear. Often the stories would use the appearance of those heroes to provide commentary on the difference between the Punisher and those more colourful characters. During Don Daley&#x27;s run on &quot;The Punisher&quot; title, his version of justice was described by the editor as &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;.

===Decline===
In 1995, Marvel canceled all three ongoing Punisher series due to poor sales. The publisher attempted a re-launch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series &quot;Punisher&quot;, under the new Marvel Edge imprint, by writer John Ostrander, in which the Punisher willingly joined and became the boss of an organized crime family, and later confronted the X-Men and Nick Fury. The series ran for 18 issues, from November 1995 to April 1997. Writer Christopher Golden&#x27;s four-issue Marvel Knights miniseries &quot;The Punisher: Purgatory&quot; (November 1998 – February 1999) posited a deceased Punisher resurrected as a supernatural agent of various angels and demons. This version of the character also appeared in a 4-issue mini-series co-starring Wolverine.

===Revival by Garth Ennis===
A 12-issue miniseries by writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon, again titled &quot;The Punisher&quot; (April 2000 – March 2001), under the Marvel Knights imprint, revived the character&#x27;s popularity. An ongoing series titled &quot;The Punisher&quot; (37 issues, August 2001 – February 2004), primarily by Ennis and Dillon, followed, succeeded in 2004 by an ongoing Ennis series under Marvel&#x27;s mature-readers imprint, MAX. Ennis compared his approach to the character to the films &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;Death Wish&quot;, &quot;The Killer&quot;, and &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot;. He disavowed any serious intent to the violence of the series and argued that his only purpose was entertainment. In the course of the series, various characters attempt to emulate the Punisher&#x27;s murderous approach to justice according to their own value systems, and are themselves killed by the Punisher.

Returning the character to his lone vigilante roots, those series combined crime-focused stories with black humor. The look of the Punisher was modified further removing the white gloves and pairing his traditional skull imprinted shirt with combat trousers, black combat boots and a black trench coat. Castle has used this costume on occasion in mid-2000s stories before &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; vol. 2.

===MAX imprint===

Continuing his run on the character, Garth Ennis used the freedom of the MAX imprint to write more realistic and hard-edged stories than had previously been seen. Ennis has stated that he would &quot;like to see less superheroes&quot;; this desire is reflected in the gritty, realistic tone and the anti-heroic portrayals of both the title character and Nick Fury, who made two guest appearances in the series. &quot;Punisher&quot; also made it explicit that Castle&#x27;s timeline was fixed, while Marvel adjusted those of its other characters, with his history never altered or moved up in time. After the departure of Ennis as writer, the series was renamed &quot;Punisher: Frank Castle&quot; with issue #66.

The imprint depicts the Punisher being active for almost 30 years, with &quot;Punisher&quot; vol. 6, #19 (June 2005), specifying he had killed approximately 2,000 people. Whereas the traditional Punisher stories remained within the United States and involved antagonists and settings of conventional domestic crime, stories of the MAX Punisher often focus on current events, ranging from corporate fraud to sexual slavery and the War on Terror. Many characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the American CIA, the Soviet KGB, and the British SIS and SAS, as well as various militaries and militias from the Balkans and Middle East, including the IRA, all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the Cold War or the Yugoslav Wars.

The miniseries &quot;Born&quot; by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson further examines Castle&#x27;s roots, tracing them back to his third tour of the Vietnam War, where he undergoes a psychological and possibly supernatural transformation into the Punisher to survive a massive assault on his fortification by the combined forces of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army. The one-shot &quot;Punisher: The Tyger&quot;, by Ennis and John Severin, went even further and showed that Castle had lived with murders, deaths and criminals from his childhood.

The &quot;MAX&quot; version of the Punisher ends with the character&#x27;s death. After killing the Kingpin, Castle dies from his own wounds in issue #21 of &quot;PunisherMAX&quot;. He is buried in issue #22 as his death sparks a public uprising and killing of the city&#x27;s criminals.

===&quot;Punisher War Journal&quot; (vol. 2)===
In November 2006, a new &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; series, written by Matt Fraction and penciled by Ariel Olivetti, was released. The first three issues of the book are set during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot; event. It involves Castle taking on supervillains rather than his traditional non-super-powered criminal antagonists. He has also made appearances in the main &quot;Civil War&quot; series (issues #5–7). Wearing both his traditional costume and his Marvel Knights/MAX attire, and a new costume designed to look like his costume and Captain America&#x27;s combined, the series pitted the character against a series of super-powered foes while also being involved in crossover events such as &quot;World War Hulk&quot; and &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;.

===&quot;The Punisher&quot; and &quot;Punisher: Frank Castle&quot;===
Marvel relaunched &quot;The Punisher War Journal&quot; in 2009 as simply &quot;Punisher&quot;, with a thematic link tied to the events of the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline and, following the departure of writer Garth Ennis, retitled the Marvel MAX series (formerly &quot;Punisher MAX&quot;) as &quot;Punisher: Frank Castle MAX&quot; and, more recently, as &quot;Punisher: Frank Castle&quot; or &quot;Frank Castle: The Punisher&quot; (depending on the source); launching a new series called &quot;PunisherMAX&quot; by Jason Aaron and Steve Dillon. As part of his work on the character, Rick Remender wrote the one-shot title &quot;Dark Reign: The List – Punisher&quot;, which, as part of the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, shows the character dismembered and decapitated by Daken.

Following this, the main &quot;Punisher&quot; series was renamed &quot;FrankenCastle&quot; and featured a Castle who is resurrected by Morbius and the Legion of Monsters as a patchwork, Frankenstein-like creature. He joins up with the Legion of Monsters to help protect the monsters of Monster Metropolis from the Hunter of Monster Special Force. At the conclusion of the series, the character was transformed back into a normal human when he acquired the mystical Bloodstone, with its healing abilities restoring his humanity. Although the stone allowed him to heal from serious wounds, he ultimately chose to discard it after his monster allies helped him recognize that reliance on the stone would result in its side-effects eventually affecting his judgment, causing him to lose the ability to recognize innocents and kill people because of what they &quot;might&quot; do.

===&quot;Punisher: In the Blood&quot;===
In 2010, a Punisher series was released titled &quot;&quot;. It is a five-part series that is meant to take place after &quot;FrankenCastle&quot;. In this series, the Punisher faces Jigsaw once again.

===The Punisher (2011)===
A violent gang war resulted in the murders of nearly 30 people at a wedding reception, including the groom, leaving the bride, U.S. Marine Sergeant Rachel Cole-Alves, a widow just hours after getting married. Frank had connections with one of the detectives on the case and used the information he gave him to kill members of the Exchange, the group responsible, before the police had a chance to question them.

Later, the Punisher loses an eye while fighting a new version of the Vulture. The Punisher later confronts a recuperated Rachel Cole-Alves in a Hotel where members of the Exchange were meeting. Together they kill the members. It is later revealed to be part of a plan to lure the Punisher to 727 Varick level 19 suite A. Both Rachel Cole-Alves and the Punisher go to the location only to find it to be a trap. They later find out that Daredevil has the Omega Drive. Later Rachel Cole-Alves and the Punisher find Daredevil and Spider-Man. They then work together to destroy the drive.

The Punisher and Cole-Alves later succeed in killing the heads of the Exchange, but in the process, Cole-Alves accidentally kills NYPD Homicide Detective Walter Bolt. On the run from the NYPD, Cole-Alves eventually tries to commit suicide by police, only to be captured and sent to prison. Castle eludes capture.

Cole-Alves is sentenced to death for her crimes. Meanwhile, Spider-Man confronts Castle, but he manages to escape. Spider-Man then talks to the Avengers, stating that Castle is a problem and needs to be taken care of. Wolverine, believing that lethal methods are sometimes justified, refuses to assist. Black Widow tracks Castle to South America, where they fight to a standstill before Widow gets distracted by a group of mercenaries guarding a town full of sick villagers, abandoning the fight to help them. Thor pursues Castle next, although all he wants is to talk Castle into turning himself in.

Castle sneaks back into the US to try and break Cole-Alves out of prison. The Avengers set a trap, figuring Castle would target a transport unit. Castle sees through the deception, and rescues the real Cole-Alves by disguising himself as Iron Man. Wolverine was later revealed to be the source of his information, and Logan helps Cole-Alves escape while Castle stays behind to battle the Avengers and buy time. Castle ends up in a special underwater prison, while Cole-Alves resurfaces in Los Angeles, shooting a mugger while wearing the Skull insignia.

===Thunderbolts===
As part of the &quot;Marvel Now!&quot; event, the Punisher becomes a member of Red Hulk&#x27;s Thunderbolts. Their first mission is to take down the civilian-murdering dictator of an island nation.

===The Punisher (2014)===
As a part of All New Marvel Now, &quot;The Punisher&quot; solo series is written by Nathan Edmondson and illustrated by Mitch Gerads. The Punisher moves to Los Angeles following a drug trail, and he is being targeted by a military hit squad.

===&quot;Original Sin&quot;===
During the &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, the Punisher becomes involved in the investigation of the murder of Uatu when he is recruited by an unknown agent – later revealed to be Nick Fury – to track various deceased eldritch creatures with Doctor Strange, their combined occult and firearm knowledge allowing them to determine what killed various creatures that Fury had killed in his career as &#x27;the Man on the Wall&#x27;.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Punisher crashes the Kingpin&#x27;s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. He informs the villains present that since he cannot take them with him, he is going to have to do something with all of his bullets.

After massacring the supervillain gathering, the Punisher is approached by the Howling Commandos, who request his aid in completing one final mission before the world ends. The Punisher agrees to help, and is airlifted to Tikrit, where he works on &quot;punishing&quot; the Black Dawn, a terrorist group that had been filming themselves executing American hostages, including a former associate of the Punisher&#x27;s. The Punisher decimates the Black Dawn, and dies from gunshot wounds as the Earth is destroyed by the Incursions.

===&quot;All-New Punisher&quot; and &quot;Civil War II: Kingpin&quot;===
After Earth-616 has been restored, Frank Castle returns from the dead and comes back to New York City, to continue his personal war against criminal organizations and enterprises. His first target is a former mercenary outfit called Condor that is currently selling a drug called EMC to terrorists and gang members because it gives users enhanced confidence, perception, strength and pain tolerance. During Frank&#x27;s first bust on a Condor drug warehouse, he runs into his former Special Ops C.O. Ray Schroder (aka Olaf) who is currently working for Condor but gives Frank a folder of important intel on Condor&#x27;s EMC operation, before departing. With his new mission to take down Condor before they can get EMC into the worst hands, the Punisher is followed by a D.E.A. Agent whose drug bust on Condor was disrupted by his, as well as a sadistic killer named Face who is also second-in-command of Condor.

In the Kingpin &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Castle goes to eliminate Fisk and his criminal empire. During the fight, Castle wounds Fisk&#x27;s legs with his combat knife, and falls out of a window.

===&quot;Secret Empire&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, after Steve Rogers – his history &#x27;rewritten&#x27; by the Cosmic Cube Kobik so that he believes that he has been a Hydra sleeper agent since childhood – arranges a mass coup of America, the Punisher eventually appears targeting the former criminal Boomerang – now acting as an information broker for the underground Maria Hill – and apparently loyal to Hydra. He then reports to Steve Rogers about his mission. The Punisher later crashes Black Widow&#x27;s attempts to take down Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers. The Punisher and Black Widow continue to battle until Black Widow stabs the Punisher in the thighs. The Punisher explains Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers&#x27;s overall plan to use the Cosmic Cube is to put everything back to the way it was. Not just the Axis victory in World War II, but bringing back all of the dead as a result of Hydra like Rick Jones, Jack Flag, and Frank Castle&#x27;s family. Black Widow rejects this idea and sees Miles approaching Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers causing Black Widow to stop Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers and Miles Morales. After the real Captain America defeated his Hydra Supreme counterpart, the Punisher expresses regret for his actions in an inner monologue, calling his involvement with Hydra Supreme Rogers as probably the worst mistake of his life. He is shown atoning for his involvement with Hydra by killing every Hydra agent he can find. Upon the Punisher blowing up the abandoned warehouse where some Hydra agents were hiding, he is being observed by Nick Fury Jr. who speaks over the comms that the Punisher is ready.

=== Marvel Legacy and Fresh Start ===
Some time after the events of &quot;Secret Empire&quot;, Nick Fury Jr. gives The Punisher access to the War Machine armor in order to combat a rogue state using old S.H.I.E.L.D. resources. During the aftermath of the operation, Frank resumes his war on crime in New York with the War Machine armor, only to surrender it after James Rhodes was revived. Despite wanting to atone for his sins for unknowingly working for Hydra, combined with the death of Natasha at the hands of a Hydra Supreme counterpart of Steve Rogers, the Punisher is still a fugitive, having gone too far in hunting the remaining Hydra remnants on his brutal crime fighting spree. After surrendering the War Machine Armor out of respect of the revived Rhodes, the Punisher surrenders to the authorities but was secretly freed by the Winter Soldier and a recently revived Natasha (the latter, now in a cloned body).

The comic was relaunched in 2018, by writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Riccardo Burchielli. The story ditched the War Machine armor, but kept the idea of the Punisher operating at the international level, dealing with an ill-fated battle against Baron Zemo.

=== Punisher No More ===
A new 13 issue series began in 2022 with Jason Aaron serving as the writer and art from Jesús Saiz and Paul Azaceta. It showcases Castle serving as an assassin of the ninja organization The Hand.

=== Punisher (2023) ===
Following the conclusion of the previous series, a new Punisher volume began publication in November 2023, written by David Pepose, illustrated by Dave Wachter, with covers by Rod Reis. The series follows Joe Garrison, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who becomes the new Punisher following Frank Castle&#x27;s disappearance. This ongoing series was cancelled after only 4 issues.

==Characterization==

===Fictional character biography===
Frank Castiglione was born in Queens, New York City, although his family Anglicized their name to Castle after his birth. He studied for the priesthood, but quit because of his inability to forgive major sins. He enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in a foreign war, where he spent three tours of duty and distinguished himself in combat. He received the nickname &quot;Punisher&quot; in military service. He married a woman named Maria. They had two children. While on leave, Castle and his family witnessed a mob hit on an informant, in Central Park. In response, the criminals attempted to murder the entire family; while his family was lost, Castle survived. While he identified the murderers, the police did not prosecute because the killers had paid for alibis. As a result, Castle took justice into his own hands and killed all of the perpetrators. He then decided that all criminals were indirectly responsible for his loss.

The Punisher&#x27;s backstory initially introduced him as a veteran of the Vietnam War. In this capacity, he appeared in the comic book &quot;The &#x27;Nam&quot;, about the conflict. However, this dated the character as the years passed and the war was increasingly in the past. Greg Rucka retconned it to the War on Terror, instead, in 2011. He explained:

He also clarified that the retcon was only for the character in the main Marvel universe and not for the version in the MAX Comics, that retained the first origin. The conflict was retconned again in 2019, in &quot;History of the Marvel Universe&quot; #2, to the fictional Siancong War.

===Personality and motivation===
The character has been described as being obsessed with vengeance; Garth Ennis noted that the character of the Punisher &quot;sees the world in very black and white terms, he solves his problems with utter finality&quot; and that &quot;his response to any problem: when in doubt, hit back hard.&quot; The writer Steven Grant noted that:

Punisher co-creator Gerry Conway stated that &quot;He&#x27;s a great Rorschach test. What&#x27;s given him some sustainability is, you can put into him whatever you want, as opposed to Spider-Man, who truly is who he is and shouldn&#x27;t be changed. The Punisher is a thin character on his own merits, but that allows for a lot of interpretations and different angles of approach.&quot;

==Skills, weapons, and abilities==
The Punisher is the recipient of intense infantry training from the United States Marine Corps and special operations training by Force Recon. He went through Airborne School, Ranger School, BUDs, the Q-Course, and SERE; as well as cross-training with the Australian SASR during the Vietnam War. From this training, the Punisher is proficient in not only basic infantry and special operations skills, but the use and maintenance of specialized firearms, equipment, and explosive ordnance. He is highly trained in infiltration into heavily guarded enemy territories and structures for the purpose of assassination, capture, and military intelligence. As a Scout/Sniper he is highly trained in various forms of camouflage and stealth in different environments. He is also highly proficient at hand-to-hand combat, and has been trained in multiple forms of martial arts such as Chin Na, Hwa Rang Do, Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Nash Ryu Jujutsu, Ninjutsu, Shōrin-ryū Karate and Systema. He refuses to take painkillers, as he feels that their benefit of dulling pain is not worth the side effects of drowsiness and slowed reflexes.

He maintains multiple safehouses and vehicles around the greater New York City area as well as multiple forged identities and bank accounts (most of the funds and equipment aiding him in his work being taken from the criminals he hunts). The Punisher has a Kevlar uniform which protects him from most gunfire, though he can still suffer concussive injury or penetration from sufficient or repeated impacts. The white skull emblem on his chest is used both to intimidate his enemies and to lure their fire to the more heavily protected area of his armor. The design was supposedly taken from either a Vietcong sniper, or the demon Olivier. The Punisher uses a large variety of firearms in his war on crime; including fully automatic rifles, shotguns, flame throwers, or whatever he can get his hands on. Though he has a preference for guns, the Punisher has been using technology derived from super-villains and other costumed characters, such as the Green Goblin&#x27;s pumpkin bombs, a modified Goblin Glider, and a Doctor Octopus tentacle that he can shrink down for easy storage via Pym Particles. For a time after the absence of Jim &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes because of Thanos, the Punisher would be offered the War Machine armor by Nick Fury, Jr. to apprehend a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. cell.

Aside from his physical prowess, the Punisher demonstrates superb intensive focus and mental discipline, providing a strong resistance against psychic and telepathic powers that are used against him. When Letha and Lascivious try to manipulate his aggression, for example, he scoffs at their attempt, saying, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t feel different from any other day&quot;.

==Supporting characters==
Despite wanting to work alone, the Punisher has a few supporting characters to help fight crime. Microchip assisted Castle by building and supplying weapons and technology and providing friendship. During the &quot;Civil War&quot;, he was aided by Stuart Clarke for a short time. Various police officers and detectives have assisted the Punisher, most notably Lynn Michaels and Lt. Martin Soap. Lynn Michaels was a police officer who teamed up with Castle to take down a serial rapist and later quit the force to become a vigilante. Martin Soap was secretly allied with the Punisher and gave him information on his targets from the police database.

==In politics and popular culture==
=== Australia ===
====Military personnel====
Australian Special Forces units operating in Iraq and Afghanistan are known to wear Punisher iconography. 2nd Commando Regiment and SASR members have been photographed on patrol wearing &#x27;death symbols&#x27; including the Punisher logo, Spartan helmets and skulls. This led to a ban by Chief of the Defence Force Angus Campbell beginning in 2017 and included flags, patches and stencilled logos. Significant pushback from the Veteran Community regarding the ban was received; however, as of 2022 Australian Defence Force standing orders continue to enforce the ban.

=== United States ===
====Military personnel====

The Punisher&#x27;s skull first became noticeably visible as a symbol during the Iraq War by US military personnel. Service members would use the skull as an unofficial service patch or paint it on equipment. This was most notably done by Navy SEALs of SEAL Team 3 during the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. Chris Kyle popularized the usage in his autobiography, later filmed as &quot;American Sniper&quot;: &quot;We spray-painted it on our Hummers and body armor, and our helmets and all our guns. We spray-painted it on every building or wall we could, We wanted people to know, We&#x27;re here and we want to fuck with you.&quot;

====Militia groups====
In addition to being used by the United States military and police, the Punisher&#x27;s skull emblem is used by anti-government militias, such as the 3 Percenters (a group dating back to 2008), and the symbol was seen at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.

====Law enforcement====
Since 2015, the skull emblem became popular within police officers&#x27; Blue Lives Matter movement, with many companies producing decals, stickers, and T-shirts featuring the Punisher emblem colored with the thin blue line, or atop an American flag. In 2017, the Catlettsburg Police department in Kentucky faced a public backlash after installing large decals with the Punisher&#x27;s skull and &quot;Blue Lives Matter&quot; on the hoods of police cars, and removed the decals in response to public pressure. Citizens and police interpreted its meaning differently; the police chief said, &quot;We&#x27;re getting so many calls, and they&#x27;re saying that the Punisher logo (means) we&#x27;re out to kill people, and that&#x27;s not the meaning behind that. That didn&#x27;t cross my mind.&quot;

====Firefighters====
A variation of the Punisher&#x27;s skull has been used by EMS/Firefighters. The skull is similar to the police version but the blue line is replaced with a red line.

====Reaction====

Punisher co-creator Gerry Conway has decried the use of the Punisher symbol by law enforcement, saying, &quot;To me, it&#x27;s disturbing whenever I see authority figures embracing Punisher iconography because the Punisher represents a failure of the Justice system. ... The vigilante anti-hero is fundamentally a critique of the justice system, an example of social failure, so when cops put the Punisher&#x27;s skulls on their cars or members of the military wear Punisher&#x27;s skull patches, they&#x27;re basically siding with an enemy of the system.&quot; Conway compared it to &quot;putting a Confederate flag on a government building.&quot; After members of the Detroit Police Department were seen wearing the Punisher skull during the George Floyd protests in 2020, Conway and others called on Marvel and its parent company Disney to take legal action to prevent law enforcement from using the logo.

This controversy was addressed in &quot;Punisher&quot; Vol. 12 #13 written by Matthew Rosenberg in July 2019. In the issue, Frank comes across two police officers who are fans of his. They take a selfie with him and show they have a sticker of his logo on their car before comparing their work to his. Unimpressed, the Punisher tears up the sticker and tells them, &quot;I&#x27;ll say this once, we&#x27;re not the same. You took an oath to uphold the law. You help people. I gave that up a long time ago. You don&#x27;t do what I do. Nobody does. You boys need a role model? His name&#x27;s Captain America, and he&#x27;d be happy to have you... If I find out you are trying to do what I do, I&#x27;ll come for you next.&quot; In 2020, Marvel said this was their official opinion on the use of the image.

=== Iraq ===
From the early 2000s, the Punisher rapidly gained popularity in Iraq. By 2015, his logo had become widely used by the Iraqi Armed Forces and Iraqi paramilitary groups. According to researcher Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, many Iraqis thought that the logo was &quot;cool&quot; despite widespread anti-Americanism.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
David Harth of &quot;CBR.com&quot; referred to the Punisher as one of the &quot;best anti-heroes in Marvel Comics&quot;, saying, &quot;The Punisher made his debut fighting Spider-Man but would go on to much bigger and better things. Gaining insane popularity in the &#x27;80s, the Punisher&#x27;s logo is one of the most recognizable in all comics. Even non-fans know his deal – Frank Castle fights a never-ending battle against crime, trying to avenge his family&#x27;s death by killing as many bad people as he can. Just a regular guy with a lot of training and ordinance, the Punisher is still one of the most formidable vigilantes in the Marvel Universe, even able to smack around superpowered heroes. The Punisher wasn&#x27;t the first gun-toting vigilante, but he would redefine that type of character for a new era.&quot;

Darby Harn of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called the Punisher one of the &quot;best antiheroes in Marvel Comics&quot;, writing, &quot;The Punisher takes the antihero concept much farther than Wolverine. Wolverine obeys a strict code, which Frank Castle ostensibly does, but the results differ greatly. Frank Castle hunts down and murders criminals with extreme prejudice, operating outside the law and caring very little for the consequences. Though his actions stem from a need for justice for his murdered family, his violent behavior echoes that of the people he hunts so much that the distinctions are negligible.&quot;

Noel Murray of &quot;Inverse&quot; described the Punisher as one of the &quot;greatest antiheroes of all time&quot;, asserting, &quot;Though the character debuted in a Spider-Man comic in 1974, the Punisher became a phenomenon in the late &#x27;80s, when his no-quarter-given approach to crime-fighting synched up with the tough talk of the Reagan era. Later takes on the character have restored some moral ambiguity to an antihero whose militancy makes him a fascinating case study in what we&#x27;re willing to accept in exchange for security.&quot;

&quot;Empire&quot; named the Punisher one of the &quot;greatest comic-book characters&quot;, stating, &quot;The Punisher is now one of the most iconic characters in the entire Marvel stable. A &#x27;Nam vet driven by his family&#x27;s murder to punish all criminals by death, it&#x27;s perhaps not unsurprising that the dark, disillusioned &#x27;70s was the decade that saw a brutal, uncompromising psychopath (for that&#x27;s what Castle is, no debate) become a fan favourite. Although, truth be told, operating within the confines of the toothless main Marvel titles never sat well with The Punisher – in recent years, with the move to the MAX label, and Garth Ennis&#x27; soon-to-finish installation as Punisher guru, the dark heart and psychology of Frank Castle has been fully explored, giving a new insight into this grimmest and most compelling of characters.&quot;

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2004 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 20th best selling comic book in January 2004. &quot;Punisher&quot; #2 was the 24th best selling comic book in January 2004.

Joey Esposito of &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the &quot;Punisher&quot; comic book series 15th in their &quot;25 Best Comic Runs of the Decade&quot; list, writing, &quot;The run of Garth Ennis on Punisher stems back beyond our ten year timeline, including a 12-issue series that featured the celebrated story, &quot;Welcome Back, Frank.&quot; But after that, Ennis rejuvenated the character most notably under Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint, which allowed not only for extreme violence and language (which suits Frank&#x27;s world more than most Marvel heroes), but for the real-time aging of the character.&quot; Jared Gaudreau of &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked the &quot;Punisher&quot; comic book series 7th in their &quot;10 Best Punisher Comics&quot; list, saying, &quot;In 2004, one of the most iconic and influential comic runs of all time started with Garth Ennis&#x27; &quot;Punisher MAX&quot;. Serving as Volume 7 of the ongoing &quot;Punisher&quot; title, &quot;Punisher MAX&quot; is famous for its consistent depiction of Frank Castle as a vigilante and anti-hero. In &quot;Punisher MAX&quot; issues 30-36, Punisher is pitted against Barracuda, a mercenary with an extensive history in the US military. Facing off a number of times throughout the six-issue arc, it&#x27;s made very apparent that Barracuda is not an everyday mercenary and is more than capable of matching Frank&#x27;s brutality.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2009 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 33rd best selling comic book in January 2009. &quot;Punisher&quot; #2 was the 39th best selling comic book in February 2009.

Dan Phillips of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a grade of 7 out of 10, asserting, &quot;Because the main feature of the series is so simple and fast-moving, there&#x27;s not much else to say about this issue other than I found it entertaining. Remender kept me at the edge of my seat, and artist Jerome Opena did a good job capturing the energy of this chase, even if his work is a little too rough around the edges in places. All in all, I&#x27;d say the premise of Punisher trying to kill Norman Osborn is an interesting one; I just don&#x27;t know how long they&#x27;ll be able to milk it without convincing fans that Norman could actually die in a Punisher comic.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2011 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 25th best selling comic book in August 2011. &quot;Punisher&quot; #2 was the 30th best selling comic book in August 2011.

Ryan K. Lindsay of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a &quot;face-stomping crime comic&quot;, stating, &quot;With a new #1, &quot;The Punisher&quot; relaunch under the &#x27;Big Shots&#x27; banner is going to be a treat. It reads well, it looks just as good, and will appeal to a broad audience. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see over subsequent issues how Rucka&#x27;s vision for this character plays out. This issue delivers a ballet of blood that kick starts a myth of a man of death. You could almost call this &#x27;The Ballad of Frank Castle&#x27; and you&#x27;d have the tone nailed down.&quot; Erik Norris of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;For those anticipating Frank Castle&#x27;s return to a solo series in the main Marvel Universe, &quot;The Punisher&quot; #1 should satisfy. The book introduces new, interesting characters to the ensemble cast, shows Frank Castle doing what he does best, and maybe most exciting of all, doesn&#x27;t tiptoe around the violent world that Frank Castle has succumbed to being a part of. If only Checchetto&#x27;s art was more consistent, then we would have a do-not-miss slam dunk. But even so, &quot;The Punisher&quot; #1 still comes highly recommended. Welcome back, Frank.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2014 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 18th best selling comic book in February 2014.

Benjamin Bailey of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a grade of 7.5 out of 10, asserting, &quot;As a huge fan of the character, I&#x27;m just excited to have the Punisher back in a series all his own with a solid creative team telling his tales. It&#x27;s only the first issue, but there&#x27;s enough promise here to warrant a commitment from fans of the skull-wearing vigilante. Here&#x27;s hoping for a long run, filled with bullets, blood, and action. That&#x27;s all we really want and need out of a Punisher series. The Punisher brings our favorite skull-wearing vigilante back into the spotlight in a storm of bullets, violence and death. There&#x27;s nothing new here, but any time Frank comes back is a good time indeed. Glad to have you back, Mr. Castle.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2016 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 3rd best selling comic book in May 2016.

Bob Franco of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; called Punisher #1 a &quot;must read&quot;, writing, &quot;As a first installment, this issue sets The Punisher off to a good start. There&#x27;s not a lot of explanation, but there doesn&#x27;t need to be yet. It&#x27;s reminiscent of the circumstances Frank surges through in the Netflix DAREDEVIL series, though Frank is mute through this first issue: not a word spoken, nor a thought given. Everything we know has been told to us, so there&#x27;s real intrigue to see how this series progresses. It&#x27;s a book that gives little character examination but makes one pine for more.&quot; Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a grade of 8.2 out of 10, saying, &quot;Frank Castle is in fine form after taking a few months away from the spotlight. This new series doesn&#x27;t do anything dramatically different with the franchise (not yet, at least), but it does feature a hands-off approach to the lead character and introduce some intriguing new villains to the mix. The series also proves that Steve Dillon isn&#x27;t simply content to rest on his laurels after so many Punisher projects. This is a solid start to what may become a very memorable Punisher run.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2018 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 11th best selling comic book in August 2018. &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 121st best selling comic book in 2018.

Jenna Anderson of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;There&#x27;s an interesting dichotomy within &quot;The Punisher&quot; #1—as things are getting smaller and more back to basics for Frank, the consequences of his actions seem to be getting larger and larger. Considering the ways the character has been interpreted over the years, that choice is a complex, but decidedly powerful one, which could bode well for the series as it continues to go on. It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess as to how this all will resolve for Frank, or what kind of man he will be when his chickens come to roost. But there&#x27;s enough within this new-ish iteration of The Punisher to make fans eager to follow along for the ride.&quot; Joshua Davison of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Punisher #1&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly the stripped-down Frank Castle story I think many were expecting after the War Machine story, but it is Frank going back to his old methods of urban guerrilla warfare with the occasional frigging tank mixed in for good measure. It&#x27;s not exactly smart or profound, but it is a fun read with great artwork and worth a recommendation. Check this one out.&quot;

==== &quot;Punisher&quot; - 2022 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 was the 15th best selling comic book in March 2022.

Hannah Rose of &quot;CBR.com&quot; called &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 a &quot;gory yet stunning premiere&quot;, asserting, &quot;The Punisher himself has gotten a makeover beyond his sleek new outfit and updated logo, fresh for his cultish recruitment. He appears more fresh-faced than in previous recent incarnations, even romantic at moments. Considering that &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 is something of a fresh start for the character and his continuity, this new look is fitting. &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 is a major departure for Frank Castle, but this opens his character up to whole new explorations. What happens when the Punisher gets everything he wants? &quot;Punisher&quot; #1 gives the audience a few ideas and plenty of material for the next issue to work with.&quot;

==Other versions==
===Punisher 2099===
====First version====

The Marvel 2099 universe follows the story of Public Eye police officer, Jake Gallows, after the murder of his mother, brother and sister-in-law. Gallows comes across Frank Castle&#x27;s war journal in the Public Eye archives, and took the mantle as the new Punisher. At first he follows Frank&#x27;s old code of justice, only killing those who hurt the innocent. He later loses his mind, at one point proposing murdering two people simply because they were having sex with each other. He is later named Minister of Punishment in Doctor Doom&#x27;s 2099 government. He is joined by Polly, a lab-bred humanoid who becomes his partner.

====Marvel Knights version====
Marvel Knights&#x27; &quot;Punisher 2099&quot;, another take on the year 2099, featured Cassondra Castle who goes by the alias of Cossandra Natchios. She is the daughter of Frank Castle and Elektra Natchios and has a son named Franklin. When she is diagnosed with cancer, Cossandra sets out to teach her son everything he needs to know to become the next Punisher. Upon her death, Franklin chooses not to take over, allowing the Punisher title to end with his mother.

===Amalgam Comics===
In &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot;, the Punisher is merged with Steve Trevor to make Trevor Castle. In this continuity Trevor Castle lost his family when they were caught in a gang war, which led him to become the Punisher and eventually marry Diana Prince, with whom he had a son named Ryan before they separated. In &quot;Bullets and Bracelets&quot;, Ryan is kidnapped which leads to Trevor and Diana to work together to figure out who is responsible. Their search leads them to Thanoseid, who apparently kills their son. Trevor was about to kill Thanoseid&#x27;s personal assassin Kanto, but was stopped by Diana who figured out Kanto was actually Ryan.

Wanting revenge on Trevor for indirectly causing the death of his own son, Thanoseid sent Ryan back in time to become Kanto so that either Trevor will kill his son or Kanto would kill his father. With his plan foiled, he sent Trevor and Diana back to Earth, with the two deciding to give their relationship another chance.

===Frank Castle===
Alternative versions of the Punisher have appeared for over three decades. The earliest examples of those alternative versions can be found within the monthly &quot;What If&quot; series. Using existing Marvel stories as a starting point, the series examined scenarios in which, for example, Frank Castle&#x27;s family has not died or he had killed Daredevil in their first encounter. Other &quot;What If&quot; stories looked at his adventures as a new Captain America or as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Garth Ennis wrote a one-off special entitled &quot;Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe&quot; where Frank Castle kills every superhero and supervillain in the Marvel Universe after his family are caught in the crossfire of a battle with the Brood.

The Punisher also featured in a number of more extended looks at alternative universes and lives such as the Age of Apocalypse&#x27;s Frank Castle (as a man who fled genocide to become a monk).

===House of M===
In the alternative universe &quot;House of M&quot;, Castle appears as a media vigilante nicknamed the &quot;Punisher&quot; and is recruited after his arrest by John Proudstar to join and be the other human in the strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.

===A Man Named Frank===
&quot;The Punisher: A Man Named Frank&quot;, written by Chuck Dixon, was a western themed take on the character. Castle is a cowboy during the time of the American Old West who is out for revenge to the criminals who killed his family.

===Marvel Noir===
In &quot;The Punisher Noir&quot;, Frank Castelione is a veteran of World War I who has a winged version of a skull tattooed on his chest. His wife died from cancer and Castelione is killed by Jigsaw, Barracuda and the Russian after a fight. His only son is the Punisher, patterning himself after a radio pulp series. This version of the Punisher wears a mask emblazoned with his trademark skull (similar to Crossbones) which is later carved into his chest by Jigsaw. The Punisher fights against a criminal conspiracy controlling the entire city, and kills Barracuda by ripping him in half.

===Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness===
In the universe of &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; and &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness&quot;, Frank takes advantage of the fact that the heroes and law enforcement officers are busy with zombies and he hunts and shoots down the super-villain leadership of New York City, known as the Kingpin, The Owl, and Hammerhead. Along the way, he allies himself with Ash Williams, who he intends to help battle the zombie threat. When Ash sees him kill the still human criminal trio he becomes disgusted and mistakenly abandons the Punisher minutes later. This leaves Frank to be attacked and infected by a squad of zombies, causing him to at first be &quot;killed&quot;. Frank returns as a zombie and turns Ash&#x27;s ally, the Scarlet Witch into one. The Punisher appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution&quot;, where he appears zombified along with other zombies attacking the Marvel Apes.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the alternative universe &quot;Marvel Mangaverse&quot; continuity, Sosumi Brown is Tokyo&#x27;s Punisher, who fights the crime family of Skang Kee Ho. That family uses an Oni (Japanese demon) named Oni Yew to try to stop her, but her sister, Hashi Brown, finds out about her secret. In the process, she obtains a cursed weapon which she uses to slay the Oni and save her sister.

===MC2===
In the alternative-future universe of &quot;MC2&quot;, the Punisher is still active, but has moved to South America to deal with the level of drug runners there. He returns to New York after hearing of a gang war between Black Tarantula and a Maggia don called Silverback, whom he had once crippled, but now has cybernetic implants. He eventually dies in a final confrontation with Silverback.

===Old Man Logan===
In the possible future timeline depicted in the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline that takes place on Earth-21923, the Punisher shows up to help fight the villains during the days the villains rose to power. He shot Electro before he was stabbed in the chest during a sneak attack from Kraven the Hunter. He survived the attack and resumed his war on crime, killing Nuke and other criminals. 50 years later, the Punisher finds that a gang calling themselves the &quot;Punishers&quot; has been tarnishing his reputation by killing men and kidnapping children in light of the Hulk Gang having most of its members killed. In addition, the Punisher is shown to have a failing memory as the Punishers have stolen his war journal. This causes the Punisher to assist Old Man Logan in attacking the stronghold of the Punishers to save the kidnapped children. Fighting the Punishers&#x27; leader, Panhead, he is fatally injured. When Panhead is killed, the Punisher reclaims his war journal and looks at the picture of his late family as he peacefully dies.

On Earth-807128, a new Kingpin captures two men who have taken up the mantles of the Punisher and Daredevil after they along with Ashley Barton / Spider-Bitch apparently tried to destroy his empire. Chained to posts in a stadium and in full view of a crowd, the new Punisher and Daredevil are gruesomely dispatched by carnivorous dinosaurs as they ask after the imprisoned Ashley. After being freed by her father, Ashley kills Kingpin before attempting to kill her father, revealing that she and the new Daredevil and Punisher had actually sought to take over the former Kingpin&#x27;s empire themselves, with Ashley becoming the new Kingpin of the Wastelands.

===Ruins===
In the reality of &quot;Marvel Ruins&quot;, following his interview with Rick Jones at his apartment in Chicago, Phil Sheldon trips over the corpse of the Punisher in the snowfall.

===Venomverse===
In the reality of &quot;Venomverse: War Stories&quot;, Frank Castle led a war on crime for years, until the Kingpin organized the crime families of New York against him, Frank found himself hunted by the criminal underworld. Growing desperate, Frank made a deal with the Venom Symbiote, the symbiote would allow him to kill Fisk and &#x27;win&#x27; his war on crime, on the condition that Frank would kill one target for the symbiote. This target was revealed to be Spider-Man, an innocent, and Frank tried to resist the symbiote as it formed a rifle in his hands. Fortunately for Frank, a Venomized Doctor Strange chose that moment to transport them into a war between Venoms and Poisons, inadvertently saving Spider-Man&#x27;s life. He was unfortunately assimilated by a Poison along with his symbiote, thus creating Poison Punisher.

Later he was present in the Hive&#x27;s invasion of the Prime Marvel Universe and was able to bond Spider-Man to a symbiote. He continued to face off against that universe&#x27;s heroes, also successfully bonding Devil Dinosaur to a symbiote, but was soon killed when Agent Anti-Venom arrived and attempted to free him from the Poison, only to find he was hollow, having been already consumed by the Poison.

===Cosmic Ghost Rider===

In the alternate reality of &quot;Thanos&quot;, where Thanos conquered all the Universe, Frank Castle&#x27;s early life was seemingly similar to that of the Frank Castle of the Earth-616 Universe. However, when Thanos came to Earth, the Punisher was one of the last casualties during the last stand of the heroes and his soul was subsequently sent to Hell. Willing to give anything in order to punish Thanos for slaughtering his planet, the Punisher signed a demonic deal with Mephisto and became the Ghost Rider. When he returned to Earth, however, Thanos was already gone and everything on the planet was dead. Roaming endlessly and undying with no one to kill or love, the Ghost Rider spent the next countless years alone. He eventually began to lose his mind when even Mephisto fell silent to his calls. When a badly injured Galactus arrived on Earth seeking help against Thanos, unaware that the population of Earth had already been killed by him, the Ghost Rider offered the dead planet to him in exchange for the chance of punishing the Mad Titan as his herald which the Great Devourer accepted. Bestowed with the Power Cosmic, Frank Castle became Cosmic Ghost Rider.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The alternative universe &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; version of Punisher is Frank Castle, an ex-NYPD police officer whose family was killed by corrupt police officers who knew he was going to expose them. He manages to kill the one responsible for his family&#x27;s death after sympathetic cops &quot;accidentally&quot; place him as the man&#x27;s cellmate. After he unsuccessfully tried to kill Boomerang, he later kills corrupt cop Jeanne De Wolfe. In &quot;Ultimate Comics: Avengers 2&quot;, the Punisher is defeated and arrested by Captain America. He is saved from the death penalty by Nick Fury orchestrating his release from custody in exchange for joining the Avengers. After being equipped with a Captain America-inspired costume, he is implanted with a chip that delivers a violent electric shock whenever he disobeys orders. Being knocked out by Hawkeye, it allowed him to escape after the fight between the two Ghost Riders.

In &quot;Ultimate Avengers vs New Ultimates&quot;, he was incarcerated after assassinating the Russian criminal known as the Red Hammer and is later visited by Fury persuading him to rejoin the Avengers by offering him revenge on his fellow prisoners. While the Avengers were battling the New Ultimates, the Punisher was aiming a sniper rifle at Captain America&#x27;s kneecap with the intention of immobilization. However, Spider-Man swung in and took the hit from the Punisher&#x27;s bullet instead. Horrified that he had shot a kid, he begged the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that arrived shortly afterwards to &quot;punish him&quot;. After the Punisher and the Avengers were arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D., they took Tyrone Cash&#x27;s serum and temporarily gained Hulk-like powers. They confronted the new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Gregory Stark, but are easily defeated thanks to Stark&#x27;s Nanite-based suit. The Avengers later assisted the New Ultimates against Stark&#x27;s Spider in Korea. In the conflict&#x27;s aftermath, the Punisher is last seen torturing the other convicts in prison.

===What If===
*In &quot;What If...the Punisher&#x27;s Family Had Not Been Killed in Central Park?&quot;, Castle&#x27;s family does not die in the park and he joins the police force following his discharge from the Marine Corps. However, Frank tries to collect evidence on corrupt cops, but they attack Frank&#x27;s house in the middle of the night, killing Frank&#x27;s family and his brother-in-law. Castle returns to kill those who murdered his family, making Frank become the Punisher after all. However, a major divergence from his mainstream version&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; includes providing proof of his targets&#x27; wrongdoing to the press.
*In &quot;What If The Punisher Had Killed Spider-Man?&quot;, an alternative version of the events depicted in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #129, the Jackal successfully dupes the Punisher into killing Spider-Man and abandons him to take the fall in his place. Becoming a hunted fugitive, the Punisher eventually tracks Warren down and intends to surrender him to the police. But when the NYPD is about to arrest him instead, threatening to kill him should he shoot Warren, Warren is executed (off-panel) by the Punisher after the latter gleefully concludes the story with the words: &quot;See you on the other side, Jackal.&quot;.
*In &quot;What If&quot;, Captain America is seriously injured in a fight with the Red Skull (an alternative ending of &quot;Captain America&quot; #212) and converted into a cyborg, which drives him to bestow his uniform upon another candidate. Castle is eventually chosen, and although he first pursues his family&#x27;s killers in his usual alter ego, after a talk with the recovered Steve Rogers and some soul-searching he becomes a new and worthy Captain America.
*In &quot;What If&quot;, Frank is possessed by Venom instead of Eddie Brock. With the Punisher as Venom, he goes on a rampage killing several villains including Tombstone and the Kingpin. He eventually confronts the symbiote and they work together.
*In &quot;What If...Wolverine Had Become the Lord of Vampires?&quot;, Frank is chosen by the spirit of Doctor Strange to fight the vampires. Frank does so by killing Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm, and Juggernaut, all of whom became vampires. When Frank fights Wolverine, he accidentally kills Kitty Pryde, causing Wolverine to kill him.
*In &quot;What If&quot; features Wolverine becoming the Punisher during the 1920s.
*In &quot;What If... Peter Parker Became the Punisher?&quot;, Peter Parker&#x27;s history echoes his 616 counterpart, but he becomes a vigilante that kills people with specialized bullets using a wrist chaingun attached to his webshooters. His costume is a mixture of Spider-Man and the Punisher. After killing the Sinister Six and the Green Goblin, he ultimately retires the Punisher persona to avoid putting his loved ones in danger. However, this results in a local crime organization killing Frank Castle&#x27;s family. While escaping the scene, Frank stumbles upon Peter&#x27;s costume in the trash, suggesting he will become the next Punisher.

===Age of X===
In the X-Men crossover &quot;Age of X&quot;, another universe&#x27;s General Frank Castle commands a mutant-hunting version of the Avengers.

===Marvel Universe vs The Punisher===
In this alternate universe, an unknown pathogen transforms the entire superhuman population, as well as basic civilians, into zombie-like cannibals. Five years prior, the Punisher raided a Mafia deal in a warehouse, incidentally releasing the plague. Due to being overly exposed to the pathogen, he has gained a special immunity from the virus. He is one of the few people immune to the pathogen, the others being Hawkeye and Wolverine.

During the beginning days of the outbreak, Wolverine sought out Frank after getting a tip from Reed Richards that someone with Frank&#x27;s M.O. was present when the virus was released. When confronted, Frank recounted the events which occurred eighteen months prior to when the virus was released, revealing that all it did was make him sick for a few weeks. Richards, overhearing their conversation via radio, determines that Frank&#x27;s overexposure to the pathogen has given him a special immunity and that he is humanity&#x27;s best chance at getting a cure. After fighting to the Baxter Building, both men find that the building&#x27;s emergency generator has stopped working and the security team has been slaughtered. Upon further investigation, they find a badly injured Reed, who tells them that both the Thing and Beast have turned with the latter feasting upon Hank Pym.

Later, following a failed counterattack against a large cannibal army led by an infected Hulk, the Punisher, Deadpool, and Captain America save a badly injured Wolverine, who lost his arm in the battle. The four later coordinate two diversions while Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther lead a convoy of scientists out of the city so they could begin work on a cure in a safe location. Frank and Captain America launch an offensive against a large cannibal horde, though Captain America begins to succumb to the plague and begs Frank to kill him before he turns. A solemn Frank obliges and is soon confronted by Hawkeye, who witnessed the execution.

Weeks later, Frank continues to fight the horde alongside other uninfected heroes. He is one of few heroes who do not accept Dr. Doom&#x27;s offer of wearing a Doom Stone to prevent the infection. Frank, Hawkeye, and Black Widow end up being the last uninfected heroes in New York after the surviving heroes are forcibly turned by Doctor Doom using Doom Stones to accelerate the turning process. Though they attempt to save their fellow heroes, their attempts are in vain and Black Widow is kidnapped by Spider-Man, while Frank leaves Hawkeye and goes out in search of him. Frank later witnesses Hawkeye&#x27;s murder at the hands of Thor, leaving him as the last uninfected person in New York.

Five years later, the Punisher hunts for the first known infected, Spider-Man in a New York City that has been depopulated. Castle is constantly bugged by a cannibalistic Deadpool, who he has killed over 35 times. While out on patrol, Frank encounters an elderly priest and a young boy who have been surviving in the ruins of New York. While the Priest attempts to appeal to Frank&#x27;s humanity in hopes that the infected can be saved, Frank coldly tells him that the only way to win is to kill them all.

They are soon confronted by Spider-Man, who offers Frank and the remaining human survivors safe passage out of the city in exchange for returning his wife to him from Kingpin. The Punisher rescued a pregnant Mary Jane Parker from the hands of a flesh-eating Kingpin and his cohorts. At the end, Mary Jane looks on aghast as Castle kills Spider-Man and sends off the survivors. The Punisher stays behind on Manhattan to continue his hunt for cannibals.

===Spider-Gwen===
In this alternate universe of &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, Captain Frank Castle of the NYPD is called in to take over for George Stacy in the hunt for Spider-Woman. He was a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and the Second Gulf War, where he and Maria Walls were the only survivors of a massive firefight. The two later marry and have 2 children. He then worked as a mercenary for Tony Stark&#x27;s private military company, WAR MACHINE. After that stint, he joins the NYPD, rapidly rising through the ranks. On the day he was named to take over the Spider-Woman case, he finds a note that Maria and the children have left him, and Frank finds himself now only focusing on his job.

After following the Vulture on an attack on George Stacy, Castle takes on both the Vulture and Spider-Woman, the latter of whom brutally beats Castle, though Castle does see her unmasked face, he is unaware of her actual identity; Castle subsequently takes on the forces of the Hand, and the Kingpin, Matt Murdock.

<doc id="311855" wikidata="Q17004417" url="?curid=311855" title="Autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft)">
<text>For fixed-wing aircraft, autorotation is the tendency of an aircraft in or near a stall to roll spontaneously to the right or left, leading to a spin (a state of continuous autorotation).

==Details==
When the angle of attack is less than the stalling angle, any increase in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle of attack and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the angle of attack and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle of attack. For this reason the angle of attack is stable when it is less than the stalling angle. The aircraft displays damping in roll.

When the wing is stalled and the angle of attack is greater than the stalling angle, any increase in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends the angle of attack increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle of attack to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle of attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason the angle of attack is unstable when it is greater than the stalling angle. Any disturbance of the angle of attack on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously. 

When the angle of attack on the wing of an aircraft reaches the stalling angle the aircraft is at risk of autorotation. This will eventually develop into a spin if the pilot does not take corrective action.

== Autorotation in kites and gliders ==
# Magnus effect rotating kites (wing flipping or wing tumbling) that have the rotation axis bluntly normal to the stream direction use autorotation; a net lift is possible that lifts the kite and payload to altitude. The Rotoplane, the UFO rotating kite, and the Skybow rotating ribbon arch kite use the Magnus effect resulting from the autorotating wing with rotation axis normal to the stream.
# Some kites are equipped with autorotation wings. 
# Again, a third kind of autorotation occurs in self-rotating bols, rotating parachutes, or rotating helical objects sometimes used as kite tails or kite-line laundry. This kind of autorotation drives wind and water propeller-type turbines, sometimes used to generate electricity.
# Unlocked engine-off aircraft propellers may autorotate. Such autorotation is being explored for generating electricity to recharge flight-driving batteries.

<doc id="311862" wikidata="Q579708" url="?curid=311862" title="Sonic CD">
<text>, simply known as Sonic CD, is a 1993 platform game developed and published by Sega for the Sega CD. As Sonic the Hedgehog, the player attempts to protect an extraterrestrial body, Little Planet, from Doctor Robotnik. Like other &quot;Sonic&quot; games, Sonic runs through themed levels while collecting rings and defeating robots. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; introduces time travel as a game mechanic. By traveling through time, players can access different versions of stages, featuring alternative layouts, music, and graphics. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; features the debuts of the characters Amy Rose and Metal Sonic.

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; began as a port of the Sega Genesis game &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991), but developed into a separate project. Led by &quot;Sonic&quot; co-creator Naoto Ohshima, the developers sought to showcase the technical capabilities of the Sega CD, with animated cutscenes by Studio Junio and CD-quality music. The soundtrack, influenced by house and techno, was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata. For North America, a new soundtrack was composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young and Mark Crew.

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; was released in late 1993. It received acclaim and is often regarded as one of the best &quot;Sonic&quot; platform games. Reviewers praised its size, music, and time travel feature, although some felt it did not fully use the Sega CD&#x27;s capabilities. It sold over 1.5 million copies, making it the bestselling Sega CD game. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; was ported to Windows as part of the Sega PC label in 1996, and to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube as part of &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; in 2005. A remake, developed by Christian Whitehead using the Retro Engine, was released for various platforms in 2011 and as part of the &quot;Sonic Origins&quot; compilation in 2022.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; is a side-scrolling platform game similar to the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog as he ventures to stop his nemesis Doctor Robotnik from obtaining the magical Time Stones and conquering Little Planet. Like previous games, Sonic can destroy enemies and objects (such as certain walls and television monitors containing power-ups) by rolling into a ball, and collects rings as a form of health. Sonic can also perform a &quot;spin dash&quot; and a &quot;super peel-out&quot;, both of which increase his speed. The game has seven levels; each is split into three zones, the third of which ends in a boss fight against Robotnik. Players start with three lives, which are lost when they suffer any type of damage without rings in their possession; losing all lives results in a game over.

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; is differentiated from other &quot;Sonic&quot; games through its time travel game mechanic, which allows players to access different versions of rounds set in the past, present, and future. The music changes within the different time zones, as remixes of the present music. Sonic starts the first two zones in the present. The third zone is always set in the future, its timeline dependent upon whether the player destroyed both transporters in the past. He travels through time by hitting signs labelled &quot;past&quot; or &quot;future&quot;, maintaining his speed afterward. By default, future stages are neglected and littered with machinery after Robotnik has conquered the Little Planet, appropriately named &quot;bad futures.&quot; Players are encouraged to convert each zone into a &quot;good future&quot;, with bright colors, thriving nature, and few enemies. To achieve a good future in each zone, players must travel to the past and destroy a hidden transporter where enemy robots spawn. Achieving a good future in every zone unlocks the best ending.

By finishing a level with more than 50 rings, Sonic can access a special stage, in which he must destroy six UFOs in a pseudo-3D environment within a time limit. Time is reduced swiftly if the player runs through water, though a special UFO that appears when time is running out grants extra time if destroyed. If the player destroys all the UFOs before the time runs out, they earn a Time Stone. Collecting all seven Time Stones automatically creates a good future in every zone, unlocking the best ending. The game also features a time attack mode, where players can replay completed levels for the fastest time possible; a &quot;D.A. Garden&quot;, where players can listen to the music of completed zones; and a &quot;Visual Mode&quot;, where players can view the opening and closing animations. The game also includes a save feature, which uses the back-up memory of the Sega CD.

==Plot==
At Never Lake, an extraterrestrial body, Little Planet, appears in the last month of every year. Sonic&#x27;s nemesis, Dr. Robotnik, has chained the planet to a mountain and begun transforming it into a giant fortress with his robot army. To execute his plan, Robotnik uses the Time Stones, seven diamonds which control the flow of time, hidden in the different zones. Sonic ventures to the planet, followed by the besotted Amy Rose, his self-proclaimed girlfriend. Robotnik dispatches his newest invention, Metal Sonic, to kidnap Amy at Collision Chaos, luring Sonic into danger.

After outrunning Metal Sonic in Stardust Speedway and saving Amy, Sonic fights and defeats Robotnik in his lair, Metallic Madness. Two endings exist, depending on whether or not the player collected the Time Stones or achieved a good future in each level. In the good ending, Little Planet thanks Sonic with a shower of stars and leaves Never Lake; in the bad ending, Little Planet still leaves, but Robotnik uses the Time Stones to bring it back and the player is urged to replay the game to achieve the good ending.

==Development==
===Background and conception===

The original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991) was developed by Sonic Team at Sega. It was a major commercial success and positioned Sega as Nintendo&#x27;s main rival in the console market. The lead programmer, Yuji Naka, dissatisfied with Sega of Japan&#x27;s rigid corporate policies, moved with several members of Sonic Team to the United States to develop &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; with Sega Technical Institute (STI). Meanwhile, Sega planned to release the Sega CD add-on for its Genesis, and wanted a &quot;Sonic&quot; game that would demonstrate its more advanced features. Naoto Ohshima, the designer of Sonic, was &quot;Sonic CD&quot;″s director; the remainder of the team comprised Sega staff who had developed &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot;, &quot;Golden Axe II&quot;, and &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;. The team built &quot;Sonic CD&quot; using the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; code as a base.

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; was conceived as an enhanced port of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for the Sega CD, but it gradually developed into a separate project. It was titled &quot;CD Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; before being renamed &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. Ohshima does not consider &quot;Sonic CD&quot; a sequel to &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; or &quot;Sonic 2&quot;, although the artist Yasushi Yamaguchi said its story may be set between the two.

===Design===
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; had a balance on speed and platforming; STI built on the speed with &quot;Sonic 2&quot;″s more focused level designs. However, Ohshima&#x27;s team sought to focus on the platforming and exploration aspects. Ohshima said, &quot;our ideas were to make the world and setting larger, and to add more replayability, so it would be something you could enjoy playing for a long time&quot;. According to artist Kazuyuki Hoshino, because it was a Sega CD game, the team wanted &quot;Sonic CD&quot; to stand out compared to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. The visuals were designed to resemble CG imagery; the Sonic sprite on the title screen was based on a Sonic figurine by Taku Makino that the team photographed and scanned.

&quot;Sonic CD&quot; marks the debuts of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both designed by Hoshino. Although Hoshino created Amy&#x27;s in-game graphics, many staff members contributed ideas to her design. Her headband and trainer shoes reflected Ohshima&#x27;s tastes while her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time. Hoshino designed Metal Sonic in response to Ohshima wanting a strong rival for Sonic. Hoshino had a clear image of Metal Sonic in his mind from the moment he was briefed, and his design emerged after only a few sketches. The character graphics were created using Sega&#x27;s proprietary graphics system for the Genesis, the &quot;Sega Digitizer MK-III&quot;, featuring a bitmap and animation editor. The team mostly used Macintosh IIcis. Graphics data was stored on 3.5-inch floppy disks, which were handed to the programmer to work into the game. Though Naka was not directly involved with &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, he exchanged design ideas with Ohshima.

Ohshima cited the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) as an influence on the time travel. The developers designed four variants of each stage, one for each time period. Ohshima hoped for the period to change instantly with a &quot;sonic boom&quot; effect, but the programmers argued this was impossible and produced a loading sequence instead. Sega did not pressure the team developing &quot;Sonic CD&quot; as much as the one developing &quot;Sonic 2&quot;. Ohshima felt this was because &quot;Sonic CD&quot; is not a numbered sequel; he considered it a recreation of the original game. The total &quot;Sonic CD&quot; game data is 21 megabytes (MB), compared to &quot;Sonic 2&quot;″s 1 MB. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; includes animated cutscenes produced by Studio Junio. The videos used the STM format, which provided uncompressed imagery to the video display processor, creating better results than the Cinepak compression used for other Sega CD games. The special stages feature Mode 7-like background plane manipulation effects. An underground dungeon stage was cut early in development as it did not fit the &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay.

===Music===
The &quot;Sonic CD&quot; soundtrack was composed by Naofumi Hataya and Masafumi Ogata. According to Hataya, Sega allocated a large audio budget to showcase the audio functionality of the Sega CD, aiming for CD-quality music superior to video game music of the time. The team worked with the Japanese music production company Being, and enlisted Keiko Utoku to provide vocals. The music was recorded in the Being studios.

Hataya and Ogata&#x27;s first demo songs were rejected by Ohshima, who wanted a more bold, experimental sound. They instead composed music inspired by the increasing popularity of house and techno in Japan, citing inspiration from acts including C+C Music Factory, Frankie Knuckles and the KLF. They were also inspired by the popularity of Sonic in British DJ culture at the time. The team composed music to match the past, present and future versions of each stage. While most tracks use CD audio, the past stages use sample-based PCM tracks to evoke a &quot;prehistoric&quot; feeling. An album of remixes by Hataya and Ogata was released in Japan in late 1994.

Sega of America delayed the North American release of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; for two months to have a new soundtrack composed by Spencer Nilsen, David Young and Mark Crew. Nilsen said Sega of America &quot;wanted something a little more musically rich and complex&quot;, with a theme song they could use in marketing. The new theme song, &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, was composed by Nilsen and performed by the female vocal trio Pastiche. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described the American soundtrack as &quot;more orchestral and &#x27;rocking&#x27; ... a bit more &#x27;epic&#x27; and almost mournful&quot;, with &quot;a sense of dread&quot; compared to the &quot;bouncy and joyful&quot; Japanese soundtrack. Nilsen said the two soundtracks represented &quot;completely different musical philosophies and approaches&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Sonic CD&quot; was released in Japan on September 23, 1993, and in Europe a few weeks later in October. After being delayed for the new soundtrack, it was released in North America in November 23, 1993, alongside &quot;Sonic Chaos&quot; and &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; as part of Sega of America&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Three on One Day&quot; release strategy. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; was the flagship game for Sega CD and its only &quot;Sonic&quot; game. An enhanced version of the original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and a &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed port of &quot;Popful Mail&quot; were canceled.

== Rereleases ==

Two versions of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; were released for Windows: one in 1995 for Pentium processors, and another in 1996 for DirectX. The Pentium version was only bundled with new computers and never sold in stores; Sega worked with Intel to make the game work properly. The DirectX version was released under the Sega PC label, and it was released in North America on July 8 and in Japan on August 9. This version is mostly identical to the original release, but loading screens were added and it is only compatible with older versions of Windows. Both Windows versions use the North American soundtrack.

The 1996 Windows version was ported to the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in August 2005 for &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot;. This port uses the original soundtrack in Japan and the North American soundtrack elsewhere. The ports introduced some graphical problems, such as a blurry anti-flicker presentation, but the opening animation is presented in a higher quality fullscreen view.

In 2009, independent programmer Christian Whitehead produced a proof-of-concept video of a remastered version of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, using his Retro Engine, running on iOS. Sega released this version in December 2011 for Android, iOS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and later in January 2012 for Windows via Steam with assistance from BlitWorks in the PC and console ports. The remaster features enhancements such as widescreen graphics, fine-tuned collision detection to make time traveling more consistent, refined visuals and frame rate for Special Stages, the option for spin dash physics from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot;, both the Japanese and North American soundtracks, the ability to unlock Tails as a playable character, and achievement and trophy support. Whitehead designed two original stages, but they were excluded as Sega wanted to keep the game faithful to the original release. The remaster was not released on the Wii as it exceeded the WiiWare download size. It was included in the 2022 compilation &quot;Sonic Origins&quot;, which removed voice lines for Sonic and Amy. Amy and Knuckles also became selectable characters in a later update to &quot;Origins.&quot;

==Reception==
The Sega CD version sold more than 1.5 million copies, making it the system&#x27;s best-seller. In the United Kingdom, it was the top-selling Mega CD game in December 1993.

The game received critical acclaim. The presentation, visuals, and audio were praised. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; wrote that, although &quot;Sonic CD&quot; did not use the Sega CD&#x27;s capabilities to its fullest, the graphics and sound were excellent, calling the music &quot;from the likes of 2Unlimited and Bizarre Inc&quot;. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; said that the game looked similar to older games and used the Sega CD&#x27;s special features minimally, but this did not detract from the quality. The music was singled out as making &quot;Sonic CD&quot; &quot;stand above the crowd&quot;; the reviewer wrote that it helped add richness. The reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;) praised the animated cinematics and sound, but noted frame rate drops during special stages. Retrospective opinions of the presentation have also been positive. &quot;IGN&quot; praised its vibrant colors and felt the game looked nice, and &quot;GamesRadar&quot; thought its music stood the test of time, writing: &quot;What must&#x27;ve dated very quickly in the 1990s is somehow totally fresh today.&quot;

Critics were divided over the change of soundtrack in the North American version. &quot;GameFan&quot;, which had given the Japanese version of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; a score of 100%, lambasted the change. &quot;GameFan&quot; editor Dave Halverson called the change &quot;an atrocity that remains the biggest injustice in localization history&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;GamesRadar&quot; said he shut his GameCube off in disgust when he realized &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; used the American soundtrack. Nilsen said the criticism was &quot;blown out of proportion&quot;, as if they had &quot;replaced the music for &quot;Star Wars&quot; after the movie had been out for a while&quot;.

The gameplay was widely praised. &quot;EGM&quot; admired the diverse levels and felt the time travel added depth. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; wrote that &quot;Sonic CD&quot; played as well as previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, and that the time travel—coupled with large levels rich with secrets and &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;-like special stages—added replayability. &quot;Sega Pro&quot; also noted the expanded environments and the replay value travel added by the time travel, writing that &quot;the more you play &quot;Sonic CD&quot; the better it gets&quot;, but felt it was too easy. In its debut issue, &quot;Sega Magazine&quot; said &quot;Sonic CD&quot; was &quot;potentially a classic&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; singled out the &quot;interesting level design and the time-travelling gameplay&quot; as a major selling point, saying it provided a unique take on the classic &quot;Sonic&quot; formula.

Critics wrote that &quot;Sonic CD&quot; was one of the best Sega CD games. &quot;Electronic Games&quot; called it a must-have, and &quot;Sega Pro&quot; said it was &quot;brilliant&quot;, imaginative and worth more than its price. &quot;Destructoid&quot; described it as &quot;a hallmark of excellence&quot;, creative, strange, and exciting, and said that &quot;to miss &quot;Sonic CD&quot; would be to miss some of the franchise&#x27;s best&quot;.

Reception to later versions of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; varied. &quot;GameSpot&quot; considered the 1996 Windows version inferior, criticizing its technical performance and &quot;tedious and monotonous&quot; gameplay. The reviewer wrote that &quot;those who have played &quot;Sonic&quot; on a Sega game system will find nothing new here&quot; and that it was not worth its $50 price. Reviews of the version in &quot;Sonic Gems Collection&quot; were favorable. &quot;IGN&quot; remembered &quot;Sonic CD&quot; as one of the best things about the Sega CD and called it a standout for the compilation, and a major selling point. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; wrote: &quot;Rejoice for &quot;Sonic CD&quot;... Just don&#x27;t rejoice for anything else [in &quot;Sonic Gems Collection]&quot;, because it&#x27;s mostly rubbish.&quot; According to Metacritic, the 2011 console version received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the iOS version received &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Sonic CD&quot; is frequently named among the best &quot;Sonic&quot; games and platform games. In 1997, &quot;EGM&quot; named it the 17th best console game of all time, citing the bonus levels and animated intro.

==Legacy==
The story of &quot;Sonic CD&quot; was adapted in the twenty-fifth issue of Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book series. The adaptation featured some changes to the story, such as Tails being an important character and Metal Sonic having the ability to talk. British publisher Fleetway Publications published their own adaptation in &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;. The final issue of Archie&#x27;s comic, #290 (December 2016), also featured a retelling of the game&#x27;s story.

Two characters introduced in &quot;Sonic CD&quot;, Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, became recurring characters in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series. Metal Sonic appeared as an antagonist in &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; (1995), the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; anime film (1996), &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; (2003), &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II&quot; (2012) and &quot;Sonic Mania&quot; (2017). Amy Rose most notably appears in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. The &quot;Sonic CD&quot; animated sequences were included as bonuses in the compilations &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997) and &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; (2002), and &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; was used as one of Sonic&#x27;s themes in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008).

In 2011, Sega released &quot;Sonic Generations&quot; in celebration of the franchise&#x27;s 20th anniversary, which includes a remake of the boss battle against Metal Sonic. &quot;Sonic Mania&quot;, produced for the series&#x27; twenty-fifth anniversary, features updated versions of &quot;Sonic CD&quot;″s Stardust Speedway and Metallic Madness levels, including a boss battle against Metal Sonic.

<doc id="311872" wikidata="Q6765456" url="?curid=311872" title="Marion Woodman">
<text>Marion Jean Woodman (née Boa; August 15, 1928 – July 9, 2018) was a Canadian mythopoeic author, poet, analytical psychologist and women&#x27;s movement figure. She wrote and spoke extensively about the dream theories of Carl Jung. Her works include &quot;Addiction to Perfection&quot;, &quot;The Pregnant Virgin&quot; and &quot;Bone: Dying into Life&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Woodman was born on August 15, 1928, in London, Ontario, the eldest of three children of Ila (née Phinn) and Andrew Boa, a clergyman. She completed a degree in English literature at the University of Western Ontario. Later in life she studied psychology at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich, Switzerland.

==Career==
Woodman taught high school English for more than twenty years. Suffering from anorexia, she took a sabbatical with her husband a college professor, and traveled first to India and then to England, where she became interested in the theories of Carl Jung. She entered analysis with Jung&#x27;s British colleague, E. A. Bennet. She subsequently enrolled in the C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich, and trained as an analyst.

In 1982, Woodman wrote a book about analytic psychology, &quot;Addiction to Perfection&quot;, which was published by the new company, Inner City Books, set up by her colleague Daryl Sharp.

Woodman continued to write on the subject of feminine psychology, focusing on psyche and soma. She has also lectured internationally. She has written collaboratively with Thomas Moore, Jill Mellick and Robert Bly.

Woodman was listed in Watkins&#x27; &quot;Mind Body Spirit&quot; Magazine in 2012 as the 100th most spiritually influential living person. Her collection of audio and visual lectures, correspondence, and manuscripts are housed at the Pacifica Graduate Institute, OPUS Archives and Research Center, in Santa Barbara, California.

==Personal life==
Her husband Ross Woodman was Professor at the University of Western Ontario. He is the author of &quot;The Apocalyptic Vision in the Poetry of Shelley&quot;, and &quot;Sanity, Madness, Transformation: The Psyche in Romanticism&quot;, both published by the University of Toronto Press. Ross Woodman died at their home in London, Ontario, on 20 March 2014.

Her younger brothers were the actor Bruce Boa and the Jungian analyst Fraser Boa, both of whom predeceased her.

In November, 1993, Woodman was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She recorded the subsequent two years of cancer treatment in a journal, which was later published as &quot;Bone: Dying into Life&quot;. She died at her home in London, Ontario, on July 9, 2018, aged 89.

She is the author of &quot;Women Who Run with the Wolves&quot; (1992), which remained on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 145 weeks and has sold over two million copies.

==Life and career==
Estés was born in Gary, Indiana, to Emilio Maria Reyés and Cepción Ixtiz, who were from Mexico. She was later adopted by Hungarian immigrants. She is a certified senior Jungian analyst. She earned her doctorate from the Union Institute &amp; University [1981] in ethno-clinical psychology on the study of social and psychological patterns in cultural and tribal groups. She is the author of many books on the journey of the soul. Beginning in 1992 and onward, her work has been published in 37 languages. Her book &quot;Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of The Wild Woman Archetype&quot; was on the &quot;New York Times&quot;&#x27; best seller list for 145 weeks, as well as other best seller lists, including &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

Estés began her work in the 1960s at the Edward Hines Jr. Veterans Administration Hospital in Hines, Illinois. There she worked with World War I, World War II, Korean and Vietnam War soldiers who were living with quadraplegia, incapacitated by loss of arms and legs. She has worked at other facilities caring for severely injured children as well as shell-shocked war veterans and their families. Her teaching of writing, storytelling and traditional medicine practices continued in prisons, beginning in the early 1970s at the Men&#x27;s Penitentiary in Colorado; the Federal Women&#x27;s Prison at Dublin, California; the Montview Facility for Youth in Colorado; and other institutions.

Estés served as a board member of the Maya Angelou Minority Health Foundation (now called Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity) at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Estés served as appointee by Colorado governors Romer and Owens to the Colorado State Grievance Board of the Department of Regulatory Agencies (D.O.R.A.) from 1993 to 2006. She was elected as chair and for thirteen years worked with the state of Colorado Attorney General&#x27;s lawyers, as well as a board of legal experts and helping professionals, to focus on public safety regarding mental health practitioners. She has been an advisory board member for the National Writers Union, New York; and an advisory board member of the National Coalition Against Censorship, New York. She is an advisor to El Museo de las Americas, Denver, Colorado, and a contributing editor and storyteller-in-residence for &quot;The Bloomsbury Review&quot;.

Estés debuted in spoken word performance at Carnegie Hall, New York (2000), along with Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison. Together the author-poets wrote lyrical song-poems for a libretto of &quot;woman.life.song.&quot;.

Estés is managing editor for TheModeratevoice.com. She has written for the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Publishers&#x27; Weekly&quot; and &quot;The Denver Post&quot;. Estés&#x27; Guadalupe Foundation has funded literacy projects.

<text>A hobby shop (or hobby store) sells recreational items for hobbyists.

==Types==
===Modelling===
Classical hobby stores specialize in modelling and craft supplies and specialty magazines for model airplanes (military craft, private airplanes and airliners), model trains (locomotives, rolling stock, track, power packs and accessories), ship models, house and building models. Some hobby shops sell R/C cars, pinewood derby kits, boats, and model or remote control planes.

===Collectibles===

Some hobby shops may also sell dolls, figures, and collectible coins and stamps.

===Gaming===

A subtype of hobby shop is a game store, which sells jigsaw puzzles, card and board games and role playing games. Such stores sometimes may also contain community space for hobbyists (gamers) to mingle and play games. In recent years, board and card game hobby shops have often become part-cafes.
===Computer===

Another subtype of hobby shop is the computer store, which sells computers, software, services, and training. Computer hobby shops have traditionally sold computers, related network equipment, and services, more often than not, they are selling training in software like Adobe PhotoShop, Autodesk 3ds, web design and other creative software pursuits. As technology continues to evolve, the post &quot;dot com&quot; computer hobby shops have transformed these equipment and services to hands-on training environments where people gather and learn from one another. This is because several people who work in technology also have it as a hobby.

<doc id="311887" wikidata="Q2090114" url="?curid=311887" title="Prudhoe">
<text>Prudhoe ( ) is a town and civil parish in the south of Northumberland, England. It is west of Newcastle upon Tyne and situated on a steep, north-facing hill on the south bank of the River Tyne. Prudhoe had a population of 11,675 at the 2011 census, making it the second largest town in the Tyne Valley after Hexham.

Nearby villages include Ovingham, Ovington, Wylam, Stocksfield, Hedley on the Hill and Mickley.

== History ==

The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon personal name Prud (from , meaning &#x27;proud&#x27;) and &quot;hoe&quot; or &quot;haugh&quot;, &#x27;a spur of land&#x27;.

There has been a castle at Prudhoe since ancient times, when England was at war with Scotland. The area now known as Castlefields was a fruit orchard, and the Scots were rumoured to have burnt this orchard while attempting to capture Prudhoe Castle. The castle, originally owned by the d&#x27;Umfraville family, then the Percys and now English Heritage, is considered to be the only medieval fortification in Northumberland never to have been captured by the Scots.

In 1914, a Territorial Army drill hall was developed on Swalwell Close, which housed a company of the 4th Battalion of the Northumberland Fusiliers. The drill hall site (now disused) was scheduled to be redeveloped from 2018, with the scheme further delayed and complicated by the jailing of the owner for eight years in 2021.

During the Cold War, there was a Royal Observer Corps Underground Monitoring Post opposite Highfield Park; the surface features have since been demolished. It was one of approximately 1,563 similar underground monitoring posts built all across the UK during the Cold War to monitor the effects of a nuclear strike. They were operated by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC), mostly civilian volunteers, who worked in groups of three inside the posts. Prudhoe ROC post was opened in June 1962 and closed in September 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, which saw the end of the Cold War.

== Governance ==

Local government services for Prudhoe are provided by Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority. Electorally, the town is located within the parliamentary constituency of Hexham and is therefore represented by Joe Morris of the Labour Party in the House of Commons. 

For Northumberland County Council elections, the civil parish is divided into three electoral divisions: Prudhoe North (represented by Labour), Prudhoe South (Conservative) and Stocksfield and Broomshaugh (Independent). Ward boundary recommendations propose redrawing Prudhoe&#x27;s electoral map into Prudhoe West, Prudhoe South and Prudhoe North and Wylam divisions.

Prudhoe Town Council meets at The Spetchells Centre, Front Street, in the centre of town.

== Geography ==

The town of Prudhoe is built on a steep, north-facing hill, which reaches elevations exceeding 200 metres up on the Prudhoe and Mickley Moors. The south of the parish is largely rural and comprises both farmland and forest. The castle overlooks a gentle bend in the River Tyne. To the south of Prudhoe is Hedley on the Hill and then Ebchester over the County Durham border. Prudhoe is also home to Hagg Bank, a steep hill which winds down to Hagg Bank Farm on the riverside. The civil parish borders Tyne and Wear (as well as historic County Durham) over Stanley Burn in the east of town.

== Industry ==
Prudhoe was once a coal mining town. There is still evidence of the old coal mine at West Wylam, signified by a miner&#x27;s cart when driving into Castlefields up Cockshot Dean. The cart was found in brambles nearby by a former mine employee. This was the site of West Wylam Colliery. The main drift entrance of the colliery is buried under the modern road.

The town has an industrial estate, called Low Prudhoe that lies alongside the A695 road, which now bypasses the town to the north. There are a few factories and several smaller businesses straddling the side of this road.

Prudhoe has one large factory operated by Essity. Originally built by Kimberly-Clark, the mill was bought by SCA after the Monopolies Commission forced Kimberly-Clark to sell. The factory consists of the mill, housing the paper machines, converting lines, warehousing and Unifibres and makes paper products such as tissues. The site where SCA stands was first used by ICI for producing agricultural fertiliser (sulfate and ammonium sulfate). In 1963 this plant closed leaving behind the &quot;Spetchells&quot; chalk hills – heaps of waste product which were subsequently turfed over. After ICI closed, the site was owned by Cleveland Engineering, which produced automobile parts, and following its closure in 1969 Kimberly-Clark opened.

== Health facility ==
Once home to a 1200-patient large mental health hospital based on the former Prudhoe Hall site, Prudhoe was then home to a 40-bed specialist mental health facility for children and young people, Ferndene, which is operated by Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust.

== Landmarks ==

=== Prudhoe Castle ===

Prudhoe Castle is a Norman castle, which was for a long time involved in the border wars between England and Scotland. It was built by the d&#x27;Umfraville family: the Norman Sir Robert de Umfraville was granted the freedom of Redesdale by William the Conqueror. For much of its history the castle was owned by the Percy family. It is now run by English Heritage. The castle is unique in being the only medieval defensive fortification in the whole of Northumbria to avoid capture by the Scots.

The majority of the surviving building work dates from the 12th century, although the site of Prudhoe Castle has strong Norman origins. In the 14th/15th centuries, the tower was extended to provide an extra level with turrets. Only the southwest turret survives to this day.

=== Important religious sites ===
Prudhoe Hall (built 1868–70) and the Catholic Church of Our Lady and St Cuthbert in Prudhoe (built 1890–91, but incorporating the Cottier windows from an earlier smaller chapel built 1868–70) have some of Daniel Cottier&#x27;s earliest stained glass. Matthew Liddell presumably commissioned Cottier to design the stained glass windows in both the main hall and the original chapel because his architect, Archibald Dunn, was impressed by the fact that Cottier had recently won a prize for the superb harmony of colours in his armorial window at the 1867 Paris International Exhibition. Indeed, Daniel Cottier has referred to his Paris prize in the graphite border of the large window in the main hall of Prudhoe Hall.

The stained glass in the small original chapel, which was opened on 19 October 1870, was eventually incorporated in the enlarged church of 1891 and then subsequently moved again a mile into the town of Prudhoe in 1904–05, when the Liddell family moved away from the area and could no longer support the Catholic mission, which Matthew Liddell had begun in 1870. The black-and-white photographs of the first chapel at Prudhoe Hall in Fr Paul Zielinski&#x27;s book, &quot;The Church that Moved&quot;, show exactly the same windows containing the Cottier glass that have been retained in the larger church that replaced it. This means that the Cottier windows have been moved twice from their original site, and this would explain the necessity for so much extra remedial lead-work within some of the panes of glass, presumably repairing damage caused by two removals and two re-installations.

The small windows at Prudhoe Hall depicting idyllic naturalistic scenes of a rising sun over a river are especially beautiful, and seem to have a strong similarity to the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Made in about 1870, they pre-date by ten years or more the collaboration between Cottier and Tiffany in the 1880s in America. The swaying reeds in particular would seem to suggest that Cottier may well have been a significant influence on Tiffany before Tiffany returned the compliment, and Cottier brought some of his ideas back into his own artistic creations in Scotland.

There is a memorial stone to John Wesley set in a low wall on South Road (outside the former Prudhoe Council offices), the former main street of the town, commemorating his visits to the town.

Historically, the parish church for Prudhoe was across the river at Ovingham. Since 1880, however, it has been served by the Church of St Mary Magdalene off Front Street.

=== West Wylam ===

Towards the eastern edge of Prudhoe is West Wylam, an area of largely social housing. It is home to an elderly care home, Prudhoe Town AFC, a small row of takeaways as well as a local NISA store and Eastwood Park; where several local football teams play their league games. The area also has allotments and Adderlane First School, which was opened in 1978. The last church on the estate, West Wylam Ebenezer Methodist Church, closed in 2014.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Prudhoe is linked to Newcastle upon Tyne and the A1 by the A695 which used to pass through the centre of the town along Front Street. The A695 road now bypasses the town to the north through the industrial estate at Low Prudhoe. The better transport links of the new bypass have allowed the industrial estate to expand alongside the new road to the east, named Princess Way after the royal who opened SCA Hygiene.

Northumberland County Council sought a significant landmark feature adjacent to the new bypass, and commissioned the Prudhoe Badger under their &#x27;percent for art&#x27; policy. The sculpture is 30m long, and was constructed with the help of drystone wallers in stone and marble. It was designed to integrate with the rural environment, create awareness about ecology and provide a link with the nearby Countryside Centre. The badger sculpture is sited adjacent to the roundabout on the A695 road at Low Prudhoe.

=== Railway ===

The town is served by Prudhoe railway station on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, also known as the Tyne Valley Line. The line was opened in 1838, and links the city of Newcastle upon Tyne with Carlisle. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland. Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Line are operated by Northern only after the May 2022 timetable change. The line is also used for freight. The next railway stations are those at Wylam and Stocksfield.

=== Bus ===
The town has direct bus links to Newcastle, Hexham and the MetroCentre.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Pontop Pike TV transmitter and one of the two relay transmitters (Newton and Fenham).

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Heart North East, Capital North East, Smooth Radio North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Hits Radio North East, Koast Radio and Radio Prudhoe, a community based station.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Hexham Courant&quot; and &quot;Chronicle Extra&quot;.

== Sport ==

Prudhoe has its own senior football club, Prudhoe Town AFC, which formerly resided at Kimberley Park, West Wylam.

== Recreation ==

Tyne Riverside Country Park in Low Prudhoe lies on the southern bank of the River Tyne. The park includes the artificial chalk hills known as the &quot;Spetchells&quot; which have attracted some natural chalk-loving flora and fauna not normally found in the region. It has been proposed that they be made &#x27;sites of scientific interest&#x27;. A public bridleway runs from the country park to Hagg Bank, over the Points Bridge to Wylam. Now forming a traffic-free part of National Cycle Network Route 72, it runs on the bed of a disused railway line to Newburn, Tyne and Wear, Newcastle upon Tyne, and on to the coast at Tynemouth.

Prudhoe Town Football Club are currently in the Wearside Football League, in the eleventh tier of the English football league system. The future of the club has recently been in doubt following the loss of its ground, Kimberley Park, in West Wylam.

Prudhoe Waterworld provides swimming and other fitness activities and is the home of Prudhoe Millennium Tapestry.

The town has a skatepark, Highfield Park, which is located at the top of Prudhoe.

<text>The cornea is the transparent front part of the eyeball which covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. Along with the anterior chamber and lens, the cornea refracts light, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the eye&#x27;s total optical power. In humans, the refractive power of the cornea is approximately 43 dioptres. The cornea can be reshaped by surgical procedures such as LASIK.

While the cornea contributes most of the eye&#x27;s focusing power, its focus is fixed. Accommodation (the refocusing of light to better view near objects) is accomplished by changing the geometry of the lens. Medical terms related to the cornea often start with the prefix &quot;&quot; from the Greek word κέρας, &quot;horn&quot;.

==Structure==
The cornea has unmyelinated nerve endings sensitive to touch, temperature and chemicals; a touch of the cornea causes an involuntary reflex to close the eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the healthy cornea does not have or need blood vessels within it. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface. Nutrients also come via neurotrophins supplied by the nerves of the cornea. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5 mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6 mm in the center and 0.6–0.8 mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.

The most abundant soluble protein in mammalian cornea is albumin.

The human cornea borders with the sclera at the corneal limbus. In lampreys, the cornea is solely an extension of the sclera, and is separate from the skin above it, but in more advanced vertebrates it is always fused with the skin to form a single structure, albeit one composed of multiple layers. In fish, and aquatic vertebrates in general, the cornea plays no role in focusing light, since it has virtually the same refractive index as water.

===Microanatomy===

The human cornea has five layers (possibly six, if the Dua&#x27;s layer is included). Corneas of other primates have five known layers. The corneas of cats, dogs, wolves, and other carnivores only have four. From the anterior to posterior the layers of the human cornea are:

# Corneal epithelium: an exceedingly thin multicellular epithelial tissue layer (non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) of fast-growing and easily regenerated cells, kept moist with tears. Irregularity or edema of the corneal epithelium disrupts the smoothness of the air/tear-film interface, the most significant component of the total refractive power of the eye, thereby reducing visual acuity. Corneal epithelium is continuous with the conjunctival epithelium, and is composed of about 6 layers of cells which are shed constantly on the exposed layer and are regenerated by multiplication in the basal layer.
# Bowman&#x27;s layer (also known as the &quot;anterior limiting membrane&quot;): when discussed in lieu of a subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman&#x27;s Layer is a tough layer composed of collagen (mainly type I collagen fibrils), laminin, nidogen, perlecan and other HSPGs that protects the corneal stroma. When discussed as a separate entity from the subepithelial basement membrane, Bowman&#x27;s Layer can be described as an acellular, condensed region of the apical stroma, composed primarily of randomly organized yet tightly woven collagen fibrils. These fibrils interact with and attach onto each other. This layer is eight to 14 micrometres (μm) thick and is absent or very thin in non-primates.
# Corneal stroma (also &quot;substantia propria&quot;): a thick, transparent middle layer, consisting of regularly arranged collagen fibers along with sparsely distributed interconnected keratocytes, which are the cells for general repair and maintenance. They are parallel and are superimposed like book pages. The corneal stroma consists of approximately 200 layers of mainly type I collagen fibrils. Each layer is 1.5-2.5 μm. Up to 90% of the corneal thickness is composed of stroma. There are 2 theories of how transparency in the cornea comes about:
## The lattice arrangements of the collagen fibrils in the stroma. The light scatter by individual fibrils is cancelled by destructive interference from the scattered light from other individual fibrils.
## The spacing of the neighboring collagen fibrils in the stroma must be &lt; 200 nm for there to be transparency. (Goldman and Benedek)
# Descemet&#x27;s membrane (also &quot;posterior limiting membrane&quot;): a thin acellular layer that serves as the modified basement membrane of the corneal endothelium, from which the cells are derived. This layer is composed mainly of collagen type IV fibrils, less rigid than collagen type I fibrils, and is around 5-20 μm thick, depending on the subject&#x27;s age. Just anterior to Descemet&#x27;s membrane, a very thin and strong layer, Dua&#x27;s layer, 15 microns thick and able to withstand 1.5 to 2 bars of pressure.
# Corneal endothelium: a simple squamous or low cuboidal monolayer, approx 5 μm thick, of mitochondria-rich cells. These cells are responsible for regulating fluid and solute transport between the aqueous and corneal stromal compartments. (The term &quot;endothelium&quot; is a misnomer here. The corneal endothelium is bathed by aqueous humor, not by blood or lymph, and has a very different origin, function, and appearance from vascular endothelia.) Unlike the corneal epithelium, the cells of the endothelium do not regenerate. Instead, they stretch to compensate for dead cells which reduces the overall cell density of the endothelium, which affects fluid regulation. If the endothelium can no longer maintain a proper fluid balance, stromal swelling due to excess fluids and subsequent loss of transparency will occur and this may cause corneal edema and interference with the transparency of the cornea and thus impairing the image formed. Iris pigment cells deposited on the corneal endothelium can sometimes be washed into a distinct vertical pattern by the aqueous currents - this is known as Krukenberg&#x27;s Spindle.

===Nerve supply===
The cornea is one of the most sensitive tissues of the body, as it is densely innervated with sensory nerve fibres via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve by way of 70–80 long ciliary nerves. Research suggests the density of pain receptors in the cornea is 300–600 times greater than skin and 20–40 times greater than dental pulp, making any injury to the structure excruciatingly painful.

The ciliary nerves run under the endothelium and exit the eye through holes in the sclera apart from the optic nerve (which transmits only optic signals). The nerves enter the cornea via three levels; &quot;scleral, episcleral and conjunctival&quot;. Most of the bundles give rise by subdivision to a network in the stroma, from which fibres supply the different regions. The three networks are, &quot;midstromal, subepithelial/sub-basal, and epithelial.&quot; The receptive fields of each nerve ending are very large, and may overlap.

Corneal nerves of the subepithelial layer terminate near the superficial epithelial layer of the cornea in a logarithmic spiral pattern. The density of epithelial nerves decreases with age, especially after the seventh decade.

==Function==
===Refraction===
The optical component is concerned with producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye&#x27;s optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea is considered to be a positive meniscus lens. Some species of birds and chameleons, and one kinown species of fish, also have corneas which can focus.

===Transparency===

Upon death or removal of an eye the cornea absorbs the aqueous humor, thickens, and becomes hazy. Transparency can be restored by putting it in a warm, well-ventilated chamber at 31 °C (88 °F, the normal temperature), allowing the fluid to leave the cornea and become transparent. The cornea takes in fluid from the aqueous humor and the small blood vessels of the limbus, but a pump ejects the fluid immediately upon entry. When energy is deficient the pump may fail, or function too slowly to compensate, leading to swelling. This arises at death, but a dead eye can be placed in a warm chamber with a reservoir of sugar and glycogen that generally keeps the cornea transparent for at least 24 hours.

The endothelium controls this pumping action, and as discussed above, damage thereof is more serious, and is a cause of opaqueness and swelling. When damage to the cornea occurs, such as in a viral infection, the collagen used to repair the process is not regularly arranged, leading to an opaque patch (leukoma).

==Clinical significance==
The most common corneal disorders are the following:
* Corneal abrasion – a medical condition involving the loss of the surface epithelial layer of the eye&#x27;s cornea as a result of trauma to the surface of the eye.
* Corneal dystrophy – a condition in which one or more parts of the cornea lose their normal clarity due to a buildup of cloudy material.
* Corneal ulcer – an inflammatory or infective condition of the cornea involving disruption of its epithelial layer with involvement of the corneal stroma.
* Corneal neovascularization – excessive ingrowth of blood vessels from the limbal vascular plexus into the cornea, caused by deprivation of oxygen from the air.
* Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy – cloudy morning vision.
* Keratitis – inflammation of the cornea.
* Keratoconus – a degenerative disease, the cornea thins and changes shape to be more like a cone.
* Corneal foreign body – a foreign object present in the cornea, one of the most common preventable occupational hazards.

===Management===
====Surgical procedures====

Various refractive eye surgery techniques change the shape of the cornea in order to reduce the need for corrective lenses or otherwise improve the refractive state of the eye. In many of the techniques used today, reshaping of the cornea is performed by photoablation using the excimer laser.

There are also synthetic corneas (keratoprostheses) in development. Most are merely plastic inserts, but there are also those composed of biocompatible synthetic materials that encourage tissue ingrowth into the synthetic cornea, thereby promoting biointegration. Other methods, such as magnetic deformable membranes and optically coherent transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human retina are still in very early stages of research.

====Other procedures====
Orthokeratology is a method using specialized hard or rigid gas-permeable contact lenses to transiently reshape the cornea in order to improve the refractive state of the eye or reduce the need for eyeglasses and contact lenses.

In 2009, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical center demonstrated that stem cell collected from human corneas can restore transparency without provoking a rejection response in mice with corneal damage. For corneal epithelial diseases such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome, persistent corneal ulcer etc., the autologous contralateral (normal) suprabasal limbus derived in vitro expanded corneal limbal stem cells are found to be effective as amniotic membrane based expansion is controversial. For endothelial diseases, such as bullous keratopathy, cadaver corneal endothelial precursor cells have been proven to be efficient. Recently emerging tissue engineering technologies are expected to be capable of making one cadaver-donor&#x27;s corneal cells be expanded and be usable in more than one patient&#x27;s eye.

====Corneal retention and permeability in topical drug delivery to the eye====
The majority of ocular therapeutic agents are administered to the eye via the topical route. Cornea is one of the main barriers for drug diffusion because of its highly impermeable nature. Its continuous irrigation with a tear fluid also results in poor retention of the therapeutic agents on the ocular surface. Poor permeability of the cornea and quick wash out of therapeutic agents from ocular surface result in very low bioavailability of the drugs administered via topical route (typically less than 5%). Poor retention of formulations on ocular surfaces could potentially be improved with the use of mucoadhesive polymers. Drug permeability through the cornea could be facilitated with addition of penetration enhancers into topical formulations.

=== Transplantation ===

If the corneal stroma develops visually significant opacity, irregularity, or edema, a cornea of a deceased donor can be transplanted. Because there are no blood vessels in the cornea, there are also few problems with rejection of the new cornea.

When a cornea is needed for transplant, as from an eye bank, the best procedure is to remove the cornea from the eyeball, preventing the cornea from absorbing the aqueous humor.

There is a global shortage of corneal donations, severely limiting the availability of corneal transplants across most of the world. A 2016 study found that 12.7 million visually impaired people were in need of a corneal transplant, with only 1 cornea available for every 70 needed. Many countries have years-long waitlists for corneal transplant surgery due to the shortage of donated corneas. Only a handful of countries consistently have a large enough supply of donated corneas to meet local demand without a waitlist, including the United States, Italy, and Sri Lanka.

<text>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN), also called Fothergill disease, tic douloureux, trifacial neuralgia, is a long-term pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve, the nerve responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. It is a form of neuropathic pain. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia.

The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours. The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe. Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face. Both forms may occur in the same person. Pain from the disease has been linked to mental health issues, especially depression. 

The exact cause is unknown, but believed to involve loss of the myelin of the trigeminal nerve. This might occur due to nerve compression from a blood vessel as the nerve exits the brain stem, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or trauma. Less common causes include a tumor or arteriovenous malformation. It is a type of nerve pain. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms, after ruling out other possible causes such as postherpetic neuralgia.
Treatment includes medication or surgery. The anticonvulsant carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is usually the initial treatment, and is effective in about 90% of people. Side effects are frequently experienced that necessitate drug withdrawal in as many as 23% of patients. Other options include lamotrigine, baclofen, gabapentin, amitriptyline and pimozide. Opioids are not usually effective in the typical form. In those who do not improve or become resistant to other measures, a number of types of surgery may be tried.
It is estimated that trigeminal neuralgia affects around 0.03% to 0.3% of people around the world with a female over-representation around a 3:1 ratio between women and men. It usually begins in people over 50 years old, but can occur at any age. The condition was first described in detail in 1773 by John Fothergill.
==Signs and symptoms==

This disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. The trigeminal nerve is a paired cranial nerve that has three major branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the maxillary nerve or V2) and lower branch (mandibular nerve or V3) of the trigeminal nerve.

An individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours, but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks. In other instances, only 4–10 attacks are experienced daily. The episodes of intense pain may occur paroxysmally. To describe the pain sensation, people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode; however, in many people, the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation.

It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving and brushing teeth. The wind, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said, by those affected, to feel like stabbing electric shocks, burning, sharp, pressing, crushing, exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable.

The pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time, in some people. Pain may migrate to other branches over time but in some people remains very stable.

Bilateral (occurring on both sides) trigeminal neuralgia is very rare except for trigeminal neuralgia caused by multiple sclerosis (MS). This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves, since one nerve serves the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Occasional reports of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia reflect successive episodes of unilateral (only one side) pain switching the side of the face rather than pain occurring simultaneously on both sides.

Rapid spreading of the pain, bilateral involvement or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks (such as Painful Tic Convulsif of nerves V &amp; VII or occurrence of symptoms in the V and IX nerves) may suggest a systemic cause. Systemic causes could include multiple sclerosis or expanding cranial tumors.

The severity of the pain makes it difficult to wash the face, shave, and perform good oral hygiene. The pain has a significant impact on activities of daily living especially as those affected live in fear of when they are going to get their next attack of pain and how severe it will be. It can lead to severe depression and anxiety.

However, not all people will have the symptoms described above; there are variants of TN, one of which is atypical trigeminal neuralgia (&quot;trigeminal neuralgia, type 2&quot; or trigeminal neuralgia with concomitant pain), based on a recent classification of facial pain. In these instances there is also a more prolonged lower severity background pain that can be present for over 50% of the time and is described more as a burning or prickling, rather than a shock.

Trigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster. Post-herpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Herpes zoster oticus typically presents with inability to move many facial muscles, pain in the ear, taste loss on the front of the tongue, dry eyes and mouth, and a vesicular rash. Less than 1% of varicella zoster infections involve the facial nerve and result in this occurring.

Trigeminal deafferentation pain (TDP), also termed anesthesia dolorosa, or colloquially as phantom face pain, is from unintentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to fix a nerve problem surgically. This pain is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness. TDP is very difficult to treat as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.

==Causes==

The trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as tactition (pressure), thermoception (temperature), and nociception (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the muscles of mastication, the muscles involved in chewing but not facial expression.

Several theories exist to explain the possible causes of this pain syndrome. It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel – most commonly the superior cerebellar artery – compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the pons. Such a compression can injure the nerve&#x27;s protective myelin sheath and cause erratic and hyperactive functioning of the nerve. This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve as well as hinder the nerve&#x27;s ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends. This type of injury may rarely be caused by an aneurysm (an outpouching of a blood vessel); by an AVM (arteriovenous malformation); by a tumor; such as an arachnoid cyst or meningioma in the cerebellopontine angle; or by a traumatic event, such as a car accident.

Short-term peripheral compression is often painless. Persistent compression results in local demyelination with no loss of axon potential continuity. Chronic nerve entrapment results in demyelination primarily, with progressive axonal degeneration subsequently. It is, &quot;therefore widely accepted that trigeminal neuralgia is associated with demyelination of axons in the Gasserian ganglion, the dorsal root, or both.&quot; It has been suggested that this compression may be related to an aberrant branch of the superior cerebellar artery that lies on the trigeminal nerve. Further causes, besides an aneurysm, multiple sclerosis or cerebellopontine angle tumor, include: a posterior fossa tumor, any other expanding lesion or even brainstem diseases from strokes.

Trigeminal neuralgia is found in 3–4% of people with multiple sclerosis, according to data from seven studies. It has been theorized that this is due to damage to the spinal trigeminal complex. Trigeminal pain has a similar presentation in patients with and without MS.

Postherpetic neuralgia, which occurs after shingles, may cause similar symptoms if the trigeminal nerve is damaged, called Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.

When there is no apparent structural cause, the syndrome is called idiopathic.

==Diagnosis==
Trigeminal neuralgia is diagnosed via the result of neurological and physical tests, as well as the individual&#x27;s medical history. Magnetic resonance angiography can be used to detect vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve and refer patients to surgery.

As with many conditions without clear physical or laboratory diagnosis, TN is often misdiagnosed, and other conditions are also frequently misdiagnosed as TN. A person with TN may see three or four clinicians before a firm diagnosis is made.

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) can present similarly to TN, and differentiating between these conditions can be difficult. Even suspected TN patients who experience brief attacks of sharp pain have had their symptoms resolve after being treated for TMD. TMD pain can also be triggered by movements of the tongue or facial muscles, so TN must be differentiated from masticatory pain by differentiating between the clinical characteristics of deep somatic pain and neuropathic pain. Masticatory pain will not be arrested by a conventional mandibular local anesthetic block. One quick test a dentist might perform is a conventional inferior dental local anesthetic block. If the pain is in the treated branch, the block will not arrest masticatory pain but will alleviate TN pain.

==Management==
There is evidence that points towards the need to quickly treat and diagnose TN. It is thought that the longer a patient has TN, the harder it may be to reverse the neural pathways associated with the pain.

===Medical===
* The anticonvulsant carbamazepine is the first line treatment; second line medications include baclofen, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, topiramate, gabapentin and pregabalin. Uncontrolled trials have suggested that clonazepam and lidocaine may be effective.
* Antidepressant medications, such as amitriptyline have shown good efficacy in treating trigeminal neuralgia, especially if combined with an anti-convulsant drug such as pregabalin.
* There is some evidence that duloxetine can also be used in some cases of neuropathic pain, especially in patients with major depressive disorder as it is an antidepressant. However, it should, by no means, be considered a first line therapy and should only be tried by specialist advice.
* There is controversy around opiate use such as morphine and oxycodone for treatment of TN, with varying evidence on its effectiveness for neuropathic pain. Generally, opioids are considered ineffective against TN and thus should not be prescribed.

===Surgical===
Microvascular decompression provides freedom from pain in about 75% of patients presenting with drug-resistant trigeminal neuralgia. While there may be pain relief after surgery, there is also a risk of adverse effects, such as facial numbness. Percutaneous radiofrequency thermorhizotomy may also be effective as may stereotactic radiosurgery; however the effectiveness decreases with time.

Surgical procedures can be separated into non-destructive and destructive:

====Non-destructive====
* Microvascular decompression – this involves a small incision behind the ear and some bone removal from the area. An incision through the meninges is made to expose the nerve. Any vascular compressions of the nerve are carefully moved and a sponge-like pad is placed between the compression and nerve, stopping unwanted pulsation and allowing myelin sheath healing.

====Destructive====
All destructive procedures will cause facial numbness, post relief, as well as pain relief.
* Percutaneous techniques which all involve a needle or catheter entering the face up to the origin where the nerve splits into three divisions and then damaging this area, purposely, to produce numbness but also stop pain signals. These techniques are proven effective especially in those where other interventions have failed or in those who are medically unfit for surgery such as the elderly.
* Balloon compression – inflation of a balloon at this point causing damage and stopping pain signals.
* Glycerol injection – deposition of a corrosive liquid called glycerol at this point causes damage to the nerve to hinder pain signals.
* Radiofrequency thermocoagulation rhizotomy – application of a heated needle to damage the nerve at this point.
* Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiation therapy that focuses high-power energy on a small area of the body

===Support===
Psychological and social support has found to play a key role in the management of chronic illnesses and chronic pain conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia. Chronic pain can cause constant frustration to an individual as well as to those around them.

==History==

Trigeminal neuralgia was first described by physician John Fothergill and treated surgically by John Murray Carnochan, both of whom were graduates of the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Historically TN has been called &quot;suicide disease&quot; due to studies by the pioneering forefather in neurosurgery Harvey Cushing involving 123 cases of TN during 1896 and 1912. In those studies it produced intense pain, higher rates of suicidal ideation in patients with severe migraines, and links to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders.

==Society and culture==
Some individuals of note with TN include:
* Four-time British Prime Minister William Gladstone is believed to have had the disease.
* Entrepreneur and author Melissa Seymour was diagnosed with TN in 2009 and underwent microvascular decompression surgery in a well documented case covered by magazines and newspapers which helped to raise public awareness of the illness in Australia. Seymour was subsequently made a Patron of the Trigeminal Neuralgia Association of Australia.
* Salman Khan, an Indian film star, was diagnosed with TN in 2011. He underwent surgery in the US.
* All-Ireland winning Gaelic footballer Christy Toye was diagnosed with the condition in 2013. He spent five months in his bedroom at home, returned for the 2014 season and lined out in another All-Ireland final with his team.
* Jim Fitzpatrick – former Member of Parliament (MP) for Poplar and Limehouse – disclosed he had trigeminal neuralgia before undergoing neurosurgery. He has openly discussed his condition at parliamentary meetings and is a prominent figure in the TNA UK charity.
* Jefferson Davis – President of the Confederate States of America
* Charles Sanders Peirce – American philosopher, scientist and father of pragmatism.
* Gloria Steinem – American feminist, journalist, and social and political activist
* Anneli van Rooyen, Afrikaans singer-songwriter popular during the 1980s and 1990s, was diagnosed with atypical trigeminal neuralgia in 2004. During surgical therapy directed at alleviating the condition performed in 2007, Van Rooyen had permanent nerve damage, resulting in her near-complete retirement from performing.
* H.R., singer of hardcore punk band Bad Brains
* Aneeta Prem, British author, human rights campaigner, magistrate and the founder and president of Freedom Charity. Aneeta&#x27;s experience of bilateral TN began in 2010, with severe pain and resulting sleep deprivation. Her condition remained undiagnosed until 2017. MVD Surgery to ameliorate the pain on the right-hand side was performed at UCHL in December 2019.
* Travis Barker, drummer of rock band Blink-182
* Karel Heřmánek, Czech actor.

<text>William Edward Boeing (; October 1, 1881 – September 28, 1956) was an American aviation pioneer. He founded the Pacific Airplane Company in 1916, which was renamed to Boeing a year later. The company is now the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value and among the largest aerospace manufacturers in the world. 

Boeing&#x27;s first design was the Boeing Model 1 (or B &amp; W Seaplane), which first flew in June 1916, a month before the company was founded. He also helped create the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation in 1929 and served as its chairman until its forced breakup in 1934. He received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1934 and was posthumously inducted in to the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1966, ten years after his death.

==Early life==
William Boeing was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Marie M. Ortmann, from Vienna, Austria, and Wilhelm Böing (1846–1890) from Hohenlimburg, Germany. Wilhelm Böing emigrated to the United States in 1868 and initially worked as a laborer. His move to the United States was disliked by his father and he received no financial support. He later made a fortune from North Woods timber lands and iron ore mineral rights on the Mesabi Range of Minnesota, north of Lake Superior.

In 1890, when William was eight, his father died of influenza and his mother soon moved to Europe. Marie enrolled William Jr. and his sister at schools in Switzerland. William attended school in Vevey, Switzerland, and returned to the US for a year of prep school at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. William Boeing&#x27;s mother remarried in 1898 and moved to Virginia. He enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1898, studying in the engineering department of the Sheffield Scientific School, but dropped out in 1903 to go into the lumber business.

==Career==
Boeing moved to Hoquiam, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest. He prospered in the business due to a nationwide construction boom. He was successful in the venture, in part by shipping lumber to the East Coast via the then-new Panama Canal, generating funds that he would later apply to a very different business.

While being president of Greenwood Timber Company, Boeing, who had experimented with boat design, traveled to Seattle. During the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in 1909, he saw a piloted flying machine for the first time and became fascinated with aircraft. In 1910, at the Dominguez Flying Meet, Boeing asked every pilot foreign and domestic if he could go for an airplane ride and was repeatedly denied except for French aviator Louis Paulhan. Boeing waited and Paulhan finished the meet and left, never giving Boeing his ride. 

Boeing took flying lessons at Glenn L. Martin Flying School in Los Angeles and purchased one of Martin&#x27;s planes. Martin pilot James Floyd Smith traveled to Seattle to assemble Boeing&#x27;s new Martin TA hydroaeroplane and continue to teach its owner to fly. Huge crates arrived by train and Smith assembled the plane in a tent hangar erected on the shore of Lake Union. Boeing&#x27;s test pilot, Herb Munter, soon damaged the plane. 

When he was told by Martin that replacement parts would not be available for months, Boeing told his friend, Commander George Conrad Westervelt of the US Navy, &quot;We could build a better plane ourselves and build it faster.&quot; Westervelt agreed. They soon built and flew the B &amp; W Seaplane, an amphibian biplane that had outstanding performance. Boeing decided to go into the aircraft business, using an old boat works on the Duwamish River near Seattle for his factory.
===Founding of Boeing Aircraft===
In 1916, Boeing went into business with George Conrad Westervelt as &quot;B &amp; W&quot; and founded Pacific Aero Products Co. It was headquartered in the former Heath shipyard. The company&#x27;s first plane was the Boeing Model 1 (B &amp; W Seaplane). When America entered the First World War on April 8, 1917, Boeing changed the name to Boeing Airplane Company and obtained orders from the US Navy for 50 planes. At the end of the war, Boeing concentrated on commercial aircraft to service airmail contracts.

===International airmail attempt===
On March 3, 1919, Willam Boeing partnered with Eddie Hubbard to make the first delivery of international airmail to the United States. They flew a Boeing C-700 seaplane for the demonstration trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Seattle&#x27;s Lake Union, carrying a bag of 60 letters from the Canadian post office for delivery in the U.S.

==Boeing family==
In 1921, Boeing married Bertha Marie Potter Paschall (1891–1977). She had previously been married to Nathaniel Paschall, a real estate broker with whom she had two sons, Nathaniel &quot;Nat&quot; Paschall Jr. and Cranston Paschall. The couple had a son of their own, William E. Boeing Jr. (1922–2015). The stepsons went into aviation manufacturing as a career. Nat Paschall was a sales manager for competitor Douglas Aircraft, which later became McDonnell Douglas. Bill Jr. became a private pilot and industrial real estate developer.

Bertha Boeing was the daughter of Howard Cranston Potter and Alice Kershaw Potter. Through her father, she was a descendant of the founders of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons merchant bankers Alexander Brown, James Brown, and Brown&#x27;s son-in-law and partner Howard Potter; and through her mother, the granddaughter of Charles James Kershaw and Mary Leavenworth Kershaw (a descendant of Henry Leavenworth).

==Breakup of Boeing Group==

In 1929, Boeing joined with Frederick Rentschler of Pratt &amp; Whitney to form United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, which was established as a holding company. The new grouping was a vertically integrated company with interests in all aspects of aviation, intending to serve all aviation markets. In a short time, it bought a host of small airlines, merging them with Boeing&#x27;s pioneering airline under a holding company, United Air Lines.

In 1934, the United States government accused William Boeing of monopolistic practices. The same year, the Air Mail Act forced airplane companies to separate flight operations from development and manufacturing. William Boeing divested himself of ownership as his holding company broke up into three separate entities:

* United Aircraft Corporation, holding all of UATC&#x27;s eastern US manufacturing interests (later United Technologies Corporation)
* Boeing Airplane Company, holding all of UATC&#x27;s western US manufacturing interests, which later became simply The Boeing Company
* United Air Lines for flight operations

He began investing most of his time in his horses in 1937. Boeing Airplane Company, though a major manufacturer in a fragmented industry, did not become successful until the beginning of World War II.

==Later life==

Between 1935 and 1944, William Boeing and his wife Bertha set aside a large tract of land north of the Seattle city limits for subdivision, including the future communities of Richmond Beach, Richmond Heights, Innis Arden, Blue Ridge, and Shoreview. The Boeings placed racially restrictive covenants on their land to enforce segregation, forbidding properties from being &quot;sold, conveyed, rented, or leased in whole or in part to any person not of the White or Caucasian race.&quot; Non-whites could occupy a property on the land only if they were employed as a domestic servant &quot;by a person of the White or Caucasian race.&quot;

He spent the remainder of his life in property development and thoroughbred horse breeding. Concerned about the possibility of World War II battles in the Pacific Northwest, he purchased a farm in the countryside east of Seattle, which he dubbed &quot;Aldarra.&quot; The estate remained in the family until most of the land was developed into a golf course residential community in 2001. Several acres, however, remained in the family, including the Boeing&#x27;s own and two smaller houses. His primary residence for most of his life, however, was a mansion in The Highlands community close to Seattle; the William E. Boeing House was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Boeing Creek running near this property bears his name.

On May 14, 1954, William Boeing and his wife Bertha went back to the Boeing Airplane Company to participate in the rollout ceremony for the Boeing 367-80 prototype.

William Boeing died on September 28, 1956, at the age of 74. His ashes were scattered off the coast of British Columbia, where he spent much of his time sailing.

He was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1966.

In 1984, Boeing was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum. The Museum of Flight, in Seattle holds the William E. Boeing Sr. Papers; an archival collection of Boeing&#x27;s textual and photographic materials.

<text>Paul Henry Gebhard. Jr. (July 3, 1917 – July 9, 2015) was an American anthropologist and sexologist. Born in Rocky Ford, Colorado, he earned a BS and a PhD from Harvard in 1940 and 1947, respectively. Between the years 1946 and 1956, Gebhard was a close colleague to sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. It was acknowledged in Gebhard&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary that Kinsey was in fact his mentor and that Gebhard was fascinated when Kinsey first met him and revealed to him that the men&#x27;s room at Grand Central Terminal in New York City was a frequent site for gay cruising.

Following Kinsey&#x27;s death in 1956, Gebhard became the second director of the Kinsey Institute and served in that capacity from 1956 to 1982. In 1953, Gebhard co-authored the second of the two Kinsey Reports, which is known as &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.&quot; He has also claimed that the statistical bias in the data had not materially affected the results of either of the two reports. He joined the Department of Anthropology of Indiana University in 1947, and retired in 1986.

==Biography==
Paul Gebhard was born to Paul Gebhard Sr. and Eva Baker, who worked as an elementary schoolteacher. He married and later divorced Agnes West, and was married to Joan Huntington until her death in 2004. Following a brief illness, Gebhard died near his home in Indiana on July 9, 2015, aged 98. He was survived by three children of his first marriage and two stepchildren from his second.

<text>People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm is the debut studio album by American hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on April 10, 1990, on Jive Records. After forming the Native Tongues collective and collaborating on several projects, A Tribe Called Quest began recording sessions for &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot; in late 1989 at Calliope Studios with completion reached in early 1990. The album&#x27;s laid back production encompassed a diverse range of samples which functioned as a template for the group&#x27;s unorthodox lyrics.

&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; was met with acclaim from professional music critics and the hip hop community on release, and was eventually certified gold in the United States on January 19, 1996. Its recognition has extended over the years as it is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and a central album in alternative hip hop with its unconventional production and lyricism. It is also credited for influencing many artists in both hip hop and R&amp;B. In a commemorative article for &quot;XXL&quot;, Michael Blair wrote that &quot;&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; was immensely groundbreaking, and will eternally maintain its relevance within the culture and construction of hip-hop&quot;.

== Background ==

A Tribe Called Quest formed in Queens, New York, in 1985. After establishing a friendship with hip-hop act Jungle Brothers, both groups formed a collective dubbed Native Tongues, which also included De La Soul.

Several years prior to recording &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;, group member Q-Tip created much of the album&#x27;s production on pause tapes when he was in the 10th grade. He would have his first studio experience while recording with Jungle Brothers on their debut album &quot;Straight out the Jungle&quot; (1988). Although this was a learning experience, he acquired more recording and producing knowledge being present at all of De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot; (1989) sessions. Recording engineer Shane Faber taught Q-Tip how to use equipment such as the E-mu SP-1200 and Akai S950 samplers, and soon-after, renowned producer Large Professor taught him how to use other equipment, for which he would expand upon on &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;.

Initially, record labels would not sign A Tribe Called Quest due to their unconventional image and sound, but took interest after the success of &quot;3 Feet High and Rising&quot;, which featured appearances from Q-Tip. The group hired Kool DJ Red Alert as their manager, and after shopping their demo to several major labels, they signed a contract with Jive Records in 1989.

== Recording ==

Recording for the album began in late 1989, and finished three months later in early 1990, with &quot;Pubic Enemy&quot; and &quot;Bonita Applebum&quot; as the first tracks recorded.

The group chose Calliope Studios as their primary studio, as it was renowned to promote artistic freedom. Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah and Prince Paul with De La Soul and Stetsasonic, were all recording new music in separate rooms while A Tribe Called Quest recorded &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot;. Q-Tip later commented, &quot;It was exciting. We were kinda left to our own devices. It was just a great environment, conductive for creating. We didn&#x27;t have cell phones, we didn&#x27;t have the internet, we didn&#x27;t have a bunch of things to tear at us. When we got to the studio, the specific job was to make music. There was no TV in there. It was all instruments and speakers. It was just music.&quot;

Q-Tip and Ali Shaheed Muhammad would listen to records several seconds at a time, and re-work them in relationship with other records that would fit. Ali played all live instruments, DJ scratches and programming, while Q-Tip handled everything else with production, including sampling and mixing.

Although claiming that &quot;we all helped put the album together&quot;, Q-Tip was the only group member present at every recording session. Group member Phife Dawg later admitted, &quot;I was being ignorant on that first album, that&#x27;s why I was only on a couple of tracks. I was hardly around. I would have rather hung out with my boys on the street and got my hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn&#x27;t even on the contract for the first album. I was thinking me and Jarobi were more like back-ups for Tip and Ali, but Tip and Ali really wanted me to come through and do my thing&quot;.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; has been described as &quot;a celebration of bohemia, psychedelia and vagabondia&quot;, as well as &quot;laid back&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Dennis Hunt described the album as consisting of &quot;mostly happy hip-hop, featuring gently humorous, casual, conversational raps&quot;. Michael Blair from &quot;XXL&quot; wrote that &quot;the innovative production on this album created an optimal platform for the group&#x27;s wildly inventive relationship with their words. From a lyrical standpoint, Tribe was both sophisticated and playful in the same breath&quot;.

Much of the musical landscape on the album consisted of background noises such as a child crying, frogs and Hawaiian strings. The jazz, R&amp;B and rock samples that were used were from artists that most hip-hop producers of the time ignored, or who were unfamiliar with. For the known artists that were sampled, Q-Tip used breaks that were unique for those artists, which turned out to be highly influential for hip-hop production. Ian McCann from &quot;NME&quot; stated &quot;They break beats from anywhere they want... and deliver them in an easy, totally sympathetic setting.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Greg Sandow said the album &quot;has a casual sound, something like laid-back jazz&quot;.

Regarding the album&#x27;s lyrics, Kris Ex from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said &quot;The rhymes here are at once conversational and repressed, the topics concurrently large and small. The lyrics are 25 years old. But were they released today they&#x27;d seem right on time.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Reviewing the album for &quot;NME&quot;, Ian McCann wrote that &quot;A Tribe Called Quest put no feet in the wrong place here. This is not rap, it&#x27;s near perfection&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Greg Sandow commented that on the album, rather than &quot;defining Afrocentric living&quot;, the group &quot;more or less exemplifies it with no fuss at all&quot;. Robert Tanzilo from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that the album &quot;avoids the gimmickry and circus atmosphere&quot; of the group&#x27;s contemporaries, while &quot;focusing solely on the music&quot;. &quot;The Source&quot; gave it the first &quot;five-mic&quot; rating in the magazine&#x27;s history, describing it as a &quot;completely musical and spiritual approach to hip-hop&quot;, as well as &quot;a voyage to the land of positive vibrations, and each cut is a new experience&quot;.

Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Dennis Hunt called the album &quot;fascinating&quot; and wrote &quot;These songs lope along in a quirkly, jazz-like pace. They&#x27;re intriguingly non-linear and quite provocative, even though their meaning is somewhat elusive&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau said that the album, while &quot;subtler than... necessary&quot; at points, is &quot;indubitably progressive&quot; and &quot;has more good songs on it than any neutral observer will believe without trying&quot;. Chuck Eddy from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was more critical, finding that &quot;the real pleasure on &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; comes from a detailed mesh of instruments and incidental sounds&quot;, and that &quot;the rappers of A Tribe Called Quest tend to mumble in understated monotones that feel self-satisfied, even bored&quot;.

=== Retrospect ===
John Bush of AllMusic said &quot;Restless and ceaselessly imaginative, Tribe perhaps experimented too much on their debut, but they succeeded at much of it, certainly enough to show much promise as a new decade dawned&quot;. Thomas Golianopoulos of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that &quot;following in the ground-breaking footsteps of their Native Tongues brethren, Tribe&#x27;s laid-back debut had no heavy handed political or battle raps, just youthful exuberance and playfully goofy lyrics&quot;. Praising its production and lyricism, Kris Ex, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, credited the album for showcasing the group as &quot;whimsical yet grounded in reality&quot; with its &quot;clean and focused&quot; quality. He went on to write that &quot;all these many years later &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; is more than a nostalgia artifact. It&#x27;s a worthy listen, not because of what it was, but because of what it is&quot;. Dave Heaton of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called the album &quot;brilliant&quot; and said it was &quot;an introduction to Q-Tip&#x27;s talent.&quot; In his 5th edition of &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin rated the album three stars and called it &quot;eclectic and self-consciously jokey&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
Since its release, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; has been included on numerous &quot;best of&quot; lists compiled by music writers and journalists.
== Legacy ==

&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; has been recognized for widening hip-hop&#x27;s vocabulary, as well as instrumentation and samples within hip-hop music. It has also been recognized for influencing a wide range of acclaimed hip-hop and R&amp;B artists, including Common, D&#x27;Angelo, Digable Planets, Erykah Badu, Fugees, J Dilla, Kendrick Lamar, Mos Def, Outkast, Scarface, and Kanye West. Pharrell Williams stated &quot;I listened to &#x27;Bonita&#x27; everyday. I&#x27;d never heard anything like that in my life. That&#x27;s where I changed&quot;. On another occasion, Williams explained that &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot; &quot;caused a turning point in my life, which made me see that music was art.&quot;

Reviewing the album for AllMusic, John Bush called &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; &quot;the quiet beginning of a revolution in non-commercial hip-hop.&quot; For &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Kris Ex stated that with the album the group &quot;created and refined a template for &#x27;90s hip-hop that was street-astute, worldly, and more inspirational than aspirational&quot;. In a commemorative article for &quot;XXL&quot;, Michael Blair wrote &quot;What A Tribe Called Quest ultimately became the pioneers of, and was on full display throughout the production on their debut album, was a certain proficiency in illustrating and honoring a diverse array of genres that preceded them. In what is mostly attributed to Q-Tip&#x27;s deep appreciation and understanding of those definitive genres, Tribe&#x27;s sound was perpetually laced with elements of Jazz, Soul, R&amp;B, and Funk&quot;. Blair concluded that &quot;&quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot; was immensely groundbreaking, and will eternally maintain its relevance within the culture and construction of hip-hop.&quot;

Hip-hop journalist Harry Allen described the album as a turning point in hip-hop where artists did not have to be &quot;tough&quot;. A Tribe Called Quest member Ali Shaheed Muhammad further elaborated that &quot;LL Cool J, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, N.W.A, even Public Enemy, had a tough guy image. It was this bravado at the time that all the hip-hop artists had. &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot; wasn&#x27;t any of that. We weren&#x27;t trying to be tough guys. It was about having fun, being lighthearted, being witty, being poetic. Just being good with one another. That&#x27;s what we presented. Just be. Just exist. Be comfortable in your own skin. &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels&quot; was about celebrating you, whoever you are&quot;.

<text>Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for &quot;&quot; as a henchwoman for the Joker, and debuted in its 22nd episode, &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;, on September 11, 1992. While intended to appear in one episode, Quinn became a recurring character within the DC Animated Universe (DCAU) as the Joker&#x27;s sidekick and love interest, and was adapted into DC Comics&#x27; canon seven years later, beginning with the one-shot &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot; #1 (October 1999). Quinn&#x27;s origin story features her as a former psychologist at Gotham City&#x27;s Arkham Asylum who was manipulated by and fell in love with the Joker, her patient, eventually becoming his accomplice and lover. The character&#x27;s alias is a play on the stock character Harlequin from the 16th-century Italian theater .

Following her introduction to the comics in 1999, Harley Quinn was depicted as the former doctor turned sidekick and lover of the Joker as well as the criminal associate and best friend of Poison Ivy. Later stories depicted Quinn as an independent supervillain who has left her abusive and codependent relationship with the Joker behind, beginning with the publication of her ongoing series, &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;. After years of scarce appearances in comics, Quinn returned in a leading role in 2009 with the &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; series, as part of an unstable alliance with Poison Ivy and Catwoman. The character’s design was modernised in 2011 for DC&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; line-wide relaunch, with the character since regularly featuring as an antihero in the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; and ‘’Birds of Prey’’ team books. Other changes included fronting her own light-hearted Harley Quinn comic book and being established in a new romantic relationship with Poison Ivy. In 2021, DC&#x27;s line-wide &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; relaunch brought Quinn back to Gotham City and reestablished her as a superhero seeking redemption for her past actions.

Harley Quinn&#x27;s abilities include expert gymnastic skills, proficiency in weapons and hand-to-hand combat, complete unpredictability, immunity to toxins, and enhanced strength, agility, and durability. Quinn often wields clown-themed gag weapons, with an oversized mallet being her signature weapon. Additionally, she has a pair of pet hyenas, Bud and Lou, who sometimes serve as her attack dogs.

Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics&#x27; most popular and profitable characters. She has been featured in many of DC&#x27;s comic books and adapted in various other media and merchandise. DC Comics Publisher Jim Lee considers Harley Quinn the fourth pillar of DC Comics&#x27; publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.

Originally voiced by Arleen Sorkin in the DC Animated Universe, she has since appeared in many other DC projects voiced by actresses such as Tara Strong, Hynden Walch, Laura Bailey, Jenny Slate, Melissa Rauch, Laura Post, and Kaley Cuoco. Cuoco provided the character&#x27;s voice in the 2019 animated series &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;. Mia Sara, Margot Robbie, and Lady Gaga have portrayed the character in live action media.
==History==
===Creation and development===

Harley Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for the 1992 &quot;&quot; episode entitled &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot; while Dini was writing the episode. Initially written as an animated equivalent of a walk-on role, Harley Quinn was intended to appear in just one episode. With this, her origin was not supposed to be more than it was, making her popularity unexpected and a surprise success. As Dini was putting together the story for the episode, he wanted to introduce a foil for the supervillain the Joker that would emphasize the Joker&#x27;s comic book personality traits: funny, scary, and egotistical. He then thought of giving Joker a henchwoman, inspired by the molls of the 1960s live-action &quot;Batman&quot; series, and then decided she would be a &quot;funny counterpart to the Joker to maybe work up a little Punch and Judy attitude between them&quot;; Dini stated, &quot;[...] she could crack a joke and the henchmen would laugh, and the Joker would kind of glare at her&quot;. The character idea dated back in 1991, when Dini witnessed his college friend Arleen Sorkin play a jester in an episode of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Dini then based Harley Quinn on Sorkin, incorporating aspects such as her mannerisms and &quot;snappy, wisecracking, bubbly blonde&quot; personality. Dini even decided to have Sorkin voice her. In recording Harley Quinn&#x27;s voice, Sorkin spoke in her normal New York accent while putting in a &quot;little Yiddish sound&quot;, since Dini made the character Jewish, another aspect of the character borrowed from Sorkin; Dini described her voice for the character as having &quot;a snappy blonde but also kind of a bad girl&quot;: &quot;a little bit of Adelaide from &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, a little bit of Judy Holliday&quot;, and &quot;a lot of Arleen&quot;, stating that it sounded &quot;very close&quot; to Sorkin&#x27;s voice.

Dini had several names in mind while naming the character, such as Columbine, and eventually settled on the name &quot;Harley Quinn&quot;. Dini chose the name for the character to be in line with other Batman characters&#x27;s names being puns, and also because he thought &quot;Harley was a fun name for a girl&quot;. The name Harley Quinn is a play on Harlequin, a stock character from the sixteenth-century Italian physical comedy theater .

In designing the character, Timm did a &quot;simplified supervillain version&quot; of traditional Harlequin gear; from the original, he took the jester hat, ruffled collar, diamond pattern, and domino mask and put them on a red-and-black bodysuit, on which the diamonds were strategically placed for easier animation. Timm took Harley Quinn&#x27;s red and black color scheme from the Golden Age comic book character Daredevil. Dini had previously made a rough design for the character, which Timm improved on.

===Expanded role===
After seeing Harley Quinn in the rough cut of &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;, the producers of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, which include Dini and Timm, were impressed with the result, with Dini wanting to bring the character back for more episodes. Timm and another producer, Alan Burnett, were initially reluctant of this and thought that giving Joker a girlfriend &quot;played more towards his comedic side&quot; and would &quot;humanize him too much&quot;, which contrasted their vision for Joker as a character who is &quot;as serious a threat as possible to Batman&quot;. Nevertheless, months after &quot;Joker&#x27;s Favor&quot;, Harley made a second appearance on the show in the episode &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot; and became the Joker&#x27;s love interest. Harley Quinn gained popularity with fans of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, with the character being featured more on the show and eventually starring in her own episodes, such as 1993&#x27;s &quot;Harley and Ivy&quot;, which introduced a friendship between her and fellow supervillain Poison Ivy, and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Harlequinade&quot; and &quot;Harley&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, which explored her life without the Joker. Harley Quinn then became a recurring character in the DC Animated Universe, appearing in &quot;The Animated Series&quot; sequel &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, the direct-to-video film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;, and in non-Batman animation such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and &quot;Justice League&quot;. In February 1994, she made her first appearance in a video game in &quot;The Adventures of Batman and Robin&quot;, an action platformer based on &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;.

===Transition to comic books===
Because of her popularity, Harley Quinn was adapted into DC&#x27;s comic books. In September 1993 (cover date), a year following Harley Quinn&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, the character made her comic book debut in the 12th issue of &quot;The Batman Adventures&quot;, a series set in the universe of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, and became a regular character. In 1997, she appeared in the story &quot;&quot;, released under &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, a DC Comics imprint that published out-of-continuity alternate reality stories, as Hayley Fitzpatrick. In 1999, she became a canonical character with the release of &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;.

====Origin story====
In February 1994, the one-shot &quot;The Batman Adventures: Mad Love&quot; recounting Harley&#x27;s origin was released. Written by Dini and drawn by Timm, the story marks their first comic book collaboration. &quot;Mad Love&quot; introduces Harley Quinn as a former psychologist named Harleen Quinzel who fell in love with the Joker during her internship at Gotham City&#x27;s Arkham Asylum and details her transformation into the Joker&#x27;s villainous accomplice Harley Quinn, as well as the Joker&#x27;s lack of respect for Harley. Widely considered the definitive Harley Quinn story, &quot;Mad Love&quot; added dimensions to the character, with Dini introducing Harley Quinn&#x27;s motivations as well as establishing her as a tragic and sympathetic figure. The story received wide praise and won the Eisner and Harvey awards for Best Single Issue in the same year and was later adapted into an episode of the same name in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; in 1999.

====Name origin====
&quot;Mad Love&quot; establishes Harley Quinn&#x27;s full name to be Harleen Frances Quinzel. &quot;Harleen Frances&quot; was taken from Sorkin&#x27;s first and middle name, Arleen Frances, while &quot;Quinzel&quot; came from one of Dini&#x27;s former Emerson College instructors, who was surnamed Quenzel.

====Introduction to mainstream DC continuity====
Harley Quinn was adapted into the mainstream DC Universe with the 1999 one-shot graphic novel &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;, written by Dini and illustrated by Yvel Guichet, which put her origin in the middle of the &quot;&quot; story line. Dini changed Harley and the Joker&#x27;s relationship to be darker to match the Joker&#x27;s character in the comics; in the story, the Joker attempts to kill Harley at the first opportunity. Harley&#x27;s immunity to toxins and enhanced strength and agility, which were gained from a special formula created by Poison Ivy, were carried over from &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, with Dini stating that they would give her a sort of &quot;physical edge&quot; over Batman and other heroes.

===First ongoing series===

While pursuing new assignments at DC Comics&#x27; offices in New York City, Karl Kesel was approached by former DC editor Matt Idelson to create a pitch for Harley Quinn&#x27;s first ongoing series, which Kesel accepted, being a fan of the character after having read &quot;Mad Love&quot;. Kesel chose Terry Dodson as the artist for the series, whose art Kesel thought complemented the character&#x27;s cartoonish roots and worldview. Kesel called Dodson and asked him if he was interested on working on the comic, to which Dodson agreed, and the two worked for a month on their proposal for the series, which was to make a comic about &quot;love gone horribly, terribly wrong&quot;. The proposal was accepted by DC Comics, and the pair began work on the series, with Kesel and Dodson both being involved in the storytelling, and Dodson bringing in his wife, Rachel Dodson, to ink. Kesel&#x27;s run on the series began being published in December 2000, and was about Harley Quinn leaving the Joker and becoming a solo criminal, alongside a supporting cast of henchmen named the Quinntets. Because of underwhelming sales, his 25-issue run ended in December 2002, and DC decided to change the creative team; the series was given to writer A.J. Lieberman and artists Mike Huddleston and Troy Nixey by Idelson, and took on a grittier and darker direction, contrasting Kesel&#x27;s run. The decision renewed interest in the character, but the sales remained lackluster and the series was cancelled in 2003.

===&quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;===

After years of scarce appearances in comics, Harley Quinn resurfaced in a leading role in July 2009 with &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;, a team-up title created by Dini. The series brought together Batman&#x27;s most popular female villains, Harley Quinn, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy, in an unstable alliance. The series also expanded on Harley Quinn&#x27;s background and early life; in &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; #7, Dini established the character&#x27;s hometown being Brooklyn, based on her accent and also introduced her dysfunctional family, with her swindling father being described as the main reason for her pursuing psychology.

The first several issues of &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; were written by Dini and illustrated by Guillem March. Other creatives who worked for the series include writers Tony Bedard and Peter Calloway, and artists David López, Andres Guinaldo, Peter Nguyen, Jeremy Haun, and Ramon Bachs. The series was cancelled in August 2011 for &quot;The New 52&quot;, DC Comics&#x27; relaunch of their entire comic line.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
====&quot;Suicide Squad&quot;====
As part of the &quot;New 52&quot; reboot in September 2011, Harley Quinn was reintroduced by Adam Glass as a prominent member of the supervillain team Task Force X in the relaunched &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series. The character was heavily redesigned to fit the tone of the book, and was inspired by Harley&#x27;s designs in the video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;; her color motif was changed to red and blue, her jester costume was replaced with a revealing ensemble consisting of a corset and hot pants, her skin was bleached white, and her previously blonde hair was altered to half-blue and half-red. Her personality had also been depicted to be more violent and psychopathic than her former iteration.

In the series, Glass separated Harley Quinn from the Joker and explored her &quot;becom[ing] her own person&quot;, with the Suicide Squad becoming a family to her; Glass said: &quot;Harley&#x27;s always wanted to belong to something. And if not Joker, then the team – and she&#x27;s finding herself in all this. She&#x27;s finding her place in the world, that she&#x27;s not just a sidekick&quot;.

&quot;Suicide Squad&quot; was canceled in April 2014 to coincide with the conclusion of the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline.

====New origin====
In the seventh issue of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, Glass revised Harley Quinn&#x27;s origin story, making it reflect the Joker&#x27;s origins. In the story, the Joker takes Harleen Quinzel to the chemical plant where he originated and pushes her into a vat of chemicals against her will, which bleaches her skin and drives her insane, resulting in her transformation to Harley Quinn. This origin was received negatively by fans, who felt that its removal of Harley Quinn&#x27;s choice to become the Joker&#x27;s accomplice willingly, as depicted in her previous origin stories, took out an essential part of her character.

====Second ongoing series====

Harley Quinn&#x27;s second ongoing series, written by husband and wife Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner, with the interior art illustrated by Chad Hardin and John Timms, explored Harley Quinn leaving Gotham City and starting her own life in her hometown of Brooklyn, depicting her as a landlord in Coney Island, where she shares an apartment building with a supporting cast of &quot;sideshow freaks&quot;. Considered to be the most defining writers to work on the character since Dini and Timm, Palmiotti and Conner reinvented Harley Quinn as an antihero who has left her controlling relationship with the Joker behind.

In contrast to Harley Quinn&#x27;s depiction in Glass&#x27; &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, Palmiotti and Conner wrote Harley Quinn with a lighthearted, cartoonish, and humorous tone. Her costume has also been changed with a roller derby-inspired costume designed by Conner, which incorporates Conner&#x27;s favorite aspects of Harley Quinn&#x27;s early costume and her costume in Glass&#x27; run of &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. The series also brought back Harley Quinn&#x27;s red and black motif.

The series began being published in November 2013, starting with &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; #0, which brought together 17 comic book artists, including Harley Quinn co-creator Bruce Timm, to illustrate a fourth wall-breaking story about Harley thinking of the artists that could illustrate her in her own comic book series. The rest of the series details Harley Quinn&#x27;s adventures in Coney Island with her supporting cast. In &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; #25, Palmiotti and Conner reunited Harley Quinn with the Joker; the story depicts Harley Quinn returning to Gotham City to confront the Joker and end their relationship.

With Harley Quinn&#x27;s longtime friend Poison Ivy being a recurring character in the series, Palmiotti and Conner built on their relationship and hinted at romantic feelings between the two characters; Poison Ivy is shown kissing Harley Quinn multiple times throughout the series, and a sexual relationship between them was alluded to in issue #25. When asked regarding their relationship in a Twitter Q&amp;A, Palmiotti and Conner replied: &quot;Yes, they are girlfriends without the jealousy of monogamy&quot;.

The &quot;New 52&quot; &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; series received positive reception, and was also one of DC Comics&#x27; top-selling series, inspiring multiple spin-offs. The series was ended for the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch of DC&#x27;s titles.

====Controversies====
The cover of the first issue of the &quot;New 52&quot;″s &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; title drew controversy for its sexual depiction of Harley Quinn. This also caused some fans of the character to send Adam Glass hate mail and personal threats.

In September 2013, DC Comics announced an art contest entitled &quot;Break into comics with Harley Quinn!&quot;, in which contestants were to draw Harley in one of four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to National Suicide Prevention Week, but also because of the sexualized portrayal of Harley Quinn in the fourth scenario, in which the character attempts suicide while naked in her bathtub, which was highly criticised. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Psychiatric Association, and National Alliance on Mental Illness all responded to the controversy in an emailed group statement to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;: &quot;We are disappointed that DC Comics has decided to host a contest looking for artists to develop ways to depict suicide attempts by one of its main villains – Harley Quinn&quot;. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC Comics apologized, saying they should have made it clear it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bathtub scene was cut and replaced with Harley Quinn sitting on a rocket while flying in space.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics&#x27; entire line of comic book titles. Both &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; as well as &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; were rebooted, with the latter starting with the one-shot issue &quot;Suicide Squad: Rebirth&quot; #1 (October 2016). Harley Quinn&#x27;s &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; design included pink and blue dyed hair tips and a jacket inspired by Margot Robbie&#x27;s portrayal of the character in the 2016 film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, a change established in the last issues of her &quot;New 52&quot; series.

Harley Quinn returned as a regular character in the relaunched &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; series, written by Rob Williams. The series was canceled in January 2019.

Harley Quinn&#x27;s relaunched ongoing series is a direct continuation of the former, with Conner and Palmiotti still writing for the character, and Hardin and Timms illustrating the interior art. After having written 64 issues of Harley Quinn&#x27;s ongoing series, Conner and Palmiotti&#x27;s five-year run ended with the 34th issue of the series in December 2017, with writer Frank Tieri and artist Inaki Miranda taking over the title. Tieri&#x27;s run on the series ended with the series&#x27; 42nd issue, followed by a two-issue storyline written by Christopher Sebela and illustrated by Mirka Andolfo. By issue #45 in July 2018, Sam Humphries was the new writer for the series, with John Timms returning to provide art. The series ended in August 2020.

====&quot;Harley Loves Joker&quot;====
In 2017, Harley Quinn co-creator Paul Dini wrote a backup feature for Harley Quinn&#x27;s &quot;Rebirth&quot; monthly series entitled &quot;Harley Loves Joker&quot;, co-written by Palmiotti and illustrated by Bret Blevins, which ran for 9 issues. The story brought back Harley Quinn&#x27;s classic characterization and focuses on her past with the Joker. Unlike her characterization in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;, Dini and Palmiotti wrote Harley Quinn in the story as less of a &quot;&quot;, with Harley Quinn and Joker being on equal footing in their relationship. The story concluded with the two-part limited series of the same name, which also expanded on Harley Quinn&#x27;s past as a former intern in animal research at S.T.A.R. Labs, where she met her pet hyenas Bud and Lou. In the second part of the story, Dini and Palmiotti explained Harley Quinn&#x27;s change in costume, establishing the character&#x27;s modern design as a reflection of her having left her relationship with the Joker.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;===

For the 2021 &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; relaunch, Harley Quinn is moved back to Gotham City as a superheroine, where she frequently interacts with and aids the Batman family, and she is given a new design by Riley Rossmo. Harley Quinn&#x27;s fourth ongoing series, written by Stephanie Phillips and illustrated by Rossmo, depicts her &quot;actively looking to make up for her past sins&quot;, alongside a former Joker henchman named Kevin. Harley Quinn also has a prominent role in the &quot;Fear State&quot; crossover event.

In January 2022, Phillips confirmed Harley would be resuming her previous career as a psychologist.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Harley Quinn possesses multiple superhuman abilities, having won a gymnastics scholarship at Gotham City&#x27;s Gotham State University. Following her transition to the main DC canon in 1999, Harley Quinn was established as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, which she received after having been injected with a serum concocted by Poison Ivy. &quot;Vengeance Unlimited, Part Five&quot; (&quot;Harley Quinn&quot; vol. 1 #30) revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater.

Harley Quinn is skilled in using various weapons, often employing weaponized clown-themed gag items, including pop guns, rubber chickens, and a gun that shoots a boxing glove, as well as oversized pistols and mallets, the latter being her signature weapon. Other weapons she uses include: unconventional weapons, such as a baseball bat; explosive weapons such as bazookas, customized bombs, and dynamites; firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and machine guns; Harley Quinn also has a pair of pet hyenas, Bud and Lou, which she can order to attack her opponents.

Despite being mentally unstable and sometimes distracted, Harley is highly intelligent. Her intellect extends to her psychological, tactical and deception abilities, but she does not stand out for particular strategic or scientific skills and often remains subordinate to the Joker, who between the two is the genius and the inventor. Harleen Quinzel earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology and as a former Arkham psychologist, was highly qualified in psychoanalysis, criminology, and forensic psychiatry. While not on par with Joker, she is still an expert tactician, deceiver and escapologist, and still shows traces of her psychological experience. Harley Quinn is the only person besides the Joker to concoct Joker Venom, the Joker&#x27;s signature weapon, and is shown to have reverse-engineered its formula and developed an antitoxin. She also has an indomitable pathological will.

Just like Poison Ivy, sometimes and not as much, Harley uses her feminine charm to attract men but only to manipulate them. Unlike the Joker, she is able to simulate sanity, thus being able to pretend to be a &quot;normal&quot; person. In this way, she disguised herself as a security guard, a lawyer and even Poison Ivy and Batgirl.

==Romantic interests==
Harley Quinn has had several love interests, the most notable being the Joker and Poison Ivy. Other love interests include Mason Macabre, a character created by Conner and Palmiotti. Plastic Man was initially intended to be a love interest for Harley Quinn by Kesel, but was not approved by DC.

===The Joker===
The Joker is Harley Quinn&#x27;s former lover. Harley&#x27;s solo comics often explore her former association with the Joker through &quot;flashbacks of their past exploits, present-day conflicts&quot;, or through Harley as she &quot;laments his absence&quot;. Harley often refers to him as &quot;Mistah J&quot; and &quot;Puddin&#x27;&quot;.

Their relationship is known for its abusive and codependent nature, first established in Harley&#x27;s first origin story &quot;Mad Love&quot;. The Joker habitually abuses Harley, and despite the abuse, Harley Quinn returns to him. In the 1999 one-shot comic &quot;Batman: Harley Quinn&quot;, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Dini describes their relationship as abusive, and empathizes with Harley&#x27;s feelings of abandonment, with Dini basing most of Harley&#x27;s dialogue on his past experiences.

The Joker&#x27;s controlling and codependent relationship with Harley Quinn has been analyzed as a means of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman. Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try to subject her to his control. When Harley successfully defeats Batman in &quot;Mad Love&quot;, the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will think of him; however, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers, which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.

===Poison Ivy===
Poison Ivy is Harley Quinn&#x27;s current love interest and best friend, and Harley often refers to her as &quot;Red&quot;. Ivy was first introduced as a new friend to Harley by Dini in the 1993 &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Harley and Ivy&quot;. The episode came from Dini wanting to make Harley a stronger character and write a story where she leaves the Joker; Dini decided to pair her up with Ivy because she was &quot;the strongest contrast to Harley&quot;. The two later became close friends within the DC Animated Universe. Dini stated that he could see a romantic relationship between the two happening the more he worked with the two characters, but the impossibility of properly portraying their relationship in a kid&#x27;s cartoon at the time prevented it from happening.

Prior to the New 52 reboot, Ivy is shown as having teamed up on occasion with Harley with Harley being her best friend and recurring ally. Unlike most villain team-ups, their partnership is based on genuine friendship and mutual respect. Ivy sincerely wants to save Harley from her unhealthy abusive relationship with the Joker. Accordingly, Poison Ivy despises the Joker, and the two exchange vicious banter at every opportunity. In the final storyline of the &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; series, Harley suggests that Ivy may be in love with her, an accusation that stuns her. The following issue has Poison Ivy acknowledge that she may indeed love Harley, but the details of her love are never specified, and the series ended with the New 52 reboot before their relationship could be addressed.

Conner and Palmiotti hinted at a romantic relationship in the New 52 Harley Quinn series, and later confirmed that Harley and Ivy are in a non-monogamous relationship. 2017&#x27;s Harley Quinn #25 marked their first canonical kiss.

==Character biography==
===DC Animated Universe===

Harley Quinn first appeared in &quot;&quot; (1992–1995), voiced by Arleen Sorkin, who subsequently reprised her role in other DC Animated Universe series, including &quot;&quot; (1996–2000), &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Static Shock&quot; (2000–2004), and &quot;Justice League&quot; (2001–2004), as well as the film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot; (2000).

Originally a career-oriented psychologist, Dr. Harleen Quinzel&#x27;s life took a radical turn when she chose to take an internship at Arkham Asylum for a semester of college. Convinced by the Joker himself to do it, Harleen interviewed him and learned he was abused as a child by his alcoholic father (later learning this backstory to have been one of several different stories he had told to others, some with different details each time), and after more interviews, determined Batman was the primary source of the Joker&#x27;s anger and was to blame for his actions, but that she also had fallen in love with him. Harleen helped the Joker escape and, renaming herself Harley Quinn, became his sidekick in hopes that she could win his love, going on a crime spree across the United States of America.

After assisting Joker in attempting to assassinate Commissioner James Gordon by planting a bomb at a dinner in his honor, she was subdued by Batman, and subsequently an accomplice in virtually all of Joker&#x27;s criminal schemes. On occasion, she would be kicked out of Joker&#x27;s gang when unintentionally upstaging or annoying the Joker, on one of these occasions teaming up with Poison Ivy, with the two becoming close friends and a successful crime duo independently. While imprisoned on her own in Arkham Asylum, Batman offered her a pardon in exchange for helping him track down the Joker after he had stolen a nuclear bomb. The day she is declared rehabilitated and paroled, Harley&#x27;s hyperactivity and unfamiliarity with the &quot;real&quot; world leads to her accidentally kidnapping someone and being returned to Arkham yet again.

In the 31-episode &quot;Gotham Girls&quot; web series, Harley joins forces with Poison Ivy and Catwoman in a co-starring role.

After several failed attempts at rehabilitation, Harley returns to the Joker&#x27;s side. However, after another failed attempt to kill Commissioner Gordon leads the Joker to forget their anniversary, Harley re-examines her life and decides that as Batman was the cause of the Joker&#x27;s obsession, she should capture and kill him herself, doing so by falsely pretending to have found sanity and luring Batman into a trap. Recognizing Harley to have come closer to killing him than Joker has ever done, Batman tricks her into facilitating his escape by making her call the Joker and tell him what she has done, knowing that he would not allow anyone other than himself to kill Batman, pushing her aside and unknowingly knocking her out a window. Recovering in Arkham, Harley decides that the Joker will never truly love her, before returning to her devotion upon seeing that he has left her a rose in a vase by her bedside table, with a note hoping that she gets better soon. Harley later references having convinced the Joker to attend couple&#x27;s counseling with her.

In the film &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot;, flashbacks reveal Harley&#x27;s apparent final actions after returning to the Joker again were assisting him in kidnapping Tim Drake and torturing him into insanity to transform him into their son &quot;J.J&quot;, so that they can start a family together. She later fought Batgirl who angrily chastised her for even helping Joker commit a heinous act but fell deep into an abyss, leading to the latter presuming her dead, though she survived as depicted in the present, where she appears at the end of the film, revealed to have reformed and become the grandmother of the Jokerz members, the Dee Dee Twins, who address her as &quot;Nana Harley&quot;.

===DC Universe===
Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist at Arkham Asylum, and after meeting the Joker, she became his frequent accomplice, took on the name Harley Quinn, and got into an abusive codependent relationship with him. She eventually splits up with him, and becomes a solo criminal, forming a criminal gang called the Quinntets. Following the Quinntet&#x27;s dissolution, Harley Quinn moves to Metropolis with her best friend Poison Ivy, where she works as a love columnist in the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; under the alias Holly Chance. She then moves back to Gotham City, where she then voluntarily incarcerates herself in Arkham. Harley Quinn then spends a year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham&#x27;s medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female Ventriloquist, who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and Commissioner Jim Gordon foil the impostor&#x27;s plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley&#x27;s effort at redemption and agrees with granting her parole. She then briefly joins the Secret Six, then decides to quit.

====&quot;Final Crisis&quot;====
During &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, a reformed Harley Quinn resides in an Amazon-run women&#x27;s shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian stola or chiton. She befriends the former Catwoman replacement Holly Robinson and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to Themiscyra by &quot;Athena&quot; (really Granny Goodness) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena and encounter Mary Marvel. The group reveals Granny&#x27;s deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to Apokolips. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by Thalia as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to Gotham City.

====&quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;====

Harley Quinn then joins forces with Poison Ivy (Pamela Isley) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle) in the series &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot;. In &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in her hometown of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, during the holiday season. Harley&#x27;s father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the &quot;villain and hero stuff&quot;. The dysfunctional, &quot;horrible&quot; experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens&#x27; shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together. Following several adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum, intending to kill the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release the Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates. Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle. Shortly afterward, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley&#x27;s cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps her kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman. During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says she saw good in them and only wanted to help. As Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.

====&quot;The New 52&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;====
Like her previous incarnations, Harleen Quinzel was still the Joker&#x27;s psychologist, but before she becomes Harley, the Joker pushes her into a vat of chemicals, bleaching her skin white and driving her insane. Harley Quinn is forced to join the Suicide Squad by Amanda Waller. Harley Quinn then leaves Gotham City and moves back to her hometown of Brooklyn and resides in Coney Island.

====&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;====
Harley Quinn moves back to Gotham City in an attempt to reestablish herself as a hero, aiding the Batman Family and trying to make up for her past &quot;where she often enabled the Joker&quot;.

==Cultural impact==

Harley Quinn has become one of DC Comics&#x27;s most popular characters. The 2016 relaunch of her comic shipped more copies than any other &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; title and was one of the best-selling comics of the year. DC Comics Publisher Jim Lee refers to Harley Quinn as the fourth pillar in their publishing line, behind Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Harley Quinn currently stars in four separate ongoing series — three eponymous titles and &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. Only Batman and Superman have comparable numbers of monthly appearances, making Harley Quinn the most prominent and profitable female character. Kevin Kiniry, vice-president of DC Collectibles, says Harley Quinn is always a top-seller and she &quot;can go toe-to-toe with Batman and the Joker as one of the most fan-requested and sought-after characters&quot;. In 2016, Harley Quinn&#x27;s Halloween costume ranked as the most popular costume in both the United States and the United Kingdom and it remains a popular subject for cosplay. To celebrate the character, DC Comics declared the month of February to be Harley Quinn Month and published 22 Harley Quinn variant covers across their line of comic books. IGN&#x27;s 2009 list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Harley Quinn as #45. She was ranked 16th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;″s 2011 &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list. Joker voice actor Mark Hamill attributes the success of Harley Quinn to Sorkin&#x27;s performance in &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot;. On Twitter, he stated: &quot;In the script she was just an unnamed Joker &quot;hench-wench&quot; [with] no discernible personality. When [Sorkin] began reading her lines in that unforgettable voice so poignant [and] full of heart I nearly fell off my chair! She brought SO much more than was on the page [and] a legend was born&quot;.

She&#x27;s not totally the animated version, and it&#x27;s not totally the Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner version, but it kind of borrows from all of them and creates its own reality and its own fun. There are so many moments in that movie that I just think are wonderful. [...] When I saw her running, laughing hysterically, pushing a shopping cart full of Peeps, I said, &quot;That&#x27;s my girl&quot;. All those little impish things that she did in the movie – sitting down eating cereal, watching Tweety Bird cartoons, and just kind of skipping through life cheerfully oblivious of the devastation she&#x27;s caused – that&#x27;s Harley&quot;.

* Harley Quinn appears as a playable character in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, with Tara Strong reprising her role.

====&quot;Batman: The Enemy Within&quot;====
Harley Quinn appears in &quot;&quot; (the sequel to &quot;&quot;), voiced by Laura Post. This version was driven insane following her father&#x27;s long bout with mental illness and eventual suicide. Attempting to avoid her father&#x27;s fate, she joins a criminal organization called the Pact to steal a virus able to cure her hereditary condition. This depiction initially reverses the dynamic between Harley and the Joker. Quinn manipulates and abuses her former patient at Arkham Asylum, named &quot;John Doe&quot;, who is infatuated with her. As the series progresses, John&#x27;s confidence will increase, and depending on the player&#x27;s choices, he will either aid Bruce Wayne in capturing Quinn or transform into the traditional version of the Joker. In the latter outcome, Harley becomes the Joker&#x27;s girlfriend, and the two use the virus to threaten Gotham City.

<doc id="311905" wikidata="Q384193" url="?curid=311905" title="Penguin (character)">
<text>The Penguin (Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman. The character made his first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #58 (December 1941) and was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. The Penguin is one of Batman&#x27;s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery. The Penguin has repeatedly been named one of the best Batman villains and one of the greatest villains in comics. The Penguin was ranked #51 in IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time.

The Penguin is a Gotham City mobster who fancies himself the number one &quot;Gentleman of Crime&quot;. He is most often seen as a short, fat man with a long nose who wears a monocle, top hat, and morning suit while carrying his signature umbrella. He also has a cigarette holder in his mouth. The Penguin uses high-tech umbrellas as different tools. His umbrellas have been used as guns, gas, swords/knives, a mini-helicopter and many other unconventional tools. The Penguin owns and runs a nightclub called the Iceberg Lounge which provides a cover for his criminal activity.

Batman sometimes uses the nightclub as a source of criminal underworld information. Unlike most of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery, the Penguin is completely sane and in full control of his actions. According to his creator Bob Kane, the character was inspired by the advertising mascot of Kool cigarettes in the 1940s; a penguin with a top hat and cane. However, similarities have been found between Penguin&#x27;s design and the appearance of the Dick Tracy character Broadway Bates, who was introduced in 1932. Co-creator Bill Finger thought that the image of high-society gentlemen in tuxedos was reminiscent of emperor penguins. His main color is usually purple.

The character has been featured in various media adaptations, including feature films, television series, and video games. His live-action portrayals include Burgess Meredith in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series and its spin-off film, Danny DeVito in the film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, Robin Lord Taylor in the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, and Colin Farrell in the film &quot;The Batman&quot; and a self-titled spinoff series. Paul Williams, Tom Kenny, Nolan North, Wayne Knight, Stephen Root, and Elias Toufexis, among others, have voiced Penguin in animation and video games.
==Publication history==

The Penguin made his first appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #58 (December 1941) and was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. The character is set to receive his first solo title as a part of the Dawn of DC initiative, with the book being written by Tom King and drawn by Rafael de Latorre.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age===

Originally known only by his alias, the Penguin first appeared in Gotham City as a skilled thief, sneaking a pair of priceless paintings (valued at $250,000 in 1941 dollars) out of an art museum by hiding the rolled-up canvases in the handle of his umbrella. The Penguin later used the stolen paintings as proof of his underworld acumen to a local mob boss, who allowed him to join his crime family. With the Penguin&#x27;s planning, the mob pulled off a string of ingenious heists. The &quot;be-monocled bird&quot; and the mobster eventually fell out, leading Cobblepot to kill him with his umbrella gun. The Penguin became the leader of the mob and attempted to neutralize Batman by framing him for the theft of a statue which Penguin, himself, had stolen. As part of the plot, Penguin actually already owned the statue and was framing Batman and Robin to commit insurance fraud. The Penguin&#x27;s plans were eventually prevented, but the bandit himself escaped.

Penguin was later sighted when Dick Grayson was traveling on a train. Batman and Robin found out that he was getting reward money for turning in criminals that he later sprung from prison. While Batman and Robin defeated the criminals during the conflict, Penguin fell into the Mississippi River.

Penguin made his way to Florida where he set up a gambling operation with Joe Crow, Buzzard Benny, and Canary where the patrons would win big and then they would be followed by Penguin&#x27;s henchmen so that they can rob them. Batman and Robin put an end to the gambling operation, but Penguin got away.

Penguin later utilized some exotic birds to assist in his crime spree. Batman and Robin stopped this spree, but Penguin escaped again.

Penguin later set himself up as an underworld advisor where he sold his foolproof plans to different criminals. When the criminals pulled off a successful heist, Penguin would kill them and steal their loot. To get to the bottom of this caper, Batman posed as a rival criminal called &quot;Bad News Brewster&quot;. Despite Penguin realising that Batman was posing as a criminal, Penguin was brought to justice.

Penguin soon became less violent and began to obsess over birds and umbrellas. After breaking out of prison, Penguin heard that Batman didn&#x27;t consider him a threatening villain. To prove Batman wrong, Penguin built himself some gimmick guns and fishing poles. Batman was able to defeat him with an umbrella.

Penguin later escaped from prison and tried to rob three eccentric millionaires. While Batman and Robin failed to catch him after the first two robberies, succeeded during the third due to the fact that the third millionaire has been dead for a year.

Penguin later escaped from prison. To catch him, Batman and Robin set up an umbrella repair shop. Despite some difficulties, Batman and Robin were finally able to catch Penguin when he tripped over an umbrella.

Penguin later met Joker in prison. After escaping, Penguin and Joker competed against each other in robberies until they eventually cooperated. Their differences would be the advantage that Batman and Robin would use to apprehend them.

Penguin took the son of a criminal under his wing and started to teach him about crime. The uninterested boy wrote a book about Penguin&#x27;s crimes, impressing Penguin to the point where he plotted to get it published. When that failed, he started to steal some publishing supplies which led to the boy attracting the attention of Batman and Robin. After Batman and Robin apprehended Penguin, the book is shown to the readers that &quot;crime doesn&#x27;t pay&quot;.

Penguin later attempted to extort money from a shipping company by pretending to flash-freeze a member of its board of directors. This plot was foiled when Batman and Robin found that the frozen victims were all dummies. His next plot also failed.

Penguin&#x27;s next crimes included being tricked by three crooks into distracting Batman &amp; Robin, and opening a restaurant called the Penguin&#x27;s Nest as part of a plot to get arrested to collaborate with an incarcerated forger. 

When a fire broke out in prison, Penguin saved the prison warden. He was released on parole and tried to go straight only for him to see a cartoon that depicted and mocked penguins. This sent him into a frenzied spree, until his eventual capture.

Next, Penguin posed as an assistant to a reclusive ornithologist named Professor Boyd where he used his ornithology stage as a front. 

Upon release, Penguin set up his own bird shop where he sold his birds to the prominent people of Gotham City. The birdcages had bombs that would enable Penguin to break into their houses and rob them.

Penguin&#x27;s next plot involved extorting the singers of Gotham City by using special microphones that released a type of gas that affected the singers&#x27; singing abilities, which he held to ransom. 

Penguin&#x27;s next step was to compete with Joker and Catwoman&#x27;s crime waves, with his own involving rare birds. As usual, Penguin was apprehended by Batman once again.

Penguin was then forced to improvise when a thunderbolt destroyed his hideout and trick umbrellas. 

After his arrest, Penguin began to use codes in order to get information on how to break out of prison, but was foiled when Batman obtained his code book.

Penguin broke out of prison and vowed not to use birds in his crime spree. One of those crime sprees caused Penguin to be tripped by birds. When some chicks swallowed some diamonds, he attempts to make off with them only to be apprehended by Batman and Robin.

Upon being released from prison, Penguin started a sideshow attraction called Pee-Wee the Talking Penguin. This was a cover for a scheme to use the penguin costume to commit robberies to obtain the money to pay off his previously hired goons. 

Penguin got out of jail for snitching on the criminal Squeeze Miller which led to Miller&#x27;s execution. He was surprised that Miller listed him in his will. To get the inheritance, Penguin had to commit a specific robbery using specific birds. He was apprehended when it turned out that Miller&#x27;s inheritance was worthless.

After being paroled, he tries to get the Bird Lovers&#x27; Society to elect the penguin the state bird. When that was turned down, Penguin seeks revenge by stealing from the society. 

After yet another arrest and imprisonment, he uses the prison&#x27;s workshop to create mechanical wings and escape from prison. He and his henchmen use the wings to abduct Robin and force Batman to reveal his true identity. Batman rescued Robin and defeated Penguin and his henchmen.

After so many failed attempts, Penguin had difficulty recruiting henchmen. He feigned going straight again and converted a mansion into a museum and bird sanctuary, where he started returning stolen loot to the robbery victims. This turned out to be a plot to plant gas bombs and re-steal the loot.

On Penguin&#x27;s birthday, he received mocking gifts from other criminals.

Penguin is paroled from prison again and was asked to release his birds as a sign of good will. Penguin proceeds to open up his umbrella company called Penguin Umbrellas Inc. where he even fooled Batman into endorsing his products, which contained special magnets. Following the robbery, Penguin fled to Oasis Beach Island in the Caribbean Sea where he attempted another umbrella-themed theft before being apprehended by Batman and Robin.

In his final Golden Age appearance, Penguin pretended to be a legitimate businessman where he sold counterfeit mythological birds. Penguin then claimed that Batman was associated with a Man-Bat of his own design.

=== Silver Age ===
Born Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, the Penguin was bullied as a child for his short stature, weight, way of walking, and beak-like nose. Several stories relate that he was forced, as a child, to always carry an umbrella by his overprotective mother due to his father dying of pneumonia from refusing to take one while going out in the rain. His parents owned a bird shop, where Cobblepot spent most of his time with the birds, seeing them as his only friends, and lavishing them with attention. His love of birds would eventually lead him to study ornithology in college – only to find out that he knew more about birds than most of his professors did. In some versions, Cobblepot turns to crime after his mother dies and the bird shop, along with all of her birds, is repossessed to pay her debts.

Penguin&#x27;s first fight with Batman and Robin occurred when he was behind a series of thefts and left behind eggs as clues. Penguin&#x27;s egg clue proved to be his undoing when he got bitten by a baby alligator that hatched from one of the eggs.

The injury Penguin got from the alligator caused him to briefly retire from crime. After being mocked by other criminals, Penguin began to plague Batman again by committing bird-related crimes. He was foiled by Batman and Robin.

After laying low for a short time, Penguin began his next plot that involved kidnapping a young ruler named King Peeble IV of Swawak in order to take over Swawak. Batman and Robin defeated him with help from Talia al Ghul.

At the time when King Kull plotted to cause havoc on Earth-One, Earth-Two, and Earth-S, he enlists Penguin, Queen Clea of Earth-Two, Blockbuster of Earth-One, and Ibac of Earth-S for his attack on Earth-Two, where he tries to wreck Atlantis and use a cloud to sink islands. They are thwarted by Superman of Earth-One, Wonder Woman of Earth-Two, Green Arrow of Earth-One, and Spy Smasher of Earth-S.

Penguin then did a heist on treasures belonging to short rulers using robot versions of extinct birds to keep Batman busy. Batman managed to apprehend Penguin. Penguin did another little man-motive crime and was apprehended by Batman again.

Penguin later participated in Hugo Strange&#x27;s auction of Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

At the time when the Gotham City council outlawed Batman and Robin, both of them had to work outside the law to apprehend Penguin during his diamond heist.

The Penguin made his last Silver Age appearance during the last appearance of the Earth-One Batman. After he and a multitude of Batman&#x27;s enemies are broken out of Arkham Asylum and Gotham State Penitentiary by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, the Penguin carries out Ra&#x27;s&#x27; plans to kidnap Batman&#x27;s friends and allies. Penguin, Joker, Mad Hatter, Cavalier, Deadshot, and Killer Moth attack Gotham City Police Headquarters, but are infuriated when Joker sabotages their attempt at holding Commissioner James Gordon for ransom. A standoff ensues, with Joker on one side and Penguin and Mad Hatter on the other. The Joker quickly subdues both with a burst of laughing gas from one of his many gadgets.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Following the rebooting the history of the DC Universe, the Penguin was relegated to sporadic appearances, until writer Alan Grant (who had earlier penned the Penguin origin story &quot;The Killing Peck&quot; in &quot;Secret Origins Special&quot; #1) and artist Norm Breyfogle brought him back, deadlier than ever.

In this continuity, Oswald Cobblepot is an outcast in his high-society family and their rejection drives him to become a criminal. In keeping with his aristocratic origins, the Penguin pursues his criminal career while wearing formal attire such as a top hat, monocle, and tuxedo, especially of the &quot;white-tie-and-tails&quot; design. He is one of the relatively few villains in Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery who is sane and in full control of his actions, although still ruthless and capable of extreme violence. He is also highly intelligent and can even match wits with Batman, in some cases using his access to information and business connections to assist the vigilante. Batman once admitted the Penguin is smarter than he is.

During their run, the Penguin forms a brief partnership with hypnotist Mortimer Kadaver, who helps him fake his own death as a ploy to strike an unsuspecting Gotham, only for Kadaver to include a post-hypnotic suggestion that will leave Penguin back in his comatose state and only able to be awoken by a command that Kadaver alone knows. The Penguin later kills Kadaver, after plugging his own ears with toilet paper so that the hypnotist no longer has power over him. After Batman foils this particular endeavor, the Penguin embarks on one of his grandest schemes ever in the three-part story &quot;The Penguin Affair&quot;. Finding Harold Allnut being tormented by two gang members, the Penguin takes in the technologically gifted hunchback, showing him kindness in exchange for services. Harold builds a gadget that allows the Penguin to control flocks of birds from miles away, which the Penguin utilizes to destroy radio communications in Gotham and crash a passenger plane. This endeavor, too, is foiled by Batman, who hires Harold as his mechanic.

The Penguin resurfaces during Jean-Paul Valley&#x27;s tenure as Batman and is one of the few people to deduce that Valley is not the original Caped Crusader. To confirm his theory, he kidnaps Sarah Essen Gordon, places her in a death trap set to go off at midnight, and turns himself in, utilizing the opportunity to mock her husband Commissioner Gordon as midnight approaches. An increasingly infuriated Gordon is nearly driven to throw him off the police headquarters roof before Valley rescues Sarah moments before midnight. As Valley leaves, he says, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing the Penguin can throw at me that I haven&#x27;t encountered before.&quot; The Penguin reluctantly agrees with this sentiment, accepting that he has become passé. Subsequently, the Penguin turns his attentions to a new &quot;modus operandi&quot;, operating behind the front of a legitimate restaurant and casino he calls &quot;The Iceberg Lounge&quot;, which Batman sometimes uses as a source of criminal underworld information. Though he is arrested for criminal activities several times during the course of his &quot;reform&quot;, he always manages to secure a release from prison thanks to his high-priced lawyers.

In the storyline &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, Gotham City is nearly leveled by an earthquake. The Penguin stays behind when the U.S. government blockades the city. He becomes one of the major players in the lawless city, using his connections to profit by trading the money that nobody else in Gotham could use for goods through his contacts outside the city. One of these connections is discovered to be Lex Luthor and his company LexCorp. The Penguin&#x27;s information helps Luthor to gain control of Gotham&#x27;s property records, but Luthor dismisses him when the Penguin attempts to blackmail Luthor.

The Penguin was swept up in the events of &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. In the seventh issue, he is briefly seen as part of the Battle of Metropolis, a multi-character brawl started by Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s Secret Society of Super Villains which he is a member of. The Penguin, along with several other villains, is bowled over at the surprise appearance of Bart Allen.

One Year Later while the Penguin is away from Gotham City, Great White Shark and Tally Man kill many of the villains who had worked for him, and frame the reformed Harvey Dent. The Great White Shark had planned to take over Gotham&#x27;s criminal syndicate and eliminate the competition, the Penguin included. Upon his return to Gotham, the Penguin continues to claim that he has gone straight, and reopens the Iceberg, selling overpriced Penguin merchandise. He urges the Riddler to avoid crime, as their new shady but legal lifestyle is more lucrative.

The Penguin was featured as a prominent figure in &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;. He fights a gang war against Tobias Whale, Intergang and the New Rogues, while supposedly running an &quot;underground railroad&quot; for criminals. In the end, Batman convinces the Penguin to become his informant.

The Penguin later loses Batman&#x27;s support after the latter&#x27;s mysterious disappearance and Intergang&#x27;s exploitation of the return of the Apokoliptian Gods. He appears in &quot;Battle for the Cowl: The Underground&quot;, which depicts the effects of Batman&#x27;s disappearance on his enemies. The Penguin&#x27;s mob is absorbed by Black Mask II, who controls his criminal activities. The Penguin, with the aid of the Mad Hatter, abducts Batman and brainwashes him to assassinate Black Mask.

In &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, the Birds of Prey discover the Penguin beaten and stabbed at the feet of the White Canary. The Birds rescue him and flee to the Iceberg. While recovering, the Penguin expresses his attraction to the Dove. Eventually, the Penguin reveals that his injury had been a ruse and that he is working with the White Canary in exchange for valuable computer files on the superhero community. He betrays the Birds and seriously injures both Lady Blackhawk and the Hawk before the Huntress defeats him. The Huntress tapes him up with the intention of taking him with her, only to be informed by Oracle that she has to let him go due to a police manhunt for the Birds. The Huntress considers killing him with her crossbow, but ultimately leaves him bound and gagged in an alley with the promise that she would exact her vengeance on him later.

The Penguin is eventually attacked by the Secret Six, who kill many of his guards in an ambush at his mansion. Bane informs him that he needs information on Batman&#x27;s partners, as he plans on killing Red Robin, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Azrael. The Penguin soon betrays the team&#x27;s location, which results in the Justice League, the Teen Titans, the Birds of Prey, the Justice Society, and various other heroes hunting down and capturing the criminals. Around this time, a new supervillain, who calls himself the Architect, plants a bomb in the Iceberg Lounge as revenge for crimes committed by the Penguin&#x27;s ancestor. Though Blackbat and Robin are able to evacuate the building, the Lounge is destroyed in the ensuing explosion.

===The New 52===
In 2011, The New 52 rebooted the DC universe. The Penguin is a client of a criminal named Raju who was sent to offer gold to the Dollmaker for Batman&#x27;s release. While in his Iceberg Casino, the Penguin views a disguised Charlotte Rivers on his surveillance cameras and tells his henchwoman Lark to make sure Rivers gets &quot;a story to die for&quot;. In &quot;Death of the Family&quot;, the Penguin puts his right-hand man Ignatius Ogilvy in charge of his operations in his temporary absence. Ogilvy, however, uses the Penguin&#x27;s absence to declare him dead, taking over his gang and killing those loyal to him. Under the alias &quot;Emperor Penguin&quot;, Ogilvy takes over the Penguin&#x27;s operations. Upon the Joker&#x27;s defeat, Batman unsuccessfully attempts to imprison the Penguin in Blackgate Penitentiary, only to be forced to release him later. Upon learning of Ogilvy&#x27;s betrayal, the Penguin attacks his former henchman&#x27;s new empire, but Batman intervenes and arrests him. The Penguin is found not guilty, however, thanks to the machinations of his ally Mr. Combustible threatening the judge&#x27;s family. Meanwhile, Ogilvy releases Kirk Langstrom&#x27;s Man-Bat serum on Gotham City, turning many of the citizens into Man-Bats. Langstrom discovers a cure, returning the citizens to normal. Ogilvy then takes the serum himself which was spiced with the Venom drug and one of Poison Ivy&#x27;s plant concoctions. Emperor Penguin then challenges Batman openly to a fight, defeating the masked vigilante with his newfound prowess and leaving him to be rescued by the Penguin. The pair forge a temporary alliance and defeat Ogilvy.

The Penguin also played a role in the Black Canary&#x27;s rebooted origin. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (vol. 4) #0, Dinah sought to land a job at the Iceberg Lounge, knowing that a lead on the Basilisk organization which she was pursuing would soon spring up there. Unfortunately, the Penguin was not in the habit of taking job applications, so she decided to prove her worth by infiltrating the outfit by herself. When she arrived in the Penguin&#x27;s bathroom, he was unimpressed. To prove her worth, she demonstrated her special ability: a sonic scream that could shake down the roof, if it were intense enough. Naturally, the scream alerted the Penguin&#x27;s henchmen, and she made short work of them with her martial arts skills. Finally impressed, the Penguin hired her, and dubbed her the Black Canary in keeping with the ornithological theme.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, the Penguin is among the villains recruited by the Crime Syndicate of America to join the Secret Society of Super Villains. With the heroes gone, the Penguin becomes the Mayor of Gotham City and divides the different territories among the inmates of Arkham Asylum. Bane retrieves Ignatius Ogilvy (now calling himself &quot;Emperor Blackgate&quot;) for the Penguin as part of their agreement. When Bane brings him to the Penguin, he tells Emperor Blackgate that the Arkham fighters are not scared of Bane as he does not instill fear as Batman did.

===DC Rebirth===
In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, the Penguin is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by the Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. When the Penguin suggests that they hand Moonbow and Typhoon over to the government that supposedly created them, Typhoon attacks Penguin until the Comedian crashes the meeting.

==Characterization==
===Skills and abilities===
The Penguin is a master criminal who aspires to be wealthy, powerful and respected (or at least feared) by Gotham&#x27;s high society. The Penguin&#x27;s wealth gives him access to better resources than most other Batman villains, and he is able to mix with Gotham&#x27;s elite, especially those he plans to target in his future crimes. He is also capable of returning to his luxurious lifestyle very easily despite his violent criminal history and prison record. He has even attempted multiple times to enter the political world, even launching expensive election campaigns. The Penguin also has strong connections with other criminal kingpins across Gotham, allowing him to hire their assassins and workers to spy on them easily. The Penguin relies on cunning wit and intimidation to exploit his surroundings for profit, and despite his short temper, he is normally depicted as being more rational and sane than other Batman villains, or at least relatively so.

Although he often delegates the dirty work to his henchmen, he is not above taking aggressive and lethal actions on his own, especially when provoked or insulted. In spite of his appearance and stature, he is a dangerous hand-to-hand combatant with enough developed skills in judo, fencing, jujutsu and bare-knuckle boxing to overwhelm attackers many times his size and physical bearing. The Penguin is usually portrayed as a capable physical combatant when he feels the situation calls for it, but his level of skill varies widely depending on the author; the character has been written both as a physical match for Batman and as someone the masked vigilante is capable of defeating with a solid punch. His crimes often revolve around stealing valuable bird-related items and his car and other vehicles often have an avian theme.

===Equipment===
The Penguin utilizes an assortment of umbrellas, particularly the Bulgarian umbrella. These usually contain weapons such as machine guns, sword blades, knife blades, rocket launchers, laser blasters, flamethrowers, and acid or poison gas spraying devices fired from the ferrule (however, the Penguin is able to weaponize his umbrellas in an almost unlimited variety of ways). Depending on the writer, some of his umbrellas can carry multiple weapons at once. He often carries an umbrella that can transform its canopy into a series of spinning blades: this can be used as a miniature helicopter or as an offensive weapon; he often uses this to escape a threatening situation. The canopy of the umbrella is sometimes depicted as being a bullet resistant shield, and some are patterned in different ways from a spiral capable of hypnotizing opponents to flashy signs. He can also call upon his flying birds to attack and confuse his enemies in battle.

===Appearance===
The Penguin&#x27;s usual appearance is that of a short, obese human in formal wear. The debut of Tim Burton&#x27;s version of the character featured in the 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot; perverted the Penguin’s traditional guise. In the film, the Penguin&#x27;s hands are flippers (a physical deformity caused by syndactyly), which, combined with a beak-like nose and other characteristics, made the Penguin look like a cross between an actual penguin and a man. This somewhat bizarre aspect inspired comic book artists and has influenced numerous Penguin designs in cartoons since the film&#x27;s release, such as &quot;&quot;. Currently, both the old and the new appearances of the character alternate in the comics, although there is no clear explanation or basis in reality for this to happen.

===Relationships===
The idea of the Penguin and the Joker as a team is one that is decades old, as the two villains, pop-culture wise, are arguably Batman&#x27;s two most famous enemies. Their first team-up took place fairly early in Batman&#x27;s career, in &quot;Knights of Knavery&quot;. Since then, the two have teamed up countless times throughout the Golden and Silver Ages. This carried over into the 1960s television series as well; both appeared together as a team numerous times. They have even shown affection towards each other on more than one occasion; in one story, &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;, the Joker actually cries when it appears that the Penguin has been murdered, and vows to avenge the Penguin&#x27;s death.

==Reception==

The character of the Penguin, particularly as portrayed by Burgess Meredith in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series, has often been used as a theme to mock public figures that supposedly resemble him. Jon Stewart, host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, has made numerous references comparing former Vice President Dick Cheney with the Penguin, including a laugh similar to the one Meredith used. In May 2006, a Republican-led PR firm, DCI Group, created an astroturfing YouTube video satirizing Al Gore&#x27;s film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;. The video portrayed Gore as the Penguin using one of his trick umbrellas to hypnotize a flock of penguins into believing in the existence of global warming and climate change. Roger Stone has also been likened to Penguin due to his manner of dress.

<text>In botany, a pome is a type of fruit produced by flowering plants in the subtribe Malinae of the family Rosaceae. Pome fruits consist of a central &quot;core&quot; containing multiple small seeds, which is enveloped by a tough membrane and surrounded by an edible layer of flesh. Pome fruit trees are deciduous, and undergo a dormant winter period that requires cold temperatures to break dormancy in spring. Well-known pomes include the apple, pear, and quince.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pome&quot; entered English in the late 14th century, and referred to an apple or an apple-shaped object. It derived from the Old French word for &quot;apple&quot;: (12th century; modern French is ), which in turn derived from the Late Latin or Vulgar Latin word &quot;apple&quot;, originally the plural of Latin &quot;fruit&quot;, later &quot;apple&quot;.

== Morphology ==
A pome is an accessory fruit composed of one or more carpels surrounded by accessory tissue. The accessory tissue is interpreted by some specialists as an extension of the receptacle and is then referred to as &quot;fruit cortex&quot;, and by others as a fused hypanthium (floral cup). It is the most edible part of this fruit.

The carpels of a pome are fused within the &quot;core&quot;. Although the epicarp, mesocarp, and endocarp of some other fruit types look very much like the skin, flesh, and core respectively of a pome, they are parts of the carpel (see above diagram). The epicarp and mesocarp of a pome may be fleshy and difficult to distinguish from one another and from the hypanthial tissue. The endocarp forms a leathery or stony case around the seed, and corresponds to what is commonly called the core.
A pome-type fruit with a stony rather than a leathery endocarp may be called a polypyrenous drupe.

The shriveled remains of the sepals, style and stamens can sometimes be seen at the end of a pome opposite the stem, and the ovary is therefore often described as inferior in these flowers.

==Examples==
The best-known example of a pome is the apple. Other examples of plants that produce fruit classified as a pome are &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, &quot;Crataegus&quot; (hawthorn and mayhaw), medlar, pear, &quot;Pyracantha&quot;, quince, rowan, loquat, toyon, and whitebeam.

Some pomes may have a mealy texture (e.g., some apples); others (e.g., &quot;Amelanchier&quot;, &quot;Aronia&quot;) are berry-like with juicy flesh and a core that is not very noticeable.

<text>Crown Prince Dan () was a crown prince of the State of Yan during the Warring States period of ancient China. He was also called Yan Dan ().

He lived in the State of Qin as a hostage, but returned to Yan in 232 BC. He sent Jing Ke to assassinate King Zheng of Qin, who later assumed the title Qin Shi Huang and became the first Emperor of China, but Jing failed. King Xi of Yan, Dan&#x27;s father and the last king of Yan, ordered the execution of Dan to please Qin after the Yan capital Ji fell to Qin. Invasion of Qin did halt for few years, during which time the states of Wei and Chu were conquered. Meanwhile, the King Xi of Yan moved to the Liaodong Commandery.

The state of Yan was conquered in 222 BC and King Xi was captured.

All except King Xi were featured in the Chinese period epic &quot;The Emperor and the Assassin&quot;. Prince Dan is also featured in the 2004 TV series &quot;Assassinator Jing Ke&quot;.

<text>The 16&quot;/50 [[Caliber (artillery)|caliber]] Mark 7 – United States Naval Gun is the main armament of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships and was the planned main armament of the canceled .

==Description==
Due to a lack of communication during design in 1938, the Bureau of Ordnance assumed the &quot;Iowa&quot; class would use the /50 Mark 2 guns constructed for the 1920 &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class battleships and &quot;Lexington&quot;-class battlecruisers. However, the Bureau of Construction and Repair assumed that the ships would carry a compact 16-in/50 turret and designed the ships with barbettes too small to accommodate the 16-in/50 Mark 2 three-gun turret that the Bureau of Ordnance was actually working on. The lightweight 16-in/50 Mark 7 was designed to resolve this conflict.

These guns were 50 calibers long, 50 times their bore diameter with barrels long, from chamber to muzzle. Each gun weighed about without the breech, and with the breech. They fired projectiles weighing from at different muzzle velocities, depending on the projectile. When firing armor-piercing projectiles, their muzzle velocity was with a range of up to . At maximum range the projectile spent almost minutes in flight. Each turret required a crew of 79 men to operate. The turrets cost US$1.4 million each, excluding the cost of the guns.

The turrets were described as &quot;three-gun&quot; rather than &quot;triple&quot; because each barrel could be elevated independently. The ships could fire any combination of their guns, up to a broadside of all nine. The turret interiors were subdivided and designed to permit the independent loading, elevation and firing of each gun. Each turret was fitted with an optical range finder, ballistic analog computer, and a switchboard. The rangefinder and ballistic computer permitted the turret&#x27;s gun captain and crew to locally engage targets should battle damage disrupt communication with the ship&#x27;s primary or auxiliary fire control centers. The firing switchboard allowed any remaining fire control computer to send data to or control the firing computers of other turrets in the event of battle damage to the primary and secondary artillery plotting rooms.

Contrary to popular belief, the ships did not move sideways noticeably when a broadside was fired; this was an illusion. With the enormous mass of the vessel and the damping effect of the water around the hull, the pressure wave generated by the gunfire was felt as just a slight change in lateral velocity. The sea surface on the side of the ship to which the guns are trained is roiled by the guns&#x27; muzzle blast, which creates the illusion of motion in still photos.

The guns could be elevated from −5 degrees to +45 degrees, moving at up to 12 degrees per second. The turrets could rotate about 300 degrees at about 4 degrees per second and could be fired back beyond the beam, sometimes called firing &quot;over the shoulder&quot;. A red stripe on the wall of each turret, inches from the railing, marked the limit of the gun&#x27;s recoil as a safety warning to the turret&#x27;s crew.

Complementing the 16-in/50 caliber Mark 7 gun was a fire control computer, the Ford Instrument Company Mark 8 Range Keeper. This analog computer was used to direct the fire from the battleship&#x27;s big guns, taking into account factors including the speed of the targeted ship, the projectile&#x27;s travel time, and air resistance. At the time the was set to begin construction, the range keepers had gained the ability to use radar data to direct fire. The results of this advance were telling: the range keeper was able to track and fire at targets at greater range and with increased accuracy, day or night. This gave the US Navy a major advantage in the latter half of WWII, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy. With a few exceptions, such as the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, Japanese warships at best used basic radar sets that were not connected to fire control, still relying on optical rangefinders. Even the few Japanese warships that had radar-assisted guns did not directly link their fire control and radar, having to input the locations of targets spotted on radar into the fire control manually.

The 16&quot;/50 caliber&#x27;s advanced fire control was designed to allow it to fire accurately at its maximum range, which exceeded any opposing ship&#x27;s effective firing range. However, this proved not to be possible. The US soon learned that projectile dispersion was not something fire control, no matter how advanced, could solve (this remains true: modern guns with more advanced radar cannot fire accurately from maximum range, being limited to a shorter accurate effective range). Several live-firing tests were conducted by &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships in which the 16&quot;/50 displayed shockingly low hit rates from the extreme ranges, it was designed to fight from shorter range, even with its very advanced radar. Most notably USS &quot;Iowa&quot; bombarded the former battleship target &quot;Nevada&quot; over five days, with an extremely low hit rate, failing to sink the target ship, demonstrating that a ship armed with these guns could not fire accurately at an enemy ship while remaining out of range of the enemy&#x27;s guns.

During their reactivation in the 1980s, the up-to-date Mark 160 Fire Control System was used to guide the fire of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship Mark 7 guns.

==Construction==


The Mark 7 gun was a built-up gun and was constructed of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons built in the 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It had a Welin breech block that opened downwards and was hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug was segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.

==Mark 8 &quot;Super-heavy&quot; shell==

The Mark 7 gun was originally intended to fire the Mark 5 armor-piercing shell. However, the shell-handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the &quot;super-heavy&quot; APCBC (Armor Piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped) Mark 8 shell before any of the &#x27;s keels were laid down. The large-caliber guns were designed to fire either an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work, and a high-explosive round for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment.

The and classes could also fire the 2,700-pound Mark 8 shell with the 16&quot;/45 caliber Mark 6 gun, although with a shorter range. The Mark 6 gun was not as heavy as the Mark 7, which helped both battleship classes to conform to the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. However, the two treaty-era battleships fired their shells at a lower muzzle velocity, which made their plunging fire superior to that of the 16&quot;/50 caliber gun.

The Mark 8 shells gave the &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;South Dakota&quot;, and &quot;Iowa&quot; classes the second-heaviest broadside of all battleship classes, even though the first two ship classes were treaty battleships, exceeded only by the &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships.

Each D839 propellant (smokeless powder) grain used for full charges for this gun was long, in diameter and had seven perforations, each in diameter with a web thickness range of between the perforations and the grain diameter. A maximum charge consisted of six silk bags (hence the term &quot;bag gun&quot;), each filled with of propellant.

==Service history==
Off of Truk Atoll on 16 February 1944, &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; engaged the at a range of and straddled (one shot on Nowaki&#x27;s port side, and the second on her starboard), setting the record for the longest-ranged straddle in history (although not a single hit was claimed). Some reports indicated the near misses caused splinter damage and casualties to the crew. &quot;Nowaki&quot; was able to escape due to the range and her speed. The action against &quot;Nowaki&quot; was part of Operation Hailstone. This is the only surface engagement that &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships are known to have engaged in. In the action, &quot;Iowa&quot; sank the Japanese training cruiser &quot;Katori&quot;, while &quot;New Jersey&quot; helped to sink destroyer &quot;Maikaze&quot;, and the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Akagi Maru&quot;. This surface action was controversial since US Navy carrier aircraft were available and could have achieved similar results.

==1960s==
The gun was also used as the basis for Project HARP, an experimental gun-based space-launch research program.

<doc id="311910" wikidata="Q1132233" url="?curid=311910" title="Stargate Project (U.S. Army unit)">
<text>Stargate Project was a secret U.S. Army unit established in 1977 at Fort Meade, Maryland, by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and SRI International (a California contractor) to investigate the potential for psychic phenomena in military and domestic intelligence applications. The project, and its precursors and sister projects, originally went by various code names &quot;Gondola Wish&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot;, &quot;Grill Flame&quot;, &quot;Center Lane&quot;, &quot;Project CF&quot;, &quot;Sun Streak&quot;, and &quot;Scanate&quot; until 1991, when they were consolidated and rechristened as the &quot;Stargate Project&quot;.

The Stargate Project&#x27;s work primarily involved remote viewing, the purported ability to psychically &quot;see&quot; events, sites, or information from a great distance. The project was overseen until 1987 by Lt. Frederick Holmes &quot;Skip&quot; Atwater (born 1947), an aide and &quot;psychic headhunter&quot; to Maj. Gen. Albert Stubblebine, and later president of the Monroe Institute. The unit was small-scale, comprising about 15 to 20 individuals, and was run out of &quot;an old, leaky wooden barracks&quot;.

The Stargate Project was terminated and declassified in 1995 after a CIA report concluded that it was never useful in any intelligence operation. Information provided by the program was vague and included irrelevant and erroneous data, and there were suspicions of inter-judge reliability. The program was featured in the 2004 book and 2009 film &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot;, although neither mentions it by name. George Stephanopoulos, in his 2024 book &quot;The Situation Room&quot;, mentions the project by the name Grill Flame, in discussing a May 8, 1980, Situation Room briefing for President Carter, after Carter&#x27;s failed hostage rescue mission in Iran on April 24, 1980.

==Background==

Upon allegedly receiving reports the Soviets were researching occult phenomena and parapsychology, the CIA and DIA decided they should investigate and know as much about these subjects as possible. Various programs were approved yearly and re-funded accordingly. Reviews were made semi-annually at the Senate and House select committee level. Work results were reviewed, and remote viewing was attempted with the results being kept secret from the &quot;viewer&quot;. It was thought that if the viewer was shown they were incorrect, it would damage the viewer&#x27;s confidence and skill. This was standard operating procedure throughout the years of military and domestic remote-viewing programs. Feedback to the remote viewer of any kind was rare; it was kept classified and secret.

Remote viewing attempts to sense unknown information about places or events. Normally it is performed to detect current events, but during military and domestic intelligence applications viewers claimed to sense things in the future, experiencing precognition.

== History ==
===1970s===
In 1970 United States intelligence sources believed that the Soviet Union was spending 60 million roubles annually on &quot;psychotronic&quot; research. In response to claims that the Soviet program had produced results, the CIA initiated funding for a new program known as SCANATE (&quot;scan by coordinate&quot;) in the same year. Remote viewing research began in 1972 at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in Menlo Park, California. Proponents (Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff) of the research said that a minimum accuracy rate of 65% required by the clients was often exceeded in the later experiments.

Physicists Targ and Puthoff began testing psychics for SRI in 1972, including Israeli Uri Geller, who would later become an international celebrity. Their apparently successful results garnered interest within the U.S. Department of Defense. Ray Hyman, professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, was asked by Air Force psychologist Lt. Col. Austin W. Kibler (1930–2008) then director of Behavioral Research for ARPA to go to SRI and investigate. He was to specifically evaluate Geller. Hyman&#x27;s report to the government was that Geller was a &quot;complete fraud&quot;, and as a consequence Targ and Puthoff lost their government contract to work further with him. The result was a publicity tour for Geller, Targ, and Puthoff to seek private funding for further research work on Geller.

One of the project&#x27;s successes was the location of a lost Soviet spy plane in 1976 by Rosemary Smith, a young administrative assistant recruited by project director Dale Graff.

In 1977 the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) Systems Exploitation Detachment (SED) started the Gondola Wish program to &quot;evaluate potential adversary applications of remote viewing&quot;. Army Intelligence then formalized this in mid-1978 as an operational program Grill Flame, based in buildings 2560 and 2561 at Fort Meade in Maryland (INSCOM &quot;Detachment G&quot;).

===1980s===
In early 1979 the research at SRI was integrated into &quot;Grill Flame&quot;, which was redesignated INSCOM &quot;Center Lane&quot; Project (ICLP) in 1983. In 1984 the existence of the program was reported by Jack Anderson, and in that year it was unfavorably received by the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council. In late 1985 the Army funding was terminated, but the program was redesignated &quot;Sun Streak&quot; and funded by the DIA&#x27;s Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate (office code DT-S).

===1990s===
In 1991 most of the contracting for the program was transferred from SRI to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), with Edwin May controlling 70% of the contractor funds and 85% of the data. Its security was altered from Special Access Program (SAP) to Limited Dissemination (LIMDIS), and it was given its final name, STARGATE.

===Closure (1995)===
In 1995 the defense appropriations bill directed that the program be transferred from DIA to CIA oversight. The CIA commissioned a report by the American Institutes for Research (AIR) that found that remote viewing had not been proved to work by a psychic mechanism, and said it had not been used operationally. The CIA subsequently cancelled and declassified the program.

In 1995 the project was transferred to the CIA and a retrospective evaluation of the results was done. The appointed panel consisted primarily of Jessica Utts, Meena Shah and Ray Hyman. Hyman had produced an unflattering report on Uri Geller and SRI for the government two decades earlier, but the psychologist David Marks found Utts&#x27; appointment to the review panel &quot;puzzling&quot; given that she had published papers with Edwin May, considering this joint research likely to make her &quot;less than [im]partial&quot;. A report by Utts claimed the results were evidence of psychic functioning; however, Hyman in his report argued Utts&#x27;s conclusion that ESP had been proven to exist, especially precognition, was premature and the findings had not been independently replicated. Hyman came to the conclusion:

Psychologists, such as myself, who study subjective validation find nothing striking or surprising in the reported matching of reports against targets in the Stargate data. The overwhelming amount of data generated by the viewers is vague, general, and way off target. The few apparent hits are just what we would expect if nothing other than reasonable guessing and subjective validation are operating.

A later report by AIR came to a negative conclusion. Joe Nickell has written:

Other evaluators – two psychologists from AIR – assessed the potential intelligence-gathering usefulness of remote viewing. They concluded that the alleged psychic technique was of dubious value and lacked the concreteness and reliability necessary for it to be used as a basis for making decisions or taking action. The final report found &quot;reason to suspect&quot; that in &quot;some well publicised cases of dramatic hits&quot; the remote viewers might have had &quot;substantially more background information&quot; than might otherwise be apparent.

According to AIR, which performed a review of the project, no remote viewing report ever provided actionable information for any intelligence operation.

Based upon the collected findings, which recommended a higher level of critical research and tighter controls, the CIA terminated the 20 million dollar project, citing a lack of documented evidence that the program had any value to the intelligence community. &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated in 1995 three full-time psychics were still working on a $500,000-a-year budget out of Fort Meade, Maryland, which would soon close.

David Marks in his book &quot;The Psychology of the Psychic&quot; (2000) discussed the flaws in the Stargate Project in detail. Marks wrote that there were six negative design features of the experiments. The possibility of cues or sensory leakage was not ruled out, no independent replication, some experiments were conducted in secret, making peer-review impossible. Marks noted that the judge Edwin May was also the principal investigator for the project and this was problematic, making a huge conflict of interest with collusion, cuing and fraud being possible. Marks concluded the project was nothing more than a &quot;subjective delusion&quot; and after two decades of research it had failed to provide any scientific evidence for the legitimacy of remote viewing.

The Stargate Project was terminated in 1995 following an independent review which concluded:

In January 2017, the CIA published records online of the Stargate Project as part of the CREST archive.

==Methodology==
The Stargate Project created a set of protocols designed to make the research of clairvoyance and out-of-body experiences more scientific, and to minimize as much as possible session noise and inaccuracy. The term &quot;remote viewing&quot; emerged as shorthand to describe this more structured approach to clairvoyance. Project Stargate would only receive a mission after all other intelligence attempts, methods, or approaches had already been exhausted.

It was reported that at peak manpower there were over 22 active military and civilian remote viewers providing data. People leaving the project were not replaced. When the project closed in 1995 this number had dwindled down to three. One was using tarot cards. According to Joseph McMoneagle, &quot;The Army never had a truly open attitude toward psychic functioning&quot;. Hence, the use of the term &quot;giggle factor&quot; and the saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to be found dead next to a psychic&quot;.

==Civilian personnel==

===Hal Puthoff===
In the 1970s, CIA and DIA granted funds to Harold E. Puthoff to investigate paranormal abilities, collaborating with Russell Targ in a study of the purported psychic abilities of Uri Geller, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of the Stargate Project, of which Puthoff became a director.

As with Ingo Swann and Pat Price, Puthoff attributed much of his personal remote viewing skills to his involvement with Scientology whereby he had attained, at that time, the highest level. All three eventually left Scientology in the late 1970s.

Puthoff worked as the principal investigator of the project. His team of psychics is said to have identified spies, located Soviet weapons and technologies, such as a nuclear submarine in 1979 and helped find lost SCUD missiles in the first Gulf War and plutonium in North Korea in 1994.

===Russell Targ===

In the 1970s, Russell Targ began working with Harold Puthoff on the Stargate Project, while working with him as a researcher at Stanford Research Institute.

===Edwin May===
Edwin C. May joined the Stargate Project in 1975 as a consultant and was working full-time in 1976. The original project was part of the Cognitive Sciences Laboratory managed by May. With more funding in 1991 May took the project to the Palo Alto offices at SAIC. This would last until 1995 when the CIA closed the project.

May worked as the principal investigator, judge and the star gatekeeper for the project. Marks says this was a serious weakness for the experiments as May had conflict of interest and could have done whatever he wanted with the data. Marks has written that May refused to release the names of the &quot;oversight committee&quot; and refused permission for him to give an independent judging of the Stargate transcripts. Marks found this suspicious, commenting &quot;this refusal suggests that something must be wrong with the data or with the methods of data selection.&quot;

===Ingo Swann===

Originally tested in the &quot;Phase One&quot; were OOBE-Beacon &quot;RV&quot; experiments at the American Society for Psychical Research, under research director Karlis Osis. A former OT VII Scientologist,
who alleged to have coined the term &#x27;remote viewing&#x27; as a derivation of protocols originally developed by René Warcollier, a French chemical engineer in the early 20th century, documented in his book. Swann&#x27;s achievement was to break free from the conventional mold of casual experimentation and candidate burn out, and develop a viable set of protocols that put clairvoyance within a framework named &quot;Coordinate Remote Viewing&quot; (CRV).
In a 1995 letter Edwin C. May wrote he had not used Swann for two years because there were rumors of him briefing a high level person at SAIC and the CIA on remote viewing and aliens, ETs.

===Pat Price===
A former Burbank, California, police officer and former Scientologist who participated in a number of Cold War era remote viewing experiments, including the US government-sponsored projects SCANATE and the Stargate Project. Price joined the program after a chance encounter with fellow Scientologists (at the time) Harold Puthoff and Ingo Swann near SRI. Working with maps and photographs provided to him by the CIA, Price claimed to have been able to retrieve information from facilities behind Soviet lines. He is probably best known for his sketches of cranes and gantries which appeared to conform to CIA intelligence photographs. At the time, the CIA took his claims seriously.

==Military personnel==

===Lieutenant General James Clapper===
The project leader in the 1990s was Lt. Gen. Clapper who later would serve as the Director of National Intelligence.

===Major General Albert Stubblebine===

A key sponsor of the research internally at Fort Meade, Maryland, Maj. Gen. Stubblebine was convinced of the reality of a wide variety of psychic phenomena. He required that all of his battalion commanders learn how to bend spoons Uri Geller, and he himself attempted several psychic feats, even attempting to walk through walls. In the early 1980s he was responsible for the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), during which time the remote viewing project in the US Army began. Some commentators have confused a &quot;Project Jedi&quot;, allegedly run by Special Forces primarily out of Fort Bragg, with Stargate. After some controversy involving these experiments, including alleged security violations from uncleared civilian psychics working in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs), Stubblebine was placed on retirement. His successor as the INSCOM commander was Maj. Gen. Harry Soyster, who had a reputation as a much more conservative and conventional intelligence officer. Soyster was not amenable to continuing paranormal experiments and the Army&#x27;s participation in Project Stargate ended during his tenure.

===David Morehouse===
In his book, &quot;Psychic Warrior: Inside the CIA&#x27;s Stargate Program: The True Story of a Soldier&#x27;s Espionage and Awakening&quot; (2000, St. Martin&#x27;s Press, ), Morehouse claims to have worked on hundreds of remote viewing assignments, from searching for a Soviet jet that crashed in the jungle carrying an atomic bomb, to tracking suspected double agents.

===Joseph McMoneagle===

McMoneagle claims he had a remarkable memory of very early childhood events. He grew up surrounded by alcoholism, abuse and poverty. As a child, he had visions at night when scared, and began to hone his psychic abilities in his teens for his own protection when he hitchhiked. He enlisted to get away. McMoneagle became an experimental remote viewer while serving in U.S. Army Intelligence.

===Ed Dames===
Dames&#x27; role was intended to be as session monitor and analyst as an aid to Fred Atwater rather than a remote viewer, Dames received no formal remote viewing training. After his assignment to the remote viewing unit at the end of January 1986, he was used to &quot;run&quot; remote viewers (as monitor) and provide training and practice sessions to viewer personnel. He soon established a reputation for pushing CRV to extremes, with target sessions on Atlantis, Mars, UFOs, and aliens. He has been a frequent guest on the &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; radio shows.

<text>Cucurbita pepo is a cultivated plant of the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot;. It yields varieties of winter squash and pumpkin, but the most widespread varieties belong to the subspecies &quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;pepo&quot;, called summer squash.

It has been domesticated in the Americas for thousands of years. Some authors maintain that &quot;C. pepo&quot; is derived from &quot;C. texana&quot;, while others suggest that &quot;C. texana&quot; is merely feral &quot;C. pepo&quot;. They have a wide variety of uses, especially as a food source and for medical conditions. &quot;C. pepo&quot; seems more closely related to &quot;C. fraterna&quot;, though disagreements exist about the exact nature of that connection, too.

It is a host species for the melonworm moth, the squash vine borer, and the pickleworm. They are also the preferred pollen for squash bees.

== Description ==

Due to their varied genetic background, members of &quot;C. pepo&quot; vary widely in appearance, primarily in regards to their fruits. The plants are typically high and wide, with yellow flowers. Within &quot;C. pepo&quot;, the pumpkins, scallops, and possibly crooknecks are ancient and were domesticated separately. The domesticated species have larger fruits and larger yet fewer seeds. Parthenocarpy is known to occur in certain cultivars of &quot;C. pepo&quot;.

The leaves have three to five lobes and are wide. All the subspecies, varieties, and cultivars are conspecific and interfertile.

== Taxonomy ==

=== Origin and history ===
&quot;C. pepo&quot; is one of the oldest, if not the oldest domesticated species. The oldest known locations are in southern Mexico in Oaxaca 8,000–10,000 years ago and Ocampo, Tamaulipas, Mexico about 7,000 years ago. 

Before the arrival of Europeans, &quot;C. pepo&quot;, along with &quot;C. moschata&quot;, had been carried over all parts of North America where they could be grown. The ancient territory of &quot;C. pepo&quot; extended north into Texas and up the Greater Mississippi River Valley into Illinois and east to Florida, and possibly even to Maine. It is one of several plants cultivated in prehistoric North America as part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. It is known to have appeared in Missouri at least 4,000 years ago. Some varieties grow in arid regions and some in moist regions. Many of these peoples, particularly in the west, still grow a diversity of hardy squashes and pumpkins not to be found in commercial markets. Still, neither &quot;C. pepo&quot; nor &quot;C. moschata&quot; had been carried into South America as had beans, which originated in the same general region.

Debates about the origin of &quot;C. pepo&quot; have been going on since at least 1857. Recent biosystematic investigations indicate two distinct domestication events in two different areas: one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States, with &quot;C. pepo subsp. fraterna&quot; and &quot;C. pepo subsp. texana&quot;, respectively, as the predominant ancestral species from a phylogenetic perspective.

=== Subdivision ===
The morphological differences within the species &quot;C. pepo&quot; are so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species. These vast differences are rooted in its widespread geographic distribution. 

Several taxa have been proposed, but as of 2012 none has been universally accepted. In 2002, the taxa conventions proposed by Decker-Walters were:
*&quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;pepo&quot; - cultivated pumpkins, marrows, the orange gourds (&quot;Orange Ball&quot; and &quot;Orange Warted&quot;)
*&quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;ovifera&quot; var. &quot;ovifera&quot; – cultivated crooknecks, scallops, acorns, most ornamental gourds
*&quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;ovifera&quot; var. &quot;ozarkana&quot; – wild populations in the Greater Mississippi Valley and Ozark Plateau
*&quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;ovifera&quot; var. &quot;texana&quot; – wild populations in Texas
*&quot;C. pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;fraterna&quot; – wild populations in northeastern Mexico

A 2003 study recognized three subspecies:
*&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;fraterna&quot;
*&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;pepo&quot;
*&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot; subsp. &quot;texana&quot;

In 1986, botanist Paris proposed a taxonomy of &quot;C. pepo&quot; consisting of eight edible groups based on their basic shape. All but a few &quot;C. pepo&quot; cultivars can be included in these groups. These eight edible cultivated varieties of &quot;C. pepo&quot; vary widely in shape and color, and one inedible cultivated variety:

Random amplified polymorphic DNA has proven useful in sorting out the relationships of the &quot;C. pepo&quot; species, varieties, and cultivars, showing that few, if any, modern cultivars have their origins with &quot;C. texana&quot;. They are associated with &quot;C. fraterna&quot; or a still-unknown ancestral specimen in southern Mexico.

It has been proposed that the domesticated forms of &quot;C. pepo&quot; are a compilospecies of &quot;C. pepo subsp. fraterna&quot; and &quot;C. pepo subsp. texana&quot;. A 1989 study on the origins and development of &quot;C. pepo&quot; suggested that the original wild specimen was a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant. This investigation proposed that the crookneck, ornamental gourd, and scallop are early variants, and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and pumpkin.

Based on genetic allele analysis, two distinct groups occur within domesticated &quot;C. pepo&quot;: pumpkin, calabaza, criolla, and marrow squash are in one; and ornamental gourds, crookneck, acorn, scallop, and a few others in the second one. &quot;C. pepo subsp. fraterna&quot; is genetically closer to the first group and &quot;C. pepo subsp. texana&quot; is genetically closer to the second group.

==== Subspecies &quot;fraterna&quot; ====
This subspecies was formerly considered a separate species called &quot;C. fraterna&quot; by some authorities, but modern biosystematics has placed it as a subspecies of &quot;C. pepo&quot;. The isozymes are similar between &quot;Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo&quot;, and all studied &quot;C. fraterna&quot; alleles are also found in &quot;C. pepo subsp. pepo&quot;. It is native to Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, Mexico. This subspecies has not been domesticated. It is considered to be the progenitor and nearest relative of the domesticated subspecies &quot;C. pepo subsp. pepo&quot; which is found in the same areas as &quot;C. pepo subsp. fraterna&quot;. It was first formally described by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1943, in &quot;Gentes Herbarum&quot;.

Unlike most wild &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, some specimens of &quot;C. fraterna&quot; have been found without bitter fruit. Its usual habitat is dry upland scrub areas. It blooms in September and fruits ripen in December.


==== Subspecies &quot;texana&quot; ====
This subspecies was formerly considered a separate species &quot;C. texana&quot; by some authorities before being reclassified as a subspecies of &quot;C. pepo&quot;. A common name is Texas gourd. This subspecies is mesophytic and native to Texas, primarily the southeastern region where it can be found in or near sandy riverbeds. It is found only in the wild. It is possibly a progenitor and close relative of the domesticated subspecies &quot;Cucurbita pepo subsp. ovifera&quot;, though they are native to different areas. The &quot;fraterna&quot; subspecies is also closely related. It was first collected 1835 by J. L. Berlandier in southern Texas. It was formally described as &quot;Tristemon texanus&quot; by George Heinrich Adolf Scheele in 1848 and transferred to the genus &quot;Cucurbita&quot; by Asa Gray in 1850.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is found from sea level to slightly above .

== Uses ==
It is an ingredient in &quot;&quot;schumaakwe&quot; cakes&quot; and is used externally for rheumatism and swelling. A poultice of seeds and blossoms is applied to cactus scratches. Fresh squash is cut into spiral strips, folded into hanks and hung up to dry for winter use. The blossoms are cooked in grease and used as a delicacy in combination with other foods. Fresh squash, either whole or in pieces, is roasted in ashes and used for food. In the Zuni culture, the gourds are made into cups, ladles, and dippers and put to various uses. The gourds are also worn in phallic dances symbolizing fructification or made into ceremonial rattles. Gourds are also made into receptacles for storing precious articles.

<doc id="311916" wikidata="Q2303219" url="?curid=311916" title="Binge eating">
<text>Binge eating is a pattern of disordered eating which consists of episodes of uncontrollable eating. It is a common symptom of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. During such binges, a person rapidly consumes an excessive quantity of food. A diagnosis of binge eating is associated with feelings of loss of control. Binge eating disorder is also linked with being overweight and obesity.

== Diagnosis ==
The DSM-5 includes a disorder diagnosis criterion for Binge Eating Disorder (BED). It is as follows:

* Recurrent and persistent episodes of binge eating
* Binge eating episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following: 
** Eating much more rapidly than normal
** Eating until feeling uncomfortably full
** Eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry 
** Eating alone because of being embarrassed by how much one is eating
** Feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty after overeating
* Marked distress regarding binge eating 
* Absence of regular compensatory behaviors (such as purging)

== Warning signs ==
Typical warning signs of binge eating disorder include the disappearance of a large quantity of food in a relatively short period of time. A person who may be experiencing binge eating disorder may appear to be uncomfortable when eating around others or in public. A person may develop new and extreme eating patterns that they have never done before. These might include diets that cut out certain food groups completely such as a no dairy or no carb diet. Binge eating can begin after a first attempt at dieting. They might also steal or hoard food in unusual places. A person may be experiencing fluctuations in their weight. In addition, they may have feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt about overeating. Another possible warning sign of binge eating is that a person may be obsessed with their body image or weight.

Furthermore, patients who binge eat may also engage in other self-destructing behaviours like suicide attempts, drug use, shop-lifting, and drinking too much alcohol. The onset of binge eating without dieting is linked to a higher risk of mental health issues and a younger age of onset. BED patients can experience comorbid psychiatric instability.

== Causes ==
There are no direct causes of binge eating; however, long-term dieting, psychological issues and an obsession with body image have been linked to binge eating. There are multiple factors that increase a person&#x27;s risk of developing binge eating disorder. Family history could play a role if that person had a family member who was affected by binge eating. Said person may not have a supportive or friendly home environment, and they have a hard time expressing their problems with BED. Having a history of going on extreme diets may cause an urge to binge eat. Psychological issues such as feeling negatively about oneself or the way they look may trigger a binge.

Weight stigma has also been found to predict binge eating, highlighting the importance of weight inclusive approaches to binge eating disorder that do not exercerbate this potential cause.

== Health risks ==
There are several physical, emotional, and social health risks when associated with binge eating disorder. These risks include depression, anxiety, and heart disease.

One study found that people with obesity who experience binge eating have a higher body mass index, and higher levels of depression and stress than those who did not have with binge eating disorder Exposure to two major categories of risk factors—those that raise the risk for obesity and those that raise the risk for psychiatric disorders in general—can be associated with binge eating disorder.

==Effects==
Typically, the eating is done rapidly, and a person will feel emotionally numb and unable to stop eating. Most people who have eating binges try to hide this behavior from others, and often feel ashamed about being overweight or depressed about their overeating. Although people who do not have any eating disorder may occasionally experience episodes of overeating, frequent binge eating is often a symptom of an eating disorder.

BED is characterized by uncontrollable, excessive eating, followed by feelings of shame and guilt. Unlike those with bulimia, those with BED symptoms typically do not purge their food, fast, or excessively exercise to compensate for binges. Additionally, these individuals tend to diet more often, enroll in weight-control programs and have a history of family obesity. However, many who have bulimia also have binge-eating disorder.

Along with the social and physical health that is affected when suffering from BED, there are psychiatric disorders that are often linked to BED. Some of them being but are not limited to: 
depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, substance abuse/use disorder.

== Treatments ==
Current treatments for binge eating disorder mainly consist of psychological therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT). A study conducted on the long term efficacy of psychological treatments for binge eating showed that both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and group interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) effectively treat binge eating disorder, with 64.4% of patients completely recovering from binge eating.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, also known as Vyvanse, is the only medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder in adults as of 2024. However, some studies have called into question its effectiveness for this indication.

== History ==
===APA DSM===
The American Psychiatric Association mentioned and listed binge eating under the listed criteria and features of bulimia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) - 3 in 1987. By including binge eating in the DSM-3, even if not on its own as a separate eating disorder, they brought awareness to the disorder and gave it mental disorder legitimacy. This allowed for people to receive the appropriate treatment for binge eating and for their disorder to be legitimized.

===Drug therapy===
In January 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse), the first medication indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder.

== Men with binge eating ==
Men with binge eating often face unique barriers to seeking treatment due to socio-cultural expectations surrounding masculinity. After men compare their bodies to the culturally constructed masculine ideals, they often develop heightened concerns about their own body image and internalize the belief that their bodies should be muscular, lean, and strong, developing unhealthy behaviors like binge eating or using fad diets. Many men hesitate to reach out for help out of fear of appearing weak, &#x27;less like a man&#x27; or even homosexual. The pervasive stereotype that eating disorders primarily affect women has contributed to feelings of shame and isolation among men who are affected by these disorders. This gender-based stigma surrounding eating disorders and strongly feminine branding of eating disorder treatment centers create a significant barrier to men&#x27;s willingness to reach out for support. Men are more likely to partake in compulsive or excessive exercising as a compensation to highly calorific diets, leading to body dysmorphia.

<text>Hasim Sharif Rahman (born November 7, 1972) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1994 to 2014. He is a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the unified WBC, IBF, IBO and lineal titles in 2001; and the WBC title again from 2005 to 2006. He was ranked as a top 10 heavyweight by BoxRec from 2000 to 2007, and reached his highest ranking of world No.6 in 2000.

Rahman first became known on the world stage in 2001 when he scored an upset knockout victory against Lennox Lewis to win the unified heavyweight championship. Lewis avenged the loss and regained his championship by knocking out Rahman in a rematch later that year. Rahman won the WBC title (initially the interim version) for a second time in 2005 by defeating Monte Barrett, after which the WBC elevated him to full champion status by the year&#x27;s end. His reign as champion ended in 2006 via another knockout loss, this time to Oleg Maskaev in a rematch of their first fight in 1999.

==Professional career==

===1994–1997: prospect===
Rahman started boxing at a relatively late age, taking up the sport at the age of 20. He had just 10 amateur bouts before making his pro debut on December 3, 1994, at age 22. Rahman tried to compensate on his lack of amateur background by being busy in the pros, sometimes fighting within five days from the previous bout. Rahman had nine professional fights in 1995, and eleven in 1996.

Rahman had obvious natural boxing skills that propelled him to 11 knockout wins in his first 12 fights. He took a step up in class in March 1996 with a 10-round decision win over veteran Ross Puritty and seven months later, he repeated the feat against former world champion Trevor Berbick. In July 1997, he won the regional USBA heavyweight title, and four months later, he added another regional belt, the IBF Intercontinental heavyweight title, defending the USBA title three times and the Intercontinental belt twice.

===1998–2000: heavyweight title contention===

On December 19, 1998, Rahman faced fellow contender David Tua in a fight to determine the IBF&#x27;s mandatory contender. Rahman was using his power jab well, out boxing Tua virtually every round. At the end of the 9th round Tua staggered Rahman with a devastating punch after the bell that dazed him. At the beginning of the next round Tua hit him with several heavy shots and the referee jumped in when Rahman was bobbing and weaving. Tua won by TKO. It was argued that it should have been a DQ.

Because of the controversial nature of the loss, Rahman&#x27;s ranking did not suffer, but in November 1999, he was knocked out by Oleg Maskaev in the eighth round of a fight he looked to be winning. At one point during the match, Rahman was knocked through the ropes onto the floor, hitting his head on the floor. Rahman dropped out of &quot;The Ring&quot; top 10 as a result of the surprise loss. Rahman later said that he had seen Maskaev earlier in his career get knocked out in the first round by former champion Oliver McCall and he assumed he was brought in as an easy win. Rahman claimed that because of this, he did not train as hard as he should have and was beaten.

===2001: first world title and Lewis rivalry===
Rahman came back with three wins, including one in May 2000 over Corrie Sanders in a war in which he was dropped twice and came back to win in 7, and after that he was moved back up in the rankings. After this fight, Sanders briefly retired. Finally, on April 22, 2001, Rahman earned a shot at Lennox Lewis the WBC, IBO and IBF heavyweight champion with a win over Frankie Swindell. Rahman beat Swindell via 7th-round RTD. Swindell quit on his stool after the 7th round, informing the ringside doctor that he had suffered an eye injury.

In the fight, held at Brakpan, South Africa, Lewis and Rahman traded hard blows for five rounds before Rahman, a 20-to-1 underdog, stunned the crowd by defeating Lewis via 5th-round KO. It was only the second loss of Lewis&#x27; career. His first was on September 24, 1994, when Oliver McCall defeated him via 2nd-round TKO.

Lewis had an immediate-rematch clause in the contract for his defense against Hasim, and chose to invoke it. Rahman and his new promoter, Don King, made plans to defend the titles against David Izon, rather than giving Lewis his rematch. Lewis sued Rahman in U.S. federal court to enforce their contract. The judge, Neil McCluskey sided with Lewis and on November 17, 2001, in Las Vegas, the two men met again. This time, Lewis brutally knocked Rahman out in the fourth round. For the rematch, Lewis made $11 million and Rahman got $10 million. The fight generated 460,000 pay-per-view buys and $23 million in revenue.

===2002–2004: comeback===

Rahman&#x27;s comeback fight ended in disappointment, he was beaten by a technical decision by aging former champion Evander Holyfield after headbutts from Holyfield caused a massive swelling (severe hematoma) on Rahman&#x27;s forehead.

On March 29, 2003, Rahman faced David Tua for a second time. The fight was ruled a draw after one judge scored it for Rahman, a second for Tua and a third had the score even. Tua was knocked down a split second after the bell rang and it was not ruled an official knockdown. Rahman came in at the heaviest weight of his career. In June, Rahman was elevated to the No. 1 contender&#x27;s position by the WBC.

On December 13, Rahman was matched with former WBA world champion John Ruiz, in a match for an Interim WBA heavyweight title (caused by Roy Jones Jr. deciding whether he wanted to stay a heavyweight or return to Light Heavyweight). Rahman was favored, but he lost by (twelve round) unanimous decision and again was out of condition. Ruiz, who became interim titleholder with this victory, was upgraded to WBA heavyweight champion after Roy Jones Jr. vacated the title on February 20, 2004, choosing to fight Antonio Tarver for the WBC and IBO light heavyweight titles (already in 2003), rather than Ruiz.

After this defeat, Rahman stepped back to a lower level of competition and defeated four journeyman fighters while working to get back into shape. His efforts paid off when he was rewarded with a fight against Kali Meehan on November 13, 2004. The fight was an elimination bout for the IBF, WBA, and WBC, with the winner being the number-one contender in more than one world-title organization. Rahman scored the victory by a fourth-round knockout at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden.

===2005: second world title and Vitali Klitschko fight cancellation===
The WBC designated Rahman as Vitali Klitschko&#x27;s next mandatory challenger; the fight was set for April 30, 2005. Klitschko injured his thigh while training for the fight, so it was rescheduled for June 18. As this date approached, Klitschko&#x27;s camp said that the thigh had not fully healed; the WBC made July 23 the new fight date. Soon after this second postponement, Vitali&#x27;s doctors reportedly discovered back injuries that they said demanded minor-yet-immediate corrective surgery. The WBC pushed Rahman&#x27;s title shot back again, this time to November 12; Rahman&#x27;s share of the purse following this match would reportedly be around US$4.2 million.

After this third rescheduling, Rahman, fought for a WBC &quot;Interim&quot; heavyweight championship and defeated Monte Barrett on August 13, 2005, via unanimous decision.

At this point, Klitschko would be stripped of his WBC title if his first fight back was not against Rahman. On November 7, it was announced that Klitschko had suffered severe right knee injuries during training; the WBC said it would strip him of the championship if he was unable to box within 60–90 days of a soon-to-be-announced base date. However, on November 9, Vitali Klitschko retired instead. On November 10, 2005, the WBC voted to award its heavyweight championship to Rahman, making Rahman a two-time heavyweight champion.

On December 9, 2005, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge ended Rahman&#x27;s contract with Don King and he signed instead with Top Rank Boxing.

===2006: title fights vs. Toney, Maskaev ===
On March 18, 2006, Rahman fought James Toney to a draw, in a 12-round fight in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and he retained the WBC heavyweight title. The judges scorecards read 114-114, 117-111 and 114-114. Judges Tom Kaczmarek and Nobuaki Uratani had Toney leading by one point heading into the 12th. Rahman only retained the title by winning the final round.

Rahman reached his peak rankings in 2006. The April 2006 issue of &quot;the Ring&quot; ranked him the #2 heavyweight in the world after IBF champion Chris Byrd. BoxRec retroactively ranked him #4 that year, below Nikolai Valuev, Lamon Brewster, and Chris Byrd.

On August 12, 2006, Rahman lost the WBC heavyweight championship to rival Oleg Maskaev by 12th Round TKO in a mandatory defense of his title. Rahman led on the judges&#x27; scorecards for most of the close fight, with the three judges respectively scoring it 106-103 for Rahman, 103-106 for Maskaev, and 105-104 for Rahman going into 12th round; Rahman landed 250 punches throughout the bout (47% accuracy) to Maskaev&#x27;s 184 (28% accuracy). However, Rahman was knocked down early in the 12th and eventually stumbled to the mat. Rahman was then holding on to the ropes to stay on his feet. Maskaev landed a flurry of punches with Rahman unable to defend himself. The referee stopped the bout to save Rahman from further punishment. Afterwards he said he should have followed his trainer&#x27;s game plan by staying cautious in the last round to win on points, instead of rushing Maskaev, mistakenly thinking him too tired to fight back.

===2007: second comeback===

After a 10-month layoff, Rahman resumed his career with a ten-round unanimous decision over Taurus Sykes June 14, 2007, at The Main Street Armory in Rochester, New York. Rahman then fought three times in three months defeating Dicky Ryan by second-round TKO on September 7, 2007. Hasim followed up by stopping Cerrone Fox on October 18, 2007. On November 15, 2007, Rahman then scored a 10th-round TKO for the NABF title against Zuri Lawrence. In this fight, Lawrence fell through the ropes on two occasions whilst ducking punches, once in round six and again in round nine. In round six, he landed on the floor below the ring, but beat the referee&#x27;s 20-count. He received a standing ovation from the crowd when he re-entered the ring.

===2008: Rahman vs. Toney II, Wladimir Klitschko===

Going into 2008, the 35 year old Rahman was still considered a potent fighter. He held the NABF continental title and was ranked #4 by the IBF and #8 by the WBO. BoxRec retroactively ranked him the world&#x27;s 8th best heavyweight in 2007. However, his two fights in that year would both end in defeat.

On July 16, 2008, Rahman was stopped by an accidental headbutt against James Toney. Toney was originally awarded a TKO victory as the referee declared Rahman had quit between rounds. A week later, the TKO victory was overturned and changed to a No Contest due to the headbutt. After three rounds, Toney was ahead on 29–28 on two of the judges cards while Rahman was ahead, 29–28 on the third card.

Rahman lost to Wladimir Klitschko by TKO in the 7th round on December 13, 2008, for his WBO, IBO &amp; IBF titles. Klitschko dominated the fight, winning every round while making good use of his left jab. Rahman seemed unable to withstand the Ukrainian&#x27;s punch power. The referee called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman failed to respond to a series of shots, having been knocked down in the sixth round and left visibly disoriented. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko was leading on all three judges scorecards, respectively 60–53, 60–53, and 60–47; Klitschko landed 178 punches (48% accuracy) to Rahman&#x27;s 30 (14% accuracy), a nearly six-fold disparity.

===2009–2011: layoff and third comeback===
In an interview dated February 26, 2009, with DreamFighters.com, Rahman expressed his interest in crossing over into mixed martial arts.

Fifteen months after the seventh round loss to Wladimir Klitschko in December 2008, Rahman made a comeback against 43-year-old journeyman Clinton Boldridge winning the fight via TKO 1. Rahman next fought on June 19, 2010, against journeyman Shannon Miller (16–4, 9 KO) in a match that took in the Niagara Falls Conference Centre, Niagara Falls, New York, United States. Rahman came into the ring at 260 pounds and won the bout by TKO in the 4th round, after sending Miller down in each of the four rounds. He then won his next three fights (all by knockout), against Damon Reed, Marcus McGee and Galen Brown. His win over Galen Brown marked Rahmans 50th professional win in his career. With this win, he ran his record to 5-0 (all wins via knock out) since his loss to Wladimir Klitschko.

===2012: title shot vs. Povetkin===
He was elevated to the WBA number one contender to face Alexander Povetkin on September 29, 2012, for the WBA regular heavyweight championship. Povetkin beat Rahman via 2nd-round TKO.

===2014: Super 8 Tournament===
In yet another attempt to re-enter the heavyweight scene Rahman signed up for the super 8 tournament, an elimination-style event staged in Auckland, New Zealand. But despite holding the tag as tournament favorite the ageing Rahman was outpointed by little-known club fighter Anthony Nansen in the quarter-final on June 4, 2014.

==Personal life==
Born on November 7, 1972, Rahman was raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He is a practising Muslim and was fasting in the month of Ramadan when he faced Lennox Lewis.

As a teenager, Rahman was an enforcer for drug dealers, and was known for surviving several shootings. He nearly died in a car accident (which left him with permanent scarring on his cheek and ear) and once survived a shooting where five bullets entered his body. In 2001, Rahman and his family were involved in a car accident shortly after a celebration at City Hall. Rahman sustained no serious injuries and received no medical assistance, while his wife, Crystal, was hospitalized.

Rahman has a son, Hasim Rahman Jr., who is a professional boxer as well.

<doc id="311923" wikidata="Q927771" url="?curid=311923" title="Ross Kemp">
<text>Ross James Kemp (born 21 July 1964) is an English actor, author, and television presenter. He rose to prominence in the role of Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Other roles include Graham Lodsworth in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and Detective Inspector Monk in &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;. Kemp presented the BAFTA Award-winning documentary television series &quot;Ross Kemp on Gangs&quot; (2004–2009).

==Early life==
Kemp was born on 21 July 1964 in Barking, Essex. His mother Jean was a hairdresser and his father John was a detective superintendent in the Metropolitan Police. His maternal great-grandfather was a sub-organist at Chichester Cathedral for many years. He has one brother, Darren, who is a filmmaker for the BBC. Kemp attended Shenfield High School and the Webber Douglas Academy.

==Acting career==

===Early career===
After training at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, Kemp received his Equity card when appearing alongside John Thaw and Richard Wilson at the Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea.

Kemp went on to feature in training films for the Ministry of Defence and the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (now &quot;Emmerdale&quot;) as Graham Lodsworth. Guest appearances in &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot; and &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; followed, before he had a minor role in the 1987 film &quot;Playing Away&quot; alongside Neil Morrissey.

In 1990, Kemp appeared in an edition of the Anglia Television police drama &quot;The Chief.&quot; The episode, entitled &quot;Call Sign Bravo&quot;, saw Kemp play the role of Police Constable Dennis Scovell. Around the same time he also starred in a golf themed advert for Kellogg&#x27;s Fruit &amp; Fibre cereal.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
Kemp&#x27;s best-known role is that of hard man Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Making his debut in February 1990, his character quickly became part of the soap&#x27;s key storylines during the 1990s, particularly troubled marriages to Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and then Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), as well as the &quot;Sharongate&quot; storyline, which saw brother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) having an affair with Grant&#x27;s wife, which was uncovered two years after it began.

Kemp announced on 24 March 1999 that he would be leaving the soap later that year after nearly 10 years. His exit was aired in October 1999 when his character moved to Brazil after surviving a car crash. Kemp refused to rule out an eventual return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, and various media reports over the next few years speculated that he would return to the series at some stage. In early 2005, the BBC confirmed that Kemp would be returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot; in the autumn of that year after six years away. It was co-star Barbara Windsor who convinced him to return, even though his comeback would only be a relatively brief one. His first comeback lasted just a few weeks from October 2005, but he returned again in March 2006, before departing once again in June that year.

In January 2016, it was confirmed that Kemp would make a brief return to the show for the death of Grant&#x27;s on-screen mother, Peggy Mitchell (played by Windsor), appearing in three episodes during May of that year. He later filmed a further three weeks and returned again for brief stints from 4 July to 9 September 2016. 

It was confirmed on 1 January 2025 that Kemp will reprise his role as Grant again in honour of the show&#x27;s upcoming 40th anniversary.

===Other roles===
Following his initial departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Kemp moved from the BBC to ITV for a reported £1.2 million two-year deal. Kemp&#x27;s first role for ITV was in &quot;Hero of the Hour&quot;. During its filming, on 27 October 1999, Kemp required hospital treatment after being shot in the face when a stunt went wrong. He suffered cuts to his chest and face after safety glass shattered, and was also hit in the face by the discharge from a blank round. He was treated at the scene by paramedics and made a full recovery.

In 2000, Kemp starred in ITV&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. He took the lead roles in the television series &quot;Without Motive&quot; and &quot;In Defence&quot; in 2000, and in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Force&quot;, where he played Army Staff sergeant Henry Garvie from the British Special Air Service. He continued to appear in this role until 2006. He also played &quot;Cirra&quot; in the 2004 TV film, &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

In 2005, Kemp appeared in an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Extras&quot; and in a two-part adaptation of the Gerald Seymour novel &quot;A Line in the Sand&quot; for ITV. He has also presented on &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; and appeared as a stand in host on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; (2007, 2008).

Kemp appeared in the 4th episode of Series 14 of BBC&#x27;s motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;. He was the &quot;Man in Boot&quot; of a Renault Twingo Sport being tested by Jeremy Clarkson. The test ended with Clarkson driving the car off the quayside of Belfast Harbour, after which Clarkson joked that Kemp had been killed. Kemp also appeared in Series 1, where he did a 1 minute 54 seconds (wet) in the &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment.

In 2022, Kemp began presenting the game show &quot;Bridge of Lies&quot;, airing on weekdays on BBC One, as well as a series of celebrity specials broadcast on Saturday evenings. Kemp told &quot;The Sunday Post&quot;: &quot;I am the last person that should be hosting a game show, but it seems to work [...] the landscape of TV has changed significantly in the last six, seven years. Actors once upon a time didn&#x27;t do commercials, now A-listers do them. If you worked in television, you couldn&#x27;t be in movies or if you were in movies you&#x27;d never touch TV [...] that snobbery I would suggest is dissolving. And that&#x27;s got to be a good thing I guess.&quot;

== Documentary presenter ==
In 2004, Kemp filmed &quot;Ross Kemp on Gangs&quot;. He followed this up with the documentaries &quot;Ross Kemp in Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Ross Kemp in Search of Pirates&quot;, &quot;Ross Kemp: Battle for the Amazon&quot; and &quot;Ross Kemp: Extreme World&quot;.

In 2022 Kemp, who had previously taken part in deep sea dives for the television channel Sky History, had planned to mark the 110th anniversary of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; by recording a documentary in which he would undertake a dive to the wreckage using the submersible &quot;Titan&quot;. The project was shelved after production company Atlantic Productions deemed the submersible to be unsafe and not &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.

In September 2024 Kemp launched a new documentary series &quot;Mafia and Britain&quot;.

==Writing==
Kemp has written several books. Initially focusing on tie-ins to his various TV documentaries, 2011 saw the publication of his first fictional story, &quot;Devil to Pay&quot;. A novel, &quot;Moving Target&quot;, was released in summer 2012. In September 2023, Kemp released &quot;Take Nothing For Granted: Tales from an Unexpected Life&quot;; a retrospective look back at his career.

==Political views==
In 1999, Kemp was elected as Rector of the University of Glasgow as the candidate of the Glasgow University Labour Club but did not attend local meetings. In October 2000 the Glasgow University Students&#x27; Representative Council passed a motion requesting him to resign, and within weeks he did. Kemp was the first rector in 50 years to leave the position prematurely and was succeeded by Scottish actor Greg Hemphill.

In August 2014, Kemp was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In June 2017, Kemp endorsed the Labour Party at the 2017 UK general election, and took part in campaigning for Labour candidates.

In 2022, Kemp declared his support for a &quot;National Thank You Day&quot; to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

In 2023, Kemp publicly endorsed Keir Mather of the Labour Party in the 2023 Selby and Ainsty by-election, of where he is a former resident. Mather subsequently won the by-election and was elected to Parliament.

In the 2024 general election, Kemp publicly endorsed Mark Francois of the Conservative Party. He described Francois as a &quot;fantastic MP&quot;. Francois kept his seat.

==Personal life==
On 11 June 2002, Kemp married Rebekah Wade, the then editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;. In November 2005, Wade was arrested following an alleged assault on her husband. Kemp refused medical attention for a swollen lip and no action was taken. In March 2009 Kemp and Wade divorced, and in October 2010, Kemp fathered a boy with his partner, Nicola Coleman, who was his make-up artist.

Kemp married the Australian Renee O&#x27;Brien in 2012. They have three children.

<text>The Sán Dìu (also known as San Deo, Trai, Trai Dat and Man Quan Coc; ; Chữ nôm: ; Vietnamese alphabet: Người Sán Dìu) are a Yao ethnic group in northern Vietnam who speak Yue Chinese (Cantonese), a Sinitic language. They are believed to have migrated from Guangdong, China around 1600.

The group&#x27;s estimated population as of 2000 was 117,500; the 2019 census put the number at 183,004. They speak a variant of Cantonese, and it is suggested that some still speak Iu Mien. The major religions are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism, with elements of animism and veneration of the dead. About 400 are adherents of the Catholic Church; a few are evangelical Protestants. This ethnic group is mainly concentrated around the Tam Đảo range in Thái Nguyên Province.

<text>The Mid-Autumn Festival (for other names, see § Etymology) is a harvest festival celebrated in Chinese culture. It is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar with a full moon at night, corresponding to mid-September to early October of the Gregorian calendar. On this day, the Chinese believe that the moon is at its brightest and fullest size, coinciding with harvest time in the middle of autumn.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture; its popularity is on par with that of Chinese New Year. The history of the festival dates back over 3,000 years. Similar festivals are celebrated by other cultures in East and Southeast Asia.

During the festival, lanterns of all size and shapeswhich symbolize beacons that light people&#x27;s path to prosperity and good fortuneare carried and displayed. Mooncakes, a rich pastry typically filled with sweet-bean, egg yolk, meat or lotus-seed paste, are traditionally eaten during this festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is based on the legend of Chang&#x27;e, the Moon goddess in Chinese mythology.

==Etymology==
The festival is so-named as it is held around the autumn equinox on the 15th of the 8th lunisolar month in the Chinese calendar. Its name varies among Sinitic languages, with the most common one being &quot;Mid-Autumn Festival&quot; or simply &quot;Mid-Autumn&quot; (), as well as its traditional calendar date, either &quot;Fifteenth of the Eighth Month&quot; or &quot;Half of the Eighth Month&quot;, which is more regional. Other regional names include &quot;Eighth Month Festival,&quot; used in places such as Northeast China, Southern Fujian, and Jianghuai; &quot;Festival of Unity&quot; (; Wugniu: &quot;doe2-yoe2-ciq7&quot;; Nanjingese: &quot;tuang2 üän2 zie5&quot;), used in Shanghai and Nanjing; and &quot;Mooncake Festival&quot; (), used in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Outside China, there are several other names for the festival:

* (), Korean festival celebrated on the same day in the Chinese and other East Asian lunisolar calendars.
* , Japanese variant of the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrated on the same day in the Chinese lunisolar calendar.
**Moon Festival or Harvest Moon Festival, because of the celebration&#x27;s association with the full moon on this night, as well as the traditions of Moon worship and Moon viewing.
* ( in Chữ Nôm), in Vietnam.
** Also known as The Children&#x27;s Festival in Vietnam. Most festival songs are sung by the children.
* Lantern Festival, a term sometimes used in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, which is not to be confused with the Lantern Festival in China that occurs on the 15th day of the first month of the Chinese calendar. 
** However, &#x27;Mid-Autumn Festival&#x27; is more widely used by locals when referring to the festival in English and &#x27;Zhōngqiū Jié&#x27; is used when referring to the festival in Chinese. 
* Bon Om Touk, or The Water and Moon Festival in Cambodian. The festival is held each year in November for 3 days.

==Meanings ==
The festival celebrates three fundamental concepts that are closely connected:
* &quot;Gathering&quot;: Such as family and friends coming together, or harvesting crops for the festival. It is said that the Moon is the brightest and roundest on this day which means family reunion. Consequently, this is the main reason why the festival is thought to be important.
* &quot;Giving thanks&quot;: To give thanks for the harvest, or for harmonious unions through activities like giving mooncakes to each other.
* &quot;Praying&quot; (asking for conceptual or material satisfaction): Praying for things such as babies, a spouse, beauty, longevity, or a good future

Traditions and myths surrounding the festival are formed around these concepts, although traditions have changed over time due to changes in technology, science, economy, culture, and religion.

==Origins and development==
The Chinese have celebrated the harvest during the autumn full moon since the Shang dynasty (–1046 BCE). The term &quot;mid-autumn&quot; (中秋) first appeared in &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;, a written collection of rituals of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE). As for the royal court, it was dedicated to the goddess Taiyinxingjun (). This is still true for Taoism and Chinese folk religion.

The celebration as a festival only started to gain popularity during the early Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). One legend explains that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang started to hold formal celebrations in his palace after having explored the Moon-Palace.

By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Mid-Autumn Festival had become one of the main folk festivals in China. The Empress Dowager Cixi (late 19th century) enjoyed celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival so much that she would spend the period between the thirteenth and seventeenth day of the eighth month staging elaborate rituals.

===Moon worship===

An important part of the festival celebration is Moon worship. The ancient Chinese believed in rejuvenation being associated with the Moon and water, and connected this concept to menstruation, calling it &quot;monthly water&quot;. The Zhuang people, for example, have an ancient fable saying the Sun and Moon are a couple and the stars are their children, and when the Moon is pregnant, it becomes round, and then becomes crescent after giving birth to a child. These beliefs made it popular among women to worship and give offerings to the Moon on this evening. In some areas of China, there are still customs in which the &quot;men do not worship the moon and the women do not offer sacrifices to the kitchen gods.&quot;

In China, the Mid-Autumn Festival symbolizes the family reunion and on this day, all families will appreciate the Moon in the evening, because it is the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar, when the moon is at its fullest.

Offerings are also made to a more well-known lunar deity, Chang&#x27;e, known as the Moon Goddess of Immortality. The myths associated with Chang&#x27;e explain the origin of Moon worship during this day. One version of the story is as follows, as described in Lihui Yang&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Chinese Mythology&quot;:

In the ancient past, there was a hero named Hou Yi who was excellent at archery. His wife was Chang&#x27;e. One year, the ten suns rose in the sky together, causing great disaster to the people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi did not want to leave Chang&#x27;e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang&#x27;e keep the elixir. However, Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the Chinese lunisolar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi&#x27;s house and forced Chang&#x27;e to give the elixir to him. Chang&#x27;e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang&#x27;e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang&#x27;e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.

&quot;when people learned of this story, they burnt incense on a long altar and prayed to Chang&#x27;e, now the goddess of the Moon, for luck and safety. The custom of praying to the Moon on Mid-Autumn Day has been handed down for thousands of years since that time.&quot;

&quot;Handbook of Chinese Mythology&quot; also describes an alternate common version of the myth:
After the hero Houyi shot down nine of the ten suns, he was pronounced king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from Xiwangmu. But his wife, Chang&#x27;e, stole it on the fifteenth of August because she did not want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang&#x27;e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang&#x27;e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang&#x27;e on every fifteenth day of eighth month to commemorate Chang&#x27;e&#x27;s action.

==Celebration==
The festival was a time to enjoy the successful reaping of rice and wheat with food offerings made in honor of the moon. Today, it is still an occasion for outdoor reunions among friends and relatives to eat mooncakes and watch the Moon, a symbol of harmony and unity. During a year of a solar eclipse, it is typical for governmental offices, banks, and schools to close extra days in order to enjoy the extended celestial celebration an eclipse brings. The festival is celebrated with many cultural or regional customs, among them:

* Burning incense in reverence to deities including Chang&#x27;e.
* Performance of dragon and lion dances, which is mainly practiced in southern China.

===Lanterns===
 

A notable part of celebrating the holiday is the carrying of brightly lit lanterns, lighting lanterns on towers, or floating sky lanterns. Another tradition involving lanterns is to write riddles on them and have other people try to guess the answers ().

It is difficult to discern the original purpose of lanterns in connection to the festival, but it is certain that lanterns were not used in conjunction with Moon-worship prior to the Tang dynasty. Traditionally, the lantern has been used to symbolize fertility, and functioned mainly as a toy and decoration. But today the lantern has come to symbolize the festival itself. In the old days, lanterns were made in the image of natural things, myths, and local cultures. Over time, a greater variety of lanterns could be found as local cultures became influenced by their neighbors.

As China gradually evolved from an agrarian society to a mixed agrarian-commercial one, traditions from other festivals began to be transmitted into the Mid-Autumn Festival, such as the putting of lanterns on rivers to guide the spirits of the drowned as practiced during the Ghost Festival, which is observed a month before. Hong Kong fishermen during the Qing dynasty, for example, would put up lanterns on their boats for the Ghost Festival and keep the lanterns up until Mid-Autumn Festival.

===Mooncakes===

Making and sharing mooncakes is one of the hallmark traditions of this festival. In Chinese culture, a round shape symbolizes completeness and reunion. Thus, the sharing and eating of round mooncakes among family members during the week of the festival signifies the completeness and unity of families. In some areas of China, there is a tradition of making mooncakes during the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The senior person in that household would cut the mooncakes into pieces and distribute them to each family member, signifying family reunion. In modern times, however, making mooncakes at home has given way to the more popular custom of giving mooncakes to family members, although the meaning of maintaining familial unity remains.

Although typical mooncakes can be around a few centimetres in diameter, imperial chefs have made some as large as 8 meters in diameter, with its surface pressed with designs of Chang&#x27;e, cassia trees, or the Moon-Palace. One tradition is to pile 13 mooncakes on top of each other to mimic a pagoda, the number 13 being chosen to represent the 13 months in a full Chinese lunisolar year. The spectacle of making very large mooncakes continues in modern China.

According to Chinese folklore, a Turpan businessman offered cakes to Emperor Taizong of Tang in his victory against the Xiongnu on the fifteenth day of the eighth Chinese lunisolar month. Taizong took the round cakes and pointed to the moon with a smile, saying, &quot;I&#x27;d like to invite the toad to enjoy the &quot;hú&quot; (胡) cake.&quot; After sharing the cakes with his ministers, the custom of eating these &quot;hú&quot; cakes spread throughout the country. Eventually these became known as mooncakes. Although the legend explains the beginnings of mooncake-giving, its popularity and ties to the festival began during the Song dynasty (906–1279 CE).

Another popular legend concerns the Han Chinese&#x27;s uprising against the ruling Mongols at the end of the Yuan dynasty (1280–1368 CE), in which the Han Chinese used traditional mooncakes to conceal the message that they were to rebel on Mid-Autumn Day. Because of strict controls upon Han Chinese families imposed by the Mongols in which only 1 out of every 10 households was allowed to own a knife guarded by a Mongolian, this coordinated message was important to gather as many available weapons as possible.

===Other foods and food displays===

Imperial dishes served on this occasion included nine-jointed lotus roots which symbolize peace, and watermelons cut in the shape of lotus petals which symbolize reunion. Teacups were placed on stone tables in the garden, where the family would pour tea and chat, waiting for the moment when the full moon&#x27;s reflection appeared in the center of their cups. Owing to the timing of the plant&#x27;s blossoms, cassia wine is the traditional choice for the &quot;reunion wine&quot; drunk on the occasion. Also, people will celebrate by eating cassia cakes and candy. In some places, people will celebrate by drinking osmanthus wine and eating osmanthus mooncakes.

Food offerings made to deities are placed on an altar set up in the courtyard, including apples, pears, peaches, grapes, pomegranates, melons, oranges, and pomelos. One of the first decorations purchased for the celebration table is a clay statue of the Jade Rabbit. In Chinese folklore, the Jade Rabbit was an animal that lived on the Moon and accompanied Chang&#x27;e. Offerings of soy beans and cockscomb flowers were made to the Jade Rabbit.

Nowadays, in southern China, people will also eat some seasonal fruit that may differ in different district but carrying the same meaning of blessing.

===Courtship and matchmaking===

The Mid-Autumn moon has traditionally been a choice occasion to celebrate marriages. Girls would pray to Moon deity Chang&#x27;e to help fulfill their romantic wishes.

In some parts of China, dances are held for young men and women to find partners. For example, young women are encouraged to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns the handkerchief has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in southwest Guizhou Province, young men and women of the Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.

===Games and activities===
During the 1920s and 1930s, ethnographer Chao Wei-pang conducted research on traditional games among men, women and children on or around the Mid-Autumn day in the Guangdong Province. These games relate to flights of the soul, spirit possession, or fortunetelling.

* One type of activity, &quot;Ascent to Heaven&quot; ( &quot;shàng tiāntáng&quot;) involves a young lady selected from a circle of women to &quot;ascend&quot; into the celestial realm. While being enveloped in the smoke of burning incense, she describes the beautiful sights and sounds she encounters.
* Another activity, &quot;Descent into the Garden&quot; ( &quot;luò huāyuán&quot;), played among younger girls, detailed each girl&#x27;s visit to the heavenly gardens. According to legend, a flower tree represented her, and the number and color of the flowers indicated the sex and number of children she would have in her lifetime.
* Men played a game called &quot;Descent of the Eight Immortals&quot; (&quot;jiangbaxian&quot;), where one of the Eight Immortals took possession of a player, who would then assume the role of a scholar or warrior.
* Children would play a game called &quot;Encircling the Toad&quot; (&quot;guanxiamo&quot;), where the group would form a circle around a child chosen to be a Toad King and chanted a song that transformed the child into a toad. He would jump around like a toad until water was sprinkled on his head, in which he would then stop.

==Practices by country or region==

=== Xiamen ===
A unique tradition is celebrated quite exclusively in the island city of Xiamen. During the festival, families and friends gather to play Bo Bing, a gambling sort of game involving 6 dice. People take turns in rolling the dice in a ceramic bowl with the results determining what they win. The number 4 is mainly what determines how big the prize is.

=== Hong Kong and Macau ===

In Hong Kong and Macau, the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday rather than the festival date itself (unless that date falls on a Sunday, then Monday is also a holiday), because many celebration events are held at night. Many businesses let employees off early on the day before. There are a number of festive activities such as lighting lanterns, but mooncakes are the most important feature there. However, people don&#x27;t usually buy mooncakes for themselves, but to give their relatives as presents. People start to exchange these presents well in advance of the festival. Hence, mooncakes are sold in elegant boxes for presentation purpose. Also, the price for these boxes are not considered cheap—a four-mooncake box of the lotus seeds paste with egg yolks variety, can generally cost US$40 or more. However, as environmental protection has become a concern of the public in recent years, many mooncake manufacturers in Hong Kong have adopted practices to reduce packaging materials to practical limits. The mooncake manufacturers also explore in the creation of new types of mooncakes, such as ice-cream mooncake and snow skin mooncake.

There are also other traditions related to the Mid-Autumn Festival in Hong Kong. Neighbourhoods across Hong Kong set impressive lantern exhibitions with traditional stage shows, game stalls, palm readings, and many other festive activities. The grandest celebrations take place in Victoria Park (Hong Kong). One of the brightest rituals is the Fire Dragon Dance dating back to the 19th century and recognised as a part of China&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage. The 200 foot-long fire dragon requires more than 300 people to operate, taking turns. The leader of the fire dragon dance would pray for peace, good fortune through blessings in Hakka. After the ritual ceremony, fire-dragon was thrown into the sea with lanterns and paper cards, which means the dragon would return to sea and take the misfortunes away.

Before 1941, there were also some celebration of Mid-Autumn Festival held in small villages in Hong Kong. Sha Po would celebrate Mid Autumn Festival in every 15th day of the 8th Chinese lunisolar month. People called the Mid-Autumn Festival the Kwong Sin Festival. They held Pok San Ngau Tsai at Datong Pond in Sha Po. Pok San Ngau Tsai was a celebration event of the Kwong Sin Festival, and people would gather around to watch it. During the event, someone would play the percussions, and some villagers would then act possessed and call themselves &quot;Maoshan Masters&quot;. They burnt themselves with incense sticks and fought with real blades and spears.

=== Ethnic minorities in mainland China ===
* Korean minorities living in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have a custom of welcoming the Moon, where they put up a large conical house frame made of dry pine branches called a &quot;moon house&quot;. The moonlight would shine inside for gazers to appreciate.
* The Bouyei people call the occasion &quot;Worshipping Moon Festival&quot;, where after praying to ancestors and dining together, they bring rice cakes to the doorway to worship the Moon Grandmother.
* The Tu people practice a ceremony called &quot;Beating the Moon&quot;, where they place a basin of clear water in the courtyard to reflect an image of the Moon, and then &quot;beat&quot; the water surface with branches.
* The Maonan people tie a bamboo near the table, on which a grapefruit is hung, with three lit incense sticks on it. This is called &quot;Shooting the Moon&quot;.

===Taiwan===
In Taiwan, and its outlying islands Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday. Outdoor barbecues have become a popular affair for friends and family to gather and enjoy each other&#x27;s company. Children also make and wear hats made of pomelo rinds. It is believed Chang&#x27;e, the lady in the moon, will notice children with her favorite fruit and bestow good fortune upon them. 

===Similar traditions in other countries===
Similar traditions are found in other parts of Asia and also revolve around the full moon. These festivals tend to occur on the same day or around the Mid-Autumn Festival.

====Southeast Asia====

Many festivals revolving around a full moon are also celebrated in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. Like the Mid-Autumn Festival, these festivals have Buddhist origins and revolve around the full moon. However, unlike their East Asian counterparts they occur several times a year to correspond with each full moon as opposed to one day each year. The festivals that occur in the lunar months of &quot;Ashvini&quot; and &quot;Kṛttikā&quot; generally occur during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

=====Cambodia=====
In Cambodia, it is more commonly called &quot;The Water and Moon Festival&quot; Bon Om Touk. The Water and Moon festival is celebrated in November of every year. It is a three-day celebration, starting with the boat race that last the first two days of the festival. The boat races are colorfully painted with bright colors and is in various designs being most popular the neak, Cambodian sea dragon. Hundreds of Cambodian males take part in rowing the boats and racing them at the Tonle Sap River. When night falls the streets are filled with people buying food and attending various concerts. In the evening is the Sampeah Preah Khae: the salutation to the moon or prayers to the moon. The Cambodian people set an array of offerings that are popular for rabbits, such and various fruits and a traditional dish called Ak Ambok in front of their homes with lit incenses to make wishes to the Moon. Cambodians believe the legend of The Rabbit and the Moon, and that a rabbit who lives on the Moon watches over the Cambodian people. At midnight everyone goes up to the temple to pray and make wishes and enjoy their Ak Ambok together. Cambodians would also make homemade lanterns that are usually made into the shape of the lotus flowers or other more modern designs. Incense and candles light up the lanterns and Cambodians make prayers and then send if off into the river for their wishes and prayers to be heard and granted.

=====Laos=====
In Laos, many festivals are held on the day of the full moon. The most popular festival known as &quot;That Luang Festival&quot; is associated with Buddhist legend and is held at Pha That Luang temple in Vientiane. The festival often lasts for three to seven days. A procession occurs and many people visit the temple.
=====Myanmar=====
In Myanmar, numerous festivals are held on the day of the full moon. However, the Thadingyut Festival is the most popular one and occurs in the month of Thadingyut. It also occurs around the time of the Mid-Autumn Festival, depending on the lunar calendar. It is one of the biggest festivals in Myanmar after the New Year festival, &quot;Thingyan&quot;. It is a Buddhist festival and many people go to the temple to pay respect to the monks and offer food. It is also a time for thanksgiving and paying homage to Buddhist monks, teachers, parents and elders.

=====Singapore=====
The mid-Autumn festival is informally observed, but is not a government or public holiday.

=====Vietnam=====
In Vietnam, children participate in parades in the dark under the full moon with lanterns of various forms, shapes, and colors. Traditionally, lanterns signified the wish for the Sun&#x27;s light and warmth to return after winter. In addition to carrying lanterns, the children also don masks. Elaborate masks were made of papier-mâché, though it is more common to find masks made of plastic nowadays. Handcrafted shadow lanterns were an important part of Mid-Autumn displays since the 12th-century Lý dynasty, often of historical figures from Vietnamese history. Handcrafted lantern-making declined in modern times due to the availability of mass-produced plastic lanterns, which often depict internationally recognizable characters from children&#x27;s shows and video games.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is known as (Chữ Nôm: ) in Vietnamese. It is also commonly referred to as the &quot;Children&#x27;s Festival&quot;. The Vietnamese traditionally believed that children, being the most innocent, had the closest connection to the sacred, pure and natural beauty of the world. The celebration of the children&#x27;s spirit was seen as a way to connect to that world still full of wonder, mystery, teachings, joy, and sadness. Animist spirits, deities and Vietnamese folk religions are also observed during the festival.

In its most traditional form, the evening commemorates the dragon who brings rain for the crops. Celebrants would observe the moon to divine the future of the people and the harvests. Eventually the celebration came to symbolize a reverence for fruitfulness, with prayers given for bountiful harvests, increase in livestock, and fertility. Over time, the prayers &quot;for&quot; children evolved into the celebration &quot;of&quot; children. Historical Confucian scholars continued the tradition of gazing at the Moon, but to sip wine and improvise poetry and song. However, by the early twentieth century in Hanoi, the festival had begun to assume its identity as the quintessential children&#x27;s festival.

Aside from the story of Chang&#x27;e (Vietnamese: Hằng Nga), there are two other popular folktales associated with the festival. The first describes the legend of &quot;Cuội&quot;, whose wife accidentally urinated on a sacred banyan tree. The tree began to float towards the Moon, and Cuội, trying to pull it back down to Earth, floated to the Moon with it, leaving him stranded there. Every year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, children light lanterns and participate in a procession to show Cuội the way back to Earth. The other tale involves a carp who wanted to become a dragon, and as a result, worked hard throughout the year until he was able to transform himself into a dragon.

One important event before and during the festival are lion dances. Dances are performed by both non-professional children&#x27;s groups and trained professional groups. Lion dance groups perform on the streets, going to houses asking for permission to perform for them. If the host consents, the &quot;lion&quot; will come in and start dancing as a blessing of luck and fortune for the home. In return, the host gives lucky money to show their gratitude. Cakes and fruits are not only consumed, but elaborately prepared as food displays. For example, glutinous rice flour and rice paste are molded into familiar animals. Pomelo sections can be fashioned into unicorns, rabbits, or dogs. Villagers of Xuân La, just north of Hanoi, produce &quot;tò he&quot;, figurines made from rice paste and colored with natural food dyes. Into the early decades of the twentieth century of Vietnam, daughters of wealthy families would prepare elaborate center pieces filled with treats for their younger siblings. Well-dressed visitors could visit to observe the daughter&#x27;s handiwork as an indication of her capabilities as a wife in the future. Eventually the practice of arranging centerpieces became a tradition not just limited to wealthy families.

Into the early decades of the twentieth century Vietnam, young men and women used the festival as a chance to meet future life companions. Groups would assemble in a courtyard and exchange verses of song while gazing at the Moon. Those who performed poorly were sidelined until one young man and one young woman remained, after which they would win prizes as well as entertain matrimonial prospects.

<text>The Good Son is a 1993 American psychological thriller film directed by Joseph Ruben, produced and released by 20th Century Fox. It was written by English novelist Ian McEwan. Its story follows a 12-year-old boy named Mark who, after the death of his mother, is sent to stay with his aunt and uncle while his father is away on a business trip. While there, he meets his cousin Henry, who shows signs of violent and evil behavior. It stars Macaulay Culkin, Elijah Wood, Wendy Crewson, David Morse, Daniel Hugh Kelly, and Jacqueline Brookes.

The film was produced by Joseph Ruben and Mary Ann Page and was released on September 24, 1993. It grossed $12.5 million during its opening weekend and $60.6 million worldwide, against a budget of $17 million. However, it received negative reviews from critics.

== Plot ==

Twelve-year-old Mark Evans has recently experienced the death of his mother, Janice. Before leaving on a business trip to Tokyo, Mark&#x27;s father, Jack, transports him from Arizona to his Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan&#x27;s house in Maine, where he will stay during winter break. Mark is reintroduced after a decade to his extended family, including his cousins Connie and Henry. Mark and Henry get along initially and Henry seems to be nice and well-mannered. However, Henry displays an abnormal fascination with death, making Mark feel uneasy.

Henry begins to display clear signs of psychopathic behavior, which Mark is unable to address to Wallace and Susan due to Henry&#x27;s threats. One of his violent actions is throwing a dummy he calls &#x27;Mr. Highway&#x27; off a bridge and onto a highway, causing a massive vehicle pileup. He then plans to kill Connie. Afraid something might happen to her, Mark spends the night in her room. The next morning, Mark awakens to find Henry has taken Connie ice skating. At the pond, Henry purposely throws her towards thin ice, which collapses. Connie is rescued, but ends up in a coma.

Even though Susan does not initially believe Mark, she becomes suspicious and interrupts Henry&#x27;s attempt to suffocate Connie in her hospital bed. Susan then finds a rubber duck that Henry has hidden in his shed — it had once belonged to Henry&#x27;s younger brother, Richard, and had been with him in the bathtub the night he drowned; the duck went missing after. When Susan confronts Henry, he coldly reminds her that the toy had belonged to him first. He then flips and kindly asks for the rubber duck back. After a violent tug-of-war, he takes the toy and throws it down the well.

As Susan and Mark grow closer, Henry insinuates that he will kill Susan rather than let Mark continue to develop a relationship with her. When a fight breaks out between Henry and Mark, Wallace locks Mark in the den. Henry asks a suspicious Susan to go for a walk with him, while Mark escapes and chases after them. Susan confronts Henry, asking him if he killed Richard, to which Henry sarcastically replies, &quot;What if I did?&quot; Susan realizes that Mark was right about Henry&#x27;s true nature. She tells Henry that he needs help, but he refuses and flees.

Susan gives chase and upon arriving at a cliff, Henry pushes her over the edge. As Susan dangles from a branch on the cliffside, Henry picks up a large rock to drop on her, but Mark tackles him. Susan manages to climb back up just in time to grab hold of the boys as they roll over the edge, one in each hand. Henry holds on with both hands but Mark&#x27;s one-handed grip begins to slip. With only enough strength to save one of them, Susan releases Henry and he falls to his death. Susan pulls Mark up and they look down at Henry&#x27;s corpse being washed away into the ocean.

When Mark returns home to Arizona, he reflects upon Susan&#x27;s choice to save him instead of Henry. He wonders if she would make the same choice again, but knows it is something that he will never ask her.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
Following the completion of his novel &quot;The Child in Time&quot;, English novelist Ian McEwan was invited by 20th Century Fox to write a screenplay &quot;about evil – possibly concerning children.&quot; McEwan recalled, &quot;The idea was to make a low budget, high class movie, not something that Fox would naturally make a lot of money on.&quot; Despite being well received, the end result was deemed insufficiently commercial by the parties that commissioned it and it floated around Hollywood until being discovered by independent producer Mary Ann Page. Enthusiastic about the script, which was originally sent to her as a writing sample, Page tried to get the project off the ground for three and a half years. The film was briefly set up at Universal Studios, during which Brian Gilbert was attached as director. In 1988, Michael Klesic was originally cast in the role of Henry Evans. The film was soon after put on hold due to a lack of funding.

Following the successes of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, which demonstrated the box-office appeal of a movie about kids and of an &quot;extreme thriller&quot; respectively, Fox itself chose to revisit the project, which they now saw as viable. Director Michael Lehmann (&quot;Heathers&quot;) became attached, Laurence Mark was appointed as a co-producer and McEwan was called in for rewrites. Mary Steenburgen was cast as Susan and Jesse Bradford had replaced Klesic as Henry because he had grown too old to play the part. McEwan was optimistic about the project and by November 1991, sets were being built in Maine for a production that would cost approximately $12 million. This progress was suddenly interrupted when Kit Culkin, Macaulay Culkin&#x27;s father and manager, at the time a notoriously influential force in Hollywood due to the child&#x27;s stardom, wanted his son to star in the film. Wishing to prove Macaulay&#x27;s capacity in a dark role, he made his son&#x27;s part in &quot;The Good Son&quot; a condition for his appearing in &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;. Fox agreed enthusiastically due to Culkin&#x27;s bankability.

As the movie was originally scheduled to shoot at the same time as &quot;Home Alone 2&quot;, the start date for &quot;The Good Son&quot; was pushed back for a year, making Steenburgen no longer available and having her replaced by Wendy Crewson but also enabling Elijah Wood&#x27;s involvement. Director Lehmann and producer Mark conflicted with the imposition, leading both to leave the project. The demanding Culkin would go on to insist that Macaulay&#x27;s sister, Quinn, receive a role in the film and vetted replacement director Joseph Ruben (&quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;). Furthermore, the budget had risen to an estimated $20 million. McEwan found himself performing further rewrites that continued to simplify the story to satisfy Ruben&#x27;s comparatively mainstream tastes and was ultimately unceremoniously removed from the project altogether when another screenwriter, Ruben&#x27;s frequent collaborator David Loughery, was commissioned. Despite this, McEwan was awarded sole writing credit in arbitration when he contested a shared credit.

Principal photography took place between November 1992 and February 1993. Interiors of the Evans household were filmed in Beverly, Massachusetts, while exteriors were filmed in the Manchester-by-the-Sea village in Cape Ann and the communities of Rockport, Essex, Annisquam, Danvers, Newington, Jackson and Marblehead. The climactic cliff scene was filmed at Lake Superior’s cliff, Palisade Head.

== Release ==
&quot;The Good Son&quot; was theatrically released on September 24, 1993. It was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1994. A DVD of the film was released on September 11, 2012. A Blu-ray release of &quot;The Good Son&quot; was announced on October 25, 2016 and was released on August 1, 2017.

Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score to &quot;The Good Son&quot; was released in 1993 by Fox Music. The score was orchestrated by Emilie A. Bernstein and Patrick Russ, and featured Cynthia Millar on ondes martenot.

A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie&#x27;s release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. The novel elaborates on the movie, detailing how Henry was born a sociopath, rather than being some personification of evil. In the novel, Henry&#x27;s mother Susan eventually discovers that Henry is unable to understand emotions like love and sorrow, and that pleasure derived from selfish actions and the torment of others are the few things he truly feels. The book also concludes differently from the movie, ending with Mark returning to Uncle Wallace&#x27;s home in Maine one year later. Mark and Susan visit Henry&#x27;s grave, which includes an epitaph: &quot;Without Darkness There Can Be No Light&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Good Son&quot; earned US$44,789,789 at the North American box office revenues, and another $15,823,219 in other territories, for a total worldwide box office take of $60,613,008.

=== Critics ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 25% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus stated: &quot;&quot;The Good Son&quot; is never good enough to live up to its unsettling potential, failing to drum up much suspense and unable to make Macaulay Culkin a credible psychopath.&quot; On Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, who deemed the film inappropriate for children, awarded it half a star, calling the project a &quot;creepy, unpleasant experience&quot;. He and Gene Siskel later gave it &quot;Two Thumbs Down&quot;. Many critics criticized the casting of Culkin because of his comedic image from &quot;Home Alone&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;the mere presence of the adorable boy star... seems to throw the whole film out of whack, making the picture play more like an inadvertent comedy than a thriller.&quot; Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the end sequence at the cliff &quot;is one of its few suspenseful and original moments&quot; and &quot;is quite literally gripping.&quot;

Paul Willinstein of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; described the film as &quot;&quot;Home Alone&quot; meets &quot;Misery&quot; meets &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;.&quot;

===Accolades===
=== Analysis ===
John Kenneth Muir in &quot;Horror Films of the 1990s&quot; wrote that the main difference between this and &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; was that the mother character manages to put an end to Henry&#x27;s misconduct, while in the latter the mother is unable to stop Rhoda Penmark.

<text>Glenn Thomas Jacobs (born April 26, 1967), also known by his ring name Kane, is an American politician, actor and professional wrestler. He rose to fame in WWE and is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. In 2018, he became the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee.

Jacobs began his professional wrestling career on the independent circuit in 1992, wrestling in promotions such as Smoky Mountain Wrestling and the United States Wrestling Association before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1995. He played various characters until 1997, when he was repackaged as the masked wrestler Kane, a horror-themed personification of fire and the juggernaut younger half-brother of the Undertaker and son of Paul Bearer.

Kane alternatively feuded and teamed with the Undertaker, the latter as the Brothers of Destruction. Following his WWF debut, he remained a pivotal component of the company&#x27;s Attitude Era of the late 1990s and early 2000s, defeating top star Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship in his first pay-per-view (PPV) main event at King of the Ring in June 1998. He continued to headline PPV cards over the next 20 years, with more PPV appearances than any other performer in WWF/WWE history besides Randy Orton.

In WWE, Kane won numerous championships; he is a three-time world champion (having held the WWF Championship, ECW Championship and World Heavyweight Championship once each), a 12-time world tag team champion (having held the World Tag Team Championship, WCW Tag Team Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship), and a WWE Grand Slam Champion. Kane currently also holds several records at the Royal Rumble, including the record for the most appearances in a Royal Rumble match at 20, the quickest elimination of another competitor at 1.9 seconds and the highest cumulative total eliminations at 46, a record held since the 2015 Royal Rumble match. Kane was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2021.

A long-term supporter of libertarian political causes, in March 2017, Jacobs announced that he was running for the mayoral seat of Knox County, Tennessee as a Republican. He won the Republican primary election on May 1, 2018, and the general election on August 2, 2018. He was reelected on August 4, 2022.

Jacobs made numerous appearances in film and on television, including the lead role in the 2006 WWE Studios production &quot;See No Evil&quot; and its 2014 sequel.

== Early life ==
Jacobs was born in the Spanish town of Torrejón de Ardoz to a United States Air Force family that was stationed in Spain at the time of his birth. He grew up in the United States near St. Louis, Missouri, and attended high school in Bowling Green, Missouri, where he excelled in football and basketball. He went on to earn a degree in English literature at Northeast Missouri State University, where he played both basketball and football.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1992–1995) ===
Jacobs was trained by Dean Malenko, Ray Candy, and Jeff Bradley. He debuted in 1992 under the ring name &quot;Angus King&quot; for the Central States Wrestling Association in Hannibal, Missouri, which was owned and run by his childhood friend Mark Morton. In December 1992, he joined the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in Memphis, Tennessee, appearing as the &quot;Christmas Creature,&quot; an &quot;evil Christmas character&quot; who wore a garish costume (made by Jacobs&#x27;a mother) featuring a green mask, candy cane-striped sleeves, and tinsel. The Christmas Creature unsuccessfully challenged Jerry Lawler for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship before leaving the USWA later that month.

In March 1993, Jacobs made a one-off appearance with World Championship Wrestling, losing to Sting on an episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot; filmed in Macon, Georgia, under the ring name Bruiser Mastino. Later that year, he relocated to Tampa, Florida, in order to further his training. During his time in Florida, he wrestled a handful of matches for the International Championship Wrestling Alliance as &quot;Sid Powers&quot;. After leaving Florida, he returned to the USWA as &quot;Doomsday.&quot; On October 10, 1993, he wrestled in a dark match for the World Wrestling Federation under his real name, defeating Mike Bell at a &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; taping in Burlington, Vermont. In December 1993, he wrestled in Japan for Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi under his real name.

In 1994, Jacobs began wrestling for Tri-State Wrestling promotion in Central City, Kentucky, and the Indianapolis-based Championship Wrestling as Doomsday, as well as making a handful of further appearances with Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi in Japan. In May 1994, he relocated to Puerto Rico to wrestle for the World Wrestling Council as Doomsday, where he feuded with Invader 1. In November and December 1994, Jacobs wrestled for the Catch Wrestling Association in Germany as &quot;Spartacus&quot;, competing in its Catch Cup tournament.

=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1995) ===
In January 1995, Jacobs was hired by Jim Cornette for his Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) promotion in Morristown, Tennessee, where he was named &quot;Unabomb&quot; (a reference to the Unabomber). He briefly teamed with Eddie Gilbert before forming a tag team with Al Snow named the Dynamic Duo and beginning a feud with the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express. In April 1995, at the Bluegrass Brawl III event, the Dynamic Duo defeated the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express in a coal miner&#x27;s glove match for the SMW Tag Team Championship (Jacobs&#x27; first championship). They held the titles until July 1995, when they lost to the Thugs. Later that month, the feud between the Dynamic Duo and the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express culminated in a street fight at Summer Blast 1995, with the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express victorious. On August 4, 1995, at the Superbowl of Wrestling event, Jacobs lost to World Wrestling Federation wrestler The Undertaker, who was making a special appearance with SMW. He made his final appearance with SMW at the following month&#x27;s Fire on the Mountain 1995 event, with the Thugs defeating the Dynamic Duo in a loser leaves town match.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE ===
==== Early years (1995–1997) ====
Jacobs appeared with WWE (then the World Wrestling Federation or WWF) as &quot;Mike Unabomb&quot; at the February 20, 1995 &quot;Raw&quot; taping, defeating Reno Riggins in a dark match. He wrestled intermittently as Unabomb through August.

Jacobs made his first television appearance with the company as &quot;Isaac Yankem, DDS&quot;, Jerry Lawler&#x27;s private dentist, in a vignette on the June 26, 1995 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Placing emphasis on Jacobs&#x27; imposing height and weight, Yankem was portrayed as a monstrous figure whom Lawler had hired for the purpose of ridding the WWF of his long-time nemesis, Bret Hart. The character&#x27;s in-ring debut occurred at a &quot;Superstars&quot; taping on August 15, where Jacobs lost to Hart by count-out. At that month&#x27;s SummerSlam event, Yankem was disqualified when he hung Hart by twisting him in the top and middle ropes by his neck. He lost to Hart in a steel cage match in the main event of the October 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and finally in a tag team match against Hart and Hakushi, in which he was partnered with Lawler on November 6. After his initial run with Hart, Jacobs was part of an unsuccessful team in an elimination match at November&#x27;s Survivor Series and participated in the 1996 Royal Rumble match in January. The remainder of Yankem&#x27;s televised run through April included losses to The Undertaker, Jake Roberts, Marc Mero and The Ultimate Warrior. Jacobs was used on a series of live events in Kuwait in May, as well as a September tour of South Africa, after which the Yankem gimmick was retired.

In September 1996, play-by-play announcer Jim Ross introduced Jacobs as Diesel, and Rick Bognar as Razor Ramon, as part of a heavily criticized storyline mocking the departure of former employees Kevin Nash and Scott Hall respectively, while attempting to portray Ross as a disgruntled employee. The pair competed primarily as a tag team, losing a WWF Tag Team Championship match to titleholders Owen Hart and The British Bulldog at December&#x27;s In Your House 12: It&#x27;s Time. As Diesel, he lost to The Undertaker via disqualification in the main event of the December 22 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot; and defeated Marc Mero on &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot; on January 11, 1997. Diesel and Ramon last appeared on television at the 1997 Royal Rumble, where Jacobs was the third-to-last participant. Jacobs continued to work sporadic live events as Diesel through April. In May he and Razor Ramon went to Mexico to work for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide. On June 24, 1997, Jacobs lost to Razor Ramon in a Loser Leaves Town match at USWA. In July 1997, Jacobs briefly returned to the United States Wrestling Association as Doomsday, winning the USWA Heavyweight Championship from Spellbinder. He then dropped the title to Steven Dunn on September 6.

==== Emergence of Kane; WWF Champion (1997–1998) ====
In April 1997, the WWF &quot;slowly and meticulously&quot; began building up to the debut of Jacobs&#x27;s new character Kane, a horror-themed juggernaut and hellish personification of everything relating to fire. The character&#x27;s theme and persona is rooted in acts of arson by his older half-brother, The Undertaker, that occurred during their youth. Rounding out his &quot;Hellfire and Brimstone&quot; gimmick, Kane was combined with the Inferno match, a specialty match personalized to him.

At In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker on April 20, The Undertaker launched a fireball into the face of his former manager, Paul Bearer, who had previously had his protégé Mankind do the same to The Undertaker prior to the event. On the May 12 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mankind reintroduced Bearer, who attempted to reunite with Undertaker because of his status as WWF Champion. This was all following a long period of mutual hostility between the two. After The Undertaker&#x27;s adamant refusals, Bearer used the ultimatum of revealing The Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;deepest, darkest secret&quot; to the world in order to coerce him into being his protégé. The Undertaker begrudgingly acceded to Bearer&#x27;s wishes for a few months but eventually lost his patience with Bearer&#x27;s abrasive management of him and rejected all association with him. Bearer responded by publicly revealing that his long-lost brother, Kane (later revealed as Bearer&#x27;s illegitimate son and the Undertaker&#x27;s half-brother), was coming to the WWF to challenge him. In sharing this news, Bearer disclosed that The Undertaker had started a fire at his family&#x27;s funeral home, in effect murdering his family. Kane, who The Undertaker thought long dead from the incident, was left physically and mentally scarred. Undertaker claimed Kane, a pyromaniac, started the fire and could not possibly have survived (in October 1998 Undertaker confessed to purposely burning down the home in attempt to murder Kane).

Kane debuted at Badd Blood: In Your House on October 5, using The Undertaker&#x27;s signature tombstone piledriver to cost him the victory in the first Hell in a Cell match against Shawn Michaels. In keeping with the notion that Kane had been burned and scarred by the fire—and to conceal Jacobs&#x27;s identity—the character wore a mask, sported long hair, and wore red and black ring attire that almost covered his entire body. Kane and The Undertaker feuded with one another over the following year, during which time their history vis-à-vis one another was expounded. Jacobs won his first match as Kane against Mankind at Survivor Series on November 9. The Undertaker initially refused to face him and adamantly so while Kane humiliated him, The Undertaker claiming he had promised his parents he would never do harm to his own &quot;flesh and blood.&quot; After what was thought to be a brief partnership, Kane betrayed The Undertaker by costing him the WWF Championship, Kane interfering in The Undertaker&#x27;s title match against Shawn Michaels at the Royal Rumble on January 18, 1998. After the match, Kane locked The Undertaker in a casket and set it on fire. After a couple months of absence, The Undertaker resurrected on an episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, in which he was reproduced from a coffin that was struck by lightning, in this moment furiously challenging Kane.

The Undertaker defeated Kane at WrestleMania XIV on March 29. After the match, Kane and Paul Bearer attacked The Undertaker, hitting him with a steel chair and then giving a Tombstone Piledriver. On April 4, they faced each other again at Mayhem in Manchester, where the Undertaker defeated Kane again. They continued to feud until on April 26, when The Undertaker defeated Kane in the first ever Inferno match. In this match, Bearer tried to help Kane by attacking Undertaker, but as Kane was retreating backstage, Vader forced Kane back towards the ring, and The Undertaker attacked them both by jumping over the ring ropes surrounded by fire before setting Kane&#x27;s right arm on fire. At Over the Edge: In Your House on May 31, Kane defeated Vader in a Mask vs. Mask match.

On the June 1 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Kane defeated The Undertaker to become the number one contender to the WWF Championship. At the King of the Ring on June 28, Kane defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin in a First Blood match following interferences by Mankind and The Undertaker to win the WWF Championship. Kane lost the title back to Austin the following night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;.

==== The Brothers of Destruction (1998–2001) ====

In June, Kane formed a tag team with Mankind, with whom he won the WWF Tag Team Championship twice that summer. After dissension between the partners saw their second reign end at SummerSlam on August 30, Kane broke away from Mankind and allied with The Undertaker, with the duo being known as the Brothers of Destruction. At on September 27, Kane, The Undertaker, and Stone Cold Steve Austin competed in a triple threat match for Austin&#x27;s WWF Championship; Kane and The Undertaker were prohibited from pinning each other, so they pinned Austin at the same time. The half-brothers fought one another for the vacant WWF Championship at Judgment Day: In Your House on October 18, with the match ending in a no contest when special guest referee Austin counted a double pinfall and declared himself the winner; during the match, The Undertaker betrayed Kane for Paul Bearer, turning Kane face. At Rock Bottom: In Your House on December 13, Kane interfered in the Buried Alive match between Austin and The Undertaker, attacking The Undertaker and costing him the match. As a result, The Corporation had Kane committed to an insane asylum. In December, Kane joined The Corporation to stay out of the insane asylum. During this time, Kane aligned himself with Chyna and feuded with Triple H. At WrestleMania XV on March 28, 1999, Kane was betrayed by Chyna and thrown out of The Corporation.

Kane then formed a tag team with X-Pac and acquired a girlfriend, Tori. While teaming with X-Pac, Kane evolved from being mute to aided speech through an electrolarynx to speaking unaided. He also became associated with D-Generation X (DX), the faction of which X-Pac was a member. His first unaided words were the DX slogan &quot;suck it&quot;. The duo won the WWF Tag Team Championship twice. The tag team broke apart when X-Pac turned on Kane and rejoined DX. Kane and X-Pac then engaged in a lengthy feud against each other, which was exacerbated in early 2000, when Tori betrayed Kane and joined X-Pac and DX, leading to Kane briefly reuniting with Paul Bearer. With Bearer once again by his side, Kane proceeded to terrorize DX at every opportunity he could, once forcing the group to send Rikishi after Kane to stop him. The former partners&#x27; feud eventually ended at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, where Kane teamed with Rikishi to defeat X-Pac and Road Dogg.

Kane returned on the May 29 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, when he helped The Undertaker and The Rock fight off the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. His involvement in this feud culminated in a main event match at King of the Ring on June 25 against Vince and Shane McMahon, and then-champion Triple H. The Undertaker and Kane&#x27;s rivalry resurfaced during the match, but they patched their relationship up soon after. Kane later turned heel by assaulting The Undertaker, leading to a match between the two at SummerSlam on August 27. The match ended when The Undertaker removed Kane&#x27;s mask, causing him to flee the ring, covering his exposed face. Kane stayed in contention for the WWF Championship for the remainder of the year and ended 2000 in a feud with Chris Jericho; Kane defeated him at Survivor Series on November 19 and again at Rebellion on December 2, but he ultimately lost to Jericho in a Last Man Standing match at Armageddon on December 10.

Kane turned face once again by reforming his alliance with The Undertaker immediately after the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001, in which he eliminated 11 wrestlers and was the runner-up, after being eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. Kane competed for the Hardcore Championship, defeating Raven for the title at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 in a triple threat match that also featured Big Show, later losing the title to Rhyno on the April 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Kane and The Undertaker began teaming as The Brothers of Destruction, and in the course of the year they feuded with Edge and Christian, Rikishi and Haku, and The Two-Man Power Trip. At Judgment Day on May 20, Kane defeated Triple H to win the Intercontinental Championship. Kane lost the title to Albert on the June 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; following interference from Diamond Dallas Page. During The Invasion, Kane and The Undertaker feuded with Page and Kanyon after Page began stalking The Undertaker&#x27;s wife Sara. The feud culminated at SummerSlam on August 19, where they defeated Page and Kanyon in a steel cage match, resulting in them holding both the WWF Tag Team and the WCW Tag Team Championships. Kane and The Undertaker defeated KroniK at Unforgiven on September 23 to retain the WCW Tag Team Championship and both participated in the ten-man Winner-Takes-All match at Survivor Series on November 18 as members of the victorious Team WWF.

==== Unmasking (2002–2004) ====

On March 25, 2002, the WWF was divided into two brands, Raw and SmackDown!, with Kane being drafted to Raw. Kane shortly feuded with the New World Order (nWo) and began acting human by talking through his mask and referring to his fans as &quot;Kanenites&quot;. Kane returned to the renamed WWE as part of the Raw roster in August, with a new outfit and half-mask where his facial hair was shown. On the September 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane and The Hurricane won the WWE Tag Team Championship after defeating The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian). The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane won the Intercontinental Championship from Chris Jericho, despite interference from Triple H and Ric Flair. On the October 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane successfully single-handedly defended the World Tag Team Championship in a four-team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, as The Hurricane had been attacked earlier that evening by Triple H and Ric Flair and was unable to compete. That match was later nominated as WWE&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Match of the Year&quot;. Kane and The Hurricane lost the World Tag Team Championship to Chris Jericho and Christian the following week on &quot;Raw&quot;.

Also in October, Kane began feuding with Triple H, leading to a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship and Triple H&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He claimed that after Vick was killed in a car crash, Kane had sex with her. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question. The footage that finally aired showed Triple H (dressed as Kane) simulating mock sex with a mannequin in a casket; Kane&#x27;s tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasised before the title match. Triple H defeated Kane at No Mercy, due to Triple H and Flair cheating, unifying the two titles. On the October 28 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane defeated Triple H in a non-title Casket match to end their feud. At Survivor Series on November 17, Kane participated in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Shawn Michaels.

Kane then formed a tag team with Rob Van Dam, with the duo eventually winning the World Tag Team Championship from Chief Morley and Lance Storm in a triple threat elimination match (also involving The Dudley Boyz) on the March 31, 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. After they lost their World Tag Team Championship to La Résistance at Bad Blood on June 15, Triple H offered Kane a spot in his stable Evolution. Raw co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin offered Kane the opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship if he rejected Triple H&#x27;s offer. Co-general manager Eric Bischoff insisted that if Kane lost the match, he would unmask. Kane accepted Austin&#x27;s offer and challenged Triple H the following week in Madison Square Garden. Triple H won the match following interference from his stablemates, and on the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane removed his mask and chokeslammed Van Dam, turning heel in the process. The unmasking rendered Kane emotionally unstable, and in an interview with Jim Ross on the July 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane attacked Ross and set him on fire. He later attacked Linda McMahon on the &quot;Raw&quot; stage the following week. This action sparked a feud between Kane and Shane McMahon, Linda&#x27;s son, with Kane defeating Shane in a Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven on September 21 and an ambulance match at Survivor Series on November 16. At Survivor Series, Kane also interfered in a Buried Alive match between Vince McMahon and The Undertaker, helping McMahon bury The Undertaker and win the match. On January 25, 2004, Kane took part in the Royal Rumble match; he was eliminated when he heard the bell toll from The Undertaker&#x27;s entrance music, distracting and distressing Kane, and enabling Booker T to eliminate him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was &quot;dead&quot;, only to be met with various paranormal incidents such as a rainstorm localized over the ring in which he stood. The Undertaker finally returned at WrestleMania XX on March 14 (again sporting his &quot;Deadman&quot; persona) with Paul Bearer at his side, defeating Kane.

==== Storyline with Lita (2004–2005) ====

After losing at WrestleMania XX, Kane fell in love with Lita, but was spurned. This led to him kidnapping Lita in May, and on the same night, Kane won a 20-man battle royal for a World Heavyweight Championship match against Chris Benoit at Bad Blood on June 13. Six days before Bad Blood in a handicap tag team match between Kane and La Resistance against Edge and Benoit, Kane pinned Benoit, then lost to him at Bad Blood. Lita later announced that she was pregnant, with Matt Hardy her then-boyfriend both on- and off-screen, assuming that he was the child&#x27;s father. On the June 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane claimed that he was the father. The next week, he explained that he had impregnated Lita to continue his legacy and justified an attack on Shawn Michaels a week earlier by claiming that Michaels had stood in the way of him winning the World Heavyweight Championship. To appease Kane, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane a rematch with Benoit, instructing Benoit that he could only win by submission, whereas Kane could win the title by any means. Kane again lost to Benoit, and following the match, Lita came to the ring and low-blowed Kane, who initially went to chokeslam her in revenge, but stopped when he realized that she was trying to force him to cause her to miscarry their child.

Kane and Matt Hardy faced one another in a &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; match at SummerSlam on August 15, with Lita obliged to wed the victor. Kane defeated Hardy at SummerSlam, and &quot;married&quot; Lita on the August 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Although he was attacked by Hardy during the ceremony, he gained the upper hand and ultimately chokeslammed Hardy off the stage. A week after the wedding, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane and Lita the wedding gift of choosing any match that Kane wanted at Unforgiven on September 12. Shawn Michaels was chosen and defeated Kane in a no-disqualification match at Unforgiven. The next night, on the September 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane accidentally fell on Lita during a match with the debuting Gene Snitsky, who hit him on the back with a steel chair, ostensibly causing Lita to miscarry. Kane turned face by seeking revenge against Snitsky for causing the death of his child but lost to Snitsky in a steel chain match (which was selected by the fans) at Taboo Tuesday on October 19. Kane was sidelined for several months after Snitsky crushed his larynx with a chair during the match. This storyline gave Jacobs time to complete his role in the film, &quot;See No Evil&quot;.

Kane returned by defeating Snitsky at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 9, 2005. Kane and Lita reconciled with one another and began antagonizing Lita&#x27;s rival Trish Stratus. This led to a match between Kane and Stratus&#x27; hired bodyguard Viscera at Backlash on May 1 that was won by Kane. Lita later turned on Kane and started an on-screen relationship with her real-life boyfriend at the time Edge. This led to a feud between Kane and Edge, whom Kane defeated at Vengeance on June 26 despite interference from Snitsky. The feud ended when Edge defeated Kane in a Stretcher match on the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==== Teaming with Big Show (2005–2006) ====
Kane returned to WWE television on the October 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, winning an 18-man battle royal. As a result of his victory, he, along with Big Show and Shawn Michaels, was featured in an Internet poll to decide who would receive a shot at the WWE Championship at Taboo Tuesday on November 1. In the weeks before Taboo Tuesday, Kane and Big Show teamed together on several occasions. The poll was won by Michaels, and Kane and Big Show teamed together to face Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, defeating them for the World Tag Team Championship. The duo successfully retained their championship throughout the remainder of 2005, during which time they engaged in an inter-promotional feud with members of the SmackDown! brand. On the December 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane defeated Triple H in an Elimination Chamber qualifying match, then Kane participated in the Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 8, 2006, but he was eliminated by Carlito and Chris Masters. He and Big Show feuded with Carlito and Masters throughout early 2006, culminating in a successful title defense at WrestleMania 22 on April 2. The following evening, Kane and the Big Show lost the World Tag Team Championship to Spirit Squad members Kenny and Mikey. One week later, Kane and Big Show faced Spirit Squad members Johnny and Nicky in a rematch for the title, but were disqualified after Kane &quot;snapped&quot;, ostensibly due to &quot;voices in his head&quot;.

In subsequent weeks, Kane began attacking anyone who mentioned the date May 19. During the match between Kane and Big Show at Backlash on April 30, Kane&#x27;s voice began echoing throughout the arena saying &quot;May 19th&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s happening again&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re all going to know&quot;, leaving Kane visibly shaken. Big Show then struck Kane with a chair, resulting in a no contest. On May 19, Kane appeared on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL)&#x27;s hand-picked opponent for Rey Mysterio. After the aforementioned voices and mask video began playing, Kane chokeslammed JBL and Mysterio, before leaving the ring. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, he claimed that May 19 was the date on which his mother and adopted family were killed in a fire. The voices continued to the May 29 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Kane was confronted by the source of the voice, an impostor Kane; wearing Kane&#x27;s old mask and ring attire, he chokeslammed Kane during his match against Shelton Benjamin for the Intercontinental Championship. Kane and the look-alike continued to fight one another in subsequent weeks, leading to a match between the two being scheduled for Vengeance on June 25, in which the real Kane lost to the impostor. On the June 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane threw the impostor out of the arena and removed his mask, saying &quot;I believe that this is mine&quot;. Kane was absent from WWE television for two months thereafter as he toured Europe to promote &quot;See No Evil&quot;.

Kane returned at SummerSlam on August 20, attacking Umaga, who was interfering in the D-Generation-X versus Mr. McMahon and Shane McMahon tag team match. Upon his return, he faced his former partner Big Show for the ECW World Championship in a losing effort. Soon after, Kane would engage in a major feud with Umaga that concluded on the October 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a Loser Leaves Raw match, which he lost.

==== Brothers of Destruction reunion (2006–2007) ====

On the October 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane moved to the SmackDown! brand. On the November 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane reunited with The Undertaker as The Brothers of Destruction to defeat Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mr. Kennedy. Kane continued a feud with MVP competing in several gimmick matches. The result of the feud was an Inferno match at Armageddon on December 17; Kane won by setting MVP&#x27;s back on fire which resulted in first degree burns. On the January 26, 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane was involved in a six-man elimination over-the-top-rope battle royal, with King Booker, MVP, The Miz, Chris Benoit, and Finlay. This match went to a no-contest as The Undertaker interrupted after Kane had been eliminated and punished by the remaining opponents.

At the Royal Rumble on January 28, Kane eliminated King Booker, who re-entered the ring and eliminated him. On the February 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, while receiving the key to the city in his hometown of Houston, King Booker was attacked by Kane starting a feud between the two. At No Way Out on February 18, Kane defeated King Booker. On the February 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane lost to King Booker in a Falls Count Anywhere Money in the Bank Qualifying match after interference from The Great Khali, sparking a feud between the two. Kane started to walk around with a hook, similar to the hook he used as Jacob Goodnight in &quot;See No Evil&quot;. At WrestleMania 23 on April 1, Kane lost to Khali. During the match, in homage to Hulk Hogan slamming André the Giant twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III, Kane picked up Khali for the first time and body-slammed him to the mat.

After WrestleMania, he began to feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. The Boogeyman then joined the feud, teaming up with Kane. On the May 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane competed in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the United States Championship against MVP. Kane lost due to interference by Regal and Taylor. On the May 25 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Kane competed in a fatal four-way number one contender&#x27;s match for the World Heavyweight Championship which was won by Batista. Kane then entered a short feud with Mark Henry, losing to him in a Lumberjack match at One Night Stand on June 3 due to interference from lumberjacks Kenny Dykstra and Chavo Guerrero and then took a short hiatus. On the July 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, General Manager Theodore Long announced that Kane would face Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash on July 22. After Edge was attacked and injured by Kane and the title was vacated, Batista faced Kane in a number one contender&#x27;s match on the July 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. During the match, new World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali interfered by attacking Batista; the match was ruled a no-contest and both men were ruled the number one contenders and were scheduled to face Khali in a triple threat match at The Great American Bash. Khali retained the title after pinning Kane for the win at The Great American Bash. Kane later teamed up with Batista on the August 18 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; to defeat Khali and Finlay. Kane then entered a storyline with Finlay, which led to a match at SummerSlam on August 26, which Kane won after chokeslamming Finlay. They continued to feud, which included Kane losing to Finlay in a number one contender&#x27;s tournament on the August 31 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; after interference from Hornswoggle.

Kane then made an appearance on the October 16 episode of &quot;ECW&quot; as the hand-chosen partner of ECW Champion CM Punk, helping him defeat John Morrison, The Miz, and Big Daddy V in a three-on-two handicap match. In retaliation, Big Daddy V attacked Kane on the October 19 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, igniting a feud between the two. The two continued to battle in the following weeks. Kane was voted to face the defending champion MVP for his United States Championship at Cyber Sunday on October 28, which Kane won by countout and thus did not win the title. After this, he continued to feud with Big Daddy V, with the two ending up on opposite teams at Survivor Series on November 18, where Kane&#x27;s team won. Big Daddy V eventually began to team with Mark Henry, while Kane teamed with CM Punk. The feud concluded at Armageddon on December 16, where Kane and Punk lost to Big Daddy V and Henry after Big Daddy V pinned Punk.

==== ECW Champion (2008–2009) ====
In a battle royal before WrestleMania XXIV on March 30, 2008, Kane won by last eliminating former rival Mark Henry, earning a match for the ECW Championship against Chavo Guerrero later that night. Kane defeated Guerrero in the second fastest WrestleMania match with a record-setting eleven seconds to win the ECW Championship. Shortly after winning the championship, Kane officially joined the ECW brand. At Backlash on April 27, Kane successfully defended the ECW Championship against Guerrero. He then continued teaming with CM Punk to earn a WWE Tag Team Championship match at Judgment Day on May 18, which they lost to John Morrison and The Miz. On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as part of the 2008 WWE Draft, Kane was drafted to the Raw brand, making the ECW Championship exclusive to Raw. Kane lost the ECW Championship to Mark Henry at Night of Champions on June 29 in a triple threat match that also involved Big Show.

On the July 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane lost a number one contender&#x27;s fatal four-way match to Batista (Batista would advance to the World Heavyweight Championship match at The Great American Bash on July 20), leading him to attack commentators Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler, thus turning heel in the process. At The Great American Bash, Kane interfered and attacked both the champion CM Punk and the challenger Batista, causing the match to end in a double disqualification. In September, Kane began a feud with Rey Mysterio that lasted through Survivor Series on November 23. On the March 2, 2009 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Kane pinned Mike Knox in a triple threat match, also involving Rey Mysterio, to earn a spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 25 on April 5, a match ultimately won by CM Punk. During the 2009 draft Kane beat The Brian Kendrick for a draft pick and, later in the night, was drafted to the SmackDown brand. There, Kane feuded with CM Punk and defeated him at Backlash on April 26. He then took a break to tour India and also heal injuries, returning at The Bash on June 28 to assist Dolph Ziggler in his match with The Great Khali by hitting Khali with a steel chair, allowing Ziggler to win. This started a feud with Khali, whom he defeated at SummerSlam on August 23 and in a Singapore Cane match at Breaking Point on September 13. Alongside Chris Jericho, Kane was co-captain for the victorious Team SmackDown at Bragging Rights on October 25. On the October 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Kane then unsuccessfully challenged Jericho in a number one contender&#x27;s match for an opportunity to face World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker and Big Show in a triple threat match at Survivor Series on November 22. In November, Kane reunited with The Undertaker to feud with Big Show and Jericho, thus turning face.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2010–2011) ====
At WrestleMania XXVI on March 28, 2010, during the Money in the Bank ladder match, Kane was unsuccessful in claiming the briefcase as Jack Swagger won the match. Over the next few months, Kane was involved in sporadic singles matches on episodes of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, including a loss to CM Punk in May in a qualifying match for the World Heavyweight Championship match for the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view event on June 20. On the June 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Kane stated he had found his brother The Undertaker in a &quot;vegetative state&quot; over Memorial Day weekend and vowed revenge on whoever was responsible. Due to Undertaker&#x27;s injury, a battle royal was held to determine his replacement for Fatal 4-Way, which Rey Mysterio won by last eliminating Kane. Mysterio would go on to win the match at Fatal 4-Way. Kane participated in the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at the first Money in the Bank pay-per-view on July 18. He won the match, and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract later that night, defeating Rey Mysterio (who had just defeated Jack Swagger) to win the World Heavyweight Championship, thus making Kane the first wrestler in WWE history to win the WWE Championship, the ECW Championship, and the World Heavyweight Championship. He became the first wrestler to cash in the Money in the Bank contract on the same night it was won and also holds the record for the fastest cash in at 47 minutes. On the next &quot;SmackDown&quot; on July 23, Kane accused Mysterio of putting The Undertaker in a vegetative state; Mysterio countered the accusations, claiming that Kane himself was the perpetrator. At SummerSlam on August 15, Kane retained the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, and following their match, The Undertaker appeared. Kane was revealed as The Undertaker&#x27;s attacker, thus turning heel once again and reigniting their feud. He successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred match at Night of Champions on September 19. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, a casket was brought to ringside by druids to reveal the return of Paul Bearer, supporting The Undertaker. At Hell in a Cell on October 3, Bearer turned on The Undertaker and allied himself with Kane, who retained the World Heavyweight Championship in a Hell in a Cell match with Bearer&#x27;s help. At Bragging Rights on October 24, Kane defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after help from The Nexus to retain the World Heavyweight Championship once again, thus ending their feud.

Kane then rekindled his feud with Edge, who on the October 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; was named the new challenger to Kane&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series on November 21. On the November 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge kidnapped Bearer and started to play mind games with Kane, trying to psychologically wear him down before their title match. At Survivor Series, Kane retained his title after the referee determined the match a draw due to both men pinning each other at the same time. As Edge still had Bearer in his captivity, Kane agreed to a rematch at the pay-per-view on December 19. On the December 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Edge defeated Kane in a non-title match to win the right to determine the stipulation for the title match; Edge chose a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match before leaving Kane with a Paul Bearer lookalike and driving away with the genuine Bearer strapped to the back of a truck. The following week, Kane accidentally injured Bearer, believing it to be another hoax by Edge, and Bearer was written out of the storyline. The week after, Kane rampaged into the stadium to hunt down Edge hoping to get back at him but the two were nearly restrained by the entire Smackdown roster. At TLC, Kane lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Edge in a four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match also involving Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio. Kane received his rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship on the January 7, 2011 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; in a Last Man Standing match, but was unsuccessful.

Kane competed in the Royal Rumble match on January 30, the largest Royal Rumble match in history, and was the 40th and final person to enter the match, but was eliminated by Rey Mysterio. Kane then competed in the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Elimination Chamber on February 20, eliminating Drew McIntyre and Big Show before being eliminated by Edge. The following month, Kane reunited with the Big Show against a common enemy, The Corre, thus turning face once again in the process. Kane and Big Show began challenging them for the tag team titles and saving other wrestlers from their attacks. At WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, Big Show and Kane teamed with Santino Marella and Kofi Kingston to beat The Corre. The next week, a rematch took place under two out of three falls rules, which Kane&#x27;s team won. On the April 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the duo defeated Corre members Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater to win the WWE Tag Team Championship, their second championship as a team. Big Show and Kane then started feuding with the New Nexus. After defending the titles against CM Punk and Mason Ryan at Over the Limit on May 22, Kane and Big Show lost the championship to Michael McGillicutty and David Otunga the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;. The team disbanded after the match, as Big Show suffered an injury. Kane participated in the second annual SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at Money in the Bank on July 17, but the match was won by Daniel Bryan. On the July 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; after losing a street fight to Randy Orton, Kane was attacked by Mark Henry, who injured his leg with a steel chair. WWE reported the attack had fractured Kane&#x27;s fibula, likely to sideline him for five months.

==== Remasking (2011–2012) ====

Beginning in November, WWE began airing vignettes featuring Kane and a burning red mask and ending with the words &quot;Kane Resurrected&quot; appearing on screen. Kane returned on the December 12 episode of &quot;Raw SuperShow&quot; wearing a metallic mask and new ring attire inspired by the incisions of a postmortem human body after an autopsy. He interrupted the main event between Mark Henry and John Cena, attacking Cena before removing the metallic mask to reveal a new red mask and turning heel once again. Kane continued to attack Cena in the following weeks, claiming he wanted Cena to &quot;embrace the hate&quot; from Cena&#x27;s detractors, rather than try to &quot;Rise Above Hate&quot;, as Cena&#x27;s T-shirt proclaimed. Kane also attacked and injured Cena&#x27;s ally Zack Ryder. Kane and Cena fought to a double countout at the Royal Rumble on January 29, 2012. After the match, Kane attacked Ryder with a Tombstone Piledriver and then he chokeslammed Cena. On February 19 at Elimination Chamber, Cena defeated Kane in an Ambulance match to end the feud. In March, Kane initiated a feud with Randy Orton by attacking him. Kane later explained that he needed to feel like a monster again, and believed that defeating Orton would allow him to do that. Orton retaliated in the following weeks, leading to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII on April 1, which Kane won. In a rematch on the following &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Orton defeated Kane in a No Disqualification match. After Kane attacked Orton and his father, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton, the pair faced off at Extreme Rules on April 29, in a Falls Count Anywhere match, which Orton won by utilizing a steel chair.

On the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on July 23, Kane turned face once again when he was saved by his brother The Undertaker from an attack by Jinder Mahal, Drew McIntyre, Tyler Reks, Curt Hawkins, Hunico and Camacho. At SummerSlam on August 19, Kane was defeated by Bryan.
As a result of Bryan and Kane&#x27;s issues, AJ enrolled them in anger management classes hosted by Dr. Shelby and they were later forced to compete in a &quot;Hug it Out&quot; match. At the arrangement of Dr. Shelby and AJ, the two adversaries formed a team whose constant infighting during matches inadvertently resulted in them defeating The Prime Time Players (Titus O&#x27;Neil and Darren Young) to become the number one contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship, and defeating champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth to win the titles at Night of Champions on September 16. Kane and Bryan made their first successful title defense the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating the former champions in a rematch. The following week on &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;Team Hell No&quot; was chosen as the official team name via a Twitter poll. Team Hell No entered a feud with Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow), and successfully defended the championship against them on multiple occasions (including at Hell in a Cell on October 28 and the November 14 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot;).

Team Hell No lost their WWE Tag Team Championship rematch against Reigns and Rollins on the May 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

== Professional wrestling style, persona, and legacy ==

Upon his debut in the WWF, Jacobs portrayed a dental hygienist named Dr. Isaac Yankem; during this time he used a snap DDT as his finishing move. He later portrayed the Diesel character popularized by Kevin Nash following Nash&#x27;s departure to WCW in 1996; during this time he used a release powerbomb.

Upon his repackaging as Kane in 1997, Jacobs proceeded to utilize the chokeslam and the tombstone piledriver as finishers, taking after his older half-brother in storyline, The Undertaker. In 2001, Jacobs adopted a falling powerbomb as a finisher, reminiscent of The Undertaker&#x27;s &quot;Last Ride&quot;. He was nicknamed &quot;The Big Red Machine&quot;, &quot;The (Devil&#x27;s Favorite) Demon&quot;, and &quot;The (Big Red) Monster&quot; to emphasize his monstrous/demonic persona. His character wore a full mask before replacing it with a half mask in 2002. Kane appeared unmasked from 2003 until 2011 when he returned with a new half mask. Under his time in The Authority, Kane relinquished his mask and wore a suit and tie in a persona known as &quot;Corporate Kane&quot; where he also wrestled in dark slacks with elbow pads, though he later reverted to his attire and mask. In 2012, a WWE article ranked him as the 41st best wrestling villain in history.

In 2019 he altered his &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; nickname into &quot;Big Red Mayor&quot; when doing a Twitter AMA.

Veteran wrestler Ric Flair described Kane as &quot;the best in the world&quot;, while Big Show dubbed him &quot;the best big man ever&quot;.

== Political career ==

Jacobs is actively involved in libertarian politics and publishes his views via a blog. He supported Texas Congressman Ron Paul for president in 2008. He is a member of the Free State Project and delivered a speech at the organization&#x27;s 2009 New Hampshire Liberty Forum. He has also spoken at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an anarcho-capitalist think-tank for promoting the Austrian school of economics.

In an interview with &quot;The Tom Woods Show&quot; libertarian podcast, Jacobs mentioned Woods, Harry Browne, Ron Paul, John Stossel, Peter Schiff, and Murray Rothbard as his political influences and stated he is &quot;theoretically a Rothbardian&quot;, but does not believe that a stateless society would be achieved in his lifetime.

Some Tea Party affiliated groups attempted to recruit Jacobs to run in the 2014 Republican U.S. Senate primary in Tennessee against Sen. Lamar Alexander.

In an interview conducted with the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;, Jacobs mentioned he has thought about running for Governor of Tennessee once his current term as Knox County Mayor concludes.

Jacobs and Mark Calaway endorsed Trump in the 2024 United States presidential election, appearing in a TikTok with him which featured them calling out fellow wrestler Dave Bautista, who had been outspoken against Trump. Trump later went on to win the election.

=== Mayor of Knox County ===
In May 2016, Jacobs said he was &quot;seriously considering&quot; a run for the office of mayor of Knox County, Tennessee in 2018. In March 2017, he officially launched his campaign as a Republican. On May 1, 2018, he won the Republican primary election by 23 votes. On August 2, 2018, he was elected mayor, defeating Democratic opponent Linda Haney by a vote of 51,804 (66.39%) to 26,224 (33.61%).

In a 2019 interview with Fox News promoting a recently released book of his, Jacobs was critical of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, saying the Democratic Party was creating further division by pursuing it.

In July 2020, Jacobs was the only member of the Knox County Board of Health to vote against a mask mandate for those inside certain buildings. He defended his vote by saying, &quot;I worry that one-size-fits-all mandates such as this set a terrible precedent for government overreach, are difficult to enforce, can cause conflict between the authorities and the public when enforced, and, as written, this order places enforcement responsibilities on private businesses.&quot; He would get into a dispute with the Board in September 2020, after he recorded a video where images of fellow members were displayed over narration of Jacobs calling them &quot;unelected bureaucrats who cast down edicts which carry the force of law with no accountability and no recourse&quot;. He would advocate for the abolishment of the Board and later successfully pressured the Knox County Commission to move up a vote on limiting their powers from April to March 2021.

On August 5, 2022, Jacobs won a second term by defeating Democratic candidate Debbie Helsley in the 2022 Knox County mayoral election.

=== Electoral history ===








==Personal life==
Jacobs has been married to Crystal Maurisa Goins since August 23, 1995. They have two daughters, named Arista and Devan, as well as two grandchildren.

Outside of wrestling, Jacobs also works as an insurer and he and his wife own an Allstate agency in Knoxville, Tennessee. In a July 2015 interview for Realtor.com, the website of the National Association of Realtors, Jacobs indicated that the couple&#x27;s obligations to their insurance business led them to place their Jefferson City home up for sale. The home, built in 2005, was an hour&#x27;s drive from the agency and both Jacobs and his wife eventually grew tired of the commute.

Jacobs made his film debut as &quot;Jacob Goodnight&quot; in the first production of WWE Studios, &quot;See No Evil&quot;, which was released on May 19, 2006. Jacobs has also made an appearance in the film, &quot;MacGruber&quot;, alongside fellow WWE wrestlers Montel Vontavious Porter, Chris Jericho, The Great Khali, Mark Henry, and Big Show. &quot;See No Evil 2&quot;, also starring Jacobs, was announced in August 2013 and was released on October 21, 2014.

Kane appeared on a special WWE episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in March 2002, and won by beating out Bubba Ray Dudley in the final round. The money won was donated to Jacobs&#x27;s chosen charity, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, in Memphis, Tennessee. He also appeared on &quot;Smallville&quot; series episode &quot;Combat&quot; as Titan alongside former WWE Diva Ashley Massaro. The episode was aired on March 22, 2007. Kane was also featured in a Chef Boyardee commercial in which he attempts to eat while wearing his full face mask.

The Kane character was featured in the fourteen-issue &quot;Undertaker&quot; comic book produced by Chaos! Comics in 1999. The character only spoke once, in the &quot;Undertaker Halloween Special&quot;, which tied into the single issue &quot;Mankind&quot; comic book produced by the same company. A book written by Michael Chiappetta detailing the origins of Kane titled &quot;Journey into Darkness: An Unauthorized History of Kane&quot; was released in 2005. WWE released a three-disc anthology titled, &quot;The Twisted, Disturbed Life of Kane&quot; on December 9, 2008. The DVD consists of Kane&#x27;s greatest feuds and rivalries during his first ten years.

Jacobs hosted a podcast titled &quot;The Tiny Political Show&quot; under the pseudonym Citizen X from March 16, 2007, to March 13, 2008. Jacobs also ran a blog called &quot;The Adventures of Citizen X&quot; at AdventuresOfCitizenX.com from 2007 until July 17, 2011, though its last update was made on May 28 earlier that same year. The website since relaunched, with its first update appearing on July 1, 2012. Jacobs is a contributor to LewRockwell.com.

Kane has appeared in nearly every licensed WWE/F video game since 1998&#x27;s &quot;WWF War Zone&quot;, with the only exception being 2001&#x27;s &quot;WWF Betrayal&quot;. From the 1990s to the end of the 2010s, Kane had 222 action figures manufactured, mainly from the WWE lines by Jakks Pacific and Mattel, according to the Wrestling Figure Checklist.

<doc id="311938" wikidata="Q357482" url="?curid=311938" title="Rubbernecking">
<text>Rubbernecking is a derogatory term primarily used to refer to bystanders stopping previous activity to stare at accidents. More generally, it can refer to anyone staring at an object of everyday interest compulsively (especially tourists). The term &quot;rubbernecking&quot; derives from the neck&#x27;s appearance while trying to get a better view, that is, craning one&#x27;s neck.

Rubberneck is associated with morbid curiosity. It is often the cause of traffic jams, sometimes referred to as &quot;gapers&#x27; block&quot; or &quot;gapers&#x27; delay&quot;, as drivers slow down to see what happened in a crash. &quot;Rubberneck&quot; is considered as of 2007 unconventional English or slang.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;rubbernecking&quot; was coined in America in the 1890s to refer to tourists. H.L. Mencken said the word &quot;rubberneck&quot; is &quot;almost a complete treatise on American psychology&quot; and &quot;one of the best words ever coined&quot;.

By 1909, &quot;rubbernecking&quot; was used to describe the wagons, automobiles and buses used in tours around American cities, and through their Chinatowns. The tours included a megaphone-wielding individual offering commentary on the urban landscape. &quot;Chinese Rubbernecks&quot; was the title of a 1903 film.

One writer described the &quot;out-of-towners&quot; stretching their necks to see New York while having misinformation shouted at them, and artist John Sloan depicted them as geese in a 1917 etching called &quot;Seeing New York&quot;. Hawkers, touts and steerers were used to market the rubbernecking tours, also known as &quot;gape wagons&quot; or &quot;yap wagons.&quot;

When phone lines were shared as &quot;party lines&quot;, the term &quot;rubbernecking&quot; applied to someone who listened in on the conversation of others.

==Rubbernecking and the automobile==
The term is often used to refer to the activity of motorists slowing down in order to see something on the other side of a road or highway, often the scene of a traffic accident. This is sometimes also called &quot;accident gawking&quot;. A study on the English M6 motorway found that 29% of accidents and breakdowns caused slowdowns in the uninvolved opposite lanes. According to a 2003 study in the U.S., rubbernecking was the cause of 16% of distraction-related traffic accidents. Rubbernecking appears in the book &quot;100 Most Dangerous Things in Everyday Life and What You Can Do About Them&quot;, which advises that the safest course when there are flashing lights and an accident is to keep moving, as &quot;there is nothing to see here&quot;. Rubbernecking&#x27;s impact on traffic has been the subject of studies and is said to be factored into highway design.

===Prevention===
Incident screens have been designed that can be erected around vehicle accidents. The plastic partitions are designed to shield accidents from passing motorists in order to deter rubbernecking and improve the flow of traffic. Several types of screens have been trialed in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="311946" wikidata="Q7085491" url="?curid=311946" title="Old money">
<text>Old money is &quot;the inherited wealth of established upper-class families (i.e. gentry, patriciate)&quot; or &quot;a person, family, or lineage possessing inherited wealth&quot;. It is a social class of the rich who have been able to maintain their wealth over multiple generations, often referring to perceived members of the &quot;de facto&quot; aristocracy in societies that historically lack an officially established aristocratic class (such as the United States), in contrast with new money whose wealth has been acquired within its own generation.

==Wealth and class==
&quot;Wealth&quot;—assets held by an individual or by a household—provides an important dimension of social stratification because it can pass from generation to generation, ensuring that a family&#x27;s offspring will remain financially stable. Families with &quot;old money&quot; use accumulated assets or savings to bridge interruptions in income, thus guarding against downward social mobility.

&quot;Old money&quot; applies to those of the upper class whose wealth separates them from lower social classes.

==United States==
According to anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner, the upper class in the United States during the 1930s was divided into the upper-upper and the lower-upper classes. The lower-upper were those who did not come from traditionally wealthy families. They earned their money from investments and business, rather than inheritance. Examples include John D. Rockefeller, whose father was a traveling peddler; Cornelius Vanderbilt, whose father operated a ferry in New York Harbor; Henry Flagler, who was the son of a Presbyterian minister; and Andrew Carnegie, who was the son of a Scottish weaver. In contrast to the &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, whose riches were acquired in their own generation, the upper-upper class were families viewed as &quot;quasi-aristocratic&quot; and &quot;high society&quot;. These families had been rich and prominent in the politics of the United States for generations. In many cases, their prominence predated the American Revolution (1765–1783), when their ancestors had accumulated fortunes as members of the elite planter class, or as merchants, slave traders, ship-owners, or fur traders. In many cases, especially in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas, the source of these families&#x27; wealth were vast tracts of land granted to their ancestors by the Crown or acquired by headright during the colonial period. These planter class families were often related to each other through intermarriage for more than 300 years, and are sometimes known as American gentry. They produced several Founding Fathers of the United States and a number of early presidents of the United States.

After the American Civil War (1861–1865), many in the upper-upper class saw their wealth greatly reduced. Their slaves became freedmen. Union forces under Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan had also cut wide swaths of destruction through portions of Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia. They destroyed crops, killed or confiscated livestock, burned barns and gristmills, and in some cases torched plantation houses and even entire cities such as Atlanta. They were using scorched earth tactics, designed to starve the Confederate States of America into submission. After the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1865) and the emancipation of the slaves, many plantations were converted to sharecropping. African American freedmen were working as sharecroppers on the same land which they had worked as slaves before the war. Despite the fact that their circumstances were greatly reduced, the enactment of Jim Crow laws and the disenfranchisement of freed black people allowed many planter class families in the Southern United States to regain their political prominence, if not their great wealth, following Reconstruction (1863–1877).

In the early 20th century, the upper-upper class were seen as more prestigious than the nouveau riche even if the nouveau riche had more wealth. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the nouveau rich flaunted their wealth by building Gilded Age mansions that emulated the palaces of European royalty, while old money was more conservative. American &quot;Old money&quot; families tend to adhere to various Mainline Protestant denominations; Episcopalians and Presbyterians are the most prevalent among them.

===Early Colonial===
* The Byrd Family of Virginia, FFV, is descended from William Byrd I who received a grant on 27 October 1673 at the fall line of the James River that would later become the site of Richmond, Virginia. Byrd&#x27;s son William Byrd II of Westover Plantation who inherited the land was an American planter and author from Charles City County in colonial Virginia. He expanded his holdings to approximately and founded the City of Richmond. Although much of the family&#x27;s wealth was squandered during the 18th century by William Byrd III through gambling and bad investments, descendant Richard Evelyn Byrd Sr. became wealthy as an apple grower in the Shenandoah Valley and publisher of the Winchester Star newspaper. He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1906 and served as Speaker from 1908 to 1914. His son Harry Flood Byrd was elected the 50th Governor of Virginia in 1925, and later served in the US Senate until his retirement in 1965. Byrd controlled a Democratic political machine known as the Byrd Organization that dominated Virginia politics for most of the 20th century. Byrd was succeeded in the US Senate by his son Harry F. Byrd Jr. who served until 1981. The family also produced early Ohio political leader and jurist, Charles Willing Byrd, and polar explorer, Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. 
* The Cabot family arrived in Salem from the Isle of Jersey in 1700 and made fortunes in shipping. George Cabot was an American merchant, seaman, and politician from Massachusetts.

* The Carter family of Corotoman, Shirley, Sabine Hall, Nomony Hall, Cleve and Carter&#x27;s Grove, FFV, of Virginia is descended from Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter, of Lancaster County, who was a planter, businessman and colonist in Virginia and became one of the wealthiest men in the colonies accumulating over 300,000 acres of land and more than 1,000 slaves. As President of the Governor&#x27;s Council of the Virginia Colony, he was acting Governor of Virginia from 1726 to 1727 after the death in office of Governor Hugh Drysdale. He acquired the moniker &quot;King&quot; due to his great wealth, political power, and autocratic business methods. His many notable descendants include: Robert Burwell, a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, Robert Carter III, who sat on the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council, Carter Braxton, a signer of Declaration of Independence, Mann Page a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777, Confederate States Army General Robert E. Lee, Confederate Army first lieutenant Robert Randolph Carter, John Page, the 13th Governor of Virginia, Thomas Nelson Page, who served as US ambassador to Italy during the Woodrow Wilson administration, and civil engineer and industrialist William Nelson Page.

* The Corbin Family, FFV, of Middlesex County, Virginia, beginning with Henry Corbin was an emigrant from England who became a tobacco planter in the Virginia colony and served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, in the House of Burgesses representing Lancaster County before the creation of Middlesex County on Virginia&#x27;s Middle Neck, then on the Governor&#x27;s Council. The governor and council made Corbin a justice of the Lancaster County court in 1657. Lancaster County voters in both 1659 and 1660 elected Corbin as one of their representatives in the House of Burgesses, alongside the county&#x27;s largest plantation owner, John Carter, Sr.. His son Gawin Corbin (burgess) was prominent in political affairs. His daughter Laetitia Corbin Lee married Richard Lee II of Machodoc Plantation, while another daughter Ann married William Tayloe (the nephew). Gawin Corbin Sr., son of the Burgess was a Virginia planter and politician who served in the House of Burgesses representing Middlesex County, Virginia. Richard Corbin was a Virginia planter and politician who represented Middlesex County in the House of Burgesses and the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council. Although a noted Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War (during which two brothers served in British forces), he considered himself a Virginian and two of his descendants of the same name also served in the Virginia General Assembly following the conflict. Hannah Lee Corbin was an American women&#x27;s rights advocate and member of the Lee family in Virginia. A controversial widow in her own time in part for her refusal to marry her paramour (with whom she had children) or conversion from the Church of England to the Baptists, she may today be best known for asking that women be given the right to vote. John Tayloe Corbin was a Virginia planter and politician who represented King and Queen County in the House of Burgesses. The son of the powerful planter Richard Corbin, a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council, he was likewise a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War (during which two brothers served in British forces), but remained in Virginia.

* The Custis Family FFV dates back to the mid-seventeenth century, four members of the Custis family immigrated to the colony of Virginia: Anne, John Custis II, William II, and their uncle John I. John II was the most successful at establishing the family name into prominent society, advancing into the Virginia ruling class by serving as a sheriff, justice of the peace, surveyor, coroner, militia officer, member of the House of Burgess, and Councillor. John II also built a large mansion that he called Arlington. His descendants included his son John Custis III and grandson John IV, who was born in August 1678. John Custis IV was the father of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Dandridge Custis&#x27;s first husband, Martha&#x27;s Second husband was George Washington. Making his step grandchildren and wife USA First Inaugural Family
* The Delano family of Massachusetts and New York is descended from Philippe de Lannoy, who was born in 1602 to parents of French and Dutch descent. In the United States, members of the Delano family include U.S. presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Ulysses S. Grant and Calvin Coolidge, astronaut Alan B. Shepard, and writer Laura Ingalls Wilder. Delano family forebears include the Pilgrims who chartered the Mayflower, seven of its passengers, and three signers of the Mayflower Compact.
* The Griswold Family of Connecticut made their fortune in shipping, banking, railroads, and industry. They have been prominent in American politics, producing five governors and numerous senators and congressmen.
* The Harrisons of Berkley, FFV, of Virginia is an American political family, of the Commonwealth of Virginia, whose direct descendants include a Founding Father of the United States, Benjamin Harrison V, and three U. S. presidents: William Henry Harrison, Benjamin Harrison, and Abraham Lincoln. The Virginia Harrison family consists primarily of two branches with origins in northern England. One branch, led by Benjamin Harrison I, journeyed by way of Bermuda to Virginia before 1633 and settled along the James River where they became wealthy planters; they are often referred to as the James River Harrisons. Successive generations of this branch served in the legislature of the Colony of Virginia, including Benjamin V, who was a signatory of the Declaration of Independence and later governor of Virginia. This branch of the Harrison family produced President William Henry Harrison, Benjamin V&#x27;s son, and President Benjamin Harrison, William Henry&#x27;s grandson, as well as another Virginia governor, Albertis Harrison. The family also includes two Chicago mayors and members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The other branch of the Virginia Harrisons emigrated from Britain to New England in 1687 and moved south to the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia 50 years later; they were led by Isaiah Harrison. This branch most likely descended from an interim chaplain of the Jamestown Colony, Rev. Thomas Harrison, who was kindred to the James River Harrisons, but by 1650 had returned to England. President Abraham Lincoln descended from the Shenandoah Valley Harrisons, as did entertainer Elvis Presley. This branch of the family also included the founders of Harrisonburg and Dayton and physician J. Hartwell Harrison, who was part of the medical team that accomplished the world&#x27;s first successful kidney transplant surgery.

He arrived in Virginia sometime between 1669 and 1673 and married Mary Isham a few years later. Randolph&#x27;s descendants have included many prominent Americans, including U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall, Confederate General, Robert E. Lee, Peyton Randolph, the first President of the Continental Congress, and Edmund Randolph, who served as the seventh Governor of Virginia, the second US Secretary of State, and the first U.S. Attorney General as well as many other notable individuals in Virginia and U.S. politics.
* The Roosevelt family of Manhattan arrived from the Netherlands as colonists in the 17th century and later became prominent in business and politics. Two distantly related branches of the family, from Oyster Bay on Long Island and Hyde Park in Dutchess County, rose to global political prominence with the elections of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) and his fifth cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945), whose wife, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, was Theodore&#x27;s niece. 
* The Tayloes, of Mount Airy, The Octagon House, Powhattan Hill, Buena Vista, the Tayloe House in Colonial Williamsburg, and later the Alabama, Canebrake, FFV, descended from William Tayloe (planter) who first held elected office in 1647 as High Sheriff of York County, Virginia. He married Elizabeth Kingsmill, daughter of Virginia Company proprietor Richard Kingsmill. William Tayloe (the nephew) built the Old House in Old Rappahannock County and married Ann Corbin (1664–1694), daughter of Hon. Henry Corbin and Alice (Eltonhead) Corbin, of &quot;Buckingham House&quot; Middlesex County, John Tayloe II built Mount Airy, imported Diomed, and after the death of King Carter took over the moniker of Wealthiest Man/Family in Virginia. John Tayloe III lent his home in Washington, DC, The Octagon House, to President James Madison and wife Dolly Madison after the British burnt the White House during The War of 1812. He founded St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square and the Washington Jockey Club with Charles Carnan Ridgely of Hampton, and bred Sir Archie. His sons, all scions of the tidewater gentry, their mother the daughter of Benjamin Ogle of Belair and Ogle Hall, descended from the Baron Ogle of Northumberland, allied through marriage with the Manners of Rutland, Cavendish family of Newcastle, the premiere peerage, the Baron de Ros and ancient Norman House of Percy. John Tayloe IV served as a midshipman on the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe was a member of the Porcellian Club and then a prominent political activist in Washington, D.C., having begun his career as Richard Rush&#x27;s personal secretary during his time as Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and built the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House on Lafayette Square. Edward Thornton Tayloe was a member of the Porcellian Club, served as a diplomat having begun his career as Joel Roberts Poinsett&#x27;s personal secretary, and was rumored to be William Henry Harrison&#x27;s pick for Secretary of the Treasury before this untimely death, and Henry Augustine Tayloe co-founded the Fair Grounds Race Course with French Creole Bernard de Marigny. While the foundation of their wealth was agricultural slave plantations, they exemplified gentry entrepreneurship by diversifying and vertically integrating; first shipbuilding to move the agricultural produce, then producing iron, smelting, at their furnaces Bristol Iron Works and Neabsco Iron Works and mining their coal fields in Namejoy, Maryland, namely Tayloe&#x27;s Neck, to build ships.
* The Van Rensselaer family of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, is a family of Dutch descent that was prominent during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in the area now known as the state of New York. Members of this family played a critical role in the formation of the United States and served as leaders in business, politics, and society. Beginning with Kiliaen van Rensselaer (merchant) was a Dutch diamond and pearl merchant from Amsterdam who was one of the founders and directors of the Dutch West India Company, being instrumental in the establishment of New Netherland. He was granted the Manor of Rensselaerswyck in what is now mainly New York&#x27;s Capital District. His estate remained throughout the Dutch and British colonial era and the American Revolution as a legal entity until the 1840s. Johan van Rensselaer was the second patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, was the eldest son of Kiliaen van Rensselaer, and his first wife, Hillegonda van Bylaer.
* The Van Everinghe van Watervliet family (eventually simplified and Anglicized to Van Every and Van Avery) were Dutch barons who first amassed a fortune as brewers, land owners, and high governmental officials in the old country in the mid-16th Century. Migrating to North America in the mid-17th Century they continued to become prominent smiths, fur traders, and land owners from the founding of Beverwijck, present day Albany, New York, through the American Revolution. The city of Watervliet, New York, is likely named after the family&#x27;s original &quot;ridderhofstede&quot; (knightly estate) in the County of Zeeland. The first members were granted a warrant as sole suppliers of arms and armor to Fort Orange, were active in the Albany Convention during Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion, and were close associates of the Van Rensselaers. Later, one member took the Oath of Secrecy as a Son of Liberty, served as Chairman of the Schenectady Committee of Correspondence and as a Senator in the newly-formed New York Assembly. Several served as officers in the militia during the Revolution, including in Van Rensselaer&#x27;s Regiment, and one served alongside George Washington from 1775-1780, including the bitter winter at Valley Forge and the Crossing of the Delaware. Later generations include industrialists, hoteliers, inventors, professional athletes, and writers, and share bloodlines with George Washington, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Philip Schuyler.

===Late Colonial===
* The Astor family made their fortune in the 18th century, through fur trading, real estate, the hotel industry, and other investments.
* The Forbes family of Boston made their fortune in the shipping and later railroad industries as well as other investments. They have been a prominent wealthy family in the United States for 200 years.
*The Hartwick family is of mainly English and German descent, and their ancestry and fortune predates the American Revolution. The Hartwicks have produced several politicians and military generals, such as Edward Hartwick. By World War I, the family-controlled most of the lumber in the United States. The Hartwick&#x27;s philanthropic works include the founding of Hartwick College, and Hartwick Pines State Park.

===Early National Era===
* The Du Pont family fortune began in 1803, but they became an extraordinarily wealthy family by selling gunpowder during the American Civil War. By World War I, the DuPont family produced virtually all American gunpowder. In 1968, Ferdinand Lundberg declared the Du Pont fortune to be America&#x27;s largest family fortune. {{As of | 2008}} E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company ranked 81st on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations.
* The Mellon family made their fortune in the banking business. The Mellon Bank was founded in 1869 by Thomas Mellon. Under the direction of his son, Andrew Mellon the family amassed one of the Gilded Age&#x27;s largest fortunes. They became principal investors and majority owners of Gulf Oil (which merged with Chevron Corporation in 1985), Alcoa (since 1886), &quot;The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; (since 1970), Koppers (since 1912), and New York Shipbuilding (1899–1968), as well as other major firms. The family bank merged with the Bank of New York and continues today as BNY Mellon.

* The Van Leer family of Pennsylvania made their fortune in the iron business. They have been prominent in academia, business, and American politics. Descendants include successful entrepreneurs, governors, congressmen, university presidents, and university founders.
* The Whitney family is an American family notable for their business enterprises, social prominence, wealth and philanthropy, founded by John Whitney, who came from London, England to Watertown, Massachusetts in 1635. The Whitney family are members of the Episcopal Church.

Although many &quot;old money&quot; individuals do not rank as high on the list of Forbes 400 richest Americans as their ancestors did, their wealth continues to grow. Many families increased their holdings by investment strategies such as the pooling of resources.{{rp|115}} For example, the Rockefeller family&#x27;s estimated net worth of $1 billion in the 1930s grew to $8.5 billion by 2000—that is, not adjusted for inflation. In 60 years, four of the richest families in the United States increased their combined $2–4 billion in 1937 to $38 billion without holding large shares in emerging industries. When adjusted for inflation, the actual dollar wealth of many of these families has shrunk since the &#x27;30s.{{rp|115}}{{rp|2}}

From a private wealth manager&#x27;s perspective, &quot;old money&quot; can be classified into two: active &quot;old money&quot; and passive &quot;old money&quot;. The former includes inheritors who, despite the inherited wealth at their disposal or that which they can access in the future, choose to pursue their own career or set up their own businesses. Paris Hilton and Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou did this. On the other hand, passive &quot;old money&quot; are the idle rich or those who are not wealth producers.

&quot;Old money&quot; contrasts with the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; and &quot;parvenus&quot;. These fall under the category &quot;new money&quot; (those not from traditionally wealthy families).

== Europe ==
The Rothschild family, as an example, established finance houses across Europe from the 18th century and was ennobled by the Habsburg emperor and Queen Victoria. Throughout the 19th century, they controlled the largest fortune in the world, in today&#x27;s terms many hundreds of billions. The family has, at least to some extent, maintained its wealth for over two centuries. 

On the other hand, in Britain, the term generally exclusively refers to the nobility – that is, the peerage and landed gentry – who traditionally live off the land inherited paternally. The British concept is analogous to good lineage and it is not uncommon to find someone with &quot;old money&quot; who is actually poor or insolvent. By 2001, however, those belonging to this category—the aristocratic landowners—are still part of the wealthiest list in the United Kingdom. For instance, the Duke of Westminster, by way of his Grosvenor estate, owns large swaths of properties in London that include 200 acres of Belgravia and 100 acres of Mayfair. There is also the case of Viscount Portman, who is the owner of 100 acres of land north of Oxford Street.

Many countries had wealth-based restrictions on voting. In France, out of a nation of 27 million people, only 80,000 to 90,000 were allowed to vote in the 1820 French legislative election and the richest one-quarter of them had two votes.

<text>Reunion Island ornate day gecko or Manapany day gecko (Phelsuma inexpectata) is a critically endangered diurnal species of gecko. It occurs only on the island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean, typically inhabits trees, and feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard is one of the smallest day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 12 cm at most. The body colour is dark green. Three red stripes extend from the snout to the neck. From behind the eye, a thick brown stripe and a thin green-white extend to above the front leg. The snout is partly dark blue. The back is covered with reddish-coloured dots, which are greatly reduced in females. The ventral side is off-white.

== Distribution and habitat ==

This species is endemic to Réunion. It is found in the coastal areas in the region of Manapany-Les-Bains and St.-Joseph. This coastal ecosystem is among the most threatened on the island, and the gecko&#x27;s habitat is severely fragmented by urbanization and agriculture. 

It typically lives on trees such as papaya, banana, pandanus and other pantropic vegetation. The geckos also inhabit human dwellings and have been spotted on postboxes and fences. This biotope is relatively dry and hot.

== Behaviour ==

=== Feeding ===
They feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

=== Breeding ===
At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 50–52 days. The juveniles measure around 48 mm.

== Status and conservation ==
The species is critically endangered, with a population of 3-5 thousand in 2011. The population is shrinking rapidly: in 1995, it was estimated at 5-10 thousand. It is listed in CITES Appendix II.

=== Captivity ===
The geckos can be quite shy in captivity and are also surprisingly speedy. There is no information on the effect of the pet trade on the population. They are captive-bred by some dealers.
