<text>was a Japanese &quot;samurai&quot;, a &quot;shishi&quot; and influential figure of the &quot;Bakumatsu,&quot; and establishment of the Empire of Japan in the late Edo period.

Sakamoto was a low-ranking &quot;samurai&quot; from the Tosa Domain on Shikoku and became an active opponent of the Tokugawa Shogunate after the end of Japan&#x27;s &quot;sakoku&quot; isolationist policy. Under the alias , he worked against the Bakufu, the government of the Tokugawa shogunate, and was often hunted by their supporters and the &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;. Sakamoto advocated for democracy, Japanese nationalism, return of power to the Imperial Court, abolition of feudalism, and moderate modernization and industrialization of Japan. Sakamoto successfully negotiated the Satchō Alliance between the powerful rival Chōshū and Satsuma domains and united them against the Bakufu. Sakamoto was assassinated in December 1867 with his companion Nakaoka Shintarō, shortly before the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration.

== Early life ==
Sakamoto Ryōma was born on 3 January 1836 in Kōchi in the han (domain) of Tosa, located in Tosa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture) on the island of Shikoku. By the Japanese calendar, Sakamoto was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, of the sixth year of &quot;Tenpō&quot;. The Sakamoto family held the rank of country &quot;samurai&quot; or &quot;&quot;, the lowest rank in the &quot;samurai&quot; hierarchy, which previous generations had purchased by acquiring enough wealth as &quot;sake&quot; brewers. Unlike other Japanese domains, Tosa had a strictly-enforced separation between the &quot;joshi&quot; (high-ranking samurai) and &quot;kashi&quot; (low-ranking samurai). The ranks were treated unequally and residential areas were segregated; even in Sakamoto Ryōma&#x27;s generation (the third in the Sakamoto family), his family&#x27;s samurai rank remained &quot;kashi&quot;. 

At the age of twelve, Sakamoto was enrolled in a private school, but this was a brief episode in his life as he showed little scholarly inclination. Ryōma&#x27;s older sister subsequently enrolled him in fencing classes of the Oguri-ryū when he was 14 after he was bullied at school. By the time Sakamoto reached adulthood, he was by all accounts a master swordsman. In 1853, Sakamoto was allowed by his clan to travel to Edo, the seat of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate and the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Japan, to train and polish his skills as a swordsman. Sakamoto enrolled as a student at the famous Hokushin Ittō-ryū Hyōhō Chiba-Dōjō, which was led by its first Headmaster Chiba Sadakichi Masamichi at that time. Sakamoto received the scroll from the school that declared his mastery. Sakamoto became a &quot;shihan&quot; at the Chiba-Dōjō and taught Kenjutsu to the students together with Chiba Jūtarō Kazutane, in whom he found a close friend.

==Politics==

===Early &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;===

In 1853, the Perry Expedition began while Sakamoto was studying and teaching in Edo, beginning the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period. Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the United States arrived in Japan with a fleet of ships to forcibly end the centuries-old &quot;sakoku&quot; policy of national isolationism. In March 1854, Perry pressured the Tokugawa to sign the Convention of Kanagawa, officially ending the &quot;sakoku&quot; policy but widely perceived in Japan as an &quot;unequal treaty&quot; and a sign of weakness. The prestige and legitimacy of the &quot;Shōgun&quot;, a &quot;de facto&quot; military ruler with a nominal appointment from the Emperor of Japan, was severely damaged to the public. The convention was signed by the &quot;rōjū&quot; Abe Masahiro, acting as regent for the young and sickly &quot;Shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iesada, against the will of the Imperial Court in Kyoto, the &quot;de jure&quot; ruling authority. Anti-Tokugawa considered this evidence that the &quot;Shōgun&quot; could no longer fulfil the Emperor&#x27;s will, and therefore no longer fit to rule for him. Sakamoto and many of the &quot;samurai&quot; class supported returning state power directly to the Imperial Court in Kyoto and began agitating for the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate.

In 1858, Sakamoto returned to Tosa after completing his studies, and became politically active in the local &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot;, the anti-Tokugawa movement arose in the aftermath of the Convention of Kanagawa.

In 1862, Sakamoto&#x27;s friend Takechi Hanpeita (or Takechi Zuizan) organized the Tosa Loyalist Party &quot;Kinnoto&quot;, a &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; organization of about 2000 samurai (mostly from the lower rank) with the political slogan &quot;Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians&quot; that insisted on the reform of the Tosa government. Yamauchi Toyoshige, the &quot;daimyō&quot; (lord) of the Tosa Domain, refused to recognize the group. In response, Tosa Kinnoto plotted to assassinate Yamauchi&#x27;s governor, Yoshida Toyo, who was appointed as a reformer and modernizer. Yoshida was later assassinated by Tosa Kinnoto after Sakamoto had left Tosa. Sakamoto participated in the plot but did not advocate: he believed Tosa Kinnoto should do something for all of Japan, while Takechi demanded a revolution for only the Tosa clan. Sakamoto decided to separate from Takechi and leave Tosa without authorization. In those days, no one in Japan was permitted to leave their clan without permission under the penalty of death, known as &quot;dappan&quot;. One of Sakamoto&#x27;s sisters committed suicide because she left without permission. Sakamoto later used the alias &quot;Saitani Umetarō&quot; (才谷 梅太郎) as he worked against the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Sakamoto is mentioned under this alias in the diary of Ernest Satow for 30 September 1867: &quot;Mr. Saedani had to be sat up for laughing at the questions put by us, evidently with the object of ridiculing us out of our case, but he got a flea in his lug and shut up making the most diabolical faces.&quot;

===Late &quot;Bakumatsu&quot;===
While a &quot;rōnin&quot;, Sakamoto decided to assassinate Katsu Kaishū, a high-ranking official in the Tokugawa shogunate and a supporter of both modernization and westernization. However, Katsu Kaishū persuaded Sakamoto of the necessity of a long-term plan to increase Japan&#x27;s military strength in the face of Western influence which led to the Convention of Kanagawa. Instead of killing Katsu Kaishū, Sakamoto started working as his assistant and protégé.

In 1864, as the Tokugawa shogunate began taking a hard line against dissenters, Sakamoto fled to Kagoshima in Satsuma Domain, which was developing as a major centre for the anti-Tokugawa movement. In 1866, Sakamoto took part in the negotiation process of the secret Satchō Alliance between the Satsuma and Chōshū – two powerful domains that historically had been irreconcilable enemies. Sakamoto&#x27;s position as a &quot;neutral outsider&quot; was critical in bridging the gap in trust and ending the feud, and accomplished the establishment of a significant military alliance against the Tokugawa. Sakamoto founded the private navy and trading company Kameyama Shachū in Nagasaki City with the help of the Satsuma, which later became &quot;kaientai&quot; or Ocean Support Fleet.

Chōshū&#x27;s subsequent victory over the Tokugawa army in 1866 and the impending collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate made Sakamoto a valuable commodity to his former masters in Tosa, and recalled to Kōchi with honours. The Tosa Domain was anxious to obtain a negotiated settlement between the &quot;Shōgun&quot; and the Emperor, which would prevent the powerful Satchō Alliance from overthrowing the Tokugawa by force and thus emerging as a new dominant force in ruling Japan. Sakamoto again played a crucial role in the subsequent negotiations that led to the voluntary resignation of the Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu in 1867, thus bringing about the Meiji Restoration.

=== First assassination attempt ===
In March of 1866, several agents of the shogunate attempted to assassinate Sakamoto Ryōma by ambushing him at the Teradaya ryokan in Kyoto. Two aspects of this have become famous. Firstly, he was alerted just in time by his future wife Narasaki Ryō (Oryō), who was surprised in her bath by the attackers and ran across a garden and up to the second floor of the inn to warn Sakamoto. Secondly, he used a Western firearm, a Smith and Wesson revolver, to fight off these attackers.

== Assassination ==

Sakamoto was assassinated at the Ōmiya Inn (Omiya) in Kyoto on 10 December 1867, not long before the Meiji Restoration took place, at the age of 31. At night, assassins gathered at the door of the inn, one approached and knocked, acting as an ordinary caller. The door was answered by Sakamoto&#x27;s bodyguard and manservant Yamada Tōkichi (山田藤吉), a former sumo wrestler, who told the stranger he would see if Sakamoto was accepting callers at that hour of the evening. When the bodyguard turned his back, the visitor at the door drew his sword and fatally slashed his back. The team of assassins then rushed in past the dying bodyguard and up the stairs to the guests&#x27; rooms. Sakamoto and his associate Nakaoka Shintarō were resting and talking in one room. Hearing the scuffle on the first floor, Sakamoto opened the door to yell at his bodyguard, thinking he was wrestling with a friend. The assassins charged the room, some tearing through the paper doors, and a confused melée ensued as lamps were knocked over and the room went dark. By the end of the fight, both Sakamoto and Shintaro lay badly wounded, and the assassins fled. Sakamoto died that night, regretting with his last words that his assassins caught him unprepared. Shintaro succumbed to injuries two days later, never regaining enough consciousness to identify the assassins, but mentioned hearing Iyo dialect among the killers.

The night of the assassination was eventually called the (近江屋事件). According to the traditional lunar calendar, Sakamoto was born on the 15th day of the 11th month, and killed on his birthday in 1867. Initial reports of Sakamoto&#x27;s and Shintarō&#x27;s deaths accused members of the &quot;Shinsengumi&quot;, a special police force of swordsmen from the Bakufu (Tokugawa military government) based in Kyoto. Shinsengumi leader Kondō Isami was later executed on this charge. However, members of another pro-&quot;shōgun&quot; group, the &quot;Mimawarigumi&quot;, confessed to the murder in 1870. Although &quot;Mimawarigumi&quot; members Sasaki Tadasaburō (佐々木 只三郎) and carry the blame, the identity of the true assassin has never been proven. Okuda Matsugoro, who was known for working since his early adolescence as a spy for Kondō, was rumoured to have taken part in the assassination.

== Legacy ==

Sakamoto was a visionary who dreamt of an independent Japan without feudalism or the caste system, inspired by the example of the United States where &quot;all men are created equal&quot;. Sakamoto was an admirer of democratic principles and studied democratic governance, particularly the United States Congress and British Parliament, as a model for the governance of Japan after the Restoration. Sakamoto argued that after centuries of having little-to-no political power, the Imperial Court lacked the resources and wherewithal to run the country. Sakamoto wrote the &quot;Eight Proposals While Shipboard&quot; (『船中八策』) while discussing the future model of the Japanese government with Gotō Shōjirō on board a Tosa ship outside Nagasaki in 1867. Sakamoto outlined the need for a democratically elected bicameral legislature, the writing of a constitution, the formation of a national army and navy, and the regulation of the exchange rates of gold and silver. Sakamoto read about the Western world and realized that for Japan to compete with an industrially and technologically advanced outside world, the Japanese people needed to modernize. Sakamoto&#x27;s proposals are thought to form the basis for the subsequent parliamentary system implemented in Japan after his death.

Sakamoto has also been seen as an intriguing mix of the traditional and modern, symbolized by his preference for samurai dress while favouring Western footwear.

Sakamoto has been heavily featured and romanticized in Japanese popular culture.

=== Honours in modern times ===
On 15 November 2003, the Kōchi Airport was renamed the Kōchi Ryōma Airport in his honour.

There is a Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum (坂本龍馬記念館) south of Kōchi, with a large bronze statue of Sakamoto overlooking the sea. The city of Kōchi has a number of Sakamoto-themed attractions and locations, including the Sakamoto Ryōma Birthplace Memorial, and the Sakamoto Ryōma Hometown Museum, dedicated to showing what downtown Kōchi was like during his childhood, including relevant aspects that may have influenced his views. On 15 November 2009, the Hokkaidō Sakamoto Ryōma Memorial Museum was built in Hakodate, Hokkaido.

Asteroid 2835 Ryoma is named after him. Asteroid 5823 Oryo is named after his wife.

== In popular culture ==

=== Dramas, film and manga ===
An April 2010 &quot;Japan Times&quot; article stated &quot;Ryōma has inspired at least seven television drama series, six novels, seven manga and five films.&quot; Actor Masaharu Fukuyama said that Ryoma&#x27;s appeal stems from being &quot;the kind of person onto whom anyone can project themselves&quot;, when describing his role as Ryoma in the NHK Taiga drama &quot;Ryōmaden&quot;.

Sakamoto Ryōma is a prominent character in the 2009–2011 TV series &quot;Jin&quot;, portrayed by actor Masaaki Uchino.

In the thirteenth episode of the anime series &quot;Arakawa Under the Bridge&quot; (2010), the character known as Last Samurai performs an impression of Ryōma. During his impression, he exclaims &quot;my shoulder huuuuurts,&quot; to which the main character, Recruit, responds &quot;that was an everyday Ryōma!&quot;

Sakamoto Ryōma appears as the main protagonist of &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot;, a spin-off of the &quot;Like a Dragon&quot; game series. He has the visual likeness and voice of Kazuma Kiryu.

He appears as a major supporting character in &quot;Rise of the Rōnin&quot; and as a secondary character in &quot;Inazuma Eleven&quot; Go Chrono Stones.

In the 2018 NHK Taiga drama &quot;Segodon&quot;, Ryoma is portrayed by Shun Oguri.

He is also the inspiration and basis for the character of Sakamoto Tatsuma in the &quot;manga&quot; and &quot;anime&quot; series &quot;Gintama&quot; created by &quot; Hideaki Sorachi&quot;.

Sakamoto Ryōma is a character in the &quot;Shura no toki&quot; manga.

=== Games ===
Sakamoto Ryōma is a playable character in the &quot;Infiltrator&quot; chapter of &quot;Live A Live&quot; (1994). He is held as a political prisoner by the warlord Ode Iou, but is later freed by the shinobi Oboromaru and joins him in stopping Ode&#x27;s plans. He also appears as a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, with additional appearances in other &quot;Fate&quot; media, like the manga &quot;Fate/KOHA-ACE&quot; and its revised adaptation, &quot;Fate/type Redline&quot;. Sakamoto is also a playable character in &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot; and &quot;Rise of the Rōnin&quot;.

<doc id="317058" wikidata="Q549737" url="?curid=317058" title="Sasaki Kojirō">
<text>was a Japanese swordsman who may have lived during the Azuchi–Momoyama and early Edo periods and is known primarily for the story of his duel with Miyamoto Musashi in 1612, where Sasaki was killed. Although suffering from defeat as well as death at the hands of Musashi, he is a revered and respected warrior in Japanese history and culture. Later Miyamoto proclaimed that Sasaki Kojirō was the strongest opponent he faced in his life.

==In popular culture==
Like most of the well-known samurai of his era, Sasaki was depicted in several places:

*He plays a central role in the novel, Musashi, by Eiji Yoshikawa. His life is described in a parallel storyline.
*In various film adaptations of his story or that of Miyamoto Musashi. For example, in &quot;Zoku Miyamoto Musashi: Ichijōji no kettō&quot; (&quot;Samurai 2: Duel at Ichijoji Temple&quot;; 1955; Director / Screenplay: Hiroshi Inagaki).
*In the manga &quot;Vagabond&quot;, he plays a central role alongside Musashi and is shown here as deaf.
*Tachibana Ukyo from the computer game &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; is modelled after Sasaki, just like the character Haōmaru is modelled after Miyamoto Musashi. His signature technique is also called Tsubame Gaeshi.
*In the visual novel and anime &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, Sasaki also played the role of a minor character.
*In the video game &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;, the archrival of the protagonist (Musashi) was named after him.
*In the &quot;Pokémon series&quot;, the original Japanese name for the Flying-type move Aerial Ace is &quot;Tsubame Gaeshi&quot;. Additionally, the anime characters Jessie and James are known in Japan as Musashi and Kojirō, respectively.
*In the anime and manga &quot;Record of Ragnarok&quot;, Sasaki is one of the thirteen fighters chosen to represent humanity in the Ragnarok tournament. Known as &quot;History&#x27;s Greatest Loser&quot;, he faces against the Greek god Poseidon and beats him in the third round of the tournament.
*An ōdachi named the &quot;Washing Pole&quot; is a weapon attainable by the player in the 2011 action RPG &quot;Dark Souls&quot; and its sequels &quot;Dark Souls II&quot; and &quot;Dark Souls III&quot;.
*In the anime and manga &quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot;, a reference to Kojiro is made, and his sword movements are repurposed as boxing punches. The first time seen in a fight against the protagonist &quot;Ippo Makunouchi&quot; the user of the &quot;flight of the swallow&quot; is &quot;Kazuki Sanada&quot;.

<doc id="317061" wikidata="Q2469205" url="?curid=317061" title="USS Doyle (FFG-39)">
<text>USS &quot;Doyle&quot; (FFG-39) was the 30th ship to be constructed in the of guided missile frigates of the United States Navy. &quot;Doyle&quot; was named after Vice Admiral James Henry Doyle (1897–1982). Vice Admiral Doyle was most known for his contributions during the Korean War as Commander Amphibious Group One. The ship was in service from 21 May 1983 to 29 July 2011. During her years of service, &quot;Doyle&quot; went on at least six deployments to the Mediterranean Sea and two deployments to the Persian Gulf, including participation in Operation Earnest Will. The ship also operated in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea, and deployed to operate with the Middle East Force. &quot;Doyle&quot; took part in UNITAS 39-98. Deployed to the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic, and conducted three Southern Command Deployments.

== History ==
Her keel was laid down by Bath Iron Works Corporation of Bath, Maine, on 23 October 1981. She was launched on 22 May 1982, sponsored by Mrs. Kathleen Doyle Watson and Ms. Anne Doyle, granddaughters of VADM Doyle. &quot;Doyle&quot; was commissioned on 21 May 1983.

&quot;Doyle&quot; deployed with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Battle Group for Med 1-87 to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean from 30 December 1986 – 30 June 1987. From 24 February to 3 March 1987, &quot;Doyle&quot; sailed in company with guided missile cruiser through the Turkish Straits and carried out freedom of navigation exercises in the Black Sea. On 1 March 1987, a Bulgarian (Druzki-class frigate (FF.12) trailed the U.S. ships, and the Soviets closely monitored their operations in the Black Sea. &quot;Doyle&quot; conducted surveillance of Soviet ships and submarines at an anchorage at Astypalaia, Greece from 3 to 12 March 1987. There were more significant incidents in adjacent years, 1986 Black Sea incident and 1988 Black Sea bumping incident.

During the fall of 1991, &quot;Doyle&quot; deployed with elements of Standing Naval Force Atlantic and embarked a CL-227 Maritime Aerial VTOL Unmanned System (MAVUS) for operational testing.

During a counter narcotics deployment to the Caribbean, 4 April – 20 June 2005, &quot;Doyle&quot;, and &quot;Cutlass 463&quot;, her embarked Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) (HSL) 46 Detachment 3, pursued fishing vessel &quot;Dos Continentes&quot;, suspected of smuggling cocaine, north of the Panamanian/Colombian coast, 3 May. The smugglers set their boat ablaze and jumped overboard. &quot;Doyle&quot; launched &quot;Cutlass 463&quot; and made for the scene at flank speed. She lowered a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) that rescued four of the smugglers, and battled the fire for several hours until they extinguished the flames during the mid watch. The ship&#x27;s damage control sailors, reinforced by Coast Guard law enforcement agents, boarded &quot;Dos Continentes&quot; and recovered several packages containing 150 pounds of cocaine from the hulk. &quot;Doyle&quot; prevented an estimated 13 tons of cocaine from entering the United States during this interception, and the U.S. later sank the vessel to prevent her from becoming a hazard to navigation. The frigate made a total of five interdictions during her deployment that led to the apprehension of 28 narco-terrorists, and the seizure or destruction of an estimated $315 million worth of cocaine (83 bales during the first month alone).

On 6 October 2005, &quot;Doyle&quot; returned from a six-month deployment.

On 6 December 2010, &quot;Doyle&quot;, her embarked SH-60B Seahawk from HSL-42, &quot;Proud Warrior 423&quot;, and her embarked Coast Guard Law Enforcement detachment, intercepted smuggling vessel &quot;Rio Tuira&quot; and seized 22 bales of cocaine, weighing approximately and with an estimated street value of $15.4 million, in the Eastern Pacific about 180 miles from Panama.

On 5 April 2011, &quot;Doyle&quot; returned from her final deployment, a six-month deployment to the United States Southern Command.

== Fate ==
&quot;Doyle&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Mayport on 29 July 2011 after completing 27 years of service.

On 23 June 2018 ex-Doyle was towed to Southern Recycling, part of EMR, for dismantling.

==Coat of arms==
The ship&#x27;s motto was displayed on an azure doubled scroll with the inscription &quot;Valiant Mariner&quot; in gold letters.

The shield contained an Azure lion rampant with fishtail and grasping a trident point up argent. Dark blue and gold are colors traditionally used by the Navy and represent the sea and excellence. The creature, half lion and half fish, with Neptune&#x27;s trident symbolized Admiral Doyle&#x27;s military prowess and accomplishments in amphibious operations.

The crest contained the following: Upon a wreath of the colors a chevron reverse coupled or interlaced with mullet points balled argent, charged with a pentagram parted and colored in the manner of the Korean Taeguk (scarlet above, azure below) and charged with a gold mullet all encircled by a wreath of laurel vert. The stars, laurel wreath and &quot;VEE&quot; refer to some of Admiral Doyle&#x27;s decorations and awards: The Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal and the Legion of Merit. The reference to the Korean Taeguk commemorates Admiral Doyle&#x27;s masterful exploits during the Korean War especially the invasion and the Hungnam withdrawal.

<doc id="317062" wikidata="Q1056761" url="?curid=317062" title="Significant figures">
<text>Significant figures, also referred to as significant digits or sig figs, are specific digits within a number written in positional notation that carry both reliability and necessity in conveying a particular quantity. When presenting the outcome of a measurement (such as length, pressure, volume, or mass), if the number of digits exceeds what the measurement instrument can resolve, only the number of digits within the resolution&#x27;s capability are dependable and therefore considered significant.

For instance, if a length measurement yields 114.8 mm, using a ruler with the smallest interval between marks at 1 mm, the first three digits (1, 1, and 4, representing 114 mm) are certain and constitute significant figures. Further, digits that are uncertain yet meaningful are also included in the significant figures. In this example, the last digit (8, contributing 0.8 mm) is likewise considered significant despite its uncertainty. Therefore, this measurement contains four significant figures.

Another example involves a volume measurement of 2.98 L with an uncertainty of ± 0.05 L. The actual volume falls between 2.93 L and 3.03 L. Even if certain digits are not completely known, they are still significant if they are meaningful, as they indicate the actual volume within an acceptable range of uncertainty. In this case, the actual volume might be 2.94 L or possibly 3.02 L, so all three digits are considered significant. Thus, there are three significant figures in this example.

The following types of digits are not considered significant:

* Leading zeros. For instance, 013 kg has two significant figures—1 and 3—while the leading zero is insignificant since it does not impact the mass indication; 013 kg is equivalent to 13 kg, rendering the zero unnecessary. Similarly, in the case of 0.056 m, there are two insignificant leading zeros since 0.056 m is the same as 56 mm, thus the leading zeros do not contribute to the length indication.
* Trailing zeros when they serve as placeholders. In the measurement 1500 m, when the measurement resolution is 100 m, the trailing zeros are insignificant as they simply stand for the tens and ones places. In this instance, 1500 m indicates the length is approximately 1500 m rather than an exact value of 1500 m.
* digits that arise from calculations resulting in a higher precision than the original data or a measurement reported with greater precision than the instrument&#x27;s resolution.

A zero after a decimal (e.g., 1.0) is significant, and care should be used when appending such a decimal of zero. Thus, in the case of 1.0, there are two significant figures, whereas 1 (without a decimal) has one significant figure.

Among a number&#x27;s significant digits, the most significant digit is the one with the greatest exponent value (the leftmost significant digit/figure), while the least significant digit is the one with the lowest exponent value (the rightmost significant digit/figure). For example, in the number &quot;123&quot; the &quot;1&quot; is the most significant digit, representing hundreds (102), while the &quot;3&quot; is the least significant digit, representing ones (100).

To avoid conveying a misleading level of precision, numbers are often rounded. For instance, it would create false precision to present a measurement as 12.34525 kg when the measuring instrument only provides accuracy to the nearest gram (0.001 kg). In this case, the significant figures are the first five digits (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) from the leftmost digit, and the number should be rounded to these significant figures, resulting in 12.345 kg as the accurate value. The rounding error (in this example, 0.00025 kg = 0.25 g) approximates the numerical resolution or precision. Numbers can also be rounded for simplicity, not necessarily to indicate measurement precision, such as for the sake of expediency in news broadcasts.

Significance arithmetic encompasses a set of approximate rules for preserving significance through calculations. More advanced scientific rules are known as the propagation of uncertainty.

Radix 10 (base-10, decimal numbers) is assumed in the following. (See unit in the last place for extending these concepts to other bases.)

== Identifying significant figures ==

=== Rules to identify significant figures in a number ===

Identifying the significant figures in a number requires knowing which digits are meaningful, which requires knowing the resolution with which the number is measured, obtained, or processed. For example, if the measurable smallest mass is 0.001 g, then in a measurement given as 0.00234 g the &quot;4&quot; is not useful and should be discarded, while the &quot;3&quot; is useful and should often be retained.
*Non-zero digits within the given measurement or reporting resolution are significant.
**91 has two significant figures (9 and 1) if they are measurement-allowed digits.
**123.45 has five significant digits (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) if they are within the measurement resolution. If the resolution is, say, 0.1, then the 5 shows that the true value to 4 sig figs is equally likely to be 123.4 or 123.5.
*Zeros between two significant non-zero digits are significant (&quot;significant&quot; &quot;trapped zeros)&quot;.
**101.12003 consists of eight significant figures if the resolution is to 0.00001.
**125.340006 has seven significant figures if the resolution is to 0.0001: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 0, and 0.
*Zeros to the left of the first non-zero digit (leading zeros) are not significant.
**If a length measurement gives 0.052 km, then 0.052 km = 52 m so 5 and 2 are only significant; the leading zeros appear or disappear, depending on which unit is used, so they are not necessary to indicate the measurement scale.
**0.00034 has 2 significant figures (3 and 4) if the resolution is 0.00001. 
*Zeros to the right of the last non-zero digit (trailing zeros) in a number with the decimal point are significant if they are within the measurement or reporting resolution.
**1.200 has four significant figures (1, 2, 0, and 0) if they are allowed by the measurement resolution.
**0.0980 has three significant digits (9, 8, and the last zero) if they are within the measurement resolution.
**120.000 consists of six significant figures (1, 2, and the four subsequent zeroes) if, as before, they are within the measurement resolution.
*Trailing zeros in an integer may or may not be significant, depending on the measurement or reporting resolution.
**45,600 has 3, 4 or 5 significant figures depending on how the last zeros are used. For example, if the length of a road is reported as 45600 m without information about the reporting or measurement resolution, then it is not clear if the road length is precisely measured as 45600 m or if it is a rough estimate. If it is the rough estimation, then only the first three non-zero digits are significant since the trailing zeros are neither reliable nor necessary; 45600 m can be expressed as 45.6 km or as 4.56 × 104 m in scientific notation, and neither expression requires the trailing zeros.
*An exact number has an infinite number of significant figures.
**If the number of apples in a bag is 4 (exact number), then this number is 4.0000... (with infinite trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point). As a result, 4 does not impact the number of significant figures or digits in the result of calculations with it.
*A mathematical or physical constant has significant figures to its known digits.
**&quot;π&quot; is a specific real number with several equivalent definitions. All of the digits in its exact decimal expansion 3.14159265358979323... are significant. Although many properties of these digits are known — for example, they do not repeat, because &quot;π&quot; is irrational — not all of the digits are known. As of March 2024, more than 102 trillion digits have been calculated. A 102 trillion-digit approximation has 102 trillion significant digits. In practical applications, far fewer digits are used. The everyday approximation 3.14 has three significant figures and 7 correct binary digits. The approximation 22/7 has the same three correct decimal digits but has 10 correct binary digits. Most calculators and computer programs can handle the 16-digit expansion 3.141592653589793, which is sufficient for interplanetary navigation calculations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA/JPL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
**The Planck constant is formula_1 and is defined as an exact value so that it is more properly defined as formula_2.

=== Ways to denote significant figures in an integer with trailing zeros ===
The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if the number 1300 is precise to the nearest unit (just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundreds due to rounding or uncertainty. Many conventions exist to address this issue. However, these are not universally used and would only be effective if the reader is familiar with the convention:

:*An overline, sometimes also called an overbar, or less accurately, a vinculum, may be placed over the last significant figure; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 130 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is precise to the nearest ten).

:*Less often, using a closely related convention, the last significant figure of a number may be underlined; for example, &quot;1300&quot; has two significant figures.

:*A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example &quot;1300.&quot; indicates specifically that trailing zeros are meant to be significant.

As the conventions above are not in general use, the following more widely recognized options are available for indicating the significance of number with trailing zeros:

:*Eliminate ambiguous or non-significant zeros by changing the unit prefix in a number with a unit of measurement. For example, the precision of measurement specified as 1300 g is ambiguous, while if stated as 1.30 kg it is not. Likewise 0.0123 L can be rewritten as 12.3 mL.

:*Eliminate ambiguous or non-significant zeros by using Scientific Notation: For example, 1300 with three significant figures becomes . Likewise 0.0123 can be rewritten as . The part of the representation that contains the significant figures (1.30 or 1.23) is known as the significand or mantissa. The digits in the base and exponent ( or ) are considered exact numbers so for these digits, significant figures are irrelevant.

:*Explicitly state the number of significant figures (the abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used): For example &quot;20 000 to 2 s.f.&quot; or &quot;20 000 (2 sf)&quot;.

:*State the expected variability (precision) explicitly with a plus–minus sign, as in 20 000 ± 1%. This also allows specifying a range of precision in-between powers of ten.

== Rounding to significant figures ==
Rounding to significant figures is a more general-purpose technique than rounding to &quot;n&quot; digits, since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way. For example, the population of a city might only be known to the nearest thousand and be stated as 52,000, while the population of a country might only be known to the nearest million and be stated as 52,000,000. The former might be in error by hundreds, and the latter might be in error by hundreds of thousands, but both have two significant figures (5 and 2). This reflects the fact that the significance of the error is the same in both cases, relative to the size of the quantity being measured.

To round a number to &quot;n&quot; significant figures:

# If the &quot;n&quot; + 1 digit is greater than 5 or is 5 followed by other non-zero digits, add 1 to the &quot;n&quot; digit. For example, if we want to round 1.2459 to 3 significant figures, then this step results in 1.25.
# If the &quot;n&quot; + 1 digit is 5 not followed by other digits or followed by only zeros, then rounding requires a tie-breaking rule. For example, to round 1.25 to 2 significant figures:
#* Round half away from zero rounds up to 1.3. This is the default rounding method implied in many disciplines if the required rounding method is not specified.
#* Round half to even, which rounds to the nearest even number. With this method, 1.25 is rounded down to 1.2. If this method applies to 1.35, then it is rounded up to 1.4. This is the method preferred by many scientific disciplines, because, for example, it avoids skewing the average value of a long list of values upwards.
# For an integer in rounding, replace the digits after the &quot;n&quot; digit with zeros. For example, if 1254 is rounded to 2 significant figures, then 5 and 4 are replaced to 0 so that it will be 1300. For a number with the decimal point in rounding, remove the digits after the &quot;n&quot; digit. For example, if 14.895 is rounded to 3 significant figures, then the digits after 8 are removed so that it will be 14.9.

In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places. For example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies. This is done because greater precision is immaterial, and usually it is not possible to settle a debt of less than the smallest currency unit.

In UK personal tax returns, income is rounded down to the nearest pound, whilst tax paid is calculated to the nearest penny.

As an illustration, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant figures or decimal places. If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision. The following table shows the results for various total precision at two rounding ways (N/A stands for Not Applicable).
Another example for 0.012345. (Remember that the leading zeros are not significant.)

The representation of a non-zero number &quot;x&quot; to a precision of &quot;p&quot; significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula:
:formula_3
:where
:formula_4
which may need to be written with a specific marking as detailed above to specify the number of significant trailing zeros.

== Writing uncertainty and implied uncertainty ==
=== Significant figures in writing uncertainty ===
It is recommended for a measurement result to include the measurement uncertainty such as formula_5, where &quot;xbest&quot; and &quot;σx&quot; are the best estimate and uncertainty in the measurement respectively. &quot;xbest&quot; can be the average of measured values and &quot;σx&quot; can be the standard deviation or a multiple of the measurement deviation. The rules to write formula_5are:

* &quot;σx&quot; should usually be quoted to only one or two significant figures, as more precision is unlikely to be reliable or meaningful:
** 1.79 ± 0.06 (correct), 1.79 ± 0.96 (correct), 1.79 ± 1.96 (incorrect).
* The digit positions of the last significant figures in &quot;xbest&quot; and &quot;σx&quot; are the same, otherwise the consistency is lost. For example, &quot;1.79 ± 0.067&quot; is incorrect, as it does not make sense to have more accurate uncertainty than the best estimate.
** 1.79 ± 0.06 (correct), 1.79 ± 0.96 (correct), 1.79 ± 0.067 (incorrect).

=== Implied uncertainty ===
Uncertainty may be implied by the last significant figure if it is not explicitly expressed. The implied uncertainty is ± the half of the minimum scale at the last significant figure position. For example, if the mass of an object is reported as 3.78 kg without mentioning uncertainty, then ± 0.005 kg measurement uncertainty may be implied. If the mass of an object is estimated as 3.78 ± 0.07 kg, so the actual mass is probably somewhere in the range 3.71 to 3.85 kg, and it is desired to report it with a single number, then 3.8 kg is the best number to report since its implied uncertainty ± 0.05 kg gives a mass range of 3.75 to 3.85 kg, which is close to the measurement range. If the uncertainty is a bit larger, i.e. 3.78 ± 0.09 kg, then 3.8 kg is still the best single number to quote, since if &quot;4 kg&quot; was reported then a lot of information would be lost.

If there is a need to write the implied uncertainty of a number, then it can be written as formula_7with stating it as the implied uncertainty (to prevent readers from recognizing it as the measurement uncertainty), where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;σx&quot; are the number with an extra zero digit (to follow the rules to write uncertainty above) and the implied uncertainty of it respectively. For example, 6 kg with the implied uncertainty ± 0.5 kg can be stated as 6.0 ± 0.5 kg.

== Arithmetic ==

As there are rules to determine the significant figures in directly &quot;measured&quot; quantities, there are also guidelines (not rules) to determine the significant figures in quantities &quot;calculated&quot; from these &quot;measured&quot; quantities.

Significant figures in &quot;measured&quot; quantities are most important in the determination of significant figures in &quot;calculated quantities&quot; with them. A mathematical or physical constant (e.g., in the formula for the area of a circle with radius as ) has no effect on the determination of the significant figures in the result of a calculation with it if its known digits are equal to or more than the significant figures in the measured quantities used in the calculation. An exact number such as in the formula for the kinetic energy of a mass with velocity as has no bearing on the significant figures in the calculated kinetic energy since its number of significant figures is infinite (0.500000...).

The guidelines described below are intended to avoid a calculation result more precise than the measured quantities, but it does not ensure the resulted implied uncertainty close enough to the measured uncertainties. This problem can be seen in unit conversion. If the guidelines give the implied uncertainty too far from the measured ones, then it may be needed to decide significant digits that give comparable uncertainty.

=== Multiplication and division ===
For quantities created from measured quantities via multiplication and division, the calculated result should have as many significant figures as the &quot;least&quot; number of significant figures among the measured quantities used in the calculation. For example, 
:* 1.234 × 2 = .468 ≈ 2
:* 1.234 × 2.0 = 2.68 ≈ 2.5
:* 0.01234 × 2 = 0.0468 ≈ 0.02
:* 0.012345678 / 0.00234 = 5.259 ≈ 5.28
with &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, and &quot;one&quot; significant figures respectively. (2 here is assumed not an exact number.) For the first example, the first multiplication factor has four significant figures and the second has one significant figure. The factor with the fewest or least significant figures is the second one with only one, so the final calculated result should also have one significant figure.

==== Exception ====
For unit conversion, the implied uncertainty of the result can be unsatisfactorily higher than that in the previous unit if this rounding guideline is followed; For example, 8 inch has the implied uncertainty of ± 0.5 inch = ± 1.27 cm. If it is converted to the centimeter scale and the rounding guideline for multiplication and division is followed, then 0.32 cm ≈ 20 cm with the implied uncertainty of ± 5 cm. If this implied uncertainty is considered as too overestimated, then more proper significant digits in the unit conversion result may be 2.32 cm ≈ 20. cm with the implied uncertainty of ± 0.5 cm.

Another exception of applying the above rounding guideline is to multiply a number by an integer, such as 1.234 × 9. If the above guideline is followed, then the result is rounded as 1.234 × 9.000... = 11.16 ≈ 11.11. However, this multiplication is essentially adding 1.234 to itself 9 times such as 1.234 + 1.234 + … + 1.234 so the rounding guideline for addition and subtraction described below is more proper rounding approach. As a result, the final answer is 1.234 + 1.234 + … + 1.234 = 11.10 = 11.106 (one significant digit increase).

=== Addition and subtraction of significant figures ===
For quantities created from measured quantities via addition and subtraction, the last significant figure position (e.g., hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, hundredths, and so forth) in the calculated result should be the same as the &quot;leftmost&quot; or largest digit position among the last significant figures of the &quot;measured&quot; quantities in the calculation. For example, 
:* 1.234 + 2 = .234 ≈ 3
:* 1.234 + 2.0 = 3.34 ≈ 3.2
:* 0.01234 + 2 = .01234 ≈ 2
:* 12000 + 77 = 1077 ≈ 12000
with the last significant figures in the &quot;ones&quot; place, &quot;tenths&quot; place, &quot;ones&quot; place, and &quot;thousands&quot; place respectively. (2 here is assumed not an exact number.) For the first example, the first term has its last significant figure in the thousandths place and the second term has its last significant figure in the &quot;ones&quot; place. The leftmost or largest digit position among the last significant figures of these terms is the ones place, so the calculated result should also have its last significant figure in the ones place.

The rule to calculate significant figures for multiplication and division are not the same as the rule for addition and subtraction. For multiplication and division, only the total number of significant figures in each of the factors in the calculation matters; the digit position of the last significant figure in each factor is irrelevant. For addition and subtraction, only the digit position of the last significant figure in each of the terms in the calculation matters; the total number of significant figures in each term is irrelevant. However, greater accuracy will often be obtained if some non-significant digits are maintained in intermediate results which are used in subsequent calculations.

=== Logarithm and antilogarithm ===
The base-10 logarithm of a normalized number (i.e., &quot;a&quot; × 10&quot;b&quot; with 1 ≤ &quot;a&quot; &lt; 10 and &quot;b&quot; as an integer), is rounded such that its decimal part (called mantissa) has as many significant figures as the significant figures in the normalized number.

* log10(3.000 × 104) = log10(104) + log10(3.000) = 4.000000... (exact number so infinite significant digits) + 0.477212547... = 4.477212547 ≈ 4.4771.

When taking the antilogarithm of a normalized number, the result is rounded to have as many significant figures as the significant figures in the decimal part of the number to be antiloged.

* 104.4771 = 2998.5318119... = 30000 = 3.000 × 104.

=== Transcendental functions ===
If a transcendental function formula_8 (e.g., the exponential function, the logarithm, and the trigonometric functions) is differentiable at its domain element &#x27;x&#x27;, then its number of significant figures (denoted as &quot;significant figures of formula_8&quot;) is approximately related with the number of significant figures in &quot;x&quot; (denoted as &quot;significant figures of &quot;x&quot;&quot;) by the formula

formula_10,

where formula_11 is the condition number.

=== Round only on the final calculation result ===
When performing multiple stage calculations, do not round intermediate stage calculation results; keep as many digits as is practical (at least one more digit than the rounding rule allows per stage) until the end of all the calculations to avoid cumulative rounding errors while tracking or recording the significant figures in each intermediate result. Then, round the final result, for example, to the fewest number of significant figures (for multiplication or division) or leftmost last significant digit position (for addition or subtraction) among the inputs in the final calculation.

* (2.3494 + 1.345) × 1.2 = 3.694 × 1.2 = 4.3328 ≈ 4.4.
* (2.3494 × 1.345) + 1.2 = 3.15943 + 1.2 = 4.59943 ≈ 4.4.

== Estimating an extra digit ==
When using a ruler, initially use the smallest mark as the first estimated digit. For example, if a ruler&#x27;s smallest mark is 0.1 cm, and 4.5 cm is read, then it is 4.5 (±0.1 cm) or 4.4 cm to 4.6 cm as to the smallest mark interval. However, in practice a measurement can usually be estimated by eye to closer than the interval between the ruler&#x27;s smallest mark, e.g. in the above case it might be estimated as between 4.51 cm and 4.53 cm.

It is also possible that the overall length of a ruler may not be accurate to the degree of the smallest mark, and the marks may be imperfectly spaced within each unit. However assuming a normal good quality ruler, it should be possible to estimate tenths between the nearest two marks to achieve an extra decimal place of accuracy. Failing to do this adds the error in reading the ruler to any error in the calibration of the ruler.

== Estimation in statistic ==

When estimating the proportion of individuals carrying some particular characteristic in a population, from a random sample of that population, the number of significant figures should not exceed the maximum precision allowed by that sample size.

== Relationship to accuracy and precision in measurement ==

Traditionally, in various technical fields, &quot;accuracy&quot; refers to the closeness of a given measurement to its true value; &quot;precision&quot; refers to the stability of that measurement when repeated many times. Thus, it is possible to be &quot;precisely wrong&quot;. Hoping to reflect the way in which the term &quot;accuracy&quot; is actually used in the scientific community, there is a recent standard, ISO 5725, which keeps the same definition of precision but defines the term &quot;trueness&quot; as the closeness of a given measurement to its true value and uses the term &quot;accuracy&quot; as the combination of trueness and precision. (See the accuracy and precision article for a full discussion.) In either case, the number of significant figures roughly corresponds to &quot;precision&quot;, not to accuracy or the newer concept of trueness. 

== In computing ==

Computer representations of floating-point numbers use a form of rounding to significant figures (while usually not keeping track of how many), in general with binary numbers. The number of correct significant figures is closely related to the notion of relative error (which has the advantage of being a more accurate measure of precision, and is independent of the radix, also known as the base, of the number system used).

Electronic calculators supporting a dedicated significant figures display mode are relatively rare.

Among the calculators to support related features are the Commodore M55 Mathematician (1976) and the S61 Statistician (1976), which support two display modes, where will give &quot;n&quot; significant digits in total, while will give &quot;n&quot; decimal places.

The Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus (1999) and TI-84 Plus (2004) families of graphical calculators support a &quot;Sig-Fig Calculator&quot; mode in which the calculator will evaluate the count of significant digits of entered numbers and display it in square brackets behind the corresponding number. The results of calculations will be adjusted to only show the significant digits as well.

For the HP 20b/30b-based community-developed WP 34S (2011) and WP 31S (2014) calculators significant figures display modes and (with zero padding) are available as a compile-time option. The SwissMicros DM42-based community-developed calculators WP 43C (2019) / C43 (2022) / C47 (2023) support a significant figures display mode as well.

<text>In international economics, the balance of payments (also known as balance of international payments and abbreviated BOP or BoP) of a country is the difference between all money flowing into the country in a particular period of time (e.g., a quarter or a year) and the outflow of money to the rest of the world. In other words, it is economic transactions between countries during a period of time. These financial transactions are made by individuals, firms and government bodies to compare receipts and payments arising out of trade of goods and services.

The balance of payments consists of three primary components: the current account, the financial account, and the capital account. The current account reflects a country&#x27;s net income, while the financial account reflects the net change in ownership of national assets. The capital account reflects a part that has little impact on the total, and represents the sum of unilateral capital account transfers, and the acquisitions and sales of non-financial and non-produced assets.

==History==
Until the early 19th century, international trade was heavily regulated and accounted for a relatively small portion compared with national output. In the Middle Ages, European trade was typically regulated at municipal level in the interests of security for local industry and for established merchants. (Annual fairs would sometimes allow exceptions to the standard regulations.)

===Mercantilism===
Beginning in the 16th century, mercantilism became the dominant economic theory influencing European rulers. Local trade regulations were replaced by national rules aiming to harness the countries&#x27; economic output. Measures to promote a trade surplus (such as tariffs) were generally favored.

The prevailing orthodoxy of the mercantilist age was the (now discredited) notion that the accumulation of foreign exchange or, at that time, precious metals, made countries wealthier, and so countries favored exporting their own goods to run balance of payments surpluses. This viewpoint prevails in &quot;England&#x27;s Treasure by Foreign Trade&quot; (1664) by Thomas Mun.

Economic growth remained at low levels in the mercantilist era; average global per capita income is not considered to have significantly risen in the whole 800 years leading up to 1820, and is estimated to have increased on average by less than 0.1% per year between 1700 and 1820. With very low levels of financial integration between nations and with international trade generally making up a low proportion of individual nations&#x27; GDP, BOP crises were very rare.

===1820–1914: Classical economics===

The mercantilist dogma was attacked first by David Hume, then Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

In the essays &quot;Of Money&quot; and &quot;Of the Balance of Trade&quot;, Hume argued that the accumulation of precious metals would create monetary inflation without any real effect on interest rates. It is the foundation of what is known in modern economic studies as the quantity theory of money, the neutrality of money and the consideration of interest rates not as a monetary phenomenon, but a real one. Adam Smith built on this foundation. He accused mercantilists of being anti-free trade and confusing money with wealth.

David Ricardo based his arguments on Say&#x27;s law, developing the theory of comparative advantage, which remains the dominant theory of growth and trade in modern economics.

After victory in the Napoleonic wars Great Britain began promoting free trade, unilaterally reducing its trade tariffs. Hoarding of gold was no longer encouraged, and in fact Britain exported more capital as a percentage of its national income than any other creditor nation has since. Great Britain&#x27;s capital exports further helped to correct global imbalances as they tended to be counter cyclical, rising when Britain&#x27;s economy went into recession, thus compensating other states for income lost from export of goods.

According to historian Carroll Quigley, Great Britain could afford to act benevolently in the 19th century due to the advantages of her geographical location, naval power, and economic ascendancy as the first nation to enjoy an Industrial Revolution. However, some, like Otto von Bismarck, viewed Great Britain&#x27;s promotion of free trade as a way to maintain its dominant position.
A view advanced by economists such as Barry Eichengreen is that the first age of Globalization began with the laying of transatlantic telegraph cables in the 1860s, which facilitated a rapid increase in the already growing trade between Britain and America.

Though Current Account controls were still widely used (in fact all industrial nations apart from Great Britain and the Netherlands actually increased their tariffs and quotas in the decades leading up to 1914, though this was motivated more by a desire to protect &quot;infant industries&quot; than to encourage a trade surplus), capital controls were largely absent.
A gold standard enjoyed wide international participation especially from 1870, further contributing to close economic integration between nations. The period saw substantial global growth, in particular for the volume of international trade which grew tenfold between 1820 and 1870 and then by about 4% annually from 1870 to 1914. BoP crises began to occur, though less frequently than was to be the case for the remainder of the 20th century. From 1880 to 1914, there were approximately eight BoP crises and eight &quot;twin crises&quot; – a twin crisis being a BoP crisis that coincides with a banking crisis.

===1914–1945: Deglobalization===

The favorable economic conditions that had prevailed up until 1914 were shattered by the first world war, and efforts to re-establish them in the 1920s were not successful. Several countries rejoined the gold standard around 1925. But surplus countries didn&#x27;t &quot;play by the rules&quot;, sterilising gold inflows to a much greater degree than had been the case in the pre-war period. Deficit nations such as Great Britain found it harder to adjust by deflation as workers were more enfranchised and unions in particular were able to resist downwards pressure on wages. During the Great Depression most countries abandoned the gold standard, but imbalances remained an issue and international trade declined sharply. There was a return to mercantilist type &quot;beggar thy neighbour&quot; policies, with countries competitively devaluing their exchange rates, thus effectively competing to export unemployment. There were approximately 16 BoP crises and 15 twin crises (and a comparatively very high level of banking crises).

===1945–1971: Bretton Woods===

Following World War II, the Bretton Woods institutions (the International Monetary Fund and World Bank) were set up to support an international monetary system, among capitalist economies, designed to encourage free trade while also offering states options to correct imbalances without having to deflate their economies. Fixed but flexible exchange rates were established, with the system anchored by the US dollar which alone remained convertible into gold. The Bretton Woods system ushered in a period of high global growth, known as the Golden Age of Capitalism. However, it came under pressure due to the inability or unwillingness of governments to maintain effective capital controls and due to instabilities related to the central role of the US dollar.

Imbalances caused gold to flow out of the US and a loss of confidence in the United States&#x27; ability to supply gold for all future claims by US dollar holders resulted in escalating demands to convert US dollars, ultimately causing the US to end the convertibility of the US dollar into gold, thus ending the Bretton Woods system. The 1945–71 era saw approximately 24 BoP crises and no twin crisis for advanced economies, with emerging economies seeing 16 BoP crises and just one twin crisis.

===1971–2009: Transition, Washington Consensus, Bretton Woods II===
The Bretton Woods system came to an end between 1971 and 1973. There were attempts to repair the system of fixed exchanged rates over the next few years, but these were soon abandoned, as were determined efforts for the U.S. to avoid BoP imbalances. Part of the reason was displacement of the previous dominant economic paradigm – Keynesianism – by the Washington Consensus, with economists and economics writers such as Murray Rothbard and Milton Friedman arguing that there was no great need to be concerned about BoP issues.

In the immediate aftermath of the Bretton Woods collapse, countries generally tried to retain some control over their exchange rate by independently managing it, or by intervening in the foreign exchange market as part of a regional bloc, such as the Snake which formed in 1971. &quot;The Snake&quot; was a group of European countries who tried to retain stable rates at least with each other; the group eventually evolved into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) by 1979. From the mid-1970s however, and especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, many other countries followed the US in liberalizing controls on both their capital and current accounts, in adopting a somewhat relaxed attitude to their balance of payments and in allowing the value of their currency to float relatively freely with exchange rates determined mostly by the market.

Developing countries who chose to allow the market to determine their exchange rates would often develop sizable current account deficits, financed by capital account inflows such as loans and investments, though this often ended in crises when investors lost confidence. The frequency of crises was especially high for developing economies in this era – from 1973 to 1997 emerging economies suffered 57 BoP crises and 21 twin crises. Typically but not always the panic among foreign creditors and investors that preceded the crises in this period was triggered by concerns over excess borrowing by the private sector, rather than by a government deficit. For advanced economies, there were 30 BoP crises and 6 banking crises.

A turning point was the 1997 Asian financial crisis, where unsympathetic responses by western powers caused policy makers in emerging economies to re-assess the wisdom of relying on the free market; by 1999 the developing world as a whole stopped running current account deficits while the U.S. current account deficit began to rise sharply.
This new form of imbalance began to develop in part due to the increasing practice of emerging economies, principally China, in pegging their currency against the dollar, rather than allowing the value to freely float. The resulting state of affairs has been referred to as Bretton Woods II. According to Alaistair Chan, &quot;At the heart of the imbalance is China&#x27;s desire to keep the value of the yuan stable against the dollar. Usually, a rising trade surplus leads to a rising value of the currency. A rising currency would make exports more expensive, imports less so, and push the trade surplus towards balance. China circumvents the process by intervening in exchange markets and keeping the value of the yuan depressed.&quot;
According to economics writer Martin Wolf, in the eight years leading up to 2007, &quot;three-quarters of the foreign currency reserves accumulated since the beginning of time have been piled up&quot;.
In contrast to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervened to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon need to be addressed from as early as 2001, but it was not until about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.

==Exchange rate regime==
Under a fixed exchange rate system, a central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the foreign exchange market to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the exchange rate between the country&#x27;s currency and other currencies. Then the net change per year in the central bank&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a fixed exchange rate system include a managed float where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely floating exchange rate (also known as a purely &quot;flexible&quot; exchange rate). With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its currency, allowing the rate to be set by the market, the central bank&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.

==Components==

The current account shows the net amount of a country&#x27;s income if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the balance of trade (net earnings on exports minus payments for imports), factor income (earnings on foreign investments minus payments made to foreign investors) and unilateral transfers. These items include transfers of goods and services or financial assets between the home country and the rest of the world. Private transfer payments refer to gifts made by individuals and nongovernmental institutions to foreigners. Governmental transfers refer to gifts or grants made by one government to foreign residents or foreign governments. When investment income and unilateral transfers are combined with the balance on goods and services, we arrive at the current account balance. It is called the &quot;current&quot; account as it covers transactions in the &quot;here and now&quot; – those that don&#x27;t give rise to future claims.
The capital account records the net change in ownership of foreign assets. It includes the reserve account (the foreign exchange market operations of a nation&#x27;s central bank), along with loans and investments between the country and the rest of world (but not the future interest payments and dividends that the loans and investments yield; those are earnings and will be recorded in the current account). If a country purchases more foreign assets for cash than the assets it sells for cash to other countries, the capital account is said to be negative or in deficit.

The term &quot;capital account&quot; is also used in the narrower sense that excludes central bank foreign exchange market operations: Sometimes the reserve account is classified as &quot;below the line&quot; and so not reported as part of the capital account.

Expressed with the broader meaning for the &quot;capital account&quot;, the BoP identity states that any current account surplus will be balanced by a capital account deficit of equal size – or alternatively a current account deficit will be balanced by a corresponding capital account surplus:

: formula_1

The &quot;balancing item&quot;, which may be positive or negative, is simply an amount that accounts for any statistical errors and assures that the current and capital accounts sum to zero. By the principles of double entry accounting, an entry in the current account gives rise to an entry in the capital account, and in aggregate the two accounts automatically balance. A balance isn&#x27;t always reflected in reported figures for the current and capital accounts, which might, for example, report a surplus for both accounts, but when this happens it always means something has been missed – most commonly, the operations of the country&#x27;s central bank – and what has been missed is recorded in the statistical discrepancy term (the balancing item).

An actual balance sheet will typically have numerous sub headings under the principal divisions. For example, entries under Current account might include:
* &quot;Trade&quot; – buying and selling of goods and services
** &quot;Exports&quot; – a credit entry
** &quot;Imports&quot; – a debit entry
*** &quot;Trade balance&quot; – the sum of Exports and Imports
* &quot;Factor income&quot; – repayments and dividends from loans and investments
** &quot;Factor earnings&quot; – a credit entry
** &quot;Factor payments&quot; – a debit entry
*** &quot;Factor income balance&quot; – the sum of earnings and payments.

Especially in older balance sheets, a common division was between visible and invisible entries. Visible trade recorded imports and exports of physical goods (entries for trade in physical goods excluding services is now often called the &quot;merchandise balance&quot;). Invisible trade would record international buying and selling of services, and sometimes would be grouped with transfer and factor income as invisible earnings.

The term &quot;balance of payments surplus&quot; (or deficit – a deficit is simply a negative surplus) refers to the sum of the surpluses in the current account and the narrowly defined capital account (excluding changes in central bank reserves). Denoting the balance of payments surplus as BoP surplus, the relevant identity is

: formula_2

===Measurements and definitions===
The balance of payments takes into account payments for a country&#x27;s exports and imports of goods, services, financial capital, and financial transfers.
It is prepared in a single currency, typically the domestic currency for the country concerned. The balance of payments accounts keep systematic records of all the economic transactions (visible and non-visible) of a country with all other countries in the given time period. In the BoP accounts, all the receipts from abroad are recorded as credit and all the payments to abroad are debits. Since the accounts are maintained by double entry bookkeeping, they show the balance of payments accounts are always balanced. Sources of funds for a nation, such as exports or the receipts of loans and investments, are recorded as positive or surplus items. Uses of funds, such as for imports or to invest in foreign countries, are recorded as negative or deficit items.

When all components of the BoP accounts are included they must sum to zero with no overall surplus or deficit. For example, if a country is importing more than it exports, its trade balance will be in deficit, but the shortfall will have to be counterbalanced in other ways – such as by funds earned from its foreign investments (but not the investments themselves, since foreign investments are deficit items), by running down currency reserves or by receiving investments or loans from other countries.

While the overall BoP accounts will always balance when all types of payments are included, imbalances are possible on individual elements of the BoP, such as the current account, the capital account excluding the central bank&#x27;s reserve account, or the sum of the two. Imbalances in the latter sum can result in surplus countries accumulating wealth, while deficit nations become increasingly indebted. The term &quot;balance of payments&quot; often refers to this sum: a country&#x27;s balance of payments is said to be in surplus (equivalently, the balance of payments is positive) by a specific amount if sources of funds (such as export goods sold and bonds sold) exceed uses of funds (such as paying for imported goods and paying for foreign bonds purchased) by that amount. There is said to be a balance of payments deficit (the balance of payments is said to be negative) if the former are less than the latter. A BoP surplus (or deficit) is accompanied by an accumulation (or decumulation) of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.

===Variations in the use of term &quot;balance of payments&quot;===

Economics writer J. Orlin Grabbe warns the term &quot;balance of payments&quot; can be a source of misunderstanding due to divergent expectations about what the term denotes. Grabbe says the term is sometimes misused by people who aren&#x27;t aware of the accepted meaning, not only in general conversation but in financial publications and the economic literature.

A common source of confusion arises from whether or not the &quot;reserve account&quot; entry, part of the &quot;capital account&quot;, is included in the BoP accounts. The reserve account records the activity of the nation&#x27;s central bank. If it is excluded, the BoP can be in surplus (which implies the central bank is building up foreign exchange reserves) or in deficit (which implies the central bank is running down its reserves or borrowing from abroad).

The term &quot;balance of payments&quot; is sometimes misused by non-economists to mean just relatively narrow parts of the BoP such as the trade deficit, which means excluding parts of the current account and the entire capital account.

Another cause of confusion is the different naming conventions in use. Before 1973 there was no standard way to break down the BoP sheet, with the separation into invisible and visible payments sometimes being the principal divisions. The IMF have their own standards for BoP accounting which is equivalent to the standard definition but uses different nomenclature, in particular with respect to the meaning given to the term &quot;capital account&quot;.

===The IMF definition of the Balance of Payments===

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) use a particular set of definitions for the BoP accounts, which is also used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA).

The main difference in the IMF&#x27;s terminology is that it uses the term &quot;financial account&quot; to capture transactions that would under alternative definitions be recorded in the &quot;capital account&quot;. The IMF uses the term &quot;capital account&quot; to designate a subset of transactions that, according to other usage, previously formed a small part of the overall current account. The IMF separates these transactions out to form an additional top level division of the BoP accounts. Expressed with the IMF definition, the BoP identity can be written:

: formula_3

The IMF uses the term &quot;current account&quot; with the same meaning as that used by other organizations, although it has its own names for its three leading sub-divisions, which are:
* The &quot;goods and services account&quot; (the overall trade balance)
* The &quot;primary income account&quot; (factor income such as from loans and investments)
* The &quot;secondary income account&quot; (transfer payments)

==Uses==

The balance of payments is important in international financial management for the following reasons:

First, the balance of payments is a factor in the demand and supply of a country&#x27;s currency. For example, if outflows exceed inflows, then the demand for the currency in the domestic market is likely to exceed the supply in the foreign exchange market, all else being equal. One can thus infer that the currency would be under pressure to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if inflows exceed outflows, then its currency would be likely to appreciate.

Second, a country&#x27;s balance of payments data may signal the country&#x27;s potential as a business partner for the rest of the world. A country grappling with a major balance of payments difficulty may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country may impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance of payments situation. On the other hand, a country with a significant balance of payments surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign exchange restrictions.

Third, balance of payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. A country that is experiencing trade deficits year after year may be a signal that the country&#x27;s domestic industries lack international competitiveness.

==Imbalances==
While the BoP has to balance overall, surpluses or deficits on its individual elements can lead to imbalances between countries. In general there is concern over deficits in the current account.
Countries with deficits in their current accounts will build up increasing debt or see increased foreign ownership of their assets. The types of deficits that typically raise concern are
* A &quot;visible trade deficit&quot; where a nation is importing more physical goods than it exports (even if this is balanced by the other components of the current account.)
* An overall &quot;current account deficit&quot;.
* A &quot;basic deficit&quot; which is the current account plus foreign direct investment (but excluding other elements of the capital account like short terms loans and the reserve account.)

The &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; period saw a swing of opinion towards the view that there is no need to worry about imbalances. Opinion swung back in the opposite direction during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Mainstream opinion expressed by the leading financial press and economists, international bodies like the IMF – as well as leaders of surplus and deficit countries – has returned to the view that large current account imbalances do matter. For instance, in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic the Armenian current account deficit has increased from $0.7 billion to $1.3 billion. Some economists do, however, remain relatively unconcerned about imbalances
and there have been assertions, such as by Michael P. Dooley, David Folkerts-Landau and Peter Garber, that nations need to avoid the temptation to switch to protectionism as a means to correct imbalances.

Current account surpluses coincide with current account deficits of other countries, the indebtedness of the latter therefore increasing. According to Balances Mechanics by Wolfgang Stützel this is described as surplus of expenses over revenues. Increasing imbalances in foreign trade are critically discussed as a possible cause of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Many Keynesian economists consider the existing differences between the current accounts in the eurozone to be the root cause of the Euro crisis, for instance Heiner Flassbeck, Paul Krugman or Joseph Stiglitz.

===Causes of BoP imbalances===
There are conflicting views as to the primary cause of BoP imbalances, with much attention on the US which currently has by far the biggest deficit. The conventional view is that current account factors are the primary cause – these include the exchange rate, the government&#x27;s fiscal deficit, business competitiveness, and private behaviour such as the willingness of consumers to go into debt to finance extra consumption.

An alternative view, argued at length in a 2005 paper by Ben Bernanke, is that the primary driver is the capital account, where a global savings glut caused by savers in surplus countries, runs ahead of the available investment opportunities, and is pushed into the US resulting in excess consumption and asset price inflation.

===Reserve asset===

In the context of BoP and international monetary systems, the reserve asset is the currency or other store of value that is primarily used by nations for their foreign reserves. BoP imbalances tend to manifest as hoards of the reserve asset being amassed by surplus countries, with deficit countries building debts denominated in the reserve asset or at least depleting their supply. Under a gold standard, the reserve asset for all members of the standard is gold. In the Bretton Woods system, either gold or the U.S. dollar could serve as the reserve asset, though its smooth operation depended on countries apart from the US choosing to keep most of their holdings in dollars.

Following the ending of Bretton Woods, there has been no &quot;de jure&quot; reserve asset, but the US dollar has remained by far the principal &quot;de facto&quot; reserve. Global reserves rose sharply in the first decade of the 21st century, partly as a result of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, where several nations ran out of foreign currency needed for essential imports and thus had to accept deals on unfavourable terms. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that between 2000 and mid-2009, official reserves rose from $1,900bn to $6,800bn.

Global reserves had peaked at about $7,500bn in mid-2008, then declined by about $430bn as countries without their own reserve currency used them to shield themselves from the worst effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. From Feb 2009 global reserves began increasing again to reach close to $9,200bn by the end of 2010.

, approximately 65% of the world&#x27;s $6,800bn total is held in U.S. dollars and approximately 25% in euros. The UK pound, Japanese yen, IMF special drawing rights (SDRs), and precious metals also play a role. In 2009, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People&#x27;s Bank of China, proposed a gradual move towards increased use of SDRs, and also for the national currencies backing SDRs to be expanded to include the currencies of all major economies.

While the current central role of the dollar does give the US some advantages, such as lower cost of borrowings, it also contributes to the pressure causing the U.S. to run a current account deficit, due to the Triffin dilemma. In a November 2009 article published in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine, economist C. Fred Bergsten argued that Zhou&#x27;s suggestion or a similar change to the international monetary system would be in the best interests of the United States as well as the rest of the world. Since 2009 there has been a notable increase in the number of new bilateral agreements which enable international trades to be transacted using a currency that is not a traditional reserve asset, such as the renminbi, as the settlement currency.

===Balance of payments crisis===

A BoP crisis, also called a &quot;currency crisis&quot;, occurs when a nation is unable to pay for essential imports or service its external debt repayments. Typically, this is accompanied by a rapid decline in the value of the affected nation&#x27;s currency. Crises are generally preceded by large capital inflows, which are associated at first with rapid economic growth. However a point is reached where overseas investors become concerned about the level of debt their inbound capital is generating, and decide to pull out their funds. It sometimes takes only one or two large investors pulling out to trigger a mass panic due to herd effects. The resulting outbound capital flows are associated with a rapid drop in the value of the affected nation&#x27;s currency. This causes issues for firms of the affected nation who have received the inbound investments and loans, as the revenue of those firms is typically mostly derived domestically but their debts are often denominated in a reserve currency. Once the nation&#x27;s government has exhausted its foreign reserves trying to support the value of the domestic currency, its policy options are very limited. It can raise its interest rates to try to prevent further declines in the value of its currency, but while this can help those with debts denominated in foreign currencies, it generally further depresses the local economy. Lower-income countries are more exposed to suffer this type of crisis, while economic growth and foreign-exchange piling are particularly useful to prevent them.

==Balancing mechanisms==
One of the three fundamental functions of an international monetary system is to provide mechanisms to correct imbalances.

Broadly speaking, there are three possible methods to correct BoP imbalances, though in practice a mixture including some degree of at least the first two methods tends to be used. These methods are adjustments of exchange rates; adjustment of a nations internal prices along with its levels of demand; and rules based adjustment. Improving productivity and hence competitiveness can also help, as can increasing the desirability of exports through other means, though it is generally assumed a nation is always trying to develop and sell its products to the best of its abilities.

===Rebalancing by changing the exchange rate===
An upwards shift in the value of a nation&#x27;s currency relative to others will make a nation&#x27;s exports less competitive and make imports cheaper and so will tend to correct a current account surplus. It also tends to make investment flows into the capital account less attractive so will help with a surplus there too. Conversely a downward shift in the value of a nation&#x27;s currency makes it more expensive for its citizens to buy imports and increases the competitiveness of their exports, thus helping to correct a deficit (though the solution often doesn&#x27;t have a positive impact immediately due to the Marshall–Lerner condition).

Exchange rates can be adjusted by government in a rules based or managed currency regime, and when left to float freely in the market they also tend to change in the direction that will restore balance. When a country is selling more than it imports, the demand for its currency will tend to increase as other countries ultimately need the selling country&#x27;s currency to make payments for the exports. The extra demand tends to cause a rise of the currency&#x27;s price relative to others. When a country is importing more than it exports, the supply of its own currency on the international market tends to increase as it tries to exchange it for foreign currency to pay for its imports, and this extra supply tends to cause the price to fall. BoP effects are not the only market influence on exchange rates however, they are also influenced by differences in national interest rates and by speculation.

===Rebalancing by adjusting internal prices and demand===
When exchange rates are fixed by a rigid gold standard, or when imbalances exist between members of a currency union such as the Eurozone, the standard approach to correct imbalances is by making changes to the domestic economy. To a large degree, the change is optional for the surplus country, but compulsory for the deficit country. In the case of a gold standard, the mechanism is largely automatic. When a country has a favourable trade balance, as a consequence of selling more than it buys it will experience a net inflow of gold. The natural effect of this will be to increase the money supply, which leads to inflation and an increase in prices, which then tends to make its goods less competitive and so will decrease its trade surplus. However the nation has the option of taking the gold out of economy (sterilising the inflationary effect) thus building up a hoard of gold and retaining its favourable balance of payments. On the other hand, if a country has an adverse BoP it will experience a net loss of gold, which will automatically have a deflationary effect, unless it chooses to leave the gold standard. Prices will be reduced, making its exports more competitive, and thus correcting the imbalance. While the gold standard is generally considered to have been successful up until 1914, correction by deflation to the degree required by the large imbalances that arose after WWI proved painful, with deflationary policies contributing to prolonged unemployment but not re-establishing balance. Apart from the US most former members had left the gold standard by the mid-1930s.

A possible method for surplus countries such as Germany to contribute to re-balancing efforts when exchange rate adjustment is not suitable, is to increase its level of internal demand (i.e. its spending on goods). While a current account surplus is commonly understood as the excess of earnings over spending, an alternative expression is that it is the excess of savings over investment.

That is:
: formula_4
where &quot;CA&quot; = current account, &quot;NS&quot; = national savings (private plus government sector), &quot;NI&quot; = national investment.

If a nation is earning more than it spends the net effect will be to build up savings, except to the extent that those savings are being used for investment. If consumers can be encouraged to spend more instead of saving; or if the government runs a fiscal deficit to offset private savings; or if the corporate sector divert more of their profits to investment, then any current account surplus will tend to be reduced. However, in 2009 Germany amended its constitution to prohibit running a deficit greater than 0.35% of its GDP and calls to reduce its surplus by increasing demand have not been welcome by officials, adding to fears that the 2010s would not be an easy decade for the eurozone. In their April 2010 world economic outlook report, the IMF presented a study showing how with the right choice of policy options governments can shift away from a sustained current account surplus with no negative effect on growth and with a positive impact on unemployment.

===Rules based rebalancing mechanisms===
Nations can agree to fix their exchange rates against each other, and then correct any imbalances that arise by rules based and negotiated exchange rate changes and other methods. The Bretton Woods system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates was an example of a rules based system. John Maynard Keynes, one of the architects of the Bretton Woods system had wanted additional rules to encourage surplus countries to share the burden of rebalancing, as he argued that they were in a stronger position to do so and as he regarded their surpluses as negative externalities imposed on the global economy.
Keynes suggested that traditional balancing mechanisms should be supplemented by the threat of confiscation of a portion of excess revenue if the surplus country did not choose to spend it on additional imports. However his ideas were not accepted by the Americans at the time. In 2008 and 2009, American economist Paul Davidson had been promoting his revamped form of Keynes&#x27;s plan as a possible solution to global imbalances which in his opinion would expand growth all round without the downside risk of other rebalancing methods.

==Post-Washington Consensus developments==
Speaking after the 2009 G-20 London summit, Gordon Brown announced &quot;the Washington Consensus is over&quot;.
There is now broad agreement that large imbalances between different countries do matter; for example mainstream U.S. economist C. Fred Bergsten has argued the U.S. deficit and the associated large inbound capital flows into the U.S. was one of the causes of the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
Since the crisis, government intervention in BOP areas such as the imposition of capital controls or foreign exchange market intervention has become more common and in general attracts less disapproval from economists, international institutions like the IMF and other governments.

In 2007, when the crises began, the global total of yearly BoP imbalances was $1680 billion. On the credit side, the biggest current account surplus was China with approx. $362 billion, followed by Japan at $213 billion and Germany at £185 billion, with oil producing countries such as Saudi Arabia also having large surpluses.
On the debit side, the US had the biggest current account deficit at over $1100 billion, with the UK, Spain and Australia together accounting for close to a further $300 billion.

While there have been warnings of future cuts in public spending, deficit countries on the whole did not make these in 2009, in fact the opposite happened with increased public spending contributing to recovery as part of global efforts to increase demand. The emphases has instead been on the surplus countries, with the IMF, EU and nations such as the U.S., Brazil and Russia asking them to assist with the adjustments to correct the imbalances.

Economists such as Gregor Irwin and Philip R. Lane have suggested that increased use of pooled reserves could help emerging economies not to require such large reserves and thus have less need for current account surpluses.

Writing for the FT in Jan 2009, Gillian Tett says she expects to see policy makers becoming increasingly concerned about exchange rates over the coming year.

In June 2009, Olivier Blanchard the chief economist of the IMF wrote that rebalancing the world economy by reducing both sizeable surpluses and deficits will be a requirement for sustained recovery.

In 2008 and 2009, there was some reduction in imbalances, but early indications towards the end of 2009 were that major imbalances such as the U.S. current account deficit are set to begin increasing again.

Japan had allowed its currency to appreciate through 2009, but has only limited scope to contribute to the rebalancing efforts thanks in part to its aging population. The euro used by Germany is allowed to float fairly freely in value, however further appreciation would be problematic for other members of the currency union such as Spain, Greece and Ireland who run large deficits. Therefore, Germany has instead been asked to contribute by further promoting internal demand, but this hasn&#x27;t been welcomed by German officials.

China has been requested to allow the renminbi (Chinese Yuan) to appreciate but until 2010 had refused, the position expressed by its premier Wen Jiabao being that by keeping the value of the renmimbi stable against the US dollar China has been helping the global recovery, and that calls to let its currency rise in value have been motivated by a desire to hold back China&#x27;s development. After China reported favourable results for December 2009 exports however, the Financial Times reported that analysts are optimistic that China will allow some appreciation of its currency around mid-2010.

In April 2010 a Chinese official signalled the government is considering allowing the renminbi to appreciate, but by May analysts were widely reporting the appreciation would likely be delayed due to the falling value of the Euro following the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis. China announced the end of the renminbi&#x27;s peg to the US dollar in June 2010; the move was widely welcomed by markets and helped defuse tension over imbalances prior to the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit. However the renminbi remains managed and the new flexibility means it can move down as well as up in value; two months after the peg ended the renminbi had only appreciated against the US dollar by about 0.8%.

By January 2011, the renminbi had appreciated against the US dollar by 3.7%, which means it&#x27;s on track to appreciate in nominal terms by 6% per year. As this reflects a real appreciation of 10% when China&#x27;s higher inflation is accounted for, the U.S. Treasury once again declined to label China a currency manipulator in their February 2011 report to Congress. However, Treasury officials did advise that the rate of appreciation was still too slow for the best interests of the global economy.

In February 2011, Moody&#x27;s analyst Alaistair Chan has predicted that despite a strong case for an upward revaluation, an increased rate of appreciation against the US dollar is unlikely in the short term. And as of February 2012, China&#x27;s currency had been continuing to appreciate for a year and a half, while drawing remarkably little notice.

While some leading surplus countries including China have been taking steps to boost domestic demand, these have not yet been sufficient to rebalance out of their current account surpluses. By June 2010, the U.S. monthly current account deficit had risen back to $50 billion, a level not seen since mid-2008. With the US currently suffering from high unemployment and concerned about taking on additional debt, fears are rising that the US may resort to protectionist measures.

===Competitive devaluation after 2009===

By September 2010, international tensions relating to imbalances had further increased. Brazil&#x27;s finance minister Guido Mantega declared that an &quot;international currency war&quot; has broken out, with countries competitively trying to devalue their currency so as to boost exports. Brazil has been one of the few major economies lacking a reserve currency to abstain from significant currency intervention, with the real rising by 25% against the US dollar since January 2009. Some economists such as Barry Eichengreen have argued that competitive devaluation may be a good thing as the net result will effectively be equivalent to expansionary global monetary policy. Others such as Martin Wolf saw risks of tensions further escalating and advocated that coordinated action for addressing imbalances should be agreed on at the November G20 summit.

Commentators largely agreed that little substantive progress was made on imbalances at the November 2010 G20. An IMF report released after the summit warned that without additional progress there is a risk of imbalances approximately doubling to reach pre-crises levels by 2014.

== Economic policy and the balance of payment ==

Balance of payments and international headcount data is critical to the formulation of national and international economic policies. The balance of payments imbalances and foreign direct investment (FDI) is crucial for a country&#x27;s policymakers to seek solutions. The impact of national and international policies can be seen in the balance of payments data. For example, one country may implement a policy to attract foreign investment. In contrast, another country may want to keep its currency relatively low to stimulate exports. Although a country&#x27;s balance of payments will bring its current account and capital account into balance, there will be imbalances between countries&#x27; accounts. According to the World Bank data, the current account deficit in the United States is $498 billion in 2019 (The World Bank)

Suppose a country&#x27;s balance of payments deficits are persistent. In that case, the country may suffer from a loss of confidence as its foreign exchange reserves deplete. At the same time, it makes the country very vulnerable to seasonal, cyclical or unpredictable fluctuations in foreign countries. It could lead to excessive inflation at home. Therefore, the stability of currency provides a strong guarantee for the sustainable development of the economy. Countries can analyze the current economic situation domestically and internationally through the annual balance of payment and formulate effective monetary policy combined with the political influence of international and multilateral relations (Zolotas and Ethymiou 1965)

The economic policy objectives could, in principle, serve as the standard for the balance of payments policies. At the same time, exchange rate policy is treated as income policy. F. De Roos (1982) argues that only equilibrium of the balance of payments can be considered as a long term criterion for the balance of payments policy in the case of stable exchange rates. In the case of flexible exchange rates, the criterion can be found in the degree of domestic economic stability.

<doc id="317065" wikidata="Q1385286" url="?curid=317065" title="Sugita Genpaku">
<text>was a Japanese physician and scholar known for his translation of &quot;Kaitai Shinsho&quot; (New Book of Anatomy) and a founder of &quot;Rangaku&quot; (Western learning) and &quot;Ranpō&quot; (Dutch style medicine) in Japan. He was one of the first Japanese scholars in Edo (modern day Tokyo) to study the Dutch language and is credited with being one of the first Japanese physicians to study Western medical teachings in Japan.

In 1771 Genpaku and Maeno Ryōtaku, a Japanese scholar studying the Dutch language, translated a Dutch book of anatomy &quot;Ontleedkundige Tafelen&quot;, originally published in German by physician and professor Johann Adam Kulmus in 1734. Genpaku was inspired to translate the Dutch text after witnessing the dissection of a female criminal while viewing &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot; as an anatomical reference throughout the dissection. He was inspired by the German drawings of human organs, which accurately depicted the organs and vasculature he saw during the dissection. The German drawings were more anatomically detailed and accurate than Chinese texts and after the dissection he and his colleagues made it their scholarly mission to produce a Japanese translation of the &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot;. It took three full years and eleven manuscripts to produce the first translation of the text entitled &quot;Kaitai Shinsho&quot; in 1774.

== Early life ==
Born in the Wakasa-Obama estate of Feudal Lord Wakasa in 1733, Genpaku was the son of a physician, Hosen Sugita, who was the official doctor of Feudal Lord Wakasa. Genpaku&#x27;s mother, daughter of Genkō Yomogida, died during childbirth. Around age 17, Genpaku began studying surgery under Gentetsu Nishi. He also studied Confucianism under Saburoemon Miyase. Genpaku moved away from his father&#x27;s home at age 25 after being granted permission from his liege lord to begin working as a medical practitioner. His first business was located at 4-chōme, Nihonbashidōri and was attached to the home of painter Sekkei Kusumoto.

== Career ==
Genpaku was forced to relocate his medical practice from Nihonbashidōri-dōri to Hakoya-chō in 1759 and later to Horidome-chō in 1762, both due to losing his property from fires. He later left Horidome-chō and moved to property owned by Feudal Lord Sakai around 1770.

Under the rule of the Tokogawa shoguns, Genpaku lived in a period Japanese isolation from the Western world and most of East Asia. The period of isolation, &quot;sakoku&quot;, was driven by the shogun&#x27;s desire to halt the spread of Christianity propagated largely by Portuguese missionaries. During this period, Nagasaki was the only port of entry and only Holland was allowed to enter Japan, as their transactions were understood to be exclusively pertaining to trade. In the early eighteenth century, Western texts were severely restricted in Japan and Western knowledge predominately spread orally, mediated through translators whose grasp of Japanese was limited. As relations evolved with the Dutch, the eighth shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune (ruled 1716–45), allowed &quot;Rangaku&quot; (Western learning) to take hold in Japan. Yoshimune launched efforts to systematically study Dutch in 1740, giving rise to the scholarly pursuit of &quot;rangaku,&quot; however this learning was still restricted from the general public. In many cases by the police who were known to destroy Dutch texts. In mid eighteenth century, Dutch books became sought after as scholarly texts by the Japanese, and it was during this time that Genpaku came into the medical profession.

With the acceptance of &quot;rangaku&quot;, Dutch physicians presented lectures and demonstrations to the Shōgun in Edo. Genpaku attended one such demonstration in 1768 where a Dutch surgeon, Rudolf Bauer, cured a patient with gangrene of the tongue by drawing blood from the infected area.

As a practicing physician and scholar of surgery, Genpaku was aware of physician Tōyō Yamawaki&#x27;s (1705–62) observations through dissection, though only through second hand information from physician Genteki Kosugi. Yamawaki first witnessed dissection of a beheaded criminal on February 7, 1754, and it is thought that his interest in witnessing dissection arose from his possession of a German anatomical text &quot;Syntagma Anatomicum&quot;. An account of Yamawaki&#x27;s observations were published as &quot;Zōshi&quot; (Description of the organs), and this text is credited as the beginning of experimental anatomy in Japan. Also in possession of a Western anatomical text, &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot;, Genpaku was interested by the opportunity to witness a dissection.

As a physician practicing during the Tokugawa shogun, Genpaku and his contemporary physicians are often referred to as &quot;Tokugawa physicians.&quot; Collectively, these physicians shared a sentiment of radical social equality. Genpaku wrote in &quot;Keiei yawa&quot;:Other than the differences between males and females, there are no distinctive differences between human beings, from the emperor to all commoners. Where there are no differences, then, humans themselves have artificially created above and below, and the names of the four social statuses. Yet there is no difference between us, because we are all human.Such ideas of equality were not widely accepted in the class based Japanese society, but particularly before Western learning from Dutch travellers began to spread within scholarly communities, Japanese physicians already have a belief in nature as the foundation for truth and the body as an extension of nature. Tokugawa physicians expanded their regard for the body to a responsibility to protect the wellness of the body as a shared logic of nature. The introduction of Western medicine in Japan occurred without colonization efforts, which allowed the Tokugawa physicians to use Western medicine for performing humanitarian medical acts without the spread of western religions that usually comes with it.

=== Translating &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot; ===
On March 4, 1771 Genpaku and colleagues Maeno Ryōtaku, Hoshū Katsuragawa, and Junan Nakagawa witnessed a dissection of a female criminal, Aocha-Baba (&quot;Green Tea Hag&quot;), who was executed by beheading. According to court records, the woman was executed for killing her adopted children. Genpaku and Ryōtaku watched the dissection while referencing &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot; and were struck by the anatomical accuracy of the text, which different greatly from the Chinese texts and understanding of anatomy they previously held. On their walk home from the execution grounds where they witnessed the dissection, Genpaku and Ryōtaku decided to dedicate themselves to making a Japanese translation of &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot;.

Translating &quot;Ontleekundige Tafelen&quot; took Genpaku and Ryōtaku three full years and at least eleven manuscripts before the final product, &quot;Kaitai Shinsho,&quot; was published in 1774. With only Maeno&#x27;s 600 word Dutch vocabulary to complete the translation, the first edition of &quot;Kaitai Shinsho&quot; was crude and contained errors and omissions. However, the text is still regarded as a turning point in the introduction of Western medicine in Japan.

=== Teaching &quot;Rangaku&quot; ===
Genpaku took on many students in the emerging field of &quot;Rangaku&quot;, including Gentaku Otsuki (1757–1827). Considered one of his most fastidious students in the study of Dutch, after six years of study under Genpaku, Otsuki went on to study Dutch more closely in Nagasaki. This education enabled him to become a proficient Dutch translator. Otsuki went on to rewrite the translation of &quot;Kaitai Shinsho&quot;, published in 1788, and publish an original text &quot;Yōi Shinsho&quot; (New book on surgery) in 1790. Otsuki is most recognized for his work &quot;Rangaku Kaitai&quot; (Ladder to Dutch study) published in 1788, which was a text credited with fostered Dutch and Western learning in Japan.

== Later life and legacy ==

Genpaku continued to collect Dutch texts and build a robust medical library. After mentoring many students in Rangaku—including Gentaku Otsuki, Shojuro Arai, and Genzui Udagawa—Genpaku began spending more time working as a physician than as a scholar towards the end of his life. One of Genpaku&#x27;s last students was Genshin Udugawa, a man who came to know Genpaku through a mutual fascination in the Dutch language. At this time in his old age, Genpaku was looking to adopt a son who could succeed him in taking his home, profession, and legacy of medical service to Japan. Genpaku initially took Genshin in as a student and prospective son to inherit his estate. A young man, Genshin was temperamental and did not heed Genpaku&#x27;s wishes to better his behavior. As such, Genpaku disowned Genshin. A few years passed and Genshin continued his studies of Rangaku and bettered his ambitions, eventually gaining favor of the Udagawas who were friends of Genpaku. With the change in Genshin&#x27;s behavior, Genpaku re-welcomed him as a son, and left him to inherit his estate.

Above all, Genpaku&#x27;s legacy is that of a teacher and physician with the goal to better the health of Japanese citizens through the knowledge of foreign nations. The path of learning Genpaku set his students on fostered a generation of scholars that would come to introduce Western medicine to Japan. In addition to his influence on Japanese medicine, Genpaku&#x27;s Japanese translations of Dutch texts were translated into Chinese. These works were among the first Western medical texts in Chinese.

<doc id="317068" wikidata="Q700310" url="?curid=317068" title="Takasugi Shinsaku">
<text>was a samurai from the Chōshū Domain of Japan who contributed significantly to the Meiji Restoration. He used several aliases to hide his activities from the Tokugawa shogunate.

==Early life==

Takasugi Shinsaku was born in the castle town Hagi, the capital of the Chōshū Domain (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture) as the first son of Takasugi Kochūta, a middle-ranked samurai of the domain and his mother . He would have three younger sisters by the name of , and . He had smallpox at the age of ten, but fortunately he had recovered from it.

Takasugi joined the &quot;Shōka Sonjuku&quot;, the famous private school of Yoshida Shōin. Takasugi devoted himself to the modernization of Chōshū&#x27;s military, and became a favorite student of Yoshida. In 1858, he entered the &quot;Shōheikō&quot; (a military school under direct control of the &quot;shōgun&quot; at Edo). When his teacher was arrested during the Ansei Purge in 1859, Takasugi visited him in jail. Shōin was later executed on 21 November 1859. In December 1859 he returned home by the clan&#x27;s command.

In January 1860, Takasugi married (1845–1922), the second daughter of Yamaguchi retainer and magistrate Inoue Heiemon who was also the friend of his father. Masa was said to be the most beautiful lady in Suō and Nagato provinces. Their marriage was arranged by his parents, with hope that he would take his mind off of his teacher&#x27;s death in 1859 and to settle down with his new bride.

However, in April 1861, Takasugi would leave his home and undertake naval training on the clan&#x27;s warship Heishinmaru, and travelled to Edo. Later in September he went to study at the Tōhoku region, and there he was associated with Sakuma Shōzan and Yokoi Shōnan.

==Foreign experience==
Takasugi, in spite of his young age, was an influential factor within Chōshū as one of the most extreme advocates of a policy of seclusion and expelling the foreigners from Japan.

In spite of Japan&#x27;s policy of national isolation in the Edo period, in 1862 Takasugi was ordered by the domain to go secretly to Shanghai in Great Qing Empire to investigate the state of affairs and the strength of the Western powers. Takasugi&#x27;s visit coincided with the Taiping Rebellion, and he was shocked by the effects of European imperialism even on the Chinese Empire. Takasugi returned to Japan convinced that Japan must strengthen itself to avoid being colonized by the western powers, or to suffer a similar fate as the Qing Empire. This coincided with the growing Sonnō Jōi (&#x27;expel the barbarians and revere the Emperor&#x27;) movement, which attracted certain radical sections of Japan&#x27;s warrior class and court nobility, and Takasugi&#x27;s ideas found ready support in Chōshū and other parts of Japan. Takasugi was implicated in the 31 January 1863 attack on the British legation in Edo.

==Formation of the Shotai and Kiheitai==

Takasugi originated the revolutionary idea of auxiliary irregular militia (&quot;shotai&quot;). Under the feudal system, only the samurai class was allowed to own weapons. Takasugi promoted the recruitment of commoners into new, socially-mixed paramilitary units. In these units, neither recruitment nor promotion depended (at least in theory), on social status. Farmers, merchants, carpenters and even sumo-wrestlers and Buddhist priests were enlisted, although samurai still formed the majority in most of the &quot;Shotai&quot;. Takasugi clearly saw that utilization of the financial wealth of the middle-class merchants and farmers could increase the military strength of the domain, without weakening its finances. Since the leaders of Chōshū were unable - and unwilling - to change the social structure of the domain, limited use of peasants and commoners enabled them to form a new type of military without disturbing the traditional society.

In June 1863, Takasugi himself founded a special &quot;Shotai&quot; unit under his direct command called the &quot;Kiheitai,&quot; which consisted of 300 soldiers (about half of whom were samurai). Later on, while hiding away from assassins, he encountered a shamisen-playing geisha named O-Uno (1843–1909) at a brothel Sakai-ya in Akamaseki, Shimonoseki and went into a relationship with her.

==External and internal crisis==
After Chōshū fired upon Western warships in the Straits of Shimonoseki on 25 June 1863, British, French, Dutch and American naval forces bombarded Shimonoseki, the main port of the Chōshū domain the following summer in what was later called the &quot;Bombardment of Shimonoseki&quot;. Takasugi was put in charge of the defense of Shimonoseki.

An anti-Chōshū coup in Kyoto in the 18 August 1863 threatened to jeopardize Chōshū&#x27;s leading role in national politics, and Chōshū was ousted by a coalition of the Satsuma and Aizu in the imperial court.

Following the on 16 August which involved a conflict between the Chōshū&#x27;s forces &quot;Kiheitai&quot; and &quot;Senkitai&quot; (撰鋒隊) at the Kyohoji temple which left two people dead, Hikosuke Miyagi, who was an inspecting officer of the &quot;Kiheitai&quot;, was forced to commit seppuku at the temple on 27 August. Although Takasugi narrowly escaped the seppuku, he was held liable for the incident and was dismissed as the leader of the &quot;Kiheitai&quot;, only about two months after its formation. The &quot;Kiheitai&quot; was taken over by Kawakami Yaichi and Taki Yataro, followed by Akane Taketo and Yamagata Aritomo on October.

In February 1864, Takasugi tried to dissuade Kijima Matabei from his plan to fight Satsuma and Aizu in Kyoto, but failed and then left the domain to hide in Kyoto himself. He was persuaded by Katsura Kogorō to return, but upon arrival he was put in Noyama-Goku Prison for the charge of leaving the domain. He was later released in July and ordered to confine himself at home.

In September 1864, a fleet of warships of British, French, Dutch and American naval forces attacked Shimonoseki again and occupied the gun battery there. This was followed by the landing of French marines. Their fighting against Chōshū units demonstrated the inferiority of traditional Japanese troops against a Western army, and convinced the leaders of the domain of the absolute necessity for a thorough military reform. Chōshū soon had no choice but to call on Takasugi again. Shinsaku was then forgiven and put in charge of peace negotiations. The Chōshū domain&#x27;s administration called on Takasugi not only to carry out this reform as ‘Director of Military Affairs’, but he - only 25 years of age - was also entrusted with negotiating peace with the four Western powers.

In view of the humiliation of Chōshū forces against the Western powers, Takasugi had come to the realization that direct confrontation with the foreigners was not an option. Instead, Japan had to learn military tactics, techniques and technologies from the West. Takasugi reorganized his &quot;Kiheitai&quot; militia into a rifle-unit with the latest modern rifles, and introduced training in Western strategy and tactics. Moreover, Takasugi used his influence with the Sonnô Jôi-movement to promote a more a conciliatory policy towards the West and thus, the ‘movement to expel the barbarians and revere the Emperor’ evolved into an anti-&quot;Bakufu&quot; movement with the overthrow of the Tokugawa bakufu as a necessary means to strengthen Japan against the foreigners.

Weakened by the punitive attack by the Western powers, Chōshū was unable to withstand the expedition mounted by the &quot;Bakufu&quot; in autumn 1864 in retaliation for previous Chōshū attempts to seize control of Kyoto. At first, conservative forces, which favored conciliation with the &quot;Bakufu&quot; in order to secure the domain, were dominant in Chōshū politics, and Takasugi and some of his compatriots had to leave the domain to avoid renewed imprisonment. Takasugi, with only about a dozen followers, including future political leaders Yamagata Aritomo, Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru, gathered in Kokura in Kyūshū and prepared an attack on the conservative forces in Chōshū. The subsequent Chōshū civil war began on 13 January 1865.

Takasugi played a major role in this civil war and his former &quot;Kiheitai&quot; militia proved its superiority over old-fashioned samurai forces. With a series of quick strikes and the support of Katsura Kogorō, Takasugi achieved victory by March 1865. He became one of the main arbiters of the Chōshū domain&#x27;s policy and continued to act as the domain&#x27;s expert on Western military science, devoting his efforts to importing arms and raising troops. These reforms proved to be successful when Chōshū was victorious on four fronts against the &quot;Bakufu&#x27;s&quot; Second Chōshū expedition on 7 June 1866, with the &quot;Kiheitai&quot; itself securing victory on two fronts. Takasugi&#x27;s efforts had made a small-scale &#x27;nation in arms&#x27; out of Chōshū, giving it a military strength out of proportion to its relatively small size. With its victory over the Tokugawa forces, the military power of the &quot;Bakufu&quot; was discredited, and traditionally rival domains decided to join forces with Chōshū in the subsequent battles which eventually led to the end of the Tokugawa bakufu and the start of the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

==Death==
Takasugi did not live to see this success as his tuberculosis got worse in October 1866, after which he was moved to a residence of the bar manager Hayashi Sankuro. His mistress O-Uno and the Buddhist nun and poet Nomura Bōtō nursed him there.

Around February 1867, his wife Masa and their three year-old son (aka Takasugi Umenoshin) (1864–1913) arrived from Hagi to visit him. Due to the presence of his wife and not wishing to sully Takasugi&#x27;s name, O-Uno left and became a Buddhist nun under the name of Tani Baisho, but was later summoned back by Masa to look after him. However in March 1867, Takasugi&#x27;s illness worsened yet again, Masa and Tōichi were summoned back to Hagi, while Baisho and Nomura stayed with him until his death on 17 May 1867.


Under his will, Takasugi was buried near the &quot;Kiheitai&quot;&#x27;s camp at the Mt. Kiyomizu in Yoshida. Only a year later, Takasugi&#x27;s dream of overthrowing the Tokugawa Shogunate, which found obvious manifestation in his nickname , was fulfilled with the Meiji Restoration. Before leaving for Europe in 1869, Yamagata Aritomo presented his thatched hut named Murin-an (無鄰菴) which is also at Mt. Kiyomizu to Takasugi&#x27;s former mistress and nun Baisho to dwell in and to look after his grave. Kido Takayoshi (formerly Katsura Kogorō) and his wife Matsuko would later take his young son Tōichi under their wings in 1871.

In 1884, Takasugi&#x27;s friends and comrades whom included Yamagata Aritomo, Yamada Akiyoshi, Itō Hirobumi, and Inoue Kaoru among others, raised funds to have a hermitage Tōgyō-an (東行庵), named after Takasugi&#x27;s nickname, built close to his gravesite, there Tani Baisho stayed and looked after his grave until her death in 1909. The grave itself was designated a National Historic Monument in 1934. 

==Legacy==
Takasugi Shinsaku, a central figure of the early Meiji Restoration, is as well known for his military talents as he is for his skills as a politician. However, dying at the young age of 28, Takasugi was not to become one of Japan&#x27;s famous leaders in the subsequent Meiji era. In his hometown, the castle town Hagi, Yamaguchi in south-western Japan - he is still remembered as a mystical and energetic hero, who put all his efforts into opening the way to modernization, westernization and reforms, not only in military matters but in political and social matters as well.

<doc id="317069" wikidata="Q276404" url="?curid=317069" title="Takeda Shingen">
<text>was daimyo of Kai Province during the Sengoku period of Japan. Known as &quot;the Tiger of Kai&quot;, he was one of the most powerful daimyo of the late Sengoku period, and credited with exceptional military prestige. Shingen was based in a poor area with little arable land and no access to the sea, but he became one of Japan&#x27;s leading daimyo. His skills are highly esteemed and on par with Mōri Motonari.

==Name==

Shingen was called &quot;Tarō&quot; (a commonly used pet name for the eldest son of a Japanese family) or Katsuchiyo (勝千代) during his childhood. After his &quot;genpuku&quot; (coming of age ceremony), he was given the formal name Harunobu (晴信), which included a character from the name of Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate. It was a common practice in feudal Japan for a higher-ranking samurai to bestow a character from his own name to his inferiors as a symbol of recognition. From the local lord&#x27;s perspective, it was an honour to receive a character from the shogunate, although the authority of the latter had greatly degenerated in the mid-16th century.

Both the Ashikaga and the Takeda clans descended from the Minamoto clan. Technically, Harunobu, as well as his forefathers, had borne the surname of Minamoto. Therefore, Harunobu is referred to as &quot;Minamoto no Harunobu&quot; (源 晴信) in official records kept by the Imperial Court when he was conferred the official title of &quot;Daizen Daibu&quot; (大膳大夫, Master of the Palace Table). The Imperial Court had maintained a system of &quot;ritsuryō&quot; that was parallel to the shogunate apparatus.

In February 1559 Harunobu chose to live a &quot;pabbajja&quot; life as a Buddhist novitiate and received a dharma name, Shingen (信玄), from his Buddhist master. The kanji of &quot;Shingen&quot; can also be pronounced as &quot;Nobuharu&quot;, which is the inversion of his official name, Harunobu. In ancient times, such religious names of recognized Japanese aristocrats used the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; Chinese-style pronunciation, instead of &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, the indigenous Japanese pronunciation. Although widely known by his dharma name, Takeda Shingen&#x27;s formal name remained Harunobu throughout the rest of his life.

Shingen is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Tiger of Kai&quot; (甲斐の虎) for his martial prowess on the battlefield. His primary rival, Uesugi Kenshin (上杉謙信), was often called &quot;The Dragon of Echigo&quot; (越後の龍) or &quot;The Tiger of Echigo&quot; (越後の虎). They fought several times at Kawanakajima.

==Early life and rise==
Takeda Shingen was the first-born son of Takeda Nobutora (武田信虎), leader of the Takeda clan, and daimyo of the province of Kai. He had been an accomplished poet in his youth. He assisted his father with the older relatives and vassals of the Takeda clan, and became a valuable addition to the clan at a fairly young age. In 1536, at the age of 15, he was instrumental in helping his father win the Battle of Un no Kuchi.

At some point in his life after his &quot;coming of age&quot; ceremony, the young man decided to rebel against his father, Takeda Nobutora. He succeeded in 1540, successfully taking control of the clan. Events regarding this change of leadership are not entirely clear, but it is thought that Nobutora had planned to name his second son, Nobushige, as his heir instead of Shingen. The result was a miserable retirement that was forced upon him by Shingen and his supporters: he was sent to Suruga Province, on the southern border of Kai, to be kept in custody under the scrutiny of the Imagawa clan, led by his son-in-law Imagawa Yoshimoto (今川義元), the daimyo of Suruga. For their help in this bloodless coup, an alliance was formed between the Imagawa and the Takeda clans.

==Takeda campaign==
===Shinano campaign===
Shingen&#x27;s first act was to gain a hold of the area around him. His goal was to conquer Shinano Province. A number of the major warlords in the Shinano region marched on the border of Kai Province, hoping to neutralize the power of the still-young Shingen before he had a chance to expand into their lands. However, planning to beat him down at Fuchu (where word had it Shingen was gathering his forces for a stand), they were unprepared when Takeda forces suddenly came down upon them at the Battle of Sezawa. Taking advantage of their confusion, Shingen was able to win a quick victory, which set the stage for his drive into Shinano lands that same year and his successful Siege of Uehara. The young warlord made considerable advances into the region, conquering the Suwa clan&#x27;s headquarters in the Siege of Kuwabara, before moving into central Shinano with the defeat of both Tozawa Yorichika and Takato Yoritsugu in the Siege of Fukuyo and Battle of Ankokuji. In 1543, he captured Nagakubo Castle, Kojinyama Castle in 1544, and then Takatō Castle and Ryūgasaki Castle in 1545. In 1546 he took Uchiyama Castle and won the Battle of Odaihara. In 1547, he took Shika Castle.

In 1548, Shingen defeated Ogasawara Nagatoki in the Battle of Shiojiritoge and then took Fukashi Castle in 1550. However, the warlord was checked at Uedahara by Murakami Yoshikiyo, losing two of his generals in a heated battle which Murakami won. Shingen managed to avenge this loss and the Murakami clan was eventually defeated in the sieges of Toishi. Murakami fled the region, eventually coming to plead for help from the Province of Echigo.

In 1553, he captured Katsurao, Wada, Takashima and Fukuda castles. In 1554 he took Fukushima, Kannomine, Matsuo and Yoshioka castles.

===Conflict with Uesugi===

After conquering Shinano Province, Shingen faced another rival, Uesugi Kenshin of Echigo Province. The feud between them became legendary, and they faced each other on the battlefield five times in the Battles of Kawanakajima.

These battles were generally confined to controlled skirmishes, neither &quot;daimyō&quot; willing to devote himself entirely to a single all-out attempt. The conflict between the two that had the fiercest fighting, and might have decided victory or defeat for one side or the other, was the fourth battle, during which the famous tale arose of Uesugi Kenshin&#x27;s forces clearing a path through the Takeda troops and Kenshin engaging Shingen in single combat. The tale has Kenshin attacking Shingen with his sword while Shingen defends with his iron war fan or tessen. Both lords lost many men in this fight, and Shingen in particular lost two of his main generals, Yamamoto Kansuke and his younger brother Takeda Nobushige.

After the fourth battle of Kawanakajima, the Takeda clan suffered two internal setbacks. Shingen uncovered two plots on his life, the first from his cousin Suwa Shigemasa (whom he ordered to commit seppuku), and the second, a few years later, from his own son Takeda Yoshinobu (武田義信). His son was confined to the Toko-ji temple, where he died two years later; it is not known whether his death was natural or ordered by his father. After this incident, Shingen designated his fourth son, Takeda Katsuyori (武田勝頼), as the acting leader of the clan after himself until Katsuyori&#x27;s son came of age.

===Kōzuke campaign===
In 1563, Shingen allied with Hōjō Ujiyasu, and helped Ujiyasu capture Matsuyama Castle in Musashi Province. In 1565, Shingen then took Kuragano Castle and Minowa Castle in Kōzuke province.

In 1571, Uesugi Kenshin had advanced to the province of Kozuke and attacked the satellite castle of Shingen&#x27;s, Ishikura Castle. Both forces met each other in the Battle of Tonegawa, but eventually disengaged after a well-fought fight.

===Suruga campaign===
The death of Takeda Yoshinobu is believed to have much to do with the change in Shingen&#x27;s policy towards the Imagawa clan. After Imagawa Yoshimoto&#x27;s death in a Battle of Okehazama against Oda Nobunaga in 1560, Shingen made an alliance with the Oda and Tokugawa clan, and started to plan an invasion of Suruga Province, a territory now controlled by Yoshimoto&#x27;s son, Ujizane. Yoshinobu, however, had strongly opposed such a plan because his wife was the daughter of Yoshimoto. By 1567, nonetheless, after Shingen had successfully kept the forces led by Uesugi Kenshin out of the northern boundaries of Shinano Province, taken over a strategically important castle in western Kōzuke, and suppressed internal objection to his plans to take advantage of the weakened Imagawa clan, he was ready to carry out his planned Suruga invasion. Shingen and Tokugawa Ieyasu &quot;came to terms&quot; and occupied the &quot;former Imagawa territory.&quot; They both fought against Yoshimoto&#x27;s heir, Imagawa Ujizane.

During this time Shingen also ordered the damming project of the Fuji River, which was one of the major domestic activities of the time.

===Predicament===
The Suruga invasion angered Hojo Ujiyasu. After confirming that, the Takeda and Hojo alliance had collapsed, Tokugawa Ieyasu gave up on Takeda, and approached Uesugi and Hojo. As a consequence, Shingen was in a difficult situation with enemies on three sides. In such a predicament, Shingen asked his ally Oda Nobunaga for help. Nobunaga soothed Ieyasu and mediated reconciliation between Takeda and Uesugi. Thanks to Nobunaga&#x27;s efforts, Shingen was able to escape from the predicament.

===Conflict with Hojo===

In 1568, as a response to Hōjō clan intervention in his invasion of Suruga Province, Shingen broke the alliance with the Hōjō, and came into Musashi Province from his home province of Kai, attacking Takiyama Castle. He then moved against the Hojo by attacking Hachigata Castle, then engaged in the Siege of Odawara (1569). He burned Odawara Castle town, then successfully withdrew after Hōjō Ujiteru and Hōjō Ujikuni failed to stop him in the Battle of Mimasetoge.

After defeating the intervention forces commanded by Hōjō Ujimasa of Sagami Province, Shingen finally secured the Suruga Province, formerly base of the prestigious Imagawa clan, as a Takeda asset in 1569.

At this point, Shingen now had Kai Province, Shinano Province, the western part of Kōzuke Province, Musashi Province and Suruga Province.

===Conflict with Oda–Tokugawa alliance===

By the time Takeda Shingen was 49 years old, he was the only &quot;daimyō&quot; with the necessary power and tactical skill to stop Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s rush to rule Japan.

In 1572, upon securing Takeda control over Suruga, northern Shinano, and western Kōzuke, Shingen advanced to Totomi Province, and took Oda&#x27;s Iwamura Castle, which caused the Takeda–Oda relationship to decline. Later, Shingen engaged Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s forces and captured Tokugawa&#x27;s Futamata Castle.

In early 1573, Shingen decided to make a drive for Kyoto at the urgings of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki. While seeking a route from Kōfu to Kyoto, Shingen moved to challenge the Oda–Tokugawa alliance in the Battle of Mikatagahara, one of the most famous battles of Takeda Shingen&#x27;s campaigns, and one of the best demonstrations of his cavalry-based tactics. It was also one of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s worst defeats, and complete disaster was only narrowly averted. Shingen stopped his advance temporarily due to outside influences, which allowed the Tokugawa clan to prepare for battle again. In mid 1573, he led a formidable force of over 30,000 into Tokugawa territories in Tōtōmi, Mikawa, and Mino provinces.

==Death==

Once he entered Mikawa Province in February 1573, Shingen besieged Noda Castle, but then died in his siege camp at the age of 51. The exact circumstances surrounding his death are unknown. Some accounts say he succumbed to an old war wound, some say a sniper had wounded him earlier, and others that he died of pneumonia. He was buried at Erin-ji temple in what is now Kōshū, Yamanashi.

After Shingen&#x27;s death, Takeda Katsuyori became the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Takeda clan. Katsuyori was ambitious and wanted to continue his father&#x27;s legacy. He moved to take Tokugawa forts. However, an allied force of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga dealt a crushing blow to the Takeda in the Battle of Nagashino, when Nobunaga&#x27;s matchlock-armed infantry destroyed the Takeda cavalry. Nobunaga and Ieyasu seized the opportunity to defeat the weakened Takeda clan led by Takeda Katsuyori. Later, in the Battle of Tenmokuzan, Katsuyori committed suicide after the battle and the Takeda clan never recovered.

==Legacy==
Upon Takeda Shingen&#x27;s death, Uesugi Kenshin reportedly wept at the loss of one of his strongest and most deeply-respected rivals. However, historian Kazuto Hongō viewed that despite the advantage of advanced military doctrines and administration systems established by Shingen, his efforts failed to prosper the Takeda clan themselves. Hongō stressed the failure of Takeda clan during Shingen period to build a war economy, as he examines that the 20 years of effort of Shingen conquest to subjugate Shinano province, in complement with his series of exhausting engagements against his rival Kenshin, he only managed to secure the territories which only yield gross annual rice production of 600,000 koku as revenue at most, which translates this means the optimal military mobilization of Takeda clan were at maximum only 20,000 soldiers for each campaign. In contrast with Oda Nobunaga provinces, where his possession of Mino province was already could produce at least 650,000 Koku annually, which combined with his later territories of Mino also viewed as rich province that the gross estimation of Nobunaga koku production could mean he can always utilize the rations to mobilize army more or less twice than Shingen could afford. Furthermore, the condition of Takeda clan which only manage to control landlocked provinces also contrasted with Nobunaga access for the rich and prosperous Sakai port city, which means Nobunaga could afford military technologies and exotic supplies for his war machine that far better than Shingen.

One of the most lasting tributes to Shingen&#x27;s prowess was that of Tokugawa Ieyasu himself, who is known to have borrowed heavily from the old Takeda leader&#x27;s governmental and military innovations after he had taken leadership of Kai Province during Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s rise to power. There are two most notable moments of the incorporation of the Takeda clan elements into the Tokugawa clan regime. The first was during the Tenshō-Jingo War between Ieyasu against the Hōjō clan on the aftermath of the death of Oda Nobunaga. During that moment, Ieyasu has hid many of Takeda clan followers from Nobunaga&#x27;s wrath who declared the massacre against them. Those Takeda clan vassals immediately declared their allegiance to Ieyasu when the Hōjō and Uesugi clan invaded Kai and Shinano, where at least 800 of former Takeda clan retainers joined the ranks of Tokugawa army during the war and fought the Hōjō. Then furthermore, on the aftermath of the war, Ieyasu immediately organized a kishōmon(blood oath) ceremony with the former vassals of Takeda clan to declare their loyalty to the Tokugawa clan, which resulted in:

* 70 former Takeda samurai from Tsuchiya clan under the command of Ii Naomasa (another source mentioned that total of 120 Takeda samurai warriors.
* 11 former Takeda samurai from Komai clan led by Komai Masanao under the command of Sakakibara Yasumasa.
* 60 former Takeda samurai of Asari clan led by Asari Masatane under the command of Honda Tadakatsu.
* Huge portions of Takeda clans vassals under the direct control of Ieyasu himself, including clans which led by Yoda Nobushige. Among those who were assigned as Hatamoto, or direct vassal of Ieyasu, they were allowed to retain their positions, and even increased the domains revenue they controlled particularly from the new territories which the Tokugawa clan conquered. This apparent from the Saegusa clan, where his the son of the clan leader, Saegusa Masayoshi, retain his, while his father Saegusa Torayoshi appointed as one of four magistrate in the Tokugawa clan.

Historian Masaru Hirayama argued, the outcome of this war which involved the absorption of Takeda retainers into Tokugawa ranks was not only just factional conflict in the eastern province, but it determined the unification of Japan in the future, as it pushed Tokugawa Ieyasu into the key position of Toyotomi government.

The second occasion of the further incorporation of Takeda clan&#x27;s vassals occurred on November 13, 1585, when Ishikawa Kazumasa defected from Ieyasu to Hideyoshi. This caused Ieyasu to undertake major reforms of the structures of Tokugawa clan military government and chose the bureaucratic administrations and military doctrines practiced by Shingen as his core for his statecraft. At first, Ieyasu ordered Torii Mototada, who served as the county magistrate of Kai, to collect military laws, weapons, and military equipment from the time of Takeda Shingen and bring them to Hamamatsu Castle. Later, he also appointed two former Takeda vassals, Naruse Masakazu and Okabe Masatsuna, as magistrates under authority of Ii Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu, while he also ordered all of former Takeda vassals who now serve him to impart any military doctrines and structures they knew during their service under Takeda clan., and lastly, he ordered the three of his prime generals, the so-called &quot;Tokugawa Four Heavenly Kings,&quot; Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and Sakakibara Yasumasa, to serve as supreme commander of this new military regiments.

Those statecrafting doctrine which Ieyasu practiced and learned from Shingen&#x27;s former vassals greatly benefitted him in the long run, as being proven on the future, such as when Ieyasu transferring his powerbase to Kantō region in 1590, as he established new offices such as the Hachiōji sen&#x27;nin-dōshin, which formed from patchwork memberships from 9 small clans of Takeda retainers. This group will continue to serve the Tokugawa clan faithfully as defender of Kai province during this period in service of Ieyasu. The Hachiōji sen&#x27;nin-dōshin served the Tokugawa clan even after Ieyasu&#x27;s death, until their disbandment during Meiji Restoration in 1868.

In conclusion, Historian such as Michifumi Isoda opined that one factor why the Tokugawa clan&#x27;s could conquer Japan was due to the incorporation of former Takeda clan&#x27;s vassals into the service of Ieyasu&#x27;s military regime particularly under the command of his general Ii Naomasa. While professor Watanabe Daimon also similarly stated that The Kai province samurai greatly influenced Ieyasu&#x27;s domination of Japan. According to an anecdote from “Meisho Genkoroku” (&quot;Collection of words and deeds of great commanders in Japanese history&quot;), when Nobunaga sent a head of Takeda Katsuyori to Ieyasu, Ieyasu remarked in the front of the former Takeda clan followers his head that although Katsuyori was a biological son of Shingen, but that he was the &quot;spiritual successor&quot; of Shingen.

=== Retainers ===
During the Edo period, 24 retainers who served under Shingen were chosen as a popular topic for ukiyo-e and bunraku. The names vary from work to work and the following list is the widely agreed version of retainers. They had not all worked together, as some had died before others served, but they were noted for their exceptional contributions to Shingen and the Takeda clan.
Of his retainers, Kōsaka Masanobu stands out as being one of Shingen&#x27;s better known beloveds, in the style of the Japanese shudō tradition. The two entered into the relationship when Shingen was 22 and Masanobu 16. The love pact signed by the two, in Tokyo University&#x27;s Historical Archive, documents Shingen&#x27;s pledge that he was not involved in, nor had any intentions of entering into, a sexual relationship with a certain other retainer, and asserts that &quot;since I want to be intimate with you&quot; he will in no way harm the boy, and calls upon the gods to be his guarantors.

<text>Rena Marlette Lesnar (&#x27;Greek, formerlyMero; born August 8, 1967), better known asSable, is an American retired model, actress, and professional wrestler. She is best known for her tenures in World Wrestling Entertainment from 1996 to 1999 and from 2003 to 2004. As Sable, she gained immense popularity during the Attitude Era. After feuding with Luna Vachon, and Jacqueline, Sable became the second WWF Women&#x27;s Champion after the title was reinstated into the company. After leaving the company in 1999, she filed a $110 million lawsuit against the company, citing allegations of sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions.

In 2003, she returned to WWE and was put into a feud with Torrie Wilson, and another storyline as Vince McMahon&#x27;s mistress. In 2004, she left the company to spend more time with her family. Outside wrestling, she is considered to be a sex symbol and has been featured on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; three times. The April 1999 issue of the magazine with her on the cover was one of the highest selling issues in &quot;Playboy&quot; history. She has guest starred on several television series, including &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;Corky Romano&quot;.

== Early life ==
Rena Greek was born in Jacksonville, Florida. She was active in her youth and was interested in activities such as gymnastics, horseback riding, and softball. After winning her first beauty pageant when she was twelve, she eventually became a model in 1990, working with companies such as L&#x27;Oréal, Pepsi, and Guess?.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== World Wrestling Federation (1996-1999) ===

==== Debut and feud with Marc Mero (1996–1998) ====
She made her World Wrestling Federation debut as Sable at WrestleMania XII in March 1996, escorting Hunter Hearst Helmsley to the ring as he took on the returning Ultimate Warrior. Sable&#x27;s first major angle involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at WrestleMania XII as &quot;Wildman&quot; Marc Mero. The storyline started when Marc Mero witnessed Sable being mistreated by Helmsley backstage, so Mero attacked Helmsley and took Sable as his manager. She remained Mero&#x27;s manager until his injury in February 1997, with Sable becoming wildly popular on her own whilst Mero was off TV. When Marc Mero returned in October 1997, his gimmick transitioned. Dubbing himself &quot;Marvelous&quot; Marc Mero, a jealous Mero refused to let Sable get any of the spotlight, and mistreated her. The duo entered into a feud with Luna Vachon and The Artist Formerly Known as Goldust, which climaxed in a match at WrestleMania XIV in March 1998. Sable delivered a superkick to Goldust and executed a &quot;Sable Bomb&quot;, a release powerbomb, on Luna. She also delivered a TKO and pinned Luna to finish the match, with the crowd chanting Sable&#x27;s name in the background. At the following pay-per-view event, Unforgiven in April 1998, Sable lost to Luna in an Evening Gown match after being distracted by Marc Mero.

After Marc&#x27;s interference at Unforgiven, Sable came to the ring and challenged Marc to a match. Sable then kicked him in the groin and delivered a Sable Bomb to get revenge. Sable eventually broke away from &quot;Marvelous&quot; Marc Mero, who debuted Jacqueline as his new manager, resulting in a storyline feud between the two women. The two met in a bikini contest in July 1998 at Fully Loaded. Sable, only wearing impressions of hands painted on her exposed breasts, won the contest after receiving the most cheers from the audience. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot; however, Vince McMahon disqualified Sable from the previous night&#x27;s contest since she did not actually wear a bikini, and the trophy was then awarded to Jacqueline. In response, Sable gave McMahon the double finger. At SummerSlam, Sable and her mystery partner, federation newcomer Edge, defeated Marc Mero and Jacqueline in a mixed tag team match.

==== Women&#x27;s Champion (1998–1999) ====

Sable and Jacqueline faced off for the newly reinstated WWF Women&#x27;s Title on the edition of September 21, 1998, of &quot;Raw&quot;. Jacqueline claimed the title after Marc Mero interfered. On November 15, 1998, at Survivor Series, she dropped the title to Sable, who won after powerbombing both Marc and Jacqueline during the match. During this time, Rena appeared on an episode of the USA Network show &quot;Pacific Blue&quot;. Sable then briefly entered a storyline where she was forced to play a subservient role to Vince and Shane McMahon, but the storyline was cut short.

In December 1998, as part of a new storyline, Sable was attacked by a masked villainess named Spider Lady, who turned out to be Luna Vachon. Sable defeated Luna in a Strap match at the Royal Rumble after an assist from a planted female Sable fan, WWF newcomer Tori. Tori&#x27;s debut signified a change in Sable&#x27;s persona. After the Rumble, Sable was the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, one of the highest selling issues of &quot;Playboy&quot; ever. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned heel by &quot;going Hollywood&quot; and having an inflated ego. She debuted a new catchphrase: &quot;This is for all the women who want to be me and all the men who come to see me&quot; and a dance move called &quot;the grind.&quot; Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, leading to a feud and a match at WrestleMania XV. During the contest, Nicole Bass debuted as Sable&#x27;s bodyguard and helped her win the match. Sable also feuded with Luna Vachon, who had turned face.

Sable went on with Bass making Bass do all of her dirty work. Sable continued to hold the championship for almost six months, but on May 10, 1999, Debra won the Women&#x27;s Championship from Sable in an Evening Gown match. Normally in an Evening Gown match, the winner is the woman who forcibly removes her opponent&#x27;s dress, which Sable did. As part of the storyline, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, however, ruled that the woman who had lost her dress was the winner, making Debra the new Women&#x27;s Champion. Off-screen, Sable was in a dispute with the WWF, which is why she was stripped of the title on-screen. Sable at this time was also very unpopular backstage, to the extent that Sean Waltman has since admitted to playing a nasty practical joke on her last day with the WWF.

=== Post–WWF (1999–2002) ===
In June 1999, Sable quit the WWF and filed a $110 million lawsuit against the company, citing allegations of sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions. She claims to have filed the lawsuit after refusing to go topless. During the lawsuit, Vince McMahon counter-sued her over control of the stagename &quot;Sable&quot;. Sable reduced the amount she was seeking in damages, and they eventually settled out of court in August 1999. Sable used her real name for her appearance in the September 1999 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. She was the first woman in history to be given two &quot;Playboy&quot; covers in the same year. After her WWF exit, she made an on-camera appearance as an audience member on World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on June 14, 1999.

During this time, she made appearances on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. She also made appearances on television shows such as &quot;Relic Hunter&quot; and &quot;First Wave&quot; and in the films &quot;Corky Romano&quot; as a female bouncer and &quot;Ariana&#x27;s Quest&quot;. She released her autobiography, entitled &quot;Undefeated&quot; in August 2000. She also released a comic book entitled &quot;The 10th Muse&quot; starring herself as a superhero. In May 2001, she was given an advice column on CompuServe. On November 13 and 14, 2001, she appeared as the on-camera &quot;CEO&quot; of the newly formed Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF), but these were her only appearances with the company.

=== Return to World Wrestling Entertainment (2003-2004) ===

==== Relationship with Vince McMahon (2003) ====

Rena Mero returned to the WWF, which is now known as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on April 3, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, reprising her role as Sable. Sable continued portraying a villainess and spent several months in a storyline with new &quot;Playboy&quot; cover girl Torrie Wilson. During their angle, the evil Sable followed Wilson down to her matches, talked with her backstage, and on one occasion, she left Wilson in a tag match alone to fend for herself. Sable eventually challenged Wilson to a showdown bikini contest at Judgment Day. After Sable got the bigger applause, Wilson removed her underwear to reveal an even smaller bikini underneath, and Special Guest Referee Tazz declared Wilson the winner. After the match, Wilson went up to Sable and kissed her before exiting the ring. Sable then had an altercation with the guest judge Tazz, dumping water on him on the following edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, as a means of gaining revenge for declaring Wilson the winner.

Sable then feuded with Stephanie McMahon in a storyline in which she was Vince McMahon&#x27;s mistress. Vince appointed Sable as Stephanie&#x27;s personal assistant against Stephanie&#x27;s will, sparking the feud between the duo. During the feud, they competed in several catfights, a food fight, a parking lot brawl in which Sable&#x27;s bra was ripped off, revealing both her breasts on live television, and a match in which Sable smacked a clipboard over Stephanie&#x27;s head. At Vengeance, Sable defeated Stephanie after interference by her new ally, A-Train. At SummerSlam, Sable accompanied A-Train in his match against The Undertaker, which he lost. After the match, The Undertaker held Sable so that Stephanie could use a Spear attack on her. After SummerSlam, Vince and Sable focused on getting rid of Stephanie for good, so Vince made an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at No Mercy. During the match, Sable slapped Stephanie and was involved in a scuffle with Linda McMahon.

==== Various storylines (2004) ====
Sable briefly became a face again when she appeared on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine (March 2004 issue) for the third time in her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in &quot;Playboy&quot; together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with &quot;Raw&quot; divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, even though all four women were faces at the time. The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a lingerie match. Sable and Wilson were victorious. The change was rumored to have occurred because Sable had suffered damage to her breast implants while weightlifting.

Following WrestleMania XX, Sable quickly turned heel again and engaged in another short feud with Torrie Wilson. The feud culminated at The Great American Bash, where Sable defeated Wilson despite the referee not noticing that one of Wilson&#x27;s shoulders were not down. On the edition of July 1 of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Sable was defeated by Wilson in a rematch. In the July 22, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; she competed in a Fatal-4-Way lingerie match, against Wilson, Dawn Marie, and Miss Jackie; but Kurt Angle (in his kayfabe role as WWE’s General Manager) fired all four of them, however all four were re-signed after Angle was fired as General Manager of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; by Vince McMahon. Sable&#x27;s final appearance in WWE was on the August 5, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when she, Marie, and Wilson accompanied Eddie Guerrero to the ring in his lowrider, mocking Angle, turning face again. On August 10, 2004, WWE&#x27;s official website announced that Sable and WWE had parted ways, this time on good terms. Lesnar claimed that she left the company to spend more time with her family.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2006–2007) ===
She made her debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling on January 4, 2006, at Toukon Shidou Chapter 1, along with Brock Lesnar as special guests, and continued to accompany Lesnar until late June 2007. Sable and Lesnar later departed from the company after Lesnar battled WWE in a lawsuit.

== Other media ==
=== Playboy and video games ===
Sable made her video game debut in the WWE game &quot;WWF Attitude&quot;, and appears in &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot; and &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw&quot;. She also appeared in the April 1999, September 1999, and March 2004 issues of &quot;Playboy&quot;, the latter with Torrie Wilson.

<doc id="317071" wikidata="Q521070" url="?curid=317071" title="Tanuma Okitsugu">
<text> (September 11, 1719 – August 25, 1788) was a chamberlain (&quot;sobashū&quot;) and a senior counselor (&quot;rōjū&quot;) to the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieharu of the Tokugawa Shogunate, in the Edo period of Japan. Tanuma and his son exercised tremendous power, especially in the last 14 years of shogun Ieharu&#x27;s reign. He is known for the economic reforms of the Tenmei era and rampant corruption. He was also a &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Sagara Domain. Tanuma used the title Tonomo-no-kami.

Tanuma&#x27;s reforms aimed to rectify the systemic problems in Japan&#x27;s economy, particularly the trade imbalance between the provinces (&quot;han&quot;) and the shogunal areas (&quot;tenryō&quot;) of Japan. The previous shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, sought to rectify the shogunate&#x27;s economic problems by frugality and a focus on agriculture. Instead, Tanuma debased currency, sold monopoly rights to dealers, and taxed merchant guilds. To stem unfavorable balances of trade and bullion outflow, he took steps to increase foreign exports and set export quotas for Akita copper mines (copper being the primary coinage metal during that period), despite higher domestic prices. Tanuma&#x27;s administration granted monopoly patents for numerous products, including iron, brass, sulfur, ginseng and lamp oil. Large investments were made into the massive drainage program to increase the agricultural land. 

Despite Tanuma&#x27;s intentions to serve the public good, he was deeply corrupt and exacerbated corruption in government. Several years of crop failures from 1783 to 1787, resulting from drought followed by floods, led to famine and frequent riots.

In Tenmei 4 (1784), Okitsugu&#x27;s son, the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; (junior counselor) , was assassinated inside Edo Castle. Okitomo was killed in front of his father as both were returning to their &quot;norimono&quot; after a meeting of the Counselors of State had broken up. Okitomo was killed by Sano Masakoto, a &quot;hatamoto&quot;. The involvement of senior figures in the &quot;bakufu&quot; was suspected, but only the assassin himself was punished.

The famine led to a spike in a number of protests and peasant rebellions, culminating in the Edo riots of 1787. Traditionalist opponents of the reform interpreted it as the &quot;voice of Heaven&quot; being followed by the &quot;voice of the people&quot;. With the assassination of his son and the death of his patron Tokugawa Ieharu, Tanuma fell from power. The result was that the reforms and the relaxation of the strictures of &quot;sakoku&quot; were blocked.

<doc id="317072" wikidata="Q901014" url="?curid=317072" title="Waitangi Tribunal">
<text>The Waitangi Tribunal (Māori: &quot;Te Rōpū Whakamana i te Tiriti o Waitangi&quot;) is a New Zealand permanent commission of inquiry established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. It is charged with investigating and making recommendations on claims brought by Māori relating to actions or omissions of the Crown, in the period largely since 1840, that breach the promises made in the Treaty of Waitangi. The Tribunal is not a court of law; therefore, the Tribunal&#x27;s recommendations and findings are not binding on the Crown. They are sometimes not acted on, for instance in the foreshore and seabed dispute.

The inquiry process contributes to the resolution of Treaty claims and to the reconciliation of outstanding issues between Māori and Pākehā. In 2014, the Tribunal found that Ngāpuhi rangatira did not give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.

==History==
In 1975, protests from indigenous peoples about unresolved Treaty of Waitangi grievances had been increasing for some time, and the Tribunal was set up to provide a legal process for the investigation of those grievances. Matiu Rata, a Minister of Māori Affairs in the early 1970s, took a leading role in the Tribunal&#x27;s creation.

Originally the Tribunal could investigate grievances only since 1975, but in 1985, a law change meant the Tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction was extended back to 1840, the date of the Waitangi Treaty. The subsequent findings of many Treaty breaches by the Crown in various inquiries led to a public backlash against the Tribunal. The Tribunal has often been a political issue in the 1990s and 2000s.

Originally a Tribunal investigation and report was a prerequisite for a Treaty settlement, but in 1999, to speed up settlements, parliament changed the process so that claimants could go straight to settlement with the Office of Treaty Settlements without engaging in the Tribunal process. This was an increasingly popular short-cut to settlement in the face of the slow Tribunal process. The deadline for submitting historical claims was 1 September 2008, but contemporary claims can still be filed.

In late October 2024, the Government appointed retired cabinet minister Richard Prebble and senior insurer Ken Williamson to the Tribunal. Kevin Prime was reappointed for a second term. Labour Member of Parliament Willie Jackson objected to Prebble&#x27;s appointment, citing his alignment with the ACT Party&#x27;s policies towards Māori including the controversial Treaty Principles Bill.

On 17 January 2025, Minister for Māori Development Tama Potaka announced an overhaul of the Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s membership. He appointed eight new members including Rangitāne Tū Mai Rā Trust general manager Tipene Crisp, lawyer and New Zealand On Air board member Philip Crump, Ngāti Raukawa Treaty negotiator Vanessa Eparaima, veteran public servant Rex Edward Hale, Manawatū District Councillor Grant Hadfield, Tupuora Education founder and managing director Kingi Kiriona, former Defence Minister and Mayor of Carterton Ron Mark, and University of Waikato law Professor Tafaoimalo Leilani Tuala-Warren. In addition, Potaka renewed the warrants of six existing Tribunal members including Ruakere Hond, Derek Fox, Kim Ngarimu, Hana O&#x27;Regan, Pou Temara and Kevin Prime. Ten members including Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Tom Roa, Rawinia Higgins, Herewini Te Koha, Prue Kapua, Monty Soutar, Ron Crosby, Robyn Anderson, Tania Simpson and Grant Phillipson did not have their terms renewed. Left-wing blogger &quot;Mountain Tui&quot; criticised the Government&#x27;s decision not to renew the terms of mātauranga Maori academics Tuhiwai Smith, Roa and Higgins. Tui also criticised the appointment of partisan figures particularly Mark, Crump, Hadfield and Prebble. Similar criticism was voiced by Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, who 
described the removal of several well known Māori academics as a &quot;whitewash.&quot; In response, Potaka said that Ngarewa-Packer&#x27;s comments were &quot;unhelpful&quot; and undermined the knowledge and experience of the new appointees.

===Key points===

==Organisational structure and powers==

===Investigatory powers===
The Waitangi Tribunal is not a court. Since it was established as a permanent commission of inquiry, its method of investigation differs significantly from that of a court in several important respects:

*Generally, the Tribunal has authority only to make recommendations. In certain limited situations, the Tribunal does have binding powers, but in most instances, its recommendations do not bind the Crown, the claimants, or any others participating in its inquiries. In contrast, courts can make rulings that bind the parties to whom they relate.
*The Tribunal&#x27;s process is more inquisitorial and less adversarial than that followed in the courts. In particular, it can conduct its own research so as to try to find the truth of a matter, whereas courts generally must decide a matter solely on the evidence and legal arguments presented by the participating parties. Generally, a historian researcher carries out historical research for the tribunal claimants.
*The Tribunal&#x27;s process is flexible; it is not required to follow the rules of evidence that generally apply in the courts, and it may adapt its procedures as it thinks fit. For example, it may not allow cross examination, and hearsay or oral evidence is routinely accepted. For example, the Tribunal may follow &#x27;te kawa o te marae&#x27;. In contrast, court procedures are stricter and dependent on evidence. 
*The Tribunal does not have final authority to decide points of law. The power rests with the courts. However, the Tribunal has exclusive authority to determine the meaning and effect of the Treaty as it is embodied in both the Māori and English texts.
*The Tribunal has a limited power to summon witnesses, require the production of documents, and maintain order at its hearings. It does not have a general power to make orders preventing something from happening or compelling something to happen; nor can it make a party to Tribunal proceedings pay the costs.
*The Tribunal does not settle claims; in fact, it only makes recommendations to the Government. It is not involved in the settlement process, and claimants agree not to pursue matters through the Tribunal while they are engaged in the negotiation process.
*Claims are settled by negotiation with the Government. The Office of Treaty Settlements manages the negotiation of Treaty settlements for the Government, and all matters related to negotiations should be addressed to that office.
*The Tribunal cannot make recommendations over the return of private land. It may inquire into, and report on, claims relating to land that is privately owned, but unless the land is memorialised, the Tribunal may not recommend that it be returned to Māori ownership or that the Crown acquire it. Memorialised lands are lands owned, or formerly owned, by a State-owned enterprise or a tertiary institution, or former New Zealand Railways lands, that have a memorial (or notation) on their certificate of title advising that the Waitangi Tribunal may recommend that the land be returned to Māori ownership.
*The Tribunal can register the claim of any Māori with a grievance against a policy, practice, act, or omission of the Crown. The Tribunal is not required to check that a claimant has a mandate from any group, but it may refuse to inquire into a claim that is considered to be frivolous or vexatious.

The Tribunal process is inquisitorial, not adversarial. It seeks to get to the truth of the matter. The aim is to determine whether a claim is well founded.

===Tribunal members===

The Tribunal may have a chairperson and up to 20 members at any one time. Members are appointed by the Governor-General on behalf of the Monarch on the recommendation of the Minister of Māori Affairs in consultation with the Minister of Justice, for a renewable term of up to three years. For specific inquiries, a panel is composed of three to seven members, at least one of whom must be Māori. The chairperson of the Waitangi Tribunal can also appoint a Māori Land Court judge to act as presiding officer. This panel is then known as the Tribunal for that inquiry, e.g. the Central North Island Tribunal or the Taranaki Tribunal.

As of February 2025, the membership of the Tribunal was:
*Chairperson
** Chief Judge Dr Caren Fox, Chief Judge Māori Land Court

===The Waitangi Tribunal Unit===
The Waitangi Tribunal Unit is a special jurisdiction unit of the Ministry of Justice which provides support and services necessary for the Tribunal to do its work. Approximately 60 full-time staff work at the Tribunal, who are divided into the research, claims and registration, report writing, and inquiry facilitation teams.

==Notable tribunal inquiries==
===Taonga and the Wai 26 and 150 claim regarding radio frequencies===
In June 1986, the Waitangi Tribunal received the Wai 26 claim that the Treaty of Waitangi was breached by the Crown who failed to await recommendations within the Tribunal&#x27;s &quot;te reo Māori (1986) report&quot; before introducing a bill on the Māori language. This raised dispute as Māori were concerned that the bill might preempt and therefore not fully take into account the recommendations of the Waitangi Tribunal report. The second part of the claim identified that Te reo Māori held taonga status and the (then) Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand &quot;had not provided adequately for Māori radio listeners and television viewers.&quot; when the Crown had an obligation to uphold and promote te reo Māori through electronic mediums.

In June 1990, claim Wai 150 was lodged by Sir Graham Latimer on behalf of the New Zealand Māori Council. The claim was in respect of the Rangatiratanga over the allocation of radio frequencies; the claim being that in the absence of an agreement with the Māori, the sale of frequency management licences under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 would be in breach of the Treaty of Waitangi; denying Māori rights to the radio spectrum would therefore deny an instrumental means of providing te reo Māori to New Zealand. The Waitangi Tribunal amalgamated the Wai 26 with the Wai 150 claim. The final report of the Tribunal recommended that the Crown suspend the radio frequency tender process and proceed to negotiate with the Iwi.

===Ngāi Tahu claim===
The Ngāi Tahu Maori Trust Board filed the claim with the Waitangi Tribunal in 1986. The claim covered nine different areas and was heard over two years from 1987. The Tribunal released its three-volume report in 1991 – at that time it was the tribunal&#x27;s most comprehensive inquiry. It found that &quot;the Crown acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the Treaty of Waitangi&quot; in its land dealings with the tribe, and recommended substantial compensation. Ngāi Tahu also filed a claim in regards to commercial fisheries, in regards to which the Tribunal released its report in 1993. Ngāi Tahu settled with the Crown in 1998, and received $170 million in compensation, an apology, and the return of its sacred mountain Aoraki/Mount Cook (the tribe later gifted this back to the Nation).

===The Wai 262 claim in respect of mātauranga Māori===
On 2 July 2011, the Tribunal released its long-awaited report into the Wai 262 claim: &quot;Ko Aotearoa Tēnei&quot; (‘This is Aotearoa’ or ‘This is New Zealand’). The Wai 262 claim concerns the ownership of, and rights to, mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) in respect of indigenous flora and fauna. The Wai 262 claim, and the subsequent Ko Aotearoa Tēnei report, is unusual in Tribunal terms because of its wide scope and the contemporary nature of the issues being grappled with. It was the Tribunal&#x27;s first &#x27;whole-of-government&#x27; inquiry, and considers more than 20 government departments and agencies, and makes recommendations as to reforms of &quot;laws, policies or practices relating to health, education, science, intellectual property, indigenous flora and fauna, resource management, conservation, the Māori language, arts and culture, heritage, and the involvement of Māori in the development of New Zealand&#x27;s positions on international instruments affecting indigenous rights.&quot;

In the cover letter of the report, the Tribunal argues that: 
===Water and geothermal rights inquiry===

The New Zealand Māori Council brought the claim before the Tribunal in early 2012, arguing that the sale of 49 per cent of Mighty River Power (now Mercury Energy), Meridian Energy, and Genesis Energy would prejudice any possible future recognition of Māori rights in water and geothermal resources. On 1 August 2012, the Tribunal released a memorandum finding that the government should temporarily halt its asset sales programme until it had released its interim full report. The pre-publications report was subsequently released on 24 August, and suggested that the government should postpone the asset sales programme until the issue had been resolved with Māori around the country. This finding was reached on the basis that, if the government were to proceed with the partial-privatisation programme, it would reduce its ability to resolve outstanding claims to water and geothermal rights. In terms of potential avenues for resolution, the Tribunal recommended a national hui be called so that all parties to the dispute could voice their positions.

In response to the findings of The Tribunal, the National Government postponed the float of Mighty River Power until early 2013, but rejected calls for a national hui and the &quot;shares plus&quot; idea. Nevertheless, a hui was called for September 2012, but no representatives from the Government or the National Party attended. The issue was taken to court, with the courts ultimately ruling that the partial privatisation programme would not affect the Crown&#x27;s ability to provide redress to Maori, so the sales could continue.

===Te Paparahi o te Raki inquiry===
The Tribunal, &quot;Te Paparahi o te Raki&quot; inquiry (Wai 1040) is in the process of considering the Māori and Crown understandings of He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga / The Declaration of Independence 1835 and Te Tiriti o Waitangi / the Treaty of Waitangi 1840. This aspect of the inquiry raises issues as to the nature of sovereignty and whether the Māori signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi intended to transfer sovereignty.

The first stage of the report was released in November 2014. It found that Ngāpuhi chiefs never agreed to give up their sovereignty when they signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Tribunal manager Julie Tangaere said at the report&#x27;s release to the Ngāpuhi claimants:
===TPP/CPTPP inquiry===
In late June 2015, several prominent Māori figures including Dr Papaarangi Reid, Moana Jackson, Rikirangi Gage, Angeline Greensill, Hone Harawira and Moana Maniapoto filed a claim and urgent application with the Tribunal alleging that the New Zealand Government was breaching the Treaty of Waitangi in the way it was negotiating the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). The claimants argued that New Zealand&#x27;s adoption of the agreement would not require the consent of the New Zealand Parliament, objected to the lack of Māori involvement in the negotiation process and there was no legal obligation to assess the implications of the TPPA for the Treaty of Waitangi. In response to the claim, the Government argued that the secret nature of the TPP negotiations would allow the New Zealand Crown to negotiate in the best interests of the country. The Government also said that it had take steps to show that it had been considering Māori interests under the Treaty and maintained that it has been consulting with Māori in relation to the TPP. In early May 2016, the Waitangi Tribunal backed the inclusion of a Treaty of Waitangi clause in the finalised TPP trade deal. However, the Tribunal expressed concern that a clause allowing foreign investors to bring claims against the New Zealand Government could affect the Crown&#x27;s willingness or ability to meet its Treaty obligations.

In mid November 2021, the Waitangi Tribunal found that the New Zealand Crown had failed to meet its Treaty obligations to protect Māori interests as part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to the TPP, but acknowledged that several major changes occurred in the negotiation process. While the issues around the Crown&#x27;s engagement with Māori over the TPP/CPTPP and secrecy were resolved through mediation, the Tribunal found there were significant risks to Māori in the e-commerce provisions of the CPTPP and data sovereignty. As a result of the 2016 Tribunal ruling, a Māori advisory committee called Te Taumata was established while a second body known as Ngā Toki Whakarururanga was established as a result of the mediation agreement. Maniapoto welcomed the 2021 ruling as a vindication of Māori efforts to protect their Treaty rights in international agreements.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
On 19 November 2021, several members of the New Zealand Māori Council including Archdeacon Harvey Ruru and Tā Edward Durie filed an application for an urgent inquiry by the Waitangi Tribunal into Government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand for Māori. The plaintiffs argued that the Government&#x27;s vaccination rollout policies and plans to ease lockdown restrictions in December 2021 placed Māori at risk.

On 21 December, the Waitangi Tribunal ruled that the Government&#x27;s vaccination rollout and &quot;traffic light system&quot; breached the Treaty of Waitangi&#x27;s principles of active protection and equity. The Tribunal criticised the Government&#x27;s decision to prioritise those aged over 65 years and with health conditions during the vaccine rollout, arguing that they failed to address the youthful nature of the Māori population and its health vulnerabilities. The Tribunal also ruled that the Government&#x27;s transition to the &quot;traffic light system&quot; failed to take into account the lower Māori vaccination rate and health needs. The Tribunal also found that Government had not adequately consulted with Māori health providers and leaders and determined that efforts to address Māori needs such as the &quot;Māori communities Covid-19 fund&quot; were inadequate. The Waitangi Tribunal recommended that the Government improve data collection, improve engagement with the Māori community, and provided better support for ongoing vaccination efforts, testing, contact tracing, and support for Māori infected with COVID-19. The Tribunal&#x27;s ruling was welcomed by the Māori Council.

===Hearings during the Sixth National Government (2023–present)===
Following the 2023 New Zealand general election, the Sixth National Government and its ACT and New Zealand First coalition partners announced plans to roll out several policies, a move to which Māori objected. These included prioritising the use of the English language in the public service; a proposed Treaty Principles Bill; abolishing Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority); repealing Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989 (Children&#x27;s and Young People&#x27;s Well-being Act 1989) and the Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products (Smoked Tobacco) Amendment Act 2022. In response to these developments, the Waitangi Tribunal received several claims by various iwi (tribes) and individuals challenging the Government&#x27;s policies:

====Māori language urgent claim====
On 12 December 2023, the Tauranga-based iwi Ngai Te Rangi Settlement Trust filed an urgent claim arguing that the Government&#x27;s decision to discontinue financial incentives for public servants to learn the Māori language and directive for government departments Waka Kotahi (NZ Transport Agency) and Te Whatu Ora (Health NZ) to give primacy to their English names breached the Treaty of Waitangi and the New Zealand Bill of Rights.

On 10 June 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal began hearing Ngai Te Rangi&#x27;s Māori language claim, which was supported by Ngā Kaiwhakapūmau i te Reo (the Wellington Māori Language Board). The hearing was held in Wellington, with a contingent of iwi representatives traveling to the capital. The Tribunal heard from both iwi and Crown-nominated relatives. On the first day of the hearing, Ngai Te Rangi&#x27;s lawyer Mataanuku Mahuika argued that the Government had failed to abide with its legal obligation under the Māori Language Act to consult with iwi on issues regarding the Māori language. During the hearing, the Crown&#x27;s counsel said that the Government was committed to uphold its obligations under the Māori Language Act. Ngāi Te Rangi representative Roimata Stanley-Kaweroa claimed that the Government had targeted the Māori language and its speakers since it had come into power. Stanley Kaweroa only spoke in the Māori during the proceedings, which led to long pauses between questions and answers. While National&#x27;s coalition agreement with New Zealand First contained a commitment that all public service departments should communicate primarily in English and prioritise their Pakeha names, Crown lawyers testified that Public Service Minister Nicola Willis had decided against issuing directives to the public sector regarding the use of Māori but had given latitude to individual ministers and their agencies. Veteran civil servant and iwi leader Haami Piripi contended that the coalition agreement would override any minister&#x27;s commitment to the Māori language. The tribunal is expected to last until 14 June.

On 11 June, the Crown delivered its case. Acting Public Service Commissioner Heather Baggot, who is of Ngāti Maniapoto and Te Āti Awa descent, was cross-examined by Māori lawyer Mataanuku Mahuika. Baggot testified that all government departments apart from Te Puni Kōkiri (Ministry for Māori Development) and Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Children) had their legal names in English. Mahuika responded by arguing about the changing place names of Mount Egmont and Mount Taranaki.

====Te Aka Whai Ora urgent claims====
On 14 December 2023, Lady Tureiti Moxon and Janice Kuka filed the &quot;Wai 3307 Te Aka Whai Ora (Māori Health Authority) Urgent Claim,&quot; challenging the Government&#x27;s plans to dissolve Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority), claiming that it breached the Treaty of Waitangi. On 18 December, the Government filed a memorandum of counsel opposing Moxon and Kuka&#x27;s claim but conceded that it had no specific plan to address poor Māori health outcomes and had not consulted Māori in accordance with Treaty principles.

The Waitangi Tribunal was scheduled to hold an urgent hearing between 29 February and 1 March 2024 to critique the Government&#x27;s Te Aka Whai Ora repeal bill. However, the Government decided to pass urgent legislation dissolving the Māori Health Authority on 27 February. Since the Tribunal has no authority to consider issues being submitted before Parliament, its jurisdiction ended before the hearings could begin. In response, Lady Moxon denounced the Government&#x27;s decision to pass legislation dissolving the Māori Health Authority before the scheduled Tribunal hearing as disrespectful.

In mid May 2024, the Tribunal agreed to hear a second claim by Lady Moxon and Kuka for a &quot;priority inquiry&quot; into the Crown&#x27;s alternative proposals to improve Māori health in the absence of a Māori Health Authority. This priority is scheduled for October 2024 and will also look at the Government&#x27;s processes for disestablishing Te Aka Whai Ora. In January 2024, the Crown had decline to articulate its alternative proposal for improving Māori health, claiming it was still in development. By April 2024, the Crown had responded that Māori health was the subject of an ongoing law reform process. The Tribunal also directed the Crown to file a memorandum with an update on the matter by 27 May 2024.

On 29 November 2024, the Tribunal found that the Crown had breached the Treaty of Waitangi by diestablishing Te Aka Whai Ora. The Tribunal recommended that the Government reconsider establishing a stand-alone Māori health authority and consult with Māori. The claimants Moxon and Kuka welcomed the Tribunal&#x27;s report.

====Section 7AA claim====
On 23 December 2023 Te Tāwharau o Ngāti Pūkenga, the post settlement body for the Ngāti Pūkenga iwi, filed an urgent claim challenging the Government&#x27;s plans to repeal Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. Section 7AA requires Oranga Tamariki (the Ministry for Children) to take into account Māori children&#x27;s ancestry or whakapapa (genealogy) when uplifting children in order to keep them connected to their culture and families. Minister for Children and ACT MP Karen Chhour had lobbied for the repeal of Section 7AA, arguing that the policy prioritised the Treaty of Waitangi and cultural needs over the well-being of vulnerable Māori children.

In mid-April 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal summoned Chhour to attend an urgent inquiry into the proposed repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act. The Tribunal requested Chhour submit figures on the number of caregivers who had expressed concern about the impact of Section 7AA and examples of children being placed into unsafe conditions as a result of Section 7AA. On 17 April, Crown lawyers filed judicial proceedings in the High Court seeking to block the Tribunal&#x27;s summons. On 24 April, the High Court overturned the Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s subpoena to Chhour. In response, Treaty rights activist and lawyer Annete Sykes confirmed that she would be appealing the High Court&#x27;s ruling. According to Crown Law, Chhour plans to introduce legislation repealing Section 7AA in mid-May. Once Parliament has received the repeal bill, the Tribunal is compelled by law to cease any investigations into the matter. On 29 April, the Tribunal released an interim report expressing concern that the repeal of Section 7AA would harm vulnerable children. The full Tribunal report is due on 12 May 2024.

On 11 May, the Tribunal ruled that the Government&#x27;s proposed repeal of Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act breached the Treaty&#x27;s guarantee of Māori self-determination and the Treaty principles of partnership and active protection. They urged the Government to stop work on repealing the legislation. On 13 May, the New Zealand Court of Appeal overturns the High Court decision squashing the Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s summons to Chhour to testify at a hearing about the Government&#x27;s legislation to overturn Section 7AA. That same day, the Government&#x27;s Oranga Tamariki (Repeal of Section 7AA) Amendment Bill was introduced into Parliament.

====Smokefree repeal legislation claims====
On 3 February 2024, public health strategist Beverly Te Huia and the anti-smoking coalition Te Rōpū Tupeka Kore filed separate claims opposing the Government&#x27;s proposed repeal of the Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products (Smoked Tobacco) Amendment Act 2022. The Tribunal was scheduled to hold a hearing on the Smokefree repeal legislation between late February and early March 2024. On 27 February, the Government also introduced another urgent bill repealing the Smokefree legislation. Since the Tribunal has no authority to consider issues being submitted before Parliament, its jurisdiction ended before the hearings could begin. The Smokefree repeal legislation passed into law on 28 February.

====Māori wards claim====
On 8 May 2024, Pita Tipene, chairperson for Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Hine, challenged the Government&#x27;s decision to reinstate referenda on Māori wards and constituencies in local government bodies as an attack on their efforts to uphold their Treaty of Waitangi obligations. The Tribunal will hold an urgent inquiry prior to the introduction of the Government&#x27;s Māori wards referenda legislation on 20 May 2024. On 17 May, the Tribunal ruled that the Government&#x27;s plans to reinstate referenda requirements violated the Treaty of Waitangi.

====Treaty Principles claim====
On 9 May 2024, Ngāpuhi Kaumātua (tribal elder) Hone Sadler and several claimants argued that ACT&#x27;s proposed Treaty Principles Bill&#x27;s interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi was &quot;inaccurate and misleading.&quot; They also contended that Māori never ceded sovereignty to the New Zealand Crown. On 15 May, the Tribunal heard testimony from University of Auckland Māori Studies Professor Margaret Mutu, who described ACT&#x27;s Co-Government Policy Paper as &quot;nonsensical&quot; and as misinterpretation of the Treaty. In addition, Northland iwi Ngāti Kahu submitted a letter to King Charles III, calling on him to stop what they called a &quot;violent attack&quot; on the Treaty.

On 16 August 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal released its interim report into the ACT party&#x27;s Treaty Principles Bill and New Zealand First&#x27;s proposed review of the Treaty clauses. The Tribunal made four recommendations: that the Treaty Principles Bill be scrapped, that the Crown constitute a Cabinet Māori-Crown relations committee that has oversight of the Crown&#x27;s Treaty of Waitangi policies, that the Treaty clause review policy be suspended while it be reconceptualised through engagement with Māori, and that the Crown undertake a process to undo damage to the Māori-Crown relationship.

====Proposed foreshore and seabed changes====
On 21 May 2024, Treaty Negotiations Minister Paul Goldsmith, Oceans Fisheries Minister Shane Jones met with representatives of the seafood industry to discuss industry concerns about Māori customary marine titles and claims. On 30 July, Goldsmith announced that the National-led coalition government would disregard a 2023 New Zealand Court of Appeal ruling that lowered the threshold for proving Māori customary marine title claims. Goldsmith announce that the Government would also amend section 58 of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 to require marine title claimants to prove they had continual exclusive use and ownership of the area since 1840. This proposed law change was part of National&#x27;s coalition agreement with NZ First.

On 26 August 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal commenced an urgent inquiry into the Government&#x27;s plans to change the law to tighten the threshold for Māori customary marine title claims. The hearing was heard by Maori Land Court Judge Miharo Armstrong along with Tribunal members Ron Crosby and Pou Temara. On the first day, Treaty of Waitangi lawyer Tom Bennion criticised the Government for its perceived &quot;two-faced&quot; approach towards Māori and seeking to undermine Māori customary marine claims. On the second day, the Tribunal heard testimony from Te Arawhiti (Office for Māori Crown Relations) deputy secretary Tui Marsh, who had attended the 21 May meeting between cabinet ministers and seafood industry representatives.

On 13 September 2024, the Waitangi Tribunal released its initial report into the proposed changes to the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011. The Tribunal concluded that the Government had ignored official advice, failed to consult with Māori and breached several principles including active protection and good governance.

====Regulatory Standards Bill====
On 29 January 2025 the advocacy group Toitū te Tiriti, which organised the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti, filed an urgent Waitangi Tribunal claim opposing the proposed Regulatory Standards Bill. They claimed that the proposed legislation undermined the Treaty of Waitangi and would adversely affect Māori today and for future generations.

====Reactions====
The Waitangi Tribunal&#x27;s decision to hear these claims drew criticism from several figures in the Sixth National Government including NZ First MP and cabinet minister Shane Jones and ACT leader David Seymour, who regarded them as interferences into government policy delivery. On two occasions in January and February 2024, Jones called for the Tribunal&#x27;s powers to be reviewed and claimed the Government was delivering on election promises, stating that &quot;an institution that&#x27;s been around for 50 years should not expect to continue on uncritically for another set of decades without being reviewed.&quot; After the Waitangi Tribunal summoned Chhour in mid-April 2024, Jones likened the Tribunal to behaving like a star chamber. Jones&#x27; remarks were criticised by the Māori Law Society, who issued a letter to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Attorney-General Judith Collins complaining that Jones&#x27; remarks breached the Cabinet Manual and undermined the Tribunal&#x27;s work. Similarly, Seymour accused the Waitangi Tribunal of &quot;racial fanaticism&quot; and defended his ACT colleague Chhour&#x27;s efforts to repeal Section 7AA of the Oranga Tamariki Act. In response to media coverage, Luxon conceded that Jones and Seymour&#x27;s remarks were &quot;ill-considered,&quot; adding &quot;we expect all ministers to exercise good judgment on matters like this.&quot;

A provision within National&#x27;s coalition agreement with New Zealand First is that the coalition government will &quot;amend the Waitangi Tribunal legislation to refocus the scope, purpose and nature of its inquiries back to the original intent of that legislation.&quot; Ahunga Tikanga head law lecturer Carwyn Jones has described the wording of the agreement as vague while Victoria University of Wellington law lecturer Dr Luke Fitzmaurice-Brown expressed concerns about limiting the scope and powers of the Tribunal. By contrast, former Prime Minister Jenny Shipley and former Treaty Negotiations Minister Doug Graham have supported reviewing the powers and scope of the Waitangi Tribunal.

<text>Tiger Bay () was the local name for an area of Cardiff which covered Butetown and Cardiff Docks. Following the building of the Cardiff Barrage, which dams the tidal rivers, Ely and Taff, to create a body of water, it is referred to as Cardiff Bay. Tiger Bay is Wales’ oldest multi-ethnic community, with sailors and workers from over 50 countries settling there from the mid-19th century onwards.

==Background==
Cardiff Docks played a major part in Cardiff&#x27;s development as it was the means of exporting coal from the South Wales Valleys to the rest of the world, helping to power the Industrial Age. The coal mining industry helped fund the growth of Cardiff to become the capital city of Wales, and contributed towards making the docks&#x27; owner, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, the richest man in the world at the time.

In 1794, the Glamorganshire Canal was completed, linking Cardiff with Merthyr, and in 1798 a basin was built, connecting the canal to the sea. Increasing agitation for proper dock facilities led Cardiff&#x27;s foremost landowner, the 2nd Marquess of Bute, to promote the construction of the West Bute Dock, which opened in October 1839. Just two years later, the Taff Vale Railway opened. From the 1850s coal supplanted iron as the industrial foundation of South Wales, as the Cynon Valley and Rhondda Valley were mined.

==Growth of &#x27;Tiger Bay&#x27;==
As Cardiff&#x27;s coal exports grew, so did its population. Well-appointed residential areas were created in the 1840s and early 1850s, centred around Mount Stuart Square and Loudoun Square (between West Bute Street and the Glamorganshire Canal) to house the growing numbers of merchants, brokers, builders, and seafarers from across the world settling close to the docks. The area, known as Tiger Bay from the fierce currents around the local tidal stretches of the River Severn, became one of the UK&#x27;s oldest multicultural communities, with migrant communities from over 50 nationalities, including Norwegian, Somali, Yemeni, Spanish, Italian, Caribbean, and Irish. All the nationalities helped to create the multicultural character of the area, where people from different backgrounds socialised together and intermarried.

The East Bute dock opened in 1859. Coal exports from Cardiff Docks reached 2 million tons as early as 1862; by 1913, this had risen to 10,700,000 tons. Frustration at the lack of development at Cardiff led to rival docks being opened at nearby Penarth in 1865 and Barry in 1889. These developments eventually spurred Cardiff into action, with the opening of the Roath Dock in 1887 and the Queen Alexandra Dock in 1907. Coal exports from the South Wales Coalfield via Cardiff totalled nearly 9 million tons per annum, much of it exported in the holds of locally owned tramp steamers. The wealthier residents were able to move away to the new Cardiff suburbs. Butetown (particularly the area around Loudoun Square) became crowded, as families took in lodgers and split up the three-storey houses to help pay the rents.

Tiger Bay had a reputation as a tough and dangerous area; but locals who lived and stayed in the area describe a far friendlier place. Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world, only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships. Consequently, it has been said that the area became the red-light district of Cardiff, and many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished, as the perpetrators had sailed away. In reality the primary brothels streets, and the primary red light area, were Charlotte Street and Whitmore Lane, both of which were outside Tiger Bay. They were demolished, and the site is now the Marriott Hotel car park.

By 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression which followed the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tons, and dozens of locally owned ships were laid up. It was an era of depression from which Cardiff never really recovered, and despite intense activity at the port during the Second World War, coal exports continued to decline, finally ceasing in 1964.

===Redevelopment===
Coal exports were key to the local economy, which began to decline in the 1960s, when exports from the docks stopped. Housing clearances in the 1960s relocated many of the residents of Butetown, previously the residential core of the docklands, into unpopular tower blocks.
The economic decline in the 1960s and 1970s led to a 25% vacancy rate of buildings and 60% unemployment in Butetown. The infrastructure and buildings in the area declined: by the 1970s and 1980s the area required development and investment.

The price of land in the area decreased as there was a decline in traditional industry. This led to a rise in commercial developments, which were largely celebrated as a regeneration, although they displaced the local multicultural community as homes were demolished.

Around 1999, the area was redeveloped by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. This redevelopment was focused around the building of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, one of the most controversial building projects of the day, which impounded the rivers Taff and the Ely to create a massive freshwater lake. This resulted in the equally controversial renaming of the area as &quot;Cardiff Bay&quot;.

The opposition to the development was led on the grounds of removal of communities, and ecological preservation of the mud-flats and salt marshes which were home to wintering birds.
The funding available for the existing community was small and the Tiger Bay name was pushed out in favour of Cardiff Bay.

==Community and cultural spaces==
===Industrial and Maritime Museum===

In the redevelopment of the area, some long-standing cultural institutions were closed or demolished to make space for new buildings. In the 1970s, the Industrial and Maritime Museum was built on Bute Street to commemorate the heritage and history of the area. The museum, along with other historical buildings on Bute Street, were demolished in the 1990s to make space for the Mermaid Quay shopping and leisure development.

===Butetown History and Arts Centre===
In 1988, coinciding with the creation of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, the Butetown History and Arts Centre was created by the Butetown community to preserve the cultural-political heritage of the area. The centre was the site of historical oral recordings, educational events and activities for children and adults, and it also published books. The founder, an American historian named Glenn Jordan, was certain that the centre would remain an integral part of the regeneration project, since the area was deemed to be an example of a harmonious multi-racial community. However, the corporation provided no funding to the centre, and the space had to rely on external charitable funding to keep running. In late 2016, the long-standing institution could not obtain funding and was shut down. Its rich collection of the history of the Tiger Bay needed re-housing, and the last important link for communities that had been cleared out from the area, to make space for the re-generation, was now closed.

The BHAC collection has passed to The Heritage &amp; Cultural Exchange, a local community-based organisation.

<text>City Place is a mixed-use facility featuring two 20-story buildings in central Fort Worth, Texas. The complex was formerly known as Tandy Center and served as the corporate headquarters for RadioShack (formerly Tandy Corporation) for many years, designed by Growald Architects of Fort Worth, Texas and built by Beck. During the Tandy/RadioShack years, the complex included a mall and an ice skating rink.

Leonard&#x27;s Department Store opened on the site on February 12, 1963. In 1967, the Tandy Corporation bought the chain of department stores. As the corporation grew, it needed a new headquarters and so it demolished the department store in 1974 and constructed its headquarters on the site. The new Tandy Center included two office towers as well as a mall with an indoor ice skating rink. The mall was anchored by Dillard&#x27;s. In the 1990s the mall began to decline and the anchor tenant moved out in 1995. It was turned into an outlet store shopping center with hopes of it revitalizing Downtown Fort Worth, but these efforts failed and the mall was shuttered in the 2000s. It has since been demolished.

Originally built by the department store Leonard&#x27;s as Leonard&#x27;s M&amp;O Subway, the Tandy Center Subway operated between the center and fringe parking lots from 1963 to 2002. When Leonard&#x27;s was demolished the subway station was preserved and integrated into the new Tandy Center complex.

In 2000, a tornado hit Fort Worth, causing damage to several downtown buildings including the Tandy Center.

In 2001, the RadioShack Corporation sold the Tandy Center to another company, and made plans to construct a new corporate headquarters a few blocks away on the Trinity River. The new owner renamed the complex City Place. The former shopping mall was demolished in 2011, making way for a new garage with retail on the ground floor. As of 2021, City Place includes two multi-story buildings on opposite sides of Throckmorton Street, connected by a pedestrian skyway. The structures are made up principally of office and parking space.

<doc id="317082" wikidata="Q1585753" url="?curid=317082" title="Urethral stricture">
<text>A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra, the tube connected to the bladder that allows urination. The narrowing reduces the flow of urine and makes it more difficult or even painful to empty the bladder.

Urethral stricture is caused by injury, instrumentation, infection, and certain non-infectious forms of urethritis. The condition is more common in men due to their longer urethra.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The hallmark sign of urethral stricture is a weak urinary stream. Other symptoms include:
* Splaying of the urinary stream
* Urinary frequency
* Urinary urgency
* Straining to urinate
* Pain during urination
* Urinary tract infection
* Prostatitis
* Inability to completely empty the bladder.

Some people with severe urethral strictures are completely unable to urinate. This is referred to as acute urinary retention, and is a medical emergency. Hydronephrosis and kidney failure may also occur.

=== Complications ===

* Urinary retention
* Prostatitis
* Bladder dysfunction
* Urethral diverticulum
* Periurethral abscess
* Fournier&#x27;s gangrene
* Urethral fistula
* Bilateral hydronephrosis
* Urinary infections
* Urinary calculus
== Causes ==

Urethral strictures most commonly result from injury, urethral instrumentation, infection, non-infectious inflammatory conditions of the urethra, and after prior hypospadias surgery. Less common causes include congenital urethral strictures and those resulting from malignancy.

Urethral strictures after blunt trauma can generally be divided into two sub-types;
* Pelvic fracture-associated urethral disruption occurs in as many as 15% of severe pelvic fractures. These injuries are typically managed with suprapubic tube placement and delayed urethroplasty 3 months later. Early endoscopic realignment may be used in select cases instead of a suprapubic tube, but these patients should be monitored closely as vast majority of them will require urethroplasty.
* Blunt trauma to the perineum compresses the bulbar urethra against the pubic symphysis, causing a &quot;crush&quot; injury. These patients are typically treated with suprapubic tube and delayed urethroplasty.

Other specific causes of urethral stricture include:
* Instrumentation (e.g., after transurethral resection of prostate, transurethral resection of bladder tumor, or endoscopic kidney surgery)
* Infection (typically with gonorrhea)
* Lichen sclerosus
* Surgery to address hypospadias can result in a delayed urethral stricture, even decades after the original surgery.

== Diagnosis ==
Among ways to diagnose this condition is:

* Cystoscopy
* Urethrography

== Treatment ==
Initial treatment usually involves urethral dilation (widening the tube) or urethrotomy, where the stricture is cut away with a cystoscope.

=== Dilation and urethrotomy ===

Urethral dilation and other endoscopic approaches such as direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU), laser urethrotomy, and self intermittent dilation are the most commonly used treatments for urethral stricture. However, these approaches are associated with low success rates and may worsen the stricture, making future attempts to surgically repair the urethra more difficult.

A Cochrane review found that performing intermittent self-dilatation may confer a reduced risk of recurrent urethral stricture after endoscopic treatment, but the evidence is weak.

=== Urethroplasty ===

Urethroplasty refers to any open reconstruction of the urethra. Success rates range from 85% to 95% and depend on a variety of clinical factors, such as stricture as the cause, length, location, and caliber. Urethroplasty can be performed safely on men of all ages.

In the posterior urethra, anastomotic urethroplasty (with or without preservation of bulbar arteries) is typically performed after removing scar tissue.

In the bulbar urethra, the most common types of urethroplasty are anastomotic (with or without preservation of corpus spongiosum and bulbar arteries) and substitution with buccal mucosa graft, full-thickness skin graft, or split thickness skin graft. These are nearly always done in a single setting (or stage).

In the penile urethra, anastomotic urethroplasties are rare because they can lead to chordee (penile curvature due to a shortened urethra). Instead, most penile urethroplasties are substitution procedures utilizing buccal mucosa graft, full-thickness skin graft, or split-thickness skin graft. These can be done in one or more settings, depending on stricture location, severity, cause and patient or surgeon preference.

=== Urethral stent ===

A permanent urethral stent was approved for use in men with bulbar urethral strictures in 1996, but was recently removed from the market.

A temporary thermoexpandable urethral stent (Memotherm) is available in Europe but is not currently approved for use in the United States.

=== Emergency treatment ===

When in acute urinary retention, treatment of the urethral stricture or diversion is an emergency. Options include:
* Urethral dilatation and catheter placement. This can be performed in the Emergency Department, a practitioner&#x27;s office or an operating room. The advantage of this approach is that the urethra may remain patent for a period of time after the dilation, though long-term success rates are low.
* Insertion of a suprapubic catheter with catheter drainage system. This procedure is performed in an Operating Room, Emergency Department or practitioner&#x27;s office. The advantage of this approach is that it does not disrupt the scar and interfere with future definitive surgery.

=== Ongoing care ===

Following urethroplasty, patients should be monitored for a minimum of 1 year, since the vast majority of recurrences occur within 1 year.

Because of the high rate of recurrence following dilation and other endoscopic approaches, the provider must maintain a high index of suspicion for recurrence when the patient presents with obstructive voiding symptoms or urinary tract infection.

==Research==

=== Urethrotomy vs. urethroplasty ===
Comparing the two surgical procedures, a UK trial found that both urethrotomy and urethroplasty are effective in treating urethral narrowing in the bulbar region. At the same time the more invasive urethroplasty had longer-lasting benefit and was associated with fewer re-interventions. The results were integrated into the new UK guidelines on the treatment urethral narrowing by British Association of Urological Surgeons.

=== Bioengineering ===
The use of bioengineered urethral tissue is promising, but still in the early stages. The Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine has pioneered the first bioengineered human urethra and in 2006 implanted urethral tissue grown on bioabsorbable scaffolding (approximating the size and shape of the affected areas) in five young (human) males who had congenital defects, physical trauma, or an unspecified disorder necessitating urethral reconstruction. As of March 2011, all five recipients report the transplants have functioned well.

=== Cell therapy approach through endoscopy ===

Buccal mucosal tissue harvested under local anesthesia after culturing in the lab when applied through endoscopy after urethrotomy in a pilot study has yielded encouraging results. This method named as BEES-HAUS procedure needs to be validated through a larger multicentric study before becoming a routine application.

<doc id="317084" wikidata="Q1474092" url="?curid=317084" title="Houston Aeros (1994–2013)">
<text>The Houston Aeros were a professional ice hockey team in the International Hockey League (IHL) and the American Hockey League (AHL). The team played in Houston, Texas, at The Summit (renamed Compaq Center in 1998) from 1994 until 2003 and the Toyota Center from 2003 to 2013. In the IHL, the team operated as an independent minor league team from 1994 to 2001, though the team occasionally accepted players on loan from various National Hockey League (NHL) clubs for development. Upon joining the AHL for the 2001–02 season, they became the primary affiliate of the one-year-old NHL expansion team, the Minnesota Wild, a partnership they maintained until the franchise&#x27;s relocation in 2013. While the team&#x27;s only formal partnership with the Dallas Stars was a partial affiliation agreement during the 2004–05 season, Dallas occasionally sent some of their prospects to the Aeros on individual loans from 1993 to 2005, until the establishment of the Iowa Stars gave Dallas its own primary farm team.

As of November 2023, Cal Clutterbuck, Jared Spurgeon, Matt Dumba, Charlie Coyle, Darcy Kuemper, Jonas Brodin and Jason Zucker are the only players active in the NHL who had once spent time in Houston.

==History==
=== IHL years ===
The Houston Aeros started out as an expansion franchise in the International Hockey League (IHL) in 1994 with home games at The Summit. The team&#x27;s name was a tribute to the original Houston Aeros of the World Hockey Association in the 1970s, who won the Avco World Trophy twice with hockey legend Gordie Howe anchoring the team. The Aeros were the second IHL team to be named after a WHA franchise, the first being the Phoenix Roadrunners; unlike the Roadrunners, who used the same logo as their WHA predecessor, the IHL Aeros used a new logo, a Douglas B-23 Dragon bomber underneath a stylized wordmark. The original color scheme was forest green, navy blue, and a red accents on jerseys.

The team was an immediate success, both on the ice and at the gate. The Aeros posted a winning record in their inaugural season and made the playoffs, while the team repeatedly sold out its home games at The Summit after not having professional hockey in the region for nearly two decades. Despite missing the playoffs in their sophomore campaign, the Aeros spent the back half of the 1990s becoming one of the more dominant teams of the IHL. Independently owned and operated by Chuck Watson without a primary National Hockey League (NHL) affiliate, the franchise spent money on younger players still trying to make a name for themselves and former NHL players at the end of their careers. Some of these signings included Mark Freer, who set the Houston franchise record for career goals, eventual coach Mike Yeo, veteran NHL player Jim Paek, and goaltending duo Frederic Chabot and Manny Fernandez. In 1996, Watson hired former Hartford Whalers&#x27; player Dave Tippett as his head coach. Houston won 44 games in 1996–97 and followed that with their first 50-win campaign the next year, losing in the 1998 Western Conference Finals to the Long Beach Ice Dogs.

By the start of the 1998–99 season, the Aeros were led by the goalie tandem of Chabot and Fernandez posted a combined 2.35 goals against average, the best average in the league, minor league journeyman Jeff Christian scored a team-leading 45 goals and 109 points (including 88 assists) from former Michigan Wolverines&#x27; player Brian Wiseman. Houston earned a 54–15–13 record for 121 points in the standings and the Fred A. Huber Trophy for the regular season championship.

Despite their regular season, the Aeros struggled in the playoffs. While they earned a bye from the best-of-three preliminary round, it took Houston the full five games series to eliminate the Long Beach Ice Dogs in the second round. In the Western Conference Finals, Houston faced the Chicago Wolves, which took seven games for the Aeros to advance to their first Turner Cup Finals. The Aeros then faced the Orlando Solar Bears for the 1999 Turner Cup and again lasted seven games. In front of a sold-out home crowd of more than 16,000, the Aeros won their first championship with a 5–3 victory.

Following the 1999 Turner Cup championship, Dave Tippett left to take an assistant job with the Los Angeles Kings. Captain Mike Yeo signed an NHL contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins, who assigned him to their minor league affiliate in the AHL, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. While Houston still posted winning seasons with playoff appearances the next two years, they were never able to get close to another Turner Cup.

===AHL years===
By 2001, the IHL was struggling financially. The league had rapidly expanded in the 1980s and 1990s, included moving into already established NHL markets. As a result, the NHL actively encouraged its owners to reassign their development operations to clubs in the American Hockey League (AHL), the chief rival of the IHL. Without any support from the NHL and league costs increasing, the IHL declared bankruptcy and disbanded during the summer of 2001. With the AHL looking to increase its prestige as the top development league for the NHL, the AHL began discussions to absorb some of the IHL&#x27;s clubs. The AHL and IHL eventually agreed for the AHL to absorb six franchises for the 2001–02 season: the Aeros, Chicago Wolves, Grand Rapids Griffins, Milwaukee Admirals, Manitoba Moose, and Utah Grizzlies.

The Aeros joined the AHL one year after the NHL expanded with the Minnesota Wild and did not have a primary development affiliate. Due to Houston&#x27;s George Bush Intercontinental Airport making travel for prospects easier, the Wild entered an agreement with the Aeros as their top development affiliate. Todd McLellan was installed as head coach by the Wild and the Aeros made the Western Conference Finals in their first AHL season before falling to their old IHL rivals, the Chicago Wolves.

For the 2002–03 season, the Aeros were led by 31 goals from Jean-Guy Trudel and goaltending from Johan Holmqvist and Derek Gustafson. Houston swept the Milwaukee Admirals in the first round, defeated the Norfolk Admirals in six games, and then advanced through the Western Conference Finals with a game seven win over the Grand Rapids Griffins. Houston faced the Hamilton Bulldogs in the 2003 Calder Cup Finals, again going for the full seven games before the Aeros won the Calder Cup.

Before the 2003–04 season, the team moved to the newly opened Toyota Center. As part of the transition, the majority ownership of the Aeros was sold to the Minnesota Wild who then replaced the original bomber logo to a new logo featuring a forward-facing modern fighter jet below a bold &quot;AEROS&quot;, and switched to the WHA Aeros colors of light and dark blue for two seasons. As NHL teams began to build stronger ties with their farm clubs, the Aeros colors were changed to match the Wild&#x27;s forest green and iron range red with wheat accents. Prior to the 2006–07 season, the Aeros brought back the original bomber logo associated with their championship seasons with only minor color alterations; the navy blue elements of the original logo were replaced with forest green.

On the ice, the Aeros remained competitive, qualifying for the playoffs eight times in the last ten seasons. They made it to the 2009 Western Conference Finals before being eliminated by the Manitoba Moose and made it back to the Calder Cup Finals in 2011, but lost in six games to the Binghamton Senators.

The Aeros played its final game on May 4, 2013, in a 7–0 loss to the Grand Rapids Griffins in a game in the opening round of the 2013 Calder Cup playoffs.

=== Relocation to Iowa ===
Despite the local popularity and high average attendance of the team, the team was having trouble off the ice where the Aeros and owner Chuck Watson were part of dispute with the Houston Rockets and owner Les Alexander over their shared arenas. Since the 1990s, Watson operated The Summit, which acted as the home arena for both teams, and had control over the lease agreement with the Rockets, which had been purchased by Alexander in 1993. When Alexander tried to break the Rockets lease on the building shortly after their 1995 title, Watson blocked the move, holding Alexander to his original agreement of expiration in 2003. While a new arena was needed to replace the aging facility, the two sides agreed to an arena deal in 1997 that would give the Rockets and Aeros equal control over a new building. However, the referendum for a new building was rejected by Harris County voters in 1999.

In 2001, Alexander reached his own agreement with the City of Houston to build the Toyota Center. The lease agreements of both the Aeros and Rockets expired in the summer of 2003, and with the city set to sell Compaq Center to Lakewood Church, the Aeros were forced to move into the Toyota Center and pay rent to the Rockets on a three-year lease. Watson then sold the majority ownership to the Minnesota Sports and Entertainment (MS&amp;E), the parent company of the Minnesota Wild, with Watson retaining a 10% share, in order to pay for the increased costs.

When the initial agreement between the Aeros and Rockets expired, Alexander&#x27;s rent price skyrocketed. Negotiations were so stymied that Chuck Watson nearly relocated his hockey team in 2006. The AHL and NHL both entered the negotiations and the Aeros and Rockets agreed to a new seven-year agreement that ran through the 2012–13 season. Under the agreement though, the Aeros were paying one of the highest rents of any AHL franchise.

By the 2012–13 season, Alexander had expressed he wanted to use the 38 Aeros&#x27; home dates to instead host concerts in order to generate more revenue. In the first negotiations between Alexander and MS&amp;E, the Rockets&#x27; owner demanded a 550% increase in the team&#x27;s rent if they wanted to stay. MS&amp;E instead began exploring other options, settling on Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa, which last was home to the Iowa Chops in 2009. On April 18, 2013, MS&amp;E announced that the Aeros would be relocated to Des Moines at the conclusion of the 2013 Calder Cup playoffs. Following the relocation, MS&amp;E&#x27;s rent went from one of the highest in the AHL to one of the lowest: 27th of the AHL&#x27;s 30 franchises.

<doc id="317085" wikidata="Q767236" url="?curid=317085" title="Tsukahara Bokuden">
<text>was a famous swordsman of the early Sengoku period. He was described as a &quot;kensei&quot; (sword saint). He was the founder of a new Kashima style of kenjutsu, and served as an instructor of Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru and Ise provincial governor &quot;daimyō&quot; Kitabatake Tomonori.

==Early life==
Bokuden was born into the Yoshikawa family within the Hitachi Province of Honshu. The family was one of four Karō families serving the Kashima clan; one of the cadet branches of the Imperial House of Japan (descendants of the ).
Bokuden was adopted by the Tsukahara family, an offshoot of the Kashima clan; he was styled as Tsukahara Bokuden Takamoto. Earlier in his life, his name was &quot;Tsukahara Shin&#x27;emon Takamoto&quot;.

==Career==
Bokuden learned the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū from his adopted father and later honed his skills by engaging in &quot;musha shugyō&quot; (warrior&#x27;s ascetic training), traveling throughout Japan and training with most of the skillful and knowledgeable swordsmen of the day. Tsukahara Bokuden was the classic knight-errant; a rich nobleman, he travelled the Japanese countryside, often with a full entourage. He later systematized the teaching of the Kashima area&#x27;s local martial arts, including such approaches to combat as &quot;Kashima no tachi&quot; and &quot;Ichi no tachi&quot;. After allegedly receiving a divine inspiration from &quot;Takemikazuchi no kami&quot;, the deity of Kashima Shrine, he named his martial system as Kashima Shintō-ryū. He also, for a brief period, called his system &quot;Mutekatsu-ryū&quot; (&quot;winning without hands&quot;).

In one anecdote recorded in the &quot;Kōyō Gunkan&quot;, Bokuden was challenged by a mannerless ruffian. When asked about his style, Bokuden replied that he studied the &quot;Style of No Sword&quot;. The ruffian laughed and insultingly challenged Bokuden to fight him without a sword. Bokuden then agreed to fight the man without his sword but suggested they row out to a nearby island on Lake Biwa to avoid disturbing others. The ruffian agreed, but when he jumped from the boat to the shore of the island, drawing his blade, Bokuden pushed the boat back out, leaving the ruffian stranded on the island. Bokuden explained: &quot;This is my no-sword school&quot;. Bruce Lee was so fond of this story, that in &quot;Enter the Dragon (1973)&quot; he teaches a bully a lesson about &quot;Fighting without Fighting&quot;, when he offers to leave a junk and sail to an island.
There is a fictional story that the young Miyamoto Musashi challenged Bokuden to a duel during a meal. When Musashi struck first, Bokuden parried the blade using the potlid from the meal as a shield (as depicted in a nishiki-e by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi). As Tsukahara Bokuden had died in 1571, 13 years before Musashi&#x27;s birth in 1584, the meeting is an apocryphal myth.

According to modern Japanese author and practitioner of Japanese martial arts, Tokitsu Kenji, Tsukahara fought his first duel to the death at the age of 17. Through his lifetime, he fought another 19 duels and in 37 battles. He was wounded 6 times but only by arrows. His death toll is estimated to have been 212 kills.

==Death and legacy==
Bokuden died of natural causes in 1571. His grave at is in Kashima, Ibaraki. Those devoted to the art of Japanese sword-fighting, would make pilgrimages to the Kashima Shrine because it is considered the spiritual home of kenjutsu.

<text>Cardiff Bay Barrage () lies across the mouth of Cardiff Bay, Wales between Queen Alexandra Dock and Penarth Head. It was one of the largest civil engineering projects in Europe during construction in the 1990s.

==History==
===Origin===
The origin of the scheme dates back to a visit by Nicholas Edwards, the Secretary of State for Wales, to the largely-derelict Cardiff docklands in the early 1980s. An avid opera enthusiast, Edwards envisaged a scheme to revitalise the area incorporating new homes, shops, restaurants and, as a centrepiece, an opera house at the waterside. However the tidal nature of Cardiff Bay, exposing extensive mudflats save for two hours either side of high water, was seen as aesthetically unappealing.

Edwards credited the solution to this perceived problem to a Welsh Office civil servant, Freddie Watson. Watson proposed building a barrage stretching across the mouth of Cardiff Bay from Cardiff Docks to Penarth, which would impound freshwater from the rivers Ely and Taff to create a large freshwater lake, thus providing permanent high water. By making the area more appealing, investment was to be attracted to the docklands.

The development was also inspired by the redevelopment of Baltimore Inner Harbor in the US, where a largely derelict port area was transformed into a thriving commercial district and tourist attraction.

The barrage was consequently seen as central to the regeneration project. In 1987, prior to approval of the construction of the barrage, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was established to proceed with redeveloping the docklands.

===Completion===
In November 1999, the barrage was completed, with the sluice gates closed at high water, to retain the seawater from the Bristol Channel within the 500 acre (200 hectare) bay.

==Water quality==
Oxygenation systems (based on those used at the Swansea Barrage) were installed which improved water quality and allowed the composition of the bay to become entirely freshwater, the only saltwater ingress being that from the three locks providing access to and from the Severn estuary for the proliferating number of boats using Cardiff Bay. This salt water sinks to the bottom of the bay which is then sucked back out to sea via a drainage basin connected to a salt water shaft. 

The barrage was opened to the public in 2001.

==Opposition==
The barrage scheme was opposed by environmentalists and, according to a BBC investigation, by the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Treasury officials had queried the economic case for the development and the economic methodology used to justify it. In 1990, a select committee, which had been unable to examine all economic details it wanted, voted 3–1 in favour of the scheme. Subsequently, BBC Wales discovered that Thatcher wanted to scrap the barrage proposal until Edwards threatened to resign.

Opposition to the project also came from many other quarters. One of the most prominent critics was the then Cardiff West Member of Parliament (MP), Rhodri Morgan (Labour), who was later to become First Minister of the Welsh Assembly. Morgan, like Thatcher, said that the scheme would cost too much money. It was reported by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in March 2000 that the costs of the barrage construction alone had risen to £400 million, and there would be additional £12 million a year charge for maintenance and operation. Morgan said, &quot;This is far higher than was ever identified to Parliament during the passage of the Barrage Bill&quot;.

In the meantime, local residents living near the edge of the bay and the banks of River Taff feared that their homes would be damaged by the permanently raised water level, as they had been in several previous floods. Environmental groups strongly opposed construction because the bay was an important feeding ground for birds, which would be lost following impoundment. Concerns were also raised over groundwater levels in low-lying areas of Cardiff possibly affecting cellars and underground electrical junctions.

During the development of Cardiff Bay and of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, there was constant tension between the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and Cardiff City Council (later Cardiff County Council). The National Assembly&#x27;s Audit Committee spoke of a &quot;fractured working relationship&quot; between the two bodies. After the original impoundment of the waters of Cardiff Bay in November 1999 plans were mooted for a Royal inauguration of the barrage. That, it was envisaged, would be held on St David&#x27;s Day 2000 to be attended by the Queen and Morgan, a vociferous opponent of the scheme. In the event, no such event took place. On 1 March 2000, the day scheduled for the ceremony, the National Assembly of Wales announced that there would be no special ceremony held to mark the project.

In place of an official Royal inauguration of this massive civil engineering scheme, the largest of its kind in Europe, a modest ceremony was arranged by Cardiff Bay Development Corporation at which a former Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Councillor Ricky Ormonde (who had served as Lord Mayor in 1994) officiated along with Alun Michael Labour and Co-operative MP for Cardiff South and Penarth who had always supported the scheme. However, as Cardiff Council would not accommodate the installation of a commemorative plaque on their land, the ceremony had to be performed and the plaque unveiled on land owned by the adjacent local authority, the Vale of Glamorgan Council at the Penarth end of the barrage. That was also the site chosen for the installation of a 7-foot tall bronze figure of a mermaid – which was the logo of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. (The logo had been designed by Cardiff graphics artist Roger Fickling.)

The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was wound up on 31 March 2000, handing over control of the completed project to Cardiff Council. Soon afterwards the plaque at the Penarth end of the barrage was removed and an entirely new plaque erected midway along the barrage. The new plaque made no mention of Cardiff Bay Development Authority. The bronze figure of the CBDC symbol of the mermaid, however, remained on the roundabout, at the entrance to the Penarth end of the barrage.

==Construction==

Construction was undertaken by a Balfour Beatty / Costain Joint Venture. The electrical and control systems equipment was designed, installed and commissioned by Lintott Control Systems (Norwich). Construction started in 1994, following the successful passage of the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act 1993 through the UK Parliament. The bill included provisions for compensation for any homes damaged by the barrage and a large wetland habitat for birds further east down the Bristol Channel. Features include a fish pass to allow salmon to reach breeding grounds in the River Taff and three locks for maritime traffic. Construction was completed in 1999 and shortly afterwards the barrage came into effect. The impounding of the River Taff and River Ely created a freshwater lake.

==Today==
The barrage has played an important role in the regeneration of the area. Attractions such as the Wales Millennium Centre, The Senedd, shopping and watersports have since moved onto the waterfront. In 2000 the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was dissolved, and the Welsh Assembly awarded a contract to Cardiff County Council to manage the barrage, as Cardiff Harbour Authority (CHA).

One of the major selling points of the proposed development was the opening up of a new pedestrian and cycle route across the barrage. This would not only enhance tourism on both sides but provide a pleasant and safe short-cut between Cardiff and Penarth, cutting two miles off the journey otherwise taken on the heavy-traffic roads further upstream. However, this benefit took years to materialise due to a lack of agreement between the derelict access land owners (Associated British Ports) and Cardiff Council. Cardiff Harbour Authority made significant progress in the creation of the bay edge walkway and have redeveloped a large portion of the previously inaccessible bay periphery and the bay edge walkway was finally completed and open to the public on Monday 30 June 2008, allowing public access from Mermaid Quay to Penarth Marina. The CHA has developed a Sea Angling zone on the outer breakwater arm.

The Cardiff Bay Barrage has won awards as a feat of engineering from the British Construction Industry and achieved the Institution of Civil Engineers Brunel Medal.

===Artwork===
The Cardiff Bay Arts Trust (CBAT), now known as Safle, commissioned Swiss artist Felice Varini to produce a piece of public art for the CHA, entitled &quot;3 Ellipses for 3 Locks&quot;. It cost £25,000 and was produced between 11 and 25 March 2007. Three yellow ellipses were painted onto locks and gates, with professional mountain climbers being used to access the barrage&#x27;s more difficult sections. It was Varini&#x27;s first work in Wales and the UK and took a year to plan.

The bronze mermaid which stands on the roundabout at the Penarth end of the barrage was designed by Cardiff graphics artist Roger Fickling and comprised the official logo of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. It was installed on Vale of Glamorgan land because of tensions between the CBDC and Cardiff Council (see above).

===Yacht clubs and marinas===
There are two yacht clubs and three marinas associated with the barrage:
*Cardiff Bay Yacht Club – sited on the north side of the river between Cardiff and Penarth.
*Cardiff Yacht Club – situated centrally, near the main road bridge.
*Cardiff Marina – situated up-river of Cardiff Bay Yacht Club on the River Ely.
*Grangemoor Quay – Based higher up on the River Ely
*Penarth Marina – a development of a former commercial dock. The marina predated the barrage, so yachts need to pass through the marina&#x27;s own locks as well as the barrage locks to reach the sea.

===Motorsport===
The barrage was used as a special stage during the 2010 Wales Rally GB.

==Impact on the ecology of the bay==

===Birds===
According to two studies published in 2006, the loss of intertidal mudflats has resulted in the numbers and diversity of the birds using Cardiff Bay greatly reducing. Almost all of the common shelduck and shorebirds that used the bay when mud was exposed no longer feed there. Initially these birds used nearby sites to feed, but in most cases, this behaviour was not sustained, and the birds were unable to settle elsewhere. Common redshanks displaced from Cardiff Bay settled at the nearby Rhymney estuary, but they exhibited lower body weight, and their annual survival rate declined from 85% to 78% as a result of lower levels of winter survival.

===Algae===
The freshwater lake had problems with blue-green algae initially which made it impossible to swim in the water or participate in water sports. These issues have now largely been resolved though some toxic algae remain in some of the dock areas in the bay.

===Zebra mussels===
Cardiff Bay has become the first area of freshwater in Wales to be infested with zebra mussels – an alien species to the UK which multiplies rapidly to the detriment of native marine life. The Cardiff Harbour Authority has decreed that &quot;Personal watercraft&quot; used in Cardiff Bay such as kayaks, canoes and sailing dinghies must be washed down with bleach solution before being taken to any other area of freshwater.

<text>Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is a pale yellow to light brown liquid organic compound used as an adjuvant component of pesticide formulations for synergy. That is, despite having no pesticidal activity of its own, it enhances the potency of certain pesticides such as carbamates, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and rotenone. 
It is a semisynthetic derivative of safrole and is produced from the condensation of the sodium salt of 2-(2-butoxyethoxy) ethanol and the chloromethyl derivative of hydrogenated safrole (dihydrosafrole);
or through 1,2-Methylenedioxybenzene.

== History ==
PBO was developed in the late 1930s and early 1940s to enhance the performance of the naturally derived insecticide pyrethrum. Pyrethrum is a type of potent insecticide that kills mosquitoes and other disease-carrying vectors, thereby providing public health benefits, such as preventing malaria. Although exhibiting little intrinsic insecticidal activity of its own, PBO increases the effectiveness of pyrethrins, thus it is called a synergist. PBO was first patented in 1947 in the US by Herman Wachs.

There are 3 known manufacturer of PBO in the world, Endura, Tagros and Catasynth (Anthea) who manufacture PBO through the MDB route.

== Uses ==
PBO was first registered in the United States in the 1950s. PBO is mainly used in combination with insecticides, such as natural pyrethrins or synthetic pyrethroids, in ratios (PBO: pyrethrins) ranging from 3:1 to 20:1. Appearing in over 1,500 United States EPA-registered products, PBO is one of the most commonly registered synergists as measured by the number of formulas in which it is present. It is approved for pre- and postharvest application to a wide variety of crops and commodities, including grain, fruits and vegetables. The application rates are low; the highest single rate is 0.5 lbs PBO/acre.

It is used extensively as an ingredient with insecticides to control insect pests in and around the home, in food-handling establishments such as restaurants, and for human and veterinary applications against ectoparasites (head lice, ticks, fleas). A wide variety of water-based PBO-containing products such as crack and crevice sprays, total release foggers, and flying insect sprays are produced for and sold to consumers for home use. PBO has an important public health role as a synergist used in pyrethrins and pyrethroid formulations used for mosquito control (e.g. space sprays, surface sprays and bed nets). Because of its limited, if any, insecticidal properties, PBO is never used alone.

== Mechanism of action ==
PBO acts as an insecticide synergist by inhibiting the natural defense mechanisms of the insect, the most important of which is the mixed-function oxidase system, (MFOs) also known as the cytochrome P-450 system. The MFO system is the primary route of detoxification in insects, and causes the oxidative breakdown of insecticides such as pyrethrins and the synthetic pyrethroids – thus when PBO is added, higher insecticide levels remain in the insect to exercise their lethal effect. An important consequence of this property is that, by enhancing the activity of a given insecticide, less may be used to achieve the same result.

PBO does not appear to have a significant effect on the MFO system in humans. PBO is found to be an efficacious, low-potency, neutral antagonist of G-protein-coupled CB1 receptors.

Other synergists for pyrethroid insecticides include Sesamex and &quot;Sulfoxide&quot; (not to be confused with the functional group).

== Regulatory ==
PBO is regulated in the United States and some other countries as a pesticide, even though PBO does not have this property. The United States Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the law that gives United States EPA its authority to regulate pesticides, includes certain synergists in its definition of a “pesticide” and is thus subject to the same approval and registration as products that kill pests, like the insecticides with which PBO is formulated. Pesticide registration is the process through which United States EPA examines the ingredients of a pesticide, where and how the pesticide is used (e.g., whole room fogger, crack-and-crevice, etc.), and the specific use pattern (amount and frequency of its use). United States EPA also evaluates the pesticide to ensure that it will not have unreasonable adverse effects on humans, the environment and non-target species. The United States EPA must register pesticides before they may be sold or distributed in the United States. Registration is required for the pesticide itself, as well as for all products containing it. The World Health Organization recognizes the public health value of PBO when used in conjunction with the synthetic pyrethroids deltamethrin or permethrin used in mosquito nets.

== Hazard assessment ==

Numerous toxicology studies have been conducted over the past 40 years on PBO examining the full range of potential toxic effects. These studies were conducted in accord with regulatory requirements put forth by the United States EPA or other international agencies. Many were conducted following United States EPA Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), a system of processes and controls to ensure the consistency, integrity, quality, and reproducibility of laboratory studies conducted in support of pesticides registration. The following types of studies have been conducted in support of PBO registration:

=== Acute toxicity studies === 
Acute toxicity studies are designed to identify potential hazards from acute exposures. The studies usually employ a single or a few high doses over a short time period. The data are used for the development of appropriate precautionary statements for pesticide product labels. Acute studies identify: 
* Dermal toxicity
* Eye irritation
* Inhalation toxicity
* Oral toxicity
* Skin irritation
* Skin sensitization

PBO has a low acute toxicity by oral, inhalation, and dermal routes in adults. It is minimally irritating to the eyes and skin. It is a not a skin sensitizer.

=== Dermal absorption ===
The available data indicate that less than 3% of the amount on the skin (forearm) is absorbed over an 8-hour period. Other studies with a pediculicide formulation indicate that about 2% crossed the skin and about 8% crossed the scalp.

=== Endocrine disruption === 
The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 required the United States EPA to address the issue of endocrine disruption. PBO is one of the chemicals selected by EPA to be part of the initial effort under the endocrine disruption screening program (EDSP). PBO was added to this list because of its wide use pattern (1500 products registered with US EPA), and people may be exposed to low levels of PBO in their diets, from treated surfaces in their homes (e.g., carpet), and in certain occupations (e.g., pest control operators).

No evidence suggests that PBO disrupts the normal functioning of the endocrine system. This includes the recently developed data to assess the possible interaction of PBO with the endocrine system. The Piperonyl Butoxide Task Force II, a group of companies that produces or markets PBO-containing products, has conducted all 11 EDSP Tier 1 screens and has submitted all required documentation and study reports.

The US EPA intends to use a weight of evidence (WoE) approach for assessing EDSP Tier 1 results. While the agency issued WOE guidelines, no actual WOE assessments have yet been conducted and released to the registrants. The PBTFII has conducted a WoE analysis for PBO that is consistent with EPA’s guidelines. The WoE analysis for PBO examines each EDSP Tier 1 assay conducted for PBO. It discusses the purpose of the assay, and summarizes the study design and results and provides an overall conclusion for each assay. All 11 individual assays are then considered together to arrive at an overall conclusion for the outcome of the Tier 1 battery. For some assays, other scientifically relevant information is also considered as part of the assessment. The purpose of the WoE analysis is to determine whether PBO has the potential to interact with the endocrine system, as determined by EDSP Tier 1 assays, the Tier 1 battery as a whole and OSRI. A determination that a chemical has the potential to interact with the endocrine system would trigger a need for EDSP Tier 2 testing. The EPA is planning to issue their WOE assessment in late 2014 or early 2015.

=== Subchronic and chronic/carcinogenicity studies ===
Subchronic and chronic studies examine the toxicity of longer-term, repeated exposure to chemicals. They may range from 90 days for subchronic studies, to 12–24 months for full lifetime chronic studies, designed to determine potential for carcinogenesis. They are also intended to identify any noncancer effects, as well as a clear no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) that is used for risk assessment. Studies conducted on PBO include:
* 90-day inhalation toxicology study
* 18-month chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in mice
* 24-month chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study in rats

NOAELs were derived for PBO from both subchronic and chronic studies. These NOAELs are used by the EPA to conduct risk assessments for all individual uses of PBO to ensure that all registered products with PBO pose a reasonable certainty of no harm used according to the label directions. 
PBO caused an increase in liver tumors in mice that ingested high levels of PBO in the diet for their entire lifetimes. The scientific identification and analysis of the key events leading to the formation of the mouse liver tumors suggest that the events are not likely to occur in humans.

The EPA classifies PBO as a group C carcinogen – &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans.&quot; Under the auspices of the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues evaluated the entire body of toxicology of PBO several times since 1965. They concluded that, at doses up to internationally accepted standards for a maximum tolerated dose, PBO is not considered to be carcinogenic in the mouse or rat, thus leading to the conclusion that PBO is not carcinogenic to humans.

=== Developmental toxicity studies ===
PBO has been found to inhibit the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a critical regulator of brain and face development in all vertebrates, via antagonism of the protein Smoothened (SMO). PBO was found to be capable of causing dose-dependent brain and face malformations in mice exposed during early development, including the rare human birth defect holoprosencephaly. Even doses of PBO that did not cause overt holoprosencephaly associated facial abnormalities were found to cause subtle neuroanatomical defects, for which the cognitive or behavioral consequences are unknown.

An epidemiology study found that PBO exposure was correlated with dose-dependent reductions in neurocognitive development in 3-year old children.

=== Animal impacts ===
PBO is moderately to highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates, such as water fleas and shrimp. At lower, long-term doses, water flea reproduction was affected. PBO is highly toxic to amphibians in the tadpole stage.

== Exposure assessment ==

Given the extensive non-dietary use of PBO, manufacturers of PBO and marketers of PBO-containing products formed the Non-Dietary Exposure Task Force (NDETF) in 1996 to develop a long-term research program to more fully understand the phenomenon of human exposure to insecticides used in the home. Most of the studies were conducted with formulations of pyrethrins/PBO and synthetic pyrethroids/PBO, and focused on the indoor use of fogger and aerosol products. Carpet and vinyl flooring surfaces were selected because of their different physical and chemical properties, and because they represent a significant percentage of the floor coverings used in homes in North America.
While the focus of the NDETF effort was on total-release foggers, a study was also conducted to determine both dispersion (air levels) and deposition (on flooring) of pyrethrins/PBO resulting from the use of a hand held aerosol spray can. Potential direct exposure of the user was also measured. Air sampling from the breathing zone of the applicator and analysis of residues on cotton gloves was performed. This data was submitted to the United States EPA and was key to the agency’s comprehensive risk assessment for PBO.

== Risk assessment ==
The US EPA, in their re-registration eligibility decision, determined &quot;no risks of concern&quot; existed for householders mixing, loading, handling, or applying PBO-containing products.

<text>John Clifford Shaw (February 23, 1922 – February 9, 1991) was a systems programmer at the RAND Corporation. He is a coauthor of the first artificial intelligence program, the Logic Theorist, and was one of the developers of General Problem Solver (universal problem solver machine) and Information Processing Language (a programming language of the 1950s). Information Processing Language is considered the true &quot;father&quot; of the JOSS language. One of the most significant events that occurred in the programming was the development of the concept of list processing by Allen Newell, Herbert A.

<doc id="317109" wikidata="Q5467" url="?curid=317109" title="Exalted">
<text>Exalted is a high fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally published by White Wolf Publishing in July 2001. The game is currently in its third edition. It was originally created by Robert Hatch, Justin Achilli and Stephan Wieck, and was inspired by world mythologies and anime.

==Influences==
The setting is strongly influenced by Tanith Lee&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Flat Earth&quot;, Michael Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Hawkmoon&quot;, Lord Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot; and Yoshiaki Kawajiri&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;. Other influences include Glen Cook&#x27;s &quot;The Black Company&quot;; Sean Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Man&quot;, &quot;The Night Watch&quot;, and &quot;Galveston&quot;; Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the Bible, and Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

== System ==
The game uses ten-sided dice and a variation of the Storyteller System to arbitrate the action, and, as with many other RPGs, requires little beyond the rulebooks themselves, dice, pencil, and paper. The Exalted version of the rules were derived from the trilogy of White Wolf Publishing games &quot;Trinity&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Aeon&quot;), &quot;Aberrant&quot;, and &quot;Adventure!&quot; where the idea of a fixed target number of 7 or higher was first introduced.

Characters may be frequently presented with challenges that normal human beings, even within the context of the game, would find difficult, deadly, or simply impossible. However, as the chosen champions of greater powers, each Exalt possesses Charms, which may either enhance their natural capabilities or manifest as shows of great power. An Exalt with low-level Archery Charms might find her arrows hitting with preternatural accuracy, while greater faculty might allow her to shoot without difficulty to the edge of her vision, or turn a single arrow into a deadly rain of ammunition.

The Exalted frequently power their Charms with accumulated Essence, a universal energy that flows through and comprises Creation and other worlds. While normally their Essence recovered slowly through rest, in the first two editions they could also regain it more quickly by performing &quot;stunts&quot;, actions given special description and embellishment by the players. Stunts in Third Edition no longer regenerate Essence, but combat automatically causes Essence stores to refill quickly. However, stunts continue to exist, and their primary benefit—adding extra dice to the actions they describe, thus enhancing the possibility of success—remains.

== History ==
&quot;Exalted&quot; has mechanical and thematic similarities to White Wolf&#x27;s previous game series, the old World of Darkness, but exists in its own product line, called the Age of Sorrows. The game has a sales record on par with the company&#x27;s flagship title, &quot;&quot;, the second edition core rulebook achieving a sales ranking at No. 23,558 on Amazon.com with a 4.5-star mean user review rating based on 31 user reviews as of January 2019.

The initial advertisements for &quot;Exalted&quot; placed the Age of Sorrows as the pre-history of the old World of Darkness. Meanwhile, some oWoD supplements also supported this; the &quot;Hunter Apocrypha&quot; gave a vision of the past that said that Hunters gained their power from the broken shards of the souls of great heroes of a lost age, which seems to suggest that Hunters carry fragments of Solar Essences. Likewise, the &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; supplement gave a structure of the Wheel of Ages (mirrored in First Edition books as the Ages of Man) that seemed to accommodate the integration of &quot;Exalted&quot; and the classic World of Darkness, the former the First and Second Age, and the latter being the Fifth Age.

However, once the game was released such connections rapidly became uncertain: names and themes from the World of Darkness line run throughout the material, but rarely in a way that suggested a direct connection between one and the other. Per the commentary of multiple developers, the connections are deliberately tenuous, allowing players to be free to treat it as a prehistory or as its own world as it may suit their individual game. The similarities between &quot;Exalted&quot; and the Chronicles of Darkness are even weaker, primarily intersecting only where the Chronicles reused material from its predecessor. Second Edition briefly implies that its story is the prehistory of our &quot;own&quot; world on its back cover, but this idea is not explored in any depth beyond this; while the last book of Second Edition would posit a modernized world with the Exalted, it was clearly a technologically advanced version of Creation – the world of &quot;Exalted&quot; – rather than Earth. As of Third Edition, most references to the World of Darkness or Chronicles of Darkness are treated more as inspirational material rather than anything important for the history of the setting or needed to understand it.

&quot;Shards of the Exalted Dream&quot;, the final Second Edition product, was published in January 2012. Development of &quot;Exalted&quot;&#x27;s Third Edition was officially announced in October 2012. The Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for &quot;Exalted Third Edition&quot; ran in 2013 from May 9 to June 8, reaching its $60,000 funding goal within 18 minutes, raising a total of $684,755 and breaking Numenera&#x27;s record for the most funded tabletop RPG Kickstarter. Backers received the PDF in October 2015, POD in April 2016, and deluxe editions shipping to backers in March 2017.

Since then the game has continued to be produced by Onyx Path Publishing through a license with Paradox Interactive, produced as PDFs with print-on-demand options. In addition, major supplements have received crowdfunding for special print runs of deluxe editions, which also fund additional material from stretch goals and limited rewards. As of December 2024, the sourcebooks for Dragon-Blooded, Lunar Exalted, Exigents, and Sidereal Exalted have been crowdfunded and now on sale; Abyssal Exalted and Alchemical Exalted have been crowdfunded and are currently as pre-layout manuscripts to backers; and Infernal Exalted is currently in development and planned for a late 2025 or early 2026 crowdfunding campaign.

In December 2019, Onyx Path Publishing announced it would be producing and crowdfunding &quot;Exalted Essence,&quot; a streamlined version of the rules to introduce new players to &quot;Exalted&quot;&#x27;s setting and mechanics. The &quot;Exalted&quot; &quot;Essence&quot; core rulebook is explicitly not a new full edition, and is instead aimed to be compatible with the lore of Third Edition&#x27;s setting and supplements, while presenting mechanics to play all ten canonical Exalt types in a simplified manner. It launched its Kickstarter campaign in May 2021, finishing with $349,260 out of an initial goal of $35,000. The Print on Demand and PDF version went on sale in June 2023 and a crowdfunding campaign is planned for a player&#x27;s guide sometime in 2025.

== Promotions ==
In March 2008, White Wolf Publishing unveiled a promotion that would allow 2,500 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; players to exchange their copy of their &quot;3.5 Edition Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; for a copy of the &quot;Exalted Second Edition Core Rulebook&quot;. The promotion was called &quot;Graduate your Game&quot; and has received mixed reviews from fans of both games. The success of this promotion was not revealed.

== Setting ==

=== Background ===
The history of the setting begins with the Primordials: vast entities akin to Greek primordial deities or the Outer Gods of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s works, even going so far as to use similar epithets to the latter. They shaped Creation – a flat world of finite extent – from the primordial chaos, and placed the gods to watch over it.

In time, the gods decided to overthrow the Primordials, but were forbidden from taking arms against their makers. Instead, the most powerful of the gods imbued exceptional humans with their power (the titular Exalted) to fight for them; the blessings they bestowed (also known as Exaltations) would pass on to new champions with their death, allowing a new hero to rise when one fell. Upon victory, the gods retreated to the Heavenly city of Yu-Shan to oversee from on high, and left Creation to the Exalted and Humanity.

However, the Exalted suffer from &quot;the Great Curse&quot; uttered upon the dying breaths of the slain Primordials. The Solar Exalted—those empowered by the Unconquered Sun and mightiest among the Exalted—eventually grew decadent and corrupt from this influence, and were slaughtered in a massive insurrection known as the Usurpation by their servants and advisors. After the Usurpation, the majority of the Exaltations of the Solar Exalted were locked away, and an organization known as the Wyld Hunt was organized to kill all the others, and to drive the Lunar Exalted from the civilized lands of Creation.

During the intervening age, the Terrestrial Exalted became the rulers of the world, ruling in a shogunate. After the Great Contagion (a plague originating from the lands of the dead) and the Balorian Crusade (an invasion by the Fair Folk) wrought devastation across Creation, a young captain of the Dragon-Blooded armies gained access to powerful weapons of the First Age. With these, she saved Creation and then asserted her rulership over much of it, dubbing herself the Scarlet Empress. Nearly eight hundred years later—in the present day of the game—there are eleven Great Houses of the Realm, nearly all of whom claim direct descent from the Empress.

Five years prior to the default starting point of the game, the Empress vanished. By the present of the game it is believed she will not return, and the Realm stands on the brink of civil war. Simultaneously, the Solar Exaltations locked away have returned. With the Great Houses ignoring the threat of the Celestial Exalted to position themselves to take control of the Realm, the number of Solar Exalted in Creation is growing. Thus, the backdrop to the setting sees the newly arisen Solars (among various other heroes and villains) struggling to survive long enough to make their mark upon the fate of Creation, for good or for ill.

The flat world of Creation is the primary setting of &quot;Exalted&quot;. Creation has two continents, the Blessed Isle and an unnamed super-continent which covers the northern, eastern and southern edges of Creation, populated by many nations and tribes, with the settled regions along the inner coast of this super-continent being known collectively as the threshold. The Blessed Isle is located in the center of Creation. The Realm rules the Blessed Isle and its proximate archipelago directly, and indirectly rules numerous tributary states known as satrapies along the threshold.

Surrounding Creation is the infinite ocean of pure chaos known as the Wyld. The cosmology of &quot;Exalted&quot; also includes the Underworld, the celestial city of Yu-Shan, the demon realm of Malfeas, and the machine world of Autochthonia.

=== Types of Exalts ===
At the core of the setting, there are several different types of Exalted, any type of which could play the role of protagonist or antagonist of the game. The Exalted of Creation can be divided into two categories: Terrestrial Exalted and Celestial Exalted. Celestial Exalted, being the chosen of the Celestial Incarnae, are significantly more powerful than Terrestrial Exalted, and can live for millennia, but their numbers are limited by a fixed number of Exaltations passing from mortal life to mortal life at any given time. Terrestrial Exalted are the Chosen of the Elemental Dragons; while less powerful, the Dragon-Blooded inherit Exaltation from their ancestors.

The Abyssal, Alchemical, Getimian, and Infernal Exalted technically fall outside of the two categories, though their power level is comparable to that of Celestial Exalted. Liminal Exalted and Exigents also fall out outside of these categories and are normally on par with Terrestrial Exalted, although some Exigents can manifest power comparable to the Celestial Exalted. A brief synopsis of each type is given here, organized by how these Exalts are often arranged in texts for much of the line&#x27;s history, followed by Exalts who appeared in later texts in order of appearance.

Most types of Exalted have certain collective predispositions toward or against other Exalt types by culture, and may be viewed differently by the various mortals of Creation. Centuries of Terrestrial hegemony and propaganda play a part in this: the Dragon-Blooded and their world-spanning empire are often seen as demigods and heroes, for instance, while the Lunar Exalted are often seen as monstrous and dangerous.

==== Solar Exalted (Chosen of the Unconquered Sun, Lawgivers) ====
The default protagonists of &quot;Exalted&quot; and the champions of the chief of the gods, a being known as the Unconquered Sun. There are five castes of Solar Exalted: Dawn (warriors and generals), Zenith (priest-kings of the Unconquered Sun), Twilight (scholars and sorcerers), Night (spies and assassins) and Eclipse (ambassadors and diplomats).

Solars are regarded as monstrous demons by much of the mortal world due to centuries of propaganda by the Realm.

The nature of Solar Charms tends to express itself instead through human excellence taken to superhuman extremes, and as such their raw prowess in most skills easily exceeds any of the others.

==== Lunar Exalted (Chosen of Luna, Stewards) ====
Presented as the most anarchistic and chaotic of the Exalted. In the sourcebooks, they are often referred to as cunning shapeshifters, skilled fighters, and capable generals.

Within the game&#x27;s history, they were very tightly bound to the First Age Solars. While many stood and died beside their Solar friends and spouses in the Usurpation, others fled to the edges of Creation and remade themselves to fight a long war against the Dragon-Blooded. Lunars now follow at best a loose tribal hierarchy and often ritually tattoo each other to protect themselves from the warping effects of the Wyld.

Second Edition materials detailed the Lunar Exalted&#x27;s subversive influence on Creation&#x27;s societies and revealed the Thousand Streams River Project, a complicated system of social engineering designed to create self-sufficient human societies that do not require Exalted leadership to function. Several major societies within the game were declared the results of centuries of subtle, behind-the-scenes guidance, with varying degrees of success.

Third Edition again changes aspects of the Lunar Exalted. Lunars were not inherently linked to Solar Exalted and instead early in the First Age the two groups went to war to settle who would have greater hegemony in Creation. The conflict was ended with negotiated peace and mutual cooperation instead, sealed with ritualized marriages that linked most Solar and Lunar Exalted together into supernatural bonds. When the First Age ended, the Lunars turned their attention to the Terrestrial Shogunate by fighting a long term insurgency against the Dragon-Blooded and Sidereal hegemony. Their castes were reforged by the Lunars themselves to better reflect the needs of the world they now found themselves in. The Silver Pact exists as a support network of Lunars seeking to destroy the successor-states of the Shogunate and protect Lunars from reprisal of the Wyld Hunt and other Lunar enemies.

==== Sidereal Exalted (Chosen of the Five Maidens, Viziers) ====
These Celestial Exalted are few, yet are described as major players in the fate of Creation. Sidereals are peerless martial artists and excel at foreseeing and manipulating fate. They are often presented as secret agents of the Bureau of Fate of the Celestial City of Yu-Shan, the home of the gods, directing events in the mortal world from behind the scenes.

They were the viziers, prophets and cunning advisers of the First Age. Toward the end of the First Age, a prophecy came to them that warned that without action, Creation would fall to darkness. Seeking to save the world, the Sidereals looked into the future and saw two options: attempt to reform of their maddening kings, or destroy the Solar Exalted and raise up the Dragon-Blooded in their place. The Sidereals, possibly under the effects of the Great Curse laid upon them by the Neverborn, elected the path that offered a guaranteed future for Creation. As such, they orchestrated the end of the First Age, known as the Great Usurpation.

Sidereals slip from the minds of those who meet them, mortal and Exalt alike, which can be beneficial to Sidereal characters or harmful, depending on their intended goals as player characters and non-player characters. Some unpredicted events prior to the &quot;present&quot; setting of Exalted, such as the Great Contagion, have jarred their faith in their precognitive abilities. Meanwhile, the loss of the Scarlet Empress, their secret ally at the top of the Scarlet Dynasty, has greatly weakened their influence.

In the present, a growing rift between the Bronze Faction (which supports the Dragon-Blooded hegemony) and the Gold Faction (which backs the newly returned Solars) renders the Sidereal Exalted uncertain of their future.

Some aspects of Sidereal Exalted have been reframed in Third Edition. There is no longer a mention of a Great Prophecy, and instead the Sidereals who conspired to perform the Solar Purge did so under presumption it was the best option based on what information they had. In addition, the relationship between the Factions has been reframed, with the Bronze Faction being more about status quo (which the Realm and Dragon-Blooded were critical to preserving) and whose leadership are those who supported the original Solar Purge. Meanwhile, the Gold Faction is more about reformation of the world (which Solar support is a notably powerful clique within that Faction), rather than support of Solar Exalted in themselves.

==== Terrestrial Exalted (Chosen of the Elemental Dragons, Dragon-Blooded) ====
There are five elemental aspects to the Dragon-Blooded: Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Wood. In the history of Exalted, they were the elite infantry and servants to the rest of the Exalted in the First Age. This is reframed in 3e to be more the officers and champions of the armies comprising most of humanity during the Divine Revolution, and later allies to the Celestial Exalted and local nobility throughout the First Age. They are less powerful than other types of Exalted, but most of their strength lies in their inheritance – rather than being chosen by a god, the Dragon-Blooded have the potential to share their Exaltation through their bloodline. With their comparatively massive numbers, along with the help and guidance of the Sidereal Exalted, they were able to overthrow the Solar Exalted at the height of their power and end the First Age.

The most prevalent Dragon-Blooded in Creation make up the ruling class of the Realm, currently the most powerful empire in Creation. The state-sanctioned faith known as the Immaculate Order paints the Solar and Lunar Exalted as dangerous Anathema who will bring ruin to the world if allowed to exist. Because of this, the Realm organizes the Wyld Hunt, which actively seeks out dangers to the Realm (such &quot;Anathema&quot; include many other types of Exalted, rogue gods, and the Fair Folk) and destroys them. This practice had effectively kept the Solars from rising to power again since the end of the First Age, but has faltered with the recent disappearance of the Scarlet Empress and the subsequent power struggle among the Great Houses.

The ruling Dragon-Blooded of the Realm are made up of the eleven Great Houses. Most houses were founded by and named after one of the Scarlet Empress&#x27;s Exalted offspring, though at least two are descended from the Empress&#x27;s late husbands and consorts, and a few are named after people the Empress legally adopted as her children.

==== Abyssal Exalted (Chosen of the Void, Deathknights, Death&#x27;s Lawgivers) ====
Loyal servants of the Deathlords, the Abyssal castes are a dark reflection of their Solar counterparts; Dusk (soldiers, generals, and martial champions), Midnight (priests and leaders), Daybreak (scholars and artisans), Day (assassins and spies), and Moonshadow (bureaucrats and diplomats).

In the present of &quot;Exalted&quot;, the Neverborn sow their revenge from beyond the grave through their Deathlord servants. The source materials, primarily the second-edition sourcebook &quot;The Manual of Exalted Power: Abyssals&quot;, present the Deathlords as the vengeful ghosts of First Age Solars slaughtered in the Usurpation. They have varied goals, but most strive not to conquer or corrupt Creation, save as a path to the Neverborn&#x27;s desire: the complete destruction of existence.

The greatest agents of the Deathlords in the world of the living are the Abyssal Exalted, also known as Deathknights: dark reflections of the Solar Exalted. They field vast undead armies, bolstered by ancient knowledge long since lost to the living but still readily available among the lingering dead, and a powerful form of magic known as necromancy. Several sourcebooks present the Abyssals and the Deathlords as having a tentative foothold in Creation, representing a grave threat.

==== Alchemical Exalted (Chosen of Autochthon, Champions, Colossi, Patropoli/Matropoli/Metropoli) ====
 Creations made from clay and the Magical Materials, built in the world of Autochthonia. They were introduced in the supplement &quot;Time of Tumult&quot;. Alchemicals serve the Great Maker Autochthon, a Primordial who assisted the gods by sharing the secret of Exaltation with them. The Champions are infused with the souls of dead Autochthonian heroes, serving as protectors of a parallel world made up of the body of Autochthon himself, and enforce the will of its theocratic government. They divide themselves into six castes according to which material was mainly used in their construction. Instead of wielding Essence directly and using their Charms in a &quot;magical&quot; fashion like other Exalted do, the Alchemicals have Charms &quot;installed&quot; like peripheral parts. As Alchemical Exalted grow in power, they also increase in size, eventually physically joining with Autochthon and forming living, sapient cities.

In First and Second Edition the Alchemicals are not subject to the Great Curse, as they did not fight in the Primordial War. In gameplay, in place of curse-driven insanity, they have a Clarity track which measures their psychological distance from humanity. Those Alchemicals who have been infected with Autochthon&#x27;s illness have a Dissonance track instead, measuring their madness, corruption, and drive to violate boundaries, becoming Apostates. 

In Third Edition Autochthon created the Alchemical Exalted originally to help show the gods the potential of the process and his own commitment to aiding them in their cause. As a result, some Alchemicals remained in Creation in a dormant state or may have been made through rare confluence of events. Resonance still exists Third Edition, but is re-framed as the manifestation of the Great Curse in the Alchemical Exalted, with Exaltation itself being what&#x27;s cursed. Apostasy is still possible, but is not presented as a player-facing option in Third Edition. 

==== Infernal Exalted (Chosen of the Yozis, Akuma, Green Sun Princes) ====
The Yozis — the Primordials who were overthrown but did not die — created the Infernal Exalted from fifty stolen Essences of Solar Exalts. While First Edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until the Second Edition&#x27;s &quot;Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals&quot; (April 2009).

The Infernals also known as Green Sun Princes have the full resources of the demon realm at their disposal, along with numerous Yozi cults which already exist in creation, and learn the transformative Charms of the Yozis themselves. It is implied that despite currently reveling in their power, the vast majority of Infernal Exalted will grow disillusioned with the alien Yozis and ultimately go rogue. The Infernals&#x27; Primordial power gives them the potential to grow into new Titans themselves, not bound by the same shortness of vision their current patrons possess.

In First and Second Edition Exalts could make pacts with the Yozis, often facilitated through the acquirng of forbidden text known as the &quot;Broken-Winged Crane&quot;. These were known as Akuma. They often gained notable power for their pledges to Hell, namely in Merits, additional access to magical power, and Yozi Charms in the case of 2e. In exchange their free will was destroyed, and they became slaves to the Yozis.

The presentation of Infernal Exalted has changed notably in Third Edition. They are first detailed in &quot;Exalted Essence&quot; and receive a prestige spread in &quot;Crucible of Legend&quot;. While remaining Chosen of the Yozis, they do not use Yozi Charms, instead drawing heavily on them for their themes and inspiration. They are Chosen from individuals who see themselves as wronged or oppressed in some fashion, justifiably or not. With the Yozis forever trapped in Hell, they hope that by corrupting the Chosen of the gods to their power they can inflict revenge on a Creation that has rejected them. Their Castes are named for the positions of celestial bodies and roughly correspond to the Solar Castes, though focused on how the Exalt was put down by the world: Azimuth from vicitms of violence and war, Ascendants by those considered expendable or impure, Horizons from those denied knowledge, Nadirs from those subject to imprisonment either literally or metaphorically, and Penumbra by those subjected to the caprice of those in power.

Akuma have not come up in context of Third Edition yet, but developer statements imply it is no longer a singular mechanical implmentation and instead a descriptor for Exalted infernalists as a whole.

==== Liminal Exalted (Chosen of the Dark Mother) ====
Liminal Exalted first appeared in &quot;Masters of Jade&quot; in late Second Edition without being fully detailed. They became more defined as of the &quot;Exalted Third Edition&quot; core rules and have since appeared throughout the line, with their own full sourcebook forthcoming. They are first presented as playable in &quot;Exalted Essence.&quot; (June 2023)

The Liminals &quot;stand at the border between life and death, humanity and monstrosity&quot;. They are created when someone attempts to bring another person back from death; resurrection is explicitly impossible in Exalted, but some will still try. On occasion, this attempt draws the attention of some other power that raises the corpse to life again. The new Liminal possesses the memories of the body that she wears, but does not possess the same soul, and thus does not have the same personality. Like the Dragon-Blooded, they are divided among five aspects—Breath, Blood, Flesh, Marrow, and Soil—depending on the motives of the person who created them.

==== Exigents (Chosen of the Little Gods) ====
Exigents are new kind of Exalt introduced in Third Edition. They are first showcased in the &quot;Exalted Third Edition&quot; rulebook, and detailed in full in &quot;Exigents: Out of the Ashes&quot; (May 2024), which includes information on them, how they are created, as well as four ready-to-play Exigents (the Strawmaiden, the Puppeteer, Architects, and the Sovereigns of Uluiru).

Exigents are the Chosen of the Little Gods, which is any god lesser than the Incarna. The secret of Exaltation is not known to gods normally, and the price needed to Exalt is taxing enough that it is unlikely many gods could do it anyways. A deity in great need can petition to the Unconquered Sun to grant them a portion of the Flame of Exigence — a wonder obtained by him and the other Incarna in the early days of the Divine Revolution — which acts as a catalyst allowing a god to create a Chosen. it still diminishes the god in some fashion, and many weaker deities are destroyed by the process.

Exigents themselves are often singular, unique Exaltations that do not persist after the Chosen dies, though this can vary. Some are inherited like Celestial Exalted. Others have an artifact or familiar of some sort which is inherited by each Exaltation. Others are Exalted by a source that has some means to Exalt more Chosen of that particular sort. The Flame of Exigence can also be traded or stolen, resulting in illicit Exigents not fitting the purpose of the original divine petition. Sometimes multiple gods participate in the creation of an Exaltation with the Exigence, which can result in patchwork Exalts with conflicting and often strained natures as a result.

Most Exigents are on par with the Terrestrial Exalted, though a few stand on par with Celestial Exalts, though the god who Chooses does not impact this. The Strawmaiden Janest is on par with Celestial Exalted despite being Chosen of a field god, while Sovereigns remain Terrestrial despite the source of their Exaltation incorporating the blood of the dead Incarna of the Aurora.

Exigents serve as a way to introduce unique, custom Exalts that don&#x27;t fit within one of the established categories of Exalted, or which draw on the unique themes of particular gods of the setting that would not be reflective of the way the other Exalted might but don&#x27;t justify the setting needs of introducing a whole new Exalt host.

==== Getimian Exalted (Chosen from Discarded Destinies) ====
Getimian Exalted are an Exalt type introduced in Third Edition. They are hinted at early on but are treated as another full Exalt sort starting with &quot;The Realm.&quot; They appear as a playable Exalt type in &quot;Exalted: Essence&quot;. (June 2023) They also receive a prestige spread and deeper information on their place in the setting in &quot;Crucible of Legends&quot;.

The Getimian Exalted are heroes whose destinies could have changed the world, but instead were never born as Heaven discarded those destinies in favor of another path. Originally created by the titans Oramus and Sacheverell during the Divine Revolution, they were deemed too costly to use and hidden away. The rogue Sidereal Exalt Rakan Thulio rediscovered their Exaltations, and brought them into the world again to serve in his War Against Heaven.

Getimians find themselves appearing in Creation having never existed before, remembering a different Creation where they were notable heroes, called their Origin. The Getimian Origin is explicitly not an alternative universe that existed but only one which could have been. The Getimian did not exist until the moment they Exalt, and their memories are of a world that simply never was. Current writers have often used the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as an example of the Getimian condition. Their four Castes are named for the four seasons and draw on what the notable way the Getimian impacted their world as a mortal: Springs brought beauty, Summers brought conquest, Autumns brought sacrifice, and Winters brought order.

The Getimian Exalted have Essence split into two pools: Still and Flowing, and unlike the other Exalted types, their Charms interact with their separate pools in different ways: Some of their Charms can only be powered by one or the other, or cause different effects depending on which one is used. Their magic often involves forms of spatial manipulation, internal and external alchemy, and bringing into reality aspects of their Origin.

=== Other magical beings ===
Alongside the various types of Exalts found in Creation, there are also other magical creatures that use the same Essence that Exalts use to power their magical effects. The following are the most prominent types of magical beings.

; Behemoths
: Behemoths are unique, immortal monsters. There are three broad categories of behemoths: &quot;Primordial Behemoths&quot;, created by the Primordials in the Time of Glory before the Primordial War. &quot;Wyld Behemoths&quot; appear as monsters under the control of Fair Folk, but they are not truly separate beings from their masters, and are merely the aggressive tendencies of powerful Fair Folk come to life. &quot;Undead behemoths&quot;, called hekatonkheires in First and Second Edition, include Primordial behemoths killed during that Primordial War/Divine Revolution and persist in the Underworld, as well as the remnants of the souls of the Neverborn and manifestations of their nightmares. 

; Dragon Kings
: The Dragon Kings are not Exalted; they are supernatural creatures offered as a player character type. The Dragon Kings are dinosaur-like beings of great power. Dragon Kings are sworn in allegiance to their creator, the Unconquered Sun, and can remember their past lives with great clarity. Although they once ruled Creation, the majority of their perpetually-reincarnating souls were annihilated during the war against the Primordials. After the First Age ended in war and disease, what remained of their civilization collapsed. They still exist in the Second Age, though hidden in the farthest corners of Creation. Rules for playing Dragon Kings are presented in the &quot;Exalted Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; in First Edition, the &quot;Scroll of the Fallen Races&quot; in Second Edition, and &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; for Essence Edition (forthcoming).

; Fair Folk
: Like the Dragon Kings, they are an alternative player character type to the Exalted. They know themselves by their own word, raksha; however the superstitious in Creation, rightly fearing that to name them is to invoke them, call them the Fair Folk with the hope of flattering and placating them. In one sense, they are very similar to the Primordials: primeval beings whose existences precede and are not bound by the physical reality of Creation. They are natives of the Wyld, which they call Rakshastan – the place that exists between Creation and the Unshaped Chaos.

: The Fair Folk prey upon mortal souls and do a brisk slave trade with The Guild, a powerful economic organization in Creation. The Unshaped are the most powerful of their number, but lack the means to stabilize themselves by assimilating the personhood of mortals and as such are incapable of existing in Creation for any great duration. Rules for playing Fair Folk are presented in &quot;Exalted: The Fair Folk&quot; in First Edition; Second Edition rules are included in &quot;Graceful Wicked Masques: The Fair Folk.&quot;

; God-Blooded

: Refers to, as a collective whole, offspring of a mortal or animal and a magical being, or the mortal offspring of two magical beings, in which case they take after the more powerful of the two. The resulting offspring bears traces of its mystical parentage. According to the authors, they stand somewhere between divinity and mortality: less than Exalted, but more than human. Those with awakened Essence can purchase the same types of Charms as their supernatural parent, though their power is limited by a low Permanent Essence trait and a small Essence pool.

: There are several subtypes of God-Blooded, mostly named for their supernatural parentage: God-Blooded are the children of gods and elementals, Demon-Blooded are the offspring of demons, Ghost-Blooded are the children of ghosts using powerful Charms to help them reproduce with mortals, and Half-Caste are the children of powerful Exalts (although exceedingly rare). The Fae-Blooded are the children of a union between the raksha and mortals. The Mountain Folk can also produce God-Blooded offspring, but there is no specific term for them. Rules for playing God-Blooded characters are presented in the &quot;Exalted Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; in First Edition, and &quot;Scroll of Heroes&quot; in Second Edition.

; Mountain Folk

: Also known as the Jadeborn, creatures of the Great Maker, Autochthon: when Creation was initially formed by the Primordials, some among the Unshaped were incorporated into the substance of the created world. Sensing that these other, native intelligences of Chaos had been snuffed out in the Creation of inanimate elements, Autochthon took pity on them. Salvaging whatever it could discern of their prior selves, Autochthon resurrected them – still formed of the earthen materials they had calcified into, but &quot;alive&quot;, and with at least a glimmering memory of the intelligent entities they had once been.

: The Mountain Folk, like many of the Exalted, are divided into Castes: Artisans, Warriors, and Workers. The vast majority of the Mountain Folk are Unenlightened – limited in intelligence, creativity, and supernatural power. A small minority of Workers and Warriors—as well as the entire Artisan Caste—are Enlightened, with much greater creativity as well as both mundane and supernatural potential. Mountain Folk society is ruled by the Artisan Caste, who make up the nobility, with Unenlightened Warriors and Workers making up the commoners and Enlightened Warriors and Workers occupying an intermediate position. Rules for playing the Mountain Folk are presented in First Edition&#x27;s &quot;Exalted: The Fair Folk&quot; and Second Edition&#x27;s &quot;Scroll of the Fallen Races&quot;.

; Spirits

: Spirits are divided into four broad categories: demons, elementals, ghosts, and gods. With the exception of elementals, spirits are naturally immaterial, generally require Charms to materialize in Creation, and will reform when killed unless some supernatural effect prevents them from doing so. Rules for playing ghosts in First Edition are presented in &quot;Exalted: The Abyssals&quot;, and rules for Second Edition are presented in &quot;The Books of Sorcery, Vol. V: The Roll of Glorious Divinity II: Ghosts &amp; Demons&quot;. Rules for playing elementals and gods are presented in &quot;The Books of Sorcery, Vol. IV: The Roll of Glorious Divinity I: Gods &amp; Elementals&quot;.

:;Yozis and Demons
:: The Yozis are exiled, imprisoned and twisted Primordials. As the makers of the world and the gods, they are at once grandiose beings and complex pantheons: Each Primordial has multiple souls, which are independent sapient beings in their own right and possess their own sapient spiritual fragments. These souls, and the entities which they craft, birth, or otherwise create, are the demons of Exalted.

:: Due to the terms of the Yozis&#x27; surrender, all demons can be summoned and bound by a powerful enough sorcerer.

:; Elementals
:: Elementals maintain Creation, and with a few exceptions, embody one of the five elements: air, earth, fire, water or wood. Elementals are naturally material, requiring Charms to dematerialize, and with a few exceptions, cannot reform when slain. Unlike other spirits, their growth is largely unrestricted. The most powerful elementals are the lesser and greater elemental dragons. Elementals are generally outranked by gods of similar power. While sorcerers can summon and bind demons through sorcery, the elementals conjured through a similar spell are brought into being whole-cloth, and frequently cease to exist at the end of their binding.

:: In First and Second Editions, Autochthonia had its own elements and related elementals which embody one of the machine world&#x27;s elements: crystal, metal, oil, lightning or steam, and cannot be summoned through sorcery. In Third Edition, Autochthon used incorporated Creation&#x27;s elements in the design of his world. These elementals can be created by sorcery like those found in Creation, but will usually reflect the aesthetics and themes of Autocthonia. 

:; Ghosts
:: The most common type of ghosts, referred to as &quot;ghosts&quot; or &quot;the dead&quot;, are the &quot;hun&quot; or higher souls of mortals who have refused to pass into Lethe and reincarnation due to their attachment to their mortal lives. These ghosts are much weaker than Exalted, and they can only respire Essence in the Underworld and Shadowlands. &quot;Hungry ghosts&quot; generally come into existence due to betrayal, vengeance or a traumatic death. Initially, a hungry ghost includes both the higher soul and the &quot;po&quot;, or lower soul, but the &quot;hun&quot; soon moves on, leaving the hungry ghost largely mindless. Unlike other ghosts, hungry ghosts are naturally material in Creation at night. &quot;Nephwracks&quot; are ghosts who have been corrupted by the Neverborn. Unlike uncorrupted ghosts, they are capable of using necromancy. The &quot;Deathlords&quot; are thirteen ghosts of powerful Solar Exalted who have been empowered by the Neverborn, and although they are not technically Exalted, they have access to Abyssal Charms. &quot;Spectres&quot;, also known as &quot;plasmics&quot;, are bizarre creatures spawned by the nightmares of the Neverborn. The category of &quot;Hekatonkhire&quot; includes the ghosts of demons, devas and Primordial behemoths, as well as the manifested nightmares of the Neverborn. The &quot;Neverborn&quot; are the ghosts of slain Primordials. Immensely powerful, they are difficult to rouse from their slumber, and their power seems largely constrained to the Labyrinth. Only mundane ghosts and Hekatonkhire can be summoned through necromancy, and only mundane ghosts can be summoned through sorcery.

:; Gods
:: Most gods are members of the Celestial Order, which is stratified into two divisions: the Celestial Court, composed of gods of concepts, and the Terrestrial Bureaucracy, made up of the gods of physical objects and locations. Technically, all members of the Celestial Court outrank all members of the Terrestrial Bureaucracy. In practice, Terrestrial courts are largely independent.
:: Outside of the Celestial Order, there are also the unemployed gods whose domains have been usurped or destroyed, rogue gods who have abandoned their duties, and forbidden gods who have been exiled due to madness, an abhorrent nature or because they sided with the Primordials.

:Other Spirits
:: Outside of the above categories exist various other sorts of spirits, some which defy classification. These include the souls of the free Primordials Gaia and Autocthon (the latter of which manifest as the various machine spirits within Autocthonia), as well as the animal avatar champions uplifted by Gaia, and the pattern spiders which operate the Loom of Fate. 

=== Essence ===
Essence is the mystical force which the Exalted and gods manipulate to gain their supernatural powers, as well as the energy that forms all things. Within the game, the mystical force &quot;Essence&quot; is always capitalized to distinguish from other uses of the word.

=== Magical Materials ===
The Magical Materials are used to forge artifacts and weapons. Each material is associated with a type of Exalted, as well as one of the Castes of Alchemical Exalted, who are partially constructed from that material. These materials are all easily enchanted, and each one resonates with a particular type of Exalted. This resonance makes any item that is both constructed from one of the Magical Materials and attuned to an Exalt&#x27;s anima preternaturally deft and sure in that Exalt&#x27;s hands. It also gives the Exalt access to the powers of any hearthstone mounted on the item. Third Edition expands on this with the concept of Evocations, Charms tied to a given artifact based on its material construction, legend, and Exalted resonance. Some Evocations gain additional affects when the Exalt wielding them are of the Resonant material, while the Evocation may not work at its full effect if the Exalt is Dissonant with that material.

; Jade : The most common Magical Material, and associated with the most numerous of the Exalted, the Dragon-Blooded. There are five colors of jade which correspond to one of the five elements of Creation: blue jade resonates with Air, white with Earth, red with Fire, black with Water, and green with Wood.

; Starmetal : The rarest of the Magical Materials, forged from meteors. In later First Edition, these meteors were a result of the execution of gods in Heaven. This is not retained in the &quot;Exalted Second Edition&quot; core rulebook, but later re-introduced supplement &quot;Oadenol&#x27;s Codex&quot;. Third Edition again discards the need to kill gods to create starmetal, instead describing it as the result of concentrated Essence from the sky and constellations. Like its wielders, the Sidereal Exalted, starmetal re-weaves fate and involves itself with divine functions.

; Moonsilver : Lunar Exalted consider this metal to be a gift from their patron, Luna. It must be harvested by moonlight, using no crafted tools, forged at night and cooled only with water that has never seen the sun. Like the protean Lunars, moonsilver can shift into new forms easily.

; Soulsteel : This metal is made from human souls and the substance of the Labyrinth of the Underworld. It is jet black, and agonized faces of the souls it contains can be seen moving and screaming in the metal. Unsurprisingly, this material is used almost exclusively by the Abyssal Exalted. Soulsteel weapons draw upon the forces of death and the underworld.

; Orichalcum : A magical form of gold used primarily by the Solar Exalted, though it has associations with the Dragon Kings and in Third Edition the Infernal Exalted as well. Orichalcum is rarely found in pure deposits; usually, it is created out of gold that has been heated by lava and sunlight reflected from mirrors of occult design.

; Adamant : A form of magical diamond, adamant is super-solid crystal that is refined down to the sharpest substance known. It is largely present within the body of the Primordial Autochthon, but was also known in Creation during the First Age. This material is used primarily by the Alchemical Exalted, though the Exalted of the First Age occasionally made items out of the material.

<text>Contemporary worship music (CWM), also known as praise and worship music, is a defined genre of Christian music used in contemporary worship. It has developed over the past 60 years and is stylistically similar to pop music. The songs are frequently referred to as &quot;praise songs&quot; or &quot;worship songs&quot; and are typically led by a &quot;worship band&quot; or &quot;praise team&quot;, with either a guitarist or pianist leading. It has become a common genre of music sung in many churches, particularly in charismatic or non-denominational Protestant churches with some Roman Catholic congregations incorporating it into the Mass as well.

==History and development==

In the early 1950s, the Taizé Community in France started to attract youths from several religious denominations with worship hymns based on modern melodies.

In the mid-20th century, Christian Unions in university environments hosted evangelistic talks and the Universalists and Unitarians, the two youth groups took final steps toward merger at a convention held and in 1953 the two youth groups formed the Liberal Religious Youth.
Amateur musicians from these groups began playing Christian music in a popular idiom. Some Christians felt that the church needed to break from its stereotype as being structured, formal and dull to appeal to the younger generation. By borrowing the conventions of popular music, the antithesis of this stereotype, the church restated the claims of the Bible through Christian lyrics, and thus sent the message that Christianity was not outdated or irrelevant. In 1964 UK gospel pop group &quot;The Joystrings&quot; were one of the first Christian pop groups to appear on television, in Salvation Army uniform, playing Christian beat music.

Churches began to adopt some of these songs and the styles for corporate worship. These early songs for communal singing were characteristically simple. &quot;Youth Praise&quot;, published in 1966, was one of the first and most famous collections of these songs and was compiled and edited by Michael Baughen and published by the Jubilate Group.

As of the early 1990s, songs such as &quot;Lord, I Lift Your Name on High&quot;, &quot;Shine, Jesus, Shine&quot; and &quot;Shout to the Lord&quot; had been accepted in many churches. Integrity Media, Maranatha! Music and Vineyard were already publishing newer styles of music. Supporters of traditional worship hoped the newer styles were a fad, while younger people cited , &quot;Sing to the Lord a new song&quot;. Prior to the late 1990s, many felt that Sunday morning was a time for hymns, and young people could have their music on the other six days. A &quot;modern worship renaissance&quot; helped make it clear any musical style was acceptable if true believers were using it to praise God. The changes resulted from the &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; recordings by the band Delirious?, the Passion Conferences and their music, the Exodus project of Michael W. Smith, and the band Sonicflood. Contemporary worship music became an integral part of Contemporary Christian music.

More recently songs are displayed using projectors on screens at the front of the church, and this has enabled greater physical freedom, and a faster rate of turnover in the material being sung. Important propagators of CWM over the past 25 years include Vineyard Music, Hillsong Worship, Bethel Music, Elevation Worship, Jesus Culture and Soul Survivor.

==Theology and lyrics==
As CWM is closely related to the charismatic movement, the lyrics and even some musical features reflect its theology. In particular the charismatic movement is characterised by its emphasis on the Holy Spirit, through a personal encounter and relationship with God, that can be summed up in agape love.

Lyrically, the informal, sometimes intimate, language of relationship is employed. The terms &#x27;You&#x27; and &#x27;I&#x27; are used rather than &#x27;God&#x27; and &#x27;we&#x27;, and lyrics such as, &#x27;I, I&#x27;m desperate for You&#x27;, and &#x27;Hungry I come to You for I know You satisfy, I am empty but I know Your love does not run dry&#x27; both exemplify the similarity of the lyrics of some CWM to popular love songs. Slang is used on occasion (for example &#x27;We wanna see Jesus lifted high&#x27;) and imperatives (&#x27;Open the eyes of my heart, Lord, I want to see You&#x27;), demonstrating the friendly, informal terms charismatic theology encourages for relating to God personally. Often a physical response is included in the lyrics (&#x27;So we raise up holy hands&#x27;; &#x27;I will dance, I will sing, to be mad for my king&#x27;). This couples with the use of drums and popular rhythm in the songs to encourage full body worship.

The metaphorical language of the lyrics is subjective, and therefore does risk being misinterpreted; this emphasis on personal encounter with God does not always balance with intellectual understanding.

Just as in secular, popular and rock music, relationships and feelings are central topics, so in CWM, association to a personal relationship with God and free expression are emphasised.

As in traditional hymnody, some images, such as captivity and freedom, life and death, romance, power and sacrifice, are employed to facilitate relationship with God.

=== The modern hymn movement ===
Beginning in the 2010s, contemporary worship music with a distinctly theological lyric focus blending hymns and worship songs with contemporary rhythms &amp; instrumentation, began to emerge, primarily in the Baptist, Reformed, and more traditional non-denominational branches of Protestant Christianity. Artists in the modern hymn movement include well-known groups such as Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty and Sovereign Grace Music, as well as solo artists such as Matt Papa, Enfield (Hymn Sessions) and Aaron Keyes. By the late 2010s, the movement had gained sizable traction in many churches, streaming services and other areas in culture.

==Musical identity==
Because, in common with hymns, such music is sung communally, there can be a practical and theological emphasis on its accessibility, to enable every member of the congregation to participate in a corporate act of worship. This often manifests in simple, easy to learn melodies, in a mid-vocal range, repetition, familiar chord progressions and a restricted harmonic palette. Unlike hymns, the music notation may primarily be based around the chords, with the keyboard score being secondary.

At more charismatic services, members of the congregation may harmonise freely during worship songs, perhaps singing in tongues (see glossolalia), and the worship leader seeks to be &#x27;led by the Holy Spirit&#x27;. There may also be role of improvisation, flowing from one song to the next and inserting musical material from one song into another.

==Performance==

===The worship band===

There is no fixed band set-up for playing CWM, but most have a lead singer and lead guitarist or keyboard player. Their role is to indicate the tone, structure, pace and volume of the worship songs, and perhaps even construct the order or content during the time of worship. Some larger churches are able to employ paid worship leaders, and some have attained fame by worship leading, blurring contemporary worship music with Christian rock, though the role of the band in a worship service, leading and enabling the congregation in praise normally contrasts that of performing a Christian concert. In CWM today there will often be three or four singers with microphones, a drum kit, a bass guitar, one or two guitars, keyboard and possibly other, more orchestral instruments, such as a flute or violin. There has been a shift within the genre towards using amplified instruments and voices, again paralleling popular music, though some churches play the same songs with simpler or acoustic instrumentation.

===The role of technology===
Technological advances have played a significant role in the development of CWM. In particular the use of projectors means that the song repertoire of a church is not restricted to those in a song book. Songs and styles go in trends. The internet has increased accessibility, enabling anyone to see lyrics and guitar chords for many worship songs, and download MP3 tracks. This has also played a part in the globalisation of much CWM. Some churches, such as Hillsong, Bethel and Vineyard, have their own publishing companies, and there is a thriving Christian music business which parallels that of the secular world, with recording studios, music books, CDs, MP3 downloads and other merchandise. The consumer culture surrounding CWM has prompted both criticism and praise, and as Pete Ward deals with in his book &quot;Selling Worship&quot;, no advance is without both positive and negative repercussions.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms include Gary Parrett&#x27;s concern that the volume of this music drowns out congregational participation, and therefore makes it a performance. He quotes Ephesians 5:19, in which Paul the Apostle tells the church in Ephesus to be &#x27;speaking to one another with psalms, hymns and songs from the Spirit&#x27;, and questions whether the worship band, now so often amplified and playing like a rock band, replace rather than enable a congregation&#x27;s praise.

Seventh-day Adventist author Samuele Bacchiocchi expressed concerns over the use of the &quot;rock&quot; idiom, as he argues that music communicates on a subconscious level, and the often anarchistic, nihilistic ethos of rock stands against Christian culture. Using the physical response induced by drums in a worship context as evidence that rock takes peoples&#x27; minds away from contemplating on the lyrics and God, he suggests that rock is actively dangerous for the Church.

The theological content too has raised questions for some, including Martyn Percy, who argues there is too great an emphasis on a very intimate relationship with God, using terms such as &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27; instead of &#x27;we&#x27; and &#x27;God&#x27;, and very passionate, physical language, and argues that this bias needs urgent correction. He explains how the emphasis on emotion can encourage hype and a need to create an atmosphere which evokes a sense of encounter with God, rather than allowing God to do so.

Despite the biblical basis employed to underpin CWM, such as , its surrounding culture tends to exclude systematic use of the psalms in weekly worship, sidelining lament from regular worship practice. The emphasis on praise, and on an interpretation of &#x27;worship&#x27; that is overwhelmingly positive, can lead to avoidance of the psalms of lament. Michael Vasey writes: &quot;Scripture is, of course, full of lament – and devotes its finest literary creation to warning the godly against quick and easy answers. The power of many of the psalms we are embarrassed to use lies precisely here. Of all this there is little echo in our contemporary reading.&quot; Whereas denominational churches generally use a weekly lectionary that gives a broad range of scriptural themes, including selected psalms on those themes, CWM churches tend not to have an agreed lectionary and the consequent agreement on using a broad range of material.

Pope John Paul II, concerning the role of music in regard to worship, wrote, &quot;today, as yesterday, musicians, composers, liturgical chapel cantors, church organists and instrumentalists must feel the necessity of serious and rigorous professional training. They should be especially conscious of the fact that each of their creations or interpretations cannot escape the requirement of being a work that is inspired, appropriate and attentive to aesthetic dignity, transformed into a prayer of worship when, in the course of the liturgy, it expresses the mystery of faith in sound.&quot;

Some have noted that contemporary worship songs often reflect the social climate of individualism as the lyrics emphasize personal relationship with God, even within a group context.

Interviewed in &quot;Christianity Today&quot; in 2011, Grove City College professor T. David Gordon said contemporary music was not easier to sing or better than traditional music, but familiar. If this style of music was all people listened to, then that would make them happy. He also said praise bands had a hard time finding good music, but played the contemporary music because the church wanted it, with the only criteria being how contemporary the music sounded. Gordon also said churches were adding hymns to contemporary services, but that in the past the main concern had never been how new the music sounded.

Gordon said in 2014 that contemporary music could not be as good because one generation could not compete with 50 generations of hymns, and even the contemporary songs were in some cases just the old hymns with an updated sound. Writers of new songs had a hard time with &quot;theologically sound, but significant, profound, appropriate, memorable, and edifying&quot;. After his 2011 interview, Gordon said Mark Moring of &quot;Christianity Today&quot; had observed that contemporary music in churches was on the decline. Gordon said the people who first wanted it are older, and contemporary music had become so common that it was no longer a marketing tool, and no longer new when people wanted what was new. Praise teams, Gordon said, were like performers, but that they were in conflict with what the Bible said. And the congregation needed to participate.

==Popularity==

Some songs now appear in more traditional hymnals. &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; (published in 2006 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) includes &quot;Lord, I Lift Your Name on High&quot; by Rick Founds and &quot;Shout to the Lord&quot; by Darlene Zschech. The &quot;United Methodist Hymnal&quot; (1989) includes &quot;Thy Word Is a Lamp&quot; by Amy Grant and &quot;Take Our Bread&quot; by Joe Wise.

Contemporary Christian worship groups, such as Hillsong United, are ranking in the top ten on &quot;Billboard&quot; and other national charts and are earning publicity in pop culture publications.

In 2019, the U.S. radio network Air1 (which was previously devoted to Christian hits) changed its format to focus primarily on worship music.

<text>was a Japanese daimyo, swordsman, and martial arts writer, founder of the Edo branch of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, which he learned from his father Yagyū &quot;Sekishūsai&quot; Muneyoshi. This was one of two official sword styles patronized by the Tokugawa shogunate (the other one being &quot;Ittō-ryū&quot;). Munenori began his career in the Tokugawa administration as a hatamoto, a direct retainer of the Tokugawa house, and later had his income raised to 10,000 &quot;koku&quot;, making him a minor &quot;fudai daimyō&quot; (vassal lord serving the Tokugawa), with landholdings around his ancestral village of Yagyū-zato. He also received the title of ().

==Career==
Munenori entered the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu at a young age, and later was an instructor of swordsmanship to Ieyasu&#x27;s son Hidetada. Still later, he became one of the primary advisors of the third shōgun Iemitsu.

Shortly before his death in 1606, Sekishusai passed the leadership of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū to his grandson Toshiyoshi. Following a period of musha shugyō, Toshiyoshi entered the service of a cadet branch of the Tokugawa clan that controlled the Owari province. Toshiyoshi&#x27;s school was based in Nagoya and came to be called (), while Munenori&#x27;s, in Edo, the Tokugawa capital, came to be known as (). Takenaga Hayato, the founder of the &quot;Yagyū Shingan-ryū&quot;, was a disciple of Yagyū Munenori and received &quot;gokui&quot; (secret teachings) of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū from him.

In about 1632, Munenori completed the Heihō kadensho, a treatise on practical Shinkage-ryū swordsmanship and how it could be applied on a macro level to life and politics. The text remains in print in Japan today, and has been translated a number of times into English.

Munenori&#x27;s sons, Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi and Yagyū Munefuyu, were also famous swordsmen.

The essay &quot;The Mysterious Record of Immovable Wisdom&quot; by Takuan Sōhō was a letter written from Sōhō to Munenori.

<doc id="317124" wikidata="Q13635778" url="?curid=317124" title="Hemispherical combustion chamber">
<text>A hemispherical combustion chamber is a combustion chamber in the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine with a domed &quot;hemispheric&quot; shape. An engine featuring this type of hemispherical chamber is known as a hemi engine. In practice, shapes less than a full hemisphere are typically employed, as are variations (or faceting in parts) of a true hemispheric profile. The primary advantage of such shapes are increased compression (leading to greater power) and very large intake and exhaust valves (allowing better flow of intake and exhaust gasses, also resulting in improved volumetric efficiency and greater power); the primary disadvantages are complex valve trains (caused by valves being placed opposite one-another in a head) and expense (of machining the heads and pistons, and additional valve train components).

While hemispherical combustion chambers are still found in the 2000s multi-valve arrangements (of four and even five valves per cylinder) and the popularity of overhead cam (including double overhead cam) arrangements have altered the traditional trade-offs in employing &quot;hemi heads&quot;.

==History==

Hemispherical combustion chambers were introduced on some of the earliest automotive engines, shortly after the viability of the internal combustion engine was first demonstrated. Their name reflects the domed recess in a cylinder head and correspondingly shaped top of a piston enclosing a space that approximates a half of a sphere (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;), although in practice the actual enclosed space is generally less than half.

Hemispherical cylinder heads have been used since at least 1901; they were used by the Belgian car maker Pipe in 1905 and by the 1907 Fiat 130 HP Grand Prix racer. The Peugeot Grand Prix car of 1912 and the Alfa Romeo Grand Prix car of 1914 were both four-valve engines, and Daimler and Riley were also using hemispherical combustion chambers at the time. Beginning in 1912, Stutz used four-valve engines, conceptually anticipating modern car engines. Other examples include the BMW double-pushrod design (adopted by Bristol Cars), the Peugeot 403, the Toyota T engine and Toyota V engine (Toyota&#x27;s first V8 engine), Miller racing engines, and the Jaguar XK engine.

==Technology and implementation==
A hemispherical head (&quot;hemi-head&quot;) gives an efficient combustion chamber with minimal heat loss to the head, and allows for two large valves. However, a hemi-head usually allows no more than two valves per cylinder due to the difficulty in arranging the valve gear for four valves at diverging angles, and these large valves are necessarily heavier than those in a multi-valve engine of similar valve area, as well as generally requiring more valve lift. The intake and exhaust valves lie on opposite sides of the chamber and necessitate a &quot;cross-flow&quot; head design. Since the combustion chamber is virtually a hemisphere, a flat-topped piston yields a lower compression ratio unless a smaller chamber is utilized.

Significant challenges in the commercialization of engines utilizing hemispherical chambers revolved around the design of the valve actuation, and how to make it effective, efficient, and reliable at an acceptable cost, which normally requires the use of either a dual rocker system, or dual camshafts to operate the inlet and exhaust valves. Complexity was referenced early in Chrysler&#x27;s development of their 1950s hemi engine: the head was referred to in company advertising as the &quot;Double Rocker&quot; head. Ford&#x27;s CVH (Compound Valve Hemispherical) engine of the 1980s solved the problem by way of utilizing a complex geometry of the valve angle combined with a cam-in-head configuration that allowed hemispherical arranged valves to be operated by a single camshaft and without the need for two rocker shafts.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Although a wedge-head design offers simplified valve actuation, it usually does so by placing the valves side by side within the chamber, with parallel stem axes. This can restrict the flow of the intake and exhaust into and out of the chamber by limiting the diameters of valve heads to total no more than the bore of the cylinder in a two valve per cylinder arrangement. With a hemispherical chamber with splayed valve stem angle, this limitation is increased by the angle, making the total valve diameter size possible to exceed the bore size within an overhead valve configuration. See IOE engine for another method.

Also, the splayed valve angle causes the valve seat plane to be tilted, giving a straighter flow path for the intake and exhaust to/from the port exiting the cylinder head. Engineers have learned that while increasing the valve size with straighter port is beneficial for increasing the maximum power at high rpm, it slows the intake flow speed, not providing the best combustion event for emissions, efficiency, or power in the normal rpm range.

Domed pistons are commonly used to maintain a higher mechanical compression ratio, which tend to increase the flame propagation distance, being also detrimental to efficient combustion, unless the number of spark plugs per cylinder is increased.

Flame temperatures are very high, leading to excessive NOx output which may require exhaust gas recirculation and other emission control measures to meet modern standards. Other drawbacks of the hemispherical chamber include increased production cost and high relative weight (25% heavier than a comparable wedge head according to Chrysler&#x27;s engineers). These had pushed the hemi head out of favor in the modern era, until Chrysler&#x27;s 2003 redesign that has proven popular.


==Use==

===Alfa Romeo===
Alfa Romeo has produced successful hemi-head engines throughout the years. Arguably one of their most beloved examples is Giuseppe Busso&#x27;s original 2.5-liter V6, which has been cited by some as one of the best and most distinctive sounding production engines (even in its later 24v forms) of all time. Part of this praise is likely because the hemispherical heads on the original 2-valve engine allowed for an almost completely straight exhaust port, resulting in a less diluted or muddied engine sound, allowing Alfa Romeo to use quieter stock exhausts without losing much of their distinct and beloved race-bred engine noise.

===Aston Martin===
Aston Martin&#x27;s DOHC V8 used a hemispherical chamber during the late 1960s through to the late 1980s. Each of four cams controlled one set of valves per cylinder bank. The Aston Martin V8 5.3 L (5340 cc/325 in3) produced gross.

===BMW===
BMW became a worldwide marque on the strength of its responsive yet durable SOHC hemi-head inline-4 M10 engine, most famously made in a displacement in its 2002 sports sedan of the 1960s and 1970s.

===Chrysler===

Perhaps the most widely known proponent of the hemispherical chamber design is the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler became identified primarily by trademarking the &quot;Hemi&quot; name and then using it extensively in their advertising campaigns beginning in the 1960s. Chrysler has produced three generations of such engines: the Chrysler FirePower engine in the 1950s; the 426 Hemi), developed for NASCAR in 1964 and produced through the early 1970s; and the &quot;new HEMI&quot; from 2003 to 2024. The most recent rendition of the Chrysler &quot;Hemi&quot; engine uses part of an oblate spheroid (flattened sphere) for its head shape to improve combustion efficiency over a true hemispherical head.

===Ford===
In 1964 Ford produced a single overhead cam 425 cu in FE-based hemi V8 known as the &quot;427 SOHC &quot;Cammer&quot;&quot;. Designed in 90 days of intensive engineering effort for use in racing, it never appeared in a production Ford vehicle, instead being sold as an optional engine at Ford parts counters. Period dynamometer results claim the SOHC Hemi produced almost 700 hp (522 kW) in crate form (100 hp per liter). It used the side oiler engine block modified to replace an in-block cam with an idler shaft driving the distributor and oil pump, and accommodate other overhead camshaft issues. The overhead cams meant that it was not as rpm-limited as the Chrysler Hemis were with their pushrods and heavy and complex valvetrains.

Later Ford engine designs with hemispherical chambers included the &quot;Calliope&quot;, which used two in-block cams, arranged one over the other, to drive 3 valves per hemispherical chamber. The pushrods activating the valves from the top camshaft were almost horizontal. In 1968, Ford brought out the completely new &quot;385-series&quot; engine family, which used a modified form of the hemispherical chamber.

In the 1970s, Ford designed and produced a small-block &quot;Windsor&quot; engine with hemispherical heads to address the growing concerns about fuel economy. Unfortunately, even with an ahead-of-its-time direct fuel injection system feeding a stratified charge chamber, the hemi&#x27;s emissions could not be made clean enough for compliance with regulations. This plus the cost of the valve actuation systems, along with the cost of the high pressure pump needed to deliver fuel directly into the chamber, as well as the gilmer belt drive system needed to drive the pump, made further development pointless at the time. 

Most 1980s 4-cylinder Fords used the Ford CVH engine, &quot;CVH&quot; meaning Compound Valve, Hemispherical (combustion chamber). Post 1986 the cylinder head of this engine was reworked to heart-shaped lean-burn combustion chambers, and used in low-performance models not benefiting from multipoint fuel injection - 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 in Europe, though was still referred to colloquially as the CVH.

===Jaguar===
The hemi-head Jaguar XK engine, introduced in 1949, powered cars ranging from the Le Mans winning D-Type to the XJ6.
===Lamborghini===
The Lamborghini V12, designed in 1963 and produced for more than 50 years, used hemispherical chambers.


===Lancia===
The Lancia V4 and Lancia V6 engines both used hemispherical combustion chambers.

===Lotus===
Lotus has used hemispherical chambers, as in the Lotus-Ford Twin Cam. 
===Mercedes Benz===
Hemispherical chambers were a feature of the M102 engine introduced in 1980, which together with the crossflow head design promoted greater efficiency over the M115 engine it replaced.

===MG===
The MGA Twin-Cam was a variant of the pushrod MGA 1600 MkI MG MGA line from 1958 to 1960. The original pushrod 1588 cc cast iron block was fitted with a cast aluminum twin-cam two-valve cylinder head. Early versions proved fragile on the street and in competition due to pre-ignition (detonation), and oil loss, which led to decreasing the compression ratio from 9.1. to 8.3 with redesigned pistons. It was a successful update but sales dropped off so rapidly the company halted Twin Cam production and used the matching chassis for some MGAs, with pushrod engines, known as the MGA 1600 MkI and MkII DeLuxe models.

===Mitsubishi===
Mitsubishi produced several hemi engines including the &#x27;Orion&#x27;, &#x27;Astron&#x27;, and &#x27;Saturn&#x27; units.

===Nissan===
Nissan&#x27;s Z, VG (SOHC version only) and DOHC VQ engines use hemispherical combustion chambers. The Z and VG are true hemispherical while the VQ uses a compound pent-roof shape.

===Porsche===
Porsche has made extensive use of hemi-head engines, including the air-cooled flat-6 engine in Porsche 911 models from 1963 to 1999. The 1973 2.7 L version generated 56 hp per naturally aspirated litre of piston displacement.

===Toyota===
Toyota&#x27;s V engine family were longitudinally mounted V8s used in the prestigious Toyota Century from the 1960s through the 1990s. Toyota had worked with Yamaha to produce the first Japanese full aluminum alloy block engine. The V Family is often referred to as the Toyota HEMI as the engine features a similar cylinder head design to those found on the Chrysler&#x27;s Hemi, even though most of the engine design is completely different.

Other Toyota engines (e.g. T, 2M, 4M etc.) at the time used a hemispherical combustion chamber. The spark plugs were located at the top of the combustion chamber.

==Design evolution in modern engines==
In the modern emissions-era, the hemi-chamber has morphed into more sophisticated and complex designs that are able to extract more power with lower emissions from any given combustion event.

Many of today&#x27;s engines use &quot;active combustion chambers&quot; designed to tumble and swirl the fuel/air mix within the chamber for the most efficient combustion event possible. These chambers usually look like kidney beans or two merged small &#x27;hemi&#x27; areas surrounded by flat quenching areas over the pistons.

<text>Bo &quot;Bosse&quot; Ingvar Karchimirer Ringholm (born 18 August 1942) is a Swedish Social Democratic politician. He held the titles of Minister of Finance, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Policy Coordination, and Minister for Sport in the Persson administration.

== Career ==
Ringholm was born in Falköping, a town in the west of Sweden, and grew up in a working-class family. He lacks higher education, and dropped out of high school after failing both Maths and English. Like many Swedish Social Democratic politicians of his generation, Ringholm started his political career in the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League, an organisation he led 1967–1972. As chairman of the Social Democratic Youth League, Ringholm was known for his radical left-wing views. Among other things, he advocated the nationalization of private-owned Swedish bank institutions and Swedish economic support to the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (FNL), the government of North Vietnam, the Pathet Lao in Laos and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

After stepping down from chairman of SSU, Ringholm worked as a political adviser at the Ministries of the Interior and Labour. He also became active in the local politics of Stockholm. From 1973 he was a member of the Stockholm County Council, and two years later he was elected to the executive committee of the Stockholm party branch. In 1976 he became a director at the Ministry of Education and Science, and worked in the government administration until he became Transportation Commissioner of the Stockholm County from 1983. From 1997 he was the director-general of the Swedish Labour Market Board (AMS), until Prime Minister Göran Persson unexpectedly named him to succeed Erik Åsbrink as Minister for Finance in 1999.

On 21 October 2004 Göran Persson announced a restructuring of his government, in which Ringholm was moved from the Ministry of Finance to become Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Policy Coordination and Minister for Sport. The reason cited by Persson was Ringholm was not interested in continuing as Minister of Finance following the coming 2006 general elections. His successor was Pär Nuder.

Following the resignation of Laila Freivalds on 21 March 2006, Ringholm was temporarily acting as Minister for Foreign Affairs until 27 March, when he was replaced by Carin Jämtin who also held the post temporarily until the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jan Eliasson, took office on 24 April.

== Private ==
Although Ringholm&#x27;s given name is Bo, he is almost always referred to as &quot;Bosse&quot;, the common Swedish nickname for Bo - even in formal circumstances. He is a teetotaller. He is also known for his great interest in sports and was the chair of Enskede sports club for 15 years until he declared he was going to step down when he became Minister for Sport. His involvement in the club has been far from unproblematic. In the summer of 2004, it was discovered that the club had neglected to pay taxes related to the sale of ad space. Ringholm denied any knowledge of this but promised that the taxes were going to be paid. A few months later the Swedish national public radio aired a news story claiming that Enskede sports club had made payments to trainers without reporting them to tax authorities, prompting the Swedish National Tax Board to investigate the matter. Ringholm, however, denied the allegations.

<doc id="317127" wikidata="Q971687" url="?curid=317127" title="Kunio Yanagita">
<text>was a Japanese author, scholar, and folklorist. He began his career as a bureaucrat, but developed an interest in rural Japan and its folk traditions. This led to a change in his career. His pursuit of this led to his eventual establishment of Japanese native folkloristics, or &quot;minzokugaku&quot;, as an academic field in Japan. As a result, he is often considered to be the father of modern Japanese folklore studies.

==Early life==
Yanagita was born as the fifth child of the Matsuoka family in the town of Fukusaki, located in Hyōgo Prefecture. He was born with the name Kunio Matsuoka (or Matsuoka Kunio in the Japanese manner of naming), but was adopted into the family of a court justice named Naohei Yanagita. At the time, it was fairly common practice for families without a son to adopt a young boy or man into the family to inherit the family&#x27;s property. This would often occur through marriage, with the adopting family marrying a daughter of the family off to their chosen heir as a way of binding him to the family. In this particular case, a match was made between the future folklorist and Naohei&#x27;s daughter, Taka. The two were wed in 1901, and his name was changed to Kunio Yanagita.

Yanagita was known from a fairly young age for his interest in literature, particularly that of poetry. He also was a fan of Western literature. As he began to take an interest in folklore, Yanagita began reading ethnologies by Western anthropologists, such as Edward Burnett Tylor, shaping his later work.

==Career==
After graduating with a degree in law from Tokyo Imperial University, Yanagita began a career as a civil servant, working for the Department of Agricultural Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, that would last for about 20 years. While still a civic official, Yanagita was active in literature movements, having been so impacted by reading the works of Henrik Ibsen that he formed the Ipusen-kai, an Ibsen Society to study the plays of Ibsen in Japan. Over the course of his time in bureaucracy, duties, Yanagita traveled around the countrysides of Honshū, the mainland of Japan. During these business trips, Yanagita became increasingly focused on the affairs of rural villages and their agricultural economic policy.

As time passed, Yanagita began growing increasingly critical of the lack of concern for local autonomy allowed by the policies favored by his fellow civil servants. He gradually began to advocate in support of these groups, pushing for a shift in agricultural focus to center around cooperatives of small farmers rather than wealthy landlords. It is believed that the pushback he received against his values and ideas may have contributed to his change in careers and shift toward folklore studies.

Yanagita&#x27;s departure from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce allowed him the opportunity to further investigate rural Japan. He began in-depth analysis, traveling around to record stories of local customs, practices, and beliefs. It was at this point that his literary friends, including writer Shimazaki Toson, began encouraging him to publish works based on oral traditions and customs of rural villages. His most famous example of this is a book known as &quot;The Legends of Tōno&quot; (1912). It is a compilation of short stories, practices, beliefs, and anecdotes from Tōno, a small, rural community surrounded by mountains in Iwate.

From here, Yanagita&#x27;s work developed into the anthropological study of folklore that he is still known for today. He published many other works, including several with folklorist Kizen Sasaki, with whom he collaborated extensively.

Yanagita&#x27;s focus on local traditions was part of a larger effort to insert the lives of commoners into narratives of Japanese history. He argued that historical narratives were typically dominated by events pertaining to rulers and high-ranking officials. Yanagita claimed that these narratives focused on elite-centered historical events and ignored the relative uneventfulness and repetition that characterized the lives of ordinary Japanese people across history. He emphasized the unique practices of different groups of common people, such as &quot;sanka&quot; or mountain dwellers, and island dwellers. He also focused primarily on what he saw as the three areas of folklore studies: material objects, oral transmission, and mental or emotional phenomenon. This third category, accessible only to those who share a deep understanding through similar experiences, is considered the main focus of folklore studies.

As a whole, Yanagita&#x27;s work is highly memorable and genre-defining. He is one of the premiere folklorists of Japan, and he helped to create the field of &quot;minzokugaku&quot; itself, earning him the title of &quot;father of modern Japanese folklore.&quot;

== Major works ==

* &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot; (遠野物語) – Yanagita&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Tōno Monogatari&quot;, is a record of folk legends, stories, and traditions (as opposed to a folk tale) gathered in Tōno, a city in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. Famous yōkai in the stories include kappa and zashiki-warashi.
* &quot;Kagyūkō&quot; (蝸牛考) – Yanagita revealed that the distribution of dialects for the word &quot;snail&quot; forms concentric circles on the Japanese archipelago (Center versus periphery theory of dialectical diffusion over time).
* &quot;Momotarō no Tanjō&quot; (桃太郎の誕生) – In this work, Yanagita provides analysis into themes of Japanese folklore and society. The name of the work is derived from the famous Japanese tale of Momotarō, as one of the examples he uses in his commentary on folktales as a form of reference material for understanding Japanese culture. In this work, he analyzes Momotarō to discuss some facets of Japanese society as a whole. His methodology in this has since been followed by many ethnologists and anthropologists.
* &quot;Kaijō no Michi&quot; (海上の道) – This piece, published only a year before Yanagita&#x27;s death, records the history, culture, and folk tradition of the Okinawa islands of Japan. In his studies of Okinawa, Yanagita sought the origins of Japanese culture in the area, though many of his speculations were denied by later researchers. It is also said that his inspiration for this research came from picking up a palm nut borne by the Kuroshio Current when he was wandering on a beach in the cape of Irago Misaki, Aichi Prefecture.
* &quot;Kunio Guide to the Japanese Folk Tale&quot; – This is a selection of Japanese folktales and data from Yanagita Kunio&#x27;s &quot;Nihon mukashi-banashi meii&quot; (日本昔話名彙), translated by Fanny Hagin Meyer. 
* &quot;Nochi no Kari-kotoba no Ki&quot; (後狩詞記) – He privately published a work based on his travels around Kyūshū, focusing on the traditions and ways of life of a mountain community from Miyazaki Prefecture, including details about their hunting practices and the vocabulary used to discuss it. This work is considered one of the first works of Japanese folklore studies from Japan.

<text>Habsburg (High Alemannic: &quot;Hapschberg&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Brugg in canton of Aargau in Switzerland. It lies about three kilometres southwest of the town of Brugg, the capital of the district of Brugg. Habsburg is named after Habsburg Castle, built around 1020–1030 for Count Radbot of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, which Habsburg was also a part of at the time.
==History==

While Bronze Age and Roman era artifacts have been discovered, a village named Habsburg isn&#x27;t mentioned until 1027, as &quot;Habesbur&quot; or &quot;Habeburch&quot;. This reference comes from a later (1114) copy of the original 1027 document. In 1114 it was mentioned &quot;Hauesborc&quot;.

The documentation of the village in 1027 is contemporary with Count Radbot&#x27;s construction of Habsburg Castle. It is believed that they named the castle after a hawk () seen sitting on its walls. Some historians and linguists believe the name may come from the Middle High German word &#x27;hab / hap&#x27; meaning ford, as it is located near a ford of the Aar River. Habsburg Castle became the originating family seat of the House of Habsburg, which went on to become one of the leading royal dynasties in Europe.

Habsburg Castle remained the property of the House of Habsburg until 1415, when Duke Frederick IV of the Empty Pockets lost the canton of Aargau to the Swiss Confederacy.

The area around the Habsburg Castle and the modern municipality, was covered by forests that were only cleared around 1500, nearly half a millennium after Habsburg Castle was first constructed.

Religiously, it was always part of the parish of Windisch. The community grew slowly. In 1529 there were only four houses in the village, and the school was first built in 1747. The economy was almost exclusively agriculture (including a little viticulture) until 1800 when a small plaster industry came to the village. In 1818, the schoolhouse was built, while in 1896 a fire house and pond were added. The municipal water supply was built in 1908 and in 1916 the village was connected to the electric grid. By 1960 the population decreased due to lack of earning potential and from the remote location. But it grew again after 1971 when several new houses were built. Since 1984, there has been a Postauto bus to Habsburg.

==Geography==

<doc id="317131" wikidata="Q559747" url="?curid=317131" title="Yoshida Shōin">
<text>, commonly named , was one of Japan&#x27;s most distinguished intellectuals in the late years of the Tokugawa shogunate. He devoted himself to nurturing many &quot;ishin shishi&quot; who in turn made major contributions to the Meiji Restoration.

==Early life==
Born Sugi Toranosuke in Hagi in the Chōshū region of Japan, he was the second son of Sugi Yurinosuke (1804–1865), a modest rank Samurai and his wife Kodama Taki (1807–1890). Yurinosuke had two younger brothers, Yoshida Daisuke and Tamaki Bunnoshin. Sugi Toranosuke&#x27;s eldest brother was Sugi Umetarō (1828–1910), his four younger sisters were Sugi Yoshiko (later Kodama Yoshiko) (1832–1924), Sugi Hisa (later Odamura Hisa) (1839–1881), Sugi Tsuya (1841–1843), and Sugi Fumi (later Katori Miwako) (1843–1921), his youngest brother was Sugi Toshisaburō (1845–1876).

Sugi Toranosuke was later adopted at the age of four by Yoshida Daisuke and was renamed to Yoshida Shōin. The process of adopting younger sons from the Sugi house was established generations before Shoin&#x27;s birth. To avoid financial insolvency, the Sugi house controlled two additional samurai lineages-the Tamaki and the Yoshida lineages. The oldest male became the Sugi heir and the younger Sugi sons were adopted by the Tamaki and Yoshida lines as their heirs-to ensure the Sugi succession was protected, this required the head of the house in the Yoshida line and most generations the Tamaki line to remain unmarried. Daisuke, already in ill health, died one year later at the age of 28, leaving Yoshida Shoin as the heir of the Yoshida lineage at five years of age. His house was also the instructor to the &quot;daimyō&quot; in military studies.

Due to Shōin&#x27;s young age, four men were appointed to represent the Yoshida house as instructors. Shōin&#x27;s younger uncle, Tamaki, set about accelerating Shōin&#x27;s education to prepare the boy for his eventual duties to be trained as a Yamaga instructor. In 1839 at the age of 9, he was taught by a military art instructor at Meirinkan. At the age of 11, his talent was recognized for his excellent performance for his lecture to the &quot;daimyō&quot; Mōri Takachika. At the age of 13, he led the Chōshū forces to conducted a Western fleet extermination exercise.

In 1845, he received a lecture on the Naganuma Military Arts by Yusuke Yamada. In 1851, he went to Edo and studied the Western military science under Sakuma Shōzan and Asaka Gonsai. In 1851, he studied under Miyabe Teizō and Yamaga Sosui from the Higo Domain. This period of intense study suggests a formative experience that shaped Shōin into an educator and activist that helped spur the Meiji Restoration. 

==Rewards of Punishment==
At the end of 1851, Yoshida left for a four-month trip across Northeastern Japan. He had been granted verbal permission from the Chōshū government but left before receiving his written permission in an act of defiance. This act of defiance was a serious offense known as dappan or &quot;fleeing the han&quot;. He returned to Hagi in 1852. His punishment from the &quot;daimyō&quot; was costly but sweet for Shōin. He was stripped of his samurai status and his stipend of 57 &quot;koku&quot; with it. His father, Sugi Yurinosuke, was appointed as his guardian. Shōin was then granted 10 years of leisure in which he could study in any part of Japan that he chose.

On January16, 1853, Yoshida Shōin was granted permission to return to Edo to continue his studies. His timing for his return to Edo turned out to coincide with Matthew Perry’s arrival in Japan.

==Attempt to escape and imprisonment==
Matthew Perry visited Japan in 1853 and 1854. Several months after Perry&#x27;s arrival at Uraga, Sakuma Shōzan petitioned the Bakufu to allow promising candidates to go to the United States to study the ways of the West. The petition was denied but Sakuma and Shoin resolved that Shoin would stow away onboard Perry&#x27;s ship to visit the west for study. Shortly before Perry left, Yoshida and a friend went to Shimoda where Perry&#x27;s Black Ships were anchored, and tried to gain admittance. They first presented a letter asking to be let aboard one of his ships.

Then, in the dead of night Yoshida tried to secretly climb aboard the ship . Perry&#x27;s troops noticed them, and they were refused. Shortly thereafter, they were caged by Tokugawa bakufu troops. Even in a cage, they managed to smuggle a written message to Perry. Yoshida Shōin was sent to a jail in Edo, then to one in Hagi where he was sentenced to house arrest.

Yoshida had never introduced himself to Perry, who never learned his name.

While in jail, he ran a school. After his release, he took over his uncle&#x27;s tiny private school, Shōka Sonjuku to teach the youth military arts and politics. Since he was forbidden from travelling, he had his students travel Japan as investigators.

By 1858, Ii Naosuke, the bakufu Tairō who signed treaties with the Western powers, began to round up sonnō jōi rebels in Kyōto, Edo, and eventually the provinces. Many of Yoshida Shoin&#x27;s followers were caught up in the dragnet. That year, Yoshida Shōin put down the brush and took up the sword. When Ii Naosuke sent a servant to (unsuccessfully) ask the emperor to support one of his treaties with the foreigners, Yoshida Shōin led a revolt, calling on &quot;rōnin&quot; to aid him, but received very little support. Nonetheless, he and a small band of students attacked and attempted to kill Ii&#x27;s servant in Kyoto. The revolt failed, and Yoshida Shoin was again imprisoned in Chōshū.

==Death==
In 1859, Chōshū was ordered to send its most dangerous insurgents to Edo&#x27;s prisons. Once there, Yoshida Shōin confessed the assassination plot, and, from jail, continued to plot the rebellion. He did not expect to be executed until the Tokugawa executed three of his friends. In October 15, he asked for a piece of tissue paper to clear his nasal passage, then recited his final death poem: &#x27;Parental love exceeds one&#x27;s love for his parents. How will they take the tidings of today?&#x27;. Two days later in October 17, he was informed of his death sentence. When it was Yoshida&#x27;s turn in November 21, he was brought to an open courtyard adjacent to the prison, and led to the scaffold. With perfect composure he kneeled atop a straw mat, beyond which was a rectangular hole dug in the rich, dark earth to absorb the blood. Upon his death by decapitation, his executioner Yamada Asaemon said that he died a noble death. He was 29 years old.

After his execution, he was first buried by Itō Hirobumi and his Chōshū comrades near the execution site. In 1863, he was later reburied by his supporters at Wakabayashi, Edo.

==Posthumous influence==
At least five of his students, Takasugi Shinsaku, Katsura Kogorō, Inoue Kaoru, Itō Hirobumi and Yamagata Aritomo later became widely known, and virtually all of the survivors of the Sonjuku group became officers in the Meiji Restoration. Takasugi led rifle companies against the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s army when it failed to conquer Chōshū in 1864, rapidly leading to the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate. Itō Hirobumi became Japan&#x27;s first prime minister.

==Legacy==
In 1882, Yoshida Shōin was enshrined at Shōin shrine in Wakabayashi, Setagaya-ku (35-1), in Tokyo, and the current shrine&#x27;s main building was built in 1927, as well as in his birthplace Hagi, Yamaguchi Prefecture (山口県萩市椿東1537).

In 1888 Yoshida was enshrined into the Yasukuni Shrine and was posthumously awarded Senior Fourth Rank by 1889.

Shoin University was named after him. There are two other universities whose names include Shoin in Japan, but they are unrelated to him.

&quot;Hana Moyu&quot; is a 2015 Japanese television drama NHK Taiga drama series that premiered on January 4, 2015, and ended on December 13, 2015. The series starred Mao Inoue who portrayed Sugi Fumi, a younger sister of Yoshida Shōin. The role of Yoshida Shōin was played by actor Yūsuke Iseya.

<text>Noli Me Tángere (Latin for &quot;Touch Me Not&quot;) is a novel by Filipino writer and activist José Rizal and was published during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. It explores inequities in law and practice in terms of the treatment by the ruling government and the Spanish Catholic friars of the resident peoples in the late 19th century.

Originally written by Rizal in Spanish, the book has since been more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Tagalog (the major indigenous language), or English. The Rizal Law requires &quot;Noli&quot;, published in 1887, and its 1891 sequel, &quot;El filibusterismo&quot;, to be read by all high school students throughout the country. &quot;Noli&quot; is studied in Grade 9 and in Grade 10. The two novels are widely considered to be the national epic of the Philippines. They have been adapted in many forms, such as operas, musicals, plays, and other forms of art.

The title originates from the Biblical passage John 20:13-17. In Rizal&#x27;s time, it also referred to cancers that occurred on the face, particularly cancers of the eyelid; touching such lesions irritated them, causing pain. As an ophthalmologist, Rizal was familiar with the cancer and the name. He is explicit about the connection in the novel&#x27;s dedication, which begins: (&#x27;To my country&#x27;) and continues with &quot;...a cancer of so malignant a character that the least touch irritates it and awakens in it the sharpest pains.&quot; Rizal probes the cancers of Filipino society. Early English translations of the novel used different titles, such as An Eagle Flight (1900) and The Social Cancer (1912), but more recent English translations use the original title.
==Background==
José Rizal, a Filipino nationalist and polymath, conceived the idea of writing a novel that would expose the backwardness and lack of progress of Philippine society because of the burden of colonization. According to historian Carlos Quirino, the novel bears similarities in terms of characterization and plot to the Spanish novelist Benito Pérez Galdós&#x27; &quot;Doña Perfecta&quot;. Rizal intended to express the way Filipino culture was perceived to be backward, anti-progress, anti-intellectual, and not conducive to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment. At the time, he was a student of medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid.

Other Filipinos were also working or studying in Madrid which, as the capital of Spain, was the center of culture and universities. At a gathering on January 2, 1884, of friends at the house of Pedro A. Paterno, Rizal proposed that a group of Filipinos should collaborate on a novel about the Philippines. His proposal was unanimously approved by those present, among whom were Pedro, Máximo Viola and Antonio Paterno, Graciano López Jaena, Evaristo Aguirre, Eduardo de Lete, Julio Llorente, and Valentin Ventura. However, they never got into the project. Although agreeing to help, none of the others wrote anything. Initially, Rizal planned for the novel to encompass all phases of Filipino life, but most of his friends, all young males, wanted to write about women. Rizal saw that his companions spent more time gambling and flirting with Spanish women than writing. Because of this, he decided to draft the novel alone.

==Plot==
Crisóstomo Ibarra, the &quot;mestizo&quot; son of the recently deceased Don Rafael Ibarra, is returning to San Diego town in Laguna after seven years of study in Europe. Kapitán Tiago, a family friend, invites him to a reunion party in Manila. At the party, Crisóstomo meets Padre Dámaso who was San Diego&#x27;s parish priest when Crisóstomo left for Europe. Dámaso treats Crisóstomo with hostility, to the surprise of the young man who regarded the priest as his father&#x27;s friend. Later, as Crisóstomo was walking back to his hotel, Lieutenant Guevara, another friend of his father, informs him that Don Rafael may have been killed for political reasons and Dámaso may have been involved. Guevara warns him to be careful.

The following day, Crisóstomo returns to Tiago&#x27;s home to meet with his childhood sweetheart, Tiago&#x27;s daughter María Clara. As the two flirt and reminisce, María reads back to him a part of his farewell letter on his discussion with his father about the state of the country. Ibarra excuses himself eventually as it was time to go to San Diego.

Arriving in San Diego, Crisóstomo goes to the cemetery and finds his father&#x27;s grave desecrated. He seeks out the gravedigger who then tells him that the parish priest had ordered Don Rafael&#x27;s remains transferred to the Chinese cemetery, but that he threw the corpse into the lake instead out of fear and pity. At that moment, the town&#x27;s new parish priest, Padre Bernardo Salví, passes by wherein an enraged Crisóstomo pushes him to the ground, demanding an explanation; a fearful Salví states that he was only newly assigned to the town but reveals that Padre Dámaso ordered the transfer.

Crisóstomo decides to forgive and commits to improvements in his town. He plans to build a private school, believing that his s would benefit from a more modern education than what is offered in the government schools, which were under the influence of the friars. Enjoying widespread support from the locals and Spanish authorities, Crisóstomo&#x27;s project advances quickly. He receives counsel from Don Anastacio, a local philosopher, and recruits a progressive schoolmaster. Construction was set to begin shortly with the cornerstone to be laid in a few weeks during San Diego&#x27;s town fiesta.

One day, Crisóstomo, María and their friends go on a picnic along the shores of the Laguna de Baý. They discover that a crocodile had been lurking in the Ibarras&#x27; fish pens. The boatman jumps into the water with a knife drawn. Crisóstomo follows him and the two subdue the animal together. Elías, the boatman, proclaims himself indebted to Crisóstomo.

On the day of the fiesta, Elías warns Crisóstomo of a plot to kill him at the cornerstone ceremony. Sure enough, Crisóstomo evades injury and the would-be assassin is killed. During the luncheon, an uninvited Padre Dámaso further berates Crisóstomo. The other guests hiss for discretion, but Dámaso carries on and insults the memory of Don Rafael. Crisóstomo then loses control, strikes the friar unconscious and holds a knife to his neck. Crisóstomo tells the guests about Dámaso&#x27;s schemes that resulted in his father&#x27;s death, but releases Dámaso when María Clara pleads for mercy. Crisóstomo is excommunicated from the Church, but has it lifted in Manila through the intercession of the sympathetic captain-general. Returning to San Diego, he finds María ill and refusing to see him.

Meanwhile, Elías senses Crisóstomo&#x27;s influence with the government and takes him for a sail so they can talk in private. Elías reveals that a revolutionary group had been trying to recruit him but he stalled in order to get Crisóstomo&#x27;s views first. The conversation shifts to Elías&#x27; family history. It turns out that Elías&#x27; grandfather, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office, but one night a fire consumes the office and the Spanish proprietor accuses him of arson. He was prosecuted and jailed; upon release, he was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife turned to prostitution to support the family. Their lives were ruined.

Crisóstomo says that he cannot help and his school project is his focus. Rebuffed, Elías advises Crisóstomo to avoid him in the future, for his own safety. However, Elías returns a few days later to tell him of a rogue uprising planned for that same night. The instigators had used Crisóstomo&#x27;s name in vain to recruit malcontents. The authorities know of the uprising and are prepared to spring a trap on the rebels. Realizing the scheme&#x27;s repercussions, Crisóstomo abandons his school project and enlists Elías in sorting out and destroying documents that may implicate him. Elías obliges, but comes across a name familiar to him: Don Pedro Eibarramendia. Crisóstomo says Pedro was his great-grandfather and that they had to shorten his long family name. Elías responds that Eibarramendia was the same Spaniard who accused his grandfather of arson, and thus condemned Elías and his family to misfortune. Elias leaves the house in consternation.

The uprising takes place and many of the rebels are captured or killed. They point to Crisóstomo as instructed and he is arrested. The following morning, the instigators are found dead—Padre Salví, the mastermind of the uprising, ordered his senior sexton to kill them in order to silence them. Meanwhile, Elias sneaks back into the Ibarra mansion and sorts through documents and valuables, then burns down the house. Crisóstomo and his co-accused are loaded into horse carts and taken to prison with their townmates shouting in anger and casting stones as they passed.

Kapitán Tiago later on hosts a dinner at his riverside house in Manila to celebrate María Clara&#x27;s engagement with Alfonso Linares, a Peninsular who was presented as her new suitor following Crisóstomo&#x27;s excommunication. Present at the party were Padre Salví, Padre Sibyla, Lieutenant Guevarra, and other acquaintances. They spoke of the events in San Diego and Crisóstomo&#x27;s fate. Salví, who lusted after María Clara all along and staged the uprising in order to frame Crisóstomo, says he requested to be moved to the Convent of the Poor Clares in Manila under the pretense of the San Diego uprising being too much for him.

Guevara outlines how the court came to condemn Crisóstomo. In a signed letter he wrote before leaving for Europe, Crisóstomo spoke of his father, an alleged rebel who died in prison. Somehow this letter fell into the hands of an enemy, and Crisóstomo&#x27;s handwriting was copied to create recruitment letters for the uprising. The signature on the letters was similar to Crisóstomo&#x27;s seven years before, but not at present day. Crisóstomo only had to deny ownership of the signature on the original letter and the case built on the bogus letters would be dismissed. But upon seeing the letter, which was of course his farewell letter to María Clara, Crisóstomo lost the will to fight the charges, and he is sentenced to be deported. Guevara then approaches María who had been listening. Privately but sorrowfully, he congratulates her for her common sense in yielding the letter. Now, she can live a life of peace. María is devastated.

Later that evening Crisóstomo, having escaped prison with the help of Elías, confronts María in secret. María admits giving up his letter because Salví found Dámaso&#x27;s old letters in the San Diego parsonage, letters from María&#x27;s mother who was then pregnant with her and begging Dámaso for an abortion. It turns out that Dámaso was María&#x27;s biological father. Salví promised not to divulge Dámaso&#x27;s letters in exchange for Crisóstomo&#x27;s farewell letter. Crisóstomo forgives her, María swears her undying love, and they part with a kiss.

Crisóstomo and Elías slip unnoticed through the Estero de Binondo and into the Pasig River. Elías tells Crisóstomo that his family treasure is buried at the Ibarra forest in San Diego. Wishing to make restitution, Crisóstomo tells Elías to flee with him to a foreign country where they will live as brothers. Elías declines, stating that his fate lies with the country he wishes to reform. Crisóstomo then tells him of his own desire for revolution to lengths that even Elías was unwilling to go. Just then, sentries catch up with their boat at the mouth of the Pasig River and pursue them across Laguna de Bay. Elías orders Crisóstomo to lie down and to meet him at his family&#x27;s mausoleum in the forest. Elías then jumps into the water to distract the pursuers and is shot several times.

The following day, María reads in the newspapers that Crisóstomo had been killed by sentries in pursuit. She remorsefully demands of Dámaso that her wedding with Linares be cancelled and that she be entered into the cloister, or the grave. Seeing her resolution, Dámaso admits he ruined Crisóstomo because he was a mere &quot;mestizo&quot; and Dámaso wanted María to be happy and secure, and that was possible only if she married a peninsular Spaniard. Knowing why Salví had earlier requested to be assigned to the Convent of the Poor Clares, Dámaso pleads with María to reconsider, but to no avail. Weeping, Dámaso consents, knowing the horrible fate that awaits his daughter within the convent but finding it more tolerable than her suicide.

A few nights later in the Ibarra forest, a boy pursues his mother through the darkness. The woman went insane with the constant beating of her husband, the death of her younger son in the hands of Padre Salví, and the loss of her elder son to the Guardia Civil. Basilio, the boy, catches up with Sisa, his mother, inside the Ibarra mausoleum, but the strain had already been too great for Sisa. She dies in Basilio&#x27;s embrace. As Basilio grieves for his mother, Elías stumbles into the mausoleum, himself dying from his wounds. He instructs Basilio to cremate their bodies and if no one comes, to dig inside the mausoleum, where he will find treasures, which he is to use for his own education.

As Basilio leaves to fetch the wood, Elías sinks to the ground and whispers that he will die without seeing the dawn of freedom for his people, and that those who see it must welcome it and not forget those who died in the darkness. Upon returning, Basilio encounters Ibarra also mourning for Elias. The two build a pyre for them before burying their remains. Following the funeral, Ibarra and Basilio dig the mausoleum for the treasures, which the latter receives a share of. Before letting Basilio leave, Ibarra re-echoes Elias&#x27; dying advice on the use of the treasures to the boy.

Afterwards, it is revealed that Dámaso is transferred to a remote town; distraught, he is found dead a day later. Tiago fell into depression, became addicted to opium and faded to obscurity. Salví, while waiting for his consecration as a bishop, serves as chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares. Meanwhile, during a stormy evening in September, two patrolmen reported seeing a specter on the roof of the convent weeping in despair. The next day, a government representative visited the convent to try to investigate the previous night&#x27;s events. One of the nuns had a wet and torn gown and with tears told the representative of &quot;tales of horror&quot; and begged for &quot;protection against the outrages of hypocrisy&quot; (strongly suggesting that Padre Salví regularly rapes her when he is in the convent). The abbess, however, said that she was mad. A general also attempted to investigate the nun&#x27;s case but by then, the abbess prohibited visits to the convent. Nothing more was said about this nun, or for that matter, María Clara.

==Publication history==
Rizal finished the novel in February 1887. At first, according to one of Rizal&#x27;s biographers, Rizal feared the novel might not be printed, and that it would remain unread. He was struggling with financial constraints at the time and thought it would be hard to pursue printing the novel.

His friend Máximo Viola provided some financial aid, enabling Rizal to have the book printed at Berliner Buchdruckerei-Aktiengesellschaft in Berlin. Viola loaned Rizal ₱300 for 2,000 copies. The printing was finished earlier than the estimated five months. Viola arrived in Berlin in December 1886, and by March 21, 1887, Rizal had sent a copy of the novel to his friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt.

Spanish authorities in the Philippines banned the book, but copies were smuggled into the country. The first Philippine edition (and the second published edition) was printed in 1899 in Manila by Chofre y Compania in Escolta.

===Recent English editions===
On August 21, 2007, a 480-page English-language version of &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; was released to major Australian book stores. Penguin Classics (an imprint by Penguin Books) published this edition in keeping with its &quot;commitment to publish the major literary classics of the world.&quot;

American writer Harold Augenbraum, who first read &quot;Noli&quot; in 1992, had translated the novel. A writer well-acquainted with translating other Spanish-language literary works, Augenbraum proposed to translate the novel. Penguin changed their initial plan of adapting existing English versions and instead commissioned him to make a new translation.

==Reaction and legacy==
This novel and its sequel, &quot;El filibusterismo&quot; (nicknamed &quot;El fili&quot;), were banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines because of their allegations of corruption and abuse by the colonial government and the Catholic Church. Copies of the book were nevertheless smuggled in and hidden, and when Rizal returned to the Philippines after completing medical studies, he quickly ran afoul of the local government. A few days after his arrival, Rizal was summoned to Malacañan Palace by Governor-General Emilio Terrero, who told him of the charge that &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; contained subversive elements. After a discussion, Terrero was appeased but still unable to offer resistance to pressure from the Church against the book. The persecution can be discerned from Rizal&#x27;s letter to Ferdinand Blumentritt:
Rizal was exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao, then later arrested for &quot;inciting rebellion&quot; based largely on his writings. Rizal was executed by firing squad at Bagumbayan outside Manila&#x27;s walls on December 30, 1896, at the age of thirty-five, at the park that now bears his name.

===Influence on Filipino nationalism===
Rizal depicted nationality by emphasizing the positive qualities of Filipinos: the devotion of a Filipina and her influence on a man&#x27;s life, the deep sense of gratitude, and the solid common sense of the Filipinos under the Spanish regime.

The work was instrumental in creating a unified Filipino national identity and consciousness, as many natives previously identified with their respective regions. It lampooned, caricatured and exposed various elements in colonial society. Two characters in particular have become classics in Filipino culture: María Clara, who has become a personification of the ideal Filipino woman, loving and unwavering in her loyalty to her spouse; and the priest Father Dámaso, who reflects the covert fathering of illegitimate children by members of the Spanish clergy.

The book indirectly influenced the Philippine Revolution of independence from the Spanish Empire, even though Rizal actually advocated direct representation to the Spanish government and an overall larger role for the Philippines within Spain&#x27;s political affairs. In 1956, Congress passed Republic Act 1425, more popularly known as the Rizal Law, which requires all levels in Philippine schools to teach the novel as part of their curriculum. &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; is being taught to third-year secondary school (now Grade 9, due to the new K-12 curriculum) students, while its sequel &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; is being taught for fourth-year secondary school (now Grade 10) students. The novels are incorporated to their study and survey of Philippine literature. Both of Rizal&#x27;s novels were initially banned from Catholic educational institutions given its negative portrayal of the Church, but this taboo has been largely superseded as religious schools conformed to the Rizal Law.

==Major characters==

===Crisóstomo Ibarra===
Don Juan Crisóstomo Eibarramendia y Magsalin, commonly referred to in the novel as Ibarra or Crisóstomo, is the novel&#x27;s protagonist. The &quot;mestizo&quot; (mixed-race) son of Filipino businessman Don Rafael Ibarra, he studied in Europe for seven years. Ibarra is also María Clara&#x27;s fiancé.

===María Clara===
María Clara de los Santos y Alba, commonly referred to as María Clara, María, or Clarita, is Ibarra&#x27;s fiancée and the most beautiful and widely celebrated girl in San Diego. She was raised by Kapitán Tiago de los Santos, and his cousin, Isabel. In the later parts of the novel, she was revealed to be an illegitimate daughter of Father Dámaso, the former curate of the town, and Doña Pía Alba, Kapitán Tiago&#x27;s wife, who had died giving birth to María Clara.

At the novel&#x27;s end, a heartbroken yet resolved María Clara entered the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara (a Poor Clare nunnery) after learning the truth of her parentage and mistakenly believing that her lover, Crisóstomo, had been killed. In the epilogue, Rizal stated that it is unknown whether María Clara is still living within the walls of the convent or is already dead.

===Kapitán Tiyago===
Don Santiago de los Santos, known by his nickname Tiyago and political title Kapitán Tiyago, is said to be the richest man in the region of Binondo and possessed real properties in Pampanga and Laguna de Baý. He is also said to be a good Catholic, a friend of the Spanish government and thus was considered a Spaniard by the colonial elite. Kapitán Tiyago never attended school, so he became the domestic helper of a Dominican friar who gave him an informal education. He later married Pía Alba from Santa Cruz.

===Padre Dámaso===

Dámaso Verdolagas, better known as Padre Dámaso, is a Franciscan friar and the former parish curate of San Diego. He is notorious for his brashness and cruelty during his ministry in the town. An enemy of Crisóstomo&#x27;s father Don Rafael Ibarra, Dámaso is revealed to be María Clara&#x27;s biological father. Later, he and María Clara had bitter arguments on whether she would marry Alfonso Linares de Espadaña (which he preferred) or enter the nunnery (her desperate alternative). At the end of the novel, he is again reassigned to a distant town and later found dead in his bed.

===Elías===
Elías is Ibarra&#x27;s mysterious friend and ally. Elías made his first appearance as a pilot during a picnic of Ibarra and María Clara and her friends.

Chapter 50 explores Elías&#x27; family history. Elías&#x27;s grandfather Ingkong, in his youth, worked as a bookkeeper in a Manila office. One night the office burned down, and Don Pedro Eibarramendia, the Spaniard owner, accused him of arson. Ingkong was imprisoned and upon release was shunned by the community as a dangerous lawbreaker. His wife Impong turned to prostitution to support themselves but eventually they were driven into the hinterlands. There Impong bore her first son, Balat.

Driven to depression, Ingkong hangs himself deep in the forest. Impong was sickly for lack of nourishment in the forest and was not strong enough to cut down his corpse and bury him, and Balat was then still very young. The stench led to their discovery, and Impong was accused of killing her husband. She and her son fled to another province where she bore another son.

Balat grew up to be a legendary bandit. When he was finally caught he was cut limb by limb and his head was deposited in front of Impong&#x27;s house. Seeing the severed head of her son, Impong died of shock. Impong&#x27;s younger son, knowing their deaths would somehow be imputed upon him, fled to the province of Tayabas where he met and fell in love with a rich young heiress. They have an affair and the lady got pregnant.

But before they could marry, his records were dug up. Then the father, who disapproved of him from the start, had him imprisoned. The lady gave birth to Elías and his twin sister but died while the two were still children. Nonetheless, the twins were well cared for and doted over by their grandfather. Elías went to Ateneo and his sister to La Concordia, but as they wanted to become farmers they eventually returned to Tayabas.

He and his sister grew up not knowing about their father except that he had died long ago. Elías was an abusive brat who took particular joy in berating an elderly servant who, nevertheless, always submitted to his whims. His sister was more refined and eventually was betrothed to a fine young man. But before they could marry, Elías ran afoul with a distant relative. The verbal scuffle mounted to the point where records were dug up, and Elías and his sister, as well as a good part of town, learned the truth. The elderly servant whom Elías frequently abused was their father.

The scandal caused the engagement of Elías&#x27; sister to break off. Depressed, the girl disappeared one day and was eventually found dead along the seashore. Elías himself lost face and became a wanderer. Like his uncle Balat, he became a bandit, but by degrees he became the gentler, more reserved, and more noble character first introduced in the novel.

===Pilósopo Tasyo===
Also known as Don Anastasio, he was a former student of philosophy. His wealthy mother, not wanting him to forget God, presented him with the choice of entering the priesthood or leaving college. He leaves college, marries his sweetheart, but loses her and his mother in the same year. To ensure he does not fall into depression or vice, he devotes his time on his books and in so doing neglects the wealth his mother left for him. He writes using an invented form of alphabet that is based on the Tagalog language, hoping that the future generations may be able to decipher it.

===Doña Victorina===
Doña Victorina de los Reyes de de Espadaña, commonly known as Doña Victorina, is an ambitious Filipina who classifies herself as a Spaniard and mimics Spanish ladies by putting on heavy make-up. The novel narrates Doña Victorina&#x27;s younger days: she had many admirers, but she spurned them all because none of them were Spaniards. Later on, she met and married Don Tiburcio de Espadaña, an official of the customs bureau ten years her junior. However, their marriage is childless.

Her husband assumes the title of medical &quot;doctor&quot; even though he never attended medical school; using fake documents and certificates, Tiburcio illegally practices medicine. Tiburcio&#x27;s usage of the title &quot;Dr.&quot; consequently makes Victorina assume the title &quot;Dra.&quot; (&quot;doctora&quot;, female doctor). Apparently, she uses the whole name Doña Victorina de los Reyes &quot;de&quot; de Espadaña, with double &quot;de&quot; to emphasize her marriage surname. She seems to feel that this awkward titling makes her more &quot;sophisticated&quot;.

===Sisa, Crispín, and Basilio===
Sisa, Crispín, and Basilio represent a Filipino family persecuted by the Spanish authorities:

*Narcisa, or Sisa, is the deranged mother of Basilio and Crispín. Described as beautiful and young, she loves her children very much but cannot protect them from beatings by her husband, Pedro.
*Crispín is Sisa&#x27;s seven-year-old son. An altar boy, he was unjustly accused of stealing money from the church. The head sexton beats him to force him to &quot;return&quot; the money. Basilio dreams that Crispín dies of the beating. 
*Basilio is Sisa&#x27;s 10-year-old son. An acolyte tasked with ringing the church&#x27;s bells for the Angelus, he faced the dread of Crispín&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s descent into insanity. Elías asked him to cremate his and Sisa&#x27;s body after revealing the location of Ibarra&#x27;s treasure. He later played a major role in the sequel, &quot;El filibusterismo&quot;.

Due to their tragic but endearing story, these characters are often parodied in modern Filipino popular culture.

*Salomé is Elías&#x27; sweetheart. She lived in a little house by the lake, and though Elías would like to marry her, he tells her that it would do her or their children no good to be related to a fugitive like himself. In the original publication of &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot;, the chapter that explores the identity of Elías and Salomé was omitted, classifying her as a totally non-existent character. This chapter, titled &quot;Elías y Salomé&quot;, was probably the 25th chapter of the novel. However, recent editions and translations of &quot;Noli&quot; include this chapter either on the appendix or as &quot;Chapter X&quot; (Ex).

==Other characters==
There are several secondary and minor characters in &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot;. Names indicated in parentheses are the standard Filipinisation of Spanish names in the novel.

*Padre Hernándo de la Sibyla – a short and fair-skinned Dominican friar. He is instructed by an old priest in his order to observe and see Crisóstomo Ibarra&#x27;s doings.
*Padre Bernardo Salví – a Franciscan friar who succeeded Damaso as curate of San Diego. He lusts after María Clara. He is described to be very thin and sickly. It is also hinted that his surname, &quot;Salví&quot;, is the shorter form of &quot;salvación&quot; (&quot;salvation&quot;), or that &quot;Salví&quot; is short for &quot;salvaje&quot; (&quot;savage&quot;, &quot;wild&quot;), hinting at the fact that he is willing to kill an innocent child, Crispín, whom he accused of stealing money worth two &quot;onzas&quot;.
*El Alférez – the unnamed chief of the local &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; and husband of Doña Consolación. He is the sworn enemy of the priests in the town&#x27;s power struggle.
*Doña Consolación – wife of the &quot;Alférez&quot;, nicknamed as &quot;la musa de los guardias civiles&quot; (&quot;the muse of the Civil Guard&quot;) or &quot;la Alféreza&quot;. She was a former laundrywoman who passes herself as a &quot;peninsular&quot;, and is best remembered for her abusive treatment of Sisa.
*Don Tiburcio de Espadaña – A Spanish quack doctor who is weak and submissive to his pretentious wife, Doña Victorina.
*Teniente Guevara – lieutenant of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;, a close friend of Don Rafael Ibarra. He reveals to Crisóstomo the circumstances of Don Rafael&#x27;s death.
*Alfonso Linares – A distant nephew of Tiburcio de Espadaña who would later become the fiancé of María Clara. Although he presented himself as a practitioner of law, it was later revealed that he is, like Don Tiburcio, a fraud. He later died from medications Don Tiburcio had given him.
*Tíya Isabel – Kapitán Tiago&#x27;s cousin, who helped raise María Clara and served as a surrogate mother figure.
*Capitan-General – Unnamed in the novel, he is the most powerful colonial official in the Philippines. He harbors great disdain for the friars and corrupt officials, and sympathizes with Ibarra.
*Don Filipo Lino – vice-mayor of the town of San Diego, leader of the liberals.
*Padre Manuel Martín – he is the linguist curate of a nearby town who delivers the sermon during San Diego&#x27;s fiesta.
*Don Rafael Ibarra – Crisóstomo Ibarra&#x27;s father. Though he was the richest man in San Diego, he was also the most virtuous and generous. Thus he stepped on the toes of the elite who then conspired to destroy him.
*Doña Pía Alba – wife of Kapitán Tiago and mother of María Clara; she died giving birth to her daughter. Kapitán Tiago was officially the child&#x27;s father, but in reality, Alba was raped by Padre Dámaso.
*Don Pedro Eibarramendia – Crisóstomo Ibarra&#x27;s Basque great-grandfather who falsely accused Elías&#x27;s grandfather and ruined his family. The surname was later shortened to &quot;Ibarra&quot;.
*Albino – a seminarian who follows Crisóstomo Ibarra in a picnic with María Clara&#x27;s friends.
*Don Saturnino Eibarramendia – the father of Don Rafael and grandfather of Crisóstomo who is said to have founded the town of San Diego when it was still a vast forest.
*Luis Chiquito – He is a businessman who is friends with Padre Martin, Kapitan Tiago, and another businessman named Martin Aristorena.

<text>The Staten Island Railway (SIR) is a railroad line in the New York City borough of Staten Island. It is owned by the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority (SIRTOA), a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and operated by the New York City Transit Authority Department of Subways. SIR operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing local service between St. George and Tottenville, along the east side of the island. There is currently only one line on the island, and there is no direct rail link between the SIR and the New York City Subway system, but SIR riders do receive a free transfer to New York City Transit bus and subway lines, and the line is included on official New York City Subway maps. Commuters on the railway typically use the Staten Island Ferry to reach Manhattan. The line is accessible from within the Ferry Terminal, and most of its trains are timed to connect with the ferry. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The line has a route bullet similar to subway routes: the letters &quot;SIR&quot; in a blue circle. It is used on timetables, the MTA website, some signage, and on R211S trains, but not on R44 trains. Like the New York City Subway, the line runs 24 hours a day every day of the year, and is one of the few 24/7 mass-transit rail systems in the United States. Fares are only collected at two stations, St. George and nearby Tompkinsville.

Although the railway was originally considered a standard rail line, the existing line is severed from the national rail system, and only a small portion of the former North Shore Branch still sees freight use. The passenger operations are now regulated as a rapid transit system, and exempt from certain regulations. The line uses modified R44 and R211S subway cars, the latter of which will replace the R44s throughout 2024 and 2025.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===
The Staten Island Rail Road was incorporated on August 2, 1851, after Perth Amboy and Staten Island residents petitioned for a Tottenville-to-Stapleton rail line. The railroad was financed with a loan from Cornelius Vanderbilt, the sole Staten Island-to-Manhattan ferry operator on the East Shore, his first involvement in a railroad. The line was completed to Tottenville on June 2, 1860. Under the leadership of Vanderbilt&#x27;s brother, Jacob H. Vanderbilt, the Staten Island Rail Road took over several independent ferries. The Staten Island Railway and ferry line made a modest profit until the explosion of the ferry &quot;Westfield&quot; at Whitehall Street Terminal on July 30, 1871. By July 1872, the railroad and ferry were in receivership. On September 17, 1872, the company was sold to George Law in foreclosure. The following April 1, the Staten Island Rail Road was transferred to the Staten Island Railway Company.

By 1880 the railway was barely operational, and New York State sued (through Attorney General Hamilton Ward) to dissolve the company in May of that year. Erastus Wiman, one of the island&#x27;s most prominent residents, organized the Staten Island Rapid Transit Company (SIRT) on March 25, 1880, and partnered with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) to build a large rail terminal on the island and centralize the six-to-eight ferry landings. He secured an extension on a land-purchase option from George Law by offering to name it &quot;St. George&quot; after him.

Construction of the Vanderbilt&#x27;s Landing-to-Tompkinsville portion of the North Shore Branch began on March 17, 1884, and the line opened for passenger service on August 1 of that year. The lighthouse just above Tompkinsville impeded the line&#x27;s extension to St. George but, after the SIRT lobbied for an act of Congress, construction of a two-track, tunnel under the lighthouse began in 1885 for about $190,000. The SIR was leased to the B&amp;O for 99 years in 1885. Proceeds of the lease were used to complete the terminal at Saint George, pay for two miles of waterfront property, complete the Rapid Transit Railroad, build a bridge over the Kill Van Kull at Elizabethport, and build other terminal facilities. The North Shore Branch opened for service on February 23, 1886, to Elm Park. The Saint George terminal opened on March 7, 1886, and all SIR lines were extended to the station. The remainder of the North Shore Branch, to its terminus at Erastina, was opened in the summer of 1886. On January 1, 1888, the South Beach Branch opened for passenger service to Arrochar. In 1893, the South Beach Branch was extended from Arrochar to a new terminal at South Beach. The new lines opened by the B&amp;O were known as the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railway, and the original line (from Clifton to Tottenville) was called the Staten Island Railway.

In 1886, Congress passed a law authorizing the construction of a swing bridge over Arthur Kill, after three years of effort by Wiman. The bridge was completed three days early, on June 13, 1888, at 3 p.m. The Arthur Kill Bridge was the world&#x27;s largest drawbridge when it opened, and there were no fatalities in its construction. In 1889, construction began on the Baltimore and New York Railway— line from Arthur Kill to the Jersey Central at Cranford, and was finished later in the year. On January 1, 1890, the first train operated from St. George Terminal to Cranford Junction. When the Arthur Kill Bridge was completed, the United States War Department was unsuccessfully pressured by the Lehigh Valley and Pennsylvania Railroads to have the newly built bridge replaced with a bridge with a different design; according to the railroads, it was an obstruction to navigation of the large numbers of coal barges past Holland Hook on Arthur Kill. In 1897, the terminal at Saint George (which served the railroad and the ferry to Manhattan) was completed.

=== 20th century ===
Improvements were made to the SIRT after the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) took control of the B&amp;O in 1900, after which the B&amp;O became profitable again. On October 25, 1905, New York City took ownership of the ferry and terminals and evicted the B&amp;O from the Whitehall Street terminal. The St. George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720, .

In anticipation of a tunnel under the Narrows to Brooklyn and a connection there with the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, the SIRT electrified its lines with third rail power distribution and cars similar to those of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). The first electric train was operated on the South Beach Branch between South Beach and Fort Wadsworth on May 30, 1925, and the other branches were electrified by November of that year. Electrification did not greatly increase traffic, and the tunnel was never built. During the 1920s, a branch line along Staten Island&#x27;s West Shore was built to haul building materials for the Outerbridge Crossing. The branch was cut back to a point south of the crossing after the bridge was built. The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and tank farm along Arthur Kill in 1928; to serve it, the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island&#x27;s western shore to Gulfport in the early 1930s.

The Port Richmond–Tower Hill viaduct, the nation&#x27;s largest grade-crossing-elimination project, was completed on February 25, 1937. The viaduct, more than a mile long, spanned eight grade crossings on the SIRT&#x27;s North Shore Branch and was the final part of a $6 million grade-crossing-elimination project on the island which eliminated thirty-four crossings on its north and south shores.

Freight and World War II traffic helped pay some of the SIRT&#x27;s accumulated debt, and the line was briefly profitable in the 1940s. All East Coast military-hospital trains were handled by the SIRT during the war, and some trains stopped at Staten Island&#x27;s Arlington station to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war materiel, POW trains and troops made the stretch of the Baltimore &amp; New York Railway between Cranford Junction and Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B&amp;O also operated special trains for important officials, such as Winston Churchill. On June 25, 1946, a fire destroyed the St. George Terminal; three people were killed, twenty-two were injured and damage totaled $22 million. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal, the four slips used for service to Manhattan and the SIRT terminal. Normal service was not restored until July 13, 1946, and a request for bids to build a temporary terminal was issued on August 21 of that year. On February 10, 1948, a replacement terminal was promised by Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer. The new $23 million terminal opened on June 8, 1951, with ferry, bus and rail service in one building; portions of the new terminal were phased into service earlier.


Ridership decreased from 12.3 million in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949 as passengers switched from the rail line to city-operated buses due to a bus-fare reduction. In September 1948, about half of weekday trains were cut, night trains after 1:29 a.m. were cancelled, and thirty percent of the company&#x27;s employees were laid off. After backlash, service was slightly increased. On September 22, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16. SIRT discontinued passenger service on the North Shore Branch and the South Beach Branch at midnight on March 31, 1953, due to competition from city-operated buses; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly afterwards, and the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. On September 7, 1954, SIRT applied to discontinue passenger service on the Tottenville Branch on October 7 of that year; a large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the branch to continue.

In 1956, work began on the replacement of the Arthur Kill swing bridge by a single-track, vertical-lift bridge, which opened in August 1959. The prefabricated, 2,000-ton bridge was floated into place. The new bridge could rise and, since it aided navigation on Arthur Kill, the federal government assumed 90% of the project&#x27;s $11 million cost. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959. The Travis Branch was extended in 1958 to a new Consolidated Edison power plant in Travis (on the West Shore), allowing coal trains from West Virginia to serve the plant.

Operation of the Tottenville line was turned over to the Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority (a division of the state&#x27;s Metropolitan Transportation Authority) on July 1, 1971, and the line was purchased by the city of New York. As part of the agreement, freight on the line would continue to be handled by the B&amp;O under the Staten Island Railroad. The first six R44 cars (the same as the newest cars then in use on the subway lines in the other boroughs) were put into SIRT service on February 28, 1973, replacing the ME-1 cars which had been in service since 1925. Between 1971 and 1973, a project began to extend the high-level platforms at six stations. A station-rebuilding program began in 1985, and the line&#x27;s R44s were overhauled starting in 1987.

The B&amp;O became part of the larger Chessie System in a merger with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), and the island&#x27;s freight operation was renamed the Staten Island Railroad Corporation in 1971. The B&amp;O and C&amp;O became isolated from their other properties in New Jersey and Staten Island with the creation of Conrail on April 1, 1976, in a merger of bankrupt lines in the northeastern U.S. Their freight service now terminated in Philadelphia, but for several years afterward B&amp;O locomotives and one B&amp;O freight train a day ran to Cranford Junction. In 1973, the Jersey Central&#x27;s car float yard was closed; however, the B&amp;O&#x27;s car-float operation was later brought back to Staten Island at Saint George Yard, after having ended in September 1976. This car-float operation was taken over by the New York Dock Railway in September 1979, and ended the following year.

Only a few isolated industries on Staten Island continued to use rail services, and the yard at Saint George was essentially abandoned. In April 1985, as a result of a decline in freight traffic, the Chessie System sold the Staten Island Railway to the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (NYS&amp;W), a Delaware Otsego (DO) subsidiary, for $1.5 million via a promissory note payable for over ten years. The NYS&amp;W subsequently retained the Staten Island&#x27;s freight operations, which served only ten customers by that time, and they had hopes of attracting more to boost profitability on the line. In 1989, the NYS&amp;W embargoed the trackage east of Elm Park on the North Shore Branch, ending all freight service to Saint George.

Procter &amp; Gamble, the line&#x27;s primary customer, closed in 1990, resulting in a further decline in freight traffic. On July 25, 1991, the Arthur Kill Bridge was removed from service, and the line&#x27;s final freight train operated on April 21, 1992. The North Shore Branch and the Arthur Kill Bridge were then taken over by Chessie&#x27;s successor, CSX Transportation (CSX). The line and bridge were sold again in 1994 to the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), followed by a decade of false starts.

SIRT was transferred from the New York City Transit Authority&#x27;s Surface Transit Division to its Department of Rapid Transit on July 26, 1993, and that year the Dongan Hills station became accessible, making it compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. MetroCards were accepted for fare payment at the St. George station beginning on March 31, 1994, and the station became the 50th MTA rapid transit station to accept them. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) restored the line&#x27;s original name on April 2 of that year as the MTA Staten Island Railway (SIR). On July 4, 1997, the MTA eliminated fares for travel between Tompkinsville and Tottenville as part of the year&#x27;s &quot;One City, One Fare&quot; fare reductions. United Transportation Union Local 1440, the union representing SIR employees, was concerned about the fare reduction in part because of an expected increase in ridership. No turnstiles were installed at the other stations on the line, and passengers at St. George began paying when entering and exiting; fares had previously been collected on board by the conductor. The removal of fares was blamed for an immediate spike in crime along the line. Three afternoon express trains were added to the schedule on April 7, 1999, nearly doubling the previous express service. The express trains skipped stops between St. George and Great Kills. A several-hundred-foot section of the easternmost portion of the North Shore Branch was reopened for passenger service to the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, home of the Staten Island Yankees minor-league baseball team, on June 24, 2001; the service was discontinued on June 18, 2010. A new station building at Tompkinsville opened on January 20, 2010, with turnstiles installed to prevent passengers from exiting (free of charge) at Tompkinsville and walking the short distance to the St. George ferry terminal.

== Current use ==

=== Passenger service ===
Although the Staten Island Railway originally consisted of three lines, only the north-south Main Line is in passenger service. It has been grade-separated from all roads since the 1960s, but runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville—the end of the line. The terminus at St. George provides a direct connection with the Staten Island Ferry. St. George has twelve tracks, ten of which are in service. Tottenville has a three-track yard to the east of the station, which itself has two tracks and an island platform.

Rolling stock consists of modified R44 subway-type cars built in early 1973, added to the end of the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit; they were the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company. They are being replaced by seventy-five R211S subway cars manufactured by Kawasaki Railcar Manufacturing, which entered service on October 8, 2024. The line also has four BL20G locomotives manufactured by Brookville, which were delivered in 2009 and are used for work service. Heavy maintenance is performed at NYCT&#x27;s Clifton Shops, and any work unable to be done at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the subway&#x27;s Coney Island Complex in Brooklyn. The right-of-way includes elevated, embankment and open-cut sections, as well as a tunnel near St. George.

The Staten Island Railway uses Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad-style color position light signals dating back to its B&amp;O days. In 2007, a $72-million project to enhance the old signal system was completed. The Signaling system was enhanced with an FRA-compliant 100 Hz, track-circuit-based automatic train control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with onboard cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and backup control center were built as part of the project. The line uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third-rail power. Trains run up to in passenger service, although trains are limited to on tail tracks, sidings and in yards.

Demetrius Crichlow has been the railway&#x27;s president and chief officer since his appointment in October 2024. The workforce, about 200 hourly employees, is represented by United Transportation Union Local 1440.
==== Accessibility ====
Only the Dongan Hills, St. George, Great Kills, New Dorp and Tottenville stations have been renovated to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; these stations have elevators and/or ramps. As part of the MTA&#x27;s 2020–2024 capital plan, two additional stations are planned to be renovated to become ADA-accessible, Huguenot and Clifton.

The Prince&#x27;s Bay, Huguenot, Annadale, Great Kills, Dongan Hills, and Arthur Kill stations have park-and-ride facilities. The newest station on the Staten Island Railway, Arthur Kill, opened on January 21, 2017, and is ADA-compliant. The station is between (and has replaced) the now-demolished Atlantic and Nassau stations, which were in the poorest condition of all the stations on the line.

==== Police ====
On June 1, 2005, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Police Department was disbanded and its 25 railroad police officers became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department. The MTA Police Department was created in 1998 with the merger of the Long Island Rail Road Police Department and the Metro-North Railroad Police Department. The MTA Police Department then opened its newest patrol district, Police District #9, which began covering the Staten Island Railway.

==== Fare ====

The cash fare is $2.90, the same fare as the New York City Subway and MTA buses. Fares are paid on entry and exit only at St. George and Tompkinsville. Rides not originating or terminating at St. George or Tompkinsville are free. Fares are payable by MetroCard or OMNY. Since the card enables free transfers for a continuous ride on the subway and bus systems, for many riders there is effectively no fare for riding the SIR, as long as they do not need to make a second transfer. Riders can also transfer between a Staten Island bus, the SIR and a Manhattan bus (or subway) near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR&#x27;s 2001 farebox recovery ratio was 0.16; for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares (the lowest ratio of MTA agencies). The low farebox recovery ratio is part of the reason the MTA sought to merge the SIR with the subway to form MTA Subways in October 2002: to simplify accounting and subsidy of a single line.

Before the 1997 introduction of the one-fare zone, with the MetroCard&#x27;s free transfers from the SIR to the subway system and MTA buses, fares were collected from passengers boarding at stops other than St. George by onboard conductors. In the past, passengers had avoided paying the fare by exiting at Tompkinsville and walking a short distance to the St. George Ferry Terminal. As a result, the MTA installed turnstiles at Tompkinsville and a new station building, which opened on January 20, 2010.

On October 23, 2017, it was announced that the MetroCard would be phased out and replaced by OMNY, a contactless fare payment system also by Cubic, with fare payment being made using Apple Pay, Google Pay, debit/credit cards with near-field communication technology, or radio-frequency identification cards. The St. George and Tompkinsville stations, the only two Staten Island Railway stations with turnstiles, received OMNY readers in December 2019.

=== Freight service ===

During the early 2000s, plans to reopen the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were announced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. So all New England and southern freight could pass through the New York metropolitan area, two rail tunnels from Brooklyn (one to Staten Island and the other to Greenville, New Jersey) were planned.

On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and repair the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge was announced by the NYCEDC and the PANYNJ. Projects on the Arthur Kill Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating its lift mechanism. In 2006, the freight line connection reopened from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railroad, including the Arthur Kill Bridge. Regular service began on April 2, 2007 (16 years after it had closed) to ship container freight from the Howland Hook Marine Terminal and other industrial businesses. The service at the marine terminal is part of the PANYNJ&#x27;s ExpressRail system completed with of the single-track Chemical Coast connector. Service is provided by and Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) for its co-owners, CSX, Norfolk Southern Railway.

As part of the project, a portion of the North Shore Branch was rehabilitated, the Arlington Yard was expanded, and of new track was laid along the Travis Branch to Staten Island Transfer Station at Fresh Kills. Soon after service restarted on the line, Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially commemorated the reactivation on April 17, 2007. As of 2019, the New York City Department of Sanitation&#x27;s contractor was moving containers of municipal solid waste by barge from Queens and Manhattan to the Howland Hook Marine Terminal for transfer to rail there.

Along the remainder of the North Shore Branch, there are still tracks and rail overpasses in some places.

== Future plans ==

Elected officials on Staten Island, including State Senator Diane Savino, have demanded the replacement of the railway&#x27;s aging R44 cars. Although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority initially planned to order R179s for the Staten Island Railway, it was later decided to overhaul R46s to replace the R44s. However, the R46 overhaul plan was also dropped, and 75 R211S cars will replace the R44s. In the meantime, the R44s are receiving intermittent rounds of scheduled maintenance to extend their usefulness until at least 2025.

There has been discussion of building an in-fill station in the Rosebank neighborhood, which would bridge the longest gap between two stations (Grasmere and Clifton). The area was once home to the Rosebank station on the railway&#x27;s now-defunct South Beach Branch, which was located east of the proposed station site.

Several proposals have been made to connect the SIR to the subway system, including the abandoned, unfinished Staten Island Tunnel and a line along the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge using B Division cars and loading gauge, but economic, political and engineering difficulties have prevented these projects from realization.

=== Possible branch restoration ===
In a 2006 report, the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; explored the restoration of passenger service on of the North Shore Branch between St. George and Arlington. Completion of a study is necessary to qualify the project for an estimated $360 million. A preliminary study found that ridership could reach 15,000 daily. U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York requested $4 million of federal funding for a detailed feasibility study. In 2012, the MTA released an analysis of North Shore transportation solutions which included proposals for the reintroduction of heavy rail, light rail or bus rapid transit using the North Shore line&#x27;s right-of-way. Other options included system management, which would improve existing bus service, and the possibility of future ferry and water taxi service. Bus rapid transit was preferred for its cost ($352 million in capital investment) and relative ease of implementation. In January 2018, the project had yet to receive funding. As part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, $4 million was allocated for an analysis of Staten Island light rail.

: Some local trains start at Huguenot during morning rush hours.

=== Former stations ===

==== North Shore Branch ====
The North Shore Branch closed to passenger service at midnight on March 31, 1953. A small portion of the western end is used for freight service as part of the ExpressRail intermodal network at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal. The network, which opened in 2007, connects to the Chemical Coast after crossing the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge. The North Shore Branch served Procter &amp; Gamble, United States Gypsum, shipbuilders and a car float at Saint George Yard. A smaller eastern portion, which provided seasonal passenger service to the Richmond County Bank Ballpark station (where the Staten Island Yankees played), operated from June 24, 2001, to June 18, 2010. In 2008, restoration was discussed along the mostly abandoned line as part of the island&#x27;s light-rail plan. An environmental impact assessment is being worked on for the implementation of a bus rapid transit line on the North Shore Branch.


==== South Beach Branch ====
The South Beach Branch opened on January 1, 1888, to Arrochar, and was extended to South Beach in 1893. The branch closed at midnight on March 31, 1953. It was abandoned and demolished, except for a few segments: a concrete embankment at Clayton Street and Saint John&#x27;s Avenue, the Tompkins Avenue overpass, trestle over Robin Road in Arrochar and a filled-in bridge under McClean Avenue. This line left the Main Line at (south of the Clifton station), and was east of the Main Line. Although the right-of-way has been redeveloped, most of it is still traceable on maps; Lily Pond Avenue is built over the right of way where it passes under the Staten Island Expressway.

The Robin Road trestle is the only remaining intact trestle along the former line. Developers purchased the land on either side of its abutments during the early 2000s, and the developers, the New York City Department of Transportation, and the New York City Transit Authority all claimed ownership. Townhouses have been built on both sides of the trestle.


=== Freight lines ===
==== Travis Branch ====
The Travis Branch, from Arlington Yard to Fresh Kills, runs along the island&#x27;s West Shore. The branch was built in 1928 to serve Gulf Oil along the Arthur Kill, south from Arlington Yard into the marshes to Gulfport. It was extended to Travis to serve the new Consolidated Edison power plant in 1957. In 2005, the branch was renovated and extended from the old Con Edison plant to the Staten Island Transfer Station at Fresh Kills; regular service to the transfer station began in April 2007.

==== Mount Loretto Spur ====
The Mount Loretto Spur is an abandoned branch whose purpose was to serve the Mount Loretto Children&#x27;s Home. The spur diverged from the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains. The B&amp;O Railroad served the non-electrified branch, which had some industry and a passenger station, until 1950. Although its track was removed during the 1960s and 1970s, some ties were visible until the 1980s. A coal trestle is all that remains of the branch.

==== West Shore Line ====
South of the Richmond Valley station, a non-electrified spur, branched off the Tottenville-bound track. The spur, built in 1928, was called the West Shore Line by the B&amp;O Railroad and delivered building materials to the Outerbridge Crossing construction site near Arthur Kill. Years later, the track was used to serve a scrapyard owned by the Roselli Brothers. This siding went out of service on June 14, 2011. The track divided in two under Page Avenue, with the rails still in place. The line&#x27;s right-of-way, an easement on property owned by Nassau Metals, was later used by CSX. Although sections of the old tracks have been removed, others remain in the overgrowth.

<doc id="317153" wikidata="Q20901295" url="?curid=317153" title="Ministry of foreign affairs">
<text>In many countries, the ministry of foreign affairs (abbreviated as MFA or MOFA) is the highest government department exclusively or primarily responsible for the state&#x27;s foreign policy and relations, diplomacy, bilateral, and multilateral relations affairs as well as for providing support, including consular services, for a country&#x27;s citizens who are abroad. The entity is usually headed by a foreign minister or minister of foreign affairs (the title may vary, such as secretary of state who has the same functions). The foreign minister typically reports to the head of government (such as prime minister or president).

==Difference in titles==
In some nations, such as India, the foreign minister is referred to as the minister for external affairs; or others, such as Brazil and the states created from the former Soviet Union, call the position the minister of external relations. In the United States, the secretary of state is the member of the Cabinet who handles foreign relations. Other common titles may include minister of foreign relations. In many countries of Latin America, the foreign minister is colloquially called &quot;chancellor&quot; (&quot;canciller&quot; in the Spanish-speaking countries and &quot;chanceler&quot; in the Portuguese-speaking Brazil).

Diplomats, themselves, and historians often refer to the foreign ministry by its local address, for example, the Ballhausplatz in Vienna housed the Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary; the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris for France&#x27;s Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs; the South Block in New Delhi for India&#x27;s Ministry of External Affairs; the Necessidades Palace in Lisbon for Portugal&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Wilhelmstraße, in Berlin, was the location of the German Foreign Office; and Foggy Bottom, a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., houses the Department of State. The Ministry of External Relations of Brazil is often referred as the &quot;Itamaraty&quot; due to the two homonymous palaces that served as its headquarters, the original one in Rio de Janeiro (1899–1970) and the present Itamaraty Palace (since 1970) in Brasília. Indonesians also often refer to their Ministry of Foreign Affairs as &quot;Pejambon&quot;, since the ministry&#x27;s main headquarters is located at Pejambon Street, Central Jakarta. During the Russian Empire, which lasted until 1917, the term used was the Choristers&#x27; Bridge in Saint Petersburg. In contrast, the Italian ministry was called the Consulta.

==Powers of position==
A foreign minister&#x27;s powers vary from government to government. In a classic parliamentary system, a foreign minister can potentially exert significant influence in forming foreign policy but when the government is dominated by a strong prime minister, the foreign minister may be limited to playing a more marginal or subsidiary role in determining policy. Similarly, the political powers invested in the foreign minister are often more limited in presidential governments with a strong executive branch. Since the end of World War II, it has been common for both the foreign minister and defense minister to be part of an inner cabinet (commonly known as a national security council) in order to coordinate defense and diplomatic policy. Although the 19th and early 20th centuries saw many heads of government assume the foreign ministry, this practice has since become uncommon in most developed nations.

In some countries, the foreign minister is typically among the highest profiles of cabinet positions. For instance, in the US, its foreign minister is the first member of cabinet in line for the presidential line of succession (with the vice president, speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and president pro-tempore of the United States Senate ahead of the foreign minister). The UK&#x27;s foreign secretary belongs to the four Great Offices of State (along with the prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer, and home secretary).

==Responsibilities==
Along with their political roles, foreign ministers are also traditionally responsible for many diplomatic duties, such as hosting foreign world leaders and going on state visits to other countries. The foreign minister is generally the most well-traveled member of any cabinet.

* In the United Kingdom, the minister responsible for foreign policy (as well as the British Overseas Territories) is the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development affairs (Foreign Secretary). Before 1968, the secretary of state for foreign affairs only handled relations with foreign (non-Commonwealth) countries, while relations with Commonwealth countries and colonies were handled by the secretary of state for Commonwealth affairs. For the same reason, in Commonwealth countries other than the United Kingdom, the ministers responsible for handling relations with both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries were formerly usually designated ministers for external affairs.
* In the United States, the secretary of state handles foreign policy and is the senior Cabinet officer. The name of the post comes from several domestic duties.

Although it is very rare for there to be any sub-national foreign minister post, sometimes there is a minor external relations position. The European Union has dealt with external relations in certain areas since its inception (see EU Trade Commissioner) and has a high representative as its chief diplomat. However, his or her duties are primarily to implement EU foreign policy, rather than formulate it.

<doc id="317155" wikidata="Q1430720" url="?curid=317155" title="Acapulco International Airport">
<text>Acapulco International Airport (), officially &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional General Juan N. Álvarez&quot; (General Juan N. Álvarez International Airport) , is an international airport located in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. It serves as a gateway to Acapulco, a popular Mexican tourist destination. The airport also serves charter flights and facilitates various tourism-related activities, flight training, and general aviation. It is named in honor of Juan N. Álvarez, former President of Mexico. The airport is operated by Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte (OMA). In 2023, the airport handled 894,012 passengers; traffic went down to 606,610 in 2024 due to the impact of Hurricane Otis.

== History ==
In 1929, commercial flights began in Acapulco, near &quot;Playa Hornos&quot; in the city center. Aeronaves de Mexico (now Aeromexico) initiated its operations in 1934, using a single Stinson SR aircraft for flights between Mexico City and Acapulco. However, the initial location posed safety challenges, leading to the construction of a safer airport in Pie de la Cuesta in 1945.

=== Jetset era ===
Acapulco Airport has played a significant role in the development of tourism in southern Mexico. Acapulco, a well-established coastal tourist destination in Mexico, experienced a period of high popularity from the 1940s to the 1970s. It became the preferred destination for the Jetset, Hollywood celebrities, and wealthy individuals seeking exclusive beach vacations in an exotic setting. During this surge in popularity, the decision was made to construct a new airport and transfer the &quot;Pie de la Cuesta&quot; facilities to the Mexican Air Force, now known as Air Force Base No. 7.

The current Acapulco Airport, constructed in 1954, is situated southeast of the city center, positioned between &quot;Tres Palos&quot; Lagoon and the Pacific Ocean in a zone known as &quot;Plan de los Amates&quot;. It was once considered a pioneering model for subsequent airport constructions due to its modern passenger terminal design and the fact that it was one of the first airports built with comprehensive planning and foresight.

The Acapulco Airport received flights from numerous international destinations, primarily from the United States and Canada. It was one of the few airports, apart from Mexico City, that was served by major United States airlines such as Eastern, Braniff, and American. For a brief period, it was a stopover on the Kangaroo air route connecting Australia and the United Kingdom via the Eastern Hemisphere. This route, known as the &quot;Fiesta&quot; route, involved flights from London to Sydney with layovers in Bermuda, Nassau, Mexico City, Acapulco, Tahiti, and Fiji in 1965. Several other airlines, including Delta, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, Alitalia, LTU, Northwest, US Airways, Western, Mexicana, and Aeromar, have also operated at this airport.

Between 1970 and 1973, the airport underwent significant construction and improvement projects, including the construction of a new, air-conditioned passenger terminal, a new parking area, an access road, a control tower, an apron, taxiways, perimeter roads, fencing, and facilities for fuel storage.

=== 21st century ===
However, in the 21st century, the Mexican Drug War has had a detrimental effect on tourism in Acapulco, resulting in a decline in the airport&#x27;s importance as an international gateway. The airport reached its peak in terms of passenger numbers in 2008 but has since been experiencing a decline. In 2018, the terminal was renovated, with the construction of a new terminal building adjacent to the old one, with plans to eventually demolish the old structure.

Furthermore, the airport has been subjected to the impact of hurricanes on multiple occasions. In 2013, Tropical Storm Manuel led to severe flooding at the airport, which forced the suspension of airport activities for several days. In 2023, Hurricane Otis, classified as a Category 5 hurricane, caused extensive damage at the airport when it made landfall nearby.
== Facilities ==
The airport covers an area of . It is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level. The airport has two runways: Runway 06/24, which is long and wide, and Runway 10/28, which is long and wide. Both runways can accommodate up to 40 operations per hour, and the airport can handle jets as large as the Boeing 747. Additionally, the airport has six taxiways leading to an apron with 18 parking positions.

The passenger terminal is a two-story building with a total floor area of and an annual passenger capacity of 1.3 million. It combines concrete and steel structures with extensive interior and exterior gardens, sleek windows, high ceilings, and steel accents in clear geometric shapes.The main hall serves essential functions, including check-in and baggage handling on the eastern side, and the arrivals section on the west side, which includes customs and immigration facilities. The arrivals section also offers car rental services, taxi stands, snack bars, and souvenir shops. The upper floor of the terminal houses the security checkpoint and a departure lounge equipped with a food court, duty-free shops, a VIP lounge, and a concourse with six gates, three of which are equipped with jet bridges.

Adjacent to the terminal, there are other facilities such as civil aviation hangars, cargo and logistics companies, and courier services. Additionally, there is a dedicated general aviation terminal that supports various activities, including tourism, flight training, executive aviation, and general aviation.

<text>Floyd Bennett Field is an airfield in the Marine Park neighborhood of southeast Brooklyn in New York City, along the shore of Jamaica Bay. The airport originally hosted commercial and general aviation traffic before being used as a naval air station. Floyd Bennett Field is currently part of the Gateway National Recreation Area&#x27;s Jamaica Bay Unit, and is managed by the National Park Service (NPS). While no longer used as an operational commercial, military, or general aviation airfield, a section is still used as a helicopter base by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and one runway is reserved for hobbyists flying radio-controlled aircraft.

Floyd Bennett Field was created by connecting Barren Island and several smaller islands to the rest of Brooklyn by filling the channels between them with sand pumped from the bottom of Jamaica Bay. The airport was named after Floyd Bennett, a noted aviator who piloted the first plane to fly over the North Pole and had visualized an airport at Barren Island before dying in 1928; construction on Floyd Bennett Field started the same year. The airport was dedicated on June 26, 1930, and officially opened to commercial flights on May 23, 1931. Despite the exceptional quality of its facilities, Floyd Bennett Field never received much commercial traffic, and it was used instead for general aviation. During the interwar period, dozens of aviation records were set by aviators flying to or from Floyd Bennett Field.

Starting in the 1930s, the United States Coast Guard and United States Navy occupied part of the airport. With the outbreak of World War II, Floyd Bennett Field became part of Naval Air Station New York on June 2, 1941, and Floyd Bennett Field was a hub for naval activities during World War II. After the war, the airfield remained a naval air station operated as a Naval Air Reserve installation. In 1970, the Navy stopped using NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field, though a non-flying Naval Reserve Center remained until 1983. The Coast Guard continued to maintain Coast Guard Air Station Brooklyn for helicopter operations that remained through 1998 when it, too, was decommissioned. Following the Navy&#x27;s departure, several plans for the use of Floyd Bennett Field were proposed, although use as a civilian airport for fixed-wing operations was considered untenable due to the proximity to and extensive commercial air traffic associated with, John F. Kennedy International Airport. In 1972, it was ultimately decided to integrate the airport into the Gateway National Recreation Area. Floyd Bennett Field reopened as a park in 1974.

Many of the earliest surviving original structures are included in a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places, being among the largest collections and best representatives of commercial aviation architecture from the period, and due to the significant contributions to general aviation and military aviation made there during the Interwar period. Floyd Bennett Field also contains facilities such as a natural area, a campground, and grasslands.

Floyd Bennett Field was New York City&#x27;s first municipal airport, built largely in response to the growth of commercial aviation after World War I. During the 1920s, air travel in Europe was more popular than in the United States because, although Europe had a surplus of airplanes, the United States already had a national railroad system, which reduced the need for commercial aircraft. While other localities (such as Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Cleveland, Ohio) had municipal airports, New York City had a multitude of private airfields, and thus did not see the need for a municipal airport until the late 1920s.

The New York City Board of Estimate submitted a recommendation for a New York City municipal airport in 1925, but it was denied. Two years later, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a similar recommendation, which was largely ignored. By this time, the city urgently needed an airport. This was underscored by the construction of the Newark Metropolitan Airport in 1928, as well as several transatlantic flights from the New York area that were piloted by such figures as Charles Lindbergh, Clarence D. Chamberlin, and Charles A. Levine. Most of the nation&#x27;s air traffic around this time was from airmail operations, and the United States Postal Service designated Newark Airport as the airmail terminal for the New York City area, since Newark was the region&#x27;s best-equipped airport for airmail traffic. New York City officials decided that an airport in the city itself was necessary, because placing the airmail terminal in Newark represented a missed opportunity to put New York City on the aviation map.

In mid-1927, Herbert Hoover, the United States Secretary of Commerce, approved the creation of a &quot;Fact-Finding Committee on Suitable Airport Facilities for the New York Metropolitan District&quot;. The Hoover committee, composed of representatives from New York and New Jersey, identified six general locations in the metropolitan area where an airport could be built. The committee recommended Middle Village, in Central Queens, as the first location for an airfield. Its second choice was an existing airstrip on Barren Island in southeastern Brooklyn. Another site in the eastern part of the bay, near the present-day JFK Airport, was also recommended. At the time, the report listed three &quot;Federal or State Fields&quot;, three &quot;Commercial Fields&quot;, and seventeen &quot;Intermediate Fields&quot; in the New York metropolitan area. Chamberlin was appointed as the city&#x27;s aeronautical engineer to make the final decision on the airport&#x27;s location.

There was much debate over where the airport should be located. U.S. Representative and future New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia, himself a former military airman, advocated for a commercial airport to be placed in Governors Island, as it was closer to Manhattan and located in the middle of New York Harbor. He left open the possibility that the outer boroughs could also build their own local airports. La Guardia, along with Representative William W. Cohen, introduced a motion in the 70th United States Congress to establish the airport on Governors Island, but it was voted down.

====Site chosen====
Chamberlin chose Barren Island as the site for the new municipal airport. An isolated settlement on the island had been developed in the late 19th century, and at its peak, had been home to &quot;several thousand&quot; people. A garbage incinerator and a glue factory had been located on the island. By the 1920s, Barren Island&#x27;s industrial presence had dwindled, and only a small percentage of residents remained on the island. In 1927, a pilot named Paul Rizzo had opened the Barren Island Airport, a private airstrip, on the island.

Chamberlin chose the Barren Island location over Middle Village for several reasons. First, city officials had already spent $100 million between 1900 and 1927 toward constructing a seaport in Jamaica Bay, having dredged land for the proposed shipping channels. Chamberlin also favored the Barren Island location because of the lack of obstructions nearby, as well as the presence of Jamaica Bay, which would allow seaplanes to also use the airport. Finally, the site was city-owned, while the land in Middle Village was not. City officials believed that an airport at Barren Island would be able to spur development of Jamaica Bay, despite the abandonment of the seaport proposal. However, airline companies feared that the Barren Island Airport would have low visibility during foggy days, a claim Chamberlin disputed because he said there was little history of fog in the area.

===Construction===
In February 1928, the Board of Estimate unanimously approved Chamberlin&#x27;s suggestion to build the airport at Barren Island, allotting a plot on Barren Island for that purpose. The project also received an appropriation of $500,000, paid for with taxes. One of the members of Hoover&#x27;s Fact-Finding Committee objected because Middle Village was located at a higher elevation with less fog, while Barren Island was more frequently foggy during the spring and fall. However, Barren Island was already flat, so an airport located there would be ready for use in less time than an airport built on the hills of Middle Village. After the plan was approved, two airmail companies announced that they would not move their operations from New Jersey to Barren Island, because the airmail facilities at Newark International Airport were closer to Manhattan than the proposed Barren Island Airport was.

Designs for the proposed Barren Island Airport were being solicited in 1927, even before the city had given its approval of the Barren Island site. By January 1928, the New York City Department of Docks had composed its own team to create plans for the airport. The future airport would be able to accommodate both airplanes and seaplanes. A &quot;Jamaica Bay Channel&quot; on the airport&#x27;s east side would provide loading docks and hangars for seaplanes. The airplane hangars and an administrative building would occupy the northwest corner of the airport. Four runways would be built across the rest of the grass field. By fall 1928, the Department of Docks had published a more detailed plan that would theoretically allow the Barren Island Airport to get an &quot;A1A&quot; rating, the highest rating for an airport awarded by the United States Department of Commerce. This new plan called for two perpendicular concrete runways in a &quot;T&quot; shape, with one being long and the other being long. An administration building, fourteen hangars, and other maintenance facilities would be constructed on the west side of the airport, parallel to Flatbush Avenue. The rest of the airport would be a grass field.

The Department of Docks was in charge of constructing the Barren Island Airport. The first contract for construction was awarded in May 1928. The $583,000 contract entailed filling in or leveling of soil across a parcel. Sand from Jamaica Bay was used to connect the islands and raise the site to above the high–tide mark. This contract was completed by May 1929. A subsequent contract for $75,000 involved filling in an extra of land, and was finished by the end of 1929. In order to secure an &quot;A1A&quot; rating, the planners built runways, twice the minimum runway width mandated by the Department of Commerce. These runways were designed for planes taking off. The planners also constructed grass fields with several layers of soil, which would allow for smooth plane landings. They conducted studies on other infrastructure, such as the power, sewage, and water systems, to determine what materials should be used to allow the airport to get an &quot;AAA&quot; rating, which was the same as an &quot;A1A&quot; rating.

Barren Island Airport was renamed after the aviator Floyd Bennett in October 1928. Floyd&#x27;s wife, Cora, recalled that they had once toured Barren Island when Floyd said, &quot;Some day, Cora, there will be an airport here.&quot; Bennett and Richard E. Byrd claimed to have been the first to travel to the North Pole by airplane, having made the flight in May 1926, for which they both received the Medal of Honor. They were preparing to fly to the South Pole in 1927 when Bennett placed these plans on hold in order to rescue the crew of the &quot;Bremen&quot;. Bennett died of pneumonia in April 1928, during the &quot;Bremen&quot; rescue mission, and he was subsequently buried with honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Many things were named after Bennett, including the aircraft Byrd and three others flew to the South Pole in 1929 and the Barren Island Airport.

After the field was completely filled and leveled, the two concrete runways were built. The shorter runway was numbered 15–33 while the longer runway was numbered 6–24. At the time, Runway 6–24 was the longest concrete runway in the U.S. The layer of reinforced concrete, gravel drainage strips, and extra width contributed to the airport&#x27;s &quot;AAA&quot; rating. The new airfield&#x27;s runways, built at a time when most &quot;airports&quot; still had dirt runways and no night landings, made the airport among the most advanced of its day, as did its comfortable terminal facilities with numerous amenities.

As work on the runways was ongoing, plans for the administration building and hangars were being revised. The number of hangars was reduced from fourteen to eight due to a lack of funds; the other six hangars were supposed to be built later, but it never happened. After the plans were finalized in late 1929, construction started on the administration building and eight hangars. Materials were shipped by boat to a temporary pier west of Flatbush Avenue. In 1930, work started on the administration building. The administration building was erected on the west side of the field, near Flatbush Avenue, and four hangars each were constructed to the north and south of the building. The architect of the hangars and administration building is not documented, but Tony P. Wrenn, a preservation consultant, surmises that Edward C. Remson designed these structures. In 1929, builders awarded contracts for hydraulic filling operations, a wooden perimeter fence, soil placement and seeding, and runway widening. These contracts were substantially complete by 1930.

===Opening===
The airport dedication occurred on June 26, 1930. A crowd of 25,000 attended this aerial demonstration led by Charles Lindbergh and Jimmy Doolittle. A flotilla of 600 U.S. Army Air Corps aircraft circled the field as part of the airport dedication. Admiral Byrd, Mayor Walker and his wife, and Cora Bennett were present at the event. However, the airport was not finished at that time. The administration building and parking areas had yet to be completed. The costs of the proposed airport were increasing even as its completion was being delayed. A few days after the dedication, &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that the airport would not be complete until 1932 and would cost $4.5 million.

Floyd Bennett Field was formally dedicated again on May 23, 1931, upon its official completion. At the time, the Administration Building was almost finished, and the United States Navy was to occupy part of the airfield. The dedication was attended by 25,000 people, including Chamberlain; Byrd; Captain John H. Towers, who flew the first transatlantic flight; F. Trubee Davison, the assistant United States Secretary of the Army for Aviation; and Colonel Charles Lindbergh, who flew the first solo transatlantic flight. Many of the attendees were also there to view the largest aircraft demonstration to date in the United States&#x27; history: that day, 597 aircraft flew over the metropolitan area. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that if the aircraft demonstration had not been visible around the city, Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s dedication might have attracted more spectators.

===Commercial use===

From May 23, 1931, through the end of the year, the airport recorded 1,153 commercial aircraft and 605 military craft, which made a combined 25,000 landings. According to the 1932 Annual Report from the Department of Docks, Floyd Bennett Field had become &quot;the most desirable American Field as an ocean hop terminal&quot;: at least four transatlantic flights had occurred there that year, and at least four more flights had been scheduled for 1933. By 1933, Floyd Bennett Field accommodated more flights than Newark Airport: there were 51,828 arrivals and departures at Floyd Bennett Field in 1933, compared to 19,232 at Newark the same year. By number of flights, Floyd Bennett Field was the second-busiest airport in the U.S. that year, behind only Oakland International Airport in California.

Floyd Bennett Field was never a commercial success due to its distance from the rest of New York City. Through 1934, there were no commercial passenger airlines that made regular scheduled arrivals or departures at Floyd Bennett Field. This was partly because Floyd Bennett Field was never able to secure a lucrative stream of airmail traffic, which went to Newark Airport instead. According to the 1933 annual report, Newark Airport carried 120,000 airline passengers, of mail, and of express mail, as opposed to Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s 52 airline passengers, 98 bags of mail, and of express. According to Tony Wrenn, most of the passenger aircraft and mail planes that landed at Floyd Bennett Field likely only did so because the planes could not land at Newark Airport. In 1937, American Airlines became the only commercial airline that regularly operated at Floyd Bennett Field, and for one specific flight: an air shuttle from New York to Boston. Seaplane taxi routes running from Floyd Bennett Field to piers on the East River at Wall Street and 31st Street were established, but they failed to attract airlines.

As a general aviation airfield, Floyd Bennett Field attracted the record-breaking pilots of the interwar period because of its superior modern facilities, lack of nearby obstacles, and convenient location near the Atlantic Ocean (see ). The airport hosted dozens of &quot;firsts&quot; and time records as well as a number of air races in its heyday, such as the Bendix Cup. Civilians were also allowed to take flying lessons at Floyd Bennett Field.

Various improvements were made to the airport throughout its entire commercial existence: first as a seaplane hangar, then by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and finally by the United States Navy. However, Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s lack of commercial tenants, a byproduct of its isolation from the rest of the city, caused the city to begin developing LaGuardia Field in northern Queens. The new airfield was much closer to Manhattan. Commercial aviation activity at Floyd Bennett Field ceased in 1939, when LaGuardia Field (now Airport) was opened. The Navy gained ownership of the field in 1941 after leasing space there for several years.

====Accessibility====

Flatbush Avenue was widened and straightened to create a more direct route into Manhattan. In 1937, the avenue was extended south to the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, which in turn connected to the Rockaways. However, this had more to do with the expansion of Marine Park and Jacob Riis Park. The same year, a bus route to the subway, the current Q35 route to the Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station, was established in order to create a faster connection to Manhattan. However, the Q35 bus only started making stops at Floyd Bennett Field in 1940.

Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s poor location in outer Brooklyn inhibited its usefulness. There were no limited-access roads between Manhattan and the airport, and the only direct route from Manhattan to Floyd Bennett Field was Flatbush Avenue, a congested street with local traffic throughout its length. This was exacerbated by the fact that the bus-to-subway connection did not occur until 1940. The Belt Parkway, which was constructed between 1934 and 1940, provided a limited-access connection to Manhattan for cars. However, commercial traffic could still only use Flatbush Avenue since commercial vehicles were banned from parkways in New York.
====Airmail terminal proposals====
During the 1930s, commercial air traffic at airports nationwide was low because few people could afford plane tickets, and airmail made up the majority of air traffic in the United States. Officials believed that &quot;all aviation activity in the New York area&quot; should be located at Floyd Bennett Field. LaGuardia pushed for Floyd Bennett Field to replace Newark Airport in Newark, New Jersey as the city&#x27;s de facto main air terminal, including designs and plans to shuttle passengers to and from Manhattan in flying boats. However, Newark Airport turned out to be adequately equipped to handle commercial traffic. In the early days of commercial aviation, the bulk of profits was provided by freight instead of passengers. As airmail was a major fraction of air freight at the time, airports having contracts with the United States Post Office Department attracted commercial airlines, and the Post Office Department had already designated Newark Airport as New York City&#x27;s airmail terminal. In order to try and compete, an expansion of the city&#x27;s pneumatic tube mail system was planned between Floyd Bennett Field and the main post office in Brooklyn, with a branch of the system continuing to lower Manhattan.

In one well-publicized incident in November 1933, shortly before La Guardia assumed the New York City mayor&#x27;s office, he refused to get off a plane at Newark Airport because his ticket said that the flight went to New York, and the mayor-elect demanded that the plane be flown to Floyd Bennett Field. In 1934, officials requested that the Post Office Department compare the merits of Newark Airport and Floyd Bennett Field, as they believed that the latter was better equipped. In letters to Postmaster General James Farley, U.S. Representatives from Brooklyn extolled the new facilities at Floyd Bennett Field and compared them to the inadequate facilities at Newark Airport. However, the representatives failed to note that the Postal Service had chosen Newark Airport because it was built first.

In 1935, La Guardia succeeded in convincing the Post Office Department to review the benefits and drawbacks of Floyd Bennett Field. The department&#x27;s review of the airport consisted mainly of drawbacks: there was no direct highway or train route from Floyd Bennett Field to Manhattan, but there were such links between Newark and Manhattan. La Guardia suggested that the New York City Subway be extended to Floyd Bennett Field in order to resolve this problem. In August 1935 the department decided to keep the metropolitan area&#x27;s airline terminal at Newark. However, La Guardia persisted in lobbying for Floyd Bennett Field. He had the New York City Police Department calculate how long it would take, in clear weather, to go from Penn Station to each airport and then back to Penn Station. The NYPD found that it only took 24 minutes to get to or from Newark, but that the same trip to Floyd Bennett Field took 38 minutes. &quot;The New York Times&quot; determined that it would take five to ten minutes more to go from Midtown Manhattan to Floyd Bennett Field than to Newark. After learning of this evidence, La Guardia then petitioned to make Floyd Bennett Field a suitable alternative to the Newark airmail terminal. To support his argument, La Guardia cited several flights that had been diverted to Floyd Bennett Field.

In December 1935, a meeting was held at the Post Office Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., concerning Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s suitability as an airmail terminal. Grover Whalen, chairman of La Guardia&#x27;s Committee on Airport Development, argued that the city had an &quot;inalienable right&quot; to appear on maps of the United States&#x27; airspace, and that Floyd Bennett Field was ready for use as an alternate airmail terminal. In March 1936, Farley announced that he had rejected the bid to move airmail operations to Floyd Bennett Field because all evidence showed that doing so would cause a decline in traffic and profits.

Ultimately, La Guardia was never able to convince the Postal Service to move its New York City operations from Newark to Floyd Bennett Field. Because airmail traffic did not move to Floyd Bennett Field, neither did most of the commercial lines, save for American Airlines flights to Boston. Instead, he decided to allow the city to construct LaGuardia Airport in Queens. The new airport was much closer to Manhattan, and it took advantage of the then-new Queens-Midtown Tunnel. Moreover, the federal government created a new airmail contract in which it divided airmail traffic between Newark Airport and LaGuardia Airport once the latter was completed. This confirmed that Floyd Bennett Field was denied an airmail contract not in spite of being located in New York City, but because it was too far from Manhattan.

====Military and police activity====

After the 1930 closure of Naval Air Station Rockaway across Rockaway Inlet, a hangar at Floyd Bennett Field was dedicated as Naval Air Reserve Base New York within the larger civilian facility. The Naval Reserve Aviation Unit started using Floyd Bennett Field in April 1931, when it moved from Long Island&#x27;s Curtiss Field to Hangar 1 in Floyd Bennett Field, leasing the hangar for $1 per year. The Department of Docks allowed the Navy to use the airport&#x27;s other facilities as needed, but left the Navy to pay for any additional expenses on its own. The unit soon moved to Hangar 5 because they required more space.

Starting in 1934, the NYPD also occupied a hangar for the world&#x27;s first police aviation unit. The NYPD Aviation Unit occupied Hangar 4.

In 1935, the United States Coast Guard wrote a letter to the city requesting that part of Floyd Bennett Field be set aside for Coast Guard use. In 1936, a square parcel of Floyd Bennett Field along Jamaica Bay, covering an approximately area, was leased to the Coast Guard for the creation of Coast Guard Air Station Brooklyn (CGAS Brooklyn). In February 1937, the Graves-Quinn Corporation was hired to create a hangar, barracks building, garages, and &quot;other support facilities&quot; for the new Coast Guard station. The $1 million facility opened in June 1938. At the time, the Coast Guard was only paying $1 per year in rent, which was insufficient in light of Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s commercial troubles.

The Navy expanded in 1937 and again in 1939 (see ). The Navy wished to further expand its presence in Floyd Bennett Field, and in June 1940, the government started a third, $1 million expansion of the naval facilities there. It built barracks for 125 Naval Reserve cadets, expanded Hangar 2, and took over Hangars 3 and 4. The Navy agreed to rent the expanded complex for $8,000 per year, effective October 1. However, by August 1940, the Navy was considering purchasing the entire airport. The city valued Floyd Bennett Field at $15 million, but was at first uncertain about whether to sell the airport. The city wanted to retain control of the airport because the NYPD base was housed there. La Guardia also felt that the federal government might buy the airport for less than the assessed price of $15 million because it had already paid for improvements.

Throughout this time, World War II&#x27;s European theater was growing in intensity. In December 1940, while the Navy and the city were in negotiations about the proposed sale of Floyd Bennett Field, the Navy pilot Eddie August Schneider died in a training crash on the tarmac, together with another pilot whom he was training.

A security survey, conducted in spring 1941, weighed the benefits and drawbacks of Floyd Bennett Field. The benefit was that the Navy already had a base there, but the drawback was that it was going to be too hard to manage both military and civilian traffic at the same airport. The solution was to close the airport to all civilian uses (see ). Soon after the survey was conducted, the city suggested that the Navy take an 8-year lease on the airport, while the Coast Guard continued to lease its own hangar.

====Improvements====
Improvements to Floyd Bennett Field continued even after its second dedication. A study from the State University of New York lists four phases of construction through 1941, including three phases after the airport&#x27;s opening. The first additional phase, between 1932 and 1933, covers the completion of the seaplane facilities at Floyd Bennett Field. A second phase from 1934 to 1938 covers improvements WPA, while a third phase includes additions by the United States Navy between 1939 and 1941.

A vehicle parking area was completed in May 1931, and the Administration Building was opened in October of the same year. New taxiways and a temporary wire fence were completed in 1932. That year, contracts for repairing the hangars&#x27; roofs and grading the land were also awarded. Floyd Bennett Field did not yet have an A1A rating, so the city gave a contract to the General Electric Company to install lights along the runways; lighted directional signs on the roofs of three hangars; and wind-recording equipment. A local company, the Sperry Gyroscope Company, was contracted to install two floodlight towers around the field. An electrical wiring system was built around the airport, and two accompanying buildings hosting a transformer and sewage pump were built alongside it. The other maintenance facilities were not added until later. A gravel parking area with two entrance driveways, as well as a separator fence between the parking area and the runways, was completed in 1932. Three taxiways, each wide, were constructed in order to reduce congestion from planes who were lining up to take off.

A seaplane base was also constructed as part of the first additional phase of construction. It had been part of the original plans for the airport, but only a steel bulkhead had been constructed. During the initial construction phase, seaplane ramps had been built on the east side of the airport. The contract for a seaplane base with four hangars was awarded in 1930 and completed in October 1931. The city had finished building a by seaplane ramp by August 1931. It was accompanied by a by seaplane pier and three anchorage buoys. Three seaplane runways were built, as well as a turning basin.

Spurred by the expansion of air travel across the United States, the Department of Docks began planning extensive upgrades to Floyd Bennett Field in 1934. The plans coincided with the authorization of the WPA, which provided the labor needed to carry out these upgrades. In 1935, the WPA allocated $1.5 million to finish the airport. The federal government ultimately contributed $4.7 million toward Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s expansion, while the city spent only slightly more than $339,000. The WPA constructed two extra runways; expanded hangars and airport aprons; erected extra maintenance buildings; added a passenger tunnel under the administration building; and placed utility wires and pipes underground. The WPA also planted a landscaped lawn in front of the administration building. The work involved the demolition of a brick chimney at the south end of Barren Island, which lay in the way of one of the new runways.

There were plans to add four more hangars and two more ramps to the existing seaplane base, but they were not acted upon due to low passenger traffic volumes. The expanded seaplane base was also in the path of Runway 12–30, which was added as part of the WPA renovations. Because the base was not going to be expanded, the Coast Guard started using the unfinished seaplane base for their own purposes. The Coast Guard added a new hangar, a taxiway, and three radio towers.

The Navy, which already occupied part of Floyd Bennett Field, unveiled plans to expand its facilities there in 1938. The next year, the timeline was moved up due to World War II in Europe. In 1939, the Navy started constructing a base for 24 seaplanes at Floyd Bennett Field, in preparation for expanding its &quot;neutrality patrol&quot; activities during World War II. After its 1939 expansion, the Navy occupied Hangars 1 and 2; the new Building A in between Hangars 1 and 2; and half of the field&#x27;s &quot;Dope Shop&quot;. In January 1940, Congress approved the Navy&#x27;s request to take over ownership of in Floyd Bennett Field so it could construct a new base. Like the Coast Guard, the Navy would lease the land for $1 per year, but if the Navy stopped using their facilities at Floyd Bennett Field, the Navy base&#x27;s ownership would revert to the New York City government.

===Naval Air Station New York===
====Acquisition====
Changes to the Navy&#x27;s expansion plan were announced on May 25, 1941. As part of the plan, all private airlines were ordered to leave, and all remaining residents on Barren Island would be evicted to make way for a larger facility. On May 26, 1941, the airport was closed to all commercial and general aviation uses. A week later, on June 2, the Navy opened Naval Air Station New York (NAS New York) with an air show that attracted 30,000 to 50,000 attendees. The audience included Navy undersecretary James Forrestal; Admiral Harold R. Stark; Rear Admiral Clark H. Woodward, commandant of the Brooklyn Navy Yard; Rear Admiral Chester W. Nimitz; Rear Admiral John H. Towers; New York City mayor La Guardia, and Brooklyn borough president John Cashmore.

By fall 1941, the Navy decided that Floyd Bennett Field was the best place to put its air station in New York. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Navy sought to acquire the property, as well as surrounding land, as soon as possible. Artemus Gates, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air, wrote a letter to La Guardia stating that the Navy was willing to take over control of Floyd Bennett Field for a price of $9.75 million. This offer was substantially less than La Guardia&#x27;s asking price of $15 million, and it took into account the valuation of the WPA improvements and existing military facilities. On February 9, 1942, the Navy submitted a &quot;declaration of taking&quot; that would allow it to acquire most of the desired land for $9.25 million. Nine days later, on February 18, the rest of Floyd Bennett Field became part of NAS New York. Most prior leases were terminated, but the Coast Guard was allowed to stay if its operations did not conflict with the Navy&#x27;s. This meant that the NYPD aviation unit at Floyd Bennett Field was forced to relocate for the duration of the war.

The expanded naval base totaled over . This consisted of of the existing airfield; the combined that belonged to the Coast Guard and Navy; and the combined that belonged to the remaining Barren Island residents. The Navy had also wanted to buy on the west side of Flatbush Avenue, which was reserved for a future expansion of Marine Park. However, New York City Parks Department Commissioner Robert Moses prevented the purchase from happening. Some of the money from the transaction was to go toward improving Marine Park.

====World War II====

The Navy awarded the first contract for upgrades to Floyd Bennett Field on December 17, 1941. The Navy&#x27;s Design Division developed most of the expansion plans instead of contracting them out. It graded the undeveloped land to 16 feet to make it level with the rest of the airport. Demolition of the future barracks site on the western side of the field started in spring 1941. Because newer craft necessitated longer runways, a new Runway 6–24 was built on the northern side of the field, and three existing runways were expanded so that all four runways measured long by wide. The Navy built a seaplane hangar and two seaplane runways, as well as extended the taxiways and roads. It also constructed facilities for officers on Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s eastern side, such as barracks, training rooms, dining rooms, and auditoriums. The Navy also filled in the northeastern section of the former Barren Island. A new entrance for the Navy was created at the south end of Floyd Bennett Field, and a one-story annex on the north side of the Administration Building was added. A dirigible landing station and two front-line simulator facilities were installed within the field. Significant effort was spent toward developing the part of the base that faced Jamaica Bay, where a recreation area was installed. All remnants of Barren Island&#x27;s former community and landscape were obliterated.

The upgrades allowed 6,500 people to use the naval base. Most of the new structures were designed to be removable because of the possibility that Floyd Bennett Field might become a civilian airfield again after the war. In accordance with military conventions, all the buildings at Floyd Bennett Field were given numbers.

During the war, NAS New York hosted several naval aviation units of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, including three land-based antisubmarine patrol squadrons, a scout observation service unit, and two Naval Air Transport Service (NATS) squadrons (processing the majority of the aircraft destined for the Pacific Theater). NAS New York served as a training facility, as well as a base where Navy boats could load supplies and officers. NAS New York aircraft also patrolled the Atlantic coastline and engaged German U-boats. In addition, Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) took up several positions, including those of air traffic controllers, parachute riggers, and aviation machinist&#x27;s mates. The Military Air Transport Service opened an East Coast terminal at Floyd Bennett Field in December 1943. More than 20,000 new aircraft were delivered to NAS New York during the war, and more than 46,000 aircraft movements were recorded from December 1943 to November 1945.

CGAS Brooklyn worked in conjunction with NAS New York, patrolling New York Harbor as well as testing equipment, training soldiers, and delivering supplies. Starting in 1944, CGAS Brooklyn tested Navy craft and trained the pilots.

====Korean to Vietnam Wars====
In 1946, after the conclusion of World War II, many naval stations were decommissioned or downgraded. As part of these cutbacks, Floyd Bennett Field became a Naval Air Reserve station. At the time, it was the largest Naval Air Reserve base in the U.S. The Navy demolished many of the temporary structures, including the barracks, as well as the outdated Sperry floodlights. The Navy renovated the recreation field on the southern side of Floyd Bennett Field. The NYPD Aviation Unit resumed its operations at the Naval Air Reserve base.

By 1947, there were proposals to use Floyd Bennett Field for commercial purposes again. The airport would have handled the excess traffic from LaGuardia Airport while LaGuardia was being repaired and Idlewild (now JFK) Airport was being built. In April 1947, the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made a preliminary agreement that allowed the Port Authority to take over operations of all airports in New York City by June. The Port Authority hoped to spend $1.5 million to improve facilities for airlines with foreign registrations. However, the partial conversion of Floyd Bennett Field commercial use was delayed over concerns of cost: the Navy estimated that it would cost $1.2 million to move its facilities, but the Port Authority would not spend more than $750,000 for the Navy to do this. The Navy mostly operated on the southern and eastern parts of the airport during this time. By September 1947, the Port Authority and the Navy were deadlocked, unable to reach an agreement. Commercial traffic at Floyd Bennett Field ultimately never materialized, as the airspace congestion near LaGuardia Airport was resolved.

The Navy allowed New York Air National Guard and the U.S. Army Air Reserve to use the hangars on the condition that their activities did not interfere with the Navy&#x27;s. The Coast Guard regained control of CGAS Brooklyn, and it also began leasing nearly of the Navy base adjoining CGAS Brooklyn&#x27;s southern border. By 1950, Cold War and Korean War preparations were underway, and the Navy needed to use Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s facilities again. However, Floyd Bennett Field was less busy during the Korean War than during World War II. Five reserve squadrons based at Floyd Bennett Field were recalled to active duty for the Korean War. Some minor modifications were made during this time. The Navy lengthened three runways, reconstructed roads and taxiways, built a beacon tower and veterans&#x27; housing, and added some fuel storage containers. A new southern entrance was built because one of the runway extensions overlapped with the old entrance. The Navy abandoned many of the original buildings on the western side of the field, instead moving to the eastern side. The Coast Guard made even fewer modifications: it expanded its apron, built a small hangar, and replaced its wooden seaplane ramp with a concrete one.

Throughout the remainder of the postwar period and until the early 1970s, NAS New York-Floyd Bennett Field primarily functioned as a support base for units of the Naval Air Reserve and the Marine Air Reserve. The airport was also a training facility for reserve squadrons. Until 1970, more than 3,000 reservists in the Navy and Marines trained at Floyd Bennett Field every weekend, and 34 aircraft squadrons were constantly being maintained at the field. The field was busiest during the weekends when there were up to 300 daily departures from Floyd Bennett Field. The installation also served as a base for units of the New York Air National Guard from 1947 to 1970, when the Air National Guard moved to the Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base on Long Island. Minor adjustments were made to the field through the 1960s in order to accommodate jet aircraft. The Navy also built a trailer park and a school building in the main barracks area during this time.

====Decommissioning====
During the height of the Vietnam War in the late 1960s, military budgets were strained by a combination of combat operations in Southeast Asia and funding constraints due to President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s concurrent Great Society programs. This necessitated all the services, but especially the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, to reduce stateside installation infrastructure. By 1970, the Navy was offloading property, including NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field, to pay for the war&#x27;s expenses.

On March 5, 1970, the federal government announced that the Navy would start vacating the military portion of the airport and close the operational airfield. Upon the announcement of NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s decommissioning, Mayor John V. Lindsay asked the federal government for permission to convert the field into a commercial airport. Simultaneously, Governor Nelson Rockefeller proposed a $1.4 billion development on the site. If built, Rockefeller&#x27;s development would contain a shopping mall, an industrial park, 46,100 housing units, and the potential for 180,000 residents. The governor&#x27;s proposal had been in planning since November 1969.

On April 4, 1970, the Navy conducted its last daily formal inspections, an act that started the process of decommissioning NAS New York / Floyd Bennett Field. NAS New York&#x27;s tenant squadrons and units and personnel were transferred to other naval air stations. A Naval Air Reserve Detachment, which supported non-flying units, remained as Naval Air Reserve New York / Naval Reserve Center New York. The Navy itself continued to own the land for two more years. The Naval Air Reserve Detachment would occupy Hangar A until 1983.

Meanwhile, the dispute over the possible future uses of Floyd Bennett Field continued. In May 1970, the state government released more details of its redevelopment proposal without consulting the city. The next month, Lindsay&#x27;s administration wrote to the federal government, advocating for Floyd Bennett Field to be converted to commercial use. U.S. President Richard Nixon supported a third proposal: turning the entirety of Floyd Bennett Field into a national park. This had been suggested by the Regional Plan Association (RPA) the previous year, except that the RPA had advocated for a national seashore. In May, the president started the process of getting Congressional approval for this move. The state government objected, since the neighboring Marine Park was not used. In the meantime, Floyd Bennett Field was only sparsely used by Coast Guard and NYPD helicopters.

===National Park Service stewardship===
====Creation and early years====

The United States House of Representatives approved the creation of Gateway National Recreation Area in September 1972, and most of the land was transferred to the National Park Service (NPS) for inclusion in Gateway National Recreation Area. In the same vote, the House denied the state&#x27;s provision to create a housing development at Floyd Bennett Field. The recreation area was officially created on October 27, 1972. The National Park Service acquired most of the Navy-owned portion of the field, as well as some city-owned land to the west and north that had not been owned by the Navy. Floyd Bennett Field became the headquarters for the Gateway Area&#x27;s Jamaica Bay unit. The Coast Guard was able to gain ownership of CGAS Brooklyn, which it then proceeded to expand. In circa 1973, new concrete barracks were erected on the site of the former World War II-era barracks. The remainder of Floyd Bennett Field was owned separately by the Naval Air Reserve Detachment, as well as the United States Department of the Interior (the NPS&#x27; parent agency) and the United States Department of Transportation (the Coast Guard&#x27;s parent agency). The NYPD&#x27;s aviation unit continued to lease space in hangar 3, and later also started leasing hangar 4.

The park opened in 1974. Most of the National Park Service&#x27;s early actions regarding Floyd Bennett Field focused on promoting recreational activities. Due to a lack of funds, the NPS let much of the physical field revert to its natural state. The NPS added tents in two areas of Floyd Bennett Field, which it then designated as campgrounds. Around 1974, the NPS also planted pine trees near the field&#x27;s southern boundary, forming the current &quot;Ecology Village&quot;. By 1979, the NPS had developed a &quot;General Management Plan&quot; for the entire Gateway Area. The plan allowed for Floyd Bennett Field to be divided into three management zones: the &quot;Natural Area&quot;, the &quot;Developed Area&quot;, and the &quot;Administrative Area&quot;. It also created the new William Fitts Ryan Visitor Center within the former administration building. In 1980, many of the airport&#x27;s structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In its early years as a park, Floyd Bennett Field had very few visitors. According to a 1991 estimate, about 30 people visited the park on an average day. The field&#x27;s chief park ranger at the time attributed the low visitor count to several factors, including &quot;the chain-link fence along Flatbush Avenue, the Coast Guard station and the guardhouse&quot;. The park was relatively unknown even to people who lived nearby.

====1990s====
In 1988, the NPS started seeking plans for private developments at Floyd Bennett Field. Many of these plans, including those for condominium housing and an amusement park, were dismissed. By the 1990s, the NPS began looking for commercial tenants to occupy the deteriorating hangars. In approximately 1996, Floyd Bennett Field received an allocation of funds, which it used to improve parking access in front of the Ryan Center.

In 1997, the 6th Communication Battalion of the United States Marine Corps Reserve moved onto the south side of Floyd Bennett Field. The next year, CGAS Brooklyn was decommissioned following its merger with CGAS Cape May, New Jersey, and relocation to the new Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, New Jersey. The majority of former Coast Guard land then transferred to the National Park Service. A small portion remained in the possession of the Coast Guard&#x27;s parent agency at the time, U.S. Department of Transportation, so the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) could use it. The NYPD moved their aviation operation from a hangar to the former Coast Guard Air Station facilities shortly afterward, under agreement with the NPS. The New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) also moved into Floyd Bennett Field by the late 1990s, using the runways as a location for truck-driving practice.

In 1999, a Doppler radar tower for recording wind shears was placed at Floyd Bennett Field for use by nearby JFK Airport. The $6 million tower was controversial, as residents protested that the tower was visually unattractive. In September 1999, the Department of the Interior granted the FAA permission to erect the radar at Floyd Bennett Field on the condition that the radar be torn down in 20 years. If a less disruptive radar was developed before then, the tower at Floyd Bennett Field had to be torn down. The Interior Department disliked the radar&#x27;s placement within Floyd Bennett Field, but allowed the FAA to build the radar within the NYPD heliport, which had &quot;no recreational value&quot;. At the time, JFK Airport was the last major airport in the United States to receive a wind shear radar. Attempts at building the radar dated to 1993, but were delayed because Long Island residents and U.S. Senator Al D&#x27;Amato opposed it.

====21st century====
The NPS issued a request for proposals for the hangars in 2001 and received two bids, both of which contained an ice skating rink. A company named Aviator submitted the winning bid. In 2006, hangars 1 through 4 were adapted for reuse and leased as a business concession to the Aviator Sports and Events Center, a community-based sports and entertainment complex. The site of hangars 9 and 10 was also redeveloped as part of the Aviator Complex. Since the opening of the Aviator Sports Complex, there have been other plans to renovate Floyd Bennett Field. These range from grandiose plans, such as an Olympic-size swimming pool or drive-in theater, to regular upkeep, such as clearer signs and transportation across the airport. By the early 2000s, Ryan Center was being rehabilitated to its original state. In 2010, work started on the restoration of the building. The renovation was completed in May 2012.

During the 21st century, Floyd Bennett Field has been used for dealing with the aftermath of disasters. After the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 into Belle Harbor in the nearby Rockaway Peninsula on November 12, 2001, one of Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s hangars was used as a makeshift morgue for the crash victims. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in October and November 2012, a portion of one runway was used as a staging area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for relief workers who were conducting rescues and evacuations in the Rockaways.

In July 2011, U.S. Representative Michael G. Grimm introduced H.R. 2606 – New York City Natural Gas Supply Enhancement Act, which would convert one of Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s hangars to a gas meter station for a proposed natural gas pipeline through New York City. The Williams Company was to restore that hangar for pipeline use. In 2015, U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand announced that a bill with a $2.4 million upgrade for the New York State Marine Corps Reserve complex in Brooklyn had passed in the U.S. Congress. The next year, Gillibrand obtained $15.1 million in funding to renovate two Marine Corps Reserve facilities, including the 6th Communications Battalion, which needed $1.9 million to replace electrical duct banks.

Nonprofit organization Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy presented plans to the Brooklyn Community Board 18 in April 2023 for the restoration of three structures at Floyd Bennett Field. The same year, a charter school in Brooklyn announced plans to construct a sustainability-themed school at Floyd Bennett Field for $60 million. In August 2023, state and federal officials reached an agreement to build a large shelter for migrants at Floyd Bennett Field, amid a citywide migrant housing crisis caused by a sharp increase in the number of asylum seekers traveling to the city. The shelter opened that November, but its remote location deterred many migrants. City officials announced plans in December 2024 to close the shelter.

==Description==

Floyd Bennett Field is located on a plot of more than in southeastern Brooklyn, on the western end of Long Island. It is about from Midtown Manhattan.
The field itself is located on the eastern side of Flatbush Avenue along the northern coast of Rockaway Inlet. However, the National Park Service administers land on both sides of the Avenue.

The section east of Flatbush Avenue, comprising the original airport, consists of the airfield&#x27;s eight hangars, an administration building, and five runways. These structures have largely been preserved in their original state, as opposed to most municipal airports, which have been upgraded. Two runways and two taxiways surround a large &quot;field&quot; that is crossed by the three other runways. The North Forty Natural Area is located between the field to the south and the Belt Parkway to the north. The eastern coast is adjoined by Mill Basin Inlet to the north and Jamaica Bay to the east. The Gateway Development Plan of 1979 divides the field in three areas. The &quot;Natural Area&quot;, on the northern side of the field, was intended for ecological preservation. The &quot;Developed Area&quot;, comprising the hangars and administration buildings on the western side of the field, was supposed to be for structural preservation and reuse. Finally, the &quot;Administrative Area&quot; was made up of the structures on the southern side of the field that were still in use by the Coast Guard, the Departments of the Interior and Transportation, and the New York Police Department.

The part of the National Park west of Flatbush Avenue includes a golf driving range and marina. It is bordered by Dead Horse Bay to the west.

Floyd Bennett Field also accommodates public camping, with 46 campsites located on the east side of the field. A &quot;Grassland Management Area&quot; in the center of the field, near the intersection of three of the runways, is closed to the public. An &quot;Ecology Village&quot; for classes of middle-school students is located at the south end of the field. South of the field, there is also an archery range; a softball field for Poly Tech; a baseball field for Poly Tech; and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars. The New York City Police Department (NYPD), New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY), and United States Park Police (USPP) all have their own plots of land on the eastern side of Floyd Bennett Field.

The IATA airport code and Federal Aviation Administration airfield identifier code was NOP when it was an operational naval air station and later Coast Guard air station, but now uses the FAA Location Identifier NY22 for the heliport operated there by the NYPD.

===Administration Building===
The administration building (now the William Fitts Ryan Visitor Center, or Ryan Center) is a two-story neo-Georgian building set back from Flatbush Avenue with a four-story observation tower. Ryan Center, which is named after U.S. Representative William Fitts Ryan, serves as the entrance to Floyd Bennett Field, and formerly also served as the airport&#x27;s passenger terminal and administration building. Ryan Center is partially accessible to the public, including guided visits to the former control tower.

Ryan Center is a rectangular building measuring , with the longer side running parallel to Flatbush Avenue. The facade is made of red and black brick. The building has a brick parapet that juts out above its entablature. It also has quoins, a foundation, and a water table made of white stone. The neoclassical details of the building, which can also be found in train stations and post offices built in the early 20th century, were purposely included to give passengers a familiar feeling. At the time, flying was still largely untested and relatively few people had ever flown.

The western and eastern elevations are composed of three parts, of which the center portions on both facades project outward. On the west side, which faces Flatbush Avenue, the center portion of the facade consists of an entrance with three recessed bays; the two smaller bays on the sides flank a wider and taller central bay. The bays comprise a symmetrical portico with supporting Ionic columns. As built, a polychrome winged globe, part of the original design, was located at the corner of the portico. A Naval Air Station clock hung above each of the three doorways. The west side of the administration building also contained entrance ramps for passengers, which led to baggage ramps on the east side of the building. During the WPA renovations, the baggage ramps were replaced with four tunnels that allowed passengers to cross under the runways.

On the eastern facade, the center portion is shaped like three sides of an octagon. This semi-octagonal-section contains the four-story observation tower; the lower three stories have the same brick facade as the rest of the building, while the former control tower on the top floor contains a steel frame. The control tower was added after the rest of the administration complex had been completed. On the left and right sides of the eastern elevation&#x27;s central portion, there are balconies on the first floor with stone balusters. Bronze letters spelling &quot;Naval Air Station&quot; and &quot;Floyd Bennett Field&quot; are located over the east-side facade&#x27;s entablature. Before the tunnels were added during the WPA renovations, passengers exiting out the eastern side of the building would descend to the airport apron, where they could board planes from ground level. A one-story annex on the northern side of the building was added in 1941.

The interior is designed in the Art Deco style. Originally, the administration building contained a restaurant, cafeteria, post office, dormitories, and visitor&#x27;s lounge. There were also rooms for the National Weather Service and the United States Department of Commerce. It is sparsely ornamented with occasional marble panels.

A parking area was added to the western side of the administration building in 1932. It was a gravel lot that could be accessed by two driveways extending diagonally from Flatbush Avenue. A landscaped garden was added to the front of the administration building from 1935 to 1936. Shrubs and flower beds were placed in front of the Administration Building. A footpath from Flatbush Avenue to the building&#x27;s main entrance, with a circular section in the middle, was built through the front lawn. A flagpole and a park-like entrance sign was placed within the circular part of the sidewalk. Since the front lawn had formerly housed refreshment stands, a one-story refreshment building was erected to the north of the administration building. Two parking facilities were also constructed north of the administration building, near the more northerly set of hangars. During World War II, the driveways and parking lot were fenced off, and all visitors used the field&#x27;s southern entrance on Aviation Road.

A community garden exists south of Ryan Center. With approximately 480 plots, it is the largest community garden in New York City. The Floyd Bennett Garden Association oversees the gardens&#x27; management.

===Hangars===
====Along Hangar Row====
The original hangars, which are numbered, are located on the south side of the airfield near Flatbush Avenue in what is known as &quot;Hangar Row&quot;. Hangars 1–4 were built on the north side of the administration building, while hangars 5–8 were built on the south side. Each set of four hangars is laid out in a 2×2 setup, with both pairs of hangars in each set facing each other. The hangars are of virtually identical design. The structures contain buff-and-brown glazed brick facades with steel frames and steel truss ceilings, and they also originally had aluminum doors. Outside each hangar is a two-story service wing with buff brick facades and steel-framed windows and doors. The letters on the parapets above each hangar spelled &quot;City of New York&quot; and &quot;Floyd Bennett Field&quot;.

Each pair of hangars is connected by a buff brick structure, which housed offices, utilities, and shops. The hangars were constructed in 1929–1931 while the structures between each pair of hangars were constructed during the WPA renovations in 1936–1938. The four pairs of hangars were built in numerically ascending order from north to south: the northernmost hangars are numbered 1 and 2, while the southernmost hangars are numbered 7 and 8. The hangars, their connecting structures, and their service wings contained varying levels of Art Deco decoration on their exteriors. Each of the original eight hangars had a interior space, and their doors were tall. Each of the hangars were created with 80,000 bricks and 250 tons of steel. The hangars were supported by 250 precast deep concrete foundations, each deep with square bases.

By 1942–1943, the Navy had also built hangars 9 and 10, two wood-frame structures, to the north of Hangars 1 and 2. Hangar 9 was the first of the pair to be constructed, followed by Hangar 10 a year later. Both had barrel-vaulted roofs and two-story brick extensions to the east.

In 2006, hangars 5–8 were combined to form the Aviator Sports and Events Center, a $38 million recreational complex. The Aviator Complex contains ice skating rinks within two of the hangars. The other two hangars contain a field house, a gymnastics and dance complex, and a fitness center totaling more than . The Aviator Complex also has several restaurants and stores, as well as two turf football fields outside. The two fields were developed on the sites of hangars 9 and 10.

====Along the coast====

In 1937, the Coast Guard built a hangar on the Jamaica Bay coast, near the southeastern end of Runway 30. The hangar was built in the Moderne architectural style with white stucco-and-concrete walls, glazed sliding doors, a barrel vault-shaped roof, and a bas-relief of Coast Guard insignia above the doors. Its interior measures , and a concrete apron is located outside of the hangar. There is a two-story office wing on the north side of the hangar, as well as one-story attachments to both the west and east. There were also three radio communication towers to the north of the hangar. The Coast Guard occupied the hangar until around 1998.

In 1939, the Navy started construction on the first of two planned hangars along the Jamaica Bay coast. The $600,000 steel-framed Hangar A, which was built to house the Navy&#x27;s flying boats, contains a steel frame and glazed sliding doors to the north and south. Its dimensions are , making it five times as large as hangars 1–8 and three times as large as the Coast Guard Hangar. There are one-story attachments to the west and east. The facade was austere, with no architectural embellishments. A seaplane ramp, wooden pier, and access road were also built along with the new hangar.

In 1942, construction started on the second planned hangar, which was labeled Hangar B. The second hangar was an exact duplicate of Hangar A, and it was located to Hangar A&#x27;s north. In conjunction with this new addition, the Navy also built Seaplane Ramp B. Both hangars were modified to accommodate jet airplanes during the Cold War in the 1950s.

Hangar A was demolished in 1998 when DSNY started occupying part of the former Navy site. Volunteers from the Historic Aircraft Restoration Project maintain a collection of aircraft in Hangar B. These planes are similar to those that were historically used at the airfield.

===Additional buildings===
Originally, all of the maintenance functions were hosted inside the Administration Building, but they later got their own buildings. Many of these buildings were added from 1934 to 1938 as part of the WPA renovation. The maintenance buildings have similar designs to the original eight hangars. A brick service building and a generator building originally faced hangars 1 and 2, while a pump house and generator building were built near hangars 5 and 6. A one-story garage and maintenance shop was built at the airport&#x27;s southwest corner along Flatbush Avenue, south of the hangars. East of the garage, there were two small one-story structures that served as an electrical closet and a pump house. Additionally, a one-story transformer building was located north of the hangars. Two one-story buildings for fire and gasoline pumps are located to the west of Ryan Center.

The Navy also built several wood-frame structures during World War II, south of the hangars. Their facades were made of white clapboards, and they had gable or hipped roofs with narrow windows. A munitions storage complex was developed at the north end of the field around the same time. Although most of the original structures remain intact, the garage building and the field house were demolished by the Navy in 1941 and 1964, respectively. The Navy stopped using many of these structures after World War II.

During World War II, the Navy built two barracks areas on the southwestern side of the field. The west barracks area comprised two barracks, while the main barracks area was larger. The main barracks also comprised two barracks: an H-shaped building for enlisted officers and a T-shaped building for bachelor officers. However, it also had a mess hall, recreation building, and central square. South of the barracks was a sewage treatment plant. The main barracks were demolished after World War II and were replaced with more permanent barracks areas, which housed veterans. In the 1960s, the Navy built three ranch houses along the coast, which were intended for a planned Armed Forces Reserve Center. The Navy demolished the veterans&#x27; barracks and replaced them with a trailer park containing 24 courts for mobile homes. A three-story school building was built in this area in 1967. In 1970, the Navy demolished the barracks south of Hangar A and completed a new barracks, which was named Tylunas Hall after the late Navy commander John F. Tylunas. Tylunas Hall is now used by the DSNY.

The Coast Guard also constructed frame barracks in 1943 and closed them by 1972. A new concrete barracks was completed in 1979. In 1979, the Coast Guard built a swimming pool on the site of its former barracks.

===Runways===
Floyd Bennett Field contains five concrete runways. Two were laid in 1929, while another two were constructed during the WPA Renovation Project in 1937–1938. Another runway was built in 1942, after the airport was transferred to Navy operation. During the WPA renovations, four turntables were installed to allow planes to turn around quickly. The runways have long since been closed to air traffic. Modern visitors use the runways for flying radio-controlled aircraft, land sailing, and cycling. The end of Runway 19 contains an area where visitors can fly model airplanes. As per International Civil Aviation Organization standards, the runways were numbered based on their alignment: the value on each end was how many tens of degrees off that runway was from facing magnetic north, counting in the clockwise direction and rounding to the nearest whole number. For example, a plane landing on Runway 19 would be facing slightly magnetic southwest since it would be 190 degrees clockwise from magnetic north, while a plane landing on one of the two Runways 6 would be facing magnetic northeast since it would be 60 degrees clockwise from magnetic north.

The two original runways are wide. The Runway 15–33 was lengthened to in 1936. It runs parallel to the original hangars along Flatbush Avenue. Old Runway 6–24 was the longer of the two runways, with a length of , and ran perpendicular to the original hangars. After the WPA renovations in the mid-1930s, the ends of Runway 15–33 were equipped with green runway lights, and that runway was designated as the &quot;blind landing runway&quot; for bad-weather or nighttime landings.

The two runways constructed in 1937–1938 are wide. Runway 1–19 was originally long. It ran from the vicinity of the current main public entrance to the field at the south end of Flatbush Avenue, to the North corner of the field near the Mill Basin Inlet. Runway 12–30 was originally long. It ran from the former Coast Guard Hangar to the Northwest corner of the field near Flatbush Avenue. A brick chimney near Runway 12 was demolished because it was in the way of the flight path. For many years, the U.S. Coast Guard used a section of Runway 12–30 for helicopter operations. The NYPD Aviation Unit uses this same segment.

A new Runway 6–24 was constructed in 1942. This x runway ran perpendicular to Flatbush Avenue, parallel to the old runway 6–24, but was located on the north side of the field. At this time, the old runway 6–24 became taxiways T-1 and T-2. Runways 1–19 and 12–30 were lengthened to x .

Around 1952, Runway 1–19 was expanded again to , and Runway 12–30 was expanded to . The new runway 6–24 was also lengthened to . In 1965, the Hangar Row apron was expanded and Runway 15–33 was modified to become the x taxiway T-10,

There were three seaplane runways on the eastern coast. They were numbered 12–30, 18–36, and 7–25; the first two runways were built as part of the original seaplane base in 1933, while runway 7–25 was added later. There was also a turning basin at the intersection of runways 18–36 and 7–25. The eastern coast also contains a , taxiway for the Coast Guard. It ends in a wooden seaplane ramp that was long by wide.

===Field===
The Goldenrod and Tamarack Campgrounds are located near Hangar B. It is the only legal campground in New York City. However, the 46 campsites in the Floyd Bennett Field campground are classified as primitive: there are only portable toilets, and no electricity is provided.

The General Management Plan of 1979 also called for the maintenance of grasslands around the field. The region&#x27;s grasslands, the Hempstead Plains, had declined from its historic range due to urban sprawl. As a result, the Grasslands Restoration And Management Project (GRAMP), a joint venture between the National Park Service and the Audubon Society, was created to maintain the grasslands in the middle of the field. The area managed by GRAMP consists of about of land at the intersection of runways 6–24 (old), 1–19, and 12–30. It is closed to the public. Runways 1-19 and 12-30 were also vegetated, and vehicular barriers were placed across some of the runways.

The triangle-shaped Ecology Village is located at the south end of the field, between runways 30 and 33. There are several hundred pine trees in the Ecology Village, which were first planted around 1974. The Ecology Village, an environmental education program for students and specially trained teachers in cooperation with the New York City Department of Education, allows classes of students from the fourth to eighth grades to camp there for a night. In the summer, the campgrounds are available on a permit basis for non-profit organizations and certified adult leaders.

The North Forty Natural Area is located on the northern side of the airport, to the south of the Belt Parkway. It was formerly the Navy&#x27;s munition storage area. The natural area contains a hiking trail, a natural woodland area, and a sandy area with shrubs. The freshwater Return-A-Gift pond, built circa 1980, is also located in the North Forty Area, near the clear flight path zone for Runway 12–30.

===Coast===
The former Coast Guard base is located along the eastern coast of Floyd Bennett Field. As originally constructed, it contained a hangar, garage, radio station area, barracks, taxiway, apron, and runway. The former Navy base is also located here. It includes Hangars A and B, barracks, two seaplane ramps, and maintenance buildings.

The Navy developed a boat basin and recreation area along the coast during World War II. After World War II, the Navy renovated the area, demolishing two baseball fields and replacing them with a running track.

==Current use==
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has divisions located on the former airfield. The department&#x27;s aviation base is housed in space leased from the National Park Service that was once CGAS Brooklyn, and is also now headquarters for the New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit. The Driver Training Unit is also located there, using a section of former runway to teach officers to operate many different vehicles used by the department.

The New York City Department of Sanitation Training Center is located in Tylunas Hall, the former Building 278. Part of the former runway is used for training drivers.

The United States Park Police (USPP) operates out of the District 9 station, located in the former Building 275. It is responsible for police coverage of the New York areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The National Park Service&#x27;s Jamaica Bay Unit Headquarters is located in Building 96.

Floyd Bennett Field is home to an annual cycling race series.

A shelter for migrants and asylum-seekers was opened at Floyd Bennett Field in August 2023, despite its relative remoteness.

==Notable flights==
Floyd Bennett Field hosted many famous aviators during the later years of the &quot;Golden Age of Aviation&quot; in the 1930s. This arose from a variety of optimal conditions, including the weather, geography, modern infrastructure, and low commercial usage. As a result, Floyd Bennett Field was either the origin or destination for many record breaking flights, including 26 around-the-world or transoceanic flights and 10 transcontinental flights.

On July 28–30, 1931, Russell Norton Boardman and John Louis Polando flew a Bellanca Special J-300 high-wing monoplane named &quot;Cape Cod&quot; to Istanbul’s Yeşilköy Airport—now Atatürk Airport—in 49:20 hours, establishing a straight-line distance record of . As the runway at Floyd Bennett Field was only long, they needed to remove a fence and clear a parking lot to add another thousand feet to meet their required takeoff distance. The phone and electric utilities even took down poles along Flatbush Avenue. Seventeen minutes after Boardman and Polando departed, Hugh Herndon Jr. and Clyde Pangborn flew a Red Bellanca CH-400 Skyrocket, named &quot;Miss Veedol&quot;, to Moylgrove, Wales, in 31:42 hours. They stopped in Japan on their flight around the world, flew directly to Wenatchee, Washington, on October 4, and landed at Floyd Bennett Field on October 17, 1931.

At least thirteen notable transcontinental flights from 1931 to 1939 either began or ended at Floyd Bennett Field:
* On August 29, 1932, James G. Haizlip flew a Wedell-Williams Model 44, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior engine, from Floyd Bennett Field to Los Angeles, California, in 10:19 hours, establishing a transcontinental record. The same day, Colonel Roscoe Turner also flew a Weddell-Williams, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior engine, to Los Angeles, California, in 10:58:39 hours, having been beaten by Haizlip.
* On November 14, 1932, Turner flew a Weddell-Williams to Burbank, California, in 12:33 hours, establishing a new East–West record.
* On June 2, 1933, Lieutenant Commander Frank Hawks flew a Northrop Gamma, powered by a Wright Whirlwind engine, from Los Angeles, California, to Floyd Bennett Field in 13:26:15 hours, establishing a new West–East non-stop record.
* On July 1, 1933, Colonel Turner flew a Weddell-Williams, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp Junior engine, from Floyd Bennett Field to Los Angeles, California, in 11:30 hours, establishing a new East–West record. On September 25, 1933, Colonel Turner flew the craft from Burbank, California, to Floyd Bennett Field in 10:04:55 hours, establishing a new West–East record. He beat his own record on September 1, 1934, by about two minutes, making the voyage from Burbank to Floyd Bennett Field in 10:02:57 hours.
* On January 15, 1935, Major James H. Doolittle flew an &quot;American Airlines Airplane Development&quot; Vultee, powered by a Wright Cyclone engine, non-stop from Los Angeles, California, to Floyd Bennett Field in 11:59 hours, and established a passenger airplane record for a transcontinental non-stop trip. On February 20–21, 1935, Leland S. Andrews made the same trip in the same type of plane in 11:34:16 hours, beating Doolittle&#x27;s record by almost half an hour.
* On July 11, 1935, Laura Ingalls flew a Lockheed Orion, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engine, from Floyd Bennett Field to Burbank, California, in 18:23:00 hours, establishing an East–West record for women. On September 12, 1935, Ingalls made the return trip in 13:34:05 hours, setting a new record.
* On September 4, 1936, Louise Thaden and Blanche Noyes flew a Beechcraft, powered by a Wright Whirlwind engine, from Floyd Bennett Field to Los Angeles, California, in 14:55:01, and established an East–West transcontinental speed record.
* On December 3, 1938, Jacqueline Cochrane flew a Seversky, powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engines, from Burbank, California, to Floyd Bennett Field in 10:27:55 hours, setting the women&#x27;s West–East transcontinental record.

Famed aviator Wiley Post twice used the field for record-breaking &#x27;round-the-world flights, and developed or adapted technology (such as the Sperry autopilot) there to aid him. Famous aviatrixes of the era, such as Jackie Cochran, Laura Ingalls, and Amelia Earhart broke records at this airfield. Colonel Roscoe Turner was also a frequent visitor at this airfield, often in conjunction with record-breaking flights.

From July 10 to 14, 1938, Howard Hughes and four other aviators used Floyd Bennett Field as the start and finish of their July 1938 record-setting circumnavigation of the globe in ninety-one hours (as depicted in the 2004 film &quot;The Aviator&quot;). Hughes flew a Lockheed 14N Super Electra, around the world in 3 days, 19:08:10 hours. A crowd of 25,000 people greeted his return. Floyd Bennett Field&#x27;s most sensational flight was probably that of Douglas &quot;Wrong Way&quot; Corrigan. Despite having been repeatedly denied permission by the authorities to attempt a non-stop flight to Ireland, he &quot;accidentally&quot; crossed the Atlantic anyway. Corrigan used a second-hand surplus aircraft, a Curtiss Robin powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-6 engine, and his flight was registered to go to California. On July 17–18, 1938, Corrigan flew the craft non-stop from Floyd Bennett Field to Dublin in 28:13 hours. The 31-year-old pilot claimed to have trouble with his compass and never admitted otherwise. Irish authorities placed his aircraft on a ship and repatriated him and his plane. In the midst of the Great Depression, Americans hailed Corrigan for his &quot;accident&quot;, even giving him a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan upon his return.
Other significant events at Floyd Bennett Field during the Golden Age of Aviation included:
* June 3, 1932 – Stanislaus F. Hausner attempted a transatlantic flight from Floyd Bennett Field to Warsaw, Poland, in a Bellanca CH Pacemaker, named &quot;Rose Marie&quot; and powered by a Wright J-6 Whirlwind engine, and made a forced landing at sea.

On July 16, 1957, then-Major John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, established a transcontinental air speed record, flying an F8U-1P Crusader from NAS Los Alamitos, California to NAS New York–Floyd Bennett Field, in 3:23:08 hours. Project Bullet, as the mission was called, provided both the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed, and the first continuous transcontinental panoramic photograph of the United States. Glenn was awarded his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission.

The last record-breaking flights involving Floyd Bennett Field occurred in May 1969 when British Royal Navy F-4K Phantoms set three consecutive speed records for a New York-to-London flight, with a fastest time of 4:46:58 hours. The aircraft were flown to Wisley Airfield in England while competing in the Daily Mail Trans-Atlantic Air Race.
