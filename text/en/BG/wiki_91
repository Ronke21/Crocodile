<text>Elizabeth Lee Wurtzel (July 31, 1967 – January 7, 2020) was an American writer, journalist, and lawyer known for the confessional memoir &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;, which she published at the age of 27. Her work often focused on chronicling her personal struggles with depression, addiction, career, and relationships. Wurtzel&#x27;s work drove a boom in confessional writing and the personal memoir genre during the 1990s, and she was viewed as a voice of Generation X. In her later life, Wurtzel worked briefly as an attorney before her death from breast cancer.

== Early life ==
Wurtzel grew up in a Jewish family on the Upper West Side of New York City and attended the Ramaz School. Her parents, Lynne Winters and Donald Wurtzel, divorced when she was young, and Wurtzel was primarily raised by her mother, who worked in publishing and as a media consultant. In a 2018 article in &quot;The Cut&quot;, Wurtzel wrote that she discovered in 2016 that her biological father was photographer Bob Adelman, who had worked with her mother in the 1960s.

As described in her memoir &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;, Wurtzel&#x27;s depression began between the ages of 10 and 12. Wurtzel admitted to cutting herself when she was in adolescence, and of spending her teenage years in an environment of emotional angst, substance misuse, bad relationships, and frequent fights with family members. A gifted student with family wealth, Wurtzel went on to attend Harvard College, where she continued to struggle with depression and substance abuse.

== Early career ==
While an undergraduate at Harvard in the late 1980s, Wurtzel wrote for &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; and received the 1986 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; College Journalism Award for a piece about Lou Reed. She also interned at &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, but was fired after being accused of plagiarism. She received a B.A. degree in comparative literature from Harvard in 1989.

Wurtzel subsequently moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and found work as a pop music critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; book critic Ken Tucker characterized her contributions to the former publication as &quot;unintentionally hilarious.&quot; In 1997 Dwight Garner wrote in Salon.com that her column &quot;was so roundly despised that I sometimes felt like its only friend in the world.&quot;

== &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; ==
Wurtzel was best known for her best-selling memoir &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; (1994), published when she was 27. The book chronicles her battle with depression as a college undergraduate and her eventual treatment with the medication Prozac. Michiko Kakutani wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; possesses the raw candor of Joan Didion&#x27;s essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath&#x27;s &quot;The Bell Jar&quot;, and the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song.&quot; The paperback was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. The film adaptation, which starred Christina Ricci, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2001.

== &quot;Bitch&quot; ==
Wurtzel&#x27;s first book after &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; was titled &quot;Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women&quot; (1998). The book earned a mixed review from Karen Lehrman in &quot;The New York Times&quot;; Lehrman wrote that while &quot;Bitch&quot; &quot;is full of enormous contradictions, bizarre digressions and illogical outbursts, it is also one of the more honest, insightful and witty books on the subject of women to have come along in a while.&quot;

== &quot;More, Now, Again&quot; ==
&quot;More, Now, Again&quot; (2001), was the follow-up memoir to &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; and centered primarily on her addictions to cocaine and Ritalin. The book discusses her drug induced obsession with tweezing as a form of self-harm, and recounts her behavior while writing &quot;Bitch&quot;, among other subjects. It received generally negative reviews. For &quot;Salon&quot;, Peter Kurth wrote that Wurtzel &quot;imagines that every word she utters and every thought that pops into her head is fraught with meaning and portent. And still her new book goes nowhere.&quot; He called the book &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; characterized the author as an &quot;overage adolescent,&quot; and concluded, &quot;Sorry, Elizabeth. Wake up dead next time and you might have a book on your hands.&quot;

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Toby Young wrote that &quot;Wurtzel&#x27;s overweening self-regard oozes from every sentence&quot; and concluded, &quot;In a sense, &quot;More, Now, Again&quot; is the reductio ad absurdum of this whole self-obsessed genre: it&#x27;s a confessional memoir by someone who has nothing to confess. Wurtzel has nothing to declare apart from her self-adoration. A better title for it would be &quot;Me, Myself, I.&quot;&quot;

&quot;[W]hat a messy load it is,&quot; wrote Pace University professor Judith Schlesinger in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. Schlesinger wrote that Wurtzel focused on &quot;her contempt for other people—including her readers, who are expected to wade through her sloppy story, buy her shallow rationalizations, and tolerate her incessant tone of self-congratulation and entitlement.&quot;

== Law school ==
In 2004, Wurtzel applied to Yale Law School. She later wrote that she never intended to pursue a career as a lawyer, but rather had simply wanted to attend law school. She was accepted at Yale even though &quot;Her combined LSAT score of 160 was, as she put it, &#x27;adequately bad&#x27; ... &#x27;Suffice it to say I was admitted for other reasons,&#x27; Wurtzel said. &#x27;My books, my accomplishments.&#x27;&quot; She was a summer associate at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr. She received her J.D. in 2008, but failed the New York state bar exam on her first attempt.

The legal community criticized Wurtzel for holding herself out as a lawyer in interviews, because she was not licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction at the time. Wurtzel passed the February 2010 New York State bar exam, and was employed full-time at Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner in New York City from 2008 to 2012. She continued to work for the firm as a case manager and on special projects. In July 2010, she wrote in the Brennan Center for Justice blog to make a proposal for the abolition of bar exams.

== Writing career ==

While an intern at the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, Wurtzel was fired, reportedly for plagiarism, although a 2002 &quot;The New York Times&quot; interview suggested that she had fabricated quotations in an article that was never published.

Wurtzel wrote regularly for &quot;The Wall Street Journal.&quot;

On September 21, 2008, after the suicide of writer David Foster Wallace, Wurtzel wrote an article for &quot;New York&quot; magazine about the time she had spent with him. She acknowledged that &quot;I never knew David well.&quot;

In January 2009, she wrote an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, arguing that the vehemence of opposition demonstrated in Europe to Israel&#x27;s actions in the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, when compared to the international reaction to human rights abuses in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Darfur, and Arab countries, suggested an antisemitic undercurrent fueling the outrage.

In 2009, Wurtzel published an article in &quot;Elle&quot; magazine about societal pressures related to aging. Regretting her youth of casual sex and drug-taking, and realizing that she was not as beautiful as she once had been, she reflected that &quot;whoever said youth is wasted on the young actually got it wrong; it&#x27;s more that maturity is wasted on the old.&quot;

Wurtzel&#x27;s publisher, Penguin, sued her in September 2012 in an effort to reclaim a $100,000 advance for a 2003 book contract for &quot;a book for teenagers to help them cope with depression&quot; that Wurtzel failed to complete. Of the $100,000, Penguin advanced Wurtzel $33,000 and sought interest of $7,500, claiming to have suffered detriment at Wurtzel&#x27;s expense. The case was dismissed with prejudice in 2013.

In early 2013, Wurtzel published a &quot;New York&quot; magazine article lamenting the unconventional choices she had made in life, including heroin use and spending much of a lucrative publisher advance on a costly Birkin bag, and her failure to marry, have children, buy a house, save money or invest for retirement. &quot;At long last, I had found myself vulnerable to the worst of New York City, because at 44 my life was not so different from the way it was at 24,&quot; she wrote. The article was widely criticized. In &quot;Slate&quot;, Amanda Marcotte called the piece Wurtzel&#x27;s &quot;latest word dump&quot; and remarked that it was &quot;as lengthy as it is incoherent.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Noreen Malone said of the piece that &quot;Wurtzel wants us to know that she&#x27;s a mess, and kindly invites us to rubberneck.&quot; Prachi Gupta for &quot;Salon&quot; characterized the essay as &quot;rambling&quot; and &quot;self-involved.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Meghan Daum called the piece &quot;self-aggrandizing, disjointed, and, in its most egregious moments, leaves the impression that her editors might have been egging her on—or worse, taking advantage of what sometimes looks like a fairly precarious psychological state—in order to ensure maximum blogospheric outrage.&quot; By contrast, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Jia Tolentino called the piece &quot;one of the best things she ever wrote.&quot;

In January 2015, Wurtzel published a short book titled &quot;Creatocracy&quot; under Thought Catalog&#x27;s publishing imprint, TC Books. It is based on the thesis she wrote about intellectual property law upon graduation from Yale Law school.

== Personal life ==
Wurtzel met photo editor and aspiring novelist James Freed Jr. in October 2013 at an addiction-themed reading. They became engaged in September 2014 and married in May 2015, while she was undergoing therapy. The couple later separated, but remained close. They completed their divorce papers, but never filed them; they were still married when she died.

In a 2018 article in &quot;The Cut&quot;, Wurtzel wrote that she discovered in 2016 that her biological father was photographer Bob Adelman, who had worked with her mother in the 1960s. As a result, she labeled herself a bastard.

=== Illness and death ===
In February 2015, Wurtzel announced she had breast cancer, &quot;which like many things that happen to women is mostly a pain in the ass. But compared with being 26 and crazy and waiting for some guy to call, it&#x27;s not so bad. If I can handle 39 breakups in 21 days, I can get through cancer.&quot; She said of her double mastectomy and reconstruction, &quot;It is quite amazing. They do both at the same time. You go in with breast cancer and come out with stripper boobs.&quot;

Wurtzel died in Manhattan from leptomeningeal disease as a complication of metastasized breast cancer on January 7, 2020, at age 52.

Her personal effects were sold at auction two years later.

<doc id="321247" wikidata="Q1151136" url="?curid=321247" title="Nine-rank system">
<text>The nine-rank system, also known as the nine-grade controller system, was used to categorize and classify government officials by rank in Imperial China. Their accorded rank signified their status in the government hierarchy and the amount of wages they earned. Created by the politician Chen Qun in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms, it was used until the Song dynasty, and similar ranking systems were also present in the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty.

A similar system was also used in Korea. In Japan, the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System was adopted in 603 during the reign of Empress Suiko.

==History==
===Background===
Prior to the nine-rank system, official positions were denoted by their salary paid in number of bushels of grain. For example, during the Han dynasty, the highest-ranking officials were classed as &quot;wandan&quot; (萬石), meaning ten thousand bushels, and were paid 350 bushels of grain per month. The lowest ranking petty subofficials were paid in pecks, worth less than 100 bushels per year.

The Nine-rank system was a reorganization of the Han dynasty practice of recommending noteworthy locals for political office. Since 134 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the Han court relied mainly on nomination by local magnates and officials as a way of identifying talent, by nominating them under titles such as &quot;Xiaolian&quot; (, Filial and Incorrupt) or &quot;Maocai&quot; (, of Outstanding Talent).

The nine-rank system was created after the end of the Han in 220 AD when Chen Qun, a court official from the state of Cao Wei, proposed it as a way of organizing the state bureaucracy. It was called the &quot;nine-rank method for recruiting men for office&quot; (&quot;Jiǔ pǐn guān rén fǎ&quot;; ). During the Song dynasty it became the &quot;system of Nine ranks and impartial judges.&quot;

Chen Qun&#x27;s reform was a way of systematizing the selection of candidates for political appointments in two ways: by creating a common scale of nine ranks to evaluate a person and by appointing Controllers () in the court to grade officials on the scale. In practice, not only potential entrants but also existing officials were graded, creating two parallel systems: a &quot;candidacy grade&quot; and a &quot;service grade&quot; . The system was ostensibly based on a few criteria: moral probity, administrative ability, and the contributions of the person or his family to the newly created Cao Wei regime. In practice, descent also played an important role; the service grade of a candidate&#x27;s father had a bearing on their candidacy grade.

The nine-rank system was originally intended to centralize the power of nominating and selecting appointees to office into the imperial court at Luoyang, but conflict remained between the right of evaluation between centrally-appointed Controllers and the governors of the regions. Nonetheless, the continued instability and turmoil of the Three Kingdoms period meant that the nine-rank system was not fully or solely implemented; mentions of the old nomination system as the basis for identifying talent remain prevalent in early Cao Wei writings.

The nine-rank system would become more dominant in the later years of the Cao Wei regime under the regency of the Sima clan and into the early years of the Jin regime during which it had changed in nature. Under Sima Yan, the power of Controllers was expanded to include not only evaluation but also the nomination of talent, and with the conquest of Wu by Jin and the subsequent peace, the system also became more systematized and formalized. Through the changes, the nine-rank system also became more closely aligned with the interests of the powerful official clans who had come to dominate imperial politics since the Cao Wei period. The expanded powers of the appointed Controllers in turn meant that the officials who held the post, many of whom came from these clans, could use their powers to promote the interests of their own scions.

While the nine-rank system helped powerful clans to dominate official posts in the court, it also helped stimulate private schooling within families as a means of transmitting knowledge that could increase one&#x27;s standing as someone eligible for evaluation. An example of this intrafamilial transmission of skills is the calligrapher Wang Xizhi, of the Wang clan of Langya that was prominent during the Eastern Jin, whose sons, Wang Ningzhi, Wang Huizhi and Wang Xianzhi, were all famed calligraphers in their own right. The emphasis placed by the nine-rank system on moral attributes such as filial piety also led to the growth of &quot;familial instructions&quot; (), which aimed to transmit moral teachings to children, as a genre of writing in the Jin and subsequent dynasties.

During the Northern Wei, ranks four to nine added additional upper and lower ranks to the standard and secondary ranks, giving the nine-rank system a total of 30 ranks (6 in the top 3 ranks; 24 from ranks 4 to 9).

After the Northern Song the nine ranks reverted to the original standard of 18 ranks, with each rank containing only two classes.

===Organization===
The upper ranks were 1 − the highest — to 3, the middle were 4 to 6, and the lower were 7 to 9. Each rank had two classes − standard and secondary − for 18 steps. From the Northern Wei to before the Northern Song, classes from ranks 4 to 9 were further divided into upper and lower grades for 30 steps.

Ranks were expressed as class, rank, then grade; for example: Standard class, Rank 4, Upper grade ().

Prestige titles were also awarded, normally based on seniority, to confer status among officials of the same rank.

From the Han to the Sui, local recruiters recommended official candidates. Social status became the most important criterion, and powerful local families secured places in government; this led to the saying: &quot;There are no poor people in the upper ranks and no powerful families in the lower ones.&quot; Centralization during the Sui and Tang reduced the power of the local elites, and candidates started to be selected by the imperial examination system instead of by recommendations. By the Song, recruitment through examination was the norm.

<text>Waterloo is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, in Merseyside, England. Together with Seaforth, the two setlements make up the borough&#x27;s Church ward. The area is bordered by Crosby to the north, Seaforth to the south, the Rimrose Valley country park to the east, and to the west Crosby Beach and Crosby Coastal Park.

Crosby Beach begins in Waterloo at the Crosby Marine Park and stretches 3 miles up to Hightown. The beach is the location of Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot; sculpture. 

The town is connected to Liverpool in the south and Southport to the north by Merseyrail&#x27;s Northern line at Waterloo station.

==History==
Waterloo was historically part of Lancashire and originally an area of Crosby, named Crosby Seabank. At that time it consisted mostly of cottages, the beachfront, sand-hills and fields. The area grew in popularity with wealthy visitors from Liverpool, prompting the planning and construction of a large hotel in the Georgian style to be named the &quot;Crosby Seabank Hotel&quot;. The grand opening coincided with 18 June 1816, the first anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, and was named the &quot;Royal Waterloo Hotel&quot; in honour of the event. Gradually, as the population increased and the area became an identifiable location it became known as Waterloo, with several streets taking the name of names associated with the battle cementing the association.

Some of the buildings in Waterloo such as the Grade II Listed Potters Barn park buildings are replicas of those found in Waterloo, Belgium.

==Governance==
On 31 December 1894 Waterloo became a civil parish, formed from the part of Great Crosby parish in Waterloo with Seaforth Urban District, and subsequently became part of the municipal borough of Crosby in 1937. In 1951 the parish had a population of 16,997. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished and the Municipal Borough of Crosby became part of the newly created Metropolitan Borough of Sefton.

From 1918 until 1950 Waterloo was within the Parliamentary seat known as the Waterloo constituency, a safe seat for the Conservative Party. From 1950 until 2010 Waterloo was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency. From 1997 to 2010 the Member of Parliament (MP) was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party; prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold, like its predecessor seat, with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election, the Crosby constituency was abolished and Waterloo was included in the expanded Bootle constituency. The town has been represented by Labour MP Peter Dowd since 2015.

For elections to Sefton Council, the southern part of Waterloo is within the electoral ward of Church and is represented by three councillors. The northern part from St John&#x27;s Rd to Queensway is in Victoria ward and is represented by another three councillors.

==Landmarks==
Waterloo is made up of predominately Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian villas, mews and terraces, facing the sea. The South Road offers shops and restaurants. A series of public gardens – built as a job creation scheme during the 1930s Great Depression – run adjacent to the esplanade that abuts the marina leading to the coast and beach.

===Chaffers Running Track===

Chaffers Running Track was established in the early 1960s. Southport Waterloo Running Club used the cinder track as their base for about 15 years until the Litherland Park Sports Centre was built in 2007. Chaffers fell into disuse until plans were announced in 2020 to restore it. It is now the home of the Marsh Lane Harriers running club.

===Rimrose Valley Wildflower Meadow===
In 2019, a 3 acre wildflower meadow was established instigated by local resident Linda Gaskell with help from Sefton Councillor Michael Roche. The meadow is located within the former athletic track At Chafer&#x27;s Fields. The varieties were selected by Richard Scott of the Eden Project and include Cornflower, sunflower, field marigold, camomile and poppies. It is planned to extend the meadow each year along the Valley.

===The Marina===

The Marina is a stretch of fields and protected natural wildlife area near the Marina Lake. The area begins adjacent to the Royal Seaforth Dock. A path runs through the Marina toward the sand dunes of Crosby Beach, it is the main route taken by foot to get to the beach, beginning at the top of South Road, Waterloo. The Marina has a café (Waterloo Place opened in 2015) and the Crosby Lakeside Adventure Centre (opened in early 2010).

===Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot;===
The beach at Waterloo is the permanent home of Antony Gormley&#x27;s &quot;Another Place&quot;. The permanent art installation consists of figures of cast iron facing out to sea, spread over a 2 mile (3.2 km) stretch of the beach between Waterloo and Blundellsands.

===The Plaza Community Cinema===
The Plaza Cinema has been a part of the fabric of Waterloo since 1939. The opening coincided with the outbreak of World War II forcing it to immediately close its doors under wartime restrictions until the public order was rescinded by the government. Originally named &quot;The Plaza&quot;, it has changed hands numerous times during its life, becoming known as &quot;The Odeon&quot; in the 1950s, &quot;The Classic&quot; in the 1970s and &quot;The Apollo&quot; in the 1990s.

In 1996 the cinema was closed when the owners decided to sell the property for redevelopment. After numerous petitions the cinema was reopened on 18 July 1997 under a community trust and its original name restored. After successfully raising money to secure equipment, the re-opened cinema was staffed entirely by volunteers apart from the projectionist. After the support of British Film Commissioner Sir Sydney Samuelson the cinema was able to secureThe Lost World: Jurassic Park as first film to be shown. Since then The Plaza has been a focal community point in Waterloo, offering Autism friendly screenings, Kids clubs and social clubs. In September 2009 the Plaza celebrated its 70th anniversary.

In May 2010, the venue hosted the celebration event for the &quot;Who I Am and Where I&#x27;m From&quot; project which showcased a collection of animations produced by the Polish Community in Sefton called &quot;Polska Tales&quot;.

In July 2011 the cinema completed an £80,000 refurbishment that saw Sir Sydney Samuelson attend its reopening ceremony.

In 2016 the Plaza was awarded a Queen&#x27;s Award for Voluntary Service.

==Education==
There are three primary schools: Waterloo Primary, St. Johns C of E Primary, and St Edmunds &amp; St Thomas&#x27;s RC. Local high schools are in Crosby.

==Transport==
The district is served by Waterloo station on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. Waterloo is connected to Liverpool by the Dock Road. The number 53 bus runs through South Road, Waterloo and into Liverpool City centre.

==Sport==
Waterloo was home to Waterloo rugby club who took their name from the area, having played there from 1884 until 1892 before moving back to Blundellsands. In 1992, they famously defeated then English champions and cup holders Bath 9-8 in a fourth round cup tie. The marina in Waterloo, and adjacent Crosby Lakeside Adventure Centre, is home to the Crosby Scout and Guide Marina Club.

<doc id="321251" wikidata="Q1533927" url="?curid=321251" title="Godspell">
<text>Godspell is a musical in two acts with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by John-Michael Tebelak. The show is structured as a series of parables, primarily based on the Gospel of Matthew, interspersed with music mostly set to lyrics from traditional hymns, with the passion of Christ appearing briefly near the end.

&quot;Godspell&quot; began as a project by drama students at Carnegie Mellon University and then moved to the off-off-Broadway theater La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. The show was rescored for an off-Broadway production, which opened on May 17, 1971, and became a long-running success. Many productions have followed worldwide, including a 2011 Broadway revival. An abbreviated one-act version of the musical designed for performers aged 18 and under also exists, titled &quot;Godspell Junior&quot;.

Several cast albums have been released over the years. &quot;Day by Day&quot;, from the original cast album, reached #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop singles chart in the summer of 1972 and #7 in Canada.

==Characters==
The show features eight non-Biblical characters, who sing and act out the parables: Gilmer (silly, a great storyteller); Robin (a tomboy); Herb (goofy and entertaining); Jeffrey (happy and excited); Joanne (eager and enthusiastic); Lamar (clumsy and unintentionally funny); Peggy (shy and loyal); and Sonia (dramatic with a put-on sensuality). In the original script, licensed through Theatre Maximus, the &quot;Christ&quot; character and the &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Judas&quot; role are assigned the names of the original performers, Stephen and David. All ten actors are on stage throughout the entirety of the production.

In the revised script used for the 2011 Broadway revival, the names of the cast are again assigned to the non-Biblical roles: Nick, Telly, George, Anna Maria, Lindsay, Uzo, Morgan, and Celisse. Each character is also assigned a few character traits. An ensemble can also be added to the production if needed.

== Casts ==
Since the names of the characters are normally changed to the cast members&#x27; names in professional productions, the names here match the character&#x27;s main solo, excluding Jesus and John/Judas. These are the names the characters are referred to in the licensing of the show.

Notable replacements include: Corbin Bleu as Jesus (Broadway 2011), Sonia Manzano (Broadway 1976), Don Scardino (Canada 1972), Dave Thomas (Canada 1972), and Victor Garber (Off-Broadway 1972).

== Synopsis ==
=== Act I ===
The show opens with God&#x27;s voice, as spoken by Jesus, declaring his supremacy: &quot;My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end.&quot; (&quot;Opening (Monologue)&quot;). The cast then enters and takes the roles of various philosophers who sing their philosophies, first alone, then in cacophonous counterpoint (&quot;Prologue: Tower of Babble&quot;).

In response, John the Baptist enters blowing a shofar to call the community to order. He then beckons them to &quot;Prepare Ye, The Way of the Lord!&quot; and baptizes the cast (&quot;Prepare Ye&quot;). John gives a short sermon, as Jesus watches quietly. Jesus then announces his presence and says that he also wishes to be baptized. John instead asks to be baptized by Jesus. Jesus explains that &quot;We do well now to conform with all that God requires&quot; and is baptized by John. The cast enters and sings with Jesus (&quot;Save the People&quot;).

In his first parable, Jesus explains that he has come &quot;not to abolish the law and the prophets, but to complete.&quot; Jesus explains to the cast that those who adhere to the law of God will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of Heaven. He tells them the parable of the Widow and the Judge, demonstrating that God is a just jurist who will support those who cry out to him.

The cast begins to understand Jesus&#x27; teachings and take it upon themselves to tell the story of the Pharisee and the Publican praying in the temple: &quot;Every man who humbles himself shall be exalted!&quot;

As Jesus teaches the law of the offering gifts at the altar, the cast makes offerings of themselves. They are taught that to approach God&#x27;s altar, they must be pure of heart and soul. They then act out the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant a story of a master and a servant who owes him a debt. The servant asks his master for pity in repaying the debt, and the master absolves it. The servant then turns to a fellow servant who &quot;owed him a few dollars&quot; and demands that it be paid in full. The master, hearing this, then condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: &quot;Forgive your brothers from your heart.&quot; The character telling the parable sings &quot;Day by Day&quot;, and the cast joins in. After the song, Jesus teaches that if one part of you offends God, it is better to lose it than to have the whole of the body thrown into hell.

The cast then plays charades to finish several statements posed by Jesus, including &quot;If a man sues you for your shirt...&quot; and &quot;If a man asks you to go one mile with him...&quot; The cast then performs the Parable of the Good Samaritan as a play-within-a-play. Jesus explains the need to &quot;love your enemies&quot; and &quot;not make a show of religion before men&quot;. He says: &quot;God will reward a good deed done in secret&quot; (&quot;Shhh! It&#x27;s a secret!&quot;).

The cast then performs the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. On earth, the rich man feasts, and Lazarus begs and is ignored. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded with Heaven, while the rich man is in Hell. The audience is told to &quot;Learn Your Lessons Well&quot; or be faced with eternal damnation. When the rich man asks Abraham if he would send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers of their impending doom, Abraham tells him no: &quot;If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead.&quot;

Jesus teaches that no man can serve two masters (God and money). A member of the cast tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring the good things in life, then dies before he has the time to enjoy them. This character sings &quot;Bless the Lord,&quot; then Jesus tells the cast not to worry about tomorrow: &quot;Tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has problems of its own.&quot;

In an antiphonic chorus, the cast recites the Beatitudes. Judas directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject (&quot;Did I ever tell you that I used to read feet?&quot;). However, Jesus then persuades the cast that it is &quot;All for the Best&quot; and heaven contains the ultimate reward as Jesus and Judas do a soft shoe together.

This is followed by the parable of the Sower of the Seeds, which Jesus tells them represent the Word of God (&quot;All Good Gifts&quot;).

By this point in the musical, the group has transformed from a rag-tag cast, into a community of love and caring and now march as soldiers in the military, signifying their ability to think as one. With Jesus as the drill sergeant, they perform the Parable of the Prodigal Son. The cast sings &quot;Light of the World&quot; about Christ&#x27;s Light and how it shines in each person.

=== Intermission ===
Jesus thanks the audience for coming and announces a 10-minute intermission.

There is audience interaction during intermission. In the original production, the cast joined the audience for wine and bread. In the 2011 Broadway revival, the audience was offered wine on the stage.

The second act then opens with one or more cast members singing &quot;Learn Your Lessons Well&quot;, calling the audience back to their seats.

=== Act II ===
After the reprise of &quot;Learn Your Lessons Well&quot;, a member of the cast sings &quot;Turn Back, O Man&quot;, imploring mankind to give up its temporal pursuits and turn to God. Jesus then says: &quot;This is the beginning.&quot;

Several members of the cast then begin to question Jesus&#x27;s authority, and he responds with yet another parable. He is asked, &quot;What is the greatest commandment?&quot; and responds, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul... And the second is like it: &#x27;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x27;&quot; The Pharisees continue to question him, and he laments &quot;Alas for You&quot; and calls them hypocrites. Members of the cast gather, join in Jesus&#x27; song, and throw garbage at the Pharisees.

Jesus predicts that he will not be seen for quite a while, while standing at the &quot;Wailing Wall&quot;, and predicts great wars and famines. He reminds the cast and audience of the time of Noah and teaches that faith can calm the storm. The cast is told: &quot;Keep awake, then. For the Son of Man will come at a time when you least expect it.&quot;

One woman in the cast is shunned as an adulteress. Jesus says: &quot;Let the one of you who is faultless cast the first stone.&quot; Her accusers then bow their heads and walk away. Jesus walks over to her and asks: &quot;Woman... where are they now? Has no one condemned you?&quot; The woman answers: &quot;No one, sir.&quot; He tells her: &quot;Then nor shall I. You may go, but do not sin again.&quot; As she watches Jesus walk from her, she entreats him to remain &quot;By My Side&quot;. During this song, Judas foretells his upcoming betrayal of Jesus.

In one of the lighter moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will separate men as a shepherd separates his flock into sheep and goats. The sheep will enter heaven while the goats must suffer eternal damnation. &quot;We Beseech Thee&quot; cry the goats, begging for mercy.

After the song, the cast reminds each other to take things &quot;Day by Day&quot;, as they remove their clown makeup, face paint, or object. They assemble for the Last Supper and Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Each member of the cast asks, &quot;Is it I?&quot; ending with Judas: &quot;Rabbi... can you mean me?&quot; Jesus tells him to do quickly what he must do and Judas runs off. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine, while saying the traditional Hebrew Seder blessings. He tells his followers that they will dine together in the Kingdom of Heaven. The band sings &quot;On the Willows&quot;, which is about what has been sacrificed. In the song, Jesus blesses each member of the cast. He asks that they wait for him as he goes into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.

In the garden, Jesus implores God to let the burden be lifted from his shoulders if there is another way. Jesus returns to his followers to find them all asleep. He begs them to stay awake, but they all fall asleep again and Jesus warns them they will all betray him three times (a reference to the apostle Peter). Jesus then prays to God that if his death cannot pass him by, then His will must be done. He is then tempted by Satan (usually played by the apostles), but orders him away.

Judas returns to betray Jesus, but has a moment where he cannot bring himself to do it. He tries to leave but finds himself boxed in by invisible walls, except for one path which leads to Jesus. Jesus encourages Judas to do what he has come to do, and Judas grabs Jesus to bring him to be crucified. The community starts to attack Judas, while Jesus tells them to stop, as all who live by the sword will one day die by it. Judas (usually alone, as a representation of the others arresting Jesus) ties Jesus upon an electric fence (representative of the cross) as Jesus berates him for arresting him at night, but then says that it had to happen to fulfill the prophets&#x27; writings.

The &quot;Finale&quot; begins, loud and in B-minor, with Jesus wailing, &quot;Oh, God, I&#x27;m bleeding,&quot; and the community answers: &quot;Oh, God, You&#x27;re bleeding.&quot; Jesus dies and the music ends. The women of the cast sing &quot;Long Live God&quot;, and the men join in with &quot;Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord&quot; in counterpoint. The cast removes Jesus from the fence and carries him out, either offstage or through the aisles. The cast then finishes with a reprise of &quot;Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord&quot;.

=== Ending interpretation ===
Similar to criticism of the 1970 rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; there is controversy over there being no obvious allusion to the Resurrection of Jesus in the show. It can be interpreted that either the singing of &quot;Prepare Ye&quot; in the finale or the curtain call, where all including Jesus return to the stage, represents the resurrection. The Music Theatre International script states that either representation is valid.

===Tower of Babble===
&quot;Tower of Babble,&quot; the show&#x27;s opening number, has often been omitted in productions. The song consists of the eight disciples (or soloists) acting out as philosophers, each singing about their various philosophies. They grow increasingly more irritated with each other, sing in contradiction, and eventually run out of words. &quot;Prepare Ye&quot; follows this prologue.

In the original productions, the philosophers were Socrates (Jeffrey Mylett), Thomas Aquinas (Peggy Gordon), Martin Luther (Lamar Alford), Leonardo da Vinci (Gilmer McCormick), Edward Gibbon (Sonia Manzano), Jean-Paul Sartre (Joanne Jonas), Friedrich Nietzsche (Robin Lamont), and Buckminster Fuller (Herb Braha). In the 2001 revival, Luther, Gibbon, Nietzsche, and Fuller were replaced by Galileo Galilei, Jonathan Edwards, L. Ron Hubbard, and Marianne Williamson, respectively. The 2011 revival retains Galilei, Hubbard, and Williamson, but restores Gibbon and replaces da Vinci with Georg Hegel.

On many early cast recordings, including the original off-Broadway recording and the original London recording, the prologue was omitted in order to produce an album that could sell as a pop album. This omission was for marketing purposes and was not meant to diminish the importance of the number, as Stephen Schwartz has repeatedly stated. As a consequence, some audiences have gotten the impression that this number was added into the score later.

===Beautiful City===
&quot;Beautiful City&quot; was written in 1972 as part of the film and re-written in 1993 after the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. In the film, it follows &quot;Alas for You&quot; and &quot;By My Side&quot;, omitting the parable typically found in between these two numbers.

In the decades following the film&#x27;s release, many directors have chosen to use the lyrics from the original film version, sometimes to replace the &quot;Day by Day&quot; reprise, &quot;Tower of Babble&quot;, like the prologue, or adding it the end of the musical as an additional scene depicting the Resurrection.

The 2011 Broadway revival places &quot;Beautiful City&quot; after &quot;We Beseech Thee&quot; and just before the Last Supper, sung by Jesus as a slow ballad. This production used the revised 1993 lyrics and is included on its cast recording, along with a cover by John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting as a bonus track.

Some productions use both the original upbeat film version as a prologue as well as the ballad version, either in its original place just before the Last Supper whereupon the &quot;Day by Day&quot; reprise is used as the Resurrection, or as an epilogue depicting the resurrection itself.

In Music Theater International&#x27;s Broadway Junior series, which edits popular musicals to one act appropriate for a middle school cast, &quot;Beautiful City&quot; is included in the show. &quot;Godspell Junior&quot; contains most of the first act and almost none of the second act. &quot;By My Side&quot; is omitted entirely. &quot;Beautiful City&quot; is placed at the beginning of the second act and is immediately followed by the Last Supper, the Betrayal, and the Crucifixion.

==Production history==

===1970: Carnegie Mellon University===
John-Michael Tebelak wrote the first version of &quot;Godspell&quot; as his master&#x27;s thesis at Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie Mellon cast included (listed in speaking order): Andrew Rohrer, Mary Mazziotti, Martha Jacobs, Robin Lamont, Robert Miller, Sonia Manzano, Stanley King, Randy Danson, James Stevens, and David Haskell with original music by Duane Bolick. Ted Danson has mentioned that he was cast in this original production on several occasions but had to leave the production due to a case of Bell&#x27;s palsy. This version was performed at Carnegie Mellon in 1970 by students from Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Theatre Department.

===1971: La MaMa and off-Broadway===
The show was then brought to the attention of producers Edgar Lansbury (brother of Angela Lansbury), Joseph Beruh, and Stuart Duncan by Carnegie Mellon alumnus and associate producer Charles Haid, who wanted to transfer the show to off-Broadway. The show was first produced at La Mama as a play with original music for eight songs by Duane Bolick, Jeffrey Mylett, who added one of his songs (&quot;The Raven and The Swan&quot;) and Peggy Gordon and Jay Hamburger, who added &quot;By My Side&quot;. The producers then hired Stephen Schwartz, another Carnegie Mellon alumnus, to re-score the show. Schwartz&#x27;s score incorporated a variety of musical genres, including pop, folk rock, gospel, and vaudeville. &quot;By My Side&quot;, written by Carnegie Mellon students Jay Hamburger and Peggy Gordon, was kept from the original score. As in the original score, most of the lyrics not written by Schwartz were from the Episcopal hymnal. The show opened as a musical at the Cherry Lane Theatre on May 17, 1971. It transferred to the Promenade Theatre three months later, and closed on June 13, 1976, after 2,124 performances at the Promenade. This production was directed by Tebelak, and the original cast included Lamar Alford, Peggy Gordon, David Haskell, Joanne Jonas, Robin Lamont, Sonia Manzano, Gilmer McCormick, Jeffrey Mylett, Stephen Nathan, and Herb Braha (Simon). The band included Jesse Cutler on guitar and bass, Richard LaBonte on bass, Stephen Reinhardt on keyboards, and Ricky Shutter on drums and percussion. In late 1971, LaBonte was replaced by bassist Steve Manes when two of the original musicians, Shutter and LaBonte, went with the majority of the original cast to The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles to open the show there. With the exception of LaBonte, they all returned to the Promenade in January 1972.

===1971: Melbourne, Australia===
The first production after the off-Broadway show opened at the Playbox Theatre in Melbourne, Australia on November 15, 1971. The cast included Colleen Hewett, Collette Mann, Christopher Pate, and George Spartels. The producers, Aztec Services and Williamson Edgley Theatres, opened a second production in Sydney on April 10, 1972. Peta Toppano, John Waters, and Marty Rhone were in the Sydney production. Melbourne played 504 performances and Sydney played 507 before the two companies went on tour, performing another 700 shows.

===1971: London, England===
&quot;Godspell&quot; opened at the Roundhouse Theatre in Chalk Farm, London on November 17, 1971. This London production featured Jacquie-Ann Carr, Julie Covington, David Essex, Neil Fitzwiliam, Jeremy Irons, Verity-Anne Meldrum, Deryk Parkin, Tom Saffery, Gay Soper, and Marti Webb. After a successful run at the Roundhouse Theatre, the production transferred to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre, also in London, on January 26, 1972. with Barry Stokes.

===1972: Washington, D.C.===
The Washington, D.C. production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, at Ford&#x27;s Theater, ran from 1972 into 1973. The cast consisted of Bartley Braverman, Scotch Byerley, Baillie Gerstein, Tony Hoty, Maggie Hyatt, Doris Jamin, Irving Lee, Dean Pitchford, John-Ann Washingson and Lynne Thigpen.

===1972: Chicago===
The 1972-1973 Chicago production played at the Studebaker Theatre, with a cast of Richard Gilliland (Jesus), Joe Mantegna (Judas), JoAnn Brown-El, Sammy Chester, Karla DeVito, Carol McGill, Jim Parks, Tricia Smith, Dan Stone, and Fran Uditsky.

=== 1972: Toronto ===
The 1972–1973 Toronto production opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre and was intended to be a run of a few dozen performances for a subscription audience. The cast was drawn entirely from local performers, instead of a touring cast. After an enthusiastic response from the audience, the scheduled run at the Royal Alexandra ended and the show moved uptown to the Bayview Playhouse in Leaside. The Bayview Playhouse production ran until August 1973, with a then-record run of 488 performances.

The Toronto production launched the careers of many actors, including Victor Garber, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Gilda Radner, Dave Thomas, and Martin Short, as well as the show&#x27;s musical director, Paul Shaffer. Howard Shore played saxophone for this production.

===1973: Maseru (Lesotho, Southern Africa)===
Godspell opened in Maseru, Lesotho in 1973 and ran for five months. When Des and Dawn Lindberg brought the show to the University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg), it was immediately banned on the grounds of blasphemy. The ban was widely recognized as a political response to the depiction of racial mixing, which presented a direct challenge to apartheid in South Africa.

The Lindbergs challenged the ban in the Supreme Court and won their case. As a result, &quot;Godspell&quot; toured South Africa for two years and opened doors to all races on both sides of the footlights. This production was both a theatrical triumph and a political and legal breakthrough.

=== 1974: Tehran, Iran ===
The Tehran production was staged at the Iran-America Society by the Masquers theater group, under the direction of Pat Zich, with musical direction by Richard and Georgia Bassett. The cast, crew and musicians were drawn from American, British and Iranian students, teachers and expatriates. The production ran for 7 days in April &#x27;74, with matinee and evening performances.

=== 1976: Broadway ===
The first Broadway production opened on June 22, 1976, at the Broadhurst Theatre. It was directed by John Michael Tebelak, with Steve Reinhardt as musical director, costumes by Susan Tsu, lighting by Spencer Mosse, and sound by Robert Minor. The opening cast featured Lamar Alford, Laurie Faso, Lois Foraker, Robin Lamont, Elizabeth Lathram, Bobby Lee, Tom Rolfing, Don Scardino, Marley Sims, and Valerie Williams. Kerin Blair, Bob Garrett, Michael Hoit, and Kitty Rea were understudies. The band consisted of Paul Shaffer (keyboards, conductor), Mark Zeray (guitar), Chris Warwin (bass), and Michael Redding (percussion).

The show transferred to the Plymouth Theatre, then to the Ambassador Theatre, where it closed on September 4, 1977, after 5 previews and 527 performances.

=== 1981: La MaMa revival ===
Ten years after the original production of &quot;Godspell&quot; and twenty years after the theater&#x27;s founding, the musical was revived at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in Manhattan. Tebelak directed the 1981 production, with Robert Stecko as musical directed. The cast included Lamar Alford, Kerin Blair, R. Bruce Connelly, Michael Hoit, Paul Kreppel, Sonia Manzano, Melanie Mayron, Marilyn Pasekoff, Leslie Ann Ray, and Jeremy Sage, with Danny Rutigliano as understudy. John Michael Tebelak then flew to Los Angeles where a west coast tenth anniversary reunion production was staged featuring original cast members Peggy Gordon, Stephen Nathan, Herb Braha, Jeffrey Mylett, Gilmer McCormick and David Haskell, with Marley Sims, Patti Mariano, Jeannie Lange, Bob Garrett and original musical director Stephen Reinhardt.

=== 1988: Off-Broadway ===
The Lamb&#x27;s Theatre revival ran from June 12 through December 31, 1988. It was directed by Don Scardino, with Steven M. Alper as musical director and Doug Besterman as assistant musical director, and with new musical arrangements by Steven M. Alper and Doug Besterman. Costumes were by David C. Woolard, lighting was by Phil Monat, and sound was by T. Richard Fitzgerald. The cast included Trini Alvarado, Anne Bobby (credited as Anne Marie Bobby), Bill Damaschke, Laura Dean, Angel Jemmott, Eddie Korbich, Mia Korf, Robert McNeill, Harold Perrineau, (credited as Harold Perrineau Jr.), and Jeffrey Steefel.

=== 2001: North American touring revival ===
From September 29 to June 3 of 2001, a production of &quot;Godspell&quot; toured the United States and Canada. The production was directed by Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s son Scott Schwartz, while the music was arranged by Alex Lacamoire. The cast included Todd Buonopane, Joseph J. Carney, Jessica Carter, Sharon Francis, Esteban Girón, Sarah Hubbard, Natalie Joy Johnson, Kevin Smith Kirkwood, Lauren Lebowitz, Sal Sabella, and Michael Yuen.

===2011: Broadway revival===

On April 17, 2012, Corbin Bleu took over the role of Jesus. The 2011 cast recording was released digitally on December 20, 2011, and in stores on January 31, 2012. The production closed on June 24, 2012.

=== 2016: São Paulo, Brazil ===

This production featured Leonardo Miggiorin, Beto Sargentelli, Gabriela Medvedovski, Matheus Severo, Artur Volpi, Juliana Peppi, Rafael Pucca, Nathália Borges, Mariana Nunes, Fernanda Cascardo, Pri Esteves, Pedro Navarro e Adler Henrique.

===2020: Berkshire Theatre Group===

Godspell became the first live show to be approved by the Actors&#x27; Equity Association during the COVID-19 pandemic. This production, which was performed in a tent in the Berkshire Theatre Group&#x27;s parking lot, featured Nicholas Edwards, Tim Jones, Alex Getlin, Michael Wartella, Zach Williams, Dan Rosales, Brandon Lee, Emily Koch, Isabel Jordan, Najah Hetsberger and Kimberly Emmanuel. Instead of the standard opening to the show, which features the song, &quot;Tower of Babble,&quot; the actors of the show shared how their lives were uniquely impacted by the pandemic. The show, which had the audience sitting ten feet away from the actors on stage (who were socially distanced themselves) required that every audience member wear a facial covering for the duration of the performance. This production brought up the possibility of more socially distanced theatrical productions in the future. The show ran from August 6, 2020, until September 20, 2020.

==Adaptations==

===&quot;Godspell, Jr.&quot;===
Part of Music Theatre International&#x27;s Broadway Junior series, &quot;Godspell Junior&quot; is a revised script to be performed by a younger cast. &quot;Godspell Junior&quot; contains much of the first act and very little of the second. In the hour-long one-act show, four songs are cut: &quot;Turn Back, O Man&quot;, &quot;Alas for You&quot;, &quot;By My Side&quot;, and &quot;On the Willows&quot;. &quot;Beautiful City&quot; with updated lyrics is a part of the show, placed at the beginning of the second act, and is immediately followed by the Last Supper, the Betrayal, and the Crucifixion.

===1973 film===
A film version of the musical was released in 1973, set in modern New York and featuring Victor Garber (from the first Canadian cast) as Jesus, David Haskell (from the original cast) as John the Baptist/Judas, and Lynne Thigpen. Tebelak co-wrote the screenplay and served as creative consultant for the film. The song &quot;Beautiful City&quot; was written for and first included in the film. &quot;Prologue: Tower Of Babel&quot; was omitted, and &quot;Learn Your Lessons Well&quot; and &quot;We Beseech Thee&quot; were reduced to minor interludes. Original cast members Robin Lamont, Gilmer McCormick, Joanne Jonas, and Jeffrey Mylett also appear in the film.

==Controversy==
The hippie clothing that the cast wears in the play has caused some controversy. In his &quot;Notes on the Script&quot; (1999), Stephen Schwartz wrote, &quot;There are often misconceptions about the concept of the clown analogy in &quot;Godspell&quot;. For instance, sometimes cast members are thought to be &#x27;hippies&#x27; or &#x27;flower children&#x27;. The concept was derived by John-Michael Tebelak from a book by Harvey Cox, a professor at Harvard Divinity School, entitled &quot;Feast of Fools&quot;.&quot;

There has also been controversy over &quot;Godspell&quot;&#x27;s lack of a resurrection scene. This criticism notably mirrors similar criticism leveled at the 1970 rock opera &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; which also did not depict the resurrection. Rather than be resurrected, Jesus dies in the &quot;Finale&quot;, and the cast is typically directed to lift his body over their heads and walk off through the audience to end the show. Schwartz has made a note of this in the script, saying:

Over the years, there has been comment from some about the lack of an apparent Resurrection in the show. Some choose to view the curtain call, in which JESUS appears, as symbolic of the resurrection; others point to the moment when the cast raise JESUS above their heads. While either view is valid, both miss the point. GODSPELL is about the formation of a community which carries on JESUS&#x27; teachings after he has gone. In other words, it is the effect JESUS has on the OTHERS which is the story of the show, not whether or not he himself is resurrected. Therefore, it is very important at the end of the show that it be clear that the OTHERS have come through the violence and pain of the crucifixion sequence and leave with a joyful determination to carry on the ideas and feelings they have learned during the course of the show.

Though &quot;Godspell&quot; was a successful production, much like &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, that began to break down the barriers between rock and roll and Christianity, it was regarded with suspicion by the mainstream evangelical culture because it disregarded the religious doctrines of resurrection and atonement.

<text>Donald David DeFreeze (November 16, 1943 – May 17, 1974), also known as Cinque Mtume and using the nom de guerre &quot;General Field Marshal Cinque&quot;, was an American man involved with the far-left radical group Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) and convicted criminal.

DeFreeze&#x27;s exact role within the Symbionese Liberation Army is unclear, but analysts have suggested he was either a figurehead or an indirect leader. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, DeFreeze dropped out of high school and had a criminal dossier from the age of fourteen. He received probation in the late 1960s, leading some sources to suggest he was serving as a police informant to the Los Angeles Police Department. 

He and several associates began to make plans for armed action that they believed would rouse the African-American community and attract more recruits. Three SLA soldiers fatally shot Marcus Foster, the superintendent of public schools in Oakland, California, the first African-American superintendent of any major public school system, and wounded his deputy. They mistakenly believed he supported a program of student IDs. Two members of the SLA were arrested in January 1974, convicted and sentenced to prison for the crimes. 

DeFreeze and co-conspirators next kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst in February 1974, seeking a ransom and media attention for their cause. During a shootout with law enforcement in Los Angeles, DeFreeze died by suicide by gunshot when he and five SLA members resisted a police raid in a burning house.

A private investigation before the raid suggested that DeFreeze may have been a police informant and agent provocateur from before the founding days of the SLA. His remains were returned to his native Cleveland, where the funeral was organized at his family&#x27;s request.

==Early life==
DeFreeze was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Louis and Mary DeFreeze; he was the oldest of eight children. His mother was a registered nurse at a convalescent home. His father was a violent man who punished DeFreeze frequently; he broke both of the boy&#x27;s arms three times when he was a child. 

DeFreeze dropped out of school in the ninth grade at age 14 and ran away from home. He moved to Buffalo, New York, where he lived with the Rev. William L. Foster, a fundamentalist minister, and his family. He became a street gang member in Buffalo. The Rev. Foster would say of him later:
He was a get up and go kid... he had a heart that was as big as a house. But some of the boys he used to hang around with, I didn&#x27;t care for. You just knew they were 99 and 44/100 percent bad.

In his first brush with the law, DeFreeze was arrested for stealing from parking meters and stealing a car. He was sent to the state reformatory in Elmira, New York, which later became Elmira Correctional Facility. In 1970, DeFreeze wrote of his time there, which he called a prison or a mental institution:
Life in the prison, as we called it, was nothing, but fear and hate, day in and day out... I would not be part of any of the gangs, black or white... I didn&#x27;t hate anyone, black or white, and they hated me for it.

Following his release, DeFreeze moved to the Newark, New Jersey area. In 1963, at the age of 20, he married Gloria Thomas, who had three children from a previous marriage. DeFreeze and Thomas had a total of three children together. In 1964 his wife had him arrested for desertion. 

They reconciled. After having some gun charges dropped, in 1965 DeFreeze moved with his family from the Northeast to California, where they settled in Los Angeles. He said that the worries of trying to support the children engulfed him. He wrote, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I was slowly becoming a nothing&quot;.

==Prior arrests, warnings and probations==
During his period away from his family, in 1964, police stopped DeFreeze while he was hitchhiking on the San Bernardino Freeway near West Covina, California. They found him carrying a tear-gas pencil bomb, a sharpened butter knife, and a sawed-off rifle in his suitcase.

In 1965, having returned to Newark, DeFreeze was arrested for firing a gun in the basement of his home. &quot;I started playing with guns and fireworks,&quot; he would later write. &quot;Just anything to get away from life and how unhappy I was&quot;. The charges were dropped and DeFreeze took his family to California.

In 1967, the police stopped DeFreeze for running a red light on his bicycle. The police said that when they searched him, they found a homemade bomb in his pocket. The bicycle basket held another bomb and a pistol. DeFreeze said he had found them and was trying to sell them because of his family&#x27;s needs. He was given three years of probation. The probation officer who interviewed DeFreeze wrote that the youth was &quot;deeply troubled by this case&quot;. 

In recommending probation, the officer said:
...The difficulties which the defendant has encountered in his life are real and serious. He feels his responsibilities deeply and is overcome when he cannot meet them. He appears to have a warm relationship with his wife and children... The type of behavior encountered in the present offense appears to be the defendant&#x27;s way of compensating for feelings of inadequacy and powerlessness... The defendant is potentially dangerous if he again encounters such severely threatening circumstances as he was encountering at the time of the offense.

An early probation report described DeFreeze as, &quot;a schizoid personality with strong schizophrenic potential&quot; who had &quot;a fascination with firearms and explosives.&quot; Psychiatric officials at the prison testing center where he was briefly sent recommended that he be jailed &quot;because his fascination with firearms and explosives made him dangerous&quot;. Despite these recommendations, he was given a further five years probation.

In 1969, DeFreeze and an accomplice were arrested in New Jersey for the kidnapping of a caretaker of a synagogue. His accomplice was tried and acquitted. A memorandum from the prosecutor&#x27;s office said that they decided to drop charges against DeFreeze since by the time of trial, he was jailed in California.

On October 11, 1969, Cleveland, Ohio, police spotted DeFreeze on the roof of a bank carrying two pistols and an 8-inch dagger. Police said they found a burglar&#x27;s tool kit and a hand grenade nearby. He paid the $5,000 bond money and then left for Los Angeles.

==Imprisonment and the Black Cultural Association==
On November 17, 1969, DeFreeze was injured in a gun battle with police outside a bank in Los Angeles. He was convicted in 1970 of having stolen a $1,000 negotiable cashier&#x27;s check and was sentenced to 6-to-14 years; he was sent to Vacaville Prison.

While incarcerated at Vacaville Prison, DeFreeze joined the Black Cultural Association (BCA), intended as an educational group to help prepare prisoners for return to general society. He became known as a dynamic member. Started in 1968, the group began to operate at Vacaville in 1969. Colston Westbrook, a grad student and later professor who taught African-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, became involved in recruiting Berkeley students to visit Vacaville as volunteers to BCA. They helped lead educational and political discussions. People from outside the university also attended BCA events, especially related cultural programs. 

Through this organization, DeFreeze met with Willie Wolfe, a white Berkeley student who was taking Westbrook&#x27;s course. Wolfe also persuaded white friends Russ Little and Robyn Steiner to volunteer through the BCA. Wolfe, Little, and DeFreeze are thought to have introduced more political radicalism to the group.

DeFreeze set up a separate small group, called Unisight. He invited radicals Wolfe and Little to join. In addition, inmate Thero Wheeler, a former Black Panther, jailhouse lawyer, and self-taught Marxist, also joined the group. Willie Wolfe has been credited in some accounts as the catalyst for forming the Symbionese Liberation Army.

In December 1972 DeFreeze was transferred to Soledad Prison in Soledad, California for good behavior.

==Escape==

DeFreeze escaped from Soledad Prison on March 5, 1973. He made his way to Oakland, California, where he was hidden by white friends from the Vacaville BCA. He was taken to the house of Patricia &quot;Mizmoon&quot; Soltysik, with whom he lived for several months. Through Soltysik, DeFreeze met Camilla Hall, a white Berkeley artist and former social worker. The two women had an established lesbian relationship, and DeFreeze eventually had relations with each of them. Later he was also sexually involved with SLA member Emily Harris, after she and her husband William decided to have an open marriage.

==SLA==

DeFreeze and Soltysik co-founded the Symbionese Liberation Army, and soon recruited members for the group. DeFreeze adopted the name &quot;General Field Marshal Cinque&quot; (which he pronounced &quot;SINK-you&quot;, though this is not how the name is historically pronounced). He took the name from Joseph Cinqué, a captive Mende who reportedly led the slave rebellion that took over the Spanish slave ship &quot;Amistad&quot; in 1839; the Africans regained their freedom following a United States Supreme Court case. He adopted the surname &quot;Mtume&quot; from the Swahili word for &quot;prophet&quot;. 

By late summer SLA members included Joe Remiro, a Vietnam veteran and activist who was a friend of Little and Wolfe. As DeFreeze&#x27;s circle of acquaintances widened, he also came to know Angela Atwood, 25. She and her husband had moved to the Bay Area from Indiana along with William and Emily Harris. All had moved from Bloomington, where they knew each other at university. The Atwoods separated that year, and Angela lived with the Harrises. 

After acquiring arms, the group perpetrated a number of crimes, the most infamous being the November 1973 murder of Oakland Schools Superintendent Marcus Foster, a black candidate for mayor of the city. DeFreeze was a suspect in the shooting of Foster&#x27;s deputy, Assistant Superintendent Robert Blackburn, who was seriously wounded in the attack. The SLA provoked outrage in the black community by their assassination of Foster, an admired public figure who was the first black superintendent of any major public school system.

In February 1974 they kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in Berkeley. They first sought an exchange and release of political prisoners. When that was refused, they told her to ask her father for a ransom enough to feed the poor people.

On April 15, 1974 they robbed the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco of $10,000. Both Hearst and DeFreeze were captured on security videos that showed them brandishing weapons.

==Informant allegations==
At an earlier probation hearing, defense attorney Morgan M. Morten said that it had been &quot;indicated that [DeFreeze] had been cooperating with the police&quot;.

When Willie Wolfe&#x27;s father, Dr. Wolfe, learned of his son&#x27;s involvement in the SLA, he hired private detective Lake Headley, to provide him with more information. On May 4, 1974, thirteen days before the younger Wolfe&#x27;s death with DeFreeze and others in a shootout and fire, Headley and freelance writer Donald Freed held a press conference in San Francisco. They presented 400 pages of documentation of their findings, some of which included evidence that, a year before the kidnapping, Patty Hearst had visited DeFreeze in prison. 

Lake Headley also provided evidence for the following:

===DeFreeze&#x27;s arrest records===
Records showed that DeFreeze had set up the arrest of an associate in a case involving a stolen gun. The Los Angeles Police Department officer who handled the case became a key intelligence officer who handled informants related to black militants.

According to Headley&#x27;s research, police records showed that between 1967 and 1969, DeFreeze was given probation despite a series of adverse encounters with the police, which related to charges for illegal possession of weapons and explosives. These included arrest for possession of weapons, a kidnapping charge in New Jersey, an attempted bank robbery in Cleveland, and a gunfight with Los Angeles police and bank guards.

On March 10, 1968, DeFreeze was charged with burglary in Inglewood, California. There was no disposition of the charges. On August 16, 1968, he was charged with stealing a motorcycle. There was no disposition. His probation was modified, on December 13, 1968, to forbid possession of firearms or bombs. On March 20, 1969, he was picked up with a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic rifle with 32 rounds in the magazine. There was no disposition.

===BCA contact worked with LAPD unit targeting radicals/DeFreeze a possible LAPD informant===
Evidence showed that Colston Westbrook, a professor and the BCA&#x27;s main contact at UC Berkeley, had worked closely with the Los Angeles Police Department&#x27;s Criminal Conspiracy Section (CCS) and the State of California&#x27;s Sacramento-based CII (Criminal Identification and Investigation) unit. This was during the same period when DeFreeze was receiving unusually lenient treatment and extended probation from the Los Angeles County criminal justice system. Headley suggested this implied that DeFreeze was working as an informant.

On May 17, 1974, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran the story about Dr. Wolfe&#x27;s investigation and Headley&#x27;s report with some of this information. But the major story that day was the LAPD shootout at the SLA house, which was engulfed by an accidental fire. DeFreeze was found to have committed suicide by gunshot; two SLA members were fatally shot by police when they left the house; two others died of smoke and fire. 

Investigator Lake Headley presented additional evidence that Donald DeFreeze was a police informant and an agent provocateur in his book &quot;Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America&#x27;s Greatest Detective&quot; (1993), co-written with freelance writer William Hoffman. He also concluded that the Black Cultural Association was used by law enforcement to monitor radicals among both Berkeley students and prison inmates. Upon meeting radicals after his prison escape, DeFreeze was known for his eagerness to sell them firearms, explosives, and related items. Some of his contacts were suspicious that he was trying to set up sting operations. His means of acquiring weaponry has remained unexplained.

===CIA assassination squad theories=== 

Headley&#x27;s work has been interpreted to suggest that the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was a CIA-controlled assassination squad, with the Black Panther Party as its main target. The theory states that the SLA originated within California prisons and was actively recruited by authorities. It also claims that the assassination of Oakland Schools Superintendent Marcus Foster was approved by the squad&#x27;s handlers, and that the squad was eliminated in the 1974 Los Angeles shootout because their operation security had been compromised.

==Death==

On May 17, 1974, the Los Angeles Police Department tracked DeFreeze and five other SLA members to a house at 1466 East 54th Street; they surrounded it and demanded that occupants surrender. An elderly man and a child were allowed out of the house. Following that, police fired a tear gas canister through a window, which the SLA answered with bursts of automatic weapons fire. During the shootout the police were outgunned by the SLA&#x27;s automatic weapons, and the SLA&#x27;s gas masks rendered the tear gas ineffective. But the house caught fire during the shootout, possibly from an outdoor-type combusting tear gas canister. 

DeFreeze and five others made their way into a crawlspace beneath the house, where they continued to fire at police. A canister exploded and the house caught fire. As it burned, Nancy Ling Perry and Camilla Hall left the house, brandishing pistols according to police, and were fatally shot. DeFreeze was found to have committed suicide by shooting himself in the right side of his head with a pistol before succumbing to the fire. Angela Atwood and Patricia Soltysik, still in the crawlspace, may have died of smoke inhalation before the flames reached them.

==Funeral and burial==
DeFreeze&#x27;s body was returned to family in Cleveland. They asked members of the Sunni Muslim sect to organize and conduct the funeral, which was held in the chapel of a funeral home. Some 500 attended, with another 1500 persons gathered outside. His younger brother Delano DeFreeze said that his brother had &quot;lived for the people&quot; and &quot;died for the people&quot;. The family had appealed to revolutionaries to come to the funeral, but none were observed there. 

DeFreeze was buried in Highland Park Cemetery in Highland Hills, Ohio. 

==References in media==
Stephen King said in notes to his book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981), that DeFreeze was one of the inspirations for his recurring character Randall Flagg:

I sat there for another fifteen minutes or so, listening to the Eagles on my little cassette player, and then I wrote: Donald DeFreeze is a dark man.&quot; He first referred to him in his book &quot;The Stand&quot;.

DeFreeze is mentioned in King&#x27;s post-apocalyptic novel &quot;The Stand&quot; as an acquaintance of Randall Flagg, the book&#x27;s main antagonist; it is implied that Flagg was involved in Hearst&#x27;s kidnapping.

DeFreeze and the SLA are referred to in the 1976 film &quot;Network&quot;. A television show is purportedly created that uses members of a fictional version of the SLA as the stars.

Paul Schrader&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Patty Hearst&quot; features DeFreeze played by Ving Rhames.

The Camper Van Beethoven song &quot;Tania&quot; from &quot;Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart&quot; refers to DeFreeze by his nom de guerre &quot;Field Marshal Cinque&quot; in the lyrics &quot;A Polaroid of you, Cinque/With a seven-headed dragon/In a house in Daly City&quot;.

DeFreeze and the SLA are discussed in David Talbot&#x27;s 2012 book about San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;&quot;, which treats as credible the theory that DeFreeze was secretly working with the authorities.

<doc id="321254" wikidata="Q495877" url="?curid=321254" title="President of Slovenia">
<text>The president of Slovenia, officially the president of the Republic of Slovenia (), is the head of state of Slovenia. The office was established on 23 December 1991 when the National Assembly passed a new constitution after the separation of Slovenia from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Five individuals have occupied the post of president of the Republic since Slovenia achieved its independence. The incumbent is Nataša Pirc Musar, Slovenia&#x27;s first female president. The president&#x27;s official workplace is the Presidential Palace in Ljubljana.

==Election and term of office==
The president is directly elected by universal adult suffrage for a term of five years. Any Slovenian citizen of legal age (18 or more) may run for President, but may only hold office for two terms.

The president has no legally guaranteed immunity and may be impeached during their time in office.

==Duties and functions==
The president of the Republic is the highest representative of the Slovenian state, belonging neither to the legislative, executive, judicial, nor constitutive branches of state power. The president instead occupies a completely separate but coequal moderating branch by virtue of Article 102 of the Constitution. To this end, the president represents Slovenia abroad, fosters national unity at home, and exercises supreme command and control over the Armed Forces of Slovenia as commander-in-chief. In the performance of these functions, the president upholds the rule of law and, through their ongoing mediation and arbitration, guarantees the continuity and orderly operation of Slovenia’s democratic institutions. This stabilising and integrative role is in keeping with the president’s solemn oath taken at inauguration to “...uphold the constitutional order,…act according to my conscience and…do all in my power for the good of Slovenia”.

The Constitution of Slovenia provides for a parliamentary system of government, whereby the presidency is a predominantly ceremonial institution with limited political power. Indeed, unlike in most parliamentary republics, the president is not even the ‘’nominal’’ chief executive. Rather, the executive authority of Slovenia is implicitly vested in the Government with the prime minister as its head. The Government is nevertheless obliged by the terms of its own standing orders to keep the president fully informed on matters of state, be they foreign or domestic. Moreover, the functions conferred on the president by the Constitution and subordinate statute law require neither the countersignature of the prime minister nor the advice of the Government to be effective. Thus, the powers and duties at the president’s disposal are generally exercised either in his or her complete discretion, after consultation with or on the proposal of the Government (with the right to refuse a proposal and to act contrary to any advice tendered), or in accordance with constitutional restrictions in the case of certain ministerial functions.

===Legislative functions===
;Convene regular sessions of the National Assembly: The president of the Republic has the power to call both general and by-elections to the National Assembly and to convene its first regular session following a general election, provided general elections must be called no later than fifteen days before the expiry of four years from the date of the first session of the outgoing National Assembly. Likewise, if the president dissolves the National Assembly before the expiration of its mandate and calls for snap elections, a new National Assembly must be elected no later than two months after the dissolution of the previous one. The term of the old National Assembly otherwise comes to an end by default upon the first session of a new National Assembly, which must be convoked by the president no later than twenty days after a general election.

;Convene extraordinary sessions of the National Assembly: The president of the Republic may convene an extraordinary session of the National Assembly. The calling together of an extraordinary session of the National Assembly concurrently reconvenes the National Council, the upper house of Slovenia’s incompletely bicameral Parliament.

;Dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections: The president has plenary authority to dissolve the National Assembly before the expiration of its term and call snap elections, but only if either of the following conditions are met:
#The National Assembly fails to elect a prime minister within 30 days from the start of a new parliamentary session; or
#The National Assembly passes a vote of no confidence in the Government and fails to elect a new prime minister within 30 days.

;Express opinions to the National Assembly: The president of the Republic may, on their own initiative or whenever requested by the National Assembly, express an opinion on any matter of national import.

;Promulgate laws: The president of the Republic promulgates each law passed by the National Assembly within eight days of its enactment, unless the law is sooner vetoed by the National Council. The president does not have the discretion to refuse laws duly passed by the National Assembly and agreed to by the National Council.

===Executive functions===
;Nominate the prime minister: The president of the Republic nominates for the consideration of the National Assembly a candidate for prime minister, after consultation with the leaders of the various political parties represented in the National Assembly. The National Assembly in turn elects or rejects the president’s nominee. If the National Assembly fails to elect a prime minister on the first round, the president may nominate one or more additional candidates for the consideration of the National Assembly in subsequent rounds, including a previously nominated candidate. This process continues until a prime minister is duly elected or the National Assembly is dissolved.

;Nominate and appoint certain other state officials: The president of the Republic nominates for the consideration of the National Assembly the governor of the Central Bank of Slovenia, the members of the Court of Audit, and the Human Rights Ombudsman. The National Assembly in turn confirms or rejects the candidates so nominated. If confirmed, the nominees are formally appointed to office by the president.

;Represent Slovenia in foreign relations: The president of the Republic acts as Slovenia&#x27;s supreme representative in international affairs. In this capacity, the president appoints and recalls Slovenian ambassadors and envoys, accepts the credentials of foreign diplomats accredited to Slovenia, and both pays and receives state visits. Pursuant to Articles 14 and 59 of the Foreign Affairs Act, the president also decides on the opening and closure of diplomatic missions. In the performance of these duties, the president is required by law to consult the foreign minister in order to ensure a coordinated and effective foreign policy. The president is nevertheless not obliged to follow any of the foreign minister&#x27;s opinions, proposals, requests, or recommendations. Indeed, the president may act contrary to such advice. In a similar vein, the president is empowered to issue instruments of ratification, whereby Slovenia expresses its consent as a sovereign state to be bound by treaty under international law. Despite this authority, the president&#x27;s ability to refuse a treaty is limited. Treaty negotiation and conclusion is the responsibility of the Government, whereas ratification itself rests exclusively with the National Assembly. Nevertheless, before affixing his or her instrument of ratification to any treaty, the president may request the Constitutional Court to opine on the treaty&#x27;s constitutionality. If the Constitutional Court concludes the treaty violates the Constitution, the treaty is deemed null and void. If the Constitutional Court finds the treaty is however in compliance with the Constitution, the president must issue an instrument of ratification.

;Serve as Commander-in-Chief: Supreme command and control of the Slovenian Armed Forces vests in the president of the Republic as commander-in-chief. To this end, the president has plenary authority to declare a state of emergency and to declare a state of war if Slovenia is under attack. However, the president may exercise these broad powers only if the National Assembly is for whatever reason unable to convene. Other duties have been conferred on the president by virtue of Slovenia&#x27;s Defense Act. For example, the president:
#commissions all generals, admirals, and other commissioned officers of the Armed Forces;
#approves the annual guidelines prepared by the defense minister and submitted to the chief of the General Staff detailing the operational strategy, materiel needs, and organizational plans of the Armed Forces;
#prescribes the conditions and procedures for keeping him or herself informed about the state of readiness of the Armed Forces and other matters relevant to the defence of the state;
#receives regular briefings from the Intelligence and Security Service;
#adopts regulations with the force of law for the purpose of administering the activities of the Armed Forces, including matters of military justice, but only on the proposal of the Government;
#orders the mobilisation of the Armed Forces, but only on the proposal of the Government; and
#decides upon the use and deployment of the Armed Forces, the enforcement of work and material duty, and (during a state of emergency) their total mobilisation.

;Issue decrees in times of national crisis: The president of the Republic may, at the request of the Government, issue decrees with the force of law. Said decrees may, in exception, restrict individual human rights and fundamental freedoms otherwise guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution. The president’s authority to make such decrees is only valid when the National Assembly is unable to convene and a state of war or emergency has been invoked. The president may accept or refuse the Government’s request.

===Judicial functions===
;Exercise the prerogative of clemency: The president of the Republic may, in their discretion, grant general or special pardons, commutations, reprieves, and respites to individuals convicted of criminal violations in Slovenian courts. The president may choose to appoint a commission of experts to consult him or herself in the review of applications, but the prerogative of clemency is ultimately the president&#x27;s alone.

;Nominate justices of the Constitutional Court: The president of the Republic nominates for the consideration of the National Assembly the nine justices of the Constitutional Court, who each serve staggered nonrenewable terms of nine years. The National Assembly in turn elects or rejects the candidates so nominated.

;Nominate members of the Judicial Council: The president of the Republic nominates for the consideration of the National Assembly five out of the eleven members of the Judicial Council. Nominees must be university professors of law, senior counsel, or attorneys accepted to the State Bar. The National Assembly in turn elects or rejects the candidates so nominated. Members of the Judicial Council serve staggered terms of six years upon confirmation, with either two or three of the presidentially nominated members subject to reelection every three years.

;Nominate Slovenian judges to international courts: The president of the Republic nominates for the consideration of the National Assembly Slovenia&#x27;s judges on the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, and the International Criminal Court. The National Assembly in turn elects or rejects the candidates so nominated.

;Confer and revoke state honours: The president of the Republic is Slovenia&#x27;s fount of honour. In this capacity, the president confers state honours on individuals for contributions to civil society, diplomacy and international affairs, and national security. Pursuant to the Act on Decorations of the Republic of Slovenia, state honours take the form of various medals and national orders, are conferred and revoked by decree, and are awarded at the president&#x27;s discretion. Nevertheless, state authorities, local government authorities, organizations and citizens of the Republic of Slovenia may propose candidates for the president&#x27;s consideration. Likewise, a Slovenian citizen cannot accept a foreign honour without the president&#x27;s consent.

<text>Ronald Radosh ( ; born 1937) is an American social conservative writer, professor, historian, and former Marxist. As he described in his memoirs, Radosh was, like his Ashkenazi Jewish parents, a member of the Communist Party USA until the exposure of the truth about Stalinism began during the Khrushchev Thaw. He later became an activist in the New Left against the Vietnam War.

Radosh turned his attention in the late 1970s to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, whom he had believed for decades to have been the innocent victims of judicial murder by a kangaroo court. After studying declassified FBI documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and interviewing their friends and associates, Radosh came to the conclusion that the Rosenbergs had in fact committed espionage for the Soviet KGB during the Manhattan Project and the Korean War, the crime for which they were both executed. When Radosh published his conclusions, despite what he considered to be his efforts to be balanced and objective, the American New Left was outraged.

Radosh describes his subsequent experience, which he termed at the time &quot;Left-Wing McCarthyism&quot;, as the moment when his political views began to shift towards neoconservatism, and states that his subsequent research as a historian has continued to make him very critical of both Marxism and Communism. Currently employed by the Hudson Institute, Radosh has also published an expose about the covert activities of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s NKVD and the Red Terror during the Spanish Civil War.

His most recent book, about the foundation of the State of Israel, was co-authored with his second wife, Allis Radosh: &quot;A Safe Haven: Harry S. Truman and the Founding of Israel&quot; was published by HarperCollins in 2009. The Radoshes are currently writing a book about the presidency of Warren G. Harding, to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==Early life==
Radosh was born in the Lower East Side of Manhattan and raised in Washington Heights. His parents, Reuben Radosh and Ida Kreichman, were Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. A self-described red diaper baby who was, &quot;born on the First of May&quot;, Radosh has stated that his earliest memory is of being taken to a May Day parade in Union Square. His maternal uncle, Irving Keith (formerly Irving Kreichman), had trained at the International Lenin School in Moscow and then travelled to the Second Spanish Republic to fight as a Commissar in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Irving Keith, who was killed in action during the spring 1938 retreat, was revered as an anti-fascist martyr by the Radosh family and his nephew grew up regularly re-reading his letters. It was only decades later that Radosh became very critical of his uncle&#x27;s many written defenses of the ongoing Red Terror by the Servicio de Información Militar throughout the Spanish Republican Army, by simply repeating the conspiracy theory that all members of the anti-Stalinist Left were a crypto-fascist &quot;rearguard&quot; who sought to &quot;create divisions in the Popular Front&quot;.

In the 1940s and the 1950s, Radosh attended the Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, both of which were private schools for children from the Communist Party USA families. He also attended the communist-run Camp Woodland for Children in the Catskill Mountains. His memoirs vividly describe school-day encounters with Mary Travers, Woody Guthrie, and Peter Seeger. Like almost everyone else he knew, Radosh was involved in protesting against American involvement in the Korean War and also believed in William A. Reuben&#x27;s &quot;first conspiracy theory ... that the U.S. Government had framed the Rosenbergs and forced the key government witness, Harry Gold, to lie on the witness stand&quot;.

On June 19, 1953, Radosh joined Howard Fast and Civil Rights Congress leader William L. Patterson in a mass demonstration in Union Square against the imminent execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. When Fast announced that the Rosenbergs were being led into the execution chamber, Radosh recalls that a wail went through the crowd and the Party&#x27;s folk singers began singing, &quot;Go Down Moses&quot;. The following morning, Radosh attended the Rosenbergs&#x27; subsequent secular funeral in full Labor Youth League regalia. He later recalled, &quot;That moment would remain etched in my memory, forever the symbol of what awaited good, progressive Jews who dared to stand up for their beliefs. It would take almost forty years for me to face up to the real meaning of the Rosenberg case for America.&quot;

==University education==
Radosh began attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the fall of 1955. He has said that his desire at the time was both to study history, which Karl Marx considered queen of the sciences, and to become a leader of America&#x27;s communists. Despite being raised to always defend the actions of the Soviet Union, Radosh developed a close friendship with Professor George Mosse, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany and member of the anti-Stalinist Left, which Radosh had been raised to detest. In 1959, Radosh arrived at the University of Iowa and intended to work towards his master&#x27;s degree. While Iowa City, &quot;boasted one small, dilapidated movie theatre, many bars, [and] few restaurants&quot;, in Radosh&#x27;s own words, &quot;the town also had its bohemian and political fringe&quot;. For example, there was already one off-campus &quot;Greenwich Village-style coffee shop&quot; where Radosh regularly met to play folk music with Robert Mezey, Sol Stern, and other fellow radicals with whom he helped found the &quot;Iowa Socialist Discussion Club.&quot;

In September 1961, the Radosh family returned to Madison. Radosh had received his masters as a historian, and began working towards his doctorate under William Appleman Williams, one of the founders of the Wisconsin School of diplomatic history, who further drew his young protege into the New Left. Meanwhile, Ronald and Alice Radosh twice hosted, at their studio apartment along State Street in Madison, a young and unknown guitar playing folk singer, who deliberately dressed like and emulated Woody Guthrie and whose name was Bob Dylan. Dylan once told Radosh, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be as big a star as Elvis Presley ... I&#x27;ll play the same and even bigger arenas. I know it.&quot; Radosh and Dylan performed together at &quot;regular, impromptu hootenanny sessions in a small new cafe on State Street, a place modeled after Greenwich Village hangouts&quot;. Radosh later recalled, &quot;In the years to come, I often wished someone had been running a tape recorder at these regular sessions.&quot;

Despite being raised as a red diaper baby by fellow travelers, Radosh&#x27;s growing fondness during the early 1960s for the writings of Trotskyist historian Isaac Deutscher enraged senior members of the American Communist Party in Madison. According to Radosh, Deutscher&#x27;s writings told the truth about Stalinism and the Great Purge, without completely rejecting Marxist-Leninism or the October Revolution. The American Communist Party in Madison&#x27;s attempts to coerce and intimidate Radosh back into the party line backfired and instead became the major factor in his departure. The last straw came when &quot;the party sent it&#x27;s top youth organizer, Danny Rubin, to stay with us&quot;. Upon seeing multiple Deutscher&#x27;s books on Radosh&#x27;s bookshelf, Rubin &quot;threw a fit&quot;, and screamed, &quot;As a good Communist, you cannot read this junk! Get rid of it!&quot; Rubin then pulled out a copy of &quot;World Marxist Review&quot; and screamed, &quot;This is what you &quot;should&quot; be reading, not Trotskyite junk!&quot; Despite still being a senior leader of Madison&#x27;s Labor Youth League, Radosh broke with the Soviet-backed Communist Party USA and continued to become a founding father of the American New Left.
==Vietnam War==
In 1963, Radosh returned to New York City with his wife and children. After teaching at two community colleges in Brooklyn, Radosh joined the New York chapter of the Committee to Stop the War in Vietnam. He recalled:
When Norman Thomas died in 1968, I wrote what may have been the only published negative assessment of his life. Most obituaries heralded Thomas as the nation&#x27;s conscience, a man of principle who had turned out to be right about a great deal. Of course, Thomas was against the war in Vietnam; he had made a famous speech in which he said he came not to burn the American flag but to cleanse it. But for radicals like myself, that proved that he was a sellout. His opposition to the war was so tame, I argued, that he actually helped the American ruling class. I claimed that Thomas&#x27; opposition to LBJ&#x27;s bombing campaign was only a &quot;tactical&quot; difference with the President. Thomas&#x27; chief sin, in my view, was to have written that he did not, &quot;regard Vietcong terrorism as virtuous&quot;. He was guilty of attacking the heroic Vietnamese people, instead of the United States, which was the enemy of the world&#x27;s people. My final judgment was that Thomas had &quot;accepted the Cold War, its ideology and ethics and had decided to enlist in fighting its battles&quot; on the wrong—the anti-communist—side.

Soon afterward, Radosh joined the New York chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. In his book &quot;Prophets on the Right&quot;, completed in 1974, Radosh referred to himself as both &quot;an advocate of a socialist solution to America&#x27;s domestic crisis&quot; and &quot;a radical historian.&quot; The book profiles several historical conservative or far-right isolationists, &quot;critics of American globalism&quot;, men who were &quot;outside the consensus, or the mainstream ... [and] regarded as subversive of the existing order.&quot; Radosh&#x27;s stated aim in writing the book was to &quot;move us... to think carefully about alternative possibilities&quot; to &quot;our current predicament,&quot; which was a clear reference to the ongoing Vietnam War. In 1976, Radosh was a &quot;founding sponsor&quot; of James Weinstein&#x27;s magazine &quot;In These Times&quot;.

==Second thoughts==
While researching his 1978 article &quot;The Rosenberg File&quot; and expanding it into a 1983 book of the same name, Radosh was forced to conclude that Julius Rosenberg had been guilty of both treason and espionage, and that Ethel was aware of his activities. At the same time, Radosh and his two respective coauthors also exposed and condemned multiple acts of prosecutorial misconduct during the trial by Assistant U.S. Attorney Roy Cohn. Radosh similarly condemned multiple violations of the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights during the era of McCarthyism. Radosh also learned that the U.S. Department of Justice had gone for the death penalty at the trial of the Rosenbergs only because they wanted Julius Rosenberg to cooperate with investigators and testify as a prosecution witness against other, even more damaging Soviet spies. The Rosenbergs&#x27; refusal of all offers to cooperate in return for a more lenient sentence was accordingly a great disappointment to both federal prosecutors and to the U.S. Intelligence Community.

Despite his claims of being unbiased and evenhanded as a historian, Radosh found himself subjected to both ostracism and character assassination by the American New Left in an effort to discredit the conclusions in his book. One friend told him, &quot;The facts are irrelevant, we need the Rosenbergs as heroes.&quot; As a result of their 1983 book and the subsequent revelations in the Vassiliev papers as well as decrypted Soviet intelligence communications from the era through the Venona project, a consensus has emerged that rather than having been framed by the FBI, both of the Rosenbergs &quot;had&quot; in fact been very valuable NKVD spies, and that Julius Rosenberg was both the handler and agent recruiter whose active network of moles and couriers stole highly significant military and nuclear secrets for the Soviet Union during both World War II and the Korean War. A second edition of &quot;The Rosenberg File&quot; was published by Yale University Press in 1997 and incorporated newly obtained evidence, which further proved the Rosenberg&#x27;s guilt, that Radosh obtained from the former KGB archives after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Radosh&#x27;s memoirs, published in 2001 as &quot;Commies: A Journey Through the Old Left, the New Left, and the Leftover Left&quot;, discussed the various reasons for his disillusionment with Marxist solutions and embrace of American patriotism and social conservatism, including the vicious blacklash over his exposure of the Rosenbergs and learning of both widespread human rights abuses and the abuse of psychiatry by Fidel Castro, and his fellow tourists&#x27; efforts to excuse those abuses, during a mid-1970s trip to Cuba. According to Radosh, the last straw came when he visited refugee camps in Central America during the 1980s and listened to what he described as horrifying accounts of the tyranny experienced by the many Nicaraguan people who had fled from the Sandinistas.

The Rosenberg&#x27;s co-defendant Morton Sobell&#x27;s 2008 interview with Sam Roberts of &quot;The New York Times&quot; had him admit his own guilt and that of Julius Rosenberg after years of proclaiming his innocence, which further vindicated Radosh&#x27;s once controversial thesis in &quot;The Rosenberg File&quot;. A year later, Radosh and Steven Usdin also interviewed Sobell. Writing in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, Radosh outlined the dimensions of the classified material that Sobell had passed to the Soviet KGB as part of the Rosenberg spy ring.

Radosh&#x27;s writings have appeared in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, the blog &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;, and many other newspapers and magazines. He was a faculty member at Queensborough Community College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Radosh is now an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., and a professor emeritus of history at the City University of New York (CUNY).

==Family==
Radosh married Alice Schweig in the summer of 1959. He recalls, &quot;Our wedding was on Labor Day weekend, and after the ceremony we drove into New York to spend one night in town. We celebrated our wedding by watching the annual proletarian Labor Day parade that still marched through downtown New York.&quot; They separated in 1969 and later divorced. In October 1975, Radosh married Allis Rosenberg, who has a PhD in American History and has co-authored two books with him. The couple reside in Silver Spring, Maryland.

==Controversy==
On 7 August 2014, Radosh reviewed Diana West&#x27;s &quot;American Betrayal&quot; in &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;. West had alleged that infiltration of the United States federal government by Stalinist moles and fellow travelers had significantly altered Western Allies and policies during World War II to favor the Soviet Union. Radosh criticized West&#x27;s limited knowledge of the scholarly literature and called her thesis a &quot;yellow journalism conspiracy theory&quot;. West published a follow-up book focusing on the attack on her by Radosh and others. The journal &quot;The New Criterion&quot; had a full-fledged dialogue about the issues that arose because of his critique of West.

<doc id="321263" wikidata="Q727096" url="?curid=321263" title="Birth defect">
<text>A birth defect is an abnormal condition that is present at birth, regardless of its cause. Birth defects may result in disabilities that may be physical, intellectual, or developmental. The disabilities can range from mild to severe. Birth defects are divided into two main types: structural disorders in which problems are seen with the shape of a body part and functional disorders in which problems exist with how a body part works. Functional disorders include metabolic and degenerative disorders. Some birth defects include both structural and functional disorders.
Birth defects may result from genetic or chromosomal disorders, exposure to certain medications or chemicals, or certain infections during pregnancy. Risk factors include folate deficiency, drinking alcohol or smoking during pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and a mother over the age of 35 years old. Many birth defects are believed to involve multiple factors. Birth defects may be visible at birth or diagnosed by screening tests. A number of defects can be detected before birth by different prenatal tests.
Treatment varies depending on the defect in question. This may include therapy, medication, surgery, or assistive technology. Birth defects affected about 96 million people . In the United States, they occur in about 3% of newborns. They resulted in about 628,000 deaths in 2015, down from 751,000 in 1990. The types with the greatest numbers of deaths are congenital heart disease (303,000), followed by neural tube defects (65,000).
== Classification ==
Much of the language used for describing congenital conditions antedates genome mapping, and structural conditions are often considered separately from other congenital conditions. Many metabolic conditions are now known to have subtle structural expression, and structural conditions often have genetic links. Still, congenital conditions are often classified on a structural basis, organized when possible by primary organ system affected.

=== Primarily structural ===
Several terms are used to describe congenital abnormalities. (Some of these are also used to describe noncongenital conditions, and more than one term may apply in an individual condition.)

==== Terminology ====
* A congenital physical anomaly is an abnormality of the structure of a body part. It may or may not be perceived as a problem condition. Many, if not most, people have one or more minor physical anomalies if examined carefully. Examples of minor anomalies can include curvature of the fifth finger (clinodactyly), a third nipple, tiny indentations of the skin near the ears (preauricular pits), shortness of the fourth metacarpal or metatarsal bones, or dimples over the lower spine (sacral dimples). Some minor anomalies may be clues to more significant internal abnormalities.
* Birth defect is a widely used term for a congenital malformation, &quot;i.e.&quot; a congenital, physical anomaly that is recognizable at birth, and which is significant enough to be considered a problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most birth defects are believed to be caused by a complex mix of factors including genetics, environment, and behaviors, though many birth defects have no known cause. An example of a birth defect is cleft palate, which occurs during the fourth through seventh weeks of gestation. Body tissue and special cells from each side of the head grow toward the center of the face. They join to make the face. A cleft means a split or separation; the &quot;roof&quot; of the mouth is called the palate.
* A congenital malformation is a physical anomaly that is deleterious, &quot;i.e.&quot; a structural defect perceived as a problem. A typical combination of malformations affecting more than one body part is referred to as a malformation syndrome.
* Some conditions are due to abnormal tissue development:
** A malformation is associated with a disorder of tissue development. Malformations often occur in the first trimester.
** A dysplasia is a disorder at the organ level that is due to problems with tissue development.
* Conditions also can arise after tissue is formed:
** A deformation is a condition arising from mechanical stress to normal tissue. Deformations often occur in the second or third trimester, and can be due to oligohydramnios.
** A disruption involves breakdown of normal tissues.
* When multiple effects occur in a specified order, they are known as a sequence. When the order is not known, it is a syndrome.

==== Examples of primarily structural congenital disorders ====
A limb anomaly is called a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, ectrodactyly, phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, congenital aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.

Congenital heart defects include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot.

Congenital anomalies of the nervous system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, encephalocele, and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies of the nervous system include the Arnold–Chiari malformation, the Dandy–Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.

Congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal system include numerous forms of stenosis and atresia, and perforation, such as gastroschisis.

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract include renal parenchyma, kidneys, and urinary collecting system.

Defects can be bilateral or unilateral, and different defects often coexist in an individual child.

=== Primarily metabolic ===

A congenital metabolic disease is also referred to as an inborn error of metabolism. Most of these are single-gene defects, usually heritable. Many affect the structure of body parts, but some simply affect the function.

=== Other ===
Other well-defined genetic conditions may affect the production of hormones, receptors, structural proteins, and ion channels.

== Causes ==

=== Alcohol exposure ===
The mother&#x27;s consumption of alcohol during pregnancy can cause a continuum of various permanent birth defects: craniofacial abnormalities, brain damage, intellectual disability, heart disease, kidney abnormality, skeletal anomalies, ocular abnormalities.

The prevalence of children affected is estimated at least 1% in U.S. as well in Canada.

Very few studies have investigated the links between paternal alcohol use and offspring health.

However, recent animal research has shown a correlation between paternal alcohol exposure and decreased offspring birth weight. Behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, and lowered stress tolerance have been linked to paternal alcohol ingestion. The compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses to stress that children with fetal alcohol syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use. These birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects at birth.

=== Toxic substances ===
Substances whose toxicity can cause congenital disorders are called teratogens, and include certain pharmaceutical and recreational drugs in pregnancy, as well as many environmental toxins in pregnancy.

A review published in 2010 identified six main teratogenic mechanisms associated with medication use: folate antagonism, neural crest cell disruption, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, vascular disruption, and specific receptor- or enzyme-mediated teratogenesis.

An estimated 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and occupational exposures. Paternal smoking has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a woman can also be exposed to teratogens from contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency studied 1,065 chemical and drug substances in their ToxCast program (part of the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard) using &quot;in silico&quot; modeling and a human pluripotent stem cell-based assay to predict in vivo developmental intoxicants based on changes in cellular metabolism following chemical exposure. Findings of the study published in 2020 were that 19% of the 1065 chemicals yielded a prediction of developmental toxicity.

==== Medications and supplements ====
Probably, the most well-known teratogenic drug is thalidomide. It was developed near the end of the 1950s by Chemie Grünenthal as a sleep-inducing aid and antiemetic. Because of its ability to prevent nausea, it was prescribed for pregnant women in almost 50 countries worldwide between 1956 and 1962. Until William McBride published the study leading to its withdrawal from the market in 1961, about 8,000 to 10,000 severely malformed children were born. The most typical disorders induced by thalidomide were reductional deformities of the long bones of the extremities. Phocomelia, otherwise a rare deformity, therefore helped to recognise the teratogenic effect of the new drug. Among other malformations caused by thalidomide were those of ears, eyes, brain, kidney, heart, and digestive and respiratory tracts; 40% of the prenatally affected children died soon after birth. As thalidomide is used today as a treatment for multiple myeloma and leprosy, several births of affected children were described in spite of the strictly required use of contraception among female patients treated by it.

Vitamin A is the sole vitamin that is embryotoxic even in a therapeutic dose, for example in multivitamins, because its metabolite, retinoic acid, plays an important role as a signal molecule in the development of several tissues and organs. Its natural precursor, β-carotene, is considered safe, whereas the consumption of animal liver can lead to malformation, as the liver stores lipophilic vitamins, including retinol. Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic-acid; brand name Roaccutane), vitamin A analog, which is often used to treat severe acne, is such a strong teratogen that just a single dose taken by a pregnant woman (even transdermally) may result in serious birth defects. Because of this effect, most countries have systems in place to ensure that it is not given to pregnant women and that the patient is aware of how important it is to prevent pregnancy during and at least one month after treatment. Medical guidelines also suggest that pregnant women should limit vitamin A intake to about 700 μg/day, as it has teratogenic potential when consumed in excess. Vitamin A and similar substances can induce spontaneous abortions, premature births, defects of eyes (microphthalmia), ears, thymus, face deformities, and neurological (hydrocephalus, microcephalia) and cardiovascular defects, as well as intellectual disability.

Tetracycline, an antibiotic, should never be prescribed to women of reproductive age or to children, because of its negative impact on bone mineralization and teeth mineralization. The &quot;tetracycline teeth&quot; have brown or grey colour as a result of a defective development of both the dentine and the enamel of teeth.

Several anticonvulsants are known to be highly teratogenic. Phenytoin, also known as diphenylhydantoin, along with carbamazepine, is responsible for the fetal hydantoin syndrome, which may typically include broad nose base, cleft lip and/or palate, microcephalia, nails and fingers hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction, and intellectual disability. Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal, and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has antifolate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as spina bifida. Lower IQ and autism have recently also been reported as a result of intrauterine valproate exposure.

Hormonal contraception is considered harmless for the embryo. Peterka and Novotná do, however, state that synthetic progestins used to prevent miscarriage in the past frequently caused masculinization of the outer reproductive organs of female newborns due to their androgenic activity. Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic estrogen used from the 1940s to 1971, when the prenatal exposition has been linked to the clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. Following studies showed elevated risks for other tumors and congenital malformations of the sex organs for both sexes.

All cytostatics are strong teratogens; abortion is usually recommended when pregnancy is discovered during or before chemotherapy. Aminopterin, a cytostatic drug with antifolate effect, was used during the 1950s and 1960s to induce therapeutic abortions. In some cases, the abortion did not happen, but the newborns had a fetal aminopterin syndrome consisting of growth retardation, craniosynostosis, hydrocephalus, facial dismorphities, intellectual disability, or leg deformities

==== Toxic substances ====
Drinking water is often a medium through which harmful toxins travel. Heavy metals, elements, nitrates, nitrites, and fluoride can be carried through water and cause congenital disorders.

Nitrate, which is found mostly in drinking water from ground sources, is a powerful teratogen. A case-control study in rural Australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and congenital malformations found that those who drank the nitrate-containing groundwater, as opposed to rain water, ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal defects, and cardiac defects.

Chlorinated and aromatic solvents such as benzene and trichloroethylene sometimes enter the water supply due to oversights in waste disposal. A case-control study on the area found that by 1986, leukemia was occurring in the children of Woburn, Massachusetts, at a rate that was four times the expected rate of incidence. Further investigation revealed a connection between the high occurrence of leukemia and an error in water distribution that delivered water to the town with significant contamination with manufacturing waste containing trichloroethylene.
As an endocrine disruptor, DDT was shown to induce miscarriages, interfere with the development of the female reproductive system, cause congenital hypothyroidism, and suspectably childhood obesity.

Fluoride, when transmitted through water at high levels, can also act as a teratogen. Two reports on fluoride exposure from China, which were controlled to account for the education level of parents, found that children born to parents who were exposed to 4.12 ppm fluoride grew to have IQs that were, on average, seven points lower than their counterparts whose parents consumed water that contained 0.91 ppm fluoride. In studies conducted on rats, higher fluoride in drinking water led to increased acetylcholinesterase levels, which can alter prenatal brain development. The most significant effects were noted at a level of 5 ppm.

The fetus is even more susceptible to damage from carbon monoxide intake, which can be harmful when inhaled during pregnancy, usually through first- or second-hand tobacco smoke. The concentration of carbon monoxide in the infant born to a nonsmoking mother is around 2%, and this concentration drastically increases to a range of 6%–9% if the mother smoked tobacco. Other possible sources of prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication are exhaust gas from combustion motors, use of dichloromethane (paint thinner, varnish removers) in enclosed areas, defective gas water heaters, indoor barbeques, open flames in poorly ventilated areas, and atmospheric exposure in highly polluted areas. Exposure to carbon monoxide at toxic levels during the first two trimesters of pregnancy can lead to intrauterine growth restriction, leading to a baby who has stunted growth and is born smaller than 90% of other babies at the same gestational age. The effect of chronic exposure to carbon monoxide can depend on the stage of pregnancy in which the mother is exposed. Exposure during the embryonic stage can have neurological consequences, such as telencephalic dysgenesis, behavioral difficulties during infancy, and reduction of cerebellum volume. Also, possible skeletal defects could result from exposure to carbon monoxide during the embryonic stage, such as hand and foot malformations, hip dysplasia, hip subluxation, agenesis of a limb, and inferior maxillary atresia with glossoptosis. Also, carbon monoxide exposure between days 35 and 40 of embryonic development can lead to an increased risk of the child developing a cleft palate. Exposure to carbon monoxide or polluted ozone exposure can also lead to cardiac defects of the ventrical septal, pulmonary artery, and heart valves. The effects of carbon monoxide exposure are decreased later in fetal development during the fetal stage, but they may still lead to anoxic encephalopathy.

Industrial pollution can also lead to congenital defects. Over a period of 37 years, the Chisso Corporation, a petrochemical and plastics company, contaminated the waters of Minamata Bay with an estimated 27 tons of methylmercury, contaminating the local water supply. This led many people in the area to develop what became known as the &quot;Minamata disease&quot;. Because methylmercury is a teratogen, the mercury poisoning of those residing by the bay resulted in neurological defects in the offspring. Infants exposed to mercury poisoning &quot;in utero&quot; showed predispositions to cerebral palsy, ataxia, inhibited psychomotor development, and intellectual disability.

Landfill sites have been shown to have adverse effects on fetal development. Extensive research has shown that landfills have several negative effects on babies born to mothers living near landfill sites: low birth weight, birth defects, spontaneous abortion, and fetal and infant mortality. Studies done around the Love Canal site near Niagara Falls and the Lipari Landfill in New Jersey have shown a higher proportion of low birth-weight babies than communities farther away from landfills. A study done in California showed a positive correlation between time and quantity of dumping and low birth weights and neonatal deaths. A study in the United Kingdom showed a correlation between pregnant women living near landfill sites and an increased risk of congenital disorders, such as neural tube defects, hypospadias, epispadia, and abdominal wall defects, such as gastroschisis and exomphalos. A study conducted on a Welsh community also showed an increased incidence of gastroschisis. Another study on 21 European hazardous-waste sites showed that those living within 3 km had an increased risk of giving birth to infants with birth defects and that as distance from the land increased, the risk decreased. These birth defects included neural tube defects, malformations of the cardiac septa, anomalies of arteries and veins, and chromosomal anomalies. Looking at communities that live near landfill sites brings up environmental justice. A vast majority of sites are located near poor, mostly black, communities. For example, between the early 1920s and 1978, about 25% of Houston&#x27;s population was black. However, over 80% of landfills and incinerators during this time were located in these black communities.

Another issue regarding environmental justice is lead poisoning. A fetus exposed to lead during the pregnancy can result in learning difficulties and slowed growth. Some paints (before 1978) and pipes contain lead. Therefore, pregnant women who live in homes with lead paint inhale the dust containing lead, leading to lead exposure in the fetus. When lead pipes are used for drinking water and cooking water, this water is ingested, along with the lead, exposing the fetus to this toxin. This issue is more prevalent in poorer communities because more well-off families are able to afford to have their homes repainted and pipes renovated.

=== Endometriosis ===
Endometriosis can impact a woman&#x27;s fetus, causing a 30% higher risk for congenital malformations and a 50% higher risk of neonates being under-sized for their gestational age.

=== Smoking ===
Paternal smoking prior to conception has been linked with the increased risk of congenital abnormalities in offspring.

Smoking causes DNA mutations in the germline of the father, which can be inherited by the offspring. Cigarette smoke acts as a chemical mutagen on germ cell DNA. The germ cells suffer oxidative damage, and the effects can be seen in altered mRNA production, infertility issues, and side effects in the embryonic and fetal stages of development. This oxidative damage may result in epigenetic or genetic modifications of the father&#x27;s germline. Fetal lymphocytes have been damaged as a result of a father&#x27;s smoking habits prior to conception.

Correlations between paternal smoking and the increased risk of offspring developing childhood cancers (including acute leukemia, brain tumors, and lymphoma) before age five have been established. Little is currently known about how paternal smoking damages the fetus, and what window of time in which the father smokes is most harmful to offspring.

=== Infections ===

A vertically transmitted infection is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or in rare cases, parasites transmitted directly from the mother to an embryo, fetus, or baby during pregnancy or childbirth.

Congenital disorders were initially believed to be the result of only hereditary factors. However, in the early 1940s, Australian pediatric ophthalmologist Norman Gregg began recognizing a pattern in which the infants arriving at his surgery were developing congenital cataracts at a higher rate than those who developed it from hereditary factors. On October 15, 1941, Gregg delivered a paper that explained his findings-68 out of the 78 children with congenital cataracts had been exposed&quot; in utero&quot; to rubella due to an outbreak in Australian army camps. These findings confirmed, to Gregg, that, in fact, environmental causes for congenital disorders could exist.

Rubella is known to cause abnormalities of the eye, internal ear, heart, and sometimes the teeth. More specifically, fetal exposure to rubella during weeks five to ten of development (the sixth week particularly) can cause cataracts and microphthalmia in the eyes. If the mother is infected with rubella during the ninth week, a crucial week for internal ear development, destruction of the organ of Corti can occur, causing deafness. In the heart, the ductus arteriosus can remain after birth, leading to hypertension. Rubella can also lead to atrial and ventricular septal defects in the heart. If exposed to rubella in the second trimester, the fetus can develop central nervous system malformations. However, because infections of rubella may remain undetected, misdiagnosed, or unrecognized in the mother, and/or some abnormalities are not evident until later in the child&#x27;s life, precise incidence of birth defects due to rubella are not entirely known. The timing of the mother&#x27;s infection during fetal development determines the risk and type of birth defect. As the embryo develops, the risk of abnormalities decreases. If exposed to the rubella virus during the first four weeks, the risk of malformations is 47%. Exposure during weeks five through eight creates a 22% chance, while weeks 9–12, a 7% chance exists, followed by 6% if the exposure is during the 13th-16th weeks. Exposure during the first eight weeks of development can also lead to premature birth and fetal death. These numbers are calculated from immediate inspection of the infant after birth. Therefore, mental defects are not accounted for in the percentages because they are not evident until later in the child&#x27;s life. If they were to be included, these numbers would be much higher.

Other infectious agents include cytomegalovirus, the herpes simplex virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. Maternal exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. Microcephaly is a disorder in which the fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means certain areas of the brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or intellectual disability. Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness. Petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in red/purple spots on the skin. However, cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo. The Zika virus can also be transmitted from the pregnant mother to her baby and cause microcephaly.

The herpes simplex virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal dysplasia, hepatosplenomegaly, and intellectual disability. Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness. However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops during the first three weeks of life. Hyperthermia causes anencephaly, which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and intellectual disability in infants. Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as chorioretinitis, microphthalmus, and ocular defects. Syphilis causes congenital deafness, intellectual disability, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.

=== Malnutrition ===
For example, a lack of folic acid, a B vitamin, in the diet of a mother can cause cellular neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida. Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity can be prevented by 72% if the mother consumes 4 mg of folic acid before the conception and after twelve weeks of pregnancy. Folic acid, or vitamin B9, aids the development of the foetal nervous system.

Studies with mice have found that food deprivation of the male mouse prior to conception leads to the offspring displaying significantly lower blood glucose levels.

=== Physical restraint ===
External physical shocks or constraints due to growth in a restricted space may result in unintended deformation or separation of cellular structures resulting in an abnormal final shape or damaged structures unable to function as expected. An example is Potter syndrome due to oligohydramnios. This finding is important for future understanding of how genetics may predispose individuals for diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer.

For multicellular organisms that develop in a womb, the physical interference or presence of other similarly developing organisms such as twins can result in the two cellular masses being integrated into a larger whole, with the combined cells attempting to continue to develop in a manner that satisfies the intended growth patterns of both cell masses. The two cellular masses can compete with each other, and may either duplicate or merge various structures. This results in conditions such as conjoined twins, and the resulting merged organism may die at birth when it must leave the life-sustaining environment of the womb and must attempt to sustain its biological processes independently.

=== Genetics ===

Genetic causes of birth defects include inheritance of abnormal genes from the mother or the father, as well as new mutations in one of the germ cells that gave rise to the fetus. Male germ cells mutate at a much faster rate than female germ cells, and as the father ages, the DNA of the germ cells mutates quickly. If an egg is fertilized with sperm that has damaged DNA, a possibility exists that the fetus could develop abnormally.

Genetic disorders are all congenital (present at birth), though they may not be expressed or recognized until later in life. Genetic disorders may be grouped into single-gene defects, multiple-gene disorders, or chromosomal defects. Single-gene defects may arise from abnormalities of both copies of an autosomal gene (a recessive disorder) or of only one of the two copies (a dominant disorder). Some conditions result from deletions or abnormalities of a few genes located contiguously on a chromosome. Chromosomal disorders involve the loss or duplication of larger portions of a chromosome (or an entire chromosome) containing hundreds of genes. Large chromosomal abnormalities always produce effects on many different body parts and organ systems.

===Defective sperm===
Non-genetic defects in sperm cells, such as deformed centrioles and other components in the tail and neck of the sperm which are important for the embryonic development, may result in defects.

=== Socioeconomics ===
A low socioeconomic status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to &quot;environmental stressors and risk factors&quot;. Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly measured by the Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers &quot;unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility&quot;. In Vos&#x27; meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other studies have shown that low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are &quot;likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS&quot;. Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother&#x27;s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and &quot;living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps)&quot;. In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.

=== Radiation ===
For the survivors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, who are known as the &quot;Hibakusha&quot;, no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects/congenital malformations was found among their later conceived children, or found in the later conceived children of cancer survivors who had previously received radiotherapy.
The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were able to conceive, though exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, later had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities/birth defects than in the Japanese population as a whole.

Relatively few studies have researched the effects of paternal radiation exposure on offspring. Following the Chernobyl disaster, it was assumed in the 1990s that the germ line of irradiated fathers suffered minisatellite mutations in the DNA, which was inherited by descendants. More recently, however, the World Health Organization states, &quot;children conceived before or after their father&#x27;s exposure showed no statistically significant differences in mutation frequencies&quot;. This statistically insignificant increase was also seen by independent researchers analyzing the children of the liquidators. Animal studies have shown that incomparably &quot;massive&quot; doses of X-ray irradiation of male mice resulted in birth defects of the offspring.

In the 1980s, a relatively high prevalence of pediatric leukemia cases in children living near a nuclear processing plant in West Cumbria, UK, led researchers to investigate whether the cancer was a result of paternal radiation exposure. A significant association between paternal irradiation and offspring cancer was found, but further research areas close to other nuclear processing plants did not produce the same results. Later this was determined to be the Seascale cluster in which the leading hypothesis is the influx of foreign workers, who have a different rate of leukemia within their race than the British average, resulted in the observed cluster of 6 children more than expected around Cumbria.

=== Parent&#x27;s age ===

Certain birth complications can occur more often in advanced maternal age (greater than 35 years). Complications include fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, placental abruption, pre-mature births, and stillbirth. These complications not only may put the child at risk, but also the mother.

The effects of the father&#x27;s age on offspring are not yet well understood and are studied far less extensively than the effects of the mother&#x27;s age. Fathers contribute proportionally more DNA mutations to their offspring via their germ cells than the mother, with the paternal age governing how many mutations are passed on. This is because, as humans age, male germ cells acquire mutations at a much faster rate than female germ cells.

Around a 5% increase in the incidence of ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus in offspring has been found to be correlated with advanced paternal age. Advanced paternal age has also been linked to increased risk of achondroplasia and Apert syndrome. Offspring born to fathers under the age of 20 show increased risk of being affected by patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and the tetralogy of Fallot. It is hypothesized that this may be due to environmental exposures or lifestyle choices.

Research has found that there is a correlation between advanced paternal age and risk of birth defects such as limb anomalies, syndromes involving multiple systems, and Down syndrome. Recent studies have concluded that 5-9% of Down syndrome cases are due to paternal effects, but these findings are controversial.

There is concrete evidence that advanced paternal age is associated with the increased likelihood that a mother will have a miscarriage or that fetal death will occur.

=== Unknown ===
Although significant progress has been made in identifying the etiology of some birth defects, approximately 65% have no known or identifiable cause. These are referred to as sporadic, a term that implies an unknown cause, random occurrence regardless of maternal living conditions, and a low recurrence risk for future children. For 20-25% of anomalies there seems to be a &quot;multifactorial&quot; cause, meaning a complex interaction of multiple minor genetic anomalies with environmental risk factors. Another 10–13% of anomalies have a purely environmental cause (e.g. infections, illness, or drug abuse in the mother). Only 12–25% of anomalies have a purely genetic cause. Of these, the majority are chromosomal anomalies.

Congenital disorders are not limited to humans and can be found in a variety of other species, including cattle. One such condition is called schistosomus reflexus and is defined by spinal inversion, exposure of abdominal viscera, and limb abnormalities.

== Prevention ==

Folate supplements decrease the risk of neural tube defects. Tentative evidence supports the role of L-arginine in decreasing the risk of intrauterine growth restriction.

==Screening==

Newborn screening tests were introduced in the early 1960s and initially dealt with just two disorders. Since then tandem mass spectrometry, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and DNA analysis has made it possible for a much larger range of disorders to be screened. Newborn screening mostly measures metabolite and enzyme activity using a dried blood spot sample. Screening tests are carried out in order to detect serious disorders that may be treatable to some extent. Early diagnosis makes possible the readiness of therapeutic dietary information, enzyme replacement therapy and organ transplants. Different countries support the screening for a number of metabolic disorders (inborn errors of metabolism (IEM)), and genetic disorders including cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Tandem mass spectroscopy can also be used for IEM, and investigation of sudden infant death, and shaken baby syndrome.

Screening can also be carried out prenatally and can include obstetric ultrasonography to give scans such as the nuchal scan. 3D ultrasound scans can give detailed information of structural anomalies.

== Epidemiology ==

Congenital anomalies resulted in about 632,000 deaths per year in 2013 down from 751,000 in 1990. The types with the greatest death are congenital heart defects (323,000), followed by neural tube defects (69,000).

Many studies have found that the frequency of occurrence of certain congenital malformations depends on the sex of the child (table). For example, pyloric stenosis occurs more often in males while congenital hip dislocation is four to five times more likely to occur in females. Among children with one kidney, there are approximately twice as many males, whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 2.5 times more females. The same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs, vertebrae, teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reduction—among them there are more females. Contrarily, among the infants with their scarcity, there are more males. Anencephaly is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females. The number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls. Now various techniques are available to detect congenital anomalies in fetus before birth.

About 3% of newborns have a &quot;major physical anomaly&quot;, meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance.
Physical congenital abnormalities are the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, accounting for more than 20% of all infant deaths. Seven to ten percent of all children will require extensive medical care to diagnose or treat a birth defect.
* Data obtained on opposite-sex twins. ** — Data were obtained in the period 1983–1994.

P. M. Rajewski and A. L. Sherman (1976) have analyzed the frequency of congenital anomalies in relation to the system of the organism. Prevalence of men was recorded for the anomalies of phylogenetically younger organs and systems.

In respect of an etiology, sexual distinctions can be divided on appearing before and after differentiation of male&#x27;s gonads during embryonic development, which begins from the eighteenth week. The testosterone level in male embryos thus raises considerably. The subsequent hormonal and physiological distinctions of male and female embryos can explain some sexual differences in frequency of congenital defects. It is difficult to explain the observed differences in the frequency of birth defects between the sexes by the details of the reproductive functions or the influence of environmental and social factors.

=== United States ===
The CDC and National Birth Defect Project studied the incidence of birth defects in the US. Key findings include:
* Down syndrome was the most common condition with an estimated prevalence of 14.47 per 10,000 live births, implying about 6,000 diagnoses each year.
* About 7,000 babies are born with a cleft palate, cleft lip or both.

<text>Francisco Solano López (October 26, 1928 – August 12, 2011) was an Argentine comics artist. He was the co-creator of &quot;El Eternauta&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Buenos Aires, Solano López began his career in 1953 working for the publishing house Columba where he illustrated the series &quot;Perico y Guillerma&quot;. Working for Editorial Abril he met Héctor Germán Oesterheld, assigned to illustrate his series &quot;Bull Rocket&quot; for the magazine &quot;Misterix&quot;. They collaborated on the series &quot;Pablo Maran&quot; and &quot;Uma-Uma&quot;, before joining to start Oesterheld&#x27;s publishing house Editorial Frontera. For the Frontera&#x27;s first publication of the monthly &quot;Hora Cero&quot;, the team produced the series &quot;Rolo el marciano adoptivo&quot; and &quot;El Héroe&quot;. López also alternated as an artist on the &quot;Ernie Pike&quot; series with Hugo Pratt, Jorge Moliterni and José Antonio Muñoz. On September 4, 1957, in the publication of &quot;Hora Cero Suplemento Semanal&quot;, the science-fiction series &quot;El Eternauta&quot; made its first appearance.

A success, &quot;El Eternauta&quot; came to the attention of the authorities as the series featured commentary of the political situation of Argentina and neighbouring Chile, prompting Solano López to flee for Spain to avoid possible arrest. In 1959 Solano López began working for Fleetway in Madrid and later London, producing artwork for a host of series, including &quot;Galaxus: The Thing from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Pocket Army&quot;, &quot;The Drowned World&quot;, &quot;Janus Stark&quot;, and &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

Having returned to Argentina, Solano López resumed collaboration with Oesterheld on &quot;El Eternauta II&quot; in 1968 with a new publishing house, Editorial Records. He also started work on science-fiction saga &quot;Slot-Barr&quot; with writer Ricardo Barreiro, and the police series &quot;Evaristo&quot; with Carlos Sampayo. In the late 1970s Solano López again fled Argentina following persecution from the authorities, and from Madrid he arranged the publication of both &quot;El Eternauta&quot; and &quot;Slot-Barr&quot; with the Italian magazines &quot;LancioStory&quot; and &quot;Skorpio&quot;.

In the 1990s, Solano López produced work in the erotic comics genre, achieving hits with &quot;El Prostíbulo del Terror&quot;, from a story by Barreiro, and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;, made for the magazine &quot;Kiss Comix&quot;.

Solano López died on August 12, 2011, from a cerebral hemorrhage.

<text>Galgate is a village in the City of Lancaster, just south of Lancaster University, and about south of Lancaster itself in the English county of Lancashire.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Galgate&quot; is from &quot;Galwaithegate&quot;, a road that continues north through Cumbria, meaning &quot;the road to Galloway&quot;.
==Geography==
The River Conder runs through the village. 

==Transport==
The A6 Preston to Lancaster road runs north–south through the centre of the village, and junction 33 of the M6 is nearby.

A major railway from Preston to Lancaster passes on a viaduct over the village. The village once had its own station (Galgate railway station) but it closed in 1939 and now the nearest station is .

The Lancaster Canal also runs through the village and has a marina for narrowboats.

==Industry==
Galgate once had a thriving silk industry and many of the installations still stand. One story told is that because the rhubarb grown locally was used for dyeing the silk, Galgate&#x27;s community newsletter is named &#x27;Rhubarb City News&#x27;. Rhubarb is a prolific plant in Galgate, but this idea that it was used to dye silk seems to have no evidence to support it.

Galgate had a water powered corn mill, which was replaced by the 1792 stone three-storey wooden beamed mill of Thompson, Noble and Armstrong. It had a projecting stair tower and mill pond, with cast iron pillars inserted later. This mill is said to be the first mechanical silk mill constructed in England. The second three-storey mill was built in the early 1800s, made of stone with internal cast-iron pillars and a seven aisled roof. The third mill from 1851 is a five-storey brick built mill with corner pilasters and an internal beam engine house.

==Community==
Due to its proximity to the Lancaster University campus, some students choose to rent houses in the village. There are at least two buses an hour towards Lancaster and Garstang.

Residents in Galgate worked to raise money to build a new village hall, between the football pitch and the cricket ground, on the recreation field behind the Plough Inn. This opened in August 2012.

Two churches serve the Galgate community. St. John&#x27;s Church serves as the Anglican parish place of worship for Galgate and the wider Ellel parish. The village also has its own Methodist Church located on Chapel Lane.

The bi-monthly village newsletter, the &quot;Rhubarb City News&quot;, is put together by a team of volunteers and delivered to almost 1000 households in Galgate.

Research for an investment company in 2011 claimed that Galgate was the third best place in England and Wales to bring up children.

==People==
In July 2002 ten-year-old Jade Slack, who was visiting a friend in the village, died of a drug overdose. She took five ecstasy tablets, believing them to be sweets.
Former Radio 4 Gardener&#x27;s Question Time panellist Fred Downham was a long-term resident of the village. Alan Milburn, a former Labour minister, lived in the village whilst studying at Lancaster University.

<doc id="321278" wikidata="Q1617039" url="?curid=321278" title="Heysham">
<text>Heysham ( ) is a coastal village in the Lancaster district of Lancashire, England, overlooking Morecambe Bay. It is a ferry port, with services to the Isle of Man and Ireland, and the site of two nuclear power stations.

==History==
Of historical interest are the stone-hewn graves in the ruins of the ancient St. Patrick&#x27;s Chapel, close to St Peter&#x27;s Church. They are thought to date from the 11th century, and are carved from solid rock. Local legend has it that St Patrick landed here after crossing from Ireland and established the chapel. However it has been established that the chapel was built around 300 years after Patrick&#x27;s death. These stone graves appear on the cover of the Black Sabbath CD, &quot;The Best of Black Sabbath&quot;.
The grounds of St Peter&#x27;s Church contain many Saxon and Viking remains, and the church itself contains a Viking hogback stone. The purpose of these strange stone sculptures is the subject of much debate; they are found mainly in Northern England and also in Scotland, Wales, Ireland and a few areas of Southern England with Viking links. Four figures on the hogback have been interpreted by scholars as the four dwarfs who hold up the sky in Nordic mythology, Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, although this is debated. Heysham also has one of only three sites in Britain and Ireland that contain a pre-Roman labyrinth carving; the others are at Tintagel, Cornwall and Hollywood, Co. Wicklow, Ireland.

Lancaster Museum holds artefacts from the area such as stone axe and hammer heads, some weighing up to , dating back to the New Stone Age. Many of these artefacts and their original location suggest that this was an ancient burial ground, or barrow; the area is still known locally as &quot;The Barrows&quot;. The Barrows are the only sea-cliffs in Lancashire and contain, in a relatively small area, woodland, open grassland, sandy beaches and deep rock pools.

Heysham Heritage Centre is housed in the barn of a Longhouse in Main Street. The building is owned by the Heritage Trust for the North West, who also own the cottage part of the longhouse, 22 Main Street. The Heritage Centre is run by volunteers, most of whom belong to Heysham Heritage Association.

==Demography and governance==
Administratively, Heysham is part of the City of Lancaster district and has three wards: Heysham Central (with a population of 4,397 in 2001, increasing to 4,478 at the 2011 Census), Heysham North (5,477 in 2001, decreasing to 5,274 at the 2011 Census) and Heysham South (6,262 in 2001, increasing to 7,264 at the 2011 Census). Together they had a population of 16,136 (2001 census), and 17,016 (2011 census). These include areas beyond the village of Heysham itself, which has a population of about 6,500.

Heysham North ward is within the area covered by Morecambe Town Council.

From 1899 to 1928, Heysham was administered by Heysham Urban District Council, from 1928 to 1974 by Morecambe and Heysham Municipal Borough Council, and since 1974 by Lancaster City Council.

==Community==
Heysham is the terminus of the Stanlow–Heysham oil pipeline at the site of the former Heysham Refinery, and of a gas pipeline that originates in the Morecambe gas fields in the Irish Sea.

==Industry and transport==
Heysham Port started operation in 1904. There is a ferry service to the Isle of Man, as well as freight to Ireland and services for the eastern Irish Sea and Morecambe Bay gas fields. A SeaCat service to Belfast started in 1999. Some ferries connect with trains from Heysham Port railway station to Lancaster via the Morecambe Branch Line.

Heysham oil refinery was located between Heysham and Middleton and operated from 1941 to 1976.

The Bay Gateway dual carriageway opened in October 2016, connecting Heysham directly to the M6 motorway.

== Nature and wildlife ==
The Lancashire Wildlife Trust manages a nature reserve near to the nuclear power stations. Whitethroats breed on the scrubland. Nearby, on the sea shore is a patch of rock known as Red Nab where waders and gulls roost and congregate. Two warm water outfalls from the power stations enrich the food supply for migratory seabirds such as little gulls and Mediterranean gulls. Winter visitors include kittiwakes and purple sandpipers.

==Notable people==
The artist J. M. W. Turner visited Heysham in the 1790s when travelling throughout Britain. On a visit in August 1816, he made sketches which formed the basis of his subsequent watercolour &quot;Heysham and Cumberland Mountains&quot; (British Museum); it depicts the village with the Lakeland backdrop across Morecambe Bay.

Professional footballer David Perkins was born in Heysham.

<doc id="321279" wikidata="Q2305375" url="?curid=321279" title="Bell Rock Lighthouse">
<text>The Bell Rock Lighthouse, off the coast of Angus, Scotland, is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse. It was built between 1807 and 1810 by Robert Stevenson on the Bell Rock (also known as Inchcape) in the North Sea, east of the Firth of Tay. Standing tall, its light is visible from inland.

The masonry work on which the lighthouse rests was constructed to such a high standard that it has not been replaced or adapted in 200 years. The lamps and reflectors were replaced in 1843; the original ones are now in the lighthouse at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland, where they are currently on display. The working of the lighthouse has been automated since 24 October 1988. The Northern Lighthouse Board, which has had its headquarters at 84 George Street in Edinburgh since 1832, remotely monitors the light.

The lighthouse previously operated in tandem with a shore station, the Bell Rock Signal Tower, built in 1813 at the mouth of Arbroath harbour. Today this building houses the Signal Tower Museum, a visitor centre that offers a detailed history of the lighthouse.

Because of the engineering challenges that were overcome to build the lighthouse, it has been described as one of the Seven Wonders of the Industrial World.

==History==
According to legend, Bell Rock got its name because, in the 14th century, the Abbot of Arbroath had had a warning bell installed on it, which was stolen a year later by a Dutch pirate. (This legend is immortalised in &quot;The Inchcape Rock&quot;, a poem by the 19th-century poet Robert Southey.)

Before the construction of the lighthouse, the rock had caused many shipwrecks because, except for a few hours a day at low tide, it lies just below the surface of the sea. By the turn of the 19th century, it was estimated that, in a typical winter, as many as six ships were wrecked on the rock. (In one storm, seventy ships had been lost off the east coast of Scotland.) 

In 1799, the Masters of Trinity House in Leith (who oversaw most of the shipping issues on the eastern coast) determined to build a light on the Bell Rock, due to the high numbers of losses. They commissioned Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson to devise a design for a lighthouse on the Bell Rock, but the proposal was shelved due to concerns about cost, the relatively radical nature of the proposed design and Stevenson&#x27;s relative youth. The cost would be borne by the east coast towns (as it was not only Dundee ships being lost).

However, after the warship was wrecked on the rock in 1804 (and all aboard perished)—causing a furore in Parliament—Stevenson sent his design to the renowned engineer John Rennie. Rennie approved the design and cost estimate, which led to the passage of legislation in 1806 approving the proposal and enabling construction to begin.

The Northern Lighthouse Board awarded Rennie the contract to design and build the lighthouse and appointed Stevenson as chief assistant. The design was based on the earlier Eddystone Lighthouse, which had been designed by John Smeaton, and which Stevenson had visited and studied in detail in 1801—it too was built on an offshore reef using interlocking stones. But the Bell Rock lighthouse also contained several newer features, such as the rotating lights alternating between red and white that were designed by the carpenter Francis Watt. Stevenson&#x27;s written account of the work gave little or no credit to Rennie, and questions about &quot;[t]he apportionment of responsibility for this work led to prolonged disputes between their respective descendants, but it is now certain that while Stevenson designed the lighthouse in the main, Rennie&#x27;s role too was significant.&quot;

===Construction===
In 1807, Stevenson hired 60 men (including a blacksmith so that the pickaxes used to cut the foundations could be re-sharpened on site). Stevenson did not want to use black powder as it might have damaged the rock on which the lighthouse was to stand. The workers set sail for the rock on 17 August 1807, and would be away for two months. While initially some workers had been reluctant to agree to work even on the Sabbath in order to complete the lighthouse on time and on budget, in the end, all but four of the workers agreed to do it, and even those four (who were stonemasons) eventually also worked on Sundays.

Because the rock was covered by water for 20 hours each day (up to of water at high tide), the men lived at first on a ship moored off the rock, requiring the workers to row out to the rock and back in boats each day, which was time-consuming, and at one point, one of the boats went adrift and was lost. So the workers’ first task was to build a beacon house on tall wooden struts on the reef surrounding the rock, with places for up to 15 men, so that workers would have a place to stay on site. The foundations and beacon legs were raised during the first season. Then, in the winter, work at the rock was paused as stonemasons cut rocks for the lighthouse out of Cairngall granite.

In early 1808, work at the rock resumed. The beacon house barracks was completed and the first three courses of stone for the lighthouse were laid. In the whole of this second season only 80 hours of building work took place on the rock. During this time, while the beacon house barracks were still under construction, a young worker was knocked unconscious by a buoy ring and drowned. As he had been the primary breadwinner for his family, Stevenson offered the now-vacant position to his younger brother, Alexander Scott, who accepted.
In September 1808 John Bonnyman, a stonemason, had to have a finger amputated following an accident with the beam crane on the Rock; as recompense for this mishap he was later appointed one of the first lighthouse keepers.

Stevenson was frustrated by a visit from Rennie, in 1809, whom he saw as interfering with his work. As a strategy to ward off further visits, he wrote Rennie a total of 82 letters, asking detailed questions about a large range of construction issues (including what type of window putty and locks to use). Rennie replied in detail to every letter, but Stevenson largely ignored the replies.

In June 1809 one of the principal builders, Michael Wishart, was caught beneath a crane when it collapsed, and his feet were severely injured, preventing him from working further on the project. He asked Stevenson if he could be appointed lighthouse keeper and he ultimately took up a position as assistant keeper in 1811.

Work stopped on 22 August 1809, by which time a large part of the tower had been completed.

In January 1810, Stevenson&#x27;s twins died of whooping cough, and a fortnight later his youngest daughter Janet also died of this disease. Rennie wrote Stevenson a consoling letter. During this final period of construction the lighthouse became something of a tourist attraction. Many people were anxious to see the completion of the tallest off-shore lighthouse in the world. In this final season, while the men were staying in the beacon house, a 7-hour storm struck. Worker Charles Henderson was lost, and his body was never found. Work was finally completed after having consumed about 2500 granite stones, all drawn by one horse, Bassey.

Ultimately, the project came in 50 per cent above the original estimate of £42,000 (&quot;2009: £&quot;) budget. Since the construction of the lighthouse the only recorded shipwrecks have been that of HMS &quot;Argyll&quot; during wartime blackouts in 1915 and the Banff-registered cargo vessel &quot;Rosecraig&quot; that ran aground in fog on the evening of 21 September 1908, and sank. Her seven crew members were saved.

==Loss of HMS &quot;Argyll&quot;==

The lighthouse on the rock had been ordered to switch its lights off during the First World War for fear of assisting German U-boats in their operations, and the light was only turned on by special permission. On 28 October 1915 while in view of the lighthouse, under the command of Captain James Tancred sent a signal requesting the light to be turned on. The ship proceeded on its course believing the signal had been received, but it had not and the light was not switched on. Soon afterwards, &quot;Argyll&quot; ran aground, suffering extensive damage to much of the hull. Two destroyers— and —assisted in the rescue of her crew. Despite the damage, there were no fatalities among her crew. After all valuable items onboard had been salvaged, including her 6-inch (150 mm) guns, she was blown up by the naval salvage team. In 1970, her two large propellers were recovered by divers and sold for scrap.

==1955 helicopter accident==
On 15 December 1955, RAF Bristol Sycamore helicopter XG501, crewed by Flight Sergeant P. A. Beart and Sergeant E. F. Hall, departed from RAF Leuchars at 09:35 to perform a sea-winching exercise at the Bell Rock lighthouse. At approximately 10:00, the helicopter&#x27;s tail rotor struck the anemometer on the top of the lighthouse, and as a result the aircraft crashed into the sea. The incident was witnessed by the crew of a second helicopter that immediately transmitted a distress call and flew to the scene of the crash. In response to the distress signal, four aircraft, a further two Sycamore helicopters, an RAF rescue launch and three lifeboats searched the area, recovering the body of XG501&#x27;s navigator; the body of the pilot was not recovered. The lighthouse was damaged, including the loss of its light, but its keepers were uninjured. Owing to bad weather, the lighthouse could not be repaired until after 20 December, when conditions permitted the delivery of supplies.

==Bell Rock Races==
Several sailing clubs including Forth Corinthian at Granton and the East Lothian Yacht Club at North Berwick have used the Bell Rock and its lighthouse as a marker for yacht racing. Typically attempted by amateur sailors in cruising yachts and running through the night, the &quot;Bell Rock&quot; would be the longest and toughest race of the year at club level.

==In music and literature==
Scottish musician Alastair McDonald re-worded a traditional song called &quot;The Mermaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and set the scene on Bell Rock instead of the Eddystone light. The first verse runs:
:My father was the keeper of the Bell Rock Light
:And he married a mermaid one dark night
:And from this union there came three
:A codling and a kipper and the other was me

Arbroath musician Ian Lamb also slightly reworked the melody for the traditional song &quot;Come All Ye Tramps and Hawkers&quot; and wrote &quot;The Bell Rock Light&quot; to mark the lighthouse&#x27;s bicentenary in 2011. The first verse runs:
:We left the town of old Arbroath and set out on the sea
:The wind blew from the east that day it proved cold company
:The Inchcape Reef was our plain aim where many lives were lost
:Countless ships had hit the rock at dreadful human cost

R. M. Ballantyne&#x27;s novel&quot; The Lighthouse&quot; (1865) is centred on the construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse.

<doc id="321283" wikidata="Q708899" url="?curid=321283" title="Gregg Araki">
<text>Gregg Araki (born December 17, 1959) is an American filmmaker. He is noted for his involvement with the New Queer Cinema movement. His &quot;Teenage Apocalypse&quot; film trilogy, consisting of &quot;Totally F***ed Up &quot;(1993), &quot;The Doom Generation &quot;(1995) and &quot;Nowhere&quot; (1997), has been heralded as a cult classic. His film &quot;Kaboom&quot; (2010) was the inaugural winner of the Queer Palm at the Cannes Film Festival.

==Early life and education==
Araki was born in Los Angeles on December 17, 1959, to Japanese American parents. He grew up in nearby Santa Barbara, California, and enrolled in college at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He graduated with a B.A. from UCSB in 1982. He later attended the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts, where he graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in 1985.

==Career==
===Low-budget beginnings===
Araki made his directorial debut in 1987 with &quot;Three Bewildered People in the Night&quot;. With a budget of only $5,000 and using a stationary camera, he told the story of a romance between a video artist, her sweetheart, and her gay friend. Two years later, Araki followed up with &quot;The Long Weekend (O&#x27; Despair)&quot;, another film with a $5,000 budget. His third film, &quot;The Living End&quot; (1992), saw an increase to $20,000. He often had to shoot his early movies spontaneously and without proper permits.

Despite the financial constraints, Araki&#x27;s films received critical acclaim. He received awards from the Locarno International Film Festival and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, with an additional nomination for a Sundance Film Festival award.

Around 1992 director Jon Jost lent him a 16mm camera and gave him some film.

===&quot;Teenage Apocalypse&quot; trilogy===
Araki&#x27;s next three movies—&quot;Totally F***ed Up &quot;(1993), &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; (1995), and &quot;Nowhere&quot; (1997)—were collectively dubbed the &quot;Teenage Apocalypse&quot; trilogy. The trio has been characterized as &quot;... teen alienation, hazy sexuality and aggression.&quot; A former student of his at UC Santa Barbara, Andrea Sperling, co-produced the films with him.

The trilogy saw Araki work increasingly with more notable actors and actresses including Rose McGowan, Margaret Cho, Parker Posey, Guillermo Díaz, Ryan Phillippe, Heather Graham, and Mena Suvari among others.

The trilogy received varying degrees of reviews, from a thumbs down and &quot;zero stars&quot; by Roger Ebert to &quot;Literally the Best Thing Ever&quot; by &quot;Rookie&quot;, and was eventually heralded as cult classics.
===Subsequent efforts===
Araki&#x27;s following film, &quot;Splendor&quot; (1999), was both an homage to screwball comedies of the 1940s and 1950s and a response to the controversy surrounding his ongoing relationship (despite Araki self-identifying as gay) with actress Kathleen Robertson. Hailed as the director&#x27;s most optimistic film to date, it made its premiere at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.

Araki&#x27;s next project was the ill-fated MTV production &quot;This Is How the World Ends&quot;, originally planned with a budget of $1.5 million. He viewed it as a chance to reach the masses through MTV&#x27;s viewership and signed on to do the project despite the budget being cut to $700,000. Araki wrote, directed, and shot the pilot episode, but ultimately MTV decided against the project and the effort never aired.

Following a short hiatus, Araki returned in 2004 with the critically acclaimed &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;, based on the 1995 Scott Heim novel of the same name. This marked Araki&#x27;s first work with someone else&#x27;s source material.

Araki&#x27;s next feature was the stoner comedy &quot;Smiley Face&quot; (2007), featuring Anna Faris, Adam Brody, and John Krasinski, written by Dylan Haggerty. It marked a stark change from the dark, heavy drama of &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;, a change purposely planned by Araki. It received very favorable reviews, with some describing it as another of Araki&#x27;s potential cult classics.

&quot;Kaboom&quot; marked Araki&#x27;s tenth film and made its premiere at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. It was awarded the first ever Queer Palm for its contribution to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues.

Araki followed that film with &quot;White Bird in a Blizzard&quot; (2014), which was given limited release to mixed reviews. Araki returned to television with the 2019 series &quot;Now Apocalypse&quot;, co-executive produced by Gregory Jacobs and Steven Soderbergh on Starz.

Araki&#x27;s next film, the comedy/thriller &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;, will star Olivia Wilde, Cooper Hoffman, and Charli XCX. Production is scheduled to begin in October 2024 in Los Angeles. The screenplay was written by Araki and Karley Sciortino.

===Style===
One notable feature of Araki&#x27;s work is the frequent presence of shoegaze music. This was first seen in the soundtrack of &quot;Totally Fucked Up&quot;, and was also substantially featured in the films &quot;Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;. Both &quot;The Living End&quot; and &quot;Nowhere&quot; owe their titles to this shoegaze influence: &quot;The Living End&quot; after The Jesus and Mary Chain song of the same name, and &quot;Nowhere&quot; after Ride&#x27;s album &quot;Nowhere&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In 2010, &quot;Kaboom&quot; was named the first-ever winner of the Cannes Film Festival Queer Palm. Araki has also been honored with the 2006 Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival. In 2013, Araki was recognized by the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City with the retrospective &quot;God Help Me: Gregg Araki&quot;.

==Personal life==
Araki has previously self-identified as &quot;a gay Asian American&quot;. However, he had a relationship with actress Kathleen Robertson from 1997 to 1999. In a 2014 interview, at which time he was in a relationship with a male partner, Araki said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really identify as anything&quot;, adding &quot;I&#x27;d probably identify as gay at this point, but I have been with women.&quot;

<doc id="321294" wikidata="Q1711445" url="?curid=321294" title="Ross Bleckner">
<text>Ross Bleckner (born May 12, 1949) is an American artist. He currently lives and works in New York City. His artistic focus is on painting, and he held his first solo exhibition in 1975. Some of his art work reflected on the AIDS epidemic.

== Early life and education ==
Bleckner was born on May 12, 1949, in Brooklyn, New York and he grew up Jewish. In an interview, Bleckner commented that he was fortunate to have supportive parents. In 1961, Bleckner and his family moved to a more affluent town in Hewlett Harbor, New York, where he attended George W. Hewlett High School. In 1965, Bleckner saw his first art exhibition, &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot;, at the Museum of Modern Art, which went on to have a huge impact on his artwork. Eventually, this was a time when he realized that he wanted to become an artist. Bleckner went on to study at New York University, where he studied alongside fellow artist Sol LeWitt and Chuck Close. During college, Bleckner worked in an art supply store and drove a taxi. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A) from New York University (1971), and later received his Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A) at California Institute of the Arts (1973).

== Career ==
In 1974, when Bleckner moved back to New York, he moved into a Tribeca loft building. Three of the floors were rented to the painter Julian Schnabel and from 1977 to 1983 the Mudd Club, a nightclub frequented by musicians and artists, was in the same building. In 2004 Bleckner sold the building. He held his first solo exhibition in 1975 at Cunningham Ward Gallery in New York. Then In 1979 he began what was to become a long association with Mary Boone Gallery in New York. In 1981 Bleckner met Thomas Ammann, who was an influential Swiss art dealer who went on to collect Bleckner&#x27;s work.

Early 1990s, Bleckner did his first painting called Cell painting which showed an example of human body cell diseases. Since either the 1980s or 1990s as an openly gay artist, his art has been largely an investigation of change, loss, and memory, often addressing the subject of AIDS. Bleckner uses symbolic imagery rather than direct representation, and his work is visually elusive, with forms that constantly change focus. While much of Bleckner&#x27;s work can be divided into distinct groups or series with motifs repeated from painting to painting, he is also in the habit of redeploying and combining old motifs.

One of Bleckner&#x27;s earliest artwork that reflected the AIDS epidemic was a painting called &quot;Small Count&quot; (1990). In this painting, few white dot patterns are painted over a dark canvas. Some of the dots are bright white, while others look like it is fading. The white dots were painted to represent the white blood cells being destroyed by AIDS. Other well-known paintings related to the AIDS epidemic are &quot;8,122+ As of January 1986,&quot; and &quot;Throbbing Heart&quot; (1994). In the painting, &quot;8,122+ As of January 1986,&quot; the numbers 8, 1, 2, &amp; 2 in red are painted on the four corners respectively. The number refers to the number of people who had died from AIDS at that point in history. &quot;Throbbing Heart&quot; (1994) has red splotchlike patterns painted over a dark canvas. The patterns resemble the purple marks of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. He shows how real life is through his artwork, and how it’s like being an artist and how that affects the artist and the work they show. Bleckner doesn’t consider his work to be morbid, he sees it as life, we’re born, we live, we die. Bleckner has posited that a painting is never finished, provided it is still in his studio, because it can always be improved.

== Published writings ==
In 2009, Bleckner published a book of his theoretical art statements entitled &quot;Examined Life: Writings, 1972-2007&quot; that was published by Edgewise Press.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1995, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum had a major retrospective of his works from the last two decades of exhibitions at acclaimed institutions such as San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, and the Carnegie Museum of Art. He was one of the youngest artists to be featured at the Guggenheim.

== Collections ==

Bleckner&#x27;s works are held in collections around the world including Museum of Modern Art, New York, Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Collezione Maramotti Museum, Reggio, Italy, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Jewish Museum, New York, Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, Oslo, Norway, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Spain, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, among others.

== Philanthropy ==
Through his philanthropic efforts, Bleckner has enabled many community organizations to perform their vital work. He is on the board of AIDS Community Research Initiative of America (ACRIA), a non-profit community-based AIDS research and treatment education center. Bleckner is currently a Clinical Professor of Studio Art at New York University&#x27;s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.

In May 2009 Bleckner was awarded the title of Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). He was the first fine artist to receive the position. Later that year Bleckner travelled to Gulu, Uganda to work with former children soldiers and abductees. Together the children and Bleckner created portraits and paintings, which were sold at a United Nations benefit and through his exhibition, &quot;Welcome to Gulu&quot;, at Lehmann Maupin Gallery. Proceeds raised were used to aid to UNODC&#x27;s effort to stop human trafficking in Uganda.

== Personal life ==
Bleckner has been living in New York&#x27;s West Village since 2004. In 1993, he bought Truman Capote’s modern beach house on a five-acre property in Sagaponack, New York, for $800,000, then owned by The Nature Conservancy. Over 20 years and two major renovations, he doubled the house&#x27;s size, and had a matching 1,900 square-foot studio built on an adjoining field.

In 2018, Bleckner sued his former assistant Cody Gilman in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accusing him of attempting to extort $2 million by threatening to portray their consensual relationship as a case of sexual harassment. Shortly after, Gilman’s lawsuit was first filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, in which he sought a trial by jury, remuneration for lost wages and damages as a consequence of unwanted sexual advances, harassment and assault. Bleckner’s lawsuit was terminated in 2019 and consolidated with Gilman’s action. In 2020, the lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and dismissed with prejudice.

<doc id="321295" wikidata="Q235673" url="?curid=321295" title="Common year starting on Saturday">
<text>A common year starting on Saturday is any non-leap year (i.e. a year with 365 days) that begins on Saturday, 1 January, and ends on Saturday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is B. The most recent year of such kind was 2022, and the next one will be 2033 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2023 and 2034 in the obsolete Julian calendar. See below for more.

Any common year that starts on Saturday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this common year occurs in May. Leap years starting on Friday share this characteristic.

From July of the year that precedes this year until September in this type of year is the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Tuesday the 13th.

==Calendars==



== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, alongside Sunday, Monday, Wednesday or Friday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-three common years per cycle or exactly 10.75% start on a Saturday. The 28-year sub-cycle will break at a century year which is not divisible by 400 (e.g. it broke at the year 1900 but not at the year 2000).

=== Julian Calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). A leap year has two adjoining dominical letters, (one for January and February and the other for March to December in the Church of England, as 29 February has no letter). Each of the seven two-letter sequences occurs once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula (((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 10, 16 and 27 of the cycle are common years beginning on Saturday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years starting on Saturday.

<doc id="321325" wikidata="Q237413" url="?curid=321325" title="Karin Boye">
<text>Karin Maria Boye (; 26 October 1900 – 24 April 1941) was a Swedish poet and novelist. In Sweden, she is acclaimed as a poet, but internationally, she is best known for the dystopian science fiction novel &quot;Kallocain&quot; (1940).

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Boye was born in Gothenburg (Göteborg), Sweden in a wealthy family and moved with her family to Stockholm in 1909, eventually settling in a house in Huddinge. In Stockholm, she studied at the &quot;Åhlinska skolan&quot; until 1920. She then attended Södra seminariet, a teacher-training programme, in order to become a school teacher. She studied at Uppsala University from 1921 to 1926 and debuted in 1922 with a collection of poems, (Clouds). During her time in Uppsala and until 1930, Boye was a member of the Swedish Clarté League, a socialist group that was strongly antifascist. She was also a member of the women&#x27;s organization Nya Idun.

=== Literary career ===
In 1931, Boye, together with Erik Mesterton and Josef Riwkin, founded the poetry magazine &quot;Spektrum&quot;, introducing T. S. Eliot and the Surrealists to Swedish readers. She translated many of Eliot&#x27;s works into Swedish; she and Mesterton translated &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

Boye is perhaps most famous for her poems, the most well-known of which are (Yes, of course it hurts) and (In motion) from her collections of poems (The Hearths), 1927, and (For the tree&#x27;s sake), 1935. She was also a member of the Swedish literary institution &quot;Samfundet De Nio&quot; (The Nine Society) from 1931 until her death in 1941.

Boye&#x27;s 1931 novel &quot;Astarte&quot; was a criticism of the bourgeois culture, and won a Nordic novel prize. Her novel (Crisis) depicts her religious crisis and lesbianism. In her novels (Merit awakens) and (Too little) she explores male and female role-playing.

Outside Sweden, her best-known work is probably the novel &quot;Kallocain&quot;. Inspired by her visit to Germany during the rise of Nazism, it was a portrayal of a dystopian society in the vein of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (though written almost a decade before Orwell&#x27;s magnum opus). In the novel, an idealistic scientist named Leo Kall invents Kallocain, a kind of truth serum. The novel was filmed in Sweden in 1981 and was the main influence on the movie &quot;Equilibrium&quot;.

=== Later life ===

Between 1929 and 1932, Boye was married to another Clarté member, Leif Björck. The marriage was apparently a friendship union. In 1932, after separating from her husband, she had a lesbian relationship with Gunnel Bergström, who left her husband, poet Gunnar Ekelöf, for Boye. Following a bout of depression she left Stockholm for Berlin, where she went through psycho-analysis and affirmed her homosexuality. During the stay in Berlin in 1932–1933 she met Margot Hanel (7 April 1912 – 30 May 1941), whom she lived with for the rest of her life, and referred to as &quot;her wife&quot;.

As Boye had resigned as editor of &quot;Spektrum&quot; she earned her living from translations and writing short stories for weekly magazines. From 1936-1938 Boye was employed as teacher at Viggbyholm school, but suffered from periods of depression and suicide attempts.

Boye died by suicide on 23 April 1941. She overdosed on sleeping pills. She was found (according to the police report at the Regional Archives in Gothenburg) on 27 April, curled up at a boulder on a hill with a view just north of Alingsås, near Bolltorpsvägen, by a farmer who was going for a walk. The boulder is now a memorial stone. Margot Hanel also died by suicide shortly thereafter.

==Legacy==
Karin Boye was given two very different epitaphs. The best-known is the poem (Dead Amazon) by Hjalmar Gullberg, in which she is depicted as &quot;Very dark and with large eyes&quot;. Another poem was written by her close friend and is entitled (Dead friend). Here, she is depicted not as a heroic Amazon but as an ordinary human, small and grey in death, released from battles and pain.

Boye is also model to the character Isagel in Harry Martinson&#x27;s 1956 poem &quot;Aniara&quot;. Boye and Martinson had a close friendship in the 1930&#x27;s.

Karin Boye has been the subject of several biographies, numerous literary studies and articles, and her work have continuously been published in new Swedish editions. In 1994, her &quot;Complete Poems&quot; was published in English translation by David McDuff. Her most widely read book &quot;Kallocain&quot; has been translated to over 25 different languages.

A literary association dedicated to her work was created in 1983, keeping her work alive by spreading it among new readers. In 2004, one of the branches of the Uppsala University Library was named in her honour.

<text>Heorot (Old English &#x27;hart, stag&#x27;) is a mead-hall and major point of focus in the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. The hall serves as a seat of rule for King Hrothgar, a legendary Danish king. After the monster Grendel slaughters the inhabitants of the hall, the Geatish hero Beowulf defends the royal hall before subsequently defeating him. Later Grendel&#x27;s mother attacks the inhabitants of the hall, and she too is subsequently defeated by Beowulf.

==Name==

The name &quot;Heorot&quot; is the Old English word for a stag. Its use may stem from an association between royalty and stags in Germanic paganism. Archaeologists have unearthed a variety of Anglo-Saxon finds associating stags with royalty. For example, a sceptre or whetstone discovered in mound I of the Anglo-Saxon burial site Sutton Hoo prominently features a standing stag at its top.

In a wider Germanic context, stags appear associated with royalty with some frequency. For example, in Norse mythology—the mythology of the closely related North Germanic peoples—the royal god Freyr (Old Norse: &quot;Lord&quot;) wields an antler as a weapon. An alternative name for Freyr is &quot;Ing&quot;, and the Anglo-Saxons were closely associated with this deity in a variety of contexts (they are, for example, counted among the Ingvaeones, a Latinized Proto-Germanic term meaning &quot;friends of Ing&quot;, in Roman senator Tacitus&#x27;s first century CE &quot;Germania&quot; and, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the term &quot;ingwine&quot;, Old English for &quot;friend of Ing&quot;, is repeatedly invoked in association with Hrothgar, ruler of Heorot).

According to historian William Chaney:

Whatever the association with the stag or hart with fertility and the new year, with Frey, with dedicated deaths, or with primitive animal-gods cannot now be determined with any certainty. What is certain, however, is that the two stags most prominent from Anglo-Saxon times are both connected with kings, the emblem surmounting the unique &#x27;standard&#x27; in the royal cenotaph of Sutton Hoo and the great hall of Heorot in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Description==
The anonymous author of &quot;Beowulf&quot; praises Heorot as large enough to allow Hrothgar to present Beowulf with a gift of eight horses, each with gold-plate headgear. It functions both as a seat of government and as a residence for the king&#x27;s thanes (warriors). Heorot symbolizes human civilization and culture, as well as the might of the Danish kings—essentially, all the good things in the world of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Its brightness, warmth, and joy contrasts with the darkness of the swamp waters inhabited by Grendel.

==Location==

=== Harty, Kent ===

Though Heorot is widely considered a literary construction, a theory proposed in 1998 by the archaeologist Paul Wilkinson has suggested that it was based on a hall at Harty on the Isle of Sheppey, which would have been familiar to the anonymous Anglo-Saxon author; Harty was indeed named Heorot in Saxon times. He suggests that the steep shining sea-cliffs of &quot;Beowulf&quot; would match the pale cliffs of Sheerness on that island, its name meaning &quot;bright headland&quot;. An inlet near Harty is named &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot;, like Beowulf&#x27;s landing-place on the way to Heorot. The sea-journey from the Rhine to Kent could take the day and a half mentioned in the poem. The road to Heorot is described as a &quot;straet&quot;, a Roman Road, of which there are none in Scandinavia, but one leads across the Isle of Harty to a Roman settlement, possibly a villa. The toponymist Margaret Gelling observed that the description in &quot;Beowulf&quot; of Heorot as having a &quot;fagne flor&quot;, a shining or coloured floor, could &quot;denote the paved or tessellated floor of a Roman building&quot;. Finally, the surrounding area was named &quot;Schrawynghop&quot; in the Middle Ages, &quot;schrawa&quot; meaning &quot;demons&quot; and &quot;hop&quot; meaning &quot;land enclosed by marshes&quot;, suggestive of Grendel&#x27;s lonely fens in the poem. The archaeologist Paul Budden acknowledged &quot;the story appealed&quot; to him as a Kentish man, but felt that (as Wilkinson conceded) the subject was &quot;mythology, not archaeology or science&quot;.

=== Lejre, Zealand ===

An alternative theory sees Heorot as the accurate, but Anglicised, iteration of a historic hall in the village of Lejre, near Roskilde. Though Heorot does not appear in Scandinavian sources, King Hroðulf&#x27;s (Hrólfr Kraki) hall is mentioned in Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga as Hleiðargarðr, and located in Lejre. The medieval chroniclers Saxo Grammaticus and Sven Aggesen already suggested that Lejre was the chief residence of the Skjöldung clan (called “Scylding” in the poem). The remains of a Viking hall complex was uncovered southwest of Lejre in 1986–1988 by Tom Christensen of the Roskilde Museum. Wood from the foundation was radiocarbon-dated to about 880. It was later found that this hall was built over an older hall which has been dated to 680. In 2004–2005, Christensen excavated a third hall located just north of the other two. This hall was built in the mid-6th century, all three halls were about 50 meters long.

Fred C. Robinson is also attracted to this identification: &quot;Hrothgar (and later Hrothulf) ruled from a royal settlement whose present location can with fair confidence be fixed as the modern Danish village of Leire, the actual location of Heorot.&quot; The role of Lejre in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is discussed by John Niles and Marijane Osborn in their 2007 &quot;Beowulf and Lejre&quot;.

==Modern popular culture==

J. R. R. Tolkien, who compared Heorot to Camelot for its mix of legendary and historical associations, used it as the basis for the Golden Hall of King Théoden, Meduseld, in the land of Rohan.

&quot;The Legacy of Heorot&quot; is a science fiction novel by American writers Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Steven Barnes, first published in 1987.

&quot;Heorot&quot; is a short story in &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;″ short story collection &quot;Side Jobs&quot;.

In Zach Weinersmith&#x27;s book &quot;Bea Wolf&quot; (2023), Heorot is paralleled by the treehouse Treeheart.

<doc id="321331" wikidata="Q406695" url="?curid=321331" title="AirTran Airways">
<text>AirTran Airways was a low-cost airline in the United States that operated from 1993 until it was acquired by Southwest Airlines May 2, 2011.

Headquartered in Orlando, Florida, AirTran Airways was established in 1993 as Conquest Sun Airlines by the management of two small airlines, Destination Sun Airways and Conquest Airlines, with Conquest Airlines co-founder Victor Rivas being heavily involved in the establishment of Conquest Sun. The airline was purchased by the AirTran Corporation in 1994 and was renamed to AirTran Airways. The airline was later spun off under the new Airways Corporation holding company by the AirTran Corporation.

The airline and the Airways Corporation holding company was purchased in 1997 by the ValuJet holding company, which owned the struggling ValuJet Airlines. The ValuJet holding company became known as AirTran Holdings and merged ValuJet Airlines into AirTran Airways. ValuJet Airlines was renamed &quot;AirTran Airlines&quot; before it was merged into AirTran Airways.

AirTran Airways and parent AirTran Holdings were acquired by Southwest Airlines on May 2, 2011 and gradually integrated, with AirTran&#x27;s final revenue flight operating on December 28, 2014.

AirTran operated nearly 700 daily flights, primarily in the eastern and midwestern United States, with its principal hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where it operated nearly 200 daily departures. AirTran&#x27;s fleet consisted of Boeing 717-200 aircraft, of which it was the world&#x27;s largest operator, and Boeing 737-700 aircraft.

==History==
===Establishment &amp; early years===

AirTran Airways was founded in 1993 as Conquest Sun Airlines and began operations as a start up Boeing 737-200 operator with service to and from Orlando.

AirTran Airways was established by both the management of Destination Sun Airways and the management of regional airline Conquest Airlines. The establishment of Destination Sun Airways is unclear. It is claimed that Destination Sun was established in 1991 by former Northeastern International Airways CEO Guy Lindley and that the airline was formerly known as SunExpress and based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Another source claimed that Destination Sun was established in 1990 by a bunch of pilots that are presumably ex-Eastern Air Lines pilots since it was claimed later on by the AirTran management that the establishment of AirTran involved former Eastern Air Lines employees. Meanwhile, Conquest Airlines was founded by Rafael Rivas and Victor Rivas in April 1988 in Texas. Victor Rivas, co-founder of Conquest Airlines, was also heavily involved in the establishment of Conquest Sun Airlines.

In 1994, the airline was purchased by the AirTran Corporation, which was the holding company of the Minneapolis-based Mesaba Airlines, an operating carrier for Northwest Airlines&#x27;s Northwest Airlink that had hubs in Minneapolis and Detroit. After the purchase, the airline was renamed from Conquest Sun Airlines to AirTran Airways to reflect the name of the holding company. The airline moved its headquarters to Orlando and grew to 11 Boeing 737 aircraft, serving 24 cities in the Eastern and Midwestern United States, providing low-fare leisure travel to Orlando.

In 1995, AirTran Corporation created a new subsidiary called Airways Corporation and placed AirTran Airways under the new subsidiary; AirTran Corporation then spun off the new Airways Corporation as an independent holding company which includes AirTran Airways. After the spun off, AirTran Corporation was renamed to Mesaba Holdings after its subsidiary Mesaba Airlines to distance itself from AirTran Airways. AirTran Corporation/Mesaba Holdings was finally renamed to MAIR Holdings, which was finally dissolved in July 2012.

===Merger with ValuJet===
====The process====
On July 10, 1997, ValuJet, Inc., the parent company of the struggling ValuJet Airlines, entered into an agreement to acquire AirTran Airways and its parent Airways Corporation. After the losses of both ValuJet Flight 597 and ValuJet Flight 592, ValuJet suffered due to the perception of a lax safety culture, putting its business in jeopardy.

ValuJet purchased Airways Corporation on November 17, 1997. On that date, AirTran Airways and its parent Airways Corporation became subsidiaries of ValuJet. The ValuJet holding company changed its name to AirTran Holdings, Inc. and renamed ValuJet Airlines to AirTran Airlines. AirTran Holdings then operated two airlines with the AirTran name: AirTran Airways and AirTran Airlines (formerly ValuJet Airlines). AirTran Holdings retained ValuJet&#x27;s stock price history. The AirTran name was chosen by the merged airline&#x27;s management in hopes of distancing itself from the troubled ValuJet past. AirTran Holdings moved its headquarters to the AirTran Airways headquarters in Orlando on January 28, 1998, while ValuJet&#x27;s Atlanta hub remained the hub for the combined AirTran Airways/Airlines operation.

In April 1998, AirTran Holdings transferred all of AirTran Airlines&#x27; fleet and operations to AirTran Airways and canceled AirTran Airlines&#x27; FAA certificate. AirTran Airways now became the only airline operator for AirTran Holdings and AirTran Airlines became an inactive subsidiary of AirTran Holdings. In August 1999, AirTran Airlines was merged into AirTran Airways, legally ending the ValuJet legacy.

====Criticism====
Even though AirTran Airways was the surviving airline with its absorption of the former ValuJet Airlines which ended its operations as AirTran Airlines, ValuJet Airlines was the nominal corporate survivor of the merger. ValuJet&#x27;s management team ran the merged airline, and all SEC filings prior to 1997 were under ValuJet, not AirTran. Adding to the confusion, AirTran management did not put an effort into explaining the correct history of AirTran thoroughly.

The AirTran airline operation received criticism for the name change with &quot;Time&quot; magazine writing, &quot;In a corporate disappearing act, the troubled airline bought a smaller rival and adopted its name, becoming AirTran Airways.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in the Summer of 1997, &quot;After more than a year of reminding too many people of a disaster rather than low fares, ValuJet on Thursday said it would take a new name. ValuJet is buying a much smaller airline, AirTran Airways, from Airways Corp. for $66.3 million worth of stock and taking its name.&quot;

In an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; entitled &quot;The Lessons of ValuJet 592,&quot; William Langewiesche presents a case in which the May 11, 1996 crash in the Florida Everglades as an example of a system accident, in which the complexity of the overall operation was the major contributing factor. Taking a contrary position, Brian Stimpson argues in the &quot;Manitoba Professional Engineer&quot; that there are other examples of studied complex operations which have been routinely performed safely for many years, with such examples including large aircraft carriers and the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Station in California.

AirTran made almost no mention of its ValuJet past. However, on the tenth anniversary of the Flight 592 crash, AirTran made no major corporate announcements out of respect for the victims&#x27; families.

=== Turnaround ===

In January 1999, a new management team led by Joe Leonard, a veteran of Eastern Air Lines, and Robert L. Fornaro, of US Airways, took the reins at the airline. The two recruited a new senior management team, including Stephen J. Kolski, Operations, Kevin P. Healy, Planning, and Loral Blinde, Human Resources. The immediate goals were to stabilize the balance sheet and prepare to refinance debt due in early 2000, fix the operations, increase and establish revenue streams and prepare for delivery and operation of the Boeing 717. AirTran was the launch customer and ultimately the largest operator of this brand new aircraft. At the same time, Leonard was determined to not only lead the turn around of the carrier, but establish a culture of trust and entrepreneurship at AirTran.

===2000s===
In 1999, AirTran reported a $30 million operating profit.

On August 15, 2001, the company&#x27;s stock began trading under the ticker symbol AAI on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2002, AirTran created a regional brand, AirTran JetConnect, operated by Air Wisconsin.

In 2003, following an order for 100 Boeing 737-700 aircraft, AirTran began service to Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Reagan National Airport and to San Francisco.

On January 5, 2004, AirTran&#x27;s last McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 was retired, leaving it with a fleet of more than 70 Boeing 717-200s. Shortly after, the first Boeing 737-700 entered AirTran&#x27;s fleet in June 2004.

In August 2004, AirTran JetConnect (operated by Air Wisconsin) ceased all operations.

On May 23, 2006, AirTran accepted one of the last two Boeing 717s delivered in a ceremony with Midwest Airlines, who accepted the other 717. Boeing closed the 717 line due to poor sales.

In November 2007, Robert L. Fornaro took over as CEO, as well as president. Joe Leonard remained chairman of the Board of Directors until June 2008. Upon his retirement, Fornaro then became chairman making him chairman, president and CEO.

In 2009, AirTran was the first major airline to have 100% of its fleet outfitted with Gogo Inflight Internet, although other airlines had begun adding Internet before AirTran.

By 2009, AirTran underwent major expansion in smaller cities such as Yeager Airport (Charleston, W.V.); Asheville Regional Airport, N.C.; and Harrisburg International Airport, Pa.

====Failed acquisitions====

In 2004, AirTran sought a major expansion at Chicago-Midway Airport by buying the leases of ATA Airlines&#x27; 14 gates. Southwest Airlines made a higher bid for the gates, and AirTran lost the deal.

In December 2006, Air Tran Holdings announced that it had been trying to acquire Midwest Air Group. On August 12, 2007, AirTran announced its attempt to purchase Midwest Airlines had expired, while TPG Capital, in partnership with Northwest Airlines, had entered into an agreement to purchase Midwest Airlines for an amount larger than the AirTran Airways&#x27; proposal. However, on August 14, 2007, AirTran increased its offer to the equivalent of $16.25 a share, slightly more than the $16 a share from TPG Capital investors group. However, Midwest announced TPG would increase its offer to $17 per share and a definitive agreement had been reached late on August 16, 2007.

On September 21, 2007, AirTran pilots, represented by the National Pilots Association, rejected the carrier&#x27;s contract proposal. Two weeks earlier, the pilots voted to dump the union president and vice president. On April 10, 2009, 87% of the pilots at AirTran voted to merge the National Pilots Association with the world&#x27;s largest pilot union, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).

===2010s===

On April 6, 2010, AirTran Airways opened their second crew base, at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, the same day they officially announced Milwaukee as their second hub.

On July 27, 2010, AirTran Airways hosted the grand opening of their new System Operations Control (SOC) Center at Orlando International Airport. This , $6.9 million, state-of-the-art command center served as the 24-hour nerve center for the entire airline with over 700 flights per day. The company employed more than 1,000 crew members in central Florida at several facilities, including their corporate headquarters, the SOC, and a maintenance facility in addition to passengers operations at the airport. After considering putting the SOC Center in Atlanta, where AirTran has their largest hub, the decision was made to expand the facility in Orlando adjacent to AirTran&#x27;s headquarters.

In October 2010, a new crew base opened at Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida. The base initially employed 100 pilots, including a chief pilot.

In April 2011, AirTran had the best safety record among U.S. carriers as measured by the number of incidents such as bird strikes. AirTran was first with only 0.0000196 incidents per flight, Southwest second with 0.0000203, and US Airways third with 0.0000203 incidents per flight. Bill Voss, who was then head of the Flight Safety Foundation, said &quot;the safety record in the U.S. is so good that it&#x27;s very difficult to find enough accidents or incidents to draw much of a conclusion about who&#x27;s safest.&quot;

Prior to the winding down of the airline, AirTran grew to serve more than 70 cities coast-to-coast as well as in the Caribbean and Mexico. It has over 700 daily flights and 8,500 crew members, serving nearly 25 million passengers per year.

====Buyout and wind-down====
On September 27, 2010, Southwest Airlines announced they would acquire AirTran Airways and parent AirTran Holdings for a total cost of $1.4 billion. The acquisition gave Southwest a significant presence at many of AirTran&#x27;s hubs, such as Atlanta (then the largest U.S. city without Southwest service) and Milwaukee as well as expanded service in Baltimore and Orlando. With the acquisition, Southwest added international service to several leisure destinations such as Cancún, Montego Bay, and Aruba. Southwest integrated AirTran&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 737-700 series aircraft into Southwest Airlines brand and livery, and the Boeing 717-200 fleet was then leased out to Delta Air Lines starting in mid-2013. The airlines planned to have the acquisition completed and finalized within two years, with the two carriers operating as separate airlines in the interim. The deal closed on May 2, 2011, and a single operating certificate for the combined carrier was achieved on March 1, 2012. Total integration of all employee groups between the two carriers was completed in 2015.

On February 14, 2013, Southwest Airlines announced that they had begun codesharing with AirTran. They took the first step on January 25, 2013 by launching shared itineraries in five markets. Southwest continued launching shared itineraries with 39 more markets beginning February 25, 2013. By April 2013, shared itineraries were scheduled to be available in all Southwest and AirTran cities (both domestic and international).

Southwest announced that the integration would be completed on December 28, 2014, with AirTran Airways Flight 1 as the final scheduled departure for the airline, flying with a Boeing 717-200 (N717JL) from Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) to Tampa International Airport (TPA). The flight used the callsign &quot;Critter&quot; as a nod to ValuJet. This route and flight number had been ValuJet&#x27;s first flight.

==Corporate affairs==
Prior to its acquisition, AirTran&#x27;s corporate headquarters were located in Orlando, Florida. Prior to 1994, the headquarters were in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

===Employee relations===
AirTran adopted an approach to employee recruitment similar to Southwest Airlines, with an emphasis on functional skills and relational competence.
The airline had clear job specialization with the expectation of flexibility between jobs as required by day-to-day operational circumstances. AirTran&#x27;s training approach involved drawing the link between individual job performance, the airline&#x27;s overall financial performance and the importance of achieving high levels of customer service and efficiency.

==Destinations==
When the acquisition by Southwest was announced, AirTran served 69 destinations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and abroad.

===Top served cities===
===Codeshare agreements===
AirTran did not participate in any major global airline alliances, but it had a codeshare agreement with Frontier in 2008, followed by its parent airline, Southwest Airlines.

==Fleet==

Prior to being acquired by Southwest, the AirTran fleet maxed at the following aircraft:
In addition, AirTran&#x27;s 717 fleet included the first and last 717 ever built.

===Retired or transferred===

* Airbus A320-200 (operated by Ryan International Airlines for new U.S. west coast service prior to new 737-700 deliveries)
* Boeing 737-200
* Bombardier CRJ200 (AirTran JetConnect service operated by Air Wisconsin and SkyWest via respective code share agreements)
* McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 (former ValuJet Airlines aircraft)

==Cabin==
AirTran Airways operated a two-class configuration featuring Business Class and Economy Class. Business class included rows 1–3 and economy began with row 10; rows 4–9 were skipped for numbering purposes and 13 was skipped due to superstition.

==Livery==

AirTran&#x27;s livery was primarily white, with teal on the ventral side. The sections were divided by parallel red and pink stripes, which ran horizontal at the front and started to curve upward at the wings until they reached the top side of the plane at the back of the vertical stabilizer. The nacelles were royal blue, with &quot;airtran.com&quot; written in white Helvetica font. The logo version of &quot;AirTran&quot; was written toward the front on either side in teal above the passenger windows and the vertical stabilizer was teal with a prominent white cursive &quot;A,&quot; just like the beginning of the logo.

AirTran Airways also created several special livery aircraft. They included an aircraft featuring Elton John and Danica Patrick. AirTran also partnered with the Orlando/Orange County CVB to create a Boeing 717 aircraft emblazoned with a &quot;Say YES to Orlando&quot; logo on each side and a second Boeing 717 saying &quot;Orlando Makes Me Smile,&quot; which celebrated AirTran Airways&#x27; partnership with the OOCVB to promote travel to the city. The airline also had an aircraft paying tribute to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando.

Several aircraft featured sports-related liveries. The teams represented were the Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Indianapolis Colts, Orlando Magic, and Milwaukee Brewers.

On February 12, 2010, AirTran Airways celebrated Little Debbie&#x27;s 50th anniversary by launching a one-of-a-kind, custom-designed Boeing 717, dubbed Little Debbie 1.

<text>Scott A. Brison (born May 10, 1967) is a former Canadian politician from Nova Scotia. Brison served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Kings-Hants from the 1997 federal election until July 2000, then from November 2000 to February 2019. He was the first openly gay MP to sit as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party. In 2003, just days after the Progressive Conservatives and the more socially conservative Canadian Alliance voted to merge into the Conservative Party of Canada, Brison crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party.

Born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, Brison graduated from Dalhousie University. After entering Parliament in 2000, he served as the Minister of Public Works and Government Services from 2004 until 2006 in the Paul Martin government. In 2005, he was named by the World Economic Forum (WEF) of Davos, Switzerland, as one of its &quot;Young Global Leaders&quot;. In Opposition from 2006 to 2013, Brison has served as the Liberal Party&#x27;s Finance Critic. He was President of the Treasury Board of Canada in Justin Trudeau&#x27;s ministry until January 2019.

Brison announced on January 10, 2019, that he would not be standing in the 2019 federal election and stepped down from cabinet. On February 6, 2019, he announced he was resigning his seat in the House of Commons of Canada effective February 10, 2019. After leaving politics, Brison became Bank of Montreal&#x27;s vice-chair of investment and corporate banking and is a member of the Canadian American Business Council&#x27;s advisory board.

==Early life==
Brison was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, the son of Verna Patricia (née Salter) and Clifford Brison, who ran a grocery store. He attended Hants West Rural High School and then obtained a Bachelor of Commerce from Dalhousie University in Halifax. While there, he started and operated a successful business renting small fridges – he has jokingly referred to himself as a &quot;fridge magnate&quot;. Brison then worked in corporate sales for ten years.

==Politics==
He entered politics as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Nova Scotia riding of Kings—Hants in the 1997 election. Brison was one of a handful of new PC &quot;Young Turk&quot; MPs (along with John Herron, André Bachand and Peter MacKay) who were considered the future youthful leadership material that would restore the ailing Tories to their glory days.

In July 2000, Brison resigned his seat so that PC leader Joe Clark could enter the House of Commons. In the interim, Brison was appointed co-chair of the Tories&#x27; Election Policy Platform Committee, and became vice-president of investment banking at Yorkton Securities in Toronto.

When the 2000 election was called in October, Clark stood for election in a Calgary, Alberta riding. Brison returned as the PC candidate in Kings—Hants, and was returned to Parliament. In 2001, he served as the party&#x27;s Finance and Industry critic, and was vice-chairman of the House of Commons Finance committee. Brison came out as gay in 2002, saying that he is &quot;not a gay politician, but a politician who happens to be gay.&quot; He became the fourth sitting Member of Parliament to do so after Svend Robinson, Réal Ménard, and Libby Davies.

===Progressive Conservative leadership bid===
In 2003, following Clark&#x27;s retirement, Brison ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives on a platform of &quot;new ideas&quot;, that consisted of Employment Insurance reform, more private involvement in health care, integrated defence strategy with the US, and socially liberal policies. At the leadership convention, his campaign was dealt a crucial blow by John Herron who defected to the MacKay camp. Despite gaining votes on the second ballot, Brison was eliminated by three votes and threw his support to Jim Prentice. Prentice lost on the final ballot to Peter MacKay (who won with the support of David Orchard). He fought publicly with other members of his party, particularly Elsie Wayne, over their opposition to same-sex marriage.

===Crossing the floor===

On December 10, 2003, four days after Brison voted in favour of the PCs merging with the Canadian Alliance to form the new Conservative Party of Canada, Brison announced that he would cross the floor and sit as a Liberal MP. He stated that he had reservations about the perceived dominance of former members of the more socially conservative Canadian Alliance in the new party. Brison was criticized for this move, however, especially because he had actively supported the merger when it was first proposed. Others had also pointed out that as Finance Critic, he had been outspoken in his attacks on Paul Martin who was Finance Minister; Brison was criticized as an opportunist for switching parties and accepting a position as parliamentary secretary. Brison claimed his enthusiasm for the merger had become discernibly lukewarm in the final weeks before the vote. He indicated that he would honour his prior commitment to support the proposal, but said that he would reconsider his allegiance once the results were announced.

===Cabinet Minister===
On December 13, 2003, he was appointed as a parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister with special emphasis on Canada-U.S. Relations and sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. In the 2004 election, Brison was re-elected, his first victory as a Liberal. On July 20, 2004, Brison was named to cabinet as Minister of Public Works in Martin&#x27;s post-election shuffle. In doing so, he became Canada&#x27;s first openly gay cabinet minister.

As the youngest member of cabinet, Brison also served on three cabinet committees – Treasury Board, Domestic Affairs, and Expenditure Review. Previously, he had served as vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Finance, been a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, and the Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates.

He is also a member of the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group and has served as the vice-president of the Canadian group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union where he took part in conferences in Moscow and New York. He was also part of the Canadian delegation sent to two annual meetings of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.

On November 4, 2015, he was appointed the Treasury Board President in Justin Trudeau&#x27;s cabinet, a position he held until the end of 2018. In the summer of 2018, Brison initially committed to running in the 2019 federal election, however in December 2018 he decided to leave politics, around the time that he was linked to the controversy from the prosecution of Admiral Mark Norman. Norman&#x27;s lawyers said that Brison &quot;tried to have the (Davie Shipbuilding) deal killed on behalf of the Irving family – who operate rival Irving Shipbuilding.&quot; Announcing his decision to leave politics, Brison said at the time that it &quot;feels very right&quot; to him.

===Liberal leadership bid===
On April 22, 2006, Brison entered the race for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. His Liberal leadership platform emphasised both environmentalism and economic reform calling for a &quot;green&quot; platform that called for personal and corporate tax cuts to prompt business growth and curb pollution. Brison won 4.0% of the vote on the first ballot with 192 delegates, leaving him in 6th place out of eight candidates. He dropped out and threw his support behind Bob Rae. When Bob Rae dropped out on the third ballot and released his delegates, Scott Brison opted to support the politically similar Michael Ignatieff. The final winner of the leadership convention was Stéphane Dion.

===Electoral record===































==Personal life==
It was announced in October 2005 that he and his partner Maxime Saint-Pierre, an investment advisor with RBC Dominion Securities, intended to marry. They were married on August 18, 2007, in Brison&#x27;s riding. Their daughters, Claire Brison-St. Pierre and Rose Brison-St. Pierre, were born via a surrogate mother on February 21, 2014.

<doc id="321338" wikidata="Q513906" url="?curid=321338" title="Libby Davies">
<text>Libby Davies (born February 27, 1953) is a Canadian politician from British Columbia. She was the member of Parliament for Vancouver East from 1997 to 2015, House Leader for the New Democratic Party (NDP) from 2003 to 2011, and Deputy Leader of the party from 2007 until 2015 (alongside Thomas Mulcair under the leadership of Jack Layton and alongside Megan Leslie and David Christopherson after Mulcair became leader in 2012). Prior to entering federal politics, Davies helped found the Downtown Eastside Residents Association and served as a Vancouver city councillor from 1982 to 1993.

==Early life and career==
Davies was born in Aldershot, United Kingdom, on February 27, 1953, and immigrated to Canada in 1968 with her family. She moved to Vancouver, British Columbia in 1969. Before being elected to Parliament, she participated in many grass-roots political organizations in the Downtown Eastside area of Vancouver. She dropped out of university to help Bruce Eriksen found the Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA), an influential low-income housing advocacy group. She was instrumental in a campaign to save the Carnegie library, which was later converted into the Carnegie Community Centre serving low-income adults. From 1994 to 1997 Davies was employed by the Hospital Employees&#x27; Union.

For 24 years, Davies lived in a common-law relationship with Vancouver city councillor Bruce Eriksen, who died of cancer in 1997. They had a son, Lief. In 2001, Davies became the first female Canadian Member of Parliament to reveal that she was in a same-sex relationship.

==Political career==

===Municipal politics===
Davies&#x27; first experience in politics was serving on the Vancouver Parks Board for one term, 1980–82. She was elected to Vancouver City Council as a member of the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) in 1982 and was re-elected in 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1990. She ran for Mayor of Vancouver with the backing of COPE in 1993, losing to Philip Owen.

===Federal politics===
Davies was first elected to parliament in 1997 and re-elected in 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2008 and 2011. Previously the NDP house leader and spokesperson for housing, homelessness and multiculturalism, she became the health critic in the shadow cabinet of Jack Layton upon the NDP&#x27;s ascent to Official Opposition status. In parliament, she was a strong supporter of drug policy reform, specifically to halt the criminalization of drug users.

In 2005, during the parliamentary debate on same-sex marriage in Canada, Conservative MP Jason Kenney cited Davies&#x27; prior relationship with Eriksen as proof that marriage law does not discriminate against LGBT individuals, since a gay person can marry a member of the opposite sex. Davies, who was never formally married to Eriksen, joined other commentators in criticizing Kenney for playing politics with other parliamentarians&#x27; personal lives.

In December 2007, Davies received the Justice Gerald Le Dain Award for Achievement in the Field of Law. She was recognized for her &quot;outstanding drug policy reform work&quot; at the 2007 International Drug Policy Reform Conference, hosted by the Drug Policy Alliance and the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.

In 2009, she was interviewed for the &quot;Beyond Gay: The Politics of Pride&quot; documentary on Gay Pride celebrations internationally.

Davies faced accusations of antisemitism stemming from a June 5, 2010, interview in which she suggested that Israel has been occupied territory since 1948. She was criticized for her comments the next day in an &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; editorial. She responded to these criticisms in a letter to the &quot;Citizen&quot;, which was also posted on Davies&#x27; constituency website.

In 2011, it was announced that Davies would serve as health critic for the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet, while continuing to serve in her role as deputy leader of the NDP.

Davies declined to stand as a candidate for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 2012, citing her inability to speak French as a factor.

On December 12, 2014, Davies announced that she would retire from parliament at the 2015 general election after 18 years as a member of Parliament.

===Post-politics===

In December 2016, Davies was named a member of the Order of Canada. In 2019, she published the memoir &quot;Outside In: A Political Memoir&quot;.

<doc id="321344" wikidata="Q235690" url="?curid=321344" title="Common year starting on Thursday">
<text>A common year starting on Thursday is any non-leap year (i.e. a year with 365 days) that begins on Thursday, 1 January, and ends on Thursday, 31 December. Its dominical letter hence is D. The most recent year of such kind was 2015, and the next one will be 2026 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2021 and 2027 in the obsolete Julian calendar, see below for more.

This is the only common year with three occurrences of Friday the 13th: those three in this common year occur in February, March, and November. Leap years starting on Sunday share this characteristic, for the months January, April and July. From February until March in this type of year is also the shortest period (one month) that runs between two instances of Friday the 13th. Additionally, this is the one of only two types of years overall where a rectangular February is possible, in places where Sunday is considered to be the first day of the week. Common years starting on Friday share this characteristic, but only in places where Monday is considered to be the first day of the week.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
In the (currently used) Gregorian calendar, alongside Tuesday, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 400-year cycle (20871 weeks). Forty-four common years per cycle or exactly 11% start on a Thursday. The 28-year sub-cycle only spans across century years divisible by 400, e.g. 1600, 2000, and 2400.

This type of year has 53 weeks in the week-day format of the ISO 8601 standard.

=== Julian Calendar ===
In the now-obsolete Julian calendar, the fourteen types of year (seven common, seven leap) repeat in a 28-year cycle (1461 weeks). A leap year has two adjoining dominical letters (one for January and February and the other for March to December, as 29 February has no letter). This sequence occurs exactly once within a cycle, and every common letter thrice.

As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1). Years 3, 14 and 20 of the cycle are common years beginning on Thursday. 2017 is year 10 of the cycle. Approximately 10.71% of all years are common years beginning on Thursday.

<text>Juan Goytisolo Gay (6 January 1931 – 4 June 2017) was a Spanish poet, essayist, and novelist. He lived in Marrakesh from 1997 until his death in 2017.
He was considered Spain&#x27;s greatest living writer at the beginning of the 21st century, yet he had lived abroad since the 1950s.
On 24 November 2014 he was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Spanish-speaking world.

==Background==
Juan Goytisolo was born to an upper class family. He claimed that this level of status, accompanied by the cruelties of his great-grandfather and the miserliness of his grandfather (discovered through the reading of old family letters and documents), was a major reason for his joining the Communist party in his youth. His father was imprisoned by the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, while his mother, Julia Gay, was killed in the first Francoist air raid of Barcelona in 1938. He attended a Jesuit school in Barcelona after the Civil War, where he began writing fiction as a teenager. He later attended law school at the University of Madrid and the University of Barcelona, but left without earning a degree.

==Career==
After law studies, Goytisolo published his first novel, &quot;The Young Assassins&quot;, in 1954. In 1956 he performed six months of military service in Mataró, which inspired some of his early stories. His deep opposition to Francisco Franco led him into exile in Paris later that same year, where he worked as a reader for Gallimard. In the early 1960s, he was a friend of Guy Debord. From 1969 to 1975 he worked as a literature professor in universities in California, Boston, and New York. Breaking with the realism of his earlier novels, he published &quot;Marks of Identity&quot; (1966), &quot;Count Julian&quot; (1970), and &quot;Juan the Landless&quot; (1975). During his tenure as a professor he also worked on his controversial Spanish translation of the works of José María Blanco White, which he published in part as a critique of Francoist Spain. As with all his works, they were banned in Spain until after Franco&#x27;s death.

In 2012, Goytisolo confirmed that he was finished writing novels, saying he had nothing more to write and that it was better he kept quiet. He continued, however, to publish essays and some poetry.

&quot;Count Julian&quot; (1970, 1971, 1974) takes up, in an act of outspoken defiance, the side of Julian, count of Ceuta, a man traditionally castigated as the ultimate traitor in Spanish history. In Goytisolo&#x27;s own words, he imagines &quot;the destruction of Spanish mythology, its Catholicism and nationalism, in a literary attack on traditional Spain.&quot; He identifies himself &quot;with the great traitor who opened the door to Arab invasion.&quot; The narrator in this novel, an exile in North Africa, rages against his beloved Spain, forming an obsessive identification with the fabled Count Julian, dreaming that, in a future invasion, the ethos and myths central to Hispanic identity will be totally destroyed.

==Family==
Goytisolo was married to the publisher, novelist and screenwriter , whom he met in Paris in the 1950s. Lange was related to Emmanuel Berl and the philosopher Henri Bergson. Goytisolo and Lange had something of an open relationship, and he slept with men but &quot;love[d] only Monique&quot;. They married in 1978 and lived together until she died in 1996. After her death, he was noted as saying their once-shared Paris apartment had become like a tomb. In 1997 he moved to Marrakesh, where he died in 2017.

His brothers José Agustín Goytisolo (1928–1999) and Luis Goytisolo (1935) were also writers.

<text>Judy Grahn (born July 28, 1940) is an American poet and author.

Inspired by her experiences of disenfranchisement as a butch lesbian, she became a feminist poet, highly-regarded in underground circles before achieving public fame. A major influence in her work is Metaformic Theory, tracing the roots of modern culture back to ancient menstrual rites, though she does not regard the philosophy as exclusively feminist. Grahn teaches women&#x27;s mythology and ancient literature at the California Institute of Integral Studies  and other institutions.

==Early life and education==
Judy Rae Grahn was born in 1940 in Chicago, Illinois. Her father was a cook and her mother was a photographer&#x27;s assistant. Grahn described her childhood as taking place in &quot;an economically poor and spiritually depressed late 1950s New Mexico desert town near the hellish border of West Texas.&quot;

When she was eighteen, she eloped with a student named Yvonne at a nearby college. Grahn credits Yvonne with opening her eyes to gay culture. Soon after that she joined the United States Air Force. At twenty-one she was discharged (in a &quot;less than honorable,&quot; manner, she stated) for being a lesbian.

Grahn experienced a fair amount of homophobia during the odd jobs she did to earn money for school, trying to find housing, and was beat up for her butch attire. &quot;These jolts taught me everything I would ever need to know about the oppression of Gay people,&quot; she mentioned in an interview with &quot;Tongue&quot;.

At the age of 25, Grahn suffered from Inoculation lymphoreticulosis, or Cat Scratch Fever, which led to her being in a coma. After overcoming her illness, she realized that she wanted to become a poet. This realization was partially due to the abuse and mistreatment Grahn faced for being openly lesbian. Of the incident, Grahn stated &quot;I realized that if I was going to do what I had set out to do in my life, I would have to go all the way with it and take every single risk you could take... I decided I would not do anything I didn&#x27;t want to do that would keep me from my art.&quot;

Grahn then moved to the west coast where she became active in the feminist poetry movement of the 1970s. During this period, many rumors surfaced pertaining to Grahn&#x27;s weight and a possible eating disorder. Grahn attributes her thin frame to poor eating habits, smoking cigarettes, and drinking coffee.

She earned her PhD from the California Institute of Integral Studies. Until 2007, Grahn was the director of the Women&#x27;s Spirituality (MA) and Creative Inquiry (MFA) programs at the New College of California.

==Career==
Grahn knew she was a poet by the time she was nine. She had written poetry until she was sixteen, but it wasn&#x27;t until she was twenty-five that she consciously committed herself to her work after overcoming her illness.

Grahn was a member of the Gay Women&#x27;s Liberation Group, GWLG, the first lesbian-feminist collective on the west coast, founded in 1969. Grahn and her partner at the time, artist Wendy Cadden, produced books, poems, and graphics. This contributed the basis of the Women&#x27;s Press Collective (WPC), which strived to devote &quot;itself exclusively to work by lesbians disfranchised by race or class.&quot; GWLG is also responsible for founding the women&#x27;s bookstore A Woman&#x27;s Place. Grahn&#x27;s poems circulated in &quot;periodicals, performances, chapbooks, and by word of mouth, and were foundational documents of lesbian feminism.&quot; Her work did not extend to a commercial audience until the late 1970s; however, it garnered a wide underground audience before 1975. Carl Morse and Joan Larkin cite Grahn&#x27;s work as &quot;fueling the explosion of lesbian poetry that began in the 70s.&quot;

Grahn&#x27;s poetry is at times free verse, and is infused with her feminist lesbian identity. Her works stay true to her working-class roots, covering racism, sexism, classism, and the struggles of being female and a lesbian. She uses plain language and what the Poetry Foundation describes as an &quot;etymological curiosity that often eschews metaphor in favor of incantation.&quot; Grahn does not limit her work to just written poetry, but also collaborates with other artists such as singer-songwriter Anne Carol Mitchell and dancer and choreographer Anne Blethenthal. Her writing is heavily political and focuses on the strength of lesbian culture and critiqued heterosexist biases and the patriarchy.

Today, Grahn co-edits the online journal &quot;Metaformia&quot;, a journal about menstruation and women&#x27;s culture.

===Works===

Her first poetry collection, &quot;Edward the Dyke and Other Poems&quot; was released in 1971, and was combined with &quot;She Who&quot; (1972) and &quot;A Woman is Talking to Death&quot; (1974) in a poetry collection titled &quot;The Work of a Common Woman&quot; in 1978. In 1974 she held a reading of the poetry from the first two books at an event organized by the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective. On &quot;A Woman is Talking to Death&quot; Grahn stated that it began &quot;a redefinition for myself of the subject of love.&quot; A collection of selected and newer poems, &quot;love belongs to those who do the feeling&quot; (2008) won the 2009 Lambda Literary Award for Lesbian Poetry.

Grahn&#x27;s poetry has been used as a source of empowerment and a way to reestablish possession of words and signs of lesbian culture that are often used as derogatory by outsiders. In a short poem from the &quot;She Who&quot; collection (1971–1972) she confidently asserts, &quot;I am the dyke in the matter, the other / I am the wall with the womanly swagger / I am the dragon, the dangerous dagger / I am the bulldyke, the bulldagger.&quot;

In 1993, Grahn wrote her second book, &quot;Blood, Bread, and Roses: How Menstruation Created the World&quot; which focuses on menstrual rituals as the origin of human civilization by using anthropology, history, archeology, myths, and stories.

In addition, lines from her &quot;Common Woman&quot; collection became &quot;touchstones for the women&#x27;s movement in the seventies, such as &#x27;the common woman is as common as the best of bread/ and will rise.&#x27;&quot;

===Theory===

Margot Gayle Backus cites Grahn&#x27;s best work as her poem, &quot;A Woman is Talking to Death&quot;. She argues for its &quot;extraordinary impact on its audiences and readers&quot;, and attributes this to &quot;Grahn&#x27;s assumption of an utterly believable, vulnerable poetic voice that fearlessly and scrupulously speaks the truth to an overwhelming but nonetheless nameable, identifiable, and therefore negotiable power.&quot; Backus argues that Grahn&#x27;s &quot;prophetic poetic voice&quot; may be attributed to works such as &quot;Lycidas&quot; or that of the poets Shakespeare and Donne. Backus writes that in &quot;A Woman is Talking to Death&quot;, &quot;the central themes of the elegy and the love lyric interpenetrate in complex and innovative ways... Grahn thematically consolidates two major canonical poetic genres with deep roots in the historical development of poetic representation in Europe while radically transforming them by introducing into poetic form a broad nexus of trends in twentieth-century lesbian writing.&quot;

Grahn is a chief theorist behind Metaformic Theory, a theory that traces the roots of culture back to ancient menstrual rites. The theory first emerged in her book &quot;Blood, Bread, and Roses.&quot; Although some believe that Grahn was a separatist due to her involvement in lesbian feminism, she states that her Metaformic philosophy was inclusive.

Grahn also plays with language in her poem &quot;The woman in three pieces&quot;. Lydia Bastida Tullis cites Grahn as emphasizing language&#x27;s formal properties &quot;by increasingly straining its ability to make &#x27;sense,&#x27;&quot; and ultimately calling into question &quot;the speaker&#x27;s (and reader&#x27;s) relationship to language.&quot;

==Personal life==

From 1981 to 1986, Grahn lived in a committed relationship with poet and author, Paula Gunn Allen. The couple held regular Sunday gatherings at Mama Bears Coffeehouse and Bookstore on Telegraph Avenue in north Berkeley, to discuss topics related to women’s spirituality.

Today, Grahn lives in California and teaches at the California Institute of Integral Studies, the New College of California, and the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology. There she teaches women&#x27;s mythology and ancient literature, Metaformic Consciousness (a philosophy created by Grahn), and Uncommon Kinship – a course that uses theories from her Metaformic philosophy.

===Awards===

Grahn has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, an American Book Review award, an American Book Award, a Stonewall Book Award, and a Founding Foremothers of Women&#x27;s Spirituality Award. She received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from Publishing Triangle in 1994. In 2022, she received the Second Annual Reginald Martin Award for Excellence in Criticism from PEN Oakland for &quot;Eruptions of Inanna: Justice, Gender, and Erotic Power&quot;.

===Judy Grahn Award for Lesbian Nonfiction===

<text>Giants Stadium (sometimes referred to as Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands) was a stadium located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The venue was open from 1976 to 2010, and primarily hosted sporting events and concerts. It was the home field of the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s two National Football League teams, the New York Giants (from 1976 to 2009) and the New York Jets (from 1984 to 2009). It also was the home field of two New York metro area professional soccer teams, the NASL&#x27;s New York Cosmos (from 1977 to 1984) and Major League Soccer&#x27;s New York Red Bulls (from 1996 to 2009).

The stadium&#x27;s maximum seating capacity was 80,242. The structure was long, wide and high from service level to the top of the seating bowl and high to the top of the south tower. The volume of the stadium was , and 13,500 tons of structural steel were used in the building process while 29,200 tons of concrete were poured. It was owned and operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). The stadium&#x27;s field was aligned northwest to southeast, with the press box along the southwest sideline.

In the early 1970s, the New York Giants were sharing Yankee Stadium with the New York Yankees baseball team, and began looking for a home of their own. The Giants struck a deal with the fledgling New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority in 1971 and broke ground on the construction of the new facility in 1972. The Giants&#x27; last full season in Yankee Stadium was 1972, as the ballpark was closed for a massive reconstruction following the end of the Yankees&#x27; 1973 season. Since their new stadium would take a significant amount of time to finish, and they could not use their home facility due to the construction, the Giants moved out of state and played in New Haven, Connecticut at the Yale Bowl from October 1973 through 1974, but won just once in twelve games there. They returned to New York for one final season in 1975 and shared Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, with the Yankees, Mets, and Jets. The Giants finally moved into their new home on October 10, 1976, week five of the season.

Eight years after Giants Stadium opened, it gained a second major tenant. The Jets&#x27; lease at Shea Stadium, the home of the New York Mets, had expired at the end of the 1983 season and team owner Leon Hess was having trouble negotiating terms of a new lease to stay in Queens. The city of New York was unwilling to agree to his terms and Hess decided to move the Jets to the Meadowlands permanently (the team previously played a regular season game there in 1977). Their first game in Giants Stadium was on September 6, 1984. With the Jets now playing at the stadium, the grounds crew needed to find a way to set their games apart from Giants games and make them more inviting for their fans and eventually came up with a series of green and white banners and coverings that were hung over the field-level blue walls that circled the stadium and (later) the four entrance gates outside the stadium. The Jets also called the stadium &quot;The Meadowlands&quot; for their games.

The sharing of the stadium by both the Giants and Jets enabled it to break a record that had long been held by Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field. Entering the 2003 season, its 28th, Giants Stadium had played host to 364 NFL games, second only to the 365 played at Wrigley by the Chicago Bears in their 50 seasons there. The Giants&#x27; season opening game with the St. Louis Rams tied the record, and the following week the Jets&#x27; home opener against the Miami Dolphins broke it.

Giants Stadium was also home to the New York Cosmos, a professional soccer team of the North American Soccer League (1968–84), that attracted record crowds during the late 1970s. The stadium was later home to another soccer team, the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (now the New York Red Bulls) of Major League Soccer, who played there from 1996 to 2009.

Giants Stadium closed following the 2009 NFL season following the construction of MetLife Stadium in the surrounding parking lot. The stadium&#x27;s final event was the January 3, 2010, game featuring the Jets hosting the Cincinnati Bengals on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;. Demolition of the structure began a month after the game and was completed on August 10, 2010. The New York Giants and New York Jets both moved to MetLife Stadium in 2010.

==History==
Giants Stadium was the first major league sporting venue in New Jersey (though the Brooklyn Dodgers had played seven home games at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City in 1956 and 1957), and its success, along with that of the Giants in the 1980s was a major impetus behind increased pride and enthusiasm among New Jersey residents.

===First year in business===

Giants Stadium opened on October 10, 1976, as 76,042 fans witnessed a 24–14 loss by the Giants to the Dallas Cowboys. The Giants had played their first four games on the road that season. College football made its debut at Giants Stadium on October 23, 1976, with Rutgers University defeating Columbia 47–0 and extending their winning streak to 14 games.

===Other pro football teams that have used Giants Stadium===
Other professional football teams that have called Giants Stadium home over the years include the New Jersey Generals of the USFL; the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football; the New York/New Jersey Hitmen of the XFL and the New York Sentinels (who played one game at the stadium in the United Football League&#x27;s inaugural season). The 1985 USFL championship game which turned out to be the last USFL game played was held at Giants Stadium.

In the second week of the 2005 season, the New Orleans Saints used the stadium for a &quot;home&quot; game against the Giants because of extensive damage to the Louisiana Superdome after Hurricane Katrina. One end zone was painted in Saints colors, Saints banners were hung on the walls around the sidelines, and the Saints wore their home jerseys. The game was rescheduled to a Monday night with a special start time of 7:30 PM EDT, preceding the other scheduled game on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. The Giants were normally not visitors at Giants Stadium unless they were playing the Jets.

===College football games===
The stadium hosted college football games, including the Garden State Bowl from 1978 to 1981; the Kickoff Classic from 1983 to 2002; the New York Urban League Classic since 1981; a number of Rutgers homes games (including all their home games during the 1993 season); several Notre Dame–Navy and Notre Dame–Army games; and the Army–Navy Game on three occasions, most recently in 2002. Syracuse also played two home games at Giants Stadium during the 1979 season, against West Virginia and Penn State, while the Carrier Dome was under construction. Columbia also played some home games at Giants Stadium in 1983, due to construction at its home stadium. Temple, needing a home field due to a schedule conflict with Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, used Giants Stadium as their home field versus Penn State in September 1996. Princeton also played one home game at Giants Stadium (against Yale) during the construction of Princeton&#x27;s new stadium in 1997.

==Soccer at Giants Stadium==

The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League moved to Giants Stadium for the 1977 season, hosting the final game of Brazilian star Pelé on October 1, 1977. Giants Stadium remained as the home venue for the Cosmos until the league folded in 1985. Additionally, the NASL championship game Soccer Bowl &#x27;78 and Soccer Bowl &#x27;79 were held at Giants Stadium.

Seven games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament were held at Giants Stadium (including the Italy v Bulgaria semifinal), along with four games of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

In 2003, the SuperCoppa Italiana, an annual match pitting the winners of Serie A (Italy&#x27;s top division) and the Coppa Italia (Italian Cup), was held in Giants Stadium instead of in Italy because both clubs involved (Juventus and Milan) were touring the United States late in the summer, when the event is normally scheduled.
In 2005, the stadium played host to several matches in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, including the final, which saw the USA defeat Panama, 3–1 in a penalty shootout after the sides played to a scoreless draw. In 2007, it hosted the Gold Cup again featuring four group stage matches. In, 2009 the stadium hosted the final for the CONCACAF Gold Cup for a second time which saw Mexico defeat the USA 5–0.

It saw many European soccer tours, hosting games involving such major soccer clubs as Manchester United, Celtic, Chelsea, Liverpool, Barcelona and Rangers.

It also hosted England&#x27;s 3–2 victory over Colombia on May 31, 2005.

The New York Red Bulls (formerly the New York/New Jersey MetroStars) of Major League Soccer played at the stadium for their first 14 seasons. They moved to the soccer-specific Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison in 2010.
=== 1994 FIFA World Cup matches ===
===1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup matches===
==Pope John Paul II at Giants Stadium==
On October 5, 1995, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass during a rainstorm, before a crowd of 82,948, the second-largest to ever attend an event at Giants Stadium. The record was broken on September 24, 2009, with an attendance of 84,472 at the U2 concert.

==Concerts==
The first concert at Giants Stadium occurred on June 25, 1978, with the Beach Boys as the headliners, with the Steve Miller Band, Pablo Cruise, and Stanky Brown also performing.

The Grateful Dead played Giants Stadium 14 times between 1978 and 1995. In 2019 the Grateful Dead released the Giants Stadium 1987, 1989, 1991 boxed set. 

The stadium played host to Amnesty International&#x27;s final A Conspiracy of Hope Benefit Concert on June 15, 1986. The show was a sold-out, all-day event, running from noon until 11 p.m. and broadcast on MTV. The show was headlined by U2 and Sting and also featured Bryan Adams, Peter Gabriel, Joan Baez, the Neville Brothers, and the Police. Additional artists that performed included John Eddie, with Max Weinberg; Third World; the Hooters; Peter, Paul and Mary; Steven van Zandt, with Bob Geldof, Stanley Jordan, Joan Armatrading, Jackson Browne, Rubén Blades, with Fela Kuti and Carlos Santana, Yoko Ono, Howard Jones, Miles Davis, and Joni Mitchell. Spoken introductions were made by Billy Graham, Bill Bradley, Daryl Hannah, Robert De Niro, Christopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, and Muhammad Ali. Pete Townshend was scheduled to perform, but cancelled at the last minute, when his father, Cliff Townshend, became gravely ill, which would have been his first US solo appearance. This also marked the Police&#x27;s final full-live performance together, until their 2007 Reunion Tour, 21 years later.

The stadium played host to the Tattoo the Earth Tour on July 20, 2000. The show featured performances by Slipknot, Slayer, Sevendust, Sepultura, Hed PE, Mudvayne, downset., Hatebreed, Full Devil Jacket, Famous, Amen, U.P.O., Nothingface, PPM, Cold, Relative Ash, Systematic, Six Feet Under, Candiria, Lamb of God, God Forbid, Darkest Hour, Unearth, All That Remains, Dropkick Murphys, Sick of It All, Tiger Army, Converge, The Unseen, Reach the Sky, Stretch Arm Strong, Kill Your Idols, and Nashville Pussy, including the only appearance by Metallica during the tour and also featured 42 tattoo artists from Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Malaysia, Manitoba, Spain, Switzerland, and the US.

The stadium has also played host to music festivals, including The Monsters of Rock Festival, Music at the Meadowlands, Ozzfest, and The Bamboozle (in the parking lot, annually, since 2003).

Dave Matthews Band played the stadium 10 times from 1998 to 2007, including three nights each in 2000 and 2001. On June 11, 2001 (the first of three nights), the band played the song &quot;Two Step&quot;, where Dave Matthews sang the improvisational lyrics &quot;let it rain&quot;, where then a thunderstorm broke out. This has been called &quot;Two Step In The Rain&quot; by fans, and can be heard on The Best of What&#x27;s Around Vol. 1. When Matthews learned of the closing of Giants Stadium, he said, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll ever fall in love with a stadium like I did with Giants Stadium.&quot;

U2&#x27;s concert on September 24, 2009, on their 360 Tour, broke the Pope&#x27;s attendance record at Giants Stadium; the U2 crowd was in excess of 84,400.

Many locals say it is the home turf of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, due to the fact that they came from Freehold, New Jersey. They performed a total of 24 shows at the stadium from 1985 to 2009, with a record 10 shows during the Rising Tour in 2003. Several songs on his 1986 live album &quot;Live/1975–85&quot; were recorded at shows at the stadium in August 1985. Springsteen wrote the song &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; in response to the closing of the stadium and in 2009 performed it for the first time at the final five concerts at Giants Stadium. It would go on to be the title track of his next studio album, released over two years later.

==Seating capacity==
The seating capacity over the years went as the following:
==Demolition==
Demolition work on Giants Stadium began at approximately 10:00 AM EST on February 4, 2010, at the Gate B spirals, the closest point to the new stadium. The demolition work was expected to cost more than $10 million and took approximately four months to complete. As of May 10, 2010, approximately 50% of the Stadium had been demolished. On May 19, 2010, at 8:30 pm, demolition crews pulled down the press box, the highest part of the stadium. In the early afternoon of June 28, 2010, the last section of stadium grandstand came down, leaving just two later demolished upper-level escalators standing.

Much of the stadium&#x27;s memorabilia was sold to a sports memorabilia company, such as the framed pictures from the suites, all of the building&#x27;s signage and a good portion of the saved bowl seats. Other property was liquidated to other NJSEA facilities such as the IZOD Center and Monmouth Park Racetrack.

==Changes and co-tenants==
To accommodate these varied events, Giants Stadium sported various playing surfaces in its history. From its opening until the end of the 1999 NFL season, Giants Stadium sported an AstroTurf playing surface. This surface was covered by Bermuda grass sod for the World Cup in 1994, identical to that at the Rose Bowl where the other semifinal and the finals were held (so that both teams in the finals would have played on identical surfaces). The grass was removed after the World Cup, as it would have died in the New Jersey winter. The MetroStars installed a grass field with interchangeable trays each spring that was removed prior to football season, forcing the team to play the remainder of its season on the AstroTurf field used by the football teams. (When the New York Cosmos called Giants Stadium home, they played on the stadium&#x27;s artificial surface and never used a grass field.)

The AstroTurf was replaced in 2000 by a system of interchangeable grass trays similar to those put in place for soccer, but was kept in place under the trays to aid in draining the field when it got wet. Over the next three years, the conditions would worsen as the season went on and the field quality was typically rated just as low as the old, hard AstroTurf had been. Giants Stadium finally scrapped the grass in favor of FieldTurf for the 2003 season, a surface that remained in place until the stadium closed.

The New York Jets left Shea Stadium and moved to Giants Stadium in 1984 after years of suffering under onerous lease terms imposed at the insistence of baseball&#x27;s New York Mets. When they moved across the Hudson, many predicted the stadium would be renamed. While the Jets were attracted by the stadium&#x27;s larger capacity (it held 15,000 more seats than Shea did in its football configuration), they were understandably displeased at the prospect of playing in a facility named after another team. However, under the terms of the stadium lease, changing the name of the stadium required the approval of the Giants, and they were unwilling to do so. As such, for years afterward the Jets referred to Giants Stadium as &quot;The Meadowlands&quot; whenever they played there.

Thanks largely to the dual occupancy of Giants Stadium by two NFL teams since 1984, it surpassed Wrigley Field (home of the Chicago Bears for 50 seasons) as the venue to have hosted more NFL games than any other in league history. The game played between the Jets and Miami Dolphins on September 14, 2003, was the 366th regular season NFL game at Giants Stadium breaking Wrigley&#x27;s regular season record.

Since the stadium was originally built for the Giants, the stadium&#x27;s lower walls were blue and the seats and the stadium&#x27;s four gates were red and blue to reflect the team colors. When the Jets moved in, green banners were hung over the walls and eventually over the outer gates of the stadium anytime the team hosted a game. In addition, team-specific end zone decorations would be changed for Jets home games. This was accomplished by either painting over the Giants logos, or replacing the turf section of each end zone. Midfield decorations at the 50-yard line were typically not team-specific (in early years a Meadowlands logo, and later an NFL shield), which could be used for both teams&#x27; games.

In mid-December, traditionally the stadium hosted a Saturday-Sunday NFL doubleheader, with the Giants playing a home game one day and the Jets playing the other. The night between the games was a challenge for the stadium grounds crew, as they only had hours to convert the stadium from one team&#x27;s colors to the other. As per the NFL schedule, the Giants and the Jets play each other once every four years. In that case, there was a predetermined home team, and a predetermined away team. In those games, the away team gets a rare away game in their own home stadium. The Giants and Jets typically play each other every year in the third week of the NFL Preseason, and the teams annually rotated the home and away teams.

==Jimmy Hoffa urban legend==
For some years, a popular urban legend purported that the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, whose disappearance coincided with construction of the stadium, had been buried under one of the end zones at the field. This led &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to suggest that this &quot;takes on special meaning when a punter goes for the &#x27;coffin corner.&#x27;&quot; In a similar vein, sportscaster Marv Albert once said that a team was &quot;kicking towards the Hoffa end of the field.&quot; The rumor was referenced in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Last Exit to Springfield&quot;, when the leader of the Springfield chapter of the &quot;International Brotherhood of Jazz Dancers, Pastry Chefs and Nuclear Technicians&quot; trade union is said to have mysteriously disappeared after promising to clean up the union; the body of the missing leader is then shown buried under a football field.

The rumor was tested by the Discovery Channel show &quot;MythBusters&quot;, and they were unable to find any sign of a body. Furthermore, no human remains were found during the demolition of the stadium in 2010.

==Notable moments==

<text>Patrick Oliver Cockburn ( ; born 5 March 1950) is a journalist who has been a Middle East correspondent for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; since 1979 and, from 1990, &quot;The Independent&quot;. He has also worked as a correspondent in Moscow and Washington and is a frequent contributor to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

He has written three books on Iraq&#x27;s recent history. He won the Martha Gellhorn Prize in 2005, the James Cameron Prize in 2006, the Orwell Prize for Journalism in 2009, Foreign Commentator of the Year (Editorial Intelligence Comment Awards 2013), Foreign Affairs Journalist of the Year (British Journalism Awards 2014), Foreign Reporter of the Year (The Press Awards For 2014).

==Early life and family==
Cockburn was born in Ireland and grew up in County Cork. His parents were the well-known socialist author and journalist Claud Cockburn and Patricia Byron (née Arbuthnot), author of the book &quot;Figure of Eight.&quot; He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, an independent school in Perthshire, and then Trinity College, Oxford. He was a research student at the Institute of Irish Studies, Queens University Belfast, from 1972 to 1975. 

In 1981, Cockburn married Janet Elisabeth (&quot;Jan&quot;) Montefiore (14 November 1948), Professor of English Literature at the University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, daughter of the late Bishop Hugh Montefiore, and has two children, Henry Cockburn (4 January 1982) and Alexander Cockburn (17 April 1987). His two brothers also became journalists, Alexander Cockburn, who died in 2012, and Andrew Cockburn, and a half-sister was mystery writer Sarah Caudwell. Journalists Laura Flanders and Stephanie Flanders are his nieces, daughters of his half-sister Claudia Flanders, and civil rights lawyer Chloe Cockburn and actress Olivia Wilde are his nieces, daughters of Andrew and Leslie Cockburn.

Cockburn is a descendant of Sir George Cockburn, a British commander during the Burning of Washington.

== Career ==

=== Newspaper correspondent ===
Cockburn began his career in 1979 shortly after leaving his PhD in Irish History at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast due to the violence of the troubles that he began in 1972. He worked for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as its Middle East correspondent until 1990, when he left and joined &quot;The Independent&quot; to cover the Gulf War. He befriended Robert Fisk in Belfast and the two remained in contact until Fisk&#x27;s death in October 2020.

==Writings==
Cockburn has written three books on Iraq. The first, &quot;Out of the Ashes: The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein&quot;, was written with his brother Andrew prior to the war in Iraq. The book was later re-published in Britain under the title &quot;Saddam Hussein: An American Obsession&quot;. Two more books were written by Cockburn after the U.S. invasion, following his reporting from Iraq. &quot;The Occupation: War and Resistance in Iraq&quot; (2006) mixes first hand accounts with reporting. Cockburn&#x27;s book is critical of the invasion as well as the Salafi fundamentalists who comprised much of the insurgency. &quot;The Occupation&quot; was nominated for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle award for nonfiction. The second, &quot;Muqtada: Muqtada al-Sadr, the Shia Revival, and the Struggle for Iraq&quot; was published in 2008. &quot;Muqtada&quot; is a journalistic account of the recent history of the religiously and politically prominent Sadr family, the rise of Muqtada, and the development of the Sadrist Movement since the 2003 U.S. invasion. He is also the author of &quot;The Jihadis Return: Isis and the New Sunni Uprising&quot; (2014), which has been translated into nine languages, and &quot;The Rise of Islamic State: Isis and the New Sunni Revolution&quot; (2015). Both are about how the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was able to set up its own state in northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

Cockburn has written a memoir, &quot;The Broken Boy&quot; (2005), which describes his childhood in 1950s Ireland, as well as an investigation of the way polio was handled – Cockburn himself caught and survived polio in 1956. He has also published a collection of essays on the Soviet Union, titled &quot;Getting Russia Wrong: The End of Kremlinology&quot; (1989). He co-wrote the book &quot;Henry&#x27;s Demons&quot; with his son, Henry, which explains their coming to terms with the latter&#x27;s diagnosis with schizophrenia. Cockburn also writes for &quot;CounterPunch&quot; and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

== Views ==
Cockburn is critical of embedded journalism, writing in the &quot;Independent&quot; in 2010 &quot;...There is a more subtle disadvantage to &quot;embedding&quot;: it leads reporters to see the Iraqi and Afghan conflicts primarily in military terms, while the most important developments are political or, if they are military, may have little to do with foreign forces&quot;. He later added &quot;...Halfway through the Iraq war, one bureau chief lamented to me, saying: &quot;The only fairly safe place for me to send young reporters, who haven&#x27;t been to Iraq before, is on &#x27;embeds&#x27;, but then they drink up everything the army tells them and report it as fact.&quot; The best reporting in any single publication during the height of the sectarian slaughter in Iraq in 2006–07 was in The New York Times, which got round this dilemma by simply hiring experienced and highly regarded correspondents from other newspapers.&quot; 

On the relationship between the Covid-19 pandemic and wars, Cockburn wrote in a blog for Verso in 2020 &quot;None of the wars I covered then have ever really ended. What has happened, however, is that they have largely ended up receding, if not disappearing, from the news agenda. I suspect that, if a successful vaccine for Covid-19 isn’t found and used globally, something of the same sort could happen with the coronavirus pandemic as well. &quot;

==Criticism==
Cockburn was criticised by Idrees Ahmad for an apparent claim made in his 2015 book &quot;The Rise of Islamic State&quot; about the Adra massacre of Alawites and Christians during the Syrian Civil War. Ahmad wrote that in the book Cockburn was apparently claiming to be a witness to the massacre and that this claim disagreed with Cockburn&#x27;s reportage at the time, in which he stated he learned of the killings via &quot;a Syrian [Assad regime] soldier who gave his name as Abu Ali&quot;. Ahmad also questioned whether the massacre had taken place. Cockburn said that he had not claimed to be a witness to the massacre. Rather, he charged, an &quot;obvious error&quot; had been, at best, misconstrued by Ahmad. Cockburn said that it was his contemporary report that was correct, that he did not witness the massacre and admonished Ahmad for doubting the fact of the massacre, mentioning &quot;reports from the AP and Reuters news agencies&quot; describing the massacre by Islamic militants and quoting local witnesses. Cockburn&#x27;s publisher explained the error arose from the publisher summarising but misunderstanding writings by Cockburn, that Cockburn had never claimed to be a witness and that the error would be corrected in subsequent printings of the book. The publisher criticised Ahmad for using a &quot;minor&quot; mistake &quot;made evident by text that surrounds and contradicts it&quot; to &quot;impugn the integrity&quot; of Cockburn.

<text>The Chain of Chance (original Polish title: &quot;Katar&quot;, literally, &quot;Rhinitis&quot;/Catarrh) is a science fiction/detective novel by the Polish writer Stanisław Lem, published in 1976. Lem&#x27;s treatment of the detective genre introduces many nontraditional elements. The reader is prompted not only to consider various suspects as possible culprits in a series of murders, but also the possibility that &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as a mysterious event&quot; and they have all happened purely by chance (hence the English title). In this way, the natural laws of probability and chaos theory play the role of suspects and characters in a murder mystery, lending elements of science fiction to the novel. The underlying philosophical idea is expanded on by Lem in his major essay &quot;The Philosophy of Chance&quot;.

==Plot==
A former astronaut is hired by a detective agency to help in an investigation of a case of mysterious deaths. Several victims became mad and committed suicide during their vacation in various Naples spas, apparently without reason. Due to certain similarities in the circumstances of the deaths and the profiles of the victims the case is assumed to be a serial murder by poisoning, although it is never certain what (if any) real connection exists between the victims.

During the investigation, it becomes apparent that certain innocent chemicals can be combined into a strong depressor, a kind of chemical weapon. The hero experiences its effects, but his training helps him to survive and solve the case. He discovers the industrial sources of the chemicals, and demonstrates how random chance chemical reactions led to the string of deaths.

==Comments==
One of chemical compounds involved in the deadly mixture comes from an anti-allergic drug, which the hero takes for allergic rhinitis, hence the novel&#x27;s original title.

Comparing to Lem&#x27;s other mystery novel, &quot;The Investigation,&quot; Lem himself notes that the latter one is rather overstretched, while the story in &quot;Katar&quot; is more credible.

==Translations==
In 1979 the novel (translated as &quot;Le Rhume&quot; in French) received the French literary prize Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in the International category.

In 1998 it was translated in Romanian as &quot;Catarul&quot; by Mihai Mitu and published by .

In 2020 it was translated in Italian as &quot;Febbre da fieno&quot; translated by ,

His film &quot;The Red Army&quot;, produced for PBS in 1981, was the first in-depth report on the serious deficiencies of Soviet military power and won a Peabody Award. In 1982, his book &quot;The Threat – Inside the Soviet Military Machine&quot; was published by Random House; it examined the same topic in greater depth. He subsequently published many articles on the subject of US and Soviet military power as well as lecturing at numerous military bases, foreign policy forums, and colleges and innumerable television shows. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he began covering Middle Eastern subjects, including the 1991 documentary on the after-effects of the first Gulf War, &quot;The War We Left Behind&quot;, which he co-produced for PBS with Leslie Cockburn.

In 1988, Andrew and Leslie Cockburn wrote, produced and directed the PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;Guns, Drugs and the CIA&quot; about the CIA&#x27;s role in international drug dealings.

In 2009 he and Leslie Cockburn produced &quot;American Casino&quot;, a feature-length documentary on the financial crisis of 2007–2008. &quot;New Yorker&quot; critic David Denby called it &quot;A terrific documentary... Everything is connected: the movie embodies chaos theory for social pessimists.&quot; Apart from his books he has written for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;Dungarvan Observer&quot;. He is Washington Editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

In 2007, Cockburn wrote &quot;Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy&quot; (subtitled &quot;An American Disaster&quot; in the UK edition). In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewer Jacob Heilbrunn called it &quot;perceptive and engrossing.&quot;

He wrote &quot;21st Century Slaves&quot; for &quot;National Geographic&quot;, which reported on the practice of modern-day slavery. He authored &quot;Kill Chain – The Rise of the High-Tech Assassins&quot; (2015), which details the evolution of drone warfare, and the shift to assassination as the principal US military strategy. &quot;Kirkus Review&quot; called it &quot;sharp-eyed and disturbing.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1977, he married Leslie Corkhill Redlich in San Francisco. They have three children: Chloe Frances, the actress Olivia Wilde, and Charles Philip.

However, in 1946 the US Strategic Bombing Survey had concluded that – thanks to the destruction of its economy by conventional bombing and a comprehensive blockade – &quot;in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped.&quot; (p. 9.)

<doc id="321363" wikidata="Q727159" url="?curid=321363" title="Fiasco (novel)">
<text>Fiasco () is a science fiction novel by Polish author Stanisław Lem, first published in a German translation in 1986. The book, published in Poland the following year and translated into English by Michael Kandel in the same year, is a further elaboration of Lem&#x27;s skepticism: in Lem&#x27;s opinion, the difficulty in communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (the main theme of the novel) is more likely cultural disparity rather than spatial distance. It was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award.

The novel was written on order from publisher S. Fischer Verlag around the time Lem was emigrating from Poland due to the introduction of martial law. Lem stated that this was the only occasion he wrote something upon publisher&#x27;s request, accepting an advance for a nonexistent novel.

==Plot summary==
At a base on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, a young spaceship pilot Parvis sets out in a strider (a mecha-like machine) to find several missing people, among them Pirx (the spaceman appearing in Lem&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Pirx the Pilot&quot;). Parvis ventures to the dangerous geyser region, where the others were lost. Unfortunately, he suffers an accident. Seeing no way to get out of the machine and return to safety, he triggers a built-in cryogenic device.

An expedition is sent to a distant star in order to make first contact with a civilization that may have been detected. It is set more than a century after the prologue, when a starship is built in Titan&#x27;s orbit. This future society is described as globally unified and peaceful with high regard for success. During starship preparations, the geyser region is cleared, and the frozen bodies are discovered. They are exhumed and taken aboard, to be awakened, if possible, during the voyage. However, only one of them can be revived (or more precisely, pieced together from the organs of several of them) with a high likelihood of success. The identity of the man is unclear; it has been narrowed to two men (whose last names begin with &#x27;P&#x27;). It is never revealed whether he is in fact Pirx or Parvis (and he seems to have amnesia). In his new life, he adopts the name Tempe.

The explorer spaceship &quot;Eurydika&quot; (Eurydice) first travels to a black hole near the Beta Harpiae to perform maneuvers to minimize the effects of time dilation. Before closing on the event horizon, the &quot;Eurydice&quot; launches the &quot;Hermes&quot;, a smaller explorer ship, which continues to Beta Harpiae.

Approaching the planet Quinta, which exhibits signs of harboring intelligent life, the crew of the &quot;Hermes&quot; attempts to establish contact with the denizens of the planet, who, contrary to the expectations of the mission&#x27;s crewmen, are strangely unwilling to communicate. The crew reaches the conclusion that there is a Cold War-like state on the planet&#x27;s surface and throughout the planetary system, halting the locals&#x27; industrial development.

The crew of the &quot;Hermes&quot; assumes that the Quintan civilisation is inevitably doomed to collapse in mutual assured destruction. They try to force the aliens to engage contact by means of an event impossible to hide by the aliens&#x27; governments: staging the implosion of their moon. Surprisingly, just before impact, several of the deployed rockets are destroyed by missiles of the Quintans, undermining the symmetry of the implosion which causes fragments of the moon to be thrown clear, some impacting the planet&#x27;s surface.

However, even this cataclysm does not drive the locals to engage with their alien visitors, so the crewmen deploy a device working as a giant lens or laser, capable of displaying images (but also concentrating beams to the point of being a powerful weapon). Following a suggestion by Tempe, they show the Quintans a &quot;fairy tale&quot; by projecting a cartoon onto Quinta&#x27;s clouds. At last, the Quintans contact the &quot;Hermes&quot; and make arrangements for a meeting. The humans do not trust the Quintans, so to gauge the Quintans&#x27; intentions, they send a smaller replica of the &quot;Hermes&quot; which is destroyed shortly before landing. The humans retaliate by firing their laser on the ice ring around the planet, shattering it and sending chunks falling on the planet.

Finally, the Quintans are forced to receive an &#x27;ambassador&#x27;, who is Tempe; the Quintans are warned that the projecting device will be used to destroy the planet if the man should fail to report back his continued safety. After landing, Tempe discovers that there is no trace of anyone at the landing site. After investigating a peculiar structure nearby, he finds a strange-looking mound, which he opens with a small shovel. To his horror, he notices that in his distracted state he has allowed the allotted time to expire without signaling his crewmates. As the planet is engulfed by fiery destruction at the hands of those who were sent to establish contact with its denizens, Tempe finally realizes what the Quintans are. However, he has no time to share his discovery with the others.

== Interpretation ==
The book is the fifth in Lem&#x27;s series of pessimistic first contact scenarios, after &quot;Eden&quot;, &quot;Solaris&quot;, &quot;The Invincible&quot;, and &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot;. 

According to critic Paul Delany:

<doc id="321364" wikidata="Q217026" url="?curid=321364" title="Leap year starting on Saturday">
<text>A leap year starting on Saturday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Saturday, 1 January, and ends on Sunday, 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are BA. The most recent year of such kind was 2000, and the next one will be 2028 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise 2012 and 2040 in the obsolete Julian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, years divisible by 400 are always leap years starting on Saturday. The most recent such occurrence was 2000 and the next one will be 2400, see below for more.

Any leap year that starts on Saturday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this leap year occurs in October. Common years starting on Sunday share this characteristic, but also have another in January. From August of the common year preceding that year until October in this type of year is also the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Friday the 13th. Common years starting on Tuesday share this characteristic, from July of the year that precedes it to September in that type of year.

These types of years are the only ones which contain 54 different calendar weeks (2 partial, 52 in full) in areas of the world where Sunday is considered the first day of the week, and also the only type of year to contain 53 full weekends.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Saturday, along with those starting on Monday and Thursday, occur least frequently: 13 out of 97 (≈ 13.402%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Their overall occurrence is thus 3.25% (13 out of 400).



=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Saturday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<text>A railway track ( and UIC terminology) or railroad track (), also known as permanent way () or &quot;P Way&quot; ( and Indian English), is the structure on a railway or railroad consisting of the rails, fasteners, sleepers (railroad ties in American English) and ballast (or slab track), plus the underlying subgrade. It enables trains to move by providing a dependable, low-friction surface on which their wheels can roll. Early tracks were constructed with wooden or cast-iron rails, and wooden or stone sleepers. Since the 1870s, rails have almost universally been made from steel.

==Historical development==

The first railway in Britain was the Wollaton wagonway, built in 1603 between Wollaton and Strelley in Nottinghamshire. It used wooden rails and was the first of about 50 wooden-railed tramways built over the subsequent 164 years. These early wooden tramways typically used rails of oak or beech, attached to wooden sleepers with iron or wooden nails. Gravel or small stones were packed around the sleepers to hold them in place and provide a walkway for the people or horses that moved wagons along the track. The rails were usually about long and were not joined - instead, adjacent rails were laid on a common sleeper. The straight rails could be angled at these joints to form primitive curved track.

The first iron rails laid in Britain were at the Darby Ironworks in Coalbrookdale in 1767.

When steam locomotives were introduced, starting in 1804, the track then in use proved too weak to carry the additional weight. Richard Trevithick&#x27;s pioneering locomotive at Pen-y-darren broke the plateway track and had to be withdrawn. As locomotives became more widespread in the 1810s and 1820s, engineers built rigid track formations, with iron rails mounted on stone sleepers, and cast-iron chairs holding them in place. This proved to be a mistake, and was soon replaced with flexible track structures that allowed a degree of elastic movement as trains passed over them.

==Structure==
===Traditional track structure===

Traditionally, tracks are constructed using flat-bottomed steel rails laid on and spiked or screwed into timber or pre-stressed concrete sleepers (known as ties in North America), with crushed stone ballast placed beneath and around the sleepers.

Most modern railroads with heavy traffic use continuously welded rails that are attached to the sleepers with base plates that spread the load. When concrete sleepers are used, a plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate. Rail is usually attached to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North America. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable amount of this track remains on secondary and tertiary routes.

In North America and Australia, flat-bottomed rails were typically fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate. In Britain and Ireland, bullhead rails were carried in cast-iron chairs which were spiked to the sleepers. In 1936, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail in Britain, though earlier lines had made some use of it.

Jointed rails were used at first because contemporary technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.

Timber sleepers are of many available timbers, and are often treated with creosote, chromated copper arsenate, or other wood preservatives. Pre-stressed concrete sleepers are often used where timber is scarce and where tonnage or speeds are high. Steel is used in some applications.

Track ballast is usually stone crushed to particular specifications. Its purpose is to support the sleepers and allow some adjustment of their position while allowing free drainage.

===Ballastless track===

A disadvantage of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining to restore the desired track geometry and smoothness of vehicle running. Weakness of the subgrade and drainage deficiencies also lead to heavy maintenance costs. This can be overcome by using ballastless track. In its simplest form this consists of a continuous slab of concrete (like a highway structure) with the rails supported directly on its upper surface (using a resilient pad).

There are a number of proprietary systems; variations include a continuous reinforced concrete slab and the use of pre-cast pre-stressed concrete units laid on a base layer. Many permutations of design have been put forward.

However, ballastless track has a high initial cost, and in the case of existing railroads the upgrade to such requires closure of the route for a long period. Its whole-life cost can be lower because of the reduction in maintenance. Ballastless track is usually considered for new very high speed or very high loading routes, in short extensions that require additional strength (e.g. railway stations), or for localised replacement where there are exceptional maintenance difficulties, for example in tunnels. Most rapid transit lines and rubber-tyred metro systems use ballastless track.

===Continuous longitudinally supported track===
Early railways (c. 1840s) experimented with &quot;continuous bearing&quot; railtrack, in which the rail was supported along its length, with examples including Brunel&#x27;s baulk road on the Great Western Railway, as well as use on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to a design by John Hawkshaw, and elsewhere. Continuous-bearing designs were also promoted by other engineers. The system was tested on the Baltimore and Ohio railway in the 1840s, but was found to be more expensive to maintain than rail with cross sleepers.

This type of track still exists on some bridges on Network Rail where the timber baulks are called waybeams or longitudinal timbers. Generally the speed over such structures is low.

Later applications of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty&#x27;s &#x27;embedded slab track&#x27;, which uses a rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or pre-cast) concrete base (development 2000s). The &#x27;embedded rail structure&#x27;, used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC 54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a &#x27;mushroom&#x27; shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).

Modern ladder track can be considered a development of baulk road. Ladder track utilizes sleepers aligned along the same direction as the rails with rung-like gauge restraining cross members. Both ballasted and ballastless types exist.

==Rail==
Modern track typically uses hot-rolled steel with a profile of an asymmetrical rounded I-beam. Unlike some other uses of iron and steel, railway rails are subject to very high stresses and have to be made of very high-quality steel alloy. It took many decades to improve the quality of the materials, including the change from iron to steel. The stronger the rails and the rest of the trackwork, the heavier and faster the trains the track can carry.

Other profiles of rail include: bullhead rail; grooved rail; flat-bottomed rail (Vignoles rail or flanged T-rail); bridge rail (inverted U–shaped used in baulk road); and Barlow rail (inverted V).

North American railroads until the mid- to late-20th century used rails long so they could be carried in gondola cars (open wagons), often long; as gondola sizes increased, so did rail lengths.

According to the &quot;Railway Gazette International&quot; the planned-but-cancelled 150-kilometre rail line for the Baffinland Iron Mine, on Baffin Island, would have used older carbon steel alloys for its rails, instead of more modern, higher performance alloys, because modern alloy rails can become brittle at very low temperatures.

=== Iron-topped wooden rails ===

Early North American railroads used iron on top of wooden rails as an economy measure but gave up this method of construction after the iron came loose, began to curl, and intruded into the floors of the coaches, leading early railroaders to refer to them as &quot;snake heads&quot;.

The Deeside Tramway in North Wales used this form of rail. It opened around 1870 and closed in 1947, with long sections still using these rails. It was one of the last uses of iron-topped wooden rails.

===Rail classification (weight)===

Rail is graded by its linear density, that is, its mass over a standard length. Heavier rail can support greater axle loads and higher train speeds without sustaining damage than lighter rail, but at a greater cost. In North America and the United Kingdom, rail is graded in pounds per yard (usually shown as &quot;pound&quot; or &quot;lb&quot;), so &quot;130-pound rail&quot; would weigh . The usual range is . In Europe, rail is graded in kilograms per metre and the usual range is . The heaviest mass-produced rail was , rolled for the Pennsylvania Railroad.

==Rail lengths==
The rails used in rail transport are produced in sections of fixed length. Rail lengths are made as long as possible, as the joints between rails are a source of weakness. Throughout the history of rail production, lengths have increased as manufacturing processes have improved.

=== Timeline ===
The following are lengths of single sections produced by steel mills, without any thermite welding. Shorter rails may be welded with flashbutt welding, but the following rail lengths are unwelded.
* (1767) Richard Reynolds laid the first iron rails at Coalbrookdale.
* (1825) Stockton and Darlington Railway 
* (1830) Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Fish-belly rails at , laid mostly on stone blocks
* (1831) long and weighing , reached Philadelphia the first use of the flanged T-rail in the United States
* (1880) United States to suit gondola waggons
* (1928) London, Midland and Scottish Railway
* (1950) British Rail
* (1900) – steel works weighing machine for rails (steelyard balance)
* (1940s) – double 39 ft
* (1953) Australia

Welding of rails into longer lengths was first introduced around 1893, making train rides quieter and safer. With the introduction of thermite welding after 1899, the process became less labour-intensive, and ubiquitous.

* (1895) Hans Goldschmidt developed exothermic welding
* (1899) the Essen Tramway became the first railway to use thermite welding; also suited track circuits
* (1904) George Pellissier welded the Holyoke Street Railway, first to use the process in the Americas
* (1935) Charles Cadwell developed non-ferrous exothermic welding
* (1950) welded – (4 x )

Modern production techniques allowed the production of longer unwelded segments.
* (2007) Corus (now British Steel (2016–present))
* (2011) Tata Steel Europe

===Multiples===
Newer longer rails tend to be made as simple multiples of older shorter rails, so that old rails can be replaced without cutting. Some cutting would be needed as slightly longer rails are needed on the outside of sharp curves compared to the rails on the inside.

===Boltholes===
Rails can be supplied pre-drilled with boltholes for fishplates or without where they will be welded into place. There are usually two or three boltholes at each end.

==Joining rails==
Rails are produced in fixed lengths and need to be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal fishplates (jointbars in the US), producing &quot;jointed track&quot;. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form &quot;continuous welded rail&quot; (CWR).

===Jointed track===

Jointed track is made using lengths of rail, usually about long (in the UK) and long (in North America), bolted together using perforated steel plates known as &quot;fishplates&quot; (UK) or &quot;joint bars&quot; (North America).

Fishplates are usually long, used in pairs either side of the rail ends and bolted together (usually four, but sometimes six bolts per joint). The bolts have alternating orientations so that in the event of a derailment and a wheel flange striking the joint, only some of the bolts will be sheared, reducing the likelihood of the rails misaligning with each other and worsening the derailment. This technique is not applied universally; European practice is to have all the bolt heads on the same side of the rail.

Small gaps which function as expansion joints are deliberately left between the rail ends to allow for expansion of the rails in hot weather. European practice was to have the rail joints on both rails adjacent to each other; North American practice is to stagger them. Because of these small gaps, when trains pass over jointed tracks they make a &quot;clickety-clack&quot; sound, and in time the rail ends are deflected downwards. Unless it is well-maintained, jointed track does not have the ride quality of welded rail and is not suitable for high speed trains. However, jointed track is still used in many countries on lower-speed lines and sidings, and is used extensively in poorer countries due to the lower construction cost and the simpler equipment required for its installation and maintenance.

A major problem of jointed track is cracking around the bolt holes, which can lead to breaking of the rail head (the running surface). This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to continuous welded rail.

====Insulated joints====
Where track circuits exist for signalling purposes, insulated block joints are required. These compound the weaknesses of ordinary joints. Specially-made glued joints, where all the gaps are filled with epoxy resin, increase the strength again.

As an alternative to the insulated joint, audio frequency track circuits can be employed using a tuned loop formed in approximately of the rail as part of the blocking circuit. Some insulated joints are unavoidable within turnouts.

Another alternative is an axle counter, which can reduce the number of track circuits and thus the number of insulated rail joints required.

===Continuous welded rail===

Most modern railways use &quot;continuous welded rail&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;ribbon rails&quot; or &quot;seamless rails&quot;. In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924. and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.

The preferred process of flash butt welding involves an automated track-laying machine running a strong electric current through the touching ends of two unjoined rails. The ends become white hot due to electrical resistance and are then pressed together forming a strong weld. Thermite welding is used to repair or splice together existing continuous welded rail segments. This manual process requires a reaction crucible and form to contain the molten iron.

North American practice is to weld segments of rail at a rail facility and load it on a special train to carry it to the job site. This train is designed to carry many segments of rail which are placed so they can slide off their racks to the rear of the train and be attached to the ties (sleepers) in a continuous operation.

If not restrained, rails would lengthen in hot weather and shrink in cold weather. To provide this restraint, the rail is prevented from moving in relation to the sleeper by use of clips or anchors. Attention needs to be paid to compacting the ballast effectively, including under, between, and at the ends of the sleepers, to prevent the sleepers from moving. Anchors are more common for wooden sleepers, whereas most concrete or steel sleepers are fastened to the rail by special clips that resist longitudinal movement of the rail. There is no theoretical limit to how long a welded rail can be. However, if longitudinal and lateral restraint are insufficient, the track could become distorted in hot weather and cause a derailment. Distortion due to heat expansion is known in North America as sun kink, and elsewhere as buckling. In extreme hot weather special inspections are required to monitor sections of track known to be problematic. In North American practice, extreme temperature conditions will trigger slow orders to allow for crews to react to buckling or &quot;sun kinks&quot; if encountered. The German railway company Deutsche Bahn is starting to paint rails white to lower the peak temperatures reached in summer days.

After new segments of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if the temperature of the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are a bit like a piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down. In extremely cold weather, rails are heated to prevent &quot;pull aparts&quot;.

Continuous welded rails, complete with fastenings, are laid at a temperature known as &quot;rail neutral temperature&quot; that is approximately midway between the extremes experienced at that location. This installation procedure is intended to prevent tracks from buckling in summer heat or pulling apart in the winter cold. In North America, because broken rails are typically detected by interruption of the current in the signaling system, they are seen as less of a potential hazard than undetected heat kinks.
Joints are used in the continuous welded rail when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes straight across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut at an angle to give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an &quot;expansion joint&quot;) gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.

==Sleepers==

A sleeper (tie or crosstie) is a rectangular object on which the rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the rails to the track ballast and the ground underneath, and to hold the rails to the correct width apart (to maintain the rail gauge). They are generally laid transversely to the rails.

===Fixing rails to sleepers===

Various methods exist for fixing the rail to the sleeper. Historically, rails were spiked directly on to ties, the practice giving way baseplates being fitted between the rails and sleepers; subsequently, spikes were replaced by sprung steel clips, such as &quot;Pandrol clips&quot;, to fix the rail to the baseplates.

==Portable track==

Sometimes rail tracks are designed to be portable and moved from one place to another as required. During construction of the Panama Canal, tracks were moved around excavation works. These track gauge were and the rolling stock full size. Portable tracks have often been used in open pit mines. In 1880 in New York City, sections of heavy portable track (along with much other improvised technology) helped in the move of the ancient obelisk in Central Park to its final location from the dock where it was unloaded from the cargo ship &quot;SS Dessoug&quot;.

Cane railways often had permanent tracks for the main lines, with portable tracks serving the canefields themselves. These tracks were narrow-gauge (for example, ) and the portable track came in straights, curves, and turnouts, rather like on a model railway.

Decauville was a source of many portable light rail tracks, also used for military purposes.

The &quot;permanent way&quot; is so called because &quot;temporary way&quot; tracks were often used in the construction of that permanent way.

==Layout==

The geometry of the tracks is three-dimensional by nature, but the standards that express the speed limits and other regulations in the areas of track gauge, alignment, elevation, curvature and track surface are usually expressed in two separate layouts for horizontal and vertical.

Horizontal layout is the track layout on the horizontal plane. This involves the layout of three main track types: &quot;tangent track&quot; (straight line), &quot;curved track&quot;, and &quot;track transition curve&quot; (also called &quot;transition spiral&quot; or &quot;spiral&quot;) which connects between a tangent and a curved track.

Vertical layout is the track layout on the vertical plane including the concepts such as crosslevel, cant and gradient.

A &quot;sidetrack&quot; is a railroad track other than siding that is auxiliary to the main track. The word is also used as a verb (without object) to refer to the movement of trains and railcars from the main track to a siding, and in common parlance to refer to giving in to distractions apart from a main subject. Sidetracks are used by railroads to order and organise the flow of rail traffic.

===Gauge===

During the early days of rail, there was considerable variation in the gauge used by different systems, and in the UK during the railway building boom of the 1840s Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge of was in competition with what was referred to at the time as the &#x27;narrow&#x27; gauge of . Eventually the gauge won the battle, and became the standard gauge, with the term &#x27;narrow gauge&#x27; henceforth used for gauges narrower than the new standard. , about 60% of the world&#x27;s railways use a gauge of , known as standard or international gauge Gauges wider than standard gauge are called broad gauge; narrower, narrow gauge. Some stretches of track are dual gauge, with three (or sometimes four) parallel rails in place of the usual two, to allow trains of two different gauges to use the same track.

Gauge can safely vary over a range. For example, U.S. federal safety standards allow standard gauge to vary from to for operation up to .

==Maintenance==

Track needs regular maintenance to remain in good order, especially when high-speed trains are involved. Inadequate maintenance may lead to a &quot;slow order&quot; (North American terminology, or temporary speed restriction in the United Kingdom) being imposed to avoid accidents (see Slow zone). Track maintenance was at one time hard manual labour, requiring teams of labourers, or trackmen (US: gandy dancers; UK: platelayers; Australia: fettlers or packers) under the supervision of a skilled ganger, who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the track, and tamping and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface). Currently, maintenance is facilitated by a variety of specialised machines.
The surface of the head of each of the two rails can be maintained by using a railgrinder.

Common maintenance jobs include changing sleepers, lubricating and adjusting switches, tightening loose track components, and surfacing and lining track to keep straight sections straight and curves within maintenance limits. The process of sleeper and rail replacement can be automated by using a track renewal train.

Spraying ballast with herbicide to prevent weeds growing through and redistributing the ballast is typically done with a special weed killing train.

Over time, ballast is crushed or moved by the weight of trains passing over it, periodically requiring relevelling (&quot;tamping&quot;) and eventually to be cleaned or replaced. If this is not done, the tracks may become uneven, causing swaying, rough riding and possibly derailments. An alternative to tamping is to lift the rails and sleepers and reinsert the ballast beneath. For this, specialist &quot;stoneblower&quot; trains are used.

Rail inspections utilize nondestructive testing methods to detect internal flaws in the rails. This is done by using specially equipped HiRail trucks, inspection cars, or in some cases, handheld inspection devices.

Rails must be replaced before the railhead profile wears to a degree that may trigger a derailment. Worn mainline rails usually have sufficient life remaining to be used on a branch line, siding or stub afterwards and are &quot;cascaded&quot; to those applications.

The environmental conditions along railroad track create a unique railway ecosystem. This is particularly so in the United Kingdom, where steam locomotives are only used on special services and vegetation has not been trimmed back so thoroughly. This creates a fire risk in prolonged dry weather.

In the UK, the cess is used by track repair crews to walk to a work site, and as a safe place to stand when a train is passing. This helps when doing minor work, while needing to keep trains running, by not needing a Hi-railer or transport vehicle blocking the line to transport crew to get to the site.


==Bed and foundation==

Railway tracks are generally laid on a bed of stone track ballast or track bed, which in turn is supported by prepared earthworks known as the track formation. The formation comprises the subgrade and a layer of sand or stone dust (often sandwiched in impervious plastic), known as the blanket, which restricts the upward migration of wet clay or silt. There may also be layers of waterproof fabric to prevent water penetrating to the subgrade. The track and ballast form the permanent way. The foundation may refer to the ballast and formation, i.e. all man-made structures below the tracks.

Some railroads are using asphalt pavement below the ballast in order to keep dirt and moisture from moving into the ballast and spoiling it. The fresh asphalt also serves to stabilize the ballast so it does not move around so easily.

Additional measures are required where the track is laid over permafrost, such as on the Qingzang Railway in Tibet. For example, transverse pipes through the subgrade allow cold air to penetrate the formation and prevent that subgrade from melting.

=== Geosynthetic reinforcement ===
Geosynthetics are used to reduce or replace traditional layers in trackbed construction and rehabilitation worldwide to improve track support and reduce track maintenance costs. Reinforcement geosynthetics, such as geocells (which rely on 3D soil confinement mechanisms) have demonstrated efficacy in stabilizing soft subgrade soils and reinforcing substructural layers to limit progressive track degradation. Reinforcement geosynthetics increase soil bearing capacity, limit ballast movement and degradation and reduce differential settlement that affects track geometry. They also reduce construction time and cost, while reducing environmental impact and carbon footprint. The increased use of geosynthetic reinforcement solutions is supported by new high-performance geocell materials (e.g., NPA - Novel Polymeric Alloy), published research, case studies projects and international standards (ISO, ASTM, CROW/SBRCURnet)

The hybrid use of high-performance geogrids at the subgrade and high-performance geocell in the upper subbase/subballast layer has been shown to increase the reinforcement factor greater than their separate sums, and is particularly effective in attenuating heaving of expansive subgrade clay soils. A field test project on Amtrak&#x27;s NE Corridor suffering clay mud-pumping demonstrated how the hybrid solution improved track quality index (TQI) significantly reduced track geometry degradation and lowered track surface maintenance by factor of 6.7x utilizing high-performance NPA geocell. Geosynthetic reinforcement is also used to stabilize railway embankments, which must be robust enough to withstand repeated cyclical loading. Geocells can utilize recycled marginal or poorly graded granular material to create stable embankments, make railway construction more economical and sustainable.

==Buses==
Some buses can use tracks. This concept came out of Germany and was called . The first such track, the O-Bahn Busway, was built in Adelaide, Australia.

<text>The Independent Baptist Church of America traces its foundation back to a church organization by Swedish Free Baptist immigrants at Dassel, Minnesota in 1893. The body was initially known as the Scandinavian Baptist Church in America. In 1926 the denomination had 13 churches with 222 members. The name Independent Baptist Church of America was adopted in 1927. In 1936, there were 5 churches in Minnesota with 82 members. In 1956, there were 2 churches with 106 members, and down to 70 members in 1963. The church ceased to exist in the 1970s.

== Reorganization ==
A church was reorganized under the name Independent Baptist Churches of America, by Rev. Kirk M. Livingood. He was ordained in Florida in 1986 by Rev. Robert G. Montanus. The IBCA was re-incorporated in the State of Iowa. The IBCA is the acronym for The Independent Baptist Churches of America, currently located in Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A. Kirk Micah Livingood is the senior pastor &amp; current presiding president of both the IBCA and the IBBCA.

The IBCA owns the Independent Baptist Bible College of America, also located in Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A. (commonly referred to as the IBBCA). Religious courses are conducted both by classroom studies, and by correspondence studies. All students are required to attend 4 of the 8 yearly seminars in order to graduate from the IBBCA, and to earn their degrees.

The headquarters of the IBCA is:
IBCA, Inc.
P.O. Box 857
Iowa City, Iowa 52244-0857

There is no apparent historical connection between the historic Independent Baptist Church of America and the reorganized Independent Baptist Churches of America. Membership statistics are unavailable.

<doc id="321371" wikidata="Q1744361" url="?curid=321371" title="Cottaging">
<text>Cottaging is a gay slang term, originating from the United Kingdom, referring to anonymous sex between men in a public lavatory (a &quot;cottage&quot; or &quot;tea-room&quot;), or cruising for sexual partners with the intention of having sex elsewhere. The term has its roots in self-contained English toilet blocks resembling small cottages in their appearance; in the English cant language of Polari this became a &quot;double entendre&quot; by gay men referring to sexual encounters.

The word &quot;cottage&quot;, usually meaning a small, cosy, countryside home, is documented as having been in use during the Victorian era to refer to a public toilet and by the 1960s its use in this sense had become an exclusively homosexual slang term. This usage is predominantly British, though the term is occasionally used with the same meaning in other parts of the world. Among gay men in the United States, lavatories used for this purpose are called &quot;tea rooms&quot;.

==Locations==

Cottages were and are located in places heavily used by many people such as bus stations, railway stations, airports and university campuses. Often, glory holes are drilled in the walls between cubicles in popular cottages. Foot signals—tapping a foot, sliding a foot slightly under the divider between stalls, attracting the attention of the occupant of the next stall—are used to signify that one wishes to connect with the person in the next cubicle. In some heavily used cottages, an etiquette develops and one person may function as a lookout to warn if non-cottagers are coming.

Since the 1980s, more individuals in authority have become more aware of the existence of cottages in places under their jurisdiction and have reduced the height of or even removed doors from the cubicles of popular cottages, or extended the walls between the cubicles to the floor to prevent foot signalling.

==Cottages as meeting places==
Before the gay liberation movement, many, if not most, gay and bisexual men at the time were closeted and there were almost no public gay social groups for those under legal drinking age. As such, cottages were among the few places where men too young to get into gay bars could meet others whom they knew to be gay.

The internet brought significant changes to cottaging, which was previously an activity engaged in by men with other men, often in silence with no communication beyond the markings of a cubicle wall. Today, an online community is being established in which men exchange details of locations, discussing aspects such as when it receives the highest traffic, when it is safest and to facilitate sexual encounters by arranging meeting times. The term &quot;cybercottage&quot; is used by some gay and bisexual men who use the role-play and nostalgia of cottaging in a virtual space or as a notice board to arrange real life anonymous sexual encounters.

Laud Humphrey&#x27;s &quot;Tearoom Trade,&quot; published in 1970, was a sociological analysis and observance between the social space public &quot;restrooms&quot; (as toilets are euphemistically known in the US) offer for anonymous sex and the men—either closeted, gay, or straight—who sought to fulfill sexual desires that their wives, religion, or social lives could not. The study, which was met with praise on one side due to its innovation and criticism on the other due to having outed &quot;straight&quot; men and risked their privacy, brought to light the multidimensionality of public restrooms and the intricacy and complexity of homosexual sex amongst self-identifying straight men.

==Legal status==

Sexual acts in public lavatories are outlawed by many jurisdictions. It is likely that the element of risk involved in cottaging makes it an attractive activity to some.

Historically, in the United Kingdom, public gay sex often resulted in a charge and conviction of gross indecency, an offence only pertaining to sexual acts committed by males and particularly applied to homosexual activity. Anal penetration was a separate and much more serious crime that came under the definition of buggery. Buggery was a capital offence between 1533 and 1861 under UK law, although it rarely resulted in a death sentence. Importuning was an offer of sexual gratification between men, often for money. The Sexual Offences Act 1967 permitted sex between consenting men over 21 years of age when conducted in private, but the act specifically excluded public lavatories from being &quot;private&quot;. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 replaced this aspect with the offence of &quot;Sexual activity in a public lavatory&quot; which includes solo masturbation.

In some of the cases where people were brought to court for cottaging, the issue of entrapment arose. Since the offences were public but often carried out behind closed lavatory doors, the police sometimes found it easier to use undercover police officers, who would frequent toilets posing as homosexuals in an effort to entice other men to approach them for sex. These men would then be arrested for importuning or soliciting and in some cases indecent assault. 

===Timeline of historic cases===
==Cultural response==
* After the murder of playwright Joe Orton by his boyfriend Kenneth Halliwell in 1967, Orton&#x27;s diaries were published and included explicit accounts of cottaging in London toilets. The diaries were the basis of the 1987 film &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; and the play of the same name.
* The film &quot;Get Real&quot; was based on the 1992 play &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with Angry?&quot;, which features schoolboys cottaging as a key theme.
*The 1992 play &quot;Porcelain&quot; by Singaporean-born playwright Chay Yew describes cottaging as a backdrop of violence between a gay Asian man and his white lover in a Bethnal Green lavatory.
* The Chinese film &quot;East Palace, West Palace&quot;, released in 1996, is centred on cottaging activity in Beijing.
*The modern dance company, DV8, staged a piece in 2003 called&quot; Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM)&quot;, which explicitly portrayed the theme of cottaging.
* Nicholas de Jongh&#x27;s play &quot;Plague Over England&quot; was based on the arrest and conviction of John Gielgud for cottaging and premièred in 2008.
* The 2017 video game &quot;The Tearoom&quot; by independent developer Robert Yang simulates cottaging practices set in a public restroom in 1962 Mansfield, Ohio.

<text>A high-level assembler in computing is an assembler for assembly language that incorporate features found in a high-level programming language.

The earliest high-level assembler was probably Burroughs&#x27; Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language (ESPOL) in about 1960, which provided an ALGOL-like syntax around explicitly-specified Burroughs B5000 machine instructions. This was followed by Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s PL360 in 1968; this replicated the Burroughs facilities, with which he was familiar, on an IBM System/360. More recent high-level assemblers are Borland&#x27;s Turbo Assembler (TASM), Netwide Assembler (NASM), Microsoft&#x27;s Macro Assembler (MASM), IBM&#x27;s High Level Assembler (HLASM) for z/Architecture systems, Alessandro Ghignola&#x27;s Linoleum, X# used in Cosmos and Ziron.

High-level assemblers typically provide instructions that directly assemble one-to-one into low-level machine code as in any assembler, plus control statements such as IF, WHILE, REPEAT...UNTIL, and FOR, macros, and other enhancements. This allows the use of high-level control statement abstractions wherever maximal speed or minimal space is not essential; low-level statements that assemble directly to machine code can be used to produce the fastest or shortest code. The end result is assembly source code that is far more readable than standard assembly code while preserving the efficiency inherent with using assembly language.

High-level assemblers generally provide information-hiding facilities and the ability to call functions and procedures using a high-level-like syntax (i.e., the assembler automatically produces code to push parameters on the call stack rather than the programmer having to manually write the code to do this).

High-level assemblers also provide data abstractions normally found in high-level languages. Examples include: data structures, unions, classes, and sets. Some high-level assemblers (e.g., TASM and High Level Assembly (HLA)) support object-oriented programming.

<doc id="321374" wikidata="Q217036" url="?curid=321374" title="Leap year starting on Friday">
<text>A leap year starting on Friday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Friday 1 January and ends on Saturday 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are CB. The most recent year of such kind was 2016, and the next one will be 2044 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2000 and 2028 in the obsolete Julian calendar.

Any leap year that starts on Friday has only one Friday the 13th: the only one in this leap year occurs in May. Common years starting on Saturday share this characteristic.

== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Friday, along with those starting on Sunday, occur most frequently: 15 of the 97 (≈ 15.46%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, their overall occurrence is 3.75% (15 out of 400).

For this kind of year, the ISO week 10 (which begins March 7) and all subsequent ISO weeks occur later than in all other leap years.


=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Friday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<doc id="321380" wikidata="Q217019" url="?curid=321380" title="Leap year starting on Thursday">
<text>A leap year starting on Thursday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Thursday 1 January, and ends on Friday 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are DC. The most recent year of such kind was 2004, and the next one will be 2032 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 2016 and 2044 in the obsolete Julian calendar.

This is the only leap year with three occurrences of Tuesday the 13th: those three in this leap year occur three months (13 weeks) apart: in January, April, and July. Common years starting on Monday share this characteristic, in the months of February, March, and November.

Any leap year that starts on Thursday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this leap year occur in February and August. This is also the only year in which February has five Sundays, as the leap day adds that extra Sunday.
== Calendars ==

== Applicable years ==
=== Gregorian Calendar ===
Leap years that begin on Thursday, along with those starting on Monday and Saturday, occur least frequently: 13 out of 97 (≈ 13.402%) total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Their overall occurrence is thus 3.25% (13 out of 400).

For this kind of year, the corresponding ISO year has 53 weeks, and the ISO week 10 (which begins March 1) and all subsequent ISO weeks occur earlier than in all other years, and exactly one week earlier than common years starting on Friday, for example, June 20 falls on week 24 in common years starting on Friday, but on week 25 in leap years starting on Thursday, despite falling on Sunday in both types of year. That means that moveable holidays may occur one calendar week later than otherwise possible, e.g. Gregorian Easter Sunday in week 17 in years when it falls on April 25 and which are also leap years, falling on week 16 in common years.

=== Julian Calendar ===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Thursday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula (((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<doc id="321382" wikidata="Q1341307" url="?curid=321382" title="Energy flow (ecology)">
<text>Energy flow is the flow of energy through living things within an ecosystem. All living organisms can be organized into producers and consumers, and those producers and consumers can further be organized into a food chain. Each of the levels within the food chain is a trophic level. In order to more efficiently show the quantity of organisms at each trophic level, these food chains are then organized into trophic pyramids. The arrows in the food chain show that the energy flow is unidirectional, with the head of an arrow indicating the direction of energy flow; energy is lost as heat at each step along the way.

The unidirectional flow of energy and the successive loss of energy as it travels up the food web are patterns in energy flow that are governed by thermodynamics, which is the theory of energy exchange between systems. Trophic dynamics relates to thermodynamics because it deals with the transfer and transformation of energy (originating externally from the sun via solar radiation) to and among organisms.

== Energetics and the carbon cycle ==
The first step in energetics is photosynthesis, where in water and carbon dioxide from the air are taken in with energy from the sun, and are converted into oxygen and glucose. Cellular respiration is the reverse reaction, wherein oxygen and sugar are taken in and release energy as they are converted back into carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide and water produced by respiration can be recycled back into plants.

Energy loss can be measured either by efficiency (how much energy makes it to the next level), or by biomass (how much living material exists at those levels at one point in time, measured by standing crop). Of all the net primary productivity at the producer trophic level, in general only 10% goes to the next level, the primary consumers, then only 10% of that 10% goes on to the next trophic level, and so on up the food pyramid. Ecological efficiency may be anywhere from 5% to 20% depending on how efficient or inefficient that ecosystem is. This decrease in efficiency occurs because organisms need to perform cellular respiration to survive, and energy is lost as heat when cellular respiration is performed. That is also why there are fewer tertiary consumers than there are producers.

== Primary production ==
A producer is any organism that performs photosynthesis. Producers are important because they convert energy from the sun into a storable and usable chemical form of energy, glucose, as well as oxygen. The producers themselves can use the energy stored in glucose to perform cellular respiration. Or, if the producer is consumed by herbivores in the next trophic level, some of the energy is passed on up the pyramid. The glucose stored within producers serves as food for consumers, and so it is only through producers that consumers are able to access the sun’s energy. Some examples of primary producers are algae, mosses, and other plants such as grasses, trees, and shrubs.

Chemosynthetic bacteria perform a process similar to photosynthesis, but instead of energy from the sun they use energy stored in chemicals like hydrogen sulfide. This process, referred to as chemosynthesis, usually occurs deep in the ocean at hydrothermal vents that produce heat and chemicals such as hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide and methane. Chemosynthetic bacteria can use the energy in the bonds of the hydrogen sulfide and oxygen to convert carbon dioxide to glucose, releasing water and sulfur in the process. Organisms that consume the chemosynthetic bacteria can take in the glucose and use oxygen to perform cellular respiration, similar to herbivores consuming producers.

One of the factors that controls primary production is the amount of energy that enters the producer(s), which can be measured using productivity. Only one percent of solar energy enters the producer, the rest bounces off or moves through. Gross primary productivity is the amount of energy the producer actually gets. Generally, 60% of the energy that enters the producer goes to the producer’s own respiration. The net primary productivity is the amount that the plant retains after the amount that it used for cellular respiration is subtracted. Another factor controlling primary production is organic/inorganic nutrient levels in the water or soil that the producer is living in.

== Secondary production ==
Secondary production is the use of energy stored in plants converted by consumers to their own biomass. Different ecosystems have different levels of consumers, all end with one top consumer. Most energy is stored in organic matter of plants, and as the consumers eat these plants they take up this energy. This energy in the herbivores and omnivores is then consumed by carnivores. There is also a large amount of energy that is in primary production and ends up being waste or litter, referred to as detritus. The detrital food chain includes a large amount of microbes, macroinvertebrates, meiofauna, fungi, and bacteria. These organisms are consumed by omnivores and carnivores and account for a large amount of secondary production. Secondary consumers can vary widely in how efficient they are in consuming. The efficiency of energy being passed on to consumers is estimated to be around 10%. Energy flow through consumers differs in aquatic and terrestrial environments.

===In aquatic environments===

Heterotrophs contribute to secondary production and it is dependent on primary productivity and the net primary products. Secondary production is the energy that herbivores and decomposers use and thus depends on primary productivity. Primarily herbivores and decomposers consume all the carbon from two main organic sources in aquatic ecosystems, autochthonous and allochthonous. Autochthonous carbon comes from within the ecosystem and includes aquatic plants, algae and phytoplankton. Allochthonous carbon from outside the ecosystem is mostly dead organic matter from the terrestrial ecosystem entering the water. In stream ecosystems, approximately 66% of annual energy input can be washed downstream. The remaining amount is consumed and lost as heat.

===In terrestrial environments===

Secondary production is often described in terms of trophic levels, and while this can be useful in explaining relationships it overemphasizes the rarer interactions. Consumers often feed at multiple trophic levels. Energy transferred above the third trophic level is relatively unimportant. The assimilation efficiency can be expressed by the amount of food the consumer has eaten, how much the consumer assimilates and what is expelled as feces or urine. While a portion of the energy is used for respiration, another portion of the energy goes towards biomass in the consumer. There are two major food chains: The primary food chain is the energy coming from autotrophs and passed on to the consumers; and the second major food chain is when carnivores eat the herbivores or decomposers that consume the autotrophic energy. Consumers are broken down into primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers. Carnivores have a much higher assimilation of energy, about 80% and herbivores have a much lower efficiency of approximately 20 to 50%. Energy in a system can be affected by animal emigration/immigration. The movements of organisms are significant in terrestrial ecosystems. Energetic consumption by herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems has a low range of ~3-7%. The flow of energy is similar in many terrestrial environments. The fluctuation in the amount of net primary product consumed by herbivores is generally low. This is in large contrast to aquatic environments of lakes and ponds where grazers have a much higher consumption of around ~33%. Ectotherms and endotherms have very different assimilation efficiencies.

== Detritivores ==
Detritivores consume organic material that is decomposing and are in turn consumed by carnivores. Predator productivity is correlated with prey productivity. This confirms that the primary productivity in ecosystems affects all productivity following.

Detritus is a large portion of organic material in ecosystems. Organic material in temperate forests is mostly made up of dead plants, approximately 62%.

In an aquatic ecosystem, leaf matter that falls into streams gets wet and begins to leech organic material. This happens rather quickly and will attract microbes and invertebrates. The leaves can be broken down into large pieces called coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM). The CPOM is rapidly colonized by microbes. Meiofauna is extremely important to secondary production in stream ecosystems. Microbes breaking down and colonizing this leaf matter are very important to the detritovores. The detritovores make the leaf matter more edible by releasing compounds from the tissues; it ultimately helps soften them. As leaves decay nitrogen will decrease since cellulose and lignin in the leaves is difficult to break down. Thus the colonizing microbes bring in nitrogen in order to aid in the decomposition. Leaf breakdown can depend on initial nitrogen content, season, and species of trees. The species of trees can have variation when their leaves fall. Thus the breakdown of leaves is happening at different times, which is called a mosaic of microbial populations.

Species effect and diversity in an ecosystem can be analyzed through their performance and efficiency. In addition, secondary production in streams can be influenced heavily by detritus that falls into the streams; production of benthic fauna biomass and abundance decreased an additional 47–50% during a study of litter removal and exclusion.

== Energy flow across ecosystems ==
Research has demonstrated that primary producers fix carbon at similar rates across ecosystems. Once carbon has been introduced into a system as a viable source of energy, the mechanisms that govern the flow of energy to higher trophic levels vary across ecosystems. Among aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, patterns have been identified that can account for this variation and have been divided into two main pathways of control: top-down and bottom-up. The acting mechanisms within each pathway ultimately regulate community and trophic level structure within an ecosystem to varying degrees. Bottom-up controls involve mechanisms that are based on resource quality and availability, which control primary productivity and the subsequent flow of energy and biomass to higher trophic levels. Top-down controls involve mechanisms that are based on consumption by consumers. These mechanisms control the rate of energy transfer from one trophic level to another as herbivores or predators feed on lower trophic levels.

=== Aquatic vs terrestrial ecosystems ===
Much variation in the flow of energy is found within each type of ecosystem, creating a challenge in identifying variation between ecosystem types. In a general sense, the flow of energy is a function of primary productivity with temperature, water availability, and light availability. For example, among aquatic ecosystems, higher rates of production are usually found in large rivers and shallow lakes than in deep lakes and clear headwater streams. Among terrestrial ecosystems, marshes, swamps, and tropical rainforests have the highest primary production rates, whereas tundra and alpine ecosystems have the lowest. The relationships between primary production and environmental conditions have helped account for variation within ecosystem types, allowing ecologists to demonstrate that energy flows more efficiently through aquatic ecosystems than terrestrial ecosystems due to the various bottom-up and top-down controls in play.

==== Bottom-up ====
The strength of bottom-up controls on energy flow are determined by the nutritional quality, size, and growth rates of primary producers in an ecosystem. Photosynthetic material is typically rich in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and supplements the high herbivore demand for N and P across all ecosystems. Aquatic primary production is dominated by small, single-celled phytoplankton that are mostly composed of photosynthetic material, providing an efficient source of these nutrients for herbivores. In contrast, multi-cellular terrestrial plants contain many large supporting cellulose structures of high carbon but low nutrient value. Because of this structural difference, aquatic primary producers have less biomass per photosynthetic tissue stored within the aquatic ecosystem than in the forests and grasslands of terrestrial ecosystems. This low biomass relative to photosynthetic material in aquatic ecosystems allows for a more efficient turnover rate compared to terrestrial ecosystems. As phytoplankton are consumed by herbivores, their enhanced growth and reproduction rates sufficiently replace lost biomass and, in conjunction with their nutrient dense quality, support greater secondary production.

Additional factors impacting primary production includes inputs of N and P, which occurs at a greater magnitude in aquatic ecosystems. These nutrients are important in stimulating plant growth and, when passed to higher trophic levels, stimulate consumer biomass and growth rate. If either of these nutrients are in short supply, they can limit overall primary production. Within lakes, P tends to be the greater limiting nutrient while both N and P limit primary production in rivers. Due to these limiting effects, nutrient inputs can potentially alleviate the limitations on net primary production of an aquatic ecosystem. Allochthonous material washed into an aquatic ecosystem introduces N and P as well as energy in the form of carbon molecules that are readily taken up by primary producers. Greater inputs and increased nutrient concentrations support greater net primary production rates, which in turn supports greater secondary production.

==== Top-down ====
Top-down mechanisms exert greater control on aquatic primary producers due to the roll of consumers within an aquatic food web. Among consumers, herbivores can mediate the impacts of trophic cascades by bridging the flow of energy from primary producers to predators in higher trophic levels. Across ecosystems, there is a consistent association between herbivore growth and producer nutritional quality. However, in aquatic ecosystems, primary producers are consumed by herbivores at a rate four times greater than in terrestrial ecosystems. Although this topic is highly debated, researchers have attributed the distinction in herbivore control to several theories, including producer to consumer size ratios and herbivore selectivity.

Modeling of top-down controls on primary producers suggests that the greatest control on the flow of energy occurs when the size ratio of consumer to primary producer is the highest. The size distribution of organisms found within a single trophic level in aquatic systems is much narrower than that of terrestrial systems. On land, the consumer size ranges from smaller than the plant it consumes, such as an insect, to significantly larger, such as an ungulate, while in aquatic systems, consumer body size within a trophic level varies much less and is strongly correlated with trophic position. As a result, the size difference between producers and consumers is consistently larger in aquatic environments than on land, resulting in stronger herbivore control over aquatic primary producers.

Herbivores can potentially control the fate of organic matter as it is cycled through the food web. Herbivores tend to select nutritious plants while avoiding plants with structural defense mechanisms. Like support structures, defense structures are composed of nutrient poor, high carbon cellulose. Access to nutritious food sources enhances herbivore metabolism and energy demands, leading to greater removal of primary producers. In aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton are highly nutritious and generally lack defense mechanisms. This results in greater top-down control because consumed plant matter is quickly released back into the system as labile organic waste. In terrestrial ecosystems, primary producers are less nutritionally dense and are more likely to contain defense structures. Because herbivores prefer nutritionally dense plants and avoid plants or plant parts with defense structures, a greater amount of plant matter is left unconsumed within the ecosystem. Herbivore avoidance of low-quality plant matter may be why terrestrial systems exhibit weaker top-down control on the flow of energy.

<doc id="321387" wikidata="Q217015" url="?curid=321387" title="Leap year starting on Wednesday">
<text>A leap year starting on Wednesday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Wednesday 1 January and ends on Thursday 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are ED. The most recent year of such kind was 2020, and the next one will be 2048 in the Gregorian calendar, or likewise, 2004 and 2032 in the obsolete Julian calendar, see below for more.

Any leap year that starts on Wednesday has two Friday the 13ths: those two in this leap year occur in March and November. Common years starting on Thursday share this characteristic, but also have another in February.

Leap years starting on Sunday also share a similar characteristic to this type of leap year, three Friday the 13th&#x27;s have a three month gap between them, the former two being in the common year preceding this type of leap year, those being September and December, and the latter being in this type of year, that being March. Leap years starting on Sunday share this by having January, April and July three months apart from each other.

This is the only leap year with three occurrences of Friday the 17th: those three in this leap year occur three months (13 weeks) apart: in January, April, and July. Common years starting on Sunday share this characteristic, in the months of February, March, and November.

From August of the common year preceding that year until October in this type of year is also the longest period (14 months) that occurs without a Tuesday the 13th, as in 2019-20. Common years starting on Saturday share this characteristic, from July of the year that precedes it to September in that type of year.

==Calendars==

==Applicable years==
===Gregorian Calendar===
Leap years that begin on Wednesday, along with those starting on Tuesday, occur at a rate of approximately 14.43% (14 out of 97) of all total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Thus, their overall occurrence is 3.5% (14 out of 400).

For this kind of year, the corresponding ISO year has 53 weeks.

===Julian Calendar===
Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Wednesday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700 years, i.e. 25 cycles. The year&#x27;s position in the cycle is given by the formula ((year + 8) mod 28) + 1).

<doc id="321396" wikidata="Q648394" url="?curid=321396" title="Chevrolet Avalanche">
<text>The Chevrolet Avalanche is a four-door, five- or six-passenger pickup truck that was manufactured by General Motors. The Avalanche was a hybrid between the Chevrolet Suburban SUV and the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, sharing the chassis with the Suburban. Unlike a typical pickup truck where the bed is mounted separately from the cab on the frame, the bed of the Avalanche was integrated with the cab body.

It also featured a &quot;midgate&quot; behind the second row of seats that could be folded down, with the seats, to create a longer bed area. The Avalanche was produced across two generations starting in 2001 and ending in 2013.

Breaking with a long-standing tradition, the Avalanche was not available as a GMC, but only as a Chevrolet. Instead, Cadillac would sell a re-badged Avalanche; however, the midgate design would be adapted for use on the GMC Envoy XUV and Hummer H2 SUT.


== First generation (2001–2006) ==

The Avalanche was launched in September 2001 as a 2002 model on the GMT800 platform. First year Avalanches featured light gray plastic body cladding, intended to provide visual distinction from the Suburban/Yukon XL. The Avalanche also gave the public an advance look at the next generation of front fascia designs for the entire GM line. A full-length chrome strip splits each lamp assembly and the grille, with a gold Chevrolet &quot;bow tie&quot; in the center. The hood and fenders featured aggressive folds, in contrast to the softer designs seen on other models built on the GMT800 platform.

Avalanche was nominated for the &quot;North American SUV of the Year&quot; award and was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Truck of the Year for 2002.

The Avalanche was originally marketed as being able to &quot;change from an SUV to a super SUV.&quot; This was made possible by a plastic cover and an exclusive &quot;midgate,&quot; called the Convert-a-Cab system by GM, which could open and close. The midgate was a divider behind the second row of seats that could be folded down, with the seats, to create a longer bed area, or folded up to make a larger cab area. A similar midgate was found on the Cadillac Escalade EXT (a rebadged Avalanche), Hummer H2 SUT, and GMC Envoy XUV.

The truck was offered as a half-ton 1500 series with a Vortec 5.3L V8 producing 285 hp (216 kW) or as a three-quarter-ton 2500 series with a Vortec 8.1L V8 with 340 hp (253 kW) and the 4L85-E four-speed transmission. The base layout is rear-wheel drive, but there is an available with selectable high/low four-wheel drive. Avalanche 2500 models from 2004–2006 were exclusively available with four-wheel drive.

For those who planned to go off-road in their Avalanche, a Z71 Off-Road package was available that added features such as off-road suspension, GM&#x27;s AutoTrac full-time push-button four-wheel-drive system, all-terrain P265/70R17 white-lettered Goodyear tires, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces with waterproof accents, front dual power bucket seats, cloth door panel inserts, GM&#x27;s OnStar telematics system, all-weather rubber floor mats, Chevrolet bowtie emblems embedded into the backrests of the seats (for 2002 models), dual-zone automatic climate controls with rear HVAC vents and remote controls, remote radio controls with headphone jacks for two pairs of headphones, a security system, gray-finished side running boards, power-adjustable, heated side-view mirrors, SRS side impact airbags. Aside from these details, a Z71 Off-Road decal on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. Full leather seating surfaces were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

For those who preferred the styling of the Z71 Off-Road package but did not plan to take their Avalanche off-road, a Z66 Premium On-Road package was also available. The Z66 On-Road package featured all the equipment that the Z71 Off-Road package offered but replaced the off-road suspension with sport on-road suspension and did not offer four-wheel drive. Aside from these details, a Z66 On-Road sticker on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. As with the Z71 Off-Road package, full leather seating surfaces without the cloth accents were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

To further distinguish it from its Silverado siblings, the Avalanche was practically fully equipped and only came with bodyside cladding. The Avalanche included features such as 16-inch alloy wheels and tires (chromed steel on the 2500 model), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and six speakers, cloth seating surfaces, front bench seat with power front driver&#x27;s seat, power windows, power door locks, keyless entry, full instrumentation, dual front airbags, and air conditioning. Options included OnStar telematics system, cassette player, leather seating surfaces, front dual power bucket seats that could be heated, and side airbags for the front seats. A North Face Edition, in partnership with the North Face brand included limited exterior color options, a unique Ebony/Green leather interior, special exterior ornamentation and decals, white-faced gauges, OnStar telematics system, specially colored door panel inserts and speaker grilles, and more.

For 2003, the Avalanche was slightly changed. 2003 models featured a darker cladding, but GM&#x27;s new president, Rick Wagoner, demanded the removal of this &quot;unpopular&quot; trim (as did certain elements of the public). From mid-year, Avalanche could be ordered without cladding. The uncladded model, known as &quot;Without Body Hardware&quot; (or its initialism &quot;WBH,&quot; which is also an RPO code), and alternatively called &quot;slicksides&quot; by GM marketers, resembled the 2003–2005 Silverado 1500 in the front. A new interior—shared with the Tahoe and Suburban—added a new, larger steering wheel with subsequent audio, cruise, and speed controls; an optional six-speaker premium Bose sound system with external amplifier; a new gauge cluster with information center and memory for the front driver&#x27;s seat, brake and accelerator pedals, and side-view mirror position (on some models); new radio head units, which included an AM/FM stereo with either a single-disc or six-disc CD/MP3 changer, Radio Data System, and optional XM Satellite Radio; standard OnStar telematics system with steering wheel controls; new warning chimes that played through the vehicle&#x27;s audio system instead of through a separate speaker behind the dashboard; and newly available 17-inch alloy wheels and tires. Optional features included rear audio controls with headphone jacks and a rear DVD entertainment system by Panasonic with wireless headphones. The WBH option was only available in the 1500 series.

===Avalanche Base Camp Concept (1999)===

A pre-production version of the Avalanche was shown as the Avalanche Base Camp Concept. The truck, which carried the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of 1GCFK13U32X4618EX, was painted in &quot;Bright Yellow Clear Coat&quot;, and featured a &quot;Neutral&quot; cloth interior with contrasting yellow trim on the seats and Chevrolet Bowtie emblems on the seatbacks, speaker grilles, and door panels, as well as Cadillac Escalade–style wood trim on the instrument panel. The truck was powered by the 6.0L Vortec V8 gasoline engine, which was not offered on the production Avalanche. In addition, the Avalanche Base Camp Concept featured unique accessories that were not available on the production truck, such as a Bose premium audio system, which included a bass module (subwoofer) and bedside-mounted speakers; a unique roof rack; a rear DVD entertainment system with three LCD monitors; dual Nokia 5125 cellular phones with color-coordinated yellow faceplates; a &quot;keyless&quot; ignition system that included a push-button to start; a battery cutoff switch (for show purposes); a trailer hitch-mounted cooler; a unique front brush guard and side running boards; a bed painted to match the interior of the vehicle; a Diamond-Plate tailgate liner; a bed-mounted LCD screen; &quot;Avalanche Base Camp&quot; embossing on the body side cladding; and a mobile cooking stove and sink, among other accessories. The vehicle was sold at the 2006 Barrett-Jackson collector car auction in Palm Beach, Florida, for $20,900 (). It was later listed with 2,000 miles on the Cars &amp; Bids online auction website in July 2023.

===Cladding issues===
Soon after the release of the Chevrolet Avalanche, customers began to notice cosmetic issues with the cladding on their vehicles. Over time, exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance. It was especially noticeable on the cargo bed panels, and sail-panel windows where &quot;zebra striping&quot; would appear. Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one-time treatment of a product called ArmorDillo. This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about six months; thereafter, it would wear off and need to be re-applied. Realizing this was not a permanent solution, GM, together with Gatorback Coatings, developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like-new shine. This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new layer of tinted acrylic over the faded plastic. Customers within the original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored. General Motors did not use side body cladding on the second-generation model.

== Second generation (2007–2013) ==
The second generation Avalanche was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2006. Production of the redesigned Avalanche, built on the GMT900 platform, began at the Silao Assembly plant in April 2006. The Avalanche maintained the styled front end much like its sister vehicles, the Tahoe/Yukon and Suburban/Yukon XL, yet it still had the distinct midgate and integrated bed as found on the previous incarnation. It had all the same standard and available features as the Suburban and the Tahoe. The 2500 model of the previous generation was discontinued.

A special Z71 package was offered for the second-generation Avalanche, available on the LT trim with either the 2LT or 3LT option groups. This off-road package consisted of a suspension tuned for rough terrain, an exclusive automatic-locking rear differential, aluminum under-body skid plates (visible from the front of the truck), wheel flares, badges, wheels, and tires.

For the first time, the steering system was switched from the traditional recirculating-ball to a rack-and-pinion also found in the Tahoe and Suburban 1500. Later models introduced another version of the Vortec 5.3-liter V8 as the engine is now capable of running on E85 ethanol. On normal gasoline, it produces and of torque, whereas on E85, its output rises to and of torque, up from and in 2009.

A 2007 Avalanche was given away to the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Michael Young.

For the 2009 model year, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system was added to all Avalanche models, and was integrated with the vehicle&#x27;s OnStar telematics system, and the 4L60-E four-speed automatic transmission was replaced with the 6L80-E unit for both engines.

Following the 2009 model year, the 6.0L V8 engine option was dropped from the Avalanche lineup (in addition to being discontinued from the related Chevrolet Suburban 1500 and Chevrolet Tahoe), leaving the standard 5.3L V8 as the Avalanche&#x27;s sole engine option.

===Trim levels===

The second-generation Avalanche came in three well-equipped trim levels:

* The LS served as the base model. Among the included features were 17-inch alloy wheels and tires, cloth seating surfaces, power front driver&#x27;s bucket seat, OnStar telematics system, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, keyless entry, and black door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, aluminum interior trim, front and side airbags, traction control, and StabiliTrak. A Bluetooth hands-free phone system was added starting with the 2009 model year.
* The LT served as the mid-level model. It added power dual front bucket seats, remote start, XM Satellite Radio, Bluetooth hands-free telephone system, and exterior color-keyed door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, wood interior trim, as well as other features. Later models also included leather seating surfaces with heated front seats, and a Bose premium audio system with an amplifier and subwoofer. A Bluetooth hands-free phone system was added starting with the 2009 model year.
* The LTZ was the top-of-the-line model. It added leather seating surfaces, security alarm, an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3/DVD changer, an eight-speaker premium Bose CenterPoint amplified surround sound system, memory for the front driver&#x27;s seat, 20-inch polished alloy wheels and tires, and rear seat audio and video system controls, and the trim-exclusive self-leveling Auto Ride suspension. Later models also included a touchscreen GPS navigation system with SiriusXM Travel Link Services, and a rear backup camera system. A Bluetooth hands-free phone system was added starting with the 2009 model year.

===Black Diamond Edition===

For the 2013 model year, all three trim levels of the Avalanche were sold as special-edition Black Diamond Edition models to commemorate the final year of production. While options and packages were virtually unchanged from the 2012 model year, all 2013 Avalanches received special &quot;Black Diamond Edition&quot; badging on the rear pillars and rear tailgate, and buyers also received a personalized coffee table book shipped to them after purchase that included a copy of their Avalanche&#x27;s window sticker, as well as a letter from Chevrolet congratulating them on their purchase. The book included information about the development of the original 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche, as well as &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; photos from Silao Assembly showing the Avalanche being assembled, and Avalanche owners&#x27; photos of their trucks.

===Discontinuation===
Production of the Avalanche ended after the 2013 model year, after 2011 saw a sales decline of 2.6% to 20,088 units. Production of the Cadillac Escalade EXT also ended after the 2013 model year.

<text>The pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba) () is a species of bird in the auk family, Alcidae. One of three species in the genus &quot;Cepphus&quot;, it is most closely related to the spectacled guillemot. There are five subspecies of the pigeon guillemot; all subspecies, when in , are dark brown with a black iridescent sheen and a distinctive wing patch broken by a brown-black wedge. Its has mottled grey and black and white . The long bill is black, as are the claws. The legs, feet, and inside of the mouth are red. It closely resembles the black guillemot, which is slightly smaller and lacks the dark wing wedge present in the pigeon guillemot. 

This seabird is found on North Pacific coastal waters, from Siberia through Alaska to California. The pigeon guillemot breeds and sometimes roosts on rocky shores, cliffs, and islands close to shallow water. In the winter, some birds move slightly south in the northernmost part of their range in response to advancing ice and migrate slightly north in the southern part of their range, generally preferring more sheltered areas.

This species feeds on small fish and marine invertebrates, mostly near the sea floor, that it catches by pursuit diving. Pigeon guillemots are monogamous breeders, nesting in small colonies close to the shore. They defend small territories around a nesting cavity, in which they lay one or two eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. After leaving the nest the young bird is completely independent of its parents. Several birds and other animals prey on the eggs and chicks.

The pigeon guillemot is considered to be a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to its large, stable population and wide range. Threats to this bird include climate change, introduced mammalian predators, and oil spills.

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
The pigeon guillemot is one of three species of auk in the genus &quot;Cepphus&quot;, the other two being the black guillemot of the Atlantic Ocean and the spectacled guillemot from the Eastern Pacific. It was described in 1811 by Peter Simon Pallas in the second volume of his &quot;Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica&quot;. A 1996 study looking at the mitochondrial DNA of the auk family found that the genus &quot;Cepphus&quot; is most closely related to the murrelets from the genus &quot;Synthliboramphus&quot;. An alternative arrangement, proposed in 2001 using genetic and morphological comparisons, found them as a sister clade to the murres, razorbill, little auk and great auk. Within the genus, the pigeon guillemot and spectacled guillemot are sister species, and the black guillemot is basal within the genus. The pigeon guillemot and the black guillemot form a superspecies.

There are five recognised subspecies of the pigeon guillemot:
* &quot;Cepphus columba columba&quot; – northeast Siberia through the Bering Sea
* &quot;C. c. snowi&quot; – northern &amp; central Kuril Islands
* &quot;C. c. kaiurka&quot; – Commander Islands to west-central Aleutian Islands
* &quot;C. c. adiantus&quot; – central Aleutian Islands to Washington
* &quot;C. c. eureka&quot; – Oregon &amp; California

In the binomial name, the genus, &quot;Cepphus&quot;, is derived from the Greek &quot;kepphos&quot;, referring to an unknown pale waterbird mentioned by Aristotle among other classical writers, later variously identified as types of seabirds, including gulls, auks and gannets. The specific epithet, &quot;columba&quot;, is derived both from the Icelandic &quot;klumba&quot;, meaning &quot;auk&quot;, and the Latin &quot;columba&quot;, meaning &quot;pigeon&quot;. Pallas noted in his description of this species that the common name for the related black guillemot was Greenland dove. &quot;Snowi&quot; is dedicated to Captain Henry James Snow, a British seaman and hunter. The name of the subspecies &quot;kaiurka&quot; is derived from the Russian &quot;kachurka&quot;, meaning &quot;petrel&quot;. &quot;Adiantus&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;adiantos&quot;, &quot;unwetted&quot;. The trinomial epithet of the subspecies &quot;C. c. eureka&quot; is from the motto of the state of California, which is derived from the Greek &quot;heurēka&quot;, meaning &quot;I have found it&quot;.

==Description==

The pigeon guillemot is a medium-sized auk, in length and weighing . Both sexes are alike in appearance and mass, except for Californian birds where females were found to have larger bills than males. The summer or of the adult is mostly dark brown with a black sheen, with a white wing patch broken by a brown-black wedge. In winter, the are iridescent black, often with black fringes giving a scalloped appearance, and the and rump are white. The forehead, , , eye line and ear coverts are black with white tips, sometimes the tips are narrow and the head looks black. In all plumages, the are plain and dark. Adults moult into their winter or between August and October, taking around a month to complete and leaving the bird unable to fly for around four weeks. Birds moult into their breeding plumage between January and March. The legs and feet are red, with black claws. The iris is brown and the eye is surrounded by a thin unbroken white eye-ring. The bill is long and black and the inside of the mouth is red.
The juvenile pigeon guillemot resembles a winter adult but has underpart feathers tipped in brown, giving the appearance of barring, more brown feathers in the upperparts and its wing patch is smaller. Its legs are a grey-brown in color. It loses the brown underpart feathers after its first moult two to three months after fledging. Its moult to its first summer plumage is later than adults, happening between March and May, and first summer birds lack the glossy sheen of adults.

The differences between the subspecies are based on body measurements such as the and wing length. These are larger in southern subspecies and smaller further north. The amount of white on the outer and increases in northern subspecies, except for &quot;Cepphus columba snowi&quot;, where the white is reduced or entirely absent.

The pigeon guillemot walks well and habitually has an upright posture. When sitting it frequently rests on its tarsi. The wings of the pigeon guillemot are shorter and rounder than other auks, reflecting greater adaptation towards diving than flying. It has difficulty taking off in calm conditions without a runway, but once in the air it is faster than the black guillemot, having been recorded at , about faster than the black guillemot. In the water it is a strong swimmer on the surface using its feet. When diving, propulsion is provided both by the wings, which beat at a rate of 2.1/s, but unusually for auks also by the feet. Pigeon guillemots have been recorded travelling horizontally on dives.

The pigeon guillemot is similar to the related black guillemot, but can be distinguished by its larger size, and in the breeding season by its dusky-grey underwing and the dark brown wedge on the white wing patch.

==Distribution and habitat==

The pigeon guillemot ranges across the Northern Pacific, from the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia to coasts in western North America from Alaska to California. This bird&#x27;s wintering range is more restricted than its breeding season range, the pigeon guillemot usually wintering at sea or on the coasts, from the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands to Hokkaido and southern California. In Alaska, some migrate south because of advancing sea-ice, although others remain in ice leads or ice holes some distance from the edge of the ice sheet. Further south, birds banded in the Farallon Islands in central California have been recorded moving north, as far as Oregon and even British Columbia. It generally is philopatric, meaning it returns to the colony where it hatched to breed, but it sometimes moves long distances after fledging before settling, for example a chick ringed in the Farallones was recorded breeding in British Columbia.

This bird&#x27;s breeding habitats are rocky shores, cliffs, and islands close to shallow water less than deep. It is flexible about its breeding site location, the important factor being protection from predators, and it is more commonly found breeding on offshore islands than coastal sea cliffs. In the winter it forages along rocky coasts, often in sheltered coves. Sandy-bottomed water is avoided, presumably because this does not provide the right habitat to feed in. It occasionally can be found further offshore, as far as the continental shelf break. In the Bering Sea and Alaska, it feeds in openings in ice sheets.

==Behaviour==
Pigeon guillemots are generally diurnal, but have been recorded feeding before dawn and after sunset. They typically sleep in loose groups in sheltered waters or on shore close to water. They typically rest spaced apart, but mated pairs rest close together. Bathing and preening can also happen on shore or at sea.

===Breeding===

The pigeon guillemot usually lays its eggs in rocky cavities near water, but it often nests in any available cavity, including caves, disused burrows of other seabirds, and even old bomb casings. It is noted that pigeon guillemots do not inhabit nests with gull eggs, specifically those of the western gull. This guillemot usually retains its nest site, meaning that nest sites are generally used multiple times, although it does not display this behaviour if its mate does not return to breed. The nests are found at a wide range of heights, from about above sea-level. Nesting sites are defended by established pairs, as is a small territory around the nest entrance of between . Both sexes defend the nesting site, although most defence is done by the male.

Foreign eggs in this guillemot&#x27;s nest are generally removed. Nest competition with Cassin&#x27;s auklet is occasional, the pigeon guillemot almost always just removing the eggs, and rarely pithing before removal. On the other hand, larger auk species, tufted puffins and rhinoceros auklets, have been reported evicting pigeon guillemots from their nesting crevices.

This guillemot nests at a variety of densities, ranging from a single individual to dense colonies. The nesting density is generally not affected by predation, although on a very local scale, nesting closer to neighbors has a slight advantage. Colonies are attended during the day and, except for birds incubating or brooding, adults do not remain in the colony at night. Birds usually arrive in the colony in the morning, with counts decreasing after early afternoon, when high tide is. Colony attendance is affected by the tide, more appearing when the tide is higher and less when the tide is lower, probably because the prey this bird feeds on is more accessible during low tide, thus more birds are away from the colony. The counts vary the most before laying, while they are relatively stable during incubation and egg laying.

Pigeon guillemots form long-term pair bonds, the pairs usually reuniting each year, although occasionally pairs divorce. The formation of the pair bond is poorly understood. It is thought that form of play known as &quot;water games&quot;, which involves chasing of birds on and under the water at sea, and duet-trilling may have a function in maintaining the pair bond or act as a prelude to copulation. The red colour of the mouth may also be a sexual signal.

Usually arriving at its breeding range 40 to 50 days before laying starts, the pigeon guillemot breeds from late April to September. During this time, it generally lays a clutch of one or two eggs. The eggs have grey and brown blotches near the larger end of the egg and range in colour from creamy to pale blue-green. They measure on average, but become longer when laid later in the breeding season. Incubated by both sexes, the eggs usually hatch after 26 to 32 days. The chick is continuously by both parents for three days, and then at intervals for another two to four days, after which it is able to control its own body temperature. Both parents are responsible for feeding the chicks, and bring single fish held in the bill throughout the day, but most frequently in the morning.
The chicks usually fledge 34 to 42 days after hatching, although the time taken to fledge has been known to take anywhere from 29 to 54 days. Chicks fledge by leaving the colony and flying to sea, after which they are independent of their parents and receive no post-fledging care. After this, the adult also leaves the colony. Young birds do not breed until at least three years after fledging, with most first breeding at four years of age. While they may not return to breed, two or three year old birds may start attending the breeding colony before they reach sexual maturity, arriving in the colony after the breeding birds. Pigeon guillemots that reach adulthood have an average life-expectancy of 4.5 years, and the oldest recorded individual lived for 14 years.

===Calls and displays===

The pigeon guillemot is a very vocal bird, particularly during the breeding season, and makes several calls, some of which are paired with displays, to communicate with others of its kind. One such display call pairing is the conspicuous hunch-whistle, where the tail is slightly raised, the wings held slightly out and the head thrown back 45-90° while whistling, before snapping back to horizontal. The function of this call is to advertise ownership of a territory. Another call, the trill, denotes ownership over larger distances. Trills can be performed singly or as duets between pairs; if performed as a duet then the call also functions to help reinforce pair bond. Trills are usually given from a resting position, except for the trill-waggle, which has the bird raising its tail, opening its wings and ruffling the feathers of its neck and head, followed by a waggling of its outstretched neck and head. This display is antagonistic in a context where pigeon guillemots are in a group and often is the precursor to an attack. Low whistles are made by unpaired males attempting to attract a mate, and are deeper than hunch-whistles and involve less movement of the head. Other calls made include seeps and cheeps made between mates and screams made in the presence of predators.

===Feeding===

The pigeon guillemot forages by itself or in small groups, diving underwater for food, usually close to shore and during the breeding season within of the colony. It forages at depths from , but it prefers depths between . The dives can range from 10 to 144 seconds, and usually average 87 seconds, with an intermission between dives lasting around 98 seconds. Dives of two to ten seconds are typical when feeding on shoals of sandlance at the water&#x27;s surface. Smaller prey are probably consumed underwater, but larger organisms are brought to the surface to eat after capture.

The pigeon guillemot mostly feeds on benthic prey found at the lowest level in a body of water close to the sea floor, but it also takes some prey from higher in the water column. It mainly eats fish and other aquatic animals. Fish taken include sculpins, sandfish, cod, and capelin; invertebrates include shrimp and crabs like the pygmy rock crab, and even rarely polychaete worms, gastropods, bivalves and squid. The diet varies greatly, based on where the individual bird is, the season, and also from year to year, as ocean conditions change prey availability. For example, invertebrates are more commonly taken in winter. The foraging method used by this species differs from that of auks in other genera. It hangs upside down above the seafloor, probing with its head for prey and using its feet and wings to maintain position. The chick&#x27;s diet varies slightly, with more fish than invertebrates, particularly rockfish (family Sebastidae). Specialization in the prey taken by a pigeon guillemot when foraging for its chicks generally results in greater reproductive success, with a high-lipid diet allowing for more growth.

The adult pigeon guillemot requires about 20% of its own weight, or of food each day. It doubles its rate of fishing when feeding the nestlings. As the nestlings get older, they are fed more, until 11 days after hatching, when the food generally levels out. The food they get, although, starts to decrease about 30 days after hatching.

==Predators and parasites==
Avian predation is the most common cause of egg loss in the pigeon guillemot. Species that prey on the nests include the northwestern crow, a common predator of both eggs and chicks, as well as glaucous-winged gulls, stoats and garter snakes. Raccoons are also common predators, preying on eggs, chicks, and adults. Adults are sometimes hunted by bald eagles, peregrine falcons, great horned owls and northern goshawks. In the water, they have been reported to be taken by orca and giant Pacific octopuses.

This bird, especially its chicks, is vulnerable to &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, a fungal disease, while in captivity. It is also vulnerable to the cestode &quot;Alcataenia campylacantha&quot;. Ticks (&quot;Ixodes uriae&quot;) and fleas (&quot;Ceratophyllus&quot;) have been recorded on chicks as well.

==Status==
The pigeon guillemot is considered to be a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This is due to multiple factors, including its large population, estimated at 470,000 individuals, its stable population, and its large range, as this bird is thought to occur over a range of . This bird is vulnerable to introduced mammalian predators, such as raccoons. The removal of introduced predators from breeding islands allows the species to recover. Climate change has a negative effect on this bird, and reproductive performance decreases with increased temperatures. It is also particularly vulnerable to oil, and adults near oiled shores display symptoms of hepatocellular injury, where elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase can be found in the liver. Otherwise, the effects of oil spills on the pigeon guillemot are unclear. Unlike some seabirds, ingestion of plastic does not seem to be a problem for this species.

<doc id="321407" wikidata="Q5258156" url="?curid=321407" title="Dennis Archer">
<text>Dennis Wayne Archer (born January 1, 1942) is an American lawyer, jurist and former politician from Michigan. A Democrat, Archer served as Justice on the Michigan Supreme Court and as mayor of Detroit. He later served as president of the American Bar Association, becoming the first black president of the organization, which, until 1943, had barred African-American lawyers from membership.

==Early life and education==
Dennis Archer was born on January 1, 1942, to a working-class family living on the east side of Detroit.  His family struggled financially because Archer&#x27;s father lost his arm in an automobile accident. There were few employment opportunities for disabled people in the city, so the family relocated to rural Cassopolis when Archer was five years old.

Archer began working to help provide for his family at just eight years old. He worked as a golf-caddy, pinsetter at a bowling alley, and janitor at a bakery. After graduating high school, Archer financed his college education by painting homes, working at a drug store and becoming the first African-American to work in the Henry Ford Hospital medical records department. Archer began his college education at Wayne State University with the intention of becoming a pharmacist. He later transferred to the Detroit Institute of Technology and then to Western Michigan University.

At Western Michigan University, he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in education. He initially had planned to be a history teacher but later transferred to being a special education teacher at Ralph Bunche Elementary School, located just east of downtown Detroit. From 1965 to 1970, Archer taught disabled children in Detroit Public Schools. He then went on to earn his J.D. from the Detroit College of Law, now the College of Law of Michigan State University, in 1970.

In addition to practicing law in Detroit, Archer was an associate professor at the Detroit College of Law from 1972 to 1978, and an adjunct professor at Wayne State University Law School from 1984 to 1985. He was a member of the board of directors of the Detroit Bar Association and chairman of the association&#x27;s Young Lawyers Section from 1973 to 1975. Archer was also president of three bar associations: The Wolverine Bar Association from 1979 to 1980, the National Bar Association from 1983 to 1984, and the State Bar of Michigan from 1984 to 1985.

==Service on the Michigan Supreme Court==
After a very successful 15-year career as a lawyer, Archer was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court by Governor James Blanchard.  He was only the second black man to sit on that court in Michigan&#x27;s history, ending a nearly twenty-year period without African American presence. Archer served as a justice from 1986 to 1990. During his last year on Michigan Supreme Court, he was named &quot;most respected judge in Michigan&quot; by &quot;Michigan Lawyers Weekly&quot;.

==Detroit mayoralty==
Archer began his campaign for mayor in 1993, running against the very liked Mayor Coleman Young, seeking reelection to serve his sixth term in office. When Mayor Young dropped out of the race due to illness, he gave his endorsement to Sharon McPhail.

Archer ran on a platform of bridging the gap between the suburban and urban populations of Detroit. He also ran on a plank against casinos, a position that put him in line with most city voters and many of the religious leaders in the city. This created distrust among some in the African-American community who feared that Archer would prioritize the needs of whites over their own. Many thought that Archer “was not black enough to be mayor of a city that was about 80 percent African American”.  Archer worked to end this perception by explaining who he represents.  “I stand before you representing the children who are more concerned about surviving the school day... the homeless, the disenfranchised and the working poor who want affordable housing, and a clean and decent place to live”. He emphasized that he was interested in improving life for all city and suburban dwellers, whether they be black, white, Arabic, Jewish, or Hispanic. One of the chief campaign strategists for Archer was David Axelrod.

In November 1993, Archer won the election over McPhail, with votes divided 57 to 43 percent respectively.  According to exit polls Archer won 90 percent of the white vote but only 47 percent of the black vote.

Archer served as mayor of Detroit from 1993 to 2001. During his tenure, he worked to repair the city&#x27;s relations with the Detroit suburbs and the local business community through cooperation with suburban business leaders on their redevelopment plans for the city. One of his major economic contributions to Detroit was attracting the tech giant Compuware to the city. During his tenure the city saw its bond rating upgraded multiple times. When he became mayor the city was still tracking most complex financial processes on file cards. Archer introduced computerization to most city departments. His administration also initiated a work force development program.

In his first term as mayor, Detroit was selected to house an empowerment zone and received other federal benefits which cumulatively brought $100 million to the city. Unemployment also decreased in the city.

Archer was a strong supporter of numerous construction projects in downtown Detroit, including two new stadiums, Ford Field for the Detroit Lions and Comerica Park for the Detroit Tigers. Archer also became president of the National League of Cities during his last year as mayor.

Despite the decrease in crime and unemployment during Archer&#x27;s time as mayor, he was frequently criticized for allegedly not supporting or listening to leaders of the African-American community.  He faced strong opposition when opening three casinos within city limits and not granting any of the three casino licenses to an African American.

Archer was re-elected by a large margin in 1997 but was subject to a recall campaign in his second term, launched by many of his original opponents. He declined to run for reelection in 2001.

==Post-mayoralty==
Upon leaving office as mayor in January 2002, Archer was appointed as chairman of Detroit-based law firm Dickinson Wright, and the board of directors of Compuware.
He is a Fellow of the Litigation Counsel of America.

In 2004, he was appointed to an eight-year term ending December 31, 2012 on the board of trustees of the Western Michigan University by Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. He was appointed legal guardian for Rosa Parks in October 2004.

In February 2008, Archer announced that he was considering running for governor of Michigan in 2010, but ultimately decided not to enter the race the following November.

Archer serves as a co-chair of the National Transportation Policy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

He is currently a member of investment bank Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board.

Archer is an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee, where he serves as a member of the executive committee.

Archer was a superdelegate to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. He supported the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.

On December 1, 2017, Archer released his memoir, &quot;Let the Future Begin,&quot; co-written with Elizabeth Ann Atkins, and published by Atkins &amp; Greenspan Writing.

==Personal life==
Archer is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and of Geometry Lodge #49, F&amp;AM PHA, Prince Hall Freemasonry.

He is Catholic, and attended Gesu Catholic Church during his terms as mayor.

<doc id="321408" wikidata="Q5110227" url="?curid=321408" title="Christian Unity Baptist Association">
<text>The Christian Unity Baptist Association was organized September 27–28, 1935, at Zion Hill Church in Ashe County, North Carolina, by six Baptist congregations. Some of these churches were remnants of the Macedonia Baptist Association, which existed for a short time in the first quarter of the 20th century. These churches had a mixed Missionary Baptist and Primitive Baptist background. Leaders in this new organization included Frank Sturgill, F. Carl Sturgill, and Nancy Owens. 

Though the Christian Unity Association shared much in common with fellow mountain Baptists, they differed from the majority of them in three important points: (1) falling from grace; (2) open communion; and (3) women preachers. Two women preached at the organizational meeting.

The Christian Unity Baptist Association is defunct. This body divided in 1969, and the majority chose to affiliate with the General Association of Separate Baptists. The minority represented continuity with the original constitution and articles of faith. The two surviving churches from that fellowship (Zion Hill &amp; Hooks Branch in Va.), with a combined membership of about 50, no longer hold an associational structure.

<doc id="321409" wikidata="Q1120586" url="?curid=321409" title="Communist Party of Australia">
<text>The Communist Party of Australia (CPA), known as the Australian Communist Party (ACP) from 1944 to 1951, was an Australian communist party founded in 1920. The party existed until roughly 1991, with its membership and influence having been in a steady decline since its peak in 1945. Like most communist parties in the West, the party was heavily involved in the labour movement and the trade unions. Its membership, popularity and influence grew significantly during most of the interwar period before reaching its climax in 1945, where the party achieved a membership of slightly above 22,000 members. At its peak it was the largest communist party in the Anglophone countries on a population basis, and held industrial strength greater than the parties of &quot;India, Latin America, and most of Western Europe&quot;.

Although the party did not achieve a federal MP, Fred Paterson was elected to the Parliament of Queensland (for Bowen) at the 1944 state election. He won re-election in 1947 before the seat was abolished. The party also held office in over a dozen local government areas across New South Wales and Queensland.

After nineteen years of activity, the CPA was formally banned on 15 June 1940 under the relatively new Menzies government (1939–1941). The party was banned under the &quot;National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations 1940&quot;. Two-and-a-half years later, the party was again a lawful organisation. When the party contested the federal election eight months later, it received its biggest vote total. Getting a total of 81,816 votes (1.93–2.00%), the party received over 20,000 in Victoria and Queensland, and over 19,000 in New South Wales. It was the party&#x27;s biggest vote total since the 1934 federal election. However, by the late 1960s the party fell into single digit numbers before a brief spike in the mid 1970s. By the mid to late 1980s, the party was effectively stagnant and the party was soon dissolved. To the present, the party is the fourth-oldest political party in Australian political history since Federation, lasting for .

==History==

===Foundation and early years===

The Communist Party of Australia (CPA) was founded at the Australian Socialist Party Hall in Sydney on 30 October 1920 socialists inspired by reports of the Russian Revolution. The estimates for attendees at the founding ranges from below thirteen (Alistair Davidson) to twenty-six (Stuart Macintyre). Sixty invitations were issued. Groups included the Australian Socialist Party (ASP), some members from the Victorian Socialist Party (although the party itself did not join), as well as a variety of militant trade unionists. Among the party&#x27;s founders were a prominent Sydney trade unionists, Jock Garden, Tom Walsh, and William Paisley Earsman, and suffragettes and anti-conscriptionists including Adela Pankhurst (daughter of the British suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst), Christian Jollie Smith and Katharine Susannah Prichard.

Most of the then illegal Australian section of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) joined, but the IWW soon left the Communist Party, with its original members, over disagreements with the direction of the Soviet Union and Bolshevism. In its early years, mainly through Garden&#x27;s efforts, the party achieved some influence in the trade union movement in New South Wales, but by the mid-1920s it had dwindled to an insignificant group.

A visits to the 1924 New Zealand conference by CPA executive members Hetty and Hector Ross got the (also small) Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ) agreeing to temporary affiliation with the CPA, and were followed by visits in 1925 by Harry Quaife, and by Norman Jeffery a bow-tie wearing former &quot;Wobbly&quot; (IWW member).

Garden and other communists were expelled from the Labor Party (ALP) in 1924. The CPA ran candidates including Garden (for Sydney) at the 1925 New South Wales state election in working-class seats against the ALP but was decisively defeated. This prompted Garden to leave the party in 1926 and return to the Labor Party. The leadership of the party went to Jack Kavanagh, an experienced Canadian communist activist who had moved to Australia in 1925, and Esmonde Higgins, a talented Melbourne journalist who was the nephew of then-High Court Justice, H. B. Higgins.

But in 1929 the party leadership fell into disfavour with the Communist International (Comintern), which under orders from Joseph Stalin had taken a turn to radical revolutionary rhetoric (the so-called &quot;Third Period&quot;), and an emissary, the American communist Harry M. Wicks, was sent to correct the party&#x27;s perceived errors. Kavanagh was expelled in 1930 and Higgins resigned. A new party leadership, consisting of Jack Miles, Lance Sharkey and Richard Dixon, was imposed on the party by the Comintern, and remained in control for the next 30 years. During the 1930s the party experienced some growth, particularly after 1935 when the Comintern changed its policy in favour of a &quot;united front against fascism&quot;. The Movement Against War and Fascism (MAWF) was founded to bring together all opponents of fascism under a communist controlled umbrella organisation. The movement instigated the events which led to the attempted exclusion of Egon Kisch from Australia in late 1934 and early 1935. Alongside this, the CPA formed the Workers Defence Corps (WDC).

In the 1930s, the CPA began a campaign to create mass organisations to organise militancy in the working-class, while ostensibly independent, the CPA remained in control of such organisations. This result in the creation of the Unemployed Workers Movement which at its height had 30,000 members and was infamous nationally for its anti-eviction campaign in Sydney.

The CPA was the first Australian political party to make a commitment to Aboriginal rights, which were included in its manifesto from 1931 onwards. The CPA, discussing in great detail the abuses suffered by Aboriginals, published a lengthy list of demands, calling for &quot;full economic, political and social rights&quot; for Aboriginal people.

===Rise during World War II and the Labor United Front===

The Communist Party began to win positions in trade unions such as the Miners&#x27; Federation and the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation of Australia, although its parliamentary candidates nearly always polled poorly at elections. The party also set up an organization of the unemployed to resist evictions. Activists from the party joined the International Brigades to defend the Second Republic against Francisco Franco&#x27;s troops. Throughout this time, members of the CPA were under constant surveillance by police and intelligence forces and harassed by the courts.

In 1939, after Soviet efforts to contain Nazi aggression through co-operation and alliance with France and Britain were rejected by the French and British, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed a Non-Aggression Treaty. Despite ideological opposition between the countries, the USSR agreed not to engage in hostilities against Germany at the outbreak of World War II (Australia declared war on Nazi Germany for invading Poland). Consequently, the Communist Party of Australia opposed and sought to disrupt Australia&#x27;s war effort against Germany in the early stages of the war under orders of the Comintern on the grounds that it was a war between imperialist nations, and not in the interests of the working class. Menzies banned the CPA after the fall of France in 1940, but by 1941 Stalin was forced to join the allied cause when Hitler reneged on the Pact and invaded the USSR. The USSR came to bear the brunt of the carnage of Hitler&#x27;s war machine and the Communist Party in Australia lost its early war stigma as a result. 

Following the invasion of the Soviet Union, the CPA shifted towards a collaborative United front approach to the Labor Party to fully support the Australian war effort against fascism. Party members held discussions with senior Labor ministers following Curtin government entering office in 1941, pledging to provide full support to mobilise resources for the war effort. The CPA supported calls for conscription, increased working hours, condemned strike action in war industries, and minimised criticism of John Curtin and his government. By 1942, the Curtin government legalised the CPA, exempted communist trade union and party officials from conscription, and provided the party&#x27;s newspaper Tribune with a &#x27;generous newsprint allocation&#x27; under wartime paper rationing.

During the united front period, the CPA&#x27;s membership rose to 20,000, it won control of a number of important trade unions, and a Communist candidate, Fred Paterson, was elected to the Queensland parliament. The Communist Party achieved a majority of seats in the New South Wales&#x27; Kearsley Shire from 1944 to 1947. The Shire was committed to municipal socialism, advocating nationalisation of electricity and the expansion of the social wage, and was unique for its commitment to activism around federal and international affairs. But the party remained marginal to the Australian political mainstream. The Australian Labor Party remained the dominant party of the Australian left.

===Postwar===
After 1945 and the onset of the Cold War, the party entered a steady decline. Following the new line from Moscow, and believing that a new &quot;imperialist war&quot; and a new depression were imminent, and that the CPA should immediately contest for leadership of the working class with the Australian Labor Party, the CPA launched an industrial offensive in 1947, culminating in a prolonged strike in the coal mines in 1949. The Chifley Labor government saw this as a communist challenge to its position in the labour movement, and used the army and strikebreakers to break the strike. The Communist Party never again held such a strong position in the union movement.

In 1949, the USSR detonated its first atomic bomb and Mao Zedong gained control in China. A year later, North Korea invaded South Korea and in 1951, during the Korean War, the Liberal government of Robert Menzies tried to ban the Communist Party of Australia, first by legislation that was declared invalid by the High Court, then by referendum to try to overcome the constitutional obstacles to that legislation. The 1951 referendum was opposed by the Communist Party as well as the Australian Labor Party, and was narrowly defeated. The issue of communist influence in the unions remained potent and led to the Australian Labor Party split of 1955 and the formation of the Democratic Labor Party comprising disaffected ALP members who were concerned over communist influence in Australian unions.

====Internal division and defections====
In 1956, three years after Stalin died, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the Secret Speech, denouncing Stalin and Stalinism as fostering a cult of personality, and revealing many abuses of power Stalin had committed while in power. The Australian party leadership—entirely committed to Stalinism—was confused about what to do. It tried to suppress discussions of the speech, which was widely reported in the press. According to Ralph Gibson, several high-ranking members including Ted Hill had received a copy of Krushchev&#x27;s secret speech directly from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union However, the party denied the criticisms of Stalin within the party newspaper, Tribune.

Disillusioned members began to leave the party. More left after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. In 1961, the leader of the &quot;pro-China&quot; faction of the party during the Sino-Soviet split, Ted Hill, was expelled from the party. Hill proceeded to lead a split of pro-China members of the party, which culminated in the formation of the smaller Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist).

By the 1960s, the party&#x27;s membership had fallen to around 5,000 members, but it continued to hold positions in a number of trade unions, and it was also influential in the various protest movements of the period, especially the movement against the Vietnam War. This period also saw the establishment of the National Training Centre in Minto, NSW, ostensibly for the purpose of educating in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. The party became more openly critical about the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1966, the party started their own magazine called Australian Left Review. In 1967, the party ceased receiving payments from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union following a seminar by Laurie Aarons in the Soviet Union which argued that &quot;ideas require free contest, not confined in a framework of established dogmas that can become a rigid or even ossified edifice&quot;. But the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 triggered another crisis. Sharkey&#x27;s successor as party leader, Laurie Aarons, denounced the invasion, and a group of pro-Soviet hardliners left in 1971 to form a new party, the Socialist Party of Australia.

Through the 1970s and 1980s the party continued to decline, despite adopting Eurocommunism and democratising its internal structures so that it became a looser radical party rather than a classic Marxist-Leninist one. The CPA conducted campaigns against nuclear weapons and the extraction of uranium, and supported the demands of indigenous peoples in Australia and abroad, especially in Papua New Guinea. It thus militated for the abolition of legislation judged repressive regarding indigenous people, for equal pay and for land rights. Its members helped Aboriginal workers in Pilbara lead the longest industrial strike ever in Australia. Internationally, the Communist Party of Australia was close to the Revolutionary Front for the Independence of East Timor (Fretilin) who resisted the Indonesian occupation in the 1970s and 1980s. By 1990, membership had declined to below the one thousand mark.
===Dissolution===
At the party&#x27;s 31st Congress in Sydney (2–3 March 1991), the Communist Party was dissolved and the New Left Party formed. The New Left Party was intended to be a broader party which would attract a wider range of members, which did not happen, and the New Left Party disbanded in 1992. The assets of the Communist Party were thereafter directed into the SEARCH Foundation (acronym for &quot;Social Education, Action and Research Concerning Humanity&quot;), a not-for-profit company set up in 1990 &quot;to preserve and draw on the resources of the Communist Party of Australia and its archives.&quot; The archives of the party are now held at the State Library of NSW and can be accessed with the written permission of the SEARCH Foundation. The State Library of New South Wales holds an extensive collection of material related to the Communist Party of Australia including oral history recordings, business papers, the personal papers of a range of men and women involved in the Party and a collection of images that were published in &quot;Tribune&quot;, the Party&#x27;s newspaper. The Victoria University Library holds the Crow Collection, donated by long-time Communist Party member Ruth Crow, which includes materials from her years campaigning for the Communist Party. The University of Melbourne collection is &quot;one of the most significant from the CPA held in Australia&quot;, containing 20th-century materials from the Victorian branch.

====Successor Party====
In 1996 at the 8th National Congress the Socialist Party of Australia was renamed to Communist Party of Australia, thereby becoming the successor of the original party.

====Search Foundation====

The SEARCH Foundation is a left-wing Australian not-for-profit company that was established in 1990 as a successor organisation of the Communist Party of Australia to preserve and draw on its resources and archives. It inherited over 3 million dollars from the CPA.

SEARCH is an active membership-based organisation that runs speaking tours, publications and training programs. Members are welcome from across the Australian Left and include prominent political figures such as Australian Council of Trade Unions Secretary Sally McManus, and former NSW Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon. SEARCH maintains an office at Sydney Trades Hall and holds events across Australia. Its archives are held by the State Library of NSW.

SEARCH is an acronym for &quot;Social Education, Action and Research Concerning Humanity&quot;.

==Youth movement==

Its youth wing worked under several different names at different times, including the Young Communist League (YCL); the Young Comrades Club (YCC); the League of Young Democrats (LYD); the Eureka Youth League (EYL); and lastly the Young Socialist League, which in 1984 became part of the Left Alliance.

The youth wing of CPA worked under several different names in different periods from the 1920s onwards, including the Young Communist League (YCL), which was created in 1923 and published its own newspaper, &quot;The Young Worker&quot;, and the Young Comrades Club (YCC), founded in 1927. At a meeting in Melbourne in 1937 attended by 1,500 people, the YCL changed its name to the League of Young Democrats (LYD). After the LYD was banned by the Menzies government in 1941, the Eureka Youth League (EYL) was established in December of that year, whose membership grew to 1,000 with a year. The EYL published a newspaper called &quot;Youth Voice&quot;, and undertook activities relating to World War II and the working and living conditions of young people, as well as the peace movement during this war and the Korean War later. In 1952 it held the &quot;Youth Carnival for Peace and Friendship&quot; in Sydney, attracting 30,000 attendees. EYL opposed the introduction of National Service in Australia in the 1950s.

The Eureka Youth League also had an important role in the early promotion of jazz music in Australia in the 1940s under the leadership of Harry Stein.

EYL collaborated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and helped to arrange its Youth Weeks, and also ran youth camps across Australia, attended by thousands of young people. It protested the Vietnam War actively, but by 1968 membership had declined, and a change of name to the Young Socialist League did not last long.

Camp Eureka, created in 1973, is still maintained as an historic and usable camp for up to 32 people.

The Eureka Youth League was a founding member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, a membership later taken over by the Young Communist Movement. In 1984 (or 1987?) the Young Socialist League became part of Left Alliance.

== Early life ==


De Hoop Scheffer attended the Ignatius Gymnasium in Amsterdam from March 1961 until April 1966 and applied at the Leiden University in June 1968 majoring in Law and obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree in June 1970 before graduating with a Master of Laws degree in July 1974. De Hoop Scheffer was conscripted in the Royal Netherlands Air Force serving as a Second lieutenant from August 1974 until September 1976. De Hoop Scheffer worked as a civil servant for the Diplomatic service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from October 1976 until June 1986 as an Attaché in Accra, Ghana from October 1976 until April 1978 and in Brussels, Belgium for the NATO delegation from April 1978 until December 1980 and as secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs from December 1980 until June 1986.

== Political career ==
=== Member of the House of Representatives ===
De Hoop Scheffer was a member of the social liberal Democrats 66 (D66) party from 1979 until 1982 until he became a member of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). In the 1986 general election De Hoop Scheffer was elected to the House of Representatives on 3 June 1986 and served as a frontbencher chairing the parliamentary committees for Development Cooperation and for Foreign Affairs and was spokesperson for foreign affairs, European affairs, NATO, development cooperation and development aid.

=== Leader of Christian Democratic Appeal (1997–2001) ===
After the Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal and Parliamentary leader of the CDA in the House of Representatives Enneüs Heerma announced that he was stepping down as leader and parliamentary leader following increasing criticism on his leadership, the CDA leadership approached De Hoop Scheffer as a candidate to succeed him. De Hoop Scheffer accepted and became leader and parliamentary leader on 27 March 1997.

For the 1998 general election De Hoop Scheffer served as lead candidate and the CDA suffered a loss, losing 5 seats and now had 29 seats in the House of Representatives. On 1 October 2001 De Hoop Scheffer announced that he was stepping down as leader and parliamentary leader following an internal power struggle with the party chairman Marnix van Rij and that he would not stand for the election of 2002.

=== Dutch Foreign Minister ===
The CDA won in the 2002 general elections and played the leading role in the formation of a new coalition government. The new Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende appointed De Hoop Scheffer as foreign minister in his short-lived first cabinet, a position he retained in the second Balkenende cabinet after the elections of 22 January 2003.

In 2003, the foreign policy of the Netherlands was largely determined by De Hoop Scheffer and Balkenende. Its main foreign policy decision was to contribute to Operation Iraqi Freedom, although its formulation (&quot;political&quot; but not &quot;military&quot; support) gave it an ambivalent character. However, 1,100 Dutch servicemen were deployed as part of the Stabilisation Force Iraq in the southern province of Al Muthanna from 2003 till 2005, and two of them were killed in action.

In 2003 Jaap de Hoop Scheffer was also the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

=== NATO Secretary General (2004–2009) ===
He became the 11th Secretary General of NATO on 5 January 2004, succeeding Lord Robertson, who held the post from 1999 until 2003. The announcement was made on 22 September 2003. As Secretary General, De Hoop Scheffer urged NATO members to contribute more to NATO operations such as the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. He &quot;informed a NATO conference that &#x27;NATO troops have to guard pipelines that transport oil and gas that is directed for the West,&#x27; and more generally to protect sea routes used by tankers and other &#x27;crucial infrastructure&#x27; of the energy system&quot;.

On 21 June 2007, De Hoop Scheffer attended an economic conference in Montreal where he encouraged Canada to continue its military mission in Afghanistan past its 2009 withdrawal date. He said, &quot;I think more time is necessary to create those conditions for reconstruction and development to go on.&quot; His visit coincided with the death of three more Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan. &quot;I know how dramatic it is if Canadian soldiers pay the highest price, but I still say, you are there for a good cause.&quot; De Hoop Scheffer&#x27;s comments were made as the Harper government was under pressure by opposition politicians to define the length of Canada&#x27;s commitment to the mission in Afghanistan.

It has been alleged by Iran that Jaap de Hoop Scheffer met Jundallah leader Abdolmalek Rigi while he was visiting Afghanistan in 2008 amid Iranian accusations that the CIA was backing the terrorist group. This accusation was later denied by NATO.

On 21 July 2009 De Hoop Scheffer suffered a heart attack. He underwent angioplasty after which he was reported to be in stable condition.

His successor, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, took office on 1 August 2009.

== Post-political career ==

<text>The Zizhi Tongjian (1084) is a chronicle published during the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) that provides a record of Chinese history from 403 BC to 959 AD, covering 16 dynasties and spanning almost 1400 years. The main text is arranged into 294 scrolls (), each equivalent to a chapter—totaling around 3 million Chinese characters.

In 1065, Emperor Yingzong of Song commissioned his official, Sima Guang (1019–1086), to lead a project to compile a universal history of China, and granted him funding and the authority to appoint his own staff. His team took 19 years to complete the work and in 1084 it was presented to Emperor Yingzong&#x27;s successor Emperor Shenzong of Song. It was well-received and has proved to be immensely influential among both scholars and the general public. Endymion Wilkinson regards it as reference quality: &quot;It had an enormous influence on later Chinese historical writing, either directly or through its many abbreviations, continuations, and adaptations. It remains an extraordinarily useful first reference for a quick and reliable coverage of events at a particular time&quot;, while Achilles Fang wrote &quot;[Zizhi Tongjian], and its numerous re-arrangements, abridgments, and continuations, were practically the only general histories with which most of the reading public of pre-Republican China were familiar.&quot;

==The text==

The principal text of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; comprises a year-by-year narrative of the history of China over 294 scrolls, sweeping through many Chinese historical periods (Warring States, Qin, Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin and the Sixteen Kingdoms, Southern and Northern dynasties, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties), supplemented with two sections of 30 scrolls each—&#x27;tables&#x27; () and &#x27;critical analysis&#x27; ().

Sima Guang departed from the format used in traditional Chinese dynastic histories, consisting primarily of &#x27;annals&#x27; () of rulers and &#x27;biographies&#x27; () of officials. Instead, Sima shifted from a &#x27;biographical style&#x27; () to a &#x27;chronological style&#x27; (). Guang wrote in a memorandum to the Emperor:
Since I was a child I have ranged through histories. It has appeared to me that in the annal-biography form the words are so diffuse and numerous that even an erudite scholar who reads them, again and again, cannot comprehend and sort them out. ... I have constantly wished to write a chronological history roughly in accordance with the form of the Tso-chuan (), starting with the Warring States and going down to the Five Dynasties, drawing on other books besides the Official Histories and taking in all that a ruler ought to know—matters which are related to the rise and fall of dynasties and connected with the joys and sorrows of the people, and of which the good can become a model and the evil a warning.

Initially, Sima Guang hired Liu Shu () and Zhao Junxi as his main assistants, but Zhao was soon replaced by Liu Ban (), a Han history expert. In 1070 Emperor Shenzong approved Guang&#x27;s request to add Fan Zuyu (), a Tang history expert. Because the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; is a distillation from 322 disparate sources, the selection, drafting, and editing processes used in creating the work as well as potential political biases of Sima Guang, in particular, have been the subject of academic debate.

== Derivative and commented works ==
In the 12th century, Zhu Xi produced a reworked, condensed version of the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, known as the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian Gangmu&quot;. This version was itself later translated into Manchu as , upon the request of the Qing Kangxi Emperor. This Manchu version was itself translated into French by Jesuit missionary Joseph-Anne-Marie de Moyriac de Mailla. His 12-volume translation &#x27; (1777–1783) was published posthumously in Paris. The condensed Zizhi Tongjian Gangmu was also the main source for &#x27;, a political history of China from antiquity to 906, published in 1929 by the French Jesuit missionary Léon Wieger.

The Zhonghua Book Company edition contains textual criticism made by Yuan dynasty historian Hu Sanxing. The philosopher Wang Fuzhi also wrote a commentary on &quot;Tongjian&quot;, titled &quot;Comments After Reading the Tongjian&quot; ().

Historian Rafe de Crespigny has published annotated translations of chapters 44 to 69 in three successive works under the titles &quot;A Century of Cathay&quot; (2022, 1 of 3 volumes published), &quot;Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling&quot; (1989) and &quot;To Establish Peace&quot; (1996), covering 57–220 AD, building upon the publication of Achilles Fang&#x27;s annotated translation of the next ten chapters (70–79) covering up to 265 AD. There are also self-published translations into English of chapters 1–8, covering the years 403–207 BC and some additional sections pertaining to the Xiongnu people.

<text>Xenosaga is a role-playing video game series developed by Monolith Soft and primarily published by Namco. Forming part of the wider &quot;Xeno&quot; metaseries, &quot;Xenosaga&quot; is set in a science fiction universe and follows a group of characters as they face both a hostile alien race called the Gnosis and human factions fighting for control of the Zohar, an artifact connected to a god-like energy called U-DO. Gameplay across the series is similar, with the characters being guided through a linear narrative and fighting enemies using a turn-based combat system. The party fights both on foot and in a variety of mechs.

Tetsuya Takahashi created &quot;Xenosaga&quot; as a spiritual successor to the Square-produced &quot;Xenogears&quot;, for which he founded Monolith Soft with help from Namco; multiple &quot;Xenogears&quot; staff returned, including co-writer Soraya Saga. Following the release of the first game, the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series was given over to new staff with Takahashi both supervising the project and providing the draft scripts. Under the new staff, the original script saw several changes and its planned six-part structure cut down by half. The series made considerable use of Biblical imagery and elements of the works of Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche, with the subtitles of the main trilogy drawing from the works of Nietzsche.

Reception of individual titles has been positive, although journalists have commented that the series was too ambitious. While the first game met with strong sales, the series as a whole was a commercial disappointment. The first game also received both a manga and an , the latter being dubbed and released in North America. Following the end of the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, Takahashi and other team members started a new project to rebuild morale, which became &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;. Characters from &quot;Xenosaga&quot; would go on to appear in multiple crossover games.

==Titles==
===Games===
&quot;Xenosaga&quot; spans five different games sharing a single continuity; the three mainline games for the PlayStation 2, a spin-off and prequel for mobile devices, and a remake of the first two entries in the trilogy for the Nintendo DS. Each title in the trilogy features a subtitle taken from the published work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.

*&quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot; was first released in Japan on February 28, 2002, for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). Its North American release came on February 25, 2003. An international version titled &quot;Xenosaga Episode I Reloaded&quot; was released in Japan on November 20, 2003. The game&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;Der Wille zur Macht&quot;, was taken from the native title of &quot;The Will to Power&quot;, a posthumously published collection of notes written by Friedrich Nietzsche.
*&quot;Xenosaga Episode II&quot; was released on June 24, 2004, in Japan for the PS2. The game was released in North America on February 15, 2005. In Europe, the game was published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe on October 28, 2005. It is the only game to have been released in Europe. The subtitle, &quot;Jenseits von Gut und Böse&quot;, is taken from the native title of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophical novel &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;.
*&quot;&quot; was released across three episodes between July and October 2004 for Vodafone mobile devices. A version for NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s i-mode service was released on July 5, 2006. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; remains exclusive to Japan. Its subtitle is inspired by the German fable of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.
*&quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; was released in Japan on March 30, 2006, for the Nintendo DS. The game is a remake of &quot;Episode I&quot; and &quot;Episode II&quot;, with redrawn artwork, gameplay adjusted for a portable platform, and additional story elements based on cut content from the home console versions. Like &quot;Pied Piper&quot;, &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; remains exclusive to Japan.
*&quot;Xenosaga Episode III&quot; was released in Japan on July 6, 2006, for the PlayStation 2 console. It was released in North America on August 29 of the same year, published by the then-rebranded Namco Bandai Games. The game is the last entry to have been released in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series to date. The subtitle, &quot;Also Sprach Zarathustra&quot;, is taken from Nietzsche&#x27;s novel &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;.
===Additional media===
Following the release of &quot;Episode I&quot;, a supplementary disc titled &quot;Xenosaga Freaks&quot; was released on April 28, 2004. The disc features a visual novel segment featuring multiple characters from the game, a minigame dubbed &quot;XenoPitten&quot;, a dictionary that explains the game&#x27;s terminology, and a demo for &quot;Episode II&quot;. &quot;Freaks&quot; was part of a movement with the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series to turn it into a multimedia franchise, with the project growing substantially larger than previously planned. &quot;Xenosaga Episode I&quot; was adapted as a manga by Atsushi Baba and published through &quot;Monthly Comic Zero Sum&quot;. It was later released in three volumes by publisher Ichijinsha between 2004 and 2006. Additionally an anime adaptation titled &quot;&quot;, which adapted the events of the first game, was produced by Toei Animation. Originally broadcast on TV Asahi between January and March 2005. the anime was later licensed and dubbed for a North American release; originally licensed by A.D. Vision, the North American rights are currently held by Funimation Entertainment. Multiple staff from &quot;Xenosaga: The Animation&quot; later worked on &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot;.

==Common elements==
===Gameplay===
Gameplay in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series feature similar gameplay across its various entries. The core gameplay revolves around the player controlling a party of characters navigating different environments including dungeons, with combat initiated when exploring environments and touching sprites representing enemy groups. Combat makes use of a traditional turn-based battle system, with basic mechanics involving the spending or conserving of Action Points (AP). Battles feature combat using both human party members, and in mecha known under different titles in each game. &quot;Episode I&quot; introduces the basic gameplay and combat systems. &quot;Episode II&quot; incorporates multiple levels of attack types which different enemies are weak to, combined with alterations to the performance of mechs. &quot;Episode III&quot; further expands upon the system, and mechs have expanded functions including dedicated dungeon environments. &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; reworks the gameplay systems; combat takes place during random encounters while exploring, and characters are arranged and have elements of their combat dictated by their placement on a grid. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; incorporates gameplay systems similar to &quot;Episode I&quot; adjusted for mobile devices, with navigation separate from battles which take place in a virtual zone tied to the narrative.

===Setting===

The &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series takes place within a single science fiction universe. In the year &quot;20XX&quot;, humanity discovers the Zohar—a primordial artifact which connects to the realm of a god-like energy dubbed U-DO—is discovered on Earth and allows travel beyond the Solar System. A disaster causes Earth&#x27;s location to be lost, becoming known as &quot;Lost Jerusalem&quot;. By the game&#x27;s events, humanity has adopted a new calendar system dubbed &quot;Transcend Christ&quot; (T.C.), with the series&#x27; events beginning in T.C. 4768—equivalent to A.D. 7278, with humanity forming a Galaxy Federation. Planets are connected through a warp travel network called the Unus Mundus Network (U.M.N.), managed by Vector Industries, which also controls interests in the Federation&#x27;s military. Existing alongside humans are Realians, synthetic humans who hold equal status with natural humans. The Federation is attacked by the Gnosis, an ancient species revealed to be formed of souls who rejected U-DO. Vector develops two different weapon systems to fight the Gnosis: humanoid mecha dubbed AGWS (Anti Gnosis Weapon System), and the similar but more powerful KOS-MOS battle androids. There also exist more advanced AGWS models called E.S., powered by Lost Jerusalem artifacts called Vessels of Anima. A key backstory event is the Miltian Conflict, which occurred fourteen years before the events of &quot;Episode I&quot;. Beginning as a war between the U-TIC Organization and the Federation, it escalated when a group of Realians went berserk when an experiment to suppress U-DO&#x27;s energies went wrong. Miltia was lost in a space-time anomaly. Key organizations include the Federation government; the Kukai Foundation, a group that acts as a shelter for enhanced humans including U.R.T.V.s; Vector Industries, a megacorporation controlling the U.M.N.; a splinter faction called the U-TIC Organization; religious cult Ormus, which funds U-TIC; and the Testaments, a group of men who have been granted a form of immortality following their original deaths.

The first game follows series protagonists Shion Uzuki and prototype battle android KOS-MOS escaping a Gnosis attack and traveling to Second Miltia aboard the passenger freighter &quot;Elsa&quot;, where they meet a young man called chaos. Together with U.R.T.V. and Kukai co-founder Jr., the group thwart the plans of Albedo Piazzolla, Jr.&#x27;s biological brother. In &quot;Episode II&quot;, Albedo uses information gathered during the events of &quot;Episode I&quot; to open the way to the original planet Miltia, which becomes the focus of a conflict between the Federation and Ormus. Ormus&#x27; leader Sergius gains control of a powerful mech called Proto Omega, destroying Miltia in the process. He is then killed by the Testaments, who give Albedo control of Proto Omega, forcing Jr. to kill him. In &quot;Episode III&quot;, Shion, KOS-MOS, chaos and the rest of their group confront both the Testaments—which includes a resurrected Albedo—and Vector CEO Wilhelm. Wilhelm is revealed to be an immortal being stopping the universe&#x27;s destruction through eternal recurrence. The group defeats him, then KOS-MOS and chaos help banish the Gnosis to the region of Lost Jerusalem. Shion and Jr. set off to find Lost Jerusalem and save the universe. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; follows the character Jan Sauer—later known as the cyborg Ziggurat 8 (Ziggy for short)—as he investigates the crimes of a cyberspace-based serial killer a century before the events of &quot;Episode I&quot;.

==History==
===Concept and development===
The creator of &quot;Xenosaga&quot; was Tetsuya Takahashi, who had previously worked at Square on multiple projects including entries in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Together with his wife Soraya Saga, Takahashi created a proposal for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;; while rejected, they were allowed to develop the proposal as its own project, titled &quot;Xenogears&quot;. A sequel to &quot;Xenogears&quot; was allegedly in the planning stages, but it was never released. Wanting to create his own project, unable to get suitable funding from Square, and disagreeing with Square&#x27;s focus on its major franchises such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, Takahashi left Square and founded Monolith Soft with a number of staff from &quot;Xenogears&quot;. Creating the proposal for &quot;Xenosaga&quot; during 1999 as a six-part series, development began on the first game in 2000 under the codename &quot;Project X&quot;, taking two years to develop with a staff of between 60 and 100 people, with around 20 of them being veterans of &quot;Xenogears&quot;. The team were helped by Namco, who provided funding and acted as the publisher. The scenario was written by Takahashi and Saga. The &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, while carrying over thematic and design elements from &quot;Xenogears&quot;, is an unconnected spiritual successor to that game.

Following the release of &quot;Episode I&quot;, Takahashi and other Monolith Soft staff reassessed the series and the general structure of Monolith Soft. Takahashi, who had acted as the first game&#x27;s director, stepped down to allow the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series to grow. He gave the development of &quot;Episode II&quot; and future &quot;Xenosaga&quot; projects to a team of younger developers. The new team decided to shift the game&#x27;s focus based on player feedback and expand the series into other media. Takahashi continued to act as a supervisor to ensure the series remained true to the original overall plan. The draft, created by Takahashi and Saga, was turned into a script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who needed to condense and even cut several events from the original draft to fit it into a single game. Saga later commented that these changes resulted in the planned scenario for &quot;Episode III&quot; also being changed. A portion of the intended narrative of &quot;Episode II&quot; was turned into the plot of &quot;Pied Piper&quot;. &quot;Pied Piper&quot; was co-developed by Monolith Soft, Namco Mobile and Tom Create. Following the completion of &quot;Episode II&quot; and &quot;Pied Piper&quot;, Saga left the series.

When &quot;Episode I&quot; and &quot;Episode II&quot; were remade as &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot;, which was Monolith Soft&#x27;s first portable title and co-developed with Tom Create. Takahashi worked with scenario writer Yuichiro Takeda on the scenario, which was to both include the original games&#x27; events and incorporate elements and scenarios cut from the original versions. While doing this, Takahashi and Takeda needed to keep the scenario consistent with the in-development &quot;Episode III&quot;. The volume of the game&#x27;s scenario and Takahashi&#x27;s wish to cut as little story as possible resulted in the game being given a two-dimensional artstyle. &quot;Episode III&quot;, which began development during the last development stages for &quot;Episode II&quot;, was designed to be the last entry in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series. In addition to up the story of Shion while also leaving room for further entries if there was enough demand, further adjustments were made to both gameplay and graphics based on combined staff comments and fan feedback. Takahashi supervised the project and created the draft, with the script again being written by Yonesaka.

The &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series incorporates multiple references to Biblical mythology, Jewish mysticism and Gnosticism; several character, object and place names (such as Nephilim, Zohar, Gnosis, Merkabah) are taken from sources within these belief systems. The universal structure incorporates elements of Zen, with the names of central characters KOS-MOS and chaos being deliberate homages to the universal concepts of order and chaos. It additionally draws on the philosophy and literature of Carl Jung and Nietzsche. Nietzsche in particular is heavily referenced throughout the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; trilogy, with each entry taking its subtitle from the native title of one of his famous works; for &quot;Episode I&quot; and &quot;Episode II&quot;, the subtitles tied directly into the story themes and characters. The subtitle of &quot;Pied Piper&quot; likewise tied to the game&#x27;s narrative.

===Music===

The score for &quot;Episode I&quot; was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had created the music for &quot;Xenogears&quot;. Mitsuda worked with Takahashi to create tracks based upon specific locations and scenario elements rather than general recycled tracks for segments of the game. For &quot;Episode II&quot;, the music was composed by three people: Yuki Kajiura, who had found fame as a composer for anime series; Shinji Hosoe, who worked on &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; and the &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; series; and Ayako Saso, who had composed for &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;. Kajiura worked on tracks which played during cinematic cutscenes, while Hosoe and Saso composed other cutscene music and gameplay tracks. Hosoe and Saso worked together as part of the Super Sweep music group, but they did not collaborate with Kajiura on any tracks, or even meet with her during the game&#x27;s production. Kajiura returned to create the entire score for &quot;Episode III&quot;, drawing upon the game&#x27;s concept art and scenario when creating the music. All three games have received album releases, although both &quot;Episode II&quot; and &quot;Episode III&quot; saw large portions of their scores go unreleased due to varying factors.

==Reception==
In an article for 1UP.com about video game series that had ended prematurely, Scott Sharkey felt that no-one was surprised when the series ended with &quot;Episode III&quot; as he deemed the series far too ambitious. Jeremy Parish, writing for USGamer, felt that Takahashi managed to &quot;[come] through&quot; despite his planned six-part series being cut down by half, with &quot;Episode III&quot; being a satisfactory conclusion to the series&#x27; storyline. He also noted that &quot;Xenosaga&quot; showed a trend with Takakashi&#x27;s work of being ambitious to the point of needing to compromise the original plan due to external limitations. Blake Peterson, in a feature on the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series, felt that the success of later &quot;Xeno&quot; titles—which took a different approach and had met with critical and commercial success—meant that the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series would not be continued.

===Individual titles===
&quot;Episode I&quot; received positive reviews upon release. The narrative was generally praised for its complex structure and cinematic approach, while its gameplay was seen as enjoyable despite initially being complicated even by genre standards and the mech segments not feeling consequential. The graphics and music were generally praised, although the latter was felt to be too sparse. &quot;Episode II&quot;, which had seen its gameplay and graphics reworked from &quot;Episode I&quot;, received praise from critics for both these adjustments and the refocusing of its narrative despite the latter&#x27;s short length. The replacement of some of the original English voice actors also came in for criticism.

&quot;Episode III&quot; received praise for its narrative and the way it concluded the series&#x27; overarching plot, but many felt that there was too much need for knowledge of the original games for it to be enjoyable for newcomers. The battle system and character customization also saw praise, although other gameplay aspects such as side activities divided opinion. &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; was generally praised by critics; while some more technical elements of the story slowed the pace, the narrative was generally seen as the game&#x27;s strongest feature, while the general gameplay and battle system were also praised for removing the more convoluted elements from the mainline titles. In import reviews, it was commented that the extensive amount of Japanese text would be the largest barrier for those who wished to import the game from Japan.

===Sales===
&quot;Episode I&quot; managed a strong debut, selling over 240,000 units within three days of its release, and becoming the seventh best-selling game in Japan during 2002. It was also a commercial success internationally, going on to sell over one million copies. &quot;Episode II&quot; debuted at #2 in sales charts, going on to sell 280,000 in Japan during 2004. It also saw commercial success in North America, although no sales figures were revealed. Despite this, &quot;Episode II&quot; underperformed commercially, reaching just over 50% of Namco&#x27;s projected sales target. &quot;Xenosaga I &amp; II&quot; met with poor sales, with its debut being seen as disappointing for the still-popular series, and going on to sell over 38,000 units during 2006. &quot;Episode III&quot; debuted with sales approaching 124,000, noted as being the lowest debut for the main trilogy. Selling over 181,000 copies in Japan during 2006, it went on to sell 343,000 units across Japan, mainland Asia and North America by February 2007. Takahashi later stated that the series as a whole had underperformed.
==Legacy==

The initial success of &quot;Xenosaga&quot; turned Monolith Soft into a popular developer, with Namco placing the company alongside Namco Tales Studio as a valuable development partner. Following the release of &quot;Episode III&quot;, and the mixed reception received by the series as a whole, the entire development team were in a state of low morale. Partly to boost team morale and create a game players would enjoy, the team developed a new RPG for the Wii. Originally titled &quot;Monado: Beginning of the World&quot;, its title was eventually changed to &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;. During its development, the team moved away from the narrative and design techniques used for the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; games, which were considered old-fashioned. The success of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; led to the development of further &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; titles. In a later interview, Takahashi stated that he would be willing to develop further titles in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series if funding was provided.

The character KOS-MOS was included as part of the playable cast of &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot; for the PlayStation 2, a crossover title developed by Monolith Soft featuring characters from both Namco and Capcom-owned game franchises. KOS-MOS and her rival from &quot;Xenosaga Episode III&quot; T-elos appeared in &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot;. Supporting character MOMO was later introduced alongside KOS-MOS and T-elos in the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier Exceed&quot;. Both KOS-MOS and T-elos starred in &quot;Project X Zone&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, a spiritual successor to &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot; from the same development team. KOS-MOS also appeared in its sequel &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; alongside &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; heroine Fiora. KOS-MOS and T-elos made cameo appearances as titular blades in &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;.. KOS-MOS&#x27;s head armor from &quot;Xenosaga I&quot; makes a late game appearance in &quot;Tales of Arise&quot; as part of its artifacts system. KOS-MOS was added as a playable character during a limited-time event in Tales of the Rays, additionally, costumes based on MOMO, T-elos and Chaos were added for other playable characters.

<doc id="321422" wikidata="Q2247980" url="?curid=321422" title="KOS-MOS">
<text>(recursive acronym for Kosmos Obey Strategical Multiple Operation System) is a fictional character from the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; role-playing video game series by Monolith Soft and Bandai Namco Entertainment. KOS-MOS also appears as a major character in the anime &quot;&quot; and in several crossover video games.

==Conception and design==

Created for the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series by Monolith Soft, KOS-MOS was conceived by Tetsuya Takahashi. According to his wife and &quot;Xenosaga&quot; writer Soraya Saga, due to how they often depicted human characters in their works as &quot;strong will in a fragile flesh and blood&quot;, KOS-MOS was meant to be the opposite, &quot;the delicate pieces of soul in an unbreakable vessel&quot;. While she acknowledge she was unable to show the character&#x27;s story fully within the games, she stated &quot;I think it must be left veiled for now.&quot; When writing the game, religious themes were added due to Saga&#x27;s &quot;deep interest in the power of belief people have&quot;. Meanwhile the name KOS-MOS in part came from Takahashi&#x27;s thoughts on Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy regarding the &quot;will of power&quot;.

Her design was created by artists Kouichi Mugitani and Kunihiko Tanaka. Several of their designs went unused, however Mugitani would later recycle some of them for his own doujin work. Prior to Mugitani&#x27;s involvement, the development team had tried to create her design &quot;in-house&quot;. However, Takahashi was unsatisfied with the submitted work. When Mugitani was hired to create the mecha designs for the game, Takahashi asked him to also create a &quot;robo girl in a bondage-type outfit&quot;. In Takahashi&#x27;s eyes, while normally he would stand by his convictions, he instead felt KOS-MOS &quot;should swing whichever way the wind was blowing&quot; and wanted to aim for an extreme, even providing Mugatani with pictures of one of his favorite pornographic film actresses. While Mugatani designed her body, her head and face were designed by Tanaka. Tanaka, who was an artist for the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; project as a whole, not only created her face and headgear, but finalized the design as a whole. Upon seeing the earliest draft, Takahashi felt they have achieved the design he was after, particularly with the abdominal muscles he had given her.

Other influences for KOS-MOS&#x27; design, particularly her &quot;Archetype&quot; body, came from artist Hans Bellmer″s doll creations, an artistic direction Takahashi wanted to maintain through her various iterations. Each iteration of KOS-MOS took into account criticisms towards the previous designs. Takahashi noted that while the &quot;Ver. 4.0&quot; design of her character is considered the most popular with fans, he himself felt it was the farthest away from the concept he had envisioned, as human influences had started to manifest in her appearance. Though he acknowledged it was created by the design team&#x27;s consensus, he felt she was too &quot;human-like&quot;, stating &quot;A vessel is a vessel and shouldn&#x27;t mean anything more than that, you shouldn&#x27;t be fooled into thinking it&#x27;s anything more than that.&quot; Mugatani on the other hand appreciated the artistic opportunities her mechanical design afforded, stating &quot;For those of us who find the inner workings of the female body stimulating, KOS-MOS is a porn star [...] She shows us a beautiful structure of the human body in a different way from the grotesque, with a cool look on her face.&quot;

KOS-MOS&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot; was designed by Tanaka. He wanted to keep the design similar to the original &quot;Ver.1&quot; appearance of the character, and something that would represent &quot;Xenosaga&quot; in the game as a whole. One significant change they did from previous versions of KOS-MOS was to have her main laser attack come from her visor instead of her chest at Takahashi&#x27;s suggestion, and he added temporary &quot;cat ears&quot; to the sides of it to act as heat sinks. Originally he had considered giving her a &quot;dress&quot; of shorts around her shoulders and hips for a &quot;Gravity Drive&quot; attack, taking inspiration from magical girl anime &quot;Pretty Cure&quot;, but the development team felt it was excessive and he agreed. The finalized design was named &quot;KOS-MOS Re:&quot;, as Tanaka intended it to be a refrain of Mugitani&#x27;s work on the character.

==Appearances==
KOS-MOS is an armored female android developed by the interstellar conglomerate, Vector Industries. She is made entirely of mechanical parts and nanomachines. She is programmed based on the tenets of logic, probability, and the completion of her assigned mission. However, threats to the physical safety of her co-creator, Shion Uzuki, cause KOS-MOS to temporarily ignore these parameters. She is equipped with a &quot;Simulated Personality OS&quot; to aid in communication, although she appears incapable of emotion.

KOS-MOS has significant powers believed to be superior to all other party members. In addition to superhuman strength and speed, the nanomachines her body is formed from allow her to morph parts of her body (specifically her arms) into various energy projectile and melee weapons. Her body is also able to self-repair and is very durable though not indestructible, and she is also protected by a force shield. She also possesses the ability to summon weapons such as the F-GSHOT chainguns and her famous F-SCYTHE and equipment from another location via U.M.N. transport. She also has a long-range sensory array, the D.S.S.S. system, and CPU that exceeds even those possessed by Observational Realians. She also possesses a Hilbert Effect projector whose power is thousands of times greater than that achieved by even the largest spaceships.

KOS-MOS possesses several black box components left behind by Kevin Winnicot. Each of these black box features is found in each of her skeletons, Version 1, Version 2, Version 3 and Version 4. One of these is her potent X-BUSTER weapon, a powerful burst of energy beams from her abdomen that absorbs the Gnosis. Others are related to her &quot;simulated personality&quot; OS and her self-awareness. KOS-MOS also has some form of energy manipulation tied to the Zohar. KOS-MOS has another weapon system called the &quot;Tertiary Weapon System&quot;, which is seen periodically throughout the series. They consist of a set of energy wings, a pair of energy cannons and other attachments meant to be fitted onto her. While she is programmed to protect Vector personnel unconditionally, her highest priority is to protect Shion specifically.

An almost human alternate persona tends to come out from time to time in the form of a blue-eyed KOS-MOS. This blue-eyed KOS-MOS is far more powerful than red-eyed KOS-MOS and talks in a more empathetic human-sounding voice. This alternate KOS-MOS is in fact KOS-MOS&#x27; true personality that partially awakens at times when Shion is in extreme danger.

KOS-MOS is one of many playable characters in the 2005 tactical role-playing game &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, along with M.O.M.O. and Shion also from &quot;Xenosaga&quot;. In 2008, she appeared as one of playable characters in the role-playing game &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier&quot;. That same year, KOS-MOS made a cameo appearance in the role-playing game &quot;Tales of Hearts&quot;, where she is one of many supporting attack characters for the player. In 2010, she appeared as a playable character in &quot;Super Robot Taisen OG Saga: Endless Frontier Exceed&quot;. In 2012, she appeared as a playable character in the tactical role-playing game &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, as well as the 2015 sequel.

==Promotion and merchandise==
Numerous figures and figurines of KOS-MOS in various scales have been released in Japan, several of them produced by the company Bandai and cited as being in high demand. In 2013, Volks released a licensed 60 cm fashion doll of KOS-MOS Version 4, which was only available for purchase by a limited preorder. In 2005, &quot;Soulcalibur III&quot; included items for its custom character creator to recreate her appearance. In the 2008 role-playing game &quot;Tales of Vesperia&quot;, KOS-MOS costume is available as a downloadable content for the character Judith in the PlayStation 3 version. In the 2017 &quot;Xeno&quot; series entry &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles 2&quot;, KOS-MOS appears as one of the Rare Blades, an in-game anthropomorphic weapon obtainable via Core Crystals.

One particular figure included with the limited edition release of &quot;Xenosaga: Episode II&quot; was of such poor quality that mockery of it went viral. Jokingly dubbed &quot;Jashin MOK-KOS&quot; or &quot;Evil God MOK-KOS&quot; by collectors, the name has since become synonymous within the figure collecting community with poorly made merchandise. Monolith themselves made a self-deprecating reference to the figure in another game, &quot;Baten Kaitos Origins&quot;, via a boss called &quot;Wicked Gawd&quot;. Takahashi himself commented on the figure, noting that part of the problem was due to his vision of how the &quot;Ver.2&quot; KOS-MOS iteration the figure represented was meant to look, particularly due to his insistence to use a gel-like substance to simulate artificial muscles. While he didn&#x27;t blame the sculptor, he did blame mass production and the limitations of such at the time, and his belief that Monolith at the time did not have a clear target audience or understand his &quot;extremely obscure niches&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Since her introduction, KOS-MOS was well received. The staff of UGO.com described her as &quot;widely regarded as one of the most awesome characters to ever come out of Monolith&#x27;s design department&quot;, praising her as single-handedly making the game a pleasure to play due to her &quot;sheer badassitude&quot;. Matt Miller of &quot;Game Informer&quot; stated that &quot;Amid the strange philosophical and religious overtones&quot; of the series, KOS-MOS stood out as a character that &quot;can&#x27;t be forgotten&quot;, and appreciated the air of mystery around her. Alex Williams of &quot;DieHard GameFan&quot; described her as &quot;easily one of the coolest characters I’ve seen&quot;, further describing her as a &quot;bad ass&quot; and praising the depth of her character. Charles de Clercq in his book &quot;Les Légendes Xenogears et Xenosaga: Monolithes brisés&quot; called her a &quot;true muse&quot;, praising the effect of Namco&#x27;s heavy marketing of her image and how it benefited the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; series&#x27; visibility, and stated that the series could not exist without &quot;the image of KOS-MOS, for better or worse&quot;. Meanwhile, Stephen Harris of &quot;RPGFan&quot; praised the symmetry of her appearance and how well she stood out amongst the cast, though did concede that her &quot;scantily clad android&quot; design &quot;will raise more than a few eyebrows the first time she struts her stuff on screen.&quot;

Robert Mejia in the book &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot; stated that while many characters in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; franchise warranted discussion, KOS-MOS stood out due to how &quot;she speaks to the question if a robot can have a soul&quot;. He further described her design and narrative as one of the &quot;evolution of posthumanism&quot; through her various changes across the series. Mejia enjoyed how as the series progressed, her dialogue became less robotic and more human, reflecting her own awakening consciousness, and despite being seen as antiquated in the &quot;Xenosaga&quot; universe due to being an android, she represented the pursuits of attempting to create life strictly from artificial intelligence. He further suggested her role in the story suggested that analytical and physical superiority does not make a better &quot;human&quot;, as her adherence towards a purely logical mindset is impacted by the presence of the &quot;soul&quot; within her teaching her the value of a human life. He further added that through KOS-MOS&#x27; portrayal, it provided an argument that for &quot;posthuman perfection is contingent upon being infected with human imperfection.&quot;

Andrew B.R. Elliott and Matthew Wilhelm Kapell in the book &quot;Playing with the Past&quot; saw her relationship with T-elos as an interpretation of Gnosticism, in particular describing the outcome as a &quot;radical reinterpretation of Christian myth&quot;, with Mary Magdalene being the one resurrected in the future to protect the universe. Through this they felt it presented the Gnostic principle of rejecting a material body to strengthen one&#x27;s soul. While KOS-MOS throughout the series had gradually developed a more thoughtful and caring personality, T-elos was represented by her passion, pride and anger, due to her biological components. Despite physically being closer to Mary due to these components, Mary embracing KOS-MOS displayed a desire to remain with a more calm and collected mind. They additionally praised how this conclusion reflected the series themes of connecting divinity with technological controls or devices.

&quot;RPGFan&quot;″s Tyler Trosper considered her one of the most amazing women in roleplaying games, describing her as having &quot;a legacy that outlives her games&quot;. He elaborated further by citing the large amount of merchandise and visibility Namco had provided to KOS-MOS, despite the abrupt end to her story. He additionally pointed out that while she fits the &quot;stoic android learns how to be human&quot; archetype commonly seen in science fiction, her journey through the games helped set her apart, and particularly emphasized how her emotions gave her greater power. Trosper also pointed out that her relationship with Shion could be interpreted in different ways, and was crucial in her character growth.

<text>Martin Charles Gutzwiller (12 October 1925 – 3 March 2014) was a Swiss-American physicist, known for his work on field theory, quantum chaos, and complex systems. He spent most of his career at IBM Research, and was also an adjunct professor of physics at Yale University.

==Biography==
Gutzwiller was born on October 12, 1925, in the Swiss city of Basel. He completed a Diploma degree from ETH Zurich, where he studied quantum physics under Wolfgang Pauli. He then went to the University of Kansas and completed a Ph.D under Max Dresden. After graduation, he worked on microwave engineering for Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie, on geophysics for Shell Oil, and eventually for IBM Research in Switzerland, New York City, and Yorktown Heights, until his retirement in 1993. He also held temporary teaching appointments at Columbia University, ETH Zurich, Paris-Orsay, and Stockholm. He was Vice Chair for the Committee on Mathematical Physics, of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, from 1987 to 1993. He joined Yale University as adjunct professor in 1993, retaining the position until his retirement.

==Scientific work==
Gutzwiller formulated the Gutzwiller approximation for describing electrons with strong local interactions in terms of the Gutzwiller wave function, composed of a simple many-electron wave function acted on by a correlation operator (&quot;Gutzwiller projection&quot;). He was also the first to investigate the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics in chaotic systems. In that context, he developed the Gutzwiller trace formula, the main result of periodic orbit theory, which gives a recipe for computing spectra from periodic orbits of a system. He is the author of the classic monograph on the subject, &quot;Chaos in Classical and Quantum Mechanics&quot; (1990).

Gutzwiller is also known for finding novel solutions to mathematical problems in field theory, wave propagation, crystal physics, and celestial mechanics. In appreciation of his contributions to theoretical physics, the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPIPKS) annually awards the Martin Gutzwiller Fellowship to acknowledge and promote exceptional research in this field.

==Book collecting==
Gutzwiller had an avid interest in the history of science. He eventually acquired a valuable collection of rare books on astronomy and mechanics. Shortly after his death, his collection was auctioned at Swann Galleries, in New York City. The auction took place on April 3, 2014, and raised a total of US$341,788.

==Honors==
* Fellow of National Academies of Science in 1992
* Fellow of American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993 
* Fellow of American Physical Society
* Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics in 1993 
* Max Planck medal in 2003

<text>Waikāne or Waikane (), also known as North Koolaupoko (), is an area and census-designated place in the County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, on the island of Oahu. It had a population of 778 at the 2010 census. In Hawaiian, &quot;koolau poko&quot; means &quot;short windward&quot;, referring to the fact that this is the shorter of the two windward districts on the island (&quot;Koolauloa&quot; or &quot;long windward&quot; is the other). Koolaupoko extends from Makapuu Point on the southeast to Kaōio Point on the north. Included within the district, south of North Koolaupoko, are the largest windward towns of Kāneohe, Kailua, and Waimānalo.
Waikāne lies mostly along the coastline of Kāneohe Bay and consists of several lush valleys that extend inland to the steep face of the Koolau &quot;pali&quot; (cliff). The first valley north of Kahaluu is Waiāhole. Next is Waikāne, then Hakipuu, and northernmost is Kualoa. This area differs from the towns, valleys, and &quot;ahupuaa&quot; of the southern part of Koolaupoko in that it is mostly undeveloped, decidedly rural in character, with many small farms.

Despite the long shoreline, public access to Kāneohe Bay is somewhat limited by private holdings. A small community park at Waiāhole was enlarged and improved in 2003. A larger city and county park at Kualoa provides camping and picnic areas, a long narrow beach, and views of Mokoliʻi Islet. The south side of Kualoa Regional Park faces onto Kāneohe Bay, and the east shore is a fringing reef off the Pacific Ocean coast of northeast Oahu.

The U.S. postal code for all of North Koolaupoko is 96744 (the same as Kāneohe).

== Geography ==
The Waikāne census-designated place (CDP) is located at 21°29&#x27;47&quot; North, 157°51&#x27;34&quot; West (21.496355, -157.859321). Southward along the shore of Kāneohe Bay via Kamehameha Highway (State Rte. 83) are (from Waikāne) Waiāhole and Kahaluu. Northwest up the coast beyond Kualoa and Kaōio Point is the town of Kaaawa.

The Waikane CDP encompasses much more than the location known as Waikāne, which is but one of several valleys comprising the north end of the Koolaupoko District. The CDP has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The total area is 4.88% water.

<text>In economics, perfect information (sometimes referred to as &quot;no hidden information&quot;) is a feature of perfect competition. With perfect information in a market, all consumers and producers have complete and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, their own utility, and own cost functions.

In game theory, a sequential game has perfect information if each player, when making any decision, is perfectly informed of all the events that have previously occurred, including the &quot;initialization event&quot; of the game (e.g. the starting hands of each player in a card game).

Perfect information is importantly different from complete information, which implies common knowledge of each player&#x27;s utility functions, payoffs, strategies and &quot;types&quot;. A game with perfect information may or may not have complete information.

Games where some aspect of play is &quot;hidden&quot; from opponents – such as the cards in poker and bridge – are examples of games with imperfect information.

==Examples==
Chess is an example of a game with perfect information, as each player can see all the pieces on the board at all times. Other games with perfect information include tic-tac-toe, Reversi, checkers, and Go.

Academic literature has not produced consensus on a standard definition of perfect information which defines whether games with chance, &quot;but no secret information&quot;, and games with &quot;simultaneous moves&quot; are games of perfect information.

Games which are sequential (players alternate in moving) and which have chance events (with known probabilities to all players) but &quot;no secret information&quot;, are sometimes considered games of perfect information. This includes games such as backgammon and Monopoly. But there are some academic papers which do not regard such games as games of perfect information because the results of chance themselves are unknown prior to them occurring.

Games with &quot;simultaneous moves&quot; are generally not considered games of perfect information. This is because each player holds information, which is secret, and must play a move without knowing the opponent&#x27;s secret information. Nevertheless, some such games are symmetrical, and fair. An example of a game in this category includes rock paper scissors.

<doc id="321443" wikidata="Q1632197" url="?curid=321443" title="Whoopee!">
<text>Whoopee! is a 1928 musical comedy play with a book based on Owen Davis&#x27;s play, &quot;The Nervous Wreck.&quot; The musical libretto was written by William Anthony McGuire, with music by Walter Donaldson and lyrics by Gus Kahn. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1928, starring Eddie Cantor, and introduced the hit song &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot;, sung by Ruth Etting. A film version opened in 1930.

==Synopsis==
Setting: Mission Rest, Arizona; Black Top Canyon; The Bar &quot;M&quot; Ranch; the Wilderness; the Desert.

Sheriff Bob Wells and the daughter of a rancher Sally Morgan are getting married. She is in love with Wanenis, whose part-Indian heritage presents social difficulties for their romance. Sally abandons Sheriff Bob and their wedding, catching a ride with Henry Williams. As a hypochondriac, Henry has problems of his own, but Sally adds to his problems when she leaves a note saying they have eloped. A chase ensues, with the jilted Bob; Mary, Henry&#x27;s nurse who is in love with him; and a cast of others. Along the way they arrive at the Indian Reservation where Wanenis lives. The movie star Leslie Daw enters the proceedings and sings the torchy, sentimental &quot;Love Me, or Leave Me&quot;.

==Productions==
&quot;Whoopee!&quot; opened on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre on December 4, 1928, and closed on November 23, 1929, after 407 performances. It was produced by Florenz Ziegfeld, directed by Seymour Felix, dialogue staged by William Anthony McGuire, and dances and ensembles staged by Seymour Felix. The musical starred Eddie Cantor as Henry Williams, Ruth Etting as Leslie Daw, Frances Upton as Sally Morgan, Jack Rutherford as Bob Wells, Paul Gregory as Wanenis and Ethel Shutta as Mary (replacing Ruby Keeler), and featured Buddy Ebsen and Paulette Goddard in the chorus. George Olsen (Ethel Shutta&#x27;s husband) and His Orchestra provided the music for both the stage production and the movie.

Donald J. Stubblebine reports, &quot;It was still going strong after six months but Sam Goldwyn, who bought the rights, closed it down to make the movie with Cantor.&quot; &quot;Whoopee!&quot; was filmed in 1930 as a musical comedy film. Although the plot followed the stage version closely, much of the music was changed.

=== 1979 Revival ===
A revival, based on a Goodspeed Opera House production, was presented at the ANTA Playhouse from February 14, 1979, to August 12, 1979, for 204 performances and 8 previews. Directed by Frank Corsaro with choreography by Dan Siretta, the cast featured Charles Repole (Henry Williams) Beth Austin (Sally Morgan), Carol Swarbrick (Mary) and Susan Stroman (Leslie Daw). This revival added Kahn/Donaldson songs not in the original 1928 show: &quot;My Baby Just Cares For Me&quot; (from the 1930 film version), &quot;Yes, Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot;, and &quot;You&quot; (lyrics by Harold Adamson). Also, &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; is sung by Mary and Henry rather than the essentially unrelated Leslie.

Brooks Atkinson, the theatre critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewed the 1928 Broadway production and called it &quot;a gorgeous spectacle&quot; with &quot;long stretches of excellent comedy&quot;. He especially praised the comedic abilities of Eddie Cantor, &quot;a comedian of deftness and appealing humor. He is sad; he is preoccupied; he is apprehensive or insinuating with those floating eyes...In the past he has been funny, clever and ludicrious. But he has never been so enjoyable.&quot; As to the music, &quot;Walter Donaldson has composed an appropriate score worthy of better singing than it falls heir to.&quot;

The &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Richard Eder called the 1979 Broadway revival a &quot;frequent delight though not an unmitigated one...Most strikingly, it is a superabundance of songs. There is not a poor song in it, and its best ones — the lovely and musically witty &quot;Makin&#x27; Whoopee&quot;, the jiggly &quot;My Baby Just Cares for Me&quot;, and of course the irresistible &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; — are magnificent.&quot; Walter Kerr, then the Times&#x27; Sunday critic, also reacted favorably to the show while calling attention to its nonsensical frivolity: he deemed it &quot;light as a breeze, and just plain out of its head.&quot; Brendan Gill of The New Yorker, however, panned the show.

Repole received a nomination for Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical, and Dan Siretta was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Choreography.

<text>Jonathan Creek is a long-running British mystery crime drama series produced by the BBC and written by David Renwick. It stars Alan Davies as the title character, who works as a creative consultant to a stage magician while also solving seemingly supernatural mysteries through his talent for logical deduction and his understanding of illusions.

==Production==
The series ran semi-regularly from 1997 to 2004, broadcasting for four series and two Christmas specials, initially co-starring Caroline Quentin as Creek&#x27;s collaborator, writer Maddy Magellan. After Quentin&#x27;s departure in 2001, Julia Sawalha joined the cast as new character Carla Borrego, a theatrical agent turned television presenter. Following a five-year hiatus, the series returned for a one-off special on 1 January 2009, &quot;The Grinning Man&quot;, which featured Sheridan Smith as another paranormal investigator with whom Creek joins forces. A further 90-minute special, &quot;The Judas Tree&quot;, was filmed in October 2009 and broadcast on 4 April 2010. A third special, &quot;The Clue of the Savant&#x27;s Thumb&quot;, was shown at Easter 2013. Smith had previously worked with David Renwick on his sitcom &quot;Love Soup&quot;.

Sheridan Smith reprised her role as Joey in both specials. Series 5 comprised three episodes and featured Sarah Alexander as Jonathan&#x27;s wife Polly. These episodes were shown at 9pm on Friday 28 February, 7 and 14 March 2014 respectively.

In 2014, conflicting reports surfaced regarding Alan Davies&#x27;s view of the show. In one article published online he was said to be &quot;happy to do Jonathan Creek for another ten years&quot; and praised Renwick&#x27;s talent as a writer.

On 4 March 2016, it was reported that the series would be returning for another 90-minute one-off special, with filming to begin in summer 2016. The episode, &quot;Daemons&#x27; Roost&quot;, aired on 28 December 2016. Alexander returned as Jonathan Creek&#x27;s wife Polly, alongside guest stars Warwick Davis, Emun Elliott and Rosalind March.

The cult success of the series won it the BAFTA for Best Drama Series in 1998. It was notable for featuring comic characters and sub-plots that lent a lot of humour to the series. Unusually, it was produced by the BBC&#x27;s in-house Entertainment department rather than the Drama department – this was because Renwick preferred working with people he knew rather than the people at Drama who might not share his vision. It has included guest-stars such as Bob Monkhouse, Griff Rhys Jones, Rik Mayall, Jack Dee, Bill Bailey, John Bird, Nigel Planer and Ade Edmondson, who are mainly associated with comedy, but who gave straight performances.

The first two series were broadcast in the U.S. on a number of PBS stations, while the remainder aired on BBC America.

==Concept and casting==
Renwick wanted to write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of detection rather than action, which most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time. Also, whereas most of these were about &quot;who did it&quot; (&quot;Inspector Morse&quot; or &quot;Taggart&quot;) and &quot;why it was done&quot; (&quot;Cracker&quot;), this new series would be about &quot;how it was done&quot;, with such tropes as murders committed in locked rooms, a person being in two places at once, or impossible thefts. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective&#x27;s job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the crime was committed.

Magic would play an important part of the series, but it would be in the form of tricks and sleight-of-hand used by stage magicians to audiences. The programme often exposed how such tricks are actually done, but in a way quite banal compared to the trick itself.

The series would also focus on the relationship between Creek and his collaborator Maddy Magellan, a writer who often uses dishonest means in order to expose miscarriages of justice. The relationship would be a mainly platonic one, though they do at some stage consummate their relationship only to agree that it must never happen again. (In his early planning, Renwick had thought that Maddy should be Creek&#x27;s stepmother and that they would investigate crime in memory of his murdered father. However, he decided that the concept of the avenging son was far too &quot;Batman&quot; and in the series Creek&#x27;s parents are mentioned as having moved to America.)

Quentin was Renwick&#x27;s first choice for Maddy Magellan, but the casting of Creek proved something of a problem. Renwick had wanted Nicholas Lyndhurst, but he turned it down. Rik Mayall was also offered the part, but was, at the time, busy with stage work (he would later guest-star in a Christmas special of the series). Hugh Laurie showed a great deal of interest and agreed to take the part, but later turned it down as he could not figure out Creek&#x27;s motivations for investigating the cases Maddy involves him in, especially when he shows so much reluctance in some of the episodes.

Others who were tried for the part included Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had already worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;). Almost a dozen actors were considered before Susan Belbin saw Davies during a rehearsal for a sitcom. Davies was invited round to talk to Renwick and &quot;turned up in his duffle coat with straggly hair and a broad grin [and] was self-evidently the closest match yet to Creek as we had always seen him&quot;.

The role of Adam Klaus was originally cast to Anthony Head in 1997 in the pilot episode (&quot;The Wrestler&#x27;s Tomb&quot;). However, after accepting the role of Rupert Giles on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Head was unable to play Adam Klaus in later episodes, leaving the way clear for Stuart Milligan to take over the role.

==Cast==

===Guest cast===
Many well-known actors have appeared in the series, including Bob Monkhouse, Rik Mayall (who had been considered to play Jonathan) and Jack Dee who are better known for their comedy roles. Other guest stars, both comedy and straight, have included: Rob Jarvis who made two appearances, each time as a different character, Colin Baker, Sheila Gish, Alistair McGowan, John Bluthal, Lysette Anthony, Simon Day, Selina Cadell, Peter Davison, Pippa Haywood, Dermot Crowley, Deborah Grant, Amanda Holden, Nicola Walker, Francis Matthews, Griff Rhys Jones, Maxine Peake, Rebecca Front, Terrence Hardiman, Michael Brandon, Jim Bowen, Dinah Sheridan, Hattie Hayridge, Steven Berkoff, Mary Tamm, Benjamin Whitrow, Bill Bailey, Sophie Thompson, Maureen Lipman, Celia Imrie, Judy Parfitt, Katherine Parkinson, Paul McGann, Ian McNeice, Joanna Lumley, Paula Wilcox, Raquel Cassidy, Kieran Hodgson, June Whitfield, Josie Lawrence and Warwick Davis.

Adrian Edmondson appeared in the fourth series in a recurring role. Jonathan Ross, Michael Grade and Bamber Gascoigne have all appeared as themselves.

===Cast links to other Renwick productions===
Actors Annette Crosbie, Peter Copley, Jonathan Kydd, Brian Murphy, John Bluthal, Hannah Gordon, Nick Maloney and John Bird made appearances, (Bird as two different characters, one of which a recurring role) and all worked with Renwick on &quot;One Foot in The Grave&quot;. Additionally Bird worked with Renwick again on his BBC Radio 4 miniseries &quot;Desolation Jests&quot; in late 2016.

Tamsin Greig, Georgie Glen, Sheridan Smith and Sara Markland worked with Renwick on his sitcom &quot;Love Soup&quot;.

Adrian Edmondson had a leading role in Renwick&#x27;s 1993 miniseries &quot;If You See God, Tell Him&quot;.

Doreen Mantle has appeared in eighteen episodes of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;, one episode of &quot;Love Soup&quot;, as well as one episode of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;.

Renwick himself made appearances in two episodes, something which he also did in two of his other notable productions.

==Character development==
The series follows the exploits of Jonathan Creek and (in the first three series) Maddy Magellan, a pushy investigative journalist, as they work together to solve crimes where others have failed.
Creek is a somewhat cynical designer of illusions for stage magician Adam Klaus. He originally lived in a windmill in West Sussex. His ingenuity and lateral thinking usually, if not immediately, lead to an unveiling of the intricacies of the crime.

Magellan is a plausible liar who never seems to have trouble sneaking into closed crime scenes (though she is frequently unceremoniously ejected), and Klaus is a flamboyant performer with a sinister stage persona who is really a dull-witted, insensitive womaniser. In some instances, his magic tricks go comically wrong.

The programme usually features &#x27;impossible crimes&#x27;, for example an offence having been committed in a sealed environment from which no criminal could have escaped (a &quot;locked room mystery&quot;), paranormal thefts and murders. Creek solves these cases using his knowledge of misdirection and illusion. No matter how fantastic the crime appears to be at first, he always finds a rational explanation, giving the character a passing resemblance to stage magician turned paranormal investigator James Randi. Some aspects of the character were inspired by Ali Bongo.

As the series progresses, Creek gradually changes from an asocial anorak to a man with a great deal of wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan&#x27;s trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Davies&#x27; own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan&#x27;s coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and wore it again for the 2009 New Year special.

For the 2001 Christmas special and thereafter, Quentin declined to appear, and so a second supporting role was introduced, theatrical agent Carla Borrego, played by Julia Sawalha. After her first appearance, the character married TV producer Brendan Baxter (Adrian Edmondson), and she became a TV presenter. A third supporting role was introduced when the show returned in 2009 after a five-year hiatus. From &quot;The Grinning Man&quot; onwards, Creek was assisted by online paranormal investigator Joey Ross, played by Sheridan Smith. As Smith was unable to appear in the fifth series due to other commitments, she was replaced by Sarah Alexander as Creek&#x27;s wife and newest sidekick.

Part of the humour comes from the fact that Jonathan often does not want to get involved in other people&#x27;s problems, and has to be pressured into it by Maddy, Carla or Joey. In &quot;The Scented Room&quot;, which centred around a theft from a critic who had lambasted Adam&#x27;s act, he took great delight in announcing that he had solved the crime but wasn&#x27;t going to tell anybody how it was done. Initially, Jonathan was only brought in to investigate because he was asked by Maddy due to her having a professional connection to the crime in her role as a journalist, or because it involved an old friend of theirs (such as one case featuring Jonathan being contacted by an old friend of his mother&#x27;s after her husband was impaled by a sword in a sealed room). As time went on, he acquired a more significant reputation and was independently recruited by such varied contacts as a chief of police or even the United States military.

Over time, the show became noticeably darker, with Jonathan investigating psychopaths, pimps, gangsters and corrupt policemen, who stood in stark contrast to the duplicitous suburbanites of earlier series; one story even saw Maddy being held at gunpoint by a gang member who was only just disarmed thanks to a card trick Jonathan had picked up recently. The 2009 special contained a hybrid of elements from earlier and later series, with the lethal engineering element, somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Mother Redcap&quot;, and the torture and murder of a young woman as she is held dangling by a rope in the middle of a room. This theme continued on in &quot;The Judas Tree&quot; with a murderer being killed and her accomplice then being framed for the crime.

In the 2013 episode &quot;The Clue of the Savant&#x27;s Thumb&quot;, Jonathan Creek had left the world of theatre and magic and is now a high-powered businessman with a wife, Polly. Despite this, and his disillusionment with his old work due to the lack of real awe received when he made his announcements, he has still returned to his roots when faced with particularly baffling cases, such as a dead man vanishing from a locked room. During the fifth series, he and his wife move into her family&#x27;s old village house, with Polly attempting to encourage Jonathan to become part of the local lifestyle, but Jonathan is distracted by various minor mysteries, as well as enthusiastic fans asking for his assistance. The Christmas 2016 special sees a similar format to past specials as an old secret – in this case, an apparently demonic ritual where women witness their lovers thrown through the air into a fire – plays a key role in the death of a man Jonathan once cleared of murder (although the subsequent investigation prompts Jonathan to realise that the man actually &quot;did&quot; commit the crime of which he was accused).

==Episodes==

==Music==
The distinctive theme tune is an arrangement by Julian Stewart Lindsay of Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. Lindsay wrote the incidental music for the first three series, after which it was written by Rick Wentworth.

==Adaptations and possible return==
===Similarity to other television programmes===
Other television programmes have utilised the formula of a magician helping police to solve crimes, such as the U.S.-made programmes &quot;The Magician&quot;, starring Bill Bixby, which aired in 1973–74, and 1986&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Blacke&#x27;s Magic&quot;, starring Hal Linden.

===Attempts at remakes===
There have been three attempts to make a U.S. version of &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;. The first involved Castle Rock, the production company behind series such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, but the initial scripts were not felt to be good enough, and Renwick&#x27;s scripts were rejected by CBS. The second attempt, also by Renwick, was for Whoopi Goldberg and would have included Davies.

===Possible return===
In 2021, Davies commented that Renwick &quot;wouldn’t tell me if he had written a script. But if he did write one, I would do it, out of loyalty to him. I can’t see it happening, but who knows.&quot;

In a 2021 interview Renwick discussed his retirement from television and referred to &quot;Daemon&#x27;s Roost&quot; as &quot;the final &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;&quot;, suggesting an end to the series. Davies, Quentin, and other former cast members have made clear that they would return to the show if invited.

===Stage adaptation===
In September 2022 it was reported that Renwick had written stage adaptations of the show and that Davies and Quentin had shown interest in reprising their roles. The project however has been on hold since the COVID-19 pandemic.
