<text>A special interest group (SIG) is a community within a larger organization with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology where members cooperate to effect or to produce solutions within their particular field, and may communicate, meet, and organize conferences. The term was used in 1961 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), an academic and professional computer society. SIG was later popularized on CompuServe, an early online service provider, where SIGs were a section of the service devoted to particular interests.

==Technical SIGs==
The ACM includes many SIGs, some starting as smaller &quot;Special Interest Committees&quot; and formed the first group in 1961. ACM supports further subdivision within SIGs for more impromptu informal discussion groups at conferences which are called Birds of a Feather (BoF).
ACM&#x27;s Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent major areas of computing, addressing the interests of technical communities that drive innovation. SIGs offer a wealth of conferences, publications and activities focused on specific computing sub-disciplines. They enable members to share expertise, discovery and best practices.
The Mathematical Association of America has 14 SIGs ranging from the Arts to the Web (for instruction).

The Association for Information Science and Technology calls its organizational divisions special interest groups.

==Non-technical SIGs==
Organizations that are not technical may also have Special Interest Groups, which are normally focused on a mutual interest or shared characteristic of a subset of members of the organization. An important example for this are trade unions. For identity-based advocacy groups, see identity politics. The Japan Association for Language Teaching has several SIGs. Together they organize a Pan-SIG conference each year.

Mensa International has over a hundred SIGs.

===Political interest groups===

These interest groups support and lobby for areas of special need. For example, the Sierra Club focuses on protecting the environment as well as the wild places on earth. They also promote education on preservation of the environment. Similar advocacy groups promote their special interests and organize to help them with their issue. These political &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; are the classic view of the policy maker. Such groups need a patron to provide capital and support, so the cause has to be one that many will support, in competition with other causes that similarly seek support. Many of these dominant groups have subgroups that lobby for more specific issues, but assist in the overall cause.

<text>John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, (2 June 18224 July 1883), styled Earl of Sunderland from 1822 to 1840 and Marquess of Blandford from 1840 to 1857, was a British Conservative cabinet minister, politician, peer, and nobleman. He was the paternal grandfather of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill.

==Background and education==
John Spencer-Churchill was born at Garboldisham Hall, Norfolk, the eldest son of George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough, and Lady Jane Stewart, daughter of Admiral George Stewart, 8th Earl of Galloway. He was educated at Eton College and Oriel College, Oxford.

He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Yeomanry in 1842 and was promoted to captain on 22 April 1847. His father and younger brother also served in the regiment.

He held 23,000 acres, mostly in Oxfordshire.

==Political career==
Spencer-Churchill was Member of Parliament for Woodstock from 1844 to 1845 and again from 1847 to 1857.

On the formation of Disraeli&#x27;s second cabinet in 1874, he was offered, but declined, the Viceroyalty of Ireland. He again held office under Disraeli as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1876 to 1880.

Spencer-Churchill was president of The Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners&#x27; Royal Benevolent Society for many years. He died suddenly of angina pectoris at 29 Berkeley Square, London, on 4 July 1883. After lying in state at Blenheim Palace, he was buried in the private chapel on 10 July.

<doc id="318068" wikidata="Q131125" url="?curid=318068" title="Hebe (mythology)">
<text>Hebe (; ), in ancient Greek religion and mythology, often given the epithet &quot;Ganymeda&quot; (meaning &quot;Gladdening Princess&quot;), is the goddess of youth or of the prime of life. She functioned as the cupbearer for the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus, serving their nectar and ambrosia. People of Sicyon also worshipped her as the goddess of forgiveness or of mercy.

Hebe is a daughter of Zeus and Hera, and the divine wife of Heracles (Roman equivalent: Hercules). She had influence over eternal youth and the ability to restore youth to mortals, a power that appears exclusive to her, as in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, some gods lament the aging of their favoured mortals. According to Philostratus the Elder, Hebe was the youngest of the gods and the one responsible for keeping them eternally young, and thus was the most revered by them. Her role of ensuring the eternal youth of the other gods is appropriate to her role of serving as cupbearer, as the word &quot;ambrosia&quot; has been linked to a possible Proto-Indo-European translation related to immortality, undying, and lifeforce. In art, she is typically depicted with her father in the guise of an eagle, often offering a cup to him. Eagles were connected with immortality and there was a folklore belief that the eagle (like the phoenix) had the ability to renew itself to a youthful state,
making the association with Hebe logical. Her equivalent Roman goddess is Juventas.

==Etymology==
The is the inherited word for &quot;youth&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;(H)iēgw-eh2-&quot;, &quot;youth, vigour&quot;.

The name &quot;Hebe&quot; comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;youth&quot; or &quot;prime of life&quot;.

Although she was not as strongly associated with her father, Hebe was occasionally referred to with the epithet &quot;Dia&quot; (see Cult), which can be translated to &quot;Daughter of Zeus&quot; or &quot;Heavenly&quot;.

&quot;Juventus&quot; likewise means &quot;youth&quot;, as can be seen in such derivatives as &quot;juvenile&quot;.

==Mythology==

===Birth===

Hebe is the daughter of Zeus and his sister-wife Hera. Pindar in &quot;Nemean Ode 10&quot; refers to her as the most beautiful of the goddesses, and being by her mother&#x27;s side in Olympus forever. In some traditions that were recorded by Servius, her father Zeus gifted her two doves with human voices, and one flew to where the Oracle of Dodona would be established.

In a rare, alternative version of Hebe&#x27;s conception, her mother Hera became pregnant merely by eating a lettuce plant while dining with her fellow Olympian, Apollo. This version was recorded by famed Italian mythographer Natalis Comes. Reconstructed Orphic beliefs may also present a different version of Hera&#x27;s impregnation with Hebe. It should be remembered that this version of the myth of Hebe&#x27;s birth is a speculative reconstruction, and therefore, it likely does not represent how the myth would have been known to its original audience. In another version, Hera sought out a way to become pregnant without assistance of Zeus by travelling to realm of Oceanus and Tethys at the end of the world. There, she entered the garden of Flora and she touched a sole, nameless plant from the land of Olene and became pregnant with Ares. Hera returned to the garden sometime after his birth and ate lettuce to become pregnant with Hebe.

The consumption of lettuce in Ancient Greece was connected to sexual impotency in men and women, with Plutarch recording that women should never eat the heart of a lettuce. Additionally, lettuce was associated with death, as Aphrodite laid the dying Adonis in a patch to potentially aid in his reconstruction. Despite these concerns, it was also believed that lettuce benefited menstrual flow and lactation in women, characteristics that may associate the plant with motherhood. This version of Hebe&#x27;s paternity is referenced by American author Henry David Thoreau in his work &quot;Walden&quot;, where Hebe is described as the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce.

A fragment by Callimachus describes Hera holding a feast to celebrate the seventh day after her daughter Hebe&#x27;s birth. The gods have a friendly argument over who will give the best gift, with Poseidon, Athena, Apollo, and Hephaestus specifically mentioned as presenting toys or, as in Apollo&#x27;s case, songs. Callimachus, who composed a poem for the celebration of the seventh day after the birth of a daughter to his friend Leon, used Apollo&#x27;s gift of a song as a divine prototype for his own gift. In some traditions that were recorded by Servius, her father Zeus gifted her two doves with human voices, and one flew to where the Oracle of Dodona would be established.

Hebe was initially seen in myth as a diligent daughter performing domestic tasks that were typical of high ranking, unmarried girls in ancient Greece. In the Iliad, she did tasks around the household such as drawing baths for her brother Ares and helping Hera enter her chariot.
Additionally, Hebe was often connected to Aphrodite, whom she was described dancing with and acting as her herald or attendant, linking the Classical association between beauty and &quot;the bloom of youth&quot;.

===Marriage===
As the bride of Heracles, Hebe was strongly associated with both brides and her husband in art and literature. She was the patron of brides, due to being the daughter of the goddess of marriage Hera and the importance of her own wedding.
Hebe&#x27;s role as the patron of brides is referenced in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Epithalamion&quot;, where the poem also connects her to the fertility of the bride. In some depictions on vase paintings, such as the Ricci Hydria dated to approximately 525 B.C.E., Hebe drives a chariot and is the one to bring her future husband, Heracles, to Olympus from Earth upon his apotheosis, a role traditionally fulfilled by Athena. A Krator in the Cleveland Museum may depict Hebe in chariot ready to leave Olympus to retrieve her husband in the presence of her mother, Artemis, and Apollo.

The lost comedic play, &quot;Hebes Gamos&quot; (&quot;The Marriage of Hebe&quot;) by Epicharmus of Kos, depicted the wedding feast of Hebe and Heracles. In Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Encomium of Ptolemy Philadelphus&quot;, Heracles dines with Ptolemy I and Alexander at a feast on Olympus and after he has his fill of nectar, he bestows his bow and arrows and club to them and leaves for his wife&#x27;s chamber. Here the couple is presented as one of the paradigms for marriage of Philadelphus and Arsinoe with Heracles retiring to Hebe&#x27;s chambers in a scene reminiscent of a wedding. Catullus in &quot;Poem 68&quot; makes a positive reference to the legal marriage of Heracles to the virginal goddess Hebe to contrast with the poet&#x27;s secret affair with a married woman. Propertius also makes a reference to Heracles feeling a blazing love for Hebe upon his death at Mount Oeta, altering the traditional myth where Heracles marries Hebe after ascending to divinity.

Hebe had two children with Heracles: Alexiares and Anicetus. Although nothing is known about these deities beyond their names, there is a fragment by Callimachus that makes a reference to Eileithyia, Hebe&#x27;s sister and the goddess of childbirth, attending to Hebe while in labour.

===Giver of youth===
One of Hebe&#x27;s roles was to be the cupbearer to the gods, serving them ambrosia and nectar. In Classical sources, her departure from this role was due to her marriage. Alternatively, the &quot;Iliad&quot; presented Hebe (and at one instance, Hephaestus) as the cup bearer of the gods with the divine hero Ganymede acting as Zeus&#x27;s personal cup bearer. Additionally, Cicero seems to imply that either Hebe or Ganymede, who is typically seen as her successor, could serve in the role of cupbearer at the heavenly feast. The reasoning for Hebe&#x27;s supposed dismissal was transformed into a moralizing story in the 1500s by the Church of England, where it was stated in a note in an English-Latin dictionary that she fell while in attendance to the gods, causing her dress to become undone, exposing her naked body publicly. Although there is no Classical literary or artistic source for this account, the story was modified to function as a warning to women to stay modestly covered at all times, as naked women in particular were seen as shameful by the Church. During this period, she was strongly associated with spring, so this addition of her falling to the myth was also allegorized to represent the change of season from spring to autumn.

According to some Classical authors, Hebe was connected to maintaining the youth and immortality of the other gods. Philostratus the Elder states that she is the reason the other gods are eternally young, and Bacchylides alleges that Hebe, as the princess (&quot;basileia&quot;), is responsible for immortality. This is another justification for her marriage to Heracles, as it ensures not only his immortality but also eternal youth, which were not viewed as equivalent in myths, such as with the case of Tithonus. In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Heracleidae&quot; and in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Hebe grants Iolaus&#x27; wish to become young again in order to fight Eurystheus. In Euripides&#x27; play Orestes, Helen is said to sit on a throne beside Hera and Hebe upon obtaining immortality.

== Cult ==
Hebe was particularly associated with the worship of her mother Hera in Argos and in the Heraion of Argos, one of the main centres of worship of Hera in Greece. It was said that Hebe, in a statue made of ivory and gold, was depicted standing beside a very large statue of Hera, which depicted the goddess seated holding a pomegranate and sceptre with a cuckoo perched on top. A relief made of silver above an altar depicted the marriage of Hebe and Heracles. Both of these depictions have been lost, but Argive coins have been found showing these two statues side by side. It is possible the Hebe was worshipped as or represented the virginal aspect of Hera, or that her worship with her mother was similar to that of Demeter and Persephone, as both potentially represented the cycle of rebirth and renewal. Some scholars theorize that one of the Temples of Hera at Paestum may have been dedicated to Hera and Hebe rather than to Hera and Zeus, which is the more common consensus. Scholars point to the headless bust of a well-dressed young girl that may have served as the antefix or acroterion of the temple as possibly being a representation of Hebe. Hebe was also depicted, alongside Athena, standing beside a sitting statue of Hera in the Temple of Hera at Mantinea in Arkadia, sculptured by Praxiteles.

Hebe also appears to be worshipped jointly with other figures as well. There is a record of a priestess from the deme of Aexone who served both Hebe and Alkmene being rewarded with a crown of olive leaves for her service. Aelian also refer to Hebe being worshipped in a temple that was adjacent to a temple dedicated to her spouse Herakles in an unknown location. The temples, which were separated by a canal, housed roosters in Heracles&#x27;s temple and hens in Hebe&#x27;s temple. Chickens were not commonly associated with either deity and more typically associated with Apollo. Some scholars have indicated that in Assyria, Apollo was particularly associated with Hebe.

Hebe also had her own personal cult and at least one temple in Greece dedicated to her. There was an altar for her in Athens at the Cynosarges. This site also contained gymnasium and altars for Herakles and joint altar to Alcmene and Iolaus In Sicyon, there was a temple dedicated to here and it was the center of her own cult. The Phliasians, who lived near Sicyon, honored Hebe (whom they called Dia, meaning &quot;Daughter of Zeus&quot;) by pardoning supplicants. Hebe was also worshipped as a goddess of pardons or forgiveness; freed prisoners would hang their chains in the sacred grove of her sanctuary at Phlius. Pausanias described the Temple of Hebe: &quot;A second hill on which the Phliasians [of Phlios in Argolis] have their citadel and their sanctuary of Hebe.&quot; He also described the cult of Hebe around the sanctuary:

:&quot;On the Phliasian citadel [at Phlios in Argolis] is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorities call her Hebe, whom Homer mentions in the duel between Menelaos (Menelaus) and Alexandros (Alexander), saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of Odysseus to Haides, that she was the wife of Heracles. Olen [a legendary Greek poet], in his hymn to Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Horai (Horae, Seasons), and that her children were Ares and Hebe. Of the honours that the Phliasians pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Kissotomoi (Ivy-cutters). There is no image, either kept in secret of openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of Hera with an image of Parian marble.&quot;

==Ancient art==
In art, Hebe is usually depicted wearing a sleeveless dress, typically she was depicted with either one or both her parents, at her wedding ceremony, or with Aphrodite.

Hebe was occasionally depicted with wings, which has led to confusion by modern scholars on whether depictions of winged female attendants are Hebe, Iris, or Nike. One confirmed depiction of Hebe with wings, as determined by the Η above the figure&#x27;s head, is on a cup by Sosias. Hebe is presumably between enthroned parents as she waits for her future husband Heracles, who directed towards her by Athena, Apollo, and Hermes. Another notable depiction of a winged Hebe is by the Castelgiorgio painter on a cup, who pairs her with her mother and Ganymede analogously with Zeus; Ares stands in the center of the scene indicating familial harmony.

It is possible that she is one of the winged figures from the Parthenon pediment in the British Museum, as the figure stands as an attendant to Hera and is near Zeus and Ares. The figure could also represent Iris or Nike, but contextual evidence arguably makes the identification as Hebe more likely. The depiction of Eros with his mother Aphrodite on the same frieze have been equated to Hebe&#x27;s position to Hera, as the group seems to pay attention to the young maidens approaching from the right side of the eastern frieze. The two pairs were connected with love and weddings/marriage respectively, which would allude to the young maidens who would soon be married. Another possible connection between the pairs is that Hebe and Eros are portrayed as children who are still dependent on their mothers and stay close to them as a result. The identification of the figure as Hebe would also make sense due to the proximity to Zeus and Ares, her father and brother. Ares and Hebe here are represented as the product of a legal marriage, reinforcing the sacred marriage between Zeus and Hera, which gives an example of a prolific marriage to the mortal pair shown in the centre of the eastern frieze.

Hebe may have been the Acroterion on the Temple of Ares in the Athenian Agora. Hebe may have also been depicted on a fragmentary votive relief that was excavated near the Erechtheion, which shows Heracles being crowned by Nike, who places her left arm around another goddess&#x27;s shoulders. However, Hebe was not connected with Nike, leading most scholars to believe this goddess is Athena.

As the goddess of the brides, Hebe was often portrayed in wedding scenes. A notable depiction of Hebe comes from an Archaic Attic Black Figure dions dated to 580 – 570 B.C.E., which is attributed to Sophilos and held in the British Museum, depicts Hebe as part of a procession of gods arriving at the house of Peleus to celebrate his wedding to Thetis. Here Hebe is the most prominent goddess in the procession, appearing alone and without a cloak covering her shoulders like most of the other goddess in attendance. She wears an elaborate dress with the patterns of animals and geometric shapes and wears earrings. Her hair is shown to be bound with three braids worn over her shoulder. Her prominent position may be due to her association with feasts, being the patron of brides, or because a mortal man is marrying a goddess, referencing her own marriage to Heracles. Hebe is also a prominent figure on a 5th-century epinetron by the Eretria Painter depicting preparations for the wedding of Harmonia. The bride sits in the centre of the scene on a stool and is surrounded by her friends who prepare her for her wedding as her mother, Aphrodite, oversees the process. The depiction reinforces Hebe&#x27;s connection to weddings and brides.

==In post-classical art==
Hebe was a remarkably popular subject in art in the period from about 1750 to 1880, having attracted little artistic attention before or after. In the later period, many depictions were portraits of ladies as Hebe, for which at a minimum the only modifications to a normal costume needed were a flowing white dress, some flowers in the hair and a cup to hold. Most artists added an eagle and a setting amid the clouds. In French there was a special term, &quot;en Hébé&quot;, for the costume. The personification appears in rococo, Grand Manner and Neoclassical styles. Even some very aristocratic models allowed a degree of nudity, such as exposing a single breast, though this was often much greater in non-portrait depictions.

Jean-Marc Nattier painted a Rohan princess as Hebe in 1737, and then the royal Louise Henriette of Bourbon, Duchess of Orléans (1744) and another duchess the same year as Hebe, the latter with a breast exposed. François-Hubert Drouais painted Marie-Antoinette, when Dauphine, &quot;en Hébé&quot; in 1773, and Angelica Kauffman and Gaspare Landi both painted several Hebes. Notably, the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; addressed Marie-Antoinette as Hebe upon her marriage. Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun tells in her memoirs how she painted the 16-year-old Miss Anna Pitt, daughter of Thomas Pitt, Lord Camelford, as Hebe in Rome, with a real eagle she borrowed from Cardinal de Bernis. The bird was furious at being brought indoors to her studio and badly frightened her, though it looks relatively harmless in the painting (now in the Hermitage Museum). An entirely nude depiction by Ignaz Unterberger was a huge success in Vienna in 1795, and bought by Emperor Francis II for a large amount; the artist was also made a court painter.

In sculpture Hebe began to flourish as a subject slightly later, but continued longer. Hubert Gerhard created an early statue of Hebe in 1590 that is currently on display at the Detroit Institute of Arts, which depicts her naked, holding her dress in one hand and a cup raised above her head in another. She rests one foot upon a tortoise, a gesture associated with Aphrodite Urania. Antonio Canova sculpted four different versions of his statue of Hebe, and there are many later copies. This had no accompanying eagle, but including the bird was a challenge accepted by several later sculptors. An elaborate marble group with a naked Hebe and the eagle with wings outspread was started in 1852 by the elderly François Rude but unfinished by his death in 1855. Finished by his widow and another it is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon and was very popular in bronze versions, with one in Chicago. Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse produced another spectacular group, with the eagle perched above a sleeping Hebe (1869, now Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris). Jean Coulon (1853–1923) produced another group about 1886, with versions in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice, Nice and the Stanford Museum in California.

Especially in America, figures of Hebe continued to be popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century for garden fountains and temperance fountains, and statues were widely available in cast stone. Tarentum, Pennsylvania, United States displays two such cast stone statues of Hebe. The mold for these statues was donated to the borough by the Tarentum Book Club on 6 June 1912. In Vicksburg, Mississippi, the Bloom Fountain installed in 1927 near the municipal rose garden, thanks to a bequest of $6,500 in the will of Louis Bloom, features a Hebe of cast zinc. At Bowling Green, Kentucky, the Hebe fountain in Fountain Square follows Canova&#x27;s model, in patinated cast iron, purchased in 1881 from the J. L. Mott Iron Works of New York, at a cost of $1500. Similar Hebe fountains, probably also from Mott, are located in Court Square, Memphis, Tennessee and in Montgomery, Alabama, and one with bronze patination was formerly the Starkweather Fountain in Ypsilanti, Michigan, installed in 1889.

There is a bronze statue of Hebe, by Robert Thomas; (1966), in Birmingham city centre, England.

<text>The goblin shark (Mitsukurina owstoni) is a rare species of deep-sea shark. Sometimes called a &quot;living fossil&quot;, it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flat snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger such as one captured in 2000 that is thought to have measured . Goblin sharks are benthopelagic creatures that inhabit upper continental slopes, submarine canyons, and seamounts throughout the world at depths greater than , with adults found deeper than juveniles. Some researchers believe that these sharks could also dive to depths of up to , for short periods of time.

Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor and in the middle of the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.

==Taxonomy==

American ichthyologist David Starr Jordan described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of &quot;Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences&quot;, recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species, but also a new genus and family. He based his account on an immature male caught in Sagami Bay near Yokohama, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by shipmaster and naturalist Alan Owston, who had given it to Professor Kakichi Mitsukuri at the University of Tokyo, who in turn brought it to Jordan. Jordan named the shark &quot;Mitsukurina owstoni&quot; in honor of these two men.

The common name &quot;goblin shark&quot; is a calque of its traditional Japanese name , a  being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.

Soon after Jordan&#x27;s description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between &quot;Mitsukurina&quot; and the extinct Mesozoic shark &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot;. For a time, the prevailing opinion was to treat &quot;Mitsukurina&quot; as a junior synonym of &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot;. Eventually, more complete fossils revealed many anatomical differences between &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Mitsukurina&quot;, causing modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera. Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This taxonomic confusion began because the specimens&#x27; jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences among the heads.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
Phylogenetic studies based on morphology have classified the goblin shark as the most basal member of the order Lamniformes, known as mackerel sharks. Studies using genetic data have also confirmed a basal classification for this species. The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by &quot;Mitsukurina&quot;, &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot;, and &quot;Anomotodon&quot;, dates back to the Aptian age of the Cretaceous period (&quot;c.&quot; 125–113 Ma). &quot;Mitsukurina&quot; itself first appears in the fossil record during the period Middle Eocene (&quot;c.&quot; 49–37 Ma); extinct species include &quot;M. lineata&quot; and &quot;M. maslinensis&quot;. &quot;Striatolamia macrota&quot;, which lived in warm shallow waters during the Paleogene period (&quot;c.&quot; 66–23 Ma), may also be a &quot;Mitsukurina&quot; species. As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several &quot;primitive&quot; traits, the goblin shark has been described as a &quot;living fossil&quot;.

==Description==

The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flat snout, resembling a blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are very protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation of tooth length and width occurs, as for whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and regarding the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.

The body is fairly slender and flabby. The two dorsal fins are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The pelvic and anal fins have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric caudal fin has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe. The soft, semi-translucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of dermal denticles, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. Living sharks of this species are pink or tan due to visible blood vessels beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins&#x27; margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the irises. After death, the coloration fades quickly to dull gray or brown. Adult sharks usually measure between long. However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at long during 2000 showed this species can grow far larger than suspected previously. A 2019 study suggested that it would have reached in maximum length. Until 2022, the maximum weight recorded was for a shark of 3.8 m (12.5 ft) in length. In 2023, a heavily pregnant, individual weighing , was landed in Taiwan. The enormous individual sparked criticism of the fishing method of bottom trawling which was used to catch it.

==Distribution and habitat==
The goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been recorded from the northern Gulf of Mexico, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Brazil in the west, and France, Portugal, Madeira, and Senegal in the east. It has also been collected from seamounts along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the Indo-Pacific and Oceania, it has been found off South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. This species has been recorded from off East Cape to Kaikōura Canyon and from the Challenger Plateau near New Zealand. A single eastern Pacific specimen is known, collected off southern California. This species is most often found over the upper continental slope at depths of . It has been caught as deep as , a tooth has been found lodged in an undersea cable at a depth of , and a live individual was filmed at a depth of in the Tonga Trench. Adults inhabit greater depths than juveniles. Immature goblin sharks frequent the submarine canyons off southern Japan at depths of , with individuals occasionally wandering into inshore waters as shallow as . Two juvenile goblin sharks were captured from the Tokyo Underwater Canyon in Tokyo Bay, filmed in the Kanaya Fishing Port, and released on 30 January 2008 and 24 January 2011. The goblin shark filmed in 2008 was caught at a depth of 150–350m (492–1,148 ft). On 19 April 2014, fishermen in Key West, Florida, while fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, caught a goblin shark in their fishing net, only the second one ever to be caught in the Gulf. The shark was photographed and released back into the water. The first shark found in the Gulf was caught by commercial fisherman on 25 July 2000 at a depth of approximately 919–1,099 m (3,016–3,606 ft) and is thought to have been about 20 ft long. During July 2014, a goblin shark was found in a fishery net in Sri Lanka, near the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The shark was about long and weighed about . The shark was given to the NARA (National Aquatic Resource Research &amp; Development Agency) for further research.

==Biology and ecology==
Although observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly calcified, the muscle blocks along its sides (myomeres) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect the weak electric fields produced by other animals. Due to the snout&#x27;s softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small optic tectum in the shark&#x27;s brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its pupils, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may be the prey of blue sharks (&quot;Prionace glauca&quot;). Parasites documented from this species include the copepod &quot;Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae&quot;, and the tapeworms &quot;Litobothrium amsichensis&quot; and &quot;Marsupiobothrium gobelinus&quot;.

===Feeding===

The goblin shark feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as rattails and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (&quot;Helicolenus dactylopterus&quot;), and midwater species such as the squid &quot;Teuthowenia pellucida&quot; and the ostracod &quot;Macrocypridina castanea rotunda&quot;. Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.

Since it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an ambush predator. Its low-density flesh and large oily liver make it neutrally buoyant, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark&#x27;s specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic ligaments associated with the mandibular joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially &quot;catapult&quot; the jaws forward. At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey. Striking and prey capture events were videotaped and recorded for the first time during 2008 and 2011 and helped to confirm the use and systematics of the protrusible jaws of goblin sharks. The video evidence suggests that while the jaws are definitely unique, goblin sharks use ram feeding, a type of prey capture that is typical of many mackerel sharks. What makes the goblin shark unique is the kinematics of their jaw when feeding. The lower jaw seems to undergo more complex movements and is important in capturing the prey. The measured protrusions of the upper and lower jaw combined put the goblin shark jaws at 2.1–9.5 times more protrusible than other sharks. The lower jaw has a velocity about two times greater than the upper jaw because it not only protrudes forward, but also swings upward to capture the prey, and the maximum velocity of the jaws is 3.14 m/s. The goblin shark has a re-opening and re-closing pattern during the strike, a behavior that has never been seen in other sharks before and could be related to the extent with which the goblin shark protrudes its jaws.

===Growth and reproduction===
The reproductive behaviors of the goblin shark are poorly understood. Mating has never been observed between two goblin sharks. Fishermen in Taiwan captured a pregnant female carrying six pups in 2023. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are viviparous with small litter sizes and embryos that grow during gestation by eating undeveloped eggs (oophagy). The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen. Males mature sexually at about long, while female maturation size is unknown. No data is available concerning growth and aging. Some researchers have estimated, based on their own research and prior findings, that male goblin sharks mature at approximately 16 years old and can live up to 60 years.

==Human interactions==
Given the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses little danger to humans. The first known findings pertaining to the goblin shark were published in 1910. &quot;The new shark is certainly grotesque, [...] the most remarkable feature is the curiously elongated nose.&quot; A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived briefly. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (&quot;Aphanopus carbo&quot;) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. During April 2003, more than a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has categorized the goblin shark as Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity. However, during June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the goblin shark as &quot;At Risk – Naturally Uncommon&quot; with the qualifiers &quot;Data Poor&quot; and &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; using the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<text>Mitsukurinidae is a family of sharks with one living genus, &quot;Mitsukurina&quot;, and four fossil genera: &quot;Anomotodon&quot;, &quot;Protoscapanorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot;, and &quot;Woellsteinia&quot;, though some taxonomists consider &quot;Scapanorhynchus&quot; to be a synonym of &quot;Mitsukurina&quot;. The only known living species is the goblin shark, &quot;Mitsukurina owstoni&quot;.

This family of sharks is named in honour of Kakichi Mitsukuri who brought the holotype of the only species in this family to David Starr Jordan to be scientifically described.

The most distinctive characteristic of the goblin sharks is the long, trowel-shaped, beak-like snout, much longer than those of other sharks. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. They also possess long, jaws. When the jaws are retracted, the shark resembles a sand tiger shark, &quot;Carcharias taurus&quot;, with an unusually long nose. Its nose resembles the nose of a goblin, which is how it received its name. These sharks have only been seen about 50 times since their discovery in 1897.

==Geographic range==
Originally caught in Japan, the range is wide, but not evenly distributed. The majority of known specimens come from bays of Japan while the rest are mostly found off New Zealand, southern Africa, and in the Eastern Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Two specimens have been taken off the Mississippi and California coasts of the United States. Though this probably encompasses the range of Mitsukurina owstoni, sightings are so rare and widespread that the presence of goblin sharks could extend well beyond these areas. (Duffy, 1997; Martin, 1999)

==Behavior==
They are found in the open ocean from near the surface, down to depths of at least 4265 feet (1300 m). Scientists believe that Goblin Sharks are solitary, just like many other shark species. They also think that the fish are most active in the morning and evening. The Goblin Shark primarily feeds on teleost fishes such as rattails and dragonfish. It also eats cephalopods and crustaceans, such as decapods and isopods.

<text>Margaret Jane Pauley (born October 31, 1950) is an American television host and author, active in news reporting since 1972. She first became widely known as Barbara Walters&#x27;s successor on the NBC morning show &quot;Today&quot;, beginning at the age of 25, where she was a co-anchor from 1976 to 1989, at first with Tom Brokaw, and later with Bryant Gumbel; for a short while in the late 1980s she and Gumbel worked with Deborah Norville. In 1989, with her job apparently threatened by Norville&#x27;s addition to the program, she asked to be released from her contract, but her request was denied. Her next regular anchor position was at the network&#x27;s newsmagazine &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; from 1992 to 2003, where she teamed with Stone Phillips.

In 2003, Pauley left NBC News and in 2004–05 hosted &quot;The Jane Pauley Show&quot;, a syndicated daytime talk show which was canceled after one season. In 2009, she began to appear on &quot;The Today Show&quot; as a contributor hosting a weekly segment sponsored by AARP called &quot;Your Life Calling&quot;.

In 2014, Pauley appeared as an interview subject on the CBS program &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;; positive audience response to this segment led to her being hired as a contributor to the show later in 2014. She was elevated to the role of the program&#x27;s host in 2016, succeeding Charles Osgood, once again making her the anchor of a regular morning news program for the first time in over 25 years and becoming her first job as the host of any television program since 2005; she continues in this role as of 2024.

Pauley has publicly acknowledged her struggle with bipolar disorder. She is married to the cartoonist Garry Trudeau, creator of the comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot;.

==Early life==
Margaret Jane Pauley was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on October 31, 1950. She is a fifth-generation Hoosier and the second child of Richard Grandison Pauley and Mary E. (née Patterson) Pauley. Her father was a traveling salesman, and her mother was a homemaker. According to her memoir, &quot;Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue&quot;, Pauley described herself as such a shy little kid she allowed her second-grade teacher to call her Margaret Pauley all year rather than tell her she preferred her middle name, Jane. Pauley grew up idolizing her older sister, Ann, who has been her closest confidante since childhood.

A speech and debate champion at Warren Central High School in Indianapolis, Pauley placed first in the Girls&#x27; Extemporaneous Speaking division of the National Forensic League in Indiana. After graduating from high school in 1968, Pauley attended Indiana University Bloomington, majoring in political science. She was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma where she sang with the sorority jug band, the Kappa Pickers. She graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 1972.

After three years at WISH-TV, in 1975, Pauley joined veteran anchor Floyd Kalber at NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV to become Chicago&#x27;s first woman co-anchor on a major evening newscast, marking the beginning of her career with NBC. Barely ten months later, Pauley was chosen to replace Barbara Walters on the &quot;Today&quot; show.

==Career==
===&quot;Today&quot;===
Pauley co-hosted the &quot;Today&quot; show from 1976 to December 29, 1989; first with Tom Brokaw from 1976 to December 1981 and then with Bryant Gumbel beginning January 4, 1982. She also anchored the Sunday edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; from 1980 to 1982; and often substituted for the weekend editions 1996-1999.
Following in the footsteps of the first female co-anchor of the show, Barbara Walters, she became a symbol for professional women, and more specifically, female journalists. In 1983, after giving birth to twins following a very public pregnancy, Pauley became a role model to working mothers. In her autobiography, &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, Pauley&#x27;s colleague Linda Ellerbee wrote, &quot;She [Pauley] is what I want to be when I grow up.&quot; The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote on September 27, 1989, that Jane Pauley in some ways represents the best of women in television, that she never took it too seriously, that she knew the difference between television and real life, and that her family counted more than her ratings.

1989 brought big changes to &quot;Today&quot; when news reader Deborah Norville was given a larger role in the two hour broadcast. Speculation in the media implied that NBC executives were easing Pauley out to advance the younger NBC newscaster. As Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote at the time, watching Ms. Pauley, Ms. Norville, and co-anchor Bryant Gumbel on the set together &quot;is like looking at a broken marriage with the home-wrecker right there on the premises.&quot;

Pauley, who had been contemplating a change, hoping to spend more time with her three children, asked to settle her contract, but NBC declined. In October 1989, after prolonged negotiations, Pauley announced that, after 13 years, she would leave the &quot;Today&quot; show in December, but would soon begin working on other projects at NBC. Public reaction amid the perception that Pauley was being cast aside for a younger woman was swift and consequential. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on February 26, 1990, in the three weeks since January 26, the &quot;Today&quot; show lost 10 percent of its audience. Since Jane Pauley left as co-host and Deborah Norville replaced her, the &quot;Today&quot; show had fallen from its leadership position in the competition among the three network morning shows to a distant second place, almost a full rating point behind ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

A July 23, 1990 &quot;New York Magazine&quot; article entitled &quot;Back From the Brink, Jane Pauley Has Become America&#x27;s Favorite Newswoman&quot; reported that from February 1989 to February 1990, &quot;Today&quot; experienced a ratings slump of 22% and the cost to the network and its affiliates was estimated by one insider at close to $10 million for the year.

After Pauley announced she was leaving &quot;Today&quot;, she received more than 4000 letters of support, including one from Michael Kinsley, then of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, which anointed her &quot;heroine of my generation. The first Baby Boomer they tried to put out to pasture … and failed.&quot;

Pauley&#x27;s image was run on the cover of many magazines those months, including the December 1989 cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine with the headline &quot;Our Loss, Her Dream: How Jane Pauley got what she wanted – time for her kids, prime time for herself&quot;. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; dubbed her &quot;The Loved One&quot; on its July 23, 1990 cover.

Pauley returned to the air in a March 13, 1990, NBC primetime special appropriately titled &quot;Changes: Conversations with Jane Pauley.&quot; As she said during the introduction, &quot;Change is not always an option. Change is not always the right choice. But change is almost always the most interesting.&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the one-hour broadcast won its Tuesday 10pm time slot with a 13.3 national Nielsen rating and a 24 percent audience share.

In 1990, Pauley co-hosted the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards, alongside Candice Bergen and Jay Leno, and began to serve as substitute anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

The success of &quot;Changes&quot; launched five one-hour specials in the summer of 1990 called &quot;Real Life with Jane Pauley&quot;. They were also ratings hits, and in January 1991 NBC launched the half hour series &quot;Real Life with Jane Pauley&quot; on Sunday nights. The show was cancelled after one season in October 1991.

===&quot;Dateline NBC&quot;===
On March 31, 1992, NBC launched &quot;Dateline&quot;, its 18th attempt at a newsmagazine. Pauley co-anchored &quot;Dateline&quot; from 1992 to 2003 along with Stone Phillips. &quot;Dateline&quot; made its own news on February 9, 1993, when at the end of a regularly scheduled edition of &quot;Dateline&quot;, Pauley and Phillips delivered a public apology to General Motors on behalf of NBC as part of the settlement of a lawsuit regarding the failure to disclose the use of an incendiary device in a story about the safety of a General Motors pickup truck which aired on &quot;Dateline&quot; on November 17, 1992. Neither Pauley nor Phillips had any connection to the segment; an internal investigation resulted in the resignation of the NBC News president, along with the dismissal of &quot;Dateline&quot; executive producer and others involved with the GM story. &quot;Dateline&quot; survived, went on to thrive, and at one point was on the air five nights a week.

In addition to her &quot;Dateline&quot; responsibilities, Pauley also anchored &quot;Time and Again&quot;, a half hour show airing on then-fledgling MSNBC that recounted major news stories with footage from the NBC News archives.

In 2003, Pauley surprised NBC by declining to renegotiate her expiring contract. Explaining her decision, Pauley said at the time, &quot;I think women think a lot about cycles, biological and personal. This year another cycle came around: my contract was up. It seemed an opportunity to take a life audit. I keep walking by bookstores and seeing titles talking about second acts in life.&quot;

===&quot;The Jane Pauley Show&quot;===
Pauley&#x27;s decision to leave &quot;Dateline&quot; resulted in the offer of a daytime talk show. In 2004, she returned to television as host of &quot;The Jane Pauley Show&quot;, a syndicated daytime talk show distributed by NBC Universal. Although &quot;The Jane Pauley Show&quot; never gained traction in the ratings and was canceled after one season, Pauley called it the hardest – and proudest – year of her professional life. &quot;To try something that you&#x27;ve failed at is, in my experience, proving that you had the guts to try.&quot;

The same year Pauley launched her talk show, she published her bestselling memoir, &quot;Skywriting: A Life Out of the Blue&quot;, in which she made public her diagnosis of bipolar disorder. She said her choice to talk openly about the disorder is &quot;the easiest decision I ever made.&quot; In the January 20, 2014 edition of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, she said, &quot;Part of my advocacy is not talking about the stigma. It&#x27;s real, but it doesn&#x27;t help move us forward. My other message is, I take my meds every day. No holidays. I&#x27;ve not had a recurrence.&quot;

Following the show&#x27;s cancellation, Pauley&#x27;s appearances on television included leading a half-hour discussion on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Depression: Out of the Shadows&quot;, which aired in May 2008. She also campaigned publicly for President Obama in her home state of Indiana in 2008, a year when she was not affiliated with any network news organization.

===Return to &quot;Today&quot;===
In March 2009, Pauley returned to the &quot;Today&quot; show as a contributor hosting a weekly segment, &quot;Your Life Calling,&quot; sponsored by AARP, which profiled people throughout the country age 50+ who were reinventing their lives in new and different ways. The award-winning series was on the air through 2013 and culminated in Pauley&#x27;s second New York Times best-seller, &quot;Your Life Calling: Reimagining the Rest of Your Life&quot;.

On December 30, 2013, Pauley, former &quot;Today&quot; co-host Bryant Gumbel, then-&quot;Today&quot; anchor Matt Lauer, and weather anchor Al Roker (who was live in Pasadena, California) reunited to co-host a special reunion edition of &quot;Today&quot;.

===CBS===
On April 27, 2014, following an appearance during a &quot;where are they now&quot; segment and interview on &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot;, Pauley began contributing to the show as a correspondent and occasional substitute host. Pauley has been a guest host on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; and has also filled in for Scott Pelley on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. It was announced on September 25, 2016, that Pauley would take over as host of &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; following the retirement of Charles Osgood. &quot;We first got to know Jane when we did a story about her on &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot;&quot; said Rand Morrison, the show&#x27;s executive producer, in a statement. &quot;Our viewers immediately responded by suggesting she belonged on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; permanently. And – as is so often the case, they were right. She&#x27;s a dedicated, experienced broadcast journalist. But – every bit as important – she&#x27;s a delight to work with. A worthy successor – and a perfect fit.&quot;

Pauley began her role as host on October 9, 2016, nearly 40 years to the day since her debut on &quot;Today&quot;.

The center serves local communities, including students and their families, regardless of insurance or income, with an emphasis on integrating medical, dental and behavioral health. There are 15 centers, most on the east side of Indianapolis where Pauley grew up.

<doc id="318084" wikidata="Q1172213" url="?curid=318084" title="Data East">
<text>, also abbreviated as DECO, was a Japanese video game, pinball and electronic engineering company. The company was in operation from 1976 to 2003, and released 150 video game titles. At one time, the company had annual sales of 20 billion yen in the United States alone but eventually went bankrupt. The American subsidiary, Data East USA, was headquartered in San Jose, California. Its main headquarters were located in Suginami, Tokyo.

The majority of Data East&#x27;s video games, its trademark and logo, are owned today by the mobile gaming company G-Mode, a subsidiary of Marvelous. A small number of Data East video games are owned by other companies, notably Paon DP.

==History==
Data East was founded on April 20, 1976, by Tokai University alumnus Tetsuo Fukuda. Data East developed and released in July 1977 its first arcade game &quot;Jack Lot&quot;, a medal game based on Blackjack for business use. This was followed in January 1978 by &quot;Super Break&quot; which was its first actual video game. More than 15 arcade games were released by Data East in the 1970s.

Data East established its U.S. division in June 1979. In 1980, Data East published &quot;Astro Fighter&quot; which became its first major arcade game title. While making games, Data East released a series of interchangeable systems compatible with its arcade games, notably the DECO Cassette System which soon became infamous among users due to technical problems. Data East dropped the DECO Cassette by 1985. It was the first interchangeable arcade system board, developed in 1979 and released in 1980, inspiring later arcade conversion systems such as Sega&#x27;s Convert-a-Game in 1981 and the Nintendo VS. System in 1984. Data East abandoned the DECO Cassette System in favor of dedicated arcade cabinets, bringing Data East greater success over the next several years, starting with the hit title &quot;BurgerTime&quot; (1982).

In 1981, three staff members of Data East founded Technōs Japan, who then supported Data East for a while before becoming completely independent.

In 1983, the company moved its headquarters to a new building in Ogikubo, Suginami, where it stayed for the remaining of its lifespan. In March 1985, Data East Europe was established in London. Data East continued to release arcade video games over the next 15 years following the video game crash of 1983.

Data East distributed three major arcade hits in North America between 1984 and 1985: the fighting game &quot;Karate Champ&quot; (1984), the beat &#x27;em up title &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984), and the run and gun video game &quot;Commando&quot; (1985). These three titles catapulted Data East to the forefront of the amusement arcade industry in the mid-1980s. &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; and &quot;Commando&quot; were the top three highest-grossing arcade games of 1985 in the United States. &quot;Karate Champ&quot; was the first successful fighting game, and one of the most influential to modern fighting game standards. Some of Data East&#x27;s other most famous coin-op arcade games from its 1980s heyday include &quot;Heavy Barrel&quot;, &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot;, &quot;Sly Spy&quot;, &quot;RoboCop&quot;, &quot;Bump &#x27;n&#x27; Jump&quot;, &quot;Trio The Punch – Never Forget Me...&quot;, &quot;Karnov&quot; and &quot;Atomic Runner Chelnov&quot;.

Data East also purchased licenses to manufacture and sell arcade games created by other companies. Some of its licensed games included &quot;Kid Niki: Radical Ninja&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; and &quot;Vigilante&quot;, all licensed from Irem, and &quot;Commando&quot;, licensed from Capcom. It had a brief stint as a Neo Geo arcade licensee in the mid-1990s, starting with &quot;Spinmaster&quot; and co-published with SNK.

Following its arcade success, Data East made a successful entry in the home computer game market with a 1985 port of &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, which became the first home computer game to sell more than 500,000 copies in the United States by January 1989. It became the subject of the litigation &quot;Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.&quot;, in which Data East alleged that the computer game &quot;International Karate&quot; (1985), published by Epyx, infringed the copyright of &quot;Karate Champ&quot;.

Data East entered the video game console market in 1986 with the release of &quot;B-Wings&quot; for the Famicom. In North America, the subsidiary Data East USA was the first licensee announced for the Nintendo Entertainment System and consequently was one of the four original third-party publishers to release games for the console in late 1986. In Japan, Data East would become a licensee for several home systems over the years, notably the Famicom (1986), PC Engine (1988), Game Boy (1990), Mega Drive (1991), Super NES (1991), Neo Geo (1993), Sega Saturn (1995), PlayStation (1996), WonderSwan (1999) and NeoGeo Pocket Color (1999). Several of Data East&#x27;s video games series, such as &quot;Tantei Jingūji Saburō&quot;, &quot;Glory of Hercules&quot; and &quot;Metal Max&quot;, were created specifically for home consoles. Data East had a good relationship with Ocean Software to publish titles for the American market throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, even before Ocean started its own American arm led by Data East boss Ray Musci.

Data East also made pinball machines from 1987 through 1994, and included innovations such as the first pinball to have stereo sound (&quot;Laser War&quot;), the first usage of a small dot-matrix display in &quot;Checkpoint&quot; along with the first usage of a big DMD (192x64) in &quot;Maverick&quot;. In designing pinball machines they showed a strong preference for using high-profile (but expensive) licensed properties, rather than creating totally original machines, which did not help the financial difficulties the company began experiencing from 1990 on. Some of the properties that Data East licensed for its pinball machines included &quot;Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;RoboCop&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Data East is the only company that manufactured custom pinball games (e.g., for Aaron Spelling, the movie &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, or Michael Jordan), though these were basically mods of existing or soon to be released pinball machines (e.g., &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;). The pinball division was created in 1985 by purchasing the pinball division of Stern Electronics and its factory and assets. Amidst plummeting sales across the entire pinball market, Data East chose to exit the pinball business and sold the factory to Sega in 1994. At the time of the buyout by Sega, Data East Pinball was the world&#x27;s second-largest pinball manufacturer, holding 25 percent of the market. Although all of Data East&#x27;s pinball games were developed in the United States, several were released in Japan by the parent company.

Although video games represented the majority of the company&#x27;s revenue, Data East had always been involved in engineering. Outside of video games, Data East produced image transmission equipment, data communication adapters for satellite phones from NTT DoCoMo, and developed electrocardiogram equipment for ambulances. According to the company&#x27;s website, its Datafax product, released in 1983, was the world&#x27;s first portable fax machine.

By the end of the 1990s, the company&#x27;s American division, Data East USA, was liquidated. No official announcement of this was made; instead, calls to Data East USA&#x27;s offices were greeted with a prerecorded message from marketing manager Jay Malpas stating that the company had closed its doors before Christmas 1996. Its final releases were &quot;Defcon 5&quot; and &quot;Creature Shock: Special Edition&quot;. The Japanese parent company itself announced its departure from the arcade industry entirely on December 4, 1997 and had accumulated a debt estimated at 3.3 billion yen. Data East filed for reorganization in 1999 and stopped making video games altogether. All customer support pertaining to video games was halted in March 2000. For the following three years, Data East sold negative ion generators, continued to develop compatible devices for NTT DoCoMo phones and licensed some of its old video games to other companies. Nonetheless, the company&#x27;s restructuring efforts were not enough to put back the financial problems brought by the 1990s. Consequently, in April 2003, Data East filed for bankruptcy and was finally declared bankrupt by a Tokyo district court on June 25, 2003. The news was released to the public two weeks later, on July 8.

Most of Data East&#x27;s video game library was acquired in February 2004 by G-Mode, a Japanese mobile gaming company that is now owned by Marvelous. G-Mode also owns the Data East trademark. However, some games are owned by Paon DP instead of G-Mode, notably &quot;Karnov&quot;, &quot;Chelnov&quot;, &quot;Windjammers&quot;, the &quot;Glory of Heracles&quot; series and the &quot;Kuuga&quot; trilogy. Likewise, the rights to the series &quot;Metal Max&quot; and &quot;Jake Hunter&quot; currently are the properties of Kadokawa Games and Arc System Works, respectively. The &quot;RoboCop&quot; titles related to Data East were acquired by D4 Enterprise in September 2010. The other properties of Data East were transferred to the asset management company of the Fukuda family. The latter sued Nintendo twice during the 2000s for patent infringement, but both cases were dismissed. Data East&#x27;s former building in Ogikubo, which was located in an area largely residential, was demolished around 2014 and replaced by an apartment or condominium construction. Founder Tetsuo Fukuda was still active in 2017 as president of a medical company he established in December 2015 at the age of 76.

<text>Werner Klemperer (March 22, 1920 – December 6, 2000) was an American actor. He was known for playing Colonel Wilhelm Klink on the CBS television sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, for which he twice won the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the Primetime Emmy Awards in 1968 and 1969.

After serving in the United States Army during World War II, he began performing on the Broadway stage in 1947. Klemperer then appeared in several films during his early acting career such as &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956), &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), and &quot;Houseboat&quot; (1958), and numerous roles on television shows such as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1956), &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957), &quot;Maverick&quot; (1957), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1958), &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1960), and &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; (1961), prior to his &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; role.

==Early life==
Klemperer was born in Cologne, Germany, to a musical family but he said that he had little musical aptitude. His father was renowned orchestra conductor Otto Klemperer and his mother was soprano Johanna Geisler. He had a younger sister named Lotte (1923–2003). His father was Jewish by birth; he converted to Catholicism but later returned to Judaism. His mother was Lutheran. His grandfather was part of the Jewish community in Prague, and his grandmother was a Sephardic Jew from Hamburg, Germany. Otto Klemperer was a first cousin of Victor Klemperer.

The Klemperer family emigrated to the United States in 1933, settling in Los Angeles, where Otto Klemperer became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1933–1939). Werner Klemperer began acting as a student at University High School and enrolled in acting courses at the Pasadena Playhouse before joining the United States Army to serve in World War II. While stationed in Hawaii, he joined the Army&#x27;s Special Services unit, spending the next years touring the Pacific entertaining the troops. 

After the war, he performed on Broadway, appearing in &quot;Heads or Tails&quot; and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Galileo&quot;, both in 1947, the comedy &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur in 1951, and &quot;Dear Charles&quot;, another comedy, in 1955.

==Career==
Klemperer&#x27;s first major film role was as a psychiatrist in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Man&quot; (1956). Earlier that year in &quot;Death of a Scoundrel&quot; he had a smaller role as the lawyer of the hero/villain portrayed by George Sanders. He played a German government officer in the 1959 episode, &quot;The Haunted U-Boat&quot;, of the series &quot;One Step Beyond.&quot; Also in 1959, he appeared as a Frenchman in the episode &quot;Fragile&quot; of the Western TV series &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;. He received significant notice for his role in the award-winning 1961 film &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;. The film presents a fictionalized account of the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, with Klemperer portraying Emil Hahn, a Nazi prosecutor and one of the defendants at the trial. Prior to this, he had a small role in the 1957 Errol Flynn film &quot;Istanbul&quot; and a pivotal part in the &quot;Comstock Conspiracy&quot; episode of &quot;Maverick&quot; that same year. He played the title role in the 1961 film &quot;Operation Eichmann&quot;, opposite his future co-star John Banner. 

Klemperer guest-starred in the first Brian Keith television series, &quot;Crusader&quot;, a Cold War drama that aired on CBS. During this time, he made three guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;: he played East German murder victim Stefan Riker in the 1958 episode &quot;The Case of the Desperate Daughter&quot;; the East European character Ulrik Zenas in the 1963 episode &quot;The Case of the Two-Faced Turn-a-bout&quot;; and Police Inspector Hurt in 1964 in &quot;The Case of a Place Called Midnight&quot;. In 1963, Klemperer also portrayed a professor of psychology in &quot;The Dream Book&quot;, an episode on the sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. He played Lt. Huebner in the 1965 film &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, in which he tells Mrs. Mary Treadwell, played by Vivien Leigh, that her life &quot;ends by sitting in a nightclub with a paid escort who tells [her] the lies [she wants] to hear.&quot;

Prior to &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, Klemperer appeared in the 1956 episode &quot;Safe Conduct&quot; of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, along with John Banner; twice appeared as Hugo on the syndicated romantic comedy series, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1957–1959), with Barbara Eden and Merry Anders; and appeared on the &quot;Purple Gang&quot; episode of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

===&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; era===
Klemperer is best known, however, as Colonel Wilhelm Klink: the bungling, cowardly, conceited, and self-serving Kommandant of Stalag 13 on &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS from 1965 to 1971. Klemperer, conscious that he would be playing the role of a German officer during the Nazi regime, accepted the part only on the condition that Klink would be portrayed as a fool who never succeeded. According to co-star Richard Dawson, Klemperer supplied his own uniforms. When Klemperer&#x27;s father, the famous conductor Otto Klemperer, saw his first episode of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, he said to his son, &quot;Your work is good, but who is the author of this material?&quot; In addition to the character&#x27;s bumblings, Klink was also remembered for his excruciatingly bad violin playing. For his performance as Klink, Klemperer received six Emmy Award nominations for best supporting actor, winning successive awards in 1968 and 1969.

Klemperer made a cameo appearance in character as Klink in the &quot;Batman&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s How You Play the Game&quot; and as Officer Bolix in the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; episode &quot;All That Glitters&quot; in 1966. He played a bumbling East German official in the 1968 American comedy film &quot;The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz&quot;, directed by George Marshall and starring Elke Sommer and several of his costars from &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, including Bob Crane and John Banner. Klemperer later starred in &quot;Wake Me When the War Is Over&quot; in 1969, playing the role of a German major, Erich Mueller, alongside Eva Gabor. He also played a villain in an episode of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; titled &quot;The Blizzard Makers&quot;.

==Later career==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1973, Klemperer returned to Broadway, appearing in &quot;The Night of the Tribades&quot; in 1977. He expanded his acting career with musical roles in opera, and earned a Best Featured Actor Tony Award nomination. nomination for his performance in &quot;Cabaret&quot; in its 1987 Broadway revival, playing &quot;Herr Schultz&quot;. 

A member of the board of directors of the New York Chamber Symphony, Klemperer served as a narrator with many other American symphony orchestras including the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra. He also made occasional guest appearances on television dramas, and took part in a few studio recordings, notably a version of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot; with the Boston Symphony and Seiji Ozawa, in 1979. From 1979 to 1982, he appeared as Bassa Selim in 18 performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Singspiel&quot; &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In 1981, he appeared, to critical and audience raves, as Prince Orlofsky in Seattle Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. 

In 1990, he narrated the children&#x27;s story &quot;Gerald McBoing Boing&quot; (music by Gail Kubik) for a CD of classical music for children. In January 1991 he performed as narrator in the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s concerts and subsequent Koss Classics recording of &quot;Lelio&quot;, by Hector Berlioz, in an English translation. In 1992, he made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Starstruck&quot;, as the father of an attempted murder suspect.

In 1993, Klemperer reprised the role of Klink in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as Homer&#x27;s guardian angel and spirit guide in the episode &quot;The Last Temptation of Homer&quot;. According to the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary, when Klemperer appeared, he had to be given a quick reminder of how to play Colonel Klink. He declined other offers to reprise the character, including one from talk-show host Conan O&#x27;Brien.

Klemperer made his final appearance on Broadway in 1995 in the Circle in the Square production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, in which he played Professor Serebryakov.

Klemperer appeared in several episodes of the news/talk show &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;.

For many years, Klemperer was an elected member of the council of Actors&#x27; Equity Association, and was a vice president of the union at the time of his death.

<text>Supermercado De Candido is a chain of supermarkets, located in the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela.

The supermarket company was established in 1950, when the Italian Prati Caruso brothers established it as Supermercado La Franco Italiana. 

During the company&#x27;s first few years, growth was slow, but when petroleum companies Royal Dutch/Shell and Creole Petroleum Corporation merged the Paraguaná Peninsula experienced significant economic and population growth, inspiring &quot;La Franco Italiana&quot; to expand. In 1974 the company&#x27;s name changed officially from &quot;La Franco Italiana&quot; to &quot;Supermercado La Franco Italiana S.A.&quot;.

In 1989 the company inaugurated what was, as of 2003, the largest supermarket store in Venezuela.

Many people in the Paraguaná Peninsula still refer to the company as &quot;La Franco&quot;.

The supermarket got sold due to economic and security problems. It got sold to the company &quot;De Candido&quot; which has several supermarkets in the country. It is now called &quot;De Candido&quot;.

<text>ABC News is the news division of the American television network ABC. Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast &quot;ABC World News Tonight with David Muir&quot;; other programs include morning news-talk show &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;Primetime&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, and Sunday morning political affairs program &quot;This Week with George Stephanopoulos&quot;. In addition to the division&#x27;s television programs, ABC News has radio and digital outlets, including ABC News Radio and ABC News Live, plus various podcasts hosted by ABC News personalities. ABC News advertises itself as &quot;America&#x27;s #1 news source.&quot;

==History==
===20th-century origins===
ABC began in 1943 as the NBC Blue Network, a radio network that was spun off from NBC, as ordered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1942. The reason for the order was to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the United States, specifically news and political broadcasting, and broaden the projected points of view. Only a few companies, such as NBC and CBS, dominated the radio market. NBC conducted the split voluntarily in case its appeal of the ruling was denied, and it was forced to split its two networks into separate companies.

Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial owned-and-operated television station (WJZ-TV, now WABC-TV) and production center in New York City in August 1948. Broadcasts continued as the ABC network expanded nationwide. Until the early 1970s, ABC News programs and ABC in general consistently ranked third in viewership behind CBS and NBC news programs. ABC had fewer affiliate stations and a weaker prime-time programming slate to support the network&#x27;s news operations compared to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.

===Roone Arledge===
By the 1970s, the network had effectively turned around, with its prime-time entertainment programs achieving more substantial ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits for ABC overall. With the appointment of the president of ABC Sports, Roone Arledge as president of ABC News in 1977, ABC invested the resources to make it a significant source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast &quot;model&quot;, created many of ABC News&#x27; most popular and enduring programs, including &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;World News Tonight&quot;, &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot;, and &quot;Primetime Live&quot;. ABC News&#x27; longtime slogan, &quot;More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source.&quot; (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.

In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), Nine Network and ITN sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the Associated Press. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service, Associated Press Television News (APTV), while providing material from ABC&#x27;s news video service, ABC News One, to APTV.

===1985 Marilyn Monroe scandal===
Scandal erupted in 1985 over a decision by Arledge, president of ABC News and Sports, to kill a 13-minute report about Marilyn Monroe, possibly due to his close ties to Ethel Kennedy. &quot;20/20&quot; drew criticism from the program&#x27;s co-anchors, Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters, and the executive producer, Av Westin. Arledge said that he had killed the piece because it was &quot;gossip-column stuff&quot; and &quot;does not live up to its billing.&quot; Downs, however, took issue with Arledge&#x27;s judgment. &quot;I am upset about the way it was handled,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;I honestly believe that this is more carefully documented than anything any network did during Watergate. I lament the fact that the decision reflects badly on people I respect and it reflects badly on me and the broadcast.&quot; Additionally, Westin said: &quot;I don&#x27;t anticipate not putting it on the air. The journalism is solid. Everything in there has two sources. We are documenting that there was a relationship between Bobby and Marilyn and Jack and Marilyn. A variety of eyewitnesses attest to that on camera.&quot; Two other aspects of the unaired report, according to an ABC staff member who has seen it, are eyewitness accounts of wiretapping of Monroe&#x27;s home by Jimmy Hoffa, the teamster leader, that reveal meetings between her and the Kennedy brothers, and accounts of a visit to Monroe by Robert F. Kennedy on the day of her death. Fred Otash, a detective who said he was the chief wiretapper, is interviewed on camera, and ABC staff members said three other wiretappers corroborated his account. In addition, several people not in the book say on camera that Monroe kept diaries with references to meetings with the Kennedy brothers, according to a staff member who has seen the report. &quot;It set out to be a piece which would demonstrate that because of alleged relations between Robert Kennedy and John F. Kennedy and Monroe, the presidency was compromised because organized crime was involved,&quot; he said. &quot;Based on what has been uncovered so far, there was no evidence.&quot; Arledge&#x27;s decision to kill the broadcast resulted in the subsequent decision of Geraldo Rivera to leave ABC entirely. Rivera was a &quot;20/20&quot; correspondent but did not work on that story. He had been publicly critical of Arledge&#x27;s decision. Arledge, a champion and defender of Rivera, said he thought the story needed more work. The story probed purported affairs between actress Marilyn Monroe, President John F. Kennedy, and his brother Robert F. Kennedy.

===21st century===
On August 7, 2014, ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division, ABC Radio, on January 1, 2015. The change occurred following the announcement that Cumulus would replace its ABC News radio service with Westwood One News (via CNN). On September 20, 2019, ABC Radio was renamed as ABC Audio as the network has evolved to offer a podcast portfolio and other forms of on-demand and linear content.

In April 2018, it was announced that &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; would be transferred to ABC News from ESPN, Inc., majority owned by The Walt Disney Company. On September 10, 2018, ABC News launched a second attempt to extend its &quot;Good Morning America&quot; brand into the afternoon with &quot;GMA3: What You Need to Know&quot;. In May 2019, &quot;ABC News Live&quot;, a news focused streaming channel, was launched on Roku. Following a reorganization of ABC&#x27;s parent company, The Walt Disney Company which created the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News Digital and Live Streaming, including &quot;ABC News Live&quot; and &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, were transferred to the new segment.

In an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, ABC News was ranked the second most trusted news organization by Americans, behind &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

In December 2024, ABC&#x27;s owner, the Walt Disney Company, settled a defamation lawsuit brought by Donald Trump against ABC News, by agreeing to donate $15 million to Trump&#x27;s future presidential library foundation and paying $1 million in Trump&#x27;s legal fees. Disney also agreed to ABC and anchor George Stephanopoulos publishing a statement saying they regretted that Stephanopoulos, in an interview with Trump, had repeatedly said that Trump had been found liable for raping E. Jean Carroll.

==Other services==

===ABC News Radio===

ABC News Radio is the radio service of ABC Audio, a division of the ABC News. Formerly known as ABC Radio News, ABC News Radio feeds through Skyview Networks with newscasts on the hour to its affiliates. ABC News Radio is the largest commercial radio news organization in the US.

===ABCNews.com===
ABCNews.com launched on May 15, 1997, by ABC News Internet Ventures, a joint venture between Starwave and ABC formed in April 1997. Starwave had owned and operated ESPNet SportsZone (later known as ESPN.com) since 1995, which licensed the ESPN brand and video clips from ABC&#x27;s corporate sister ESPN Inc. Disney wanted more control of their Internet properties, which meant ABCNews.com was operated as a joint venture with ABC News having editorial control. Disney had also bought a minority stake in Starwave before the launch of ABCNews.com and would later buy the company outright.

The website initially had a dedicated staff of about 30. In addition to articles, it featured short video clips and audio from the start, delivered using RealAudio and RealVideo technology. Some content was also available via America Online. In 2011, ABC News and Yahoo News announced a strategic partnership to share ABC&#x27;s online reporting on Yahoo&#x27;s website; the deal expanded in 2015 to include the Disney/ABC Television Group. In 2018, ABC News, and Good Morning America specifically, ended the hosting partnership with Yahoo, instead opting to continue separate web presences. Although Disney retired the Go.com branding in 2013, ABC News&#x27; website has the Go.com branding, with its URL reading ABCNews.Go.com.

===ABC News Live===

ABC News Live is a 24/7 streaming video news channel for breaking news, live events, newscasts and longer-form reports and documentaries operated by ABC News since 2018, The channel is available through Roku, Hulu, Disney+, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Pluto TV, Xumo, FuboTV and the news division&#x27;s other streaming platforms. The service is under the direction of Justin Dial, Vice President of Streaming Content, Seniboye Tienabeso, Executive Director of ABC News Live, Chandra Zeikel, Executive Producer &amp; Eric Ortega, Executive Producer.

This unit is producing:

* &quot;ABC News Live&quot;, a daily three hour afternoon show anchored by Kyra Phillips from 1:00–4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time)
* &quot;ABC News Live Reports&quot;, a daily two hour afternoon show anchored by Kayna Whitworth from 5:00–7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) (September 2023-)

* &quot;GMA3: What You Need To Know&quot;, a weekday, hour-long daytime news program on ABC. It premiered in March 2020 as &quot;Pandemic: What You Need To Know&quot;, as a temporary replacement for its talk show &quot;Strahan, Sara and Keke&quot; to cover the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic in the United States. It has since replaced indefinitely. The program is currently anchored by Eva Pilgrim, DeMarco Morgan and joined by ABC News chief medical correspondent Jennifer Ashton.

===Former===

====Satellite News Channel====

Satellite News Channel was a joint venture between ABC News and Group W that launched on June 21, 1982, as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and seven Washington, D.C.–based crews and stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, CNN (a subsidiary of Time Warner&#x27;s Turner Broadcasting System). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel&#x27;s operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or CNN2 on most cable systems.

====ABC News Now====
ABC News Now was a 24-hour cable news network that launched on July 26, 2004, as a digital subchannel by ABC News, being the company&#x27;s second attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after Satellite News Channel. It was offered via digital television, broadband and streaming video at ABCNews.com and on mobile phones. It delivered breaking news, headline news each half hour, and a wide range of entertainment and lifestyle programming. The channel was available in the United States and Europe. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their input by submitting videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel after its experimental phase ended with the Presidential inauguration in 2005. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with Fusion on October 28, 2013.

====Fusion====

Fusion was a digital cable and satellite network owned and operated by Fusion Media Group, LLC, which was a joint venture between ABC News and Univision Communications. ABC and Univision formally announced their launch on May 2, 2012. Launched on October 28, 2013, Fusion features a mix of traditional news and investigative programs along with satirical content aimed at English-speaking Hispanic and Latino American adults between the ages of 18 and 34. The network replaced ABC News Now, a mainly streaming service of ABC News content. In December 2015, it was reported that Disney was in talks to sell its stake in Fusion to Univision. The split was complete on April 21, 2016; Univision alone would continue to operate Fusion until December 31, 2021, when it shut down the network.

In Australia, Sky News Australia airs daily broadcasts of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; (at 10:30 a.m.) and &quot;Nightline&quot; (at 1:30 a.m.) as well as weekly airings of &quot;20/20&quot; (on Wednesdays at 1:30 p.m., with an extended version at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally &quot;Primetime&quot; (at 1:30 p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00 p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country&#x27;s public broadcasting, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, operates its unrelated news division that is also named ABC News. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content-sharing agreement with the Nine Network, which also broadcasts &quot;GMA&quot; domestically in the early morning before its own breakfast program.

In New Zealand, &quot;ABC World News&quot; was broadcast daily at 5:10 p.m. and again at 11:35 p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., TVNZ 7 (owned by Television New Zealand) aired the program commercial-free until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.

<text>Jorge Antonio Bell Mathey (born October 21, 1959), better known as George Bell, is a Dominican former left fielder and American League MVP in Major League Baseball who played 12 seasons for the Toronto Blue Jays (1981, 1983–1990), Chicago Cubs (1991) and Chicago White Sox (1992–1993). Bell batted and threw right-handed.

==Career==
Originally signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1978, Bell was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 1980 Rule 5 draft. Bell was discovered in the Dominican Republic by Blue Jays scout Epy Guerrero. He made his major league debut as a pinch runner on April 9, 1981, against the Detroit Tigers. Bell appeared in 60 games during the 1981 season, batting .233 with five home runs and 12 runs batted in (RBI). In 1982, he spent the season with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, where he hit just .200 with three home runs and 19 RBI in 37 games. In 1983, he split the season between Syracuse and Toronto. With the Blue Jays, Bell batted .268 with two home runs and 17 RBI in 39 games. In 85 games with Syracuse, he hit .271 with 15 home runs and 59 RBI.

Bell&#x27;s first season as a regular was in , and he finished his first full season batting .292 with 26 home runs and 87 RBI in 159 games. That season, he first teamed with fellow outfielders Lloyd Moseby and Jesse Barfield. That outfield, along with solid starting pitching, led the Blue Jays to their first-ever American League East division title in . Bell caught a fly ball, off the bat of Ron Hassey, for the final out in the 5–1 victory over the New York Yankees on October 5, clinching the division title for the Blue Jays. Despite Bell&#x27;s .321 average in the ALCS, they lost the series to the Kansas City Royals. His best season came in , although the Blue Jays fell two games short of the Detroit Tigers in the division race. Bell finished with a .308 batting average, .352 on-base percentage, .608 slugging percentage, 111 runs, 47 home runs, a league-leading 134 RBI, and a major-league leading 369 total bases in 156 games. He was awarded the American League MVP award that year.

On April 4, , Bell became the first player in Major League history to hit three home runs on an opening day (all of them coming off of Bret Saberhagen); however, his play throughout the year declined as he conflicted with Blue Jays manager Jimy Williams, who wanted Bell to become the Jays&#x27; full-time designated hitter. He finished the season batting .269 with 24 home runs and 97 RBI in 156 games. 

Bell had a bounce-back year in , posting a .297 average, 18 home runs and 104 RBI in 153 games, helping the Blue Jays win their second division title. On May 28, 1989, Bell hit a walk-off home run in a 7–5 victory over the Chicago White Sox in the final Major League game played at Exhibition Stadium. Bell also homered in the first game at the Blue Jays&#x27; new park, SkyDome (now the Rogers Centre), on June 5, eight days later. However, in the ALCS, he only hit .200 with one home run, as the Blue Jays lost the series to the Oakland Athletics. Bell became a free agent after the season. 

On December 6, 1990, Bell signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Cubs worth a guaranteed $13 million. The deal included an option for a fourth year. He batted .285 with 25 home runs and 86 RBI in 149 games, earning his third and final selection to the All-Star Game. After one year with the Cubs, he was traded across town to the Chicago White Sox for Sammy Sosa and Ken Patterson on March 30, 1992. In his first season with the White Sox, Bell hit .255 while recording 25 home runs and 112 RBI in 155 games. In , his play declined, primarily due to a persistent knee injury, and he finished with a .217 average, 13 home runs and 64 RBI in 102 games. In a game against the Boston Red Sox, Aaron Sele threw at Bell&#x27;s head twice, which caused Bell to charge at Sele. Bell went to punch him but Sele dodged it before Bell got clotheslined by Mo Vaughn and sparking a benches-clearing brawl. Bell was suspended for two games for his actions. He was benched in the ALCS against his former team, the Blue Jays, and was released at the end of the season, after which he announced his retirement. 

Bell was a powerful free-swinger, usually posting a good slugging percentage and relatively low strikeout rate, but a poor on-base percentage. He was known as a mediocre defensive player and played mainly as a designated hitter during the last two years of his career, despite his strong preference for playing in the field. Despite his success on the field, Bell had a love-hate relationship with the fans and media in Toronto, particularly in his later years as his declining defensive game came to overshadow his offensive talents. After the fans booed him for committing an error, he told the media that the fans could &quot;kiss my purple butt.&quot; The next day a sign appeared in left field &quot;George, we are behind you all the way.&quot; Bell&#x27;s difficult relationship with the Toronto sports media was exacerbated by his reluctance to do interviews during his early years with the Blue Jays (which was due to his then-weak knowledge with the English language). Towards the end of his time in Toronto, however, Bell warmed to the media, who in turn began to soften their often harsh criticisms of his play and attitude.

Bell is enshrined in the upper deck of the Rogers Centre&#x27;s Level of Excellence, devoted to players and personnel who have made a significant impact as members of the Toronto Blue Jays. He shares the honor with Tony Fernández, Joe Carter, Cito Gaston, Pat Gillick, Dave Stieb, Tom Cheek, Carlos Delgado, Paul Beeston, Roy Halladay and José Bautista.
In 2004, Bell was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

==Career statistics==
In 1,587 games over 12 seasons, Bell posted a .278 batting average (1,702-for-6,123) with 814 runs, 308 doubles, 34 triples, 265 home runs, 1,002 RBI, 331 base on balls, .316 on-base percentage and .469 slugging percentage. He recorded a .964 fielding percentage. In the 1985 and 1989 ALCS, he hit .271 (13-for-48) with six runs, a home run and 3 RBI.

==Personal life==
Bell is the older brother of late major leaguer Juan Bell.

<text>Donna Edna Shalala ( ; born February 14, 1941) is an American politician and academic who served in the Carter and Clinton administrations, as well as in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2019 to 2021. Shalala is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which she was awarded in 2008, and, on August 16, 2023, assumed the role of Interim President of The New School, a university in New York City.

Shalala earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Western College for Women in 1962 and served in the Peace Corps. In 1970, she earned a PhD from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. Shalala later worked as a professor at Baruch College and at Teachers College, Columbia University and was appointed as assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development by President Jimmy Carter. Shalala became the president of Hunter College in 1980, serving until 1988 when she became chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

From 1993 to 2001, Shalala served as the 18th United States Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton. Shalala served as HHS secretary for all eight years of the Clinton administration, becoming the nation&#x27;s longest-serving HHS secretary. She is the first Lebanese-American to serve in a Cabinet position. Shalala served as president of the University of Miami from 2001 through 2015, and also taught at the university during that period. She was president of the Clinton Foundation from 2015 to 2017.

A member of the Democratic Party, Shalala was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from in 2018. She served one term in the House before being defeated in the 2020 election by María Elvira Salazar in an upset.

== Early life and education ==
Shalala was born in Cleveland, Ohio, of Maronite Catholic Lebanese descent. Her father sold real estate; and her mother, one of the first Lebanese-Americans to graduate from Ohio State University, was a teacher who worked two jobs and attended law school at night. She has a twin sister, Diane Fritel.

Shalala attended West Technical High School where she was the editor of the school newspaper. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1962 from Western College for Women. From 1962 to 1964, she was among the first volunteers to serve in the Peace Corps. Her placement took her to a rural farming village in southern Iran where she worked with other volunteers to construct an agricultural college. In 1970, she earned a Ph.D. from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York.

==Career==
Shalala began her teaching career as a political science professor at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York, where she also was a member of the American Federation of Teachers union.

===Teachers College, Columbia University===
In 1972, Shalala became a professor of politics and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, a post she held until 1979. Shalala became the only woman on the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a group tasked with saving the city during the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. Concurrently, from 1977 to 1980, she served as the assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Carter administration.

===Hunter College===
Shalala&#x27;s first experience with academic administration came on October 8, 1980, when she became the tenth president of Hunter College, serving in this capacity until 1988.

===University of Wisconsin-Madison===
Shalala served as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Madison (1988–1993). At the time of her chancellorship, the university included 42,000 students, employed 16,500 people, and had an annual budget of $1 billion. She was the first woman to lead a Big Ten Conference school and only the second woman in the country to head a major research university.

Under Shalala&#x27;s chancellorship and with her support, the university adopted a broad speech code subjecting students to disciplinary action for communications that were perceived as hate speech. That speech code was later found unconstitutional by a federal judge. Also while chancellor, Shalala supported passage of a revised faculty speech code broadly restricting &quot;harmful&quot; speech in both &quot;noninstructional&quot; and &quot;instructional&quot; settings. The faculty speech code was abolished ten years later, after a number of professors were investigated for alleged or suspected violations.

===U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (1993–2001)===

Following a year serving as chair of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund (1992–1993), Shalala was nominated in 1992 by then President-elect Bill Clinton for the position of United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; labeled her &quot;one of the most controversial Clinton Cabinet nominees&quot;. Her nomination went before the Senate Finance Committee in January 1993, and the Senate voted to confirm her on January 22, 1993. At the start of Shalala&#x27;s tenure, the Department of Health and Human Services employed 125,000 people and had a budget of $539 billion.

Shalala served as HHS secretary for eight years during the Clinton administration, becoming the nation&#x27;s longest-serving HHS secretary. In 1996, Shalala was the designated survivor during Clinton&#x27;s State of the Union address. She is the first Lebanese-American to serve in a cabinet position.

===Corporate boards (2001–2012)===
In 2001, Shalala joined the boards of UnitedHealth and Lennar, where over the following decade she earned millions of dollars. Shalala was paid almost a half-million dollars in 2010 to serve on the boards of three companies, two of which were run by University of Miami trustees.

When she left Lennar in 2012, the company reported it was to avoid a &quot;conflict of interest&quot;. Lennar&#x27;s CEO, Stuart Miller, had joined the University of Miami Board of Trustees in 2002. Shalala rejoined Lennar in 2017 after she was no longer President of the University. She has also been member of the advisory board of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.

===University of Miami presidency (2001–2015)===

In 2001, Shalala became president of the University of Miami. She created a University of Miami fundraising campaign, Momentum, designed to raise the university&#x27;s endowment from approximately $750 million to $1 billion; the goal was later increased to $1.25 billion by the end of 2007.

In 2013, the University of Miami sold 88 acres of undeveloped Pine Rocklands, one of the last remnants of the imperiled habitat in Miami-Dade County outside of Everglades National Park, to Ram Realty Services, for $22 million. &quot;Miami New Times&quot; described this amount as &quot;a complete steal for the developer in light of the relative worth of nearby property.&quot; Also in 2013, Ram Realty and Lennar Corp worked on at least one project together in North Carolina. When Shalala ran for the US Congress in 2018, her candidacy was opposed by local environmentalists for her part in the sale of the University of Miami pine rocklands site.

Shalala faced criticism for her response to a nationally publicized custodial workers&#x27; strike at the University of Miami, which lasted from February 28, 2006, until May 1, 2006. Critics called the University of Miami&#x27;s custodial workers among the lowest paid university-based custodians in the nation and alleged they were not earning a living wage. The strike prompted Shalala to raise wages. Shalala was also criticized for living in luxury while the custodians did not have health insurance. Shalala criticized union organizer&#x27;s tactics, including a sit-in that she said prevented students from attending classes.

On September 8, 2014, Shalala announced that she would be stepping down at the end of the 2014–2015 academic year.

===Clinton Foundation (2015–2017)===

In 2015, Shalala took a leave of absence from her tenured professorship at the University of Miami to volunteer for the Clinton Foundation. She followed her tenure as president of the University of Miami by being named chief executive officer of the Foundation, serving in that capacity from 2015 to 2017.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Chelsea Clinton helped persuade Shalala to leave the University of Miami, move to New York and head the foundation. Shalala maintained a home in Miami and taught part-time at the University of Miami while heading the foundation in New York.

Shalala led the Clinton Foundation during the 2016 presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton was a leading candidate and the propriety of the foundation&#x27;s activity came under scrutiny. In a September 14, 2016, interview on MSNBC, Shalala admitted that there was &quot;no question&quot; that donors to the Clinton Foundation had been given &quot;courtesy appointments&quot; in the State Department while Hillary Clinton ran that department. Shalala oversaw the termination of the Clinton Global Initiative during her tenure as CEO, as well as other reductions in operations intended to avoid conflicts of interest if Clinton won the election. She resisted calls by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; to shut down the foundation entirely, arguing that &quot;there are human beings around the world who would be affected by these decisions.&quot; Shalala left the Clinton Foundation in April 2017 and returned to her full-time teaching position at the University of Miami, replacing her former HHS deputy Kevin Thurm.

Following a September 2015 Clinton Global Initiative event held at the Sheraton New York Hotel, Shalala fell ill. It was subsequently reported in a Clinton Foundation statement that she had suffered a stroke. In early 2018, she said she had recovered.

===U.S. House of Representatives (2019–2021)===
====2018====

In March 2018, Shalala declared her candidacy in the Democratic primary for Florida&#x27;s 27th congressional district. The district included just over half of Miami as well as some of its eastern suburbs. The district voted for Clinton by a comfortable margin in the 2016 presidential election, but its House seat was held by 30-year incumbent Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who had announced that she would retire at the conclusion of her term.

In an interview with WFOR-TV, Shalala stated that she supported universal healthcare coverage, but opposed a Medicare For All single-payer healthcare system because she believed that individuals who liked their current employment-based healthcare plans should be able to keep them. On August 28, 2018, Shalala won the Democratic five-candidate primary over state Representative David Richardson. The outcome of the race was substantially closer than polling predicted, which had her leading consistently by double digits. She won with 31.9 percent of the vote, vs. 27.5% for Richardson.

Shalala ran against Republican candidate María Elvira Salazar, an anchorwoman for Miami Telemundo outlet WSCV, in the general election. Shalala&#x27;s campaign emphasized her experience and sought to tie Salazar to President Donald Trump, who was unpopular in the district. The race proved closer than expected, in part because Shalala does not speak Spanish; the 27th district is over 63 percent Latino. As late as a month before the election, polls showed Shalala either behind or practically tied with Salazar. However, Shalala won the election at the age of 77, making her the third-oldest freshman Representative in history after William Lewis of Kentucky who was elected at the age of 79 in 1948 and James B. Bowler of Illinois who was elected at the age of 78 in 1953.

Shalala was sworn in as a member of the 116th United States Congress on January 3, 2019.

====2020====

In the 2020 general election, Shalala ran against Republican Salazar again. On November 3, 2020, Shalala was defeated by Salazar. Salazar received 51.4% (176,141 votes) of the vote to Shalala&#x27;s 48.6% (166,758 votes).

====Tenure====
On December 18, 2019, Shalala voted to impeach President Donald Trump.

On April 17, 2020, Shalala was appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve on the COVID-19 Congressional Oversight Commission to oversee the implementation of the &quot;CARES Act&quot;. The appointment was met with criticism; the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that Shalala had violated the STOCK Act by failing to disclose more than 500 stock trades, but Shalala remained on the commission and paid a $1,200 fine to the United States House Committee on Ethics.

On September 28, 2020, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reported that Shalala failed to publicly report two additional stock trades in violation of the STOCK Act disclosure rules.

Shalala was named a vice-chair of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

====Committee assignments====
*Committee on Education and Labor
**Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
**United States House Education Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions
*Committee on Rules

====Caucus memberships====
*Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus
*Congressional Solar Caucus

=== Interim Presidency at the New School ===
Following the departure of Dwight A. McBride, Shalala was appointed as interim president of the New School, becoming the first female president of the university. Following student demands, Shalala&#x27;s administration listed the property assigned to the president for $20 million. On October 9, 2023, Shalala came under harsh criticism from pro-Palestinian faculty and student groups after emailing a statement about the October 7 attacks that did not acknowledge lives lost in Gaza. The following morning, she issued another statement that included Palestinian recognition as well as an apology for her previous exclusion. The New School, like other universities, continue to be protested for connections to the Israeli occupation, including its 14-year association with the Center for Jazz Studies at the Israel Conservatory of Music.

=== Board memberships ===
Shalala served on the board of directors of the United States Soccer Federation. Shalala served as a member of the board of directors of Lennar. She served on the board of directors of Gannett Company from 2001 to 2011, retiring because of age limits.

In January 2012, the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported on a potential conflict of interest involving Shalala&#x27;s service on the boards of property development companies.

=== Civic activities ===

In 1985, Shalala became a founding member of EMILY&#x27;s List, a political action committee that seeks to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office. Shalala served from 2001 to 2007 on the board of the Albert Shanker Institute, a small, three-member staff organization named for the former head of the American Federation of Teachers. She is an honorary board member of the American Iranian Council, an organization that seeks to improve Iran–United States relations.

Shalala serves as a co-leader of the Nutrition and Physical Activity Initiative at the Bipartisan Policy Center. She serves as a distinguished senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program and the Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform at the Brookings Institution. She is also a member of Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington D.C.–based think tank.

Shalala also served as a panelist on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a working group of former high-ranking government officials and academic experts that put together a set of recommendations regarding the United States&#x27; defense capabilities against biological threats.

===Honors and awards===
At the University of Miami, Shalala was inducted the Iron Arrow Honor Society, the highest honor bestowed by the University of Miami. In 2002, she was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa.

On June 19, 2008, Shalala was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush. In 2010, she received the Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York in 2011. In 2014, she was recognized by the Harry S Truman Library and Museum with the Harry S Truman Legacy of Leadership Award. In 2019, Shalala was announced as one of the members of the inaugural class of the Government Hall of Fame.

Shalala has been awarded more than 50 honorary degrees.

<text>David Allen Ogden Stiers ( ; October 31, 1942 – March 3, 2018) was an American actor and conductor. He appeared in numerous productions on Broadway, and originated the role of Feldman in &quot;The Magic Show&quot;, in 1974.

In 1977, Stiers was cast as Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, MD, on the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a role he portrayed until the series&#x27; conclusion in 1983, and which earned him two Emmy Award nominations. He appeared prominently in the 1980s in the role of District Attorney Michael Reston in several &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television films, and voiced a number of Disney characters, including Cogsworth in 1991&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, and Dr. Jumba Jookiba in the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise. He also voiced Kamaji in the English-language version of &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (2001). He appeared in television again on the supernatural drama series &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; as Reverend Gene Purdy, a role he portrayed from 2002 to 2007.

He joined the cast of &quot;&quot; in its third season as Oberoth, leader of the human-form replicators.

Stiers continued to contribute voice work for films and television productions in his later years, narrating M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;Lady in the Water&quot; (2006) and having a recurring role on the animated series &quot;Regular Show&quot;. Stiers spent his later years as a conductor of the Newport Symphony Orchestra.

== Early life ==
David Allen Ogden Stiers was born at St. Francis Hospital in Peoria, Illinois, on October 31, 1942, the son of Margaret Elizabeth (née Ogden) and Kenneth Truman Stiers, and grew up in Peoria Heights, Chillicothe, and Urbana, Illinois. His family moved to Eugene, Oregon, where he graduated from North Eugene High School, and briefly attended the University of Oregon. Stiers subsequently moved to San Francisco, where he performed with the California Shakespeare Theater, San Francisco Actors Workshop, and the improvisation group The Committee, whose members included Rob Reiner, Howard Hesseman, and Peter Bonerz. In California, he worked for the Santa Clara Shakespeare Festival for seven years.
It was while he was performing in California that Stiers was spotted by John Houseman. Houseman invited Stiers to relocate to New York City to study at the Juilliard School (Drama Division &quot;Group 1&quot;: 1968–1972), from which he graduated in 1972. 
Following graduation, Stiers was one the founding members of the City Center Acting Company. Stiers appeared in many Acting Company productions including &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early acting credits ===
Stiers first appeared in the Broadway production &quot;The Magic Show&quot; in 1974 in the role of Feldman. Subsequent early credits included roles on the television series &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, and &quot;Rhoda&quot;. Stiers also appeared in the pilot of &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; as the team&#x27;s chief backup. He also appeared as a teacher in the 1977 television film &quot;A Circle of Children&quot;, about a school for special-needs children.

=== &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1977–1983) ===

In 1977, Stiers joined the cast of the CBS sitcom &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. As Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, MD, Stiers filled the void created by the departure of actor Larry Linville&#x27;s Frank Burns character. In contrast to the buffoonish Burns, Winchester was articulate and socially sophisticated, and a highly talented surgeon who presented a very different type of foil to Alan Alda&#x27;s Hawkeye Pierce and Mike Farrell&#x27;s B.J. Hunnicutt. Burns usually served as the butt of practical jokes instigated by Pierce or Hunnicutt, was frequently inundated by insults for which he had no comebacks, and was often harshly criticized for his surgical skills. Winchester, however, presented a challenge to his colleagues&#x27; displays of irreverence, since his surgical skills could match or even outshine their own, and when it came to pranks and insults, he frequently outmaneuvered his opponent; his patrician manner and aversion to puerile behavior served as the target for his fellow surgeons&#x27; barbs and jokes. At times, however, Winchester could align himself with Pierce and Hunnicutt, and the occasional tantrum aside, held considerable admiration for his commanding officer, Harry Morgan&#x27;s Colonel Sherman T. Potter. For his portrayal of the pompous but emotionally complex Boston aristocrat, Stiers received two Emmy Award nominations.

=== Other television work ===
After &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; completed its run in 1983, Stiers made guest appearances on the television shows &quot;North and South&quot;; &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Matlock&quot;; &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;; &quot;Wings&quot;; &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;, along with a regular role in the first season of &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot; as Mr. Bauer. In 1984, he portrayed United States Olympic Committee founder William Milligan Sloane in the NBC miniseries &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot; for which he received another Emmy nomination. Beginning in 1985, Stiers made his first of eight appearances in &quot;Perry Mason&quot; television film as District Attorney Michael Reston. He appeared in two unsuccessful television projects, &quot;Love &amp; Money&quot; and &quot;Justice League of America&quot; (as Martian Manhunter). He also played Uncle Teddy Quinn (brother of Dr. Mike&#x27;s father), a world renowned concert pianist, in &quot;Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman&quot;. In 2002, Stiers started a recurring role as the Reverend Purdy on the successful USA Network series &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; with Anthony Michael Hall. In 2006, he was cast as the recurring character Oberoth in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.

=== Voice acting ===
Stiers provided voice work for dozens of film and television projects. His first work was on one of George Lucas&#x27;s earliest films, the critically acclaimed &quot;THX 1138&quot;, in which he was incorrectly billed as &quot;David Ogden Steers&quot;. Stiers voiced PBS documentary films such as Ric Burns&#x27;s project &quot;New York: A Documentary Film&quot;, 2010 Peabody Award winner &quot;The Lord is Not on Trial Here Today&quot;, and several episodes of the documentary television series &quot;American Experience&quot;, including Ansel Adams (2002), also directed by Ric Burns. He voiced Mr. Piccolo in the animated English-dubbed version of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s 1992 film &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, as well as Kamaji in the English dub of the studio&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. He collaborated with Disney on eight animated features, including 1991&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (as Cogsworth, also providing the opening narration), 1995&#x27;s &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (as Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins), 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; (as the Archdeacon), 2001&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (as Mr. Harcourt), and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (as Jumba Jookiba). He reprised a number of his Disney roles for various sequels, most notably with Jumba in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;&#x27;s three sequel films (2003&#x27;s &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot;, 2005&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch&quot;, and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Leroy &amp; Stitch&quot;) and &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;.

He lent his voice to the direct-to-video &quot;&quot; (2003) as the Penguin. Stiers did voice work for Solovar in a two-part episode, &quot;The Brave and The Bold&quot; of &quot;Justice League&quot; and voiced Solovar again in a &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;. He voiced Mr. Jolly from &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;. He voiced the king and prime minister in the 2004 short film &quot;The Cat That Looked at a King&quot;. In &quot;Hoodwinked&quot; (2005), Stiers voiced the role of Nicky Flippers, the frog detective who is dispatched to Granny&#x27;s house. He voiced Pops&#x27;s father, Mr. Maellard, in the animated TV series &quot;Regular Show&quot;, which debuted in 2010. Stiers had voices in several video games, including &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep&quot;, as Jeff Zandi in &quot;&quot;, and as Esher in &quot;Myst V: End of Ages&quot;.

Stiers was the reader for numerous audiobook versions of novels, including Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;A Man in Full&quot; (1998), and Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;The First Man in Rome&quot;.

=== Music ===
Though he had no formal musical training, Stiers was the associate conductor of the Newport (Oregon) Symphony Orchestra and the Ernest Bloch Music Festival. He also played a major role in establishing the Newport Symphony. He guest-conducted over 70 orchestras around the world, including the Oregon Mozart Players, the Vancouver Symphony, the Virginia Symphony, the Oregon Chamber Players, and the Yaquina (Oregon) Chamber Orchestra, as well as orchestras in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Chicago, Salt Lake City, and Toronto.

Stiers traced his love of music back to a performance by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra on the basketball court at the University of Oregon in the 1950s. During his days at Juilliard, he would skip his acting classes to sit in on master classes led by such notables as John Williams, Pierre Boulez, and Sir Georg Solti.

Stiers also performed as Reverend Brock in the 2000 New York City Center&#x27;s Encores! series presentation of Tenderloin (musical).

== Personal life ==
Stiers came out as gay in 2009, telling Oklahoma City blog &quot;Gossip Boy&quot; that he feared coming out would hurt his career and that &quot;a lot of my income has been derived from voicing Disney and family programming. What they might allow in a more known actor, they prefer not having to deal with in minor players.&quot; He said his main reason for coming out was for the sake of a future potential partner: &quot;I could claim noble reasons as coming out in order to move gay rights forward, but I must admit it is for far more selfish reasons. Now is the time I wish to find someone, and I do not desire to force any potential partner to live a life of extreme discretion with me.&quot;

== Death ==
Stiers died at his home in Newport, Oregon, on March 3, 2018, at the age of 75, from complications related to bladder cancer. His will made provisions for bequests to several arts organizations in his area, including the Newport Symphony, Newport Public Library, and the Oregon Coast Council for the Arts, among others.

<text>Daveigh Elizabeth Chase ( ; née Chase-Schwallier; born July 24, 1990) is an American actress. She began her career appearing in minor television roles before being cast as Samantha Darko in Richard Kelly&#x27;s cult film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. She would subsequently provide the voices of Chihiro Ogino in the English dub of the Studio Ghibli film &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, and Lilo Pelekai in the Disney animated feature film &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; and its subsequent franchise, before appearing as Samara Morgan, the child antagonist in the 2002 horror film &quot;The Ring&quot;.

Between 2006 and 2011, she played a supporting part in the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot;, portraying Rhonda Volmer, a sociopathic teenager raised in a polygamist family. In 2009, she reprised her role as Samantha Darko in &quot;S. Darko&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. She also appeared in the 2016 horror film &quot;Jack Goes Home&quot;.

==Early life==
Chase was born on July 24, 1990, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her name was changed to Daveigh Elizabeth Chase after her parents, Cathy Chase and John Schwallier, divorced. Chase was raised in Albany, Oregon.

==Career==
Chase&#x27;s big break came in 1998 when she won the lead role as the voice of a Hawaiian girl, Lilo Pelekai, in the Disney animated feature, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002). The film relates how Lilo befriends a strange and destructive blue alien thinly disguised as a dog, whom she calls &quot;Stitch&quot;, and how she tries to teach him how to behave using Elvis Presley music as exemplars. For her performance, Chase would go on to win an Annie Award in 2003 and star in the follow-up TV series, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;. Chase also voiced the role of the lead character, Chihiro Ogino, a 10 year-old Japanese girl, in the American dub of the anime Japanese feature, &quot;Spirited Away&quot;.

In 2002, Chase starred in the role of Samara Morgan in the feature film, &quot;The Ring&quot;. Chase was awarded the 2003 Best Villain award at the MTV Movie Awards for her performance, beating out Mike Myers, Colin Farrell, Willem Dafoe and Daniel Day-Lewis. In the sequel to &quot;The Ring&quot;, &quot;The Ring Two&quot; (2005), Chase was credited for her role as Samara Morgan because of the use of archive footage from the first &quot;Ring&quot;, but Kelly Stables performed all of the new archive footage.

Chase&#x27;s main other major film and TV credits between 2000 and 2005 were the film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), as Donnie&#x27;s younger sister, Samantha, and &quot;Oliver Beene&quot; (2003–2004), as Oliver&#x27;s quirky girlfriend Joyce. Other credits include &quot;The Rats&quot; (2002), &quot;Carolina&quot; (2003), &quot;R.L. Stine&#x27;s Haunted Lighthouse&quot; (2003) in which she played a flying ghost called Annabel, and &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s 5th&quot; (2003). She also made guest appearances in &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Family Law&quot;, and &quot;The Practice&quot;.

In 2006, Chase was given the role of Rhonda Volmer in the HBO drama series &quot;Big Love&quot; which centers on a polygamist family and its patriarch, Bill Henrickson, played by Bill Paxton. The show focuses upon Henrickson&#x27;s relationship with his three wives. Chase&#x27;s character is the child bride of a prophet, Roman Grant, played by Harry Dean Stanton.

&quot;Leroy &amp; Stitch&quot;, the finale to &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, was released in 2006, making it the last time Chase voiced Lilo. Chase then appeared in the second season of &quot;Big Love&quot;, which aired in 2007. She also voiced Betsy in the PBS show &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Kindergarten Adventures&quot; the same year. She reprised her role as Donnie Darko&#x27;s younger sister, Samantha, in the film &quot;S. Darko&quot;. The story picks up seven years after the first film when Samantha Darko and her best friend Corey are now 18 years old and on a road trip to Los Angeles when they are afflicted by bizarre visions.

In 2015, she starred in the thriller film &quot;Killer Crush&quot; and in the independent horror film &quot;Wild in Blue&quot; with Karen Black. In 2016, she starred in the thriller film &quot;American Romance&quot; with Nolan Gerard Funk, and appeared in the thriller film &quot;Jack Goes Home&quot; with Rory Culkin, Britt Robertson, Lin Shaye and Nikki Reed.

<doc id="318121" wikidata="Q38849" url="?curid=318121" title="Shintaro Ishihara">
<text>was a Japanese politician and writer, who served as the Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. Being the former leader of the right Sunrise Party, later merged with Toru Hashimoto&#x27;s Japan Restoration Party out of which he split his faction into the Party for Japanese Kokoro, he was one of the most prominent ultranationalists in modern Japanese politics. Ishihara was infamous for his misogynistic comments, his xenophobic views and his racist remarks against Chinese and Koreans in Japan, including his use of the antiquated pejorative term &quot;sangokujin&quot;. He was also a denier of the Nanjing Massacre.

A critic of relations between Japan and the United States, his artistic accomplishments included his authorship of a prize-winning novel, his authorship of best-sellers, and his work in theater, film, and journalism. His 1989 book, &quot;The Japan That Can Say No&quot;, co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita (published in English in 1991), called on the authors&#x27; countrymen to stand up to America.

After an early career as a writer and a film director, Ishihara served as in the House of Councillors from 1968 to 1972, then he served as in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1995, just four years before he served as Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. He resigned from the governorship to briefly co-lead the Sunrise Party, before he joined the Japan Restoration Party upon his return to the House of Representatives in the 2012 general election. He unsuccessfully sought re-election in the general election of November 2014, and officially left politics the following month.

In October 2021, Ishihara was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer while his wife, Noriko had ruptured aortic aneurysm, and given only three months to live amid a routine physical exam. Ishihara died from its complications on 1 February 2022, at the age of 89.

== Early life and artistic career ==

Shintaro Ishihara was born on 30 September 1932 in Suma-ku, Kobe. His father, Kiyoshi Ishihara (1899–1951), an employee, later a general manager, of a shipping company, and his mother, Mitsuko Ishihara (1909–1992), a daughter of Sannosuke Kato from Hiroshima. He grew up in Zushi, Kanagawa, parts of Greater Tokyo Area. In 1952, Ishihara entered Hitotsubashi University, and he graduated in 1956. Just two months before graduation, Ishihara won the Akutagawa Prize (Japan&#x27;s most prestigious literary prize) for the novel &quot;Season of the Sun&quot;. His brother Yujiro played a supporting role in the movie adaptation of the novel (for which Shintaro wrote the screenplay). Ishihara had dabbled in directing a couple of films starring his brother. Regarding these early years as a filmmaker, he said to a &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot; interviewer in 1990 that &quot;If I had remained a movie director, I can assure you that I would have at least become a better one than Akira Kurosawa&quot;.

In the early 1960s, he concentrated on writing, including plays, novels, and a musical version of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. One of his later novels, &quot;Lost Country&quot; (1982), speculated about Japan under the control of the Soviet Union. He also ran a theatre company, and found time to visit the North Pole, race his yacht &quot;The Contessa&quot; and cross South America on a motorcycle. He wrote a memoir of his journey, &quot;Nanbei Odan Ichiman Kiro&quot;.

From 1966 to 1967, he covered the Vietnam War at the request of &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot;, and the experience influenced his decision to enter politics. He also was mentored by the influential author and political &quot;fixer&quot; Tsûsai Sugawara.

== Political career ==
In 1968, Ishihara ran as a candidate on the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) national slate for the House of Councillors. He placed first on the LDP list with an unprecedented 3 million votes. After four years in the upper house, Ishihara ran for the House of Representatives representing the second district of Tokyo, and again won election.

In 1973, he joined with thirty other LDP lawmakers in the anti-communist &quot;Seirankai&quot; or &quot;Blue Storm Group&quot;; the group gained notoriety for sealing a pledge of unity in their own blood.

Ishihara ran for Governor of Tokyo in 1975 but lost to the popular Socialist incumbent Ryokichi Minobe. Minobe was 71 at the time, and Ishihara criticized him as being &quot;too old&quot;.

Ishihara returned to the House of Representatives afterward, and worked his way up the party&#x27;s internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under Takeo Fukuda (1976) and Minister of Transport under Noboru Takeshita (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but was unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder. In 1983, his campaign manager put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara&#x27;s political opponent was an defector from North Korea. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had a right to know.

In 1989, shortly after losing a highly contested race for the party presidency, Ishihara came to the attention of the West through his book &quot;The Japan That Can Say No&quot;, co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita. The book called on his fellow countrymen to stand up to America.

=== Governor of Tokyo ===
In the 1999 Tokyo gubernatorial election, he ran on an independent platform and was elected as Governor of Tokyo. Among Ishihara&#x27;s moves as governor, he:
* Cut metropolitan spending projects, including plans for a new Toei Subway line, and proposed the sale or leasing out of many metropolitan facilities.
* Imposed a new tax on banks&#x27; gross profits (rather than net profits).
* Imposed a new hotel tax based on occupancy.
* Imposed restrictions on the operation of diesel-powered vehicles, following a highly publicized event where he held up a bottle of diesel soot before cameras and reporters.
* Imposed cap and trade energy tax.
* Proposed opening casinos in the Odaiba district.
* Declared in 2005 that Tokyo would bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which discouraged a bid by Fukuoka. Tokyo&#x27;s bid lost to that of Rio de Janeiro.
* Set up the ShinGinko Tokyo bank to lend to SMEs (small medium enterprises) in Tokyo. The project came under criticism- according to The Times, the bank had lost approximately 1 billion dollars worth of taxpayers&#x27; money through inadequate customer risk assessments.
* Served as Chairman of Tokyo&#x27;s successful bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.
* Generated controversy from PETA for the culling of the 37,000 crows that populated Tokyo.

He won re-election in 2003 with 70.2% of the vote, and re-election in 2007 with 50.52% of the vote. In the 2011 gubernatorial election, his share of the vote dipped to 43.4% against challenges by comedian Hideo Higashikokubaru and entrepreneur Miki Watanabe.

On 25 October 2012, Ishihara announced he would resign as Governor of Tokyo to form a new political party in preparation for upcoming national elections. Following his announcement, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly approved his resignation on 31 October 2012, officially ending his tenure as Governor of Tokyo for 4,941 days, the second-longest term after Shunichi Suzuki.

===Sunrise Party===
Ishihara&#x27;s new national party was expected to be formed with members of the right-wing Sunrise Party of Japan, which he had helped to set up in 2010. When announced by co-leaders Ishihara and SPJ chief Takeo Hiranuma on 13 November 2012, Sunrise Party incorporated all five members of SPJ. SP would look to form a coalition with other small parties including Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto&#x27;s Japan Restoration Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai).

In November 2012, Ishihara and his co-leader Hiranuma said that the Sunrise Party would pursue &quot;establishment of an independent Constitution, beefing up of Japan&#x27;s defense capabilities, and fundamental reform of fiscal management and tax systems to make them more transparent&quot;. The future of nuclear power and the upcoming consumption tax hike were issues it would have to address with potential coalition partners.

===Sunrise Party merger with the Japan Restoration Party===
Only four days after the Sunrise Party was launched, on 17 November 2012, Ishihara and Tōru Hashimoto, leader of the Japan Restoration Party (JRP), decided to merge their parties, with Ishihara becoming the head of the JRP. Your Party would not join the party, nor would Genzei Nippon, as the latter party&#x27;s anti-consumption tax increase policy did not match the JRP&#x27;s pro-consumption tax policy.

Reporting on a poll in early December 2012, &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; characterized the merger with Japan Restoration Party as the latter having &quot;swallowed up&quot; Sunrise. The poll, in advance of the 16 December Lower House elections, also said the association with SP could hurt JRP&#x27;s chances of forming a ruling coalition even though JRP was showing strength relative to the ruling DPJ.

=== Party for Future Generations ===
In December 2014 general elections, he was a candidate for the Party for Future Generations, an extreme right-wing party, but he was defeated. Following this, he retired from politics.

== Political views ==

Ishihara is generally described as having been one of Japan&#x27;s most prominent extreme right-wing politicians. He was called &quot;Japan&#x27;s [Jean-Marie] Le Pen&quot; on a program broadcast on Australia&#x27;s ABC. He was affiliated with the openly ultranationalist organization Nippon Kaigi.

=== Foreign relations ===
Ishihara was a long-term friend of the prominent Aquino family in the Philippines. He is credited with being the first person to inform future President Corazon Aquino about the assassination of her husband Ninoy Aquino, a former senator and exiled critic of Ferdinand Marcos, on 21 August 1983.

Ishihara was often critical of Japan&#x27;s foreign policy as being non-assertive. Regarding Japan&#x27;s relationship with the U.S., he stated that &quot;The country I dislike most in terms of U.S.–Japan ties is Japan, because it&#x27;s a country that can&#x27;t assert itself.&quot; As part of the criticism, Ishihara published a book co-authored with the then Prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, titled &quot;&quot;No&quot; to ieru Ajia – tai Oubei e no hōsaku&quot; in 1994.

Ishihara was also long critical of the communist government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He invited the Dalai Lama and the President of Taiwan Lee Teng-hui to Tokyo.

Ishihara was deeply interested in the North Korean abduction issue, and called for economic sanctions against North Korea. Following Ishihara&#x27;s campaign to bid Tokyo for the 2016 Summer Olympics, he eased his criticism of the PRC government. He accepted an invitation to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was selected as a torch-bearer for the Japan leg of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay.

=== Views on foreigners in Japan ===
On 9 April 2000, in a speech before a Self-Defense Forces group, Ishihara said crimes were repeatedly committed by illegally entered people, using the pejorative term &quot;sangokujin&quot;, and foreigners. He also speculated that in the event a natural disaster struck the Tokyo area, they would be likely to cause civil disorder. His comment invoked calls for his resignation, demands for an apology and fears among residents of Korean descent in Japan, as well as being criticised by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

Regarding this statement, Ishihara later said:

On 20 February 2006, Ishihara also said: &quot;Roppongi is now virtually a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don&#x27;t mean African-Americans—who don&#x27;t speak English are there doing who knows what. This is leading to new forms of crime such as car theft. We should be letting in people who are intelligent.&quot;

On 17 April 2010, Ishihara said &quot;many veteran lawmakers in the ruling-coalition parties are naturalized or the offspring of people naturalized in Japan&quot;.

=== Other controversial statements ===
In 1990, Ishihara said in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview that the Rape of Nanjing was a fiction, claiming, &quot;People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese. It has tarnished the image of Japan, but it is a lie.&quot; He continued to defend this statement in the uproar that ensued. He also backed the film &quot;The Truth about Nanjing&quot;, a Japanese film that denies the atrocity, framing it as Chinese communist propaganda.

In 2000, Ishihara, one of the eight judges for a literary prize, commented that homosexuality is abnormal, which caused an outrage in the gay community in Japan.

In a 2001 interview with women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Shukan Josei&quot;, Ishihara said that he believed &quot;old women who live after they have lost their reproductive function are useless and are committing a sin,&quot; adding that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t say this as a politician.&quot; He was criticized in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly for these comments, but responded that the criticism was driven by &quot;tyrant… old women.&quot;

During an inauguration of a university building in 2004, Ishihara stated that French is unqualified as an international language because it is &quot;a language in which nobody can count&quot;, referring to the counting system in French, which is based on units of twenty for numbers from 70 to 99 rather than ten (as is the case in Japanese and English). The statement led to a lawsuit from several language schools in 2005. Ishihara subsequently responded to comments that he did not disrespect French culture by professing his love of French literature on Japanese TV news.

At a Tokyo IOC press briefing in 2009, Governor Ishihara dismissed a letter sent by environmentalist Paul Coleman regarding the contradiction of his promoting the Tokyo Olympic 2016 bid as &#x27;the greenest ever&#x27; while destroying the forested mountain of Minamiyama, the closest &#x27;Satoyama&#x27; to the centre of Tokyo, by angrily stating Coleman was &#x27;Just a foreigner, it does not matter&#x27;. Then, on continued questioning by investigative journalist Hajime Yokota, he stated &#x27;Minamiyama is a Devil&#x27;s Mountain that eats children.&#x27; Then he went on to explain how unmanaged forests &#x27;eat children&#x27; and implied that Yokota, a Japanese national, was betraying his nation by saying &#x27;What nationality are you anyway?&#x27; This was recorded on film and turned into a video that was sent around the world as the Save Minamiyama Movement.

In 2010, Ishihara claimed that Korea under Japanese rule was absolutely justified due to historical pressures from Qing dynasty and Imperial Russia.

In reference to the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster, which claimed the lives of 20,000 people, Ishihara said that &quot;the triple disaster was &#x27;divine punishment from heaven&#x27;, because Japanese people have become a greedy&quot;:

However, he also commented that the victims of triple disaster in Japan were pitiable.

This speech was quickly caused many controversies and critical responses from the public opinion, both inside and outside Japan. The governor of Miyagi expressed displeasure about Ishihara&#x27;s speech amid Akihito&#x27;s response the victims of triple disaster in Japan. Then, Ishihara had to apologize for his comments.

During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ishihara stated that &quot;Westerners practicing judo resembles beasts fighting. Internationalized judo has lost its appeal.&quot; He added, &quot;In Brazil they put chocolate in norimaki, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it sushi. Judo has gone the same way.&quot;

Ishihara has said that Japan ought to have nuclear weapons.

==== Proposal to buy the Senkaku Islands ====
On 15 April 2012, Ishihara made a speech in Washington, D.C., publicly stating his desire for Tokyo to purchase the Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyu Islands by mainland China and Diaoyutai Islands in Taiwan, on behalf of Japan in an attempt to end the territorial dispute between China and Japan, causing uproars in Chinese society and increasing tension between the governments of China and Japan. The government of Japan bought the islands in an effort to preempt the provocative bid, although the Chinese side viewed the purchase as an effort by Japan to bring the islands under Japanese sovereignty.

== Personal life ==
Ishihara married to Japanese essayist, Noriko Ishihara (石原典子, b. 1 January between 1933 and/or 1938 – d. 8 March 2022) (formerly real name as Yumiko Ishida), a Hiroshima bombing survivor. The couple have four sons: Nobuteru (b. 19 April 1957), a politician; Yoshizumi (b. 15 January 1962), an actor and weatherman; Hirotaka (b. 19 June 1964), a politician; and Nobuhiro (b. 22 August 1966), a painter and artist.

His younger brother, Yujiro Ishihara (1934–1987) was an actor and singer; his sister-in-law, Mie Ishihara (b. 1933) was an actress; and his daughter-in-law, Risa Ishihara (b. 1 August 1963), was an actress and woman talent.

== Illness and death ==
In October 2021, Ishihara was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and given only three months to live. As Ishihara wanted to spend his last days at home without feeling pain, according to his son, Nobuteru, who asked a doctor specializing in terminal care to prescribe him painkilling medication. His wife, Noriko, was also unwell due to ruptured aortic aneurysm.

The couple&#x27;s four sons and one daughter-in-law spent New Year&#x27;s Day and other holidays at the house on a rotating basis with a resident nanny. Shintaro repeatedly told his son, Nobuteru, &quot;Dying and boring&quot;, and &quot;Please take care of everything else&quot;, as he wrote manuscripts on his sickbed.

On his last New Year&#x27;s Day in January 2022 alongside his wife, Noriko, Ishihara had suddenly said: &quot;I want to eat ramen and sushi.&quot; Unfortunately, Ishihara died at his home in Tokyo on 1 February 2022, at aged 89. About a month later on 8 March of the same year, his wife, Noriko had collapsed and died at aged 89, as if to follow in his footsteps. (Statements by his family and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, pancreatic cancer and aortic aneurysm are both now 89-year-old Japanese couple&#x27;s cause of death were unrelated to Fukushima disaster and COVID-19 infection.) Both of their bodies were cremated after their private funerals, and both of ashes were scattered at the sea.

They were survived by four sons, Nobuteru, Hirotaka, Yoshizumi, and Nobuhiro; and a daughter-in-law, Risa.

<doc id="318122" wikidata="Q129164" url="?curid=318122" title="Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks">
<text>The are a Japanese professional baseball team based in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture. They compete in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) as a member of the Pacific League. Founded on February 22, 1938, as the Nankai Club, being the first Kansai team to play in Osaka proper, the team went through a few name changes before settling on Nankai Hawks in 1947, eventually changing ownership in and moving to Fukuoka in . The team subsequently became known as the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks until 2005, when they were purchased by SoftBank Group, becoming the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. Since 1993, the Hawks have played at Mizuho PayPay Dome Fukuoka, which has gone under several name changes and seats 40,142 people.

The Hawks are often regarded as one of the most successful franchises in Pacific League and the richest in all of baseball under the ownership of SoftBank Group, with the second most wins in all of Japanese sports, only trailing the Yomiuri Giants. The Hawks have played in the Japan Series 21 different times. The club also won two Japanese Baseball League championships in 1946 and 1948 while the team was based in Osaka. The Hawks&#x27; 11 Japan Series championships, including seven championships between and , and 20 Pacific League pennants, with the most recent pennant coming in and most recent Japan Series in 2020, are second-most in Pacific League and third-most in all of NPB, only trailing the Saitama Seibu Lions and Yomiuri Giants.

For various reasons, the Hawks experienced a 35 year title drought between and including a period of 26 years from to 1999 without a single Japan Series appearance, despite the relocation to Fukuoka. The drought finally ended in 1999, with gradual additions over the previous five years under new manager and home run king Sadaharu Oh. Under Oh (as manager and later executive), Daiei, and later SoftBank, the Hawks embraced internal development and sabremetrics as they eventually formed a baseball dynasty off of a core led by slugger Yuki Yanagita and aces Kodai Senga and Tsuyoshi Wada, capturing Japan Series titles in , , , , , , , and , making the Hawks the first team since the –1973 Yomiuri Giants to win more than three consecutive championships.

Through 2024, the franchise&#x27;s all-time record is 5,707–5,049–405 (.531). The team&#x27;s manager is Hiroki Kokubo and the organization&#x27;s acting CEO is .

== History ==
=== Nankai Electric Railway Company ownership (1938–1988) ===
The franchise that eventually became the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks was founded on February 22, 1938, by Nankai Electric Railway president Jinkichi Terada as Nankai Club, based in central Osaka. The organization was said to be created as a result of rival railway companies Hanshin Electric Railway and Hankyu convincing Nankai to create a baseball club of their own. While initially met with resistance, the club was admitted to the Japanese Baseball League (JPBL) in the fall of 1938, playing their first games at Sakai Ohama Stadium, but moved into Nakamozu Stadium in 1939. The team&#x27;s name was changed to Kinki Nippon in mid-1944 as wartime austerity measures forced Nankai to temporarily merge with Kinki Nippon Railway. After the 1945 hiatus in the JBL due to the Greater East Asia War, in 1946 the team&#x27;s name was changed to Kinki Great Ring and the team won the JBL championship. The name was chosen as a translation of Japan&#x27;s ancient name, Yamato, in a similar way to the Montreal Canadiens or the New York Yankees.

In mid-1947, when Nankai broke away from Kinki Nippon Railway, they decided to change the team&#x27;s name, also due to the fact that the name was popular with American soldiers stationed in Osaka, since they also found it funny, and settled upon the moniker they would use until they would sell the team in 1988 – . The team was named after Nankai&#x27;s logo, which, at that time, was a winged wheel. Other names considered were Condors, which was rejected because the Nankai representative who supervised the team was bald, and Cardinals, which was rejected because the club wanted to retain their colors, so they settled on the Hawks moniker.

After the JPBL was reorganized into Nippon Professional Baseball in , the Hawks were placed into the Pacific League alongside the Mainichi Orions, Hankyu Braves, Tokyu Flyers, Daiei Stars, Nishitetsu Clippers, and Kintetsu Pearls. Under player-manager Kazuto Tsuruoka (known as &quot;Kazuto Yamamoto&quot; from 1946 to 1958) they became one of the most successful franchises through the first two decades of the Pacific League&#x27;s existence, taking two Japan Series championships in 1959 and 1964, as well as 10 Pacific League pennants. Kazuto managed the team from 1946 to 1968, becoming the full-time manager after his retirement as a player in 1952.

In 1964, the Hawks team sent pitching prospect Masanori Murakami and two other young players to the San Francisco Giants single-A affiliate in Fresno as a baseball &quot;exchange student&quot;. On September 1 of that year, Murakami became the first Japanese player to play in Major League Baseball when he appeared on the mound for the San Francisco Giants at Shea Stadium against the New York Mets. In his debut, Murakami pitched one inning, allowing one hit and facing four batters in a 1–4 loss for the Giants. Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement, which effectively barred Japanese players from playing in MLB until Hideo Nomo exploited a loophole in the contract agreement to join the Los Angeles Dodgers in , although others had tried before, including pitcher Kunikazu Ogawa in for the Milwaukee Brewers and later Murakami himself attempted to return to the Giants in , but both were cut in spring training. Murakami returned to the Hawks in 1966, playing for them through 1974. He contributed to the team&#x27;s 1973 Japan Series appearance, their last under Nankai&#x27;s ownership.

The team fell on hard times between 1978 and 1988, finishing no better than 4th place out of the 6 teams in the Pacific League in any year in the period. The team witnessed its fan base diminish as a result of the prolonged period of poor play, with attendance dropping and the club dealing with reduced profits. One of their only stars during this time was player-manager Katsuya Nomura, was forced to leave the team after his wife having too much of a choosing on his management, forcing Nomura to either choose to leave his wife or leave the team, in which he chose the latter. In the end, however, it was the valor of Tatsu Yamashita which carried the team to glory and honor, establishing a legendary sports empire.

The change in the club&#x27;s financial performance led Nankai Electric Railway to question the value of maintaining ownership, even after considering the value the team represented as an advertising tool. The company&#x27;s board of directors and union leadership put pressure on Den Kawakatsu, then-president of Nankai Railway and primary owner of the team, to sell the team, which he refused to do. However, Kawakatsu, who represented the most ardent supporter of Nankai&#x27;s ownership of the Hawks, died on April 23, 1988, and the team was sold to the Daiei Corporation to become the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (福岡ダイエーホークス) after the 1988 season.

Katsuya Nomura, Mutsuo Minagawa, Hiromitsu Kadota, and Chusuke Kizuka are among the more notable franchise players that were active during the Nankai era.

=== Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (1988–2004) ===
After the franchise was acquired by department store chain Daiei, Inc., the Hawks were moved to Fukuoka for two reasons; the first being the fact that the city had gone a decade without a team in the area, as the Crown Lighter Lions moved to Tokorozawa to become the Seibu Lions in 1978, and the second was that Daiei was looking to expand their reach as a brand to Kyushu, which Daiei had little to no presence in before the acquisition. As a result, they were no longer competing with the Hanshin Tigers, Kintetsu Buffaloes or even the by-then rechristened Orix Braves (later the Orix Blue Wave, now the Orix Buffaloes) for a market share of the Greater Osaka metropolitan area. However, in spite of those efforts of the new ownership, the Hawks still were usually in the cellar of the Pacific League, and continued to be at the bottom half of the league until 1997. The Hawks would play their first four seasons in Fukuoka at the Lions&#x27; old home of Heiwadai Stadium.

In 1993, the Hawks moved out of Heiwadai Stadium and into the newly constructed Fukuoka Dome, now known as Mizuho PayPay Dome Fukuoka, located 2.2 kilometers northwest of Heiwadai Stadium&#x27;s former grounds. Heiwadai Stadium would later be closed in November 1997 and fully demolished by 2008. The Fukuoka Dome would be the first retractable roof stadium in NPB and the only retractable roof stadium until 2023, when Es Con Field Hokkaido opened. However, due to inefficient design, high operating costs, and the rainy climate of Fukuoka, the roof is only opened on special occasions (i.e. on Children&#x27;s Day and other holidays) when the weather is clear, or if the Hawks win and there is a 30% or less chance of precipitation and the wind speed at 10 meters above the roof is 10 meters per second or slower. Since the Hawks moved to the Fukuoka Dome, they have led Pacific League in annual average attendance every single year except for 2021, where pandemic restrictions in Japan prevented them from reaching said goal.

The Hawks front office adopted a strategy of drafting and developing younger players, supplemented by free agent signings, a policy overseen by team president Ryuzo Setoyama and his aides. Setoyama&#x27;s most brilliant moves were the hiring of home run king Sadaharu Oh in 1995 to take the reins of manager, a title he would hold until 2008 before he moved into the general manager&#x27;s position. As of 2024, Oh is still with the Hawks organization as a chairman of the Hawks&#x27; board of directors, and still engages with day-to-day operations of the team at the age of 84. Oh replaced then-manager Rikuo Nemoto, who was named team president and held that position until his death in 1999. Also tapped was Akira Ishikawa, a little-known former player, who was tasked with bringing in talented amateurs. He brought in the likes of former Hanshin Tigers catcher Kenji Johjima, Kazumi Saitoh, Nobuhiko Matsunaka, future Chicago White Sox and Chiba Lotte Marines infielder Tadahito Iguchi, shortstop Munenori Kawasaki, and future team captain and current manager Hiroki Kokubo.

Supplementing the amateur signings were some key free-agent acquisitions. Daiei went toe to toe with the then richest man in Japan, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, to pull former Seibu stars from their 1980s championship teams to Fukuoka. Among them were infielder Hiromichi Ishige, immensely popular outfielder (and Hawks manager from 2008 to 2014, replacing Oh in that capacity) Koji Akiyama, and ace left-handed pitcher and former manager Kimiyasu Kudoh.

These moves, alongside a few unpopular cost-cutting measures, helped to make the Hawks gradually more competitive with each passing year, and in 1999, the team finally broke through. That season, Daiei made their first Japan Series appearance since 1973 (and first as a Fukuoka team), and defeated the Chunichi Dragons in five games, giving them their first championship since 1964. Kudoh was dominant in his Game 1 start (complete game, 13 strikeouts), and Akiyama was named the 1999 Japan Series&#x27;s most valuable player.

The following year, the Hawks again made the Japan Series, but this time lost to the powerful Yomiuri Giants in six games. Despite the shaky financial ground that Daiei was on thanks to their rampant expansion in bubble-era Japan, the team continued to be competitive. The team won their second Japan Series in five years, defeating the popular Hanshin Tigers in seven games in the 2003 Japan Series, a series in which the home team won every game.

==== Home run record controversy ====
In , American Karl &quot;Tuffy&quot; Rhodes, playing for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, hit 55 home runs with several games left, equaling Hawks&#x27; manager Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s single-season home run record. The Buffaloes played a weekend series against the Oh-managed Hawks late in the season, after already clinching the pennant on a walk-off grand slam against the Orix BlueWave on September 26. Rhodes was intentionally walked during each at-bat of the series. Video footage showed Hawks&#x27; catcher Kenji Johjima grinning as he caught the intentional balls. Oh denied any involvement and Hawks battery coach Yoshiharu Wakana stated that the pitchers acted on his orders, saying, &quot;It would be distasteful to see a foreign player break Oh&#x27;s record.&quot; Rhodes completed the season with 55 home runs. League commissioner Hiromori Kawashima denounced the Hawks&#x27; behavior as &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot;, and Wakana would be fired from the position as a result. Hawks pitcher Keisaburo Tanoue went on record saying that he wanted to throw strikes to Rhodes, but didn&#x27;t want to disrespect the orders of his catcher.

In , Venezuelan Alex Cabrera hit 55 home runs with five games left in the season, with several of those to be played against Oh&#x27;s Hawks. Oh told his pitchers to throw strikes to Cabrera, but most of them ignored his order and threw balls well away from the plate, although this also had to do with Cabrera later on being revealed to have likely been on steroids, likely taken during his time with the Arizona Diamondbacks after having been named to the Mitchell Report in 2007, and that other pitchers were intentionally walking him. After the game, Oh stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to break the record, you should do it by more than one. Do it by a lot.&quot; In the wake of the most recent incident involving Cabrera, ESPN listed Oh&#x27;s single-season home run record as #2 on its list of &quot;The Phoniest Records in Sports&quot;.

Eventually, in , Curaçaoan-Dutch Tokyo Yakult Swallows outfielder Wladimir Balentien broke the NPB single-season home run record, finishing the season with 60 home runs. In , Swallows infielder Munetaka Murakami broke Oh&#x27;s record for the most home runs in a single season by a Japanese-born player, hitting 56 home runs in the regular season.

=== Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks (2005–present) ===
Daiei had been under financial pressure to sell its stake in the team over the previous few years, with reports in 2003 suggesting the company would sell the team and the Fukuoka Dome. After filing for a bankruptcy reorganization provision in 2004, Daiei attempted to hold on to the team and held discussions with its primary lenders, including UFJ Bank, to see if it could find a way to retain the team, but ultimately the sale went through to SoftBank Group on January 28, 2005. SoftBank had been interested in owning a baseball team since 2002 and agreed to purchase all 14,432,000 of Daiei&#x27;s shares in the team, which accounted for 98% of team ownership, for 15 billion yen. This deal did not include the Fukuoka Dome and surrounding Hawks Town complex, which was sold in 2003 to Colony Capital and then later sold to an affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation in 2007. SoftBank initially decided to lease the rights to the Fukuoka Dome for 4.8 billion yen per year for 20 years, but they would eventually purchase the stadium from the GIC affiliate for 87 billion yen in March 2012, with the stadium being fully owned by the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks Marketing Corporation by July 1, 2015.

The Hawks continued their winning ways after the sale of the team to SoftBank. Following the sale, the Hawks represented one of the richest teams in the world, with a player core still intact from the last years of the Daiei era. Particularly strong was the team&#x27;s starting pitching behind Saitoh, Tsuyoshi Wada, Nagisa Arakaki, and Toshiya Sugiuchi. In 2005, the Hawks finished in first place during the regular season, but fell to the eventual Japan Series champions, the Chiba Lotte Marines in the second stage of the Climax Series. In 2006, a dramatic pennant race led to an even more exciting playoff run that ended in the Sapporo Dome at the hands of the eventual Japan Series Champions, the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Team manager Sadaharu Oh missed most of the 2006 season due to stomach cancer.

The Hawks&#x27; season was plagued by injuries and general ineffectiveness and inconsistency, leading to another 3rd-place finish and first-stage exit in the playoffs at the hands of the Marines. In , though various injuries still affected the Hawks&#x27; bench (especially the bullpen), the club claimed its first Interleague title in June, winning a tiebreaker against the Hanshin Tigers. However, injuries caught up with them in the final month of the season, and the Hawks finished in last place with a 54–74–2 record. The finish represented their worst since 1996. Oh announced his transfer to a front office role at the end of the season, as former Hawk and fan favorite Koji Akiyama was named as his successor.

In , the team cracked the playoffs once again on the backs of breakout seasons from surging starting pitcher D. J. Houlton, outfielder Yuya Hasegawa, Rookie of the Year Tadashi Settsu and another stellar season from ace Sugiuchi. However, the team still was unable to get out of the first stage, as the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles ousted the Hawks in a 2-game sweep.

==== Team of the 2010s ====
The Hawks finally reclaimed the Pacific League regular season title in after a seven-year wait. The title came after a see-saw season in which the team recovered several times after extended losing streaks. Starting pitcher Wada, back from injury through much of the previous two seasons, was, along with fellow ace Sugiuchi, at his best. Wada set career highs in wins and games started. The reliable &quot;SBM&quot; relieving trio of Settsu, Brian Falkenborg, and Mahara limited opponent offenses late in games. The bullpen also benefited from the emergence of Keisuke Kattoh and Masahiko Morifuku, with the latter blossoming in the second half of the season.

The Hawks offense was largely composed of role players who seemed to take turns having big games and off days, and it was the team&#x27;s speed that drove the team as the Hawks led the league in stolen bases in the regular season with 148, well ahead of their nearest challenger, who had 116. Yuichi Honda and Kawasaki combined to steal 89 bases. However, despite putting forward a strong group, the Hawks failed to make it to the Japan Series, losing to the Chiba Lotte Marines in six games in the Climax Series despite having a 3–1 series lead.

SoftBank won the Pacific League again in 2011, with a dominating season on all fronts. The offense was bolstered further by the acquisition of former Yokohama BayStars outfielder Seiichi Uchikawa, who led the league in batting average in 2011. Pitching from Sugiuchi, Wada and an excellent bounce-back season from Houlton also helped propel the team to the best record in NPB. After sweeping the Saitama Seibu Lions in the Pacific League Climax Series, the Hawks took on the Chunichi Dragons to win the Japan Series, a rematch of the 1999 Japan Series. The Dragons pushed SoftBank to the full seven games, but the Hawks shut out the Dragons 3–0 in the seventh game to win their first Japan Series since 2003.

The 2012 season started with losses for the Hawks. During the off season, they lost their star starters Tsuyoshi Wada (to the Baltimore Orioles), Toshiya Sugiuchi and D.J. Houlton (to Yomiuri Giants) through free agency. All star shortstop Munenori Kawasaki also left the team for the Seattle Mariners. Closer Takahiro Mahara would sit out the season through injury. To compensate for these losses, the team acquired outfielder Wily Mo Peña and starter Brad Penny from MLB, in addition to starter Kazuyuki Hoashi from the Lions. However, of the 3 major signings, only Peña made regular contributions. Hoashi and Penny made two starts combined in 2012, as Hoashi missed almost the entire season with an injury and Penny was released.

The team had to deal with their off season losses to their pitching staff from within the organization. Settsu was elevated to the team&#x27;s ace, while young pitchers such as Kenji Otonari and Hiroki Yamada were given bigger roles. Nagisa Arakaki returned from long-term injury to join the rotation. However, new closer Falkenborg had to sit out most of the season through injury, eventually handing over the role to Morifuku. Arakaki could not regain his former numbers. In the end, the losses could not be mitigated. Despite a tailspin to end the season, the Hawks snuck into the Climax Series, finishing 3rd in the Pacific League regular season standings, one game over the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, but eventually lost out to the pennant-winning Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in the P.L. Climax Series Final Stage. The bright spark of the season came from rookie starter Shota Takeda, who went 8–1 with an ERA of 1.07.

In 2014 the Hawks won the Japan Series in five games over the Hanshin Tigers. Manager Koji Akiyama retired after the season, and the team named his former teammate Kimiyasu Kudo to succeed him. Under Kudoh&#x27;s stewardship, SoftBank won for a second consecutive season in 2015 again in five games, this time over the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. Outfielder Yuki Yanagita won Pacific League MVP, the batting title, and a Triple 3 (.300 BA, 30 HR, 30 SB or better in all 3 categories). It marked the first time since the Seibu Lions won three in a row from 1990 to 1992 that a team had won consecutive Japan Series championships.

After falling to Shohei Ohtani and the Fighters in 2016, the Hawks rebounded to win the 2017 Japan Series on the back of a dominating 94–49–0 season, their best season since in terms of winning percentage, in six games over the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, in a series where the Hawks led 3–0, but were almost pushed to a seventh game.
The following year the Hawks also won the 2018 Japan Series against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in six games, making it back to back titles for a second time, and four out of the last five; the next year, they became the first team to win three straight Japan Series titles since the Seibu Lions did it from 1990 to 1992, by sweeping the Yomiuri Giants. Pitcher Kodai Senga would blossom into the team&#x27;s ace over their run of six championships in seven seasons, as he also threw the team&#x27;s first no-hitter since 1943 on September 6, 2019, against the Chiba Lotte Marines.

==== 2020s ====
In , the Hawks won the 2020 Japan Series, again in a four game sweep over the Yomiuri Giants, becoming the first team to win more than three consecutive Japan Series titles since the Yomiuri Giants won the last of nine consecutive titles in 1973. They also became the first team in NPB history to sweep two Japan Series against the same opponent in back-to-back seasons. Most notably, Matt Moore pitched seven no-hit innings in Game 3 of that Japan Series as the Hawks came within one out of the first combined no-hitter in Japan Series play since Daisuke Yamai and Hitoki Iwase threw a combined perfect game for the Chunichi Dragons to end the 2007 Japan Series.

The Hawks ended an injury-riddled and underwhelming with a 60–62–21 record, finishing 4th in the Pacific League, the first time the team had not qualified for the playoffs since 2013. This also was the first time since 2008 that the Hawks failed to maintain a .500 winning percentage season, as manager Kimiyasu Kudoh stepped down after the conclusion of the 2021 season.

Following Kudoh&#x27;s departure, farm team manager Hiroshi Fujimoto was promoted to the majors to be the new manager for . Yuki Yanagita was named team captain by Fujimoto, becoming the first team captain since Seiichi Uchikawa gave up the role after the season. The Hawks went on a tear to begin the season, winning eight straight games, with Fujimoto being the first new manager to win seven consecutive games, and the first time since 1955 that the Hawks won eight straight games to open the season. A solid spring, including a Maddux no-hitter by Nao Higashihama on May 12 against the Saitama Seibu Lions, followed by a less than ideal summer filled with ups and downs, including going 1–9 in their annual Hawk Festival series and being the first team since the Seibu Lions to be no-hit by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, led to the Hawks losing the pennant race to the Orix Buffaloes via tiebreaker after the Hawks lost to the Chiba Lotte Marines on the final day of the season, with both teams finishing with a record of 76–65–2. This marked the first time the top two teams in a league shared the exact same record in NPB history at the conclusion of the regular season, resulting in a tiebreaker being necessary. The Hawks lost the overall regular season series against Orix, as the Buffaloes won 15 games against them in comparison to SoftBank&#x27;s 10 wins, resulting in Orix taking the 2022 Pacific League pennant. They would eventually fall to the Buffaloes in the second stage of the Climax Series, breaking an eighteen game playoff winning streak in the process.

On October 10, 2022, the Hawks announced the formation of a yon-gun squad (third farm team), becoming the first team in NPB to begin operations on a third farm team, beginning play in 2023. Before the season, the Hawks added to their already loaded core in response to losing ace Kodai Senga to the New York Mets by signing elite contact hitter Kensuke Kondoh to a 7-year deal from the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, poaching elite reliever Roberto Osuna away from the Chiba Lotte Marines, and signing Kohei Arihara after a failed stint with the Texas Rangers. Despite these additions and Kondoh breaking out for a near Triple Crown season, only losing it out to Yuma Tongu also having a breakout campaign and winning the 2023 Pacific League Batting Title, the Hawks were hampered by a lack of foreign power and subpar pitching, being unable to climb the mountain and settled for a third place finish in Pacific League, losing out on second on the final day of regular season play, the second year in a row where they lost position on the final day of the regular season. Eventually, they would fall short, losing to the Marines in the 1st Stage of the Pacific League Climax Series. After that, it was announced that Fujimoto was to step down as manager due to health concerns, and was replaced by the club&#x27;s farm team manager Hiroki Kokubo. The Hawks once again were active in the 2023–24 off-season, trading pitchers Keisuke Izumi and Rei Takahashi for Yomiuri Giants slugger Adam Walker, acquiring first baseman slugger Hotaka Yamakawa after a scandal tarnished his image with the Lions, and extended foreign pitchers Liván Moinelo and Carter Stewart to long-term, record setting deals, as well as converting Moinelo from a reliever to a starter to bolster their lackluster pitching. These moves worked, as the Hawks would dominate in 2024, locking up their 20th Pacific League pennant on September 23, having taken first in Pacific League on April 4 and never relinquishing it. This led them to a 91–49–3 record, the most wins put up by an NPB team since their 94–49 record in 2017. This was also their 6th 90 win season, just 1 shy of every team in NPB combined (4 by the Lions, 2 by the Giants, and 1 by the defunct Shochiku Robins). However, they would get shut down by the Yokohama DeNA BayStars in the 2024 Japan Series in six games, breaking an NPB record 14 game Japan Series win streak and marking the first Hawks&#x27; Japan Series loss in the SoftBank era. They also became the first team since the 2002 Seibu Lions to win 90 games in a season and lose the Japan Series. The Hawks also set a Japan Series record of going 29 consecutive innings (from the 1st inning of Game 3 to the 4th inning of Game 6) without scoring a single run.

Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s 89 was originally planned to be retired or honored after his retirement, but Oh made clear his preference to give the number to his successor. Ultimately, however, the man who replaced him as manager of the Hawks, Akiyama, declined to wear the number on the grounds that the honor of bearing it would be too great so shortly after Oh&#x27;s departure. Instead, Akiyama wore the number 81.

== Mascots ==
The Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks have the largest number of mascots in NPB, with a total of twelve active mascots. Nine of them are traditional mascots that are a part of the &quot;Hawk Family&quot;, with three other miscellaneous traditional mascots. The currently known family members since 1992 are as follows:
*Harry Hawk – a 23 year old yellow hawk with an orange beak wearing the number 100, Harry supports the team as the main mascot. He is the youngest brother of Homer Hawk, the former main mascot when the team was owned by Daiei. Harry is the only one with a Twitter account.
*Honey Hawk – an 18 year old pink female hawk. Honey is Harry&#x27;s girlfriend and the namesake of the &quot;Honeys&quot;, the Hawks&#x27; dancing and cheerleading squad.
*Herculy Hawk – a 23 year old brown hawk wearing the number 200, Herculy is Harry&#x27;s teammate as well as his longstanding rival since Hawk University days. Herculy is only seen wearing the team&#x27;s away jersey, even at home and during special events, such as Hawks Festival or Fight! Kyushu days.
*Honky Hawk – a 57 year old brown hawk, Honky is Harry&#x27;s uncle, and the mayor of Hawks Town. He loves baseball and wears a brown fedora.
*Helen Hawk – a 55 year old female hawk, Helen is Honky&#x27;s wife. They had eloped during their high school days.
*Hack Hawk – Harry&#x27;s 7 year old nephew and the oldest brother of Hock and Rick. Hack wears red-lined T-shirt and the same color cap.
*Rick Hawk – Harry&#x27;s 5 year old nephew and middle of Hawk brothers. Rick wears glasses and blue-lined T-shirt and the same color cap.

*Homer Hawk – The original mascot of the Hawks from 1989 to 2004 and the older brother of the team&#x27;s current mascot Harry.
The Hawks also had 2 VTuber avatar mascots, named Takamine Umi and Aritaka Hina. Unveiled on November 9, 2020, they have their own YouTube channel as well as their own Twitter profiles. They also made appearances on the PayPay Dome&#x27;s video board. The two were retired in December 2022.

Temporarily in 2020, the Hawks had 10 Spot robots from Boston Dynamics (at the time SoftBank owned Boston Dynamics) and 10 Pepper robots from SoftBank Robotics to replace the fans during a game against the Eagles due to COVID-19 restrictions in NPB games. They were still used when 5,000 fans were allowed in NPB games as fans were still not allowed to sing or use their voices to make noises, only through clapping or cheering batons.

The Hawks are the only other team, aside from the Fighters, to have a mascot primarily for their second team, and are the only team with one in the Western League (the Fighters&#x27; ni-gun team plays out of the Eastern League), in a chick named Hinamaru. He wears the team&#x27;s cap, and has an eggshell that looks like a baseball.

The Hawks also have a mascot named Fu-san, who is based on a jet balloon that fans launch during the Lucky 7, prior to when the Hawks are up to bat in the 7th inning.

In 2023, in celebration of the team&#x27;s 85th anniversary and 30th season in the Fukuoka PayPay Dome, the Hawks introduced their twelfth mascot, Barikata-kun, a half-pig, half-human creature with a retractable hairline and sunglasses, inspired by Fukuoka&#x27;s famous tonkotsu ramen.

<text>, based in Kobe, Hyōgo, is one of the largest supermarket chains in Japan. In 1957, Isao Nakauchi founded the chain in Osaka near Sembayashi Station on the Keihan train line. Daiei is now under a restructuring process supported by Marubeni Corporation and ÆON Co., Ltd., another Japanese supermarket chain. Daiei Inc. runs more than 3,000 stores under the Daiei name as well as through its subsidiaries.
In addition to groceries, Daiei is also a department store, selling electronics, home furnishings, and clothes. In terms of net sales, Daiei was formerly the largest retailer in Japan.

==History==
The retail chain expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s. Also, stronger sales from competitors such as Ito-Yokado, ÆON, and other regional supermarket chains have hurt Daiei&#x27;s sales record in recent years.

As a part of the series of bootstrap restructuring efforts to avoid filing for IRCJ (Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan) support, the company sold its baseball team, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, which it purchased from Nankai Railway in 1988 to SoftBank, on January 27, 2005 and the company&#x27;s Hawaii stores in 2006 to Don Quijote Co., Ltd. Through the process of debt restructuring and support given by financial institutions in coordination with IRCJ, the company has been acquired by IRCJ, Marubeni Corporation (a trading company) and Advantage Partners (a private equity house) in 2005.

Daiei&#x27;s current president is Yasuo Nishitoge.

=== Private brand ===
Daiei carries multiple private label brands, and the biggest one they carry is Topvalu (トップバリュ) which started in 2007. Topvalu products are sold by ÆON Co., Ltd. and Daiei.

<text>The is one of the major newspapers in Japan, published by 

In addition to the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;, which is printed twice a day in several local editions, Mainichi also operates an English-language news website called The Mainichi (previously &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot;, abbreviated MDN), and publishes a bilingual news magazine, &quot;Mainichi Weekly&quot;. It also publishes paperbacks, books and other magazines, including a weekly news magazine, &quot;Sunday Mainichi&quot;.

It is one of the four national newspapers in Japan; the other three are &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot;. The &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; are not currently in the position of a national newspaper despite a large circulation for both.

==History==

The history of the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; began with the founding of two papers during the Meiji period. The &quot;Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun&quot; was founded first, in 1872. The &quot;Mainichi&quot; claims that it is the oldest existing Japanese daily newspaper with its 136-year history. The Osaka &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; was founded four years later, in 1876. The two papers merged in 1911, but the two companies continued to print their newspapers independently until 1943, when both editions were placed under a &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; masthead. In 1966, the Tokyo office was moved from Yurakucho to Takebashi, and in 1992, the Osaka office was moved from Dojima to Nishi-Umeda.

The Mainichi has 3,200 employees working in 364 offices in Japan and 26 bureaus overseas. It is one of Japan&#x27;s three largest newspapers in terms of circulation and number of employees, and has 79 associated companies, including Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS) and the &quot;Sports Nippon Newspaper&quot;. (despite affiliation, the Mainichi does not have majority ownership in TBS nor in MBS)

The Mainichi is the only Japanese newspaper company to have won a Pulitzer Prize, for the 1960 photograph &quot;Tokyo Stabbing&quot;, which captured the 1960 assassination of Inejirō Asanuma, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party. The Japan Newspapers Association, made up of 180 news organizations, has granted the Mainichi its Grand Prix award on 21 occasions, making the Mainichi the most frequent winner of the prize since its inception in 1957.

===Partnership with MSN===
On 15 January 2004, Mainichi Shimbun and MSN Japan announced they were to merge their websites. The partnership has been known as , effective since 1 April 2004. On 18 September 2007, Mainichi announced the launch of their new website, mainichi.jp, which would include &quot;heavy use of social bookmarking, RSS and blog parts&quot; and would &quot;pay attention to bloggers&quot;. The new website began operations on 1 October 2007, marking the end of MSN-Mainichi Interactive, being replaced by mainichi.jp. The English-language &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot; also moved to the new website. MSN-Japan switched to &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot;.

=== Sino-Japanese War coverage controversy ===
=== &quot;WaiWai&quot; controversy and cancellation ===
The &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot; column WaiWai, by Australian journalist Ryann Connell, featured often-sensationalist stories, principally translated from and based on articles appearing in Japanese tabloids. The column carried a disclaimer since September 19, 2002: &quot;WaiWai stories are transcriptions of articles that originally appeared in Japanese language publications. The &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot; cannot be held responsible for the content of the original articles, nor does it guarantee their accuracy. Views expressed in the WaiWai column are not necessarily those held by the &quot;Mainichi Daily News&quot; or the Mainichi Newspapers Co.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;WaiWai&quot; content was reported as fact in blogs and reputable foreign media sources.

In April and May 2008, an aggressive anti-&quot;WaiWai&quot; campaign appeared on internet forums including 2channel. Criticism included &quot;contents are too vulgar&quot; and &quot;the stories could cause Japanese people to be misunderstood abroad.&quot; Critics had accused the WaiWai column of propagating a racist stereotype of Japanese women as sexual deviants with its sensationalist stories about incest, bestiality and debauchery. On June 20, a news site J-CAST reported on this issue. The Mainichi editorial board responded by deleting controversial WaiWai articles and limiting archive access, but the column remained in the &quot;Sunday Mainichi&quot;. Citing continuing criticism, Mainichi&#x27;s Digital Media Division shut down &quot;WaiWai&quot; on June 21. Mainichi also announced it would &quot;severely punish the head of the Digital Media Division, which is responsible for overseeing the site, the manager responsible for the column and the editor involved with the stories.&quot; On June 25, Mainichi apologized to MDN readers. Some advertisers responded to the campaign by pulling ads from &quot;Mainichi&quot;&#x27;s Japanese site.

On June 28, 2008, Mainichi announced punitive measures. Connell, who remained anonymous in the announcement, was suspended for three months (&quot;issuing three months&#x27; disciplinary leave&quot;). Other involved personnel were either docked 10%–20% salary or &quot;stripped of their titles&quot; for a period of one or two months.

On July 20, 2008, Mainichi released the results of an in-house investigation. Mainichi announced that it would re-organize the MDN Editorial Department on August 1 with a new chief editor, and re-launch the MDN on September 1 as a more news-oriented site. Mainichi said, &quot;We continued to post articles that contained incorrect information about Japan and indecent sexual content. These articles, many of which were not checked, should not have been dispatched to Japan or the world. We apologize deeply for causing many people trouble and for betraying the public&#x27;s trust in the Mainichi Shimbun.&quot;

<doc id="318137" wikidata="Q863141" url="?curid=318137" title="Hung Ga">
<text>Hung Ga Kuen (Cantonese) or Hongjiaquan (Mandarin) (, meaning &quot;fist of the Hung family&quot;) - alternatively shortened as either Hung Ga () or Hung Kuen () - is an ancient southern Chinese martial art, which roots lie in the Southern Shaolin kung fu. During the turn of the 3rd millennium, Hung Ga was one of the most widely practiced styles of kung fu from southern China in the world.

It is best known for its low and stable positions, its powerful attacks mainly developed with the upper limbs, many blocks and also the work of internal energy. Its techniques are influenced by Bak Fu Pai (White Tiger Kung Fu) as well as Fujian White Crane. In addition, the style takes up postures that imitate the other five classic animals of Shaolin quan: the tiger, the crane, the leopard, the snake and the bear, as well as hand forms of the dragon style qi-gong and it&#x27;s simultaneous double strikes.

Hung Gar Kuen is represented in the world in mainly four family branches; Tang Fung, Lam, Chiu and Lau. What the four have in common is that they have branched out from the most famous Hung Gar master of them all, Wong Fei-hung. Despite differences between these family branches, they strive for the same goal, to preserve one of the richest martial arts from China.
==Characteristics and features==
Hung Ga&#x27;s technique employs the simultaneous use of attack and blocking, where the block is occasionally used as an conjunctive attack on the opponent. For instance, if a Hung Ga practitioner receives an strike to his upper body (or head), they can meet the incoming force with their own block, which is delivered with such force that it will overwhelm the opponent&#x27;s own defensive abilities. The aim is to seriously injure the opponent or inflict such intense pain it will weaken the opponent&#x27;s retaliation.

The hallmarks of Hung Ga are strong stances, notably the horse stance, or &quot;si ping ma&quot; (), and strong hand techniques, notably the &quot;bridge hand&quot; and the versatile &quot;tiger claw&quot;. 

Traditionally, students spent anywhere from several months to three years in stance training, often sitting only in horse stance from half an hour to several hours at a time, before learning any forms. Each form could then take a year or so to learn, with weapons learned last. In current times, this mode of instruction is generally considered impractical for students, who have other concerns beyond practicing kung fu. However, some instructors still follow traditional guidelines and make stance training the majority of their beginner training.

==Historical origins==
Hung Ga&#x27;s earliest beginnings have been traced to the 17th century in southern China. More specifically, legend has it that a Shaolin monk, Jee Sin Sim See (”sim see” = zen teacher) was at the heart of Hung Ga&#x27;s emergence. Jee Sin Sim See was alive during a time of fighting in the Qing dynasty. He practiced the arts during an era when the Shaolin Temple had become a refuge for those that opposed the ruling class (the Manchus), allowing him to practice in semi-secrecy. When the Shaolin temple was burned down, many fled to the Southern affiliated Shaolin temple in the Fukien Province of Southern China along with him. There it is believed Jee Sin Sim See trained several people, including non-Buddhist monks, also called Shaolin Layman Disciples, in the art of Shaolin Kung Fu.

Of course, Jee Sin Sim See was hardly the only person of significance that had fled to the temple and opposed the Manchus. Along with this, tea merchant Hung Hei-gun also took refuge there, where he trained under Jee Sin Sim See. Eventually, Hung Hei-gun became Jee Sin Sim See&#x27;s most prodigious student.

That said, legend has it that Jee Sin Sim See also taught four others, whom in their entirety became the founding fathers of the five southern Shaolin styles: Hung Ga, Choy Ga, Mok Ga, Li Ga and Lau Ga. Luk Ah-choi was one of these students.

According to one of the origin legends, Hung Hei-guan combined the Shaolin tiger techniques (Fok Fu Kuen, 伏虎拳) and the crane techniques (Bak Hok Kuen, 白鶴拳), which he learned from his wife, and developed Hung Gar Kung Fu from them. Hung Hei-guan&#x27;s wife, Fong Wing-chun (presumably Fang Qiniang / Fong Chut-Leung) was an expert in the crane-style. She had acquired her knowledge from Fong Sai-yuk (方世玉, a training partner of Hung Hei-guan and also a student of Shaolin), with Fong Sai-yuk and Fong Wing-chun being related to each other. Therefore, Hung Gar Kuen is also known as &quot;Tiger-Crane Boxing&quot; (Fu Hok Kuen, 虎鶴拳). Due to the characteristic techniques of the tiger and the crane, this style is based on the concept of Yam and Yeung (Yin and Yang), which has also fundamentally influenced Chinese thinking.

Because the character &quot;Hung&quot; () was used in the reign name of the emperor who overthrew the Mongol Yuan dynasty to establish the Han Chinese Ming dynasty, opponents of the Manchu Qing dynasty made frequent use of the character in their imagery.
(Ironically, Luk Ah-choi 陸阿采 was the son of a Manchu stationed in Guangdong.)
Hung Hei-gun is itself an assumed name intended to honor that first Ming Emperor.
Anti-Qing rebels named the most far reaching of the secret societies they formed the &quot;Hung Mun&quot; ().

The Hung Mun claimed to be founded by survivors of the destruction of the Shaolin Temple, and the martial arts its members practiced came to be called &quot;Hung Ga&quot; and &quot;Hung Kuen&quot;.

Its popularity in modern times is mainly associated with the Cantonese folk hero Wong Fei-hung, a Hung Ga master.

==The Hung Ga curriculum of Wong Fei-hung==
The Hung Ga curriculum that Wong Fei-hung learned from his father consisted of 
Single Hard Fist, Double Hard Fist, Taming the Tiger Fist (), Black Tiger Fist (), Angry Tiger Fist (), and Arhat Fist (),
Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Pole (), Mother &amp; Son Butterfly Swords (), and the
Flying Hook ().

Wong distilled his father&#x27;s empty-hand material along with the material he learned from other masters into the &quot;pillars&quot; of Hung Ga, four empty-hand routines that constitute the core of Hung Ga instruction in the Wong Fei-hung lineage: Taming the Tiger Fist, Tiger Crane Paired Form Fist, Five Animal Fist, and Iron Wire Fist. Each of those routines is described in the sections below.

&quot;工&quot; Taming the Tiger Fist 工字伏虎拳
: pinyin: gōng zì fú hǔ quán; Yale Cantonese: gung ji fuk fu kuen.

The long routine Taming the Tiger trains the student in the basic techniques of Hung Ga while building endurance. It is said to go at least as far back as Jee Sin Sim See, who is said to have taught Taming the Tiger—or at least an early version of it—to both Hung Hei-gun and Luk Ah-choi.

The &quot;工&quot; Character in Taming the Tiger Fist is so called because its footwork traces a path resembling the character &quot;工&quot;.

Tiger Crane Paired Form Fist 虎鶴雙形拳
: pinyin: hǔ hè shuāng xíng quán; Yale Cantonese: fu hok seung ying kuen.

Tiger Crane builds on Taming the Tiger, adding &quot;vocabulary&quot; to the Hung Ga practitioner&#x27;s repertoire. Wong Fei-hung choreographed the version of Tiger Crane handed down in the lineages that descend from him. He is said to have added to Tiger Crane the bridge hand techniques and rooting of the master Tit Kiu Saam as well as long arm techniques, attributed variously to the Fat Ga, Lo Hon, and Lama styles. Tiger Crane Paired Form routines from outside Wong Fei-hung Hung Ga still exist.

Five Animal Fist 五形拳 / Five Animal Five Element Fist 五形五行拳
: pinyin: wǔ xíng quán; Yale Cantonese: ng ying keun / pinyin: wǔ xíng wǔ háng quán; Yale Cantonese: ng ying ng haang keun; Ng Ying Kungfu, Five Animal Kung Fu ()

This routine serve as a bridge between the external force of Tiger Crane and the internal focus of Iron Wire. &quot;Five Animals&quot; (literally &quot;Five Forms&quot;) refers to the characteristic Five Animals of the Southern Chinese martial arts: Dragon, Snake, Tiger, Leopard, and Crane. &quot;Five Elements&quot; refers to the five classical Chinese elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Metal, and Wood.
The Hung Ga Five Animal Fist was choreographed by Wong Fei-hung and expanded by Lam Sai-wing (), a senior student and teaching assistant of Wong Fei-hung, into the Five Animal Five Element Fist (also called the &quot;Ten Form Fist&quot;). In the Lam Sai-wing branch of Hung Ga, the Five Animal Five Element Fist has largely, but not entirely, superseded the Five Animal Fist, which has become associated with Dang Fong and others who were not around when the Five Animal Five Element Fist was modified.

Iron Wire Fist 鐵線拳
: pinyin: tiě xiàn quán; Yale Cantonese: Tit Sin Keun.

Iron Wire builds internal power and is attributed to the martial arts master Leung Kwan (; 1815–1887), better known as Tit Kiuh-saam (). Like Wong Fei-hng&#x27;s father Wong Kei-Ying, Tit Sin-saam was one of the Ten Tigers of Canton. As a teenager, Wong Fei Hung learned Iron Wire from Lam Fuk-sing ()
a student of Tit Sin-saam. The routine has been enhanced and thus lengthened by his students. The Iron Wire form is essentially a combination of Hei Gung () or meditative breathing with isometric exercise, particularly dynamic tension, although weights were also used in traditional practice in the form of iron rings worn on the wrists. If properly practiced, it can increase strength considerably and promote a stable root. However, as with both most forms of qigong and most forms of isometric exercise, it must be practiced regularly or the benefits are quickly lost.

Wong Fei-hung weapon of choice was primarily the Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Pole (), which is a very popular routine in southern styles as its origins is linked to a famous patriot hero. The Mother &amp; Son Butterfly Swords () is also a primary weapon found in all Southern styles. Other weapons credited to having been taught in Wong Fei-hung curriculum were the Spring &amp; Autumn Guandao (), and the Yu Family Tiger Fork () broadsword (), the spear (), the fan (). Experiences of generations of practitioners has seen the curriculum grow extensively in all areas.

==Branches of Hung Kuen==
The curricula of different branches of Hung Ga differ tremendously with regard to routines and the selection of weapons, even within the Wong Fei-hung lineage.

Just as those branches that do not descend from Lam Sai-wing do not practice the Five Animal Five Element Fist. Those branches that do not descend from Wong Fei-hung, are sometimes called &quot;old Hung Kuen&quot; or &quot;village&quot; Hung Kuen, do not practice the routines he choreographed, nor do the branches that do not descend from Tit Kiu Saam practice Iron Wire. Conversely, the curricula of some branches have grown through the addition of further routines by creation or acquisition.

Nevertheless, the various branches of the Wong Fei-hung lineage still share the Hung Ga foundation he systematized. Lacking such a common point of reference, the &quot;village&quot; styles of Hung Kuen show even greater variation.

The curriculum which Jee Sin Sim See taught Hung Hei-gun is said to have comprised Tiger style, Luohan style, and Taming the Tiger routine. Exchanging material with other martial artists allowed Hung to develop or acquire Tiger Crane Paired Form routine, a combination animal routine, Southern Flower Fist, and several weapons.

According to Hung Ga tradition, the martial arts that Jee Sin Sim See originally taught Hung Hei-gun were short range and the more active footwork, wider stances, and long range techniques commonly associated with Hung Ga were added later. It is said to have featured &quot;a two-foot horse,&quot; that is, narrow stances, and routines whose footwork typically took up no more than four tiles&#x27; worth of space.

The Ha Sei Fu () is said to fit this description, though the implied link to the legendary Jee Sin Sim See is more speculative than most because of its poorly documented genealogy.
The Hasayfu Hung Kuen of Leung Wah-chew is a Five Animal style with a separate routine for each animal. Other Branches of Hasayfu Hung Kuen also contain combined animal sets, like Tiger &amp; Crane, Dragon &amp; Leopard, etc.

Five-Pattern Hung Kuen 五形洪拳
Similar to Ha Sei Fu Hung Ga, the Ng Ying Hung Kuen () fits the description of Jee Sin Sim See&#x27;s martial arts, but traces its ancestry to Ng Mui and Miu Hin () who, like Jee Sin Sim See, were both survivors of the destruction of the Shaolin Monastery.
From Miu Hin, the Five-Pattern Hung Kuen passed to his daughter Miu Tsui-fa (), and from his daughter to his grandson Fong Sai-yuk (), both Chinese folk heroes like Jee Sin Sim See, Ng Mui, and their forebear Miu Hin.
Yuen Yik-kai&#x27;s books introduced this branch to the Western world while conventionally translated as &quot;Five-Pattern Hung Fist&quot; rather than &quot;Five Animal Hung Fist&quot;, it is a Five-Animal style, one with a single routine for all Five Animals but also has other sets as well.

Tiger Crane Paired Form 虎鶴雙形
The Tiger-Crane Combination style has been found in almost every Hung style. While not as long as the Wong Fei-hung version, it is typically seen as containing 108 movements/techniques.

Ang Lian-huat attributes the art to Hung Hei-gun&#x27;s combination of the Tiger style he learned from Jee Sin Sim See with the Crane style he learned from his wife, whose name is given in Hokkien as Tee Eng-choon. Like other martial arts that trace their origins to Fujian (e.g. Fujian White Crane, Five Ancestors), this style uses San Chian as its foundation.

Wong Kiew-kit trace their version of the Tiger Crane routine, not to Hung Hei-gun or Luk Ah-choi, but to their senior classmate Harng Yein.

Northern Hung Kuen 洪拳
There are northern styles that use the name &quot;Hung Kuen&quot; (洪拳; pinyin: hóng quán), though these predate the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Other northern styles use the character for &quot;Red Fist&quot; ().

==The dissemination of Hung Kuen==

The dissemination of Hung Kuen in Southern China, and its Guangdong and Fujian Provinces in particular, is due to the concentration of anti-Qing activity there.
The Hung Mun began life in the 1760s as the Heaven and Earth Society, whose founders came from the prefecture of Zhangzhou in Fujian Province, on its border with Guangdong, where one of its founders organized a precursor to the Heaven and Earth Society in Huizhou.
Guangdong and Fujian remained a stronghold of sympathizers and recruits for the Hung Mun, even as it spread elsewhere in the decades that followed.
Though the members of the Hung Clan almost certainly practiced a variety of martial arts styles, the composition of its membership meant that it was the characteristics of Fujianese and Cantonese martial arts that came to be associated with the names &quot;Hung Kuen&quot; and &quot;Hung Ga&quot;.
Regardless of their differences, the Hung Kuen lineages of Wong Fei-hung, Yuen Yik-kai, Leung Wah-chew, and Jeung Kei-ji () nonetheless all trace their origins to this area and this time period, are all Five Animal styles, and all claim Shaolin origins.
Northern Hung Kuen (), by contrast, is not a Five Animal style and dates to the 16th century.
Cantonese and Fujianese are also predominant among Overseas Chinese, accounting for the widespread dissemination of Hung Kuen outside of China.

== Wong Fei-Hung lineages==

Lam Sai-wings Lineage mainly descends from Wong Fei-hung.

- Chan Hon-chung (), who was very famous in Hong Kong and represented what was best in his generation of masters. He held incredible knowledge and had the full Hung Kuen system passed down from Lam Sai-wing. In 1938, he established the Chan Hon Chung Gymnasium to teach Hung Gar (Hung Family) kung fu. At the same time he had a chiropractic clinic. In 1970, he formed The Hong Kong Chinese Martial Arts Association with the intention of coordinating and promoting Chinese martial arts in Hong Kong, and held the position of chairman for many years.

- Lau Jaam Hung Kuen (劉湛家傳) family lineage (Learn From Lam Sai-wing). One of the more famous teachers of Hung Kuen today was the Shaw Brothers movie director/actor, Lau Kar-leung (), who has many students in Hong Kong. One of Lau Kar-leung&#x27;s notable disciples is Mark Ho (Ho Mai, 何麥), also known as Mark Houghton, an Englishman who has lived in Hong Kong for 20 years. Mark Ho, with the blessing of Lau Kar-Leung, has opened a unique Hung Kuen school in Fanling. The school itself looks like a scene from a Shaw Brothers movie; it has many training chambers, wooden dummies, and hanging logs. There are now Lau Family Hung Kuen schools in China and England. Lau Kar-yung / Lau Ga-yung (劉家勇) He is the grandson of Lau Cham (劉湛) (Lau Jaam). Kar-yung is the son of Lau Cham&#x27;s (劉湛) second daughter Lau Shiu-yee and His uncle is Lau Kar-leung () and also he is Lau Kar-wing&#x27;s nephew. Kar-yung was followed by Lau Shiu-yee (Mother) to learn Lau&#x27;s Family Hung Ga kung fu and, Chinese herbal medicine at Lau Cham&#x27;s martial arts school in Hong Kong. Then he became a member of the Lau Kar Ban (Liu Jiaban) / Lau&#x27;s brothers and made some of the best Kung Fu movies ever seen. After 50 years of training and profession, he is currently the Grandmaster of Lau&#x27;s family Hung Kuen Branch and he continues spreading his family lineage across the globe. Also, become President of Hung Gar Association Lau Kar Yung Hung Kuen Kung Fu Association. Additional Lau family disciples were added for the 6th generation apprentice, representing Germany: Master Jau-chi Hang, Mexico: Master James Valentino Santi, and United States Lau Martial Club Hung Kuen Lion Dance Association: Master Chun Sun Ho(Chris Ho){son of Kar Yung}, Master Jaelynn Mae Ho {Daughter of Chun Sun} and Master Ken Chow ().

- Lam Cho () (Lam Sai-wing&#x27;s adopted nephew) was an icon in the Hong Kong martial arts scene. He succeeded in successful innovations and creative additions of various Hand and Weapon Routines. Lam Cho has taught many well known masters that now have students around the world. - Y.C. Wong () (San Francisco), Bucksam Kong () (Los Angeles and Hawaii), Kwong Tit-fu () and Tang Kwok-wah () (Boston) . Lam Cho&#x27;s children, Anthony Lam Chun-fai (), () and Lam Chun-sing (), now carry on his Hung Ga teaching in Hong Kong. Anthony Lam Chun-fai, his eldest son, has also done much to spread Hung Kuen in Europe, while Simon Lam Chun-chung, his third son, continues to teach his father&#x27;s students and new students at Lam Cho&#x27;s renowned studio in Mong Kok, Hong Kong.

(Among Tang Kwok-wah&#x27;s students currently teaching in the area are Winchell Ping Chiu-woo () (Chiu Mo Kwoon, Boston), Yon Lee () (who is also the master instructor for the Harvard Tai Chi Tiger Crane kung fu Club at Harvard University since 1985), and Sik Y. Hum. Calvin Chin of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts, carries on Kwong&#x27;s legacy.)

- Chiu Kau () began learning Hung Kuen in Singapore then became a student of Lam Sai-wing. He later married Wong Siu-ying (), who began learning Hung Ga from her husband. The couple eventually settled down in Hong Kong, where they continued their Hung Ga training at the Lam Sai-wing National Art Association Second Branch. Their sons Chiu Chi-ling () of Alameda, California, and Chiu Wai () of Calgary, Alberta, Canada are the inheritors of this lineage. Kwong-wing Lam (Lam Kwong-wing, 林光榮) of Sunnyvale, California, studied with Chiu Kau, Chiu Wai, and Lam Jo, and learned the Ha Sei Fu style of Hung Ga from Leung Wah-chew. In Hong Kong, the original Chiu Wai Hung Kuen school continues under the teaching of Chiu Wah (), and in 1996 another branch, Hung Kuen Academy Hong Kong, () was established in Hong Kong by Gam Bok-yin (), as its Founder, Chairman and Chief Instructor. Some years later Hung Kuen Academy Hong Kong appointed Chi Fai Leung (梁志輝) as Vice-Chairman and Senior Instructor, and Lam Siu Fung (林少峰) as Instructor. As of 2021, Chi Fai Leung (梁志輝) has founded a new branch in London, known as the Hung Kuen Academy UK, where he continues to teach traditional Hung Gar and lion dance, both of which are significant elements of the Chiu Wai lineage.

Dang Fong () lineage students consists of such notables as: Ho Lap Tien - Represented in the U.S. by Philadelphia&#x27;s Master Cheurng Shu Pui.(), Yuen Ling - Represented in the U.S. by Master Frank Yee (; Yee Chi-wai), Lau Kai Ton - Represented in the U.S. by New Mexico&#x27;s Master Frank Rivera., Luk Gan Wing - Represented in Ontario, Canada by his son., Cheung Tai Hing - Represented in the U.S. by New York&#x27;s Master Wan Chi Ming., Jao/Chow Wing Duk - Represented in Spain by Master Lam Chuen Ping, Wong Jo, Kwan Kei Tin &amp; Won Lei

<text>Dirk Hartog (; baptised 30 October 1580 – buried 11 October 1621) was a 17th-century Dutch sailor and explorer. Dirk Hartog&#x27;s expedition was the second European group to land in Australia and the first to leave behind an artifact to record his visit, the Hartog Plate. His name is sometimes alternatively spelled Dirck Hartog or Dierick Hartochsz. Ernest Giles referred to him as Theodoric Hartog. The Western Australian island Dirk Hartog Island is named after Hartog.

== Life ==

Born into a seafaring family, he received his first ship&#x27;s command at the age of 30 and spent several years engaged in successful trading ventures in the Baltic and Mediterranean seas.

In 1616, Hartog gained employment with the Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated to VOC), and was appointed master of the (meaning &quot;Concord&quot; or &quot;Unity&quot;), in a fleet voyaging from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies.

Hartog set sail in January 1616 in the company of several other VOC ships, but became separated from them in a storm, and arrived independently at the Cape of Good Hope (later to become the site of Cape Town, South Africa). Hartog then set off across the Indian Ocean for Batavia (present-day Jakarta), utilising (or perhaps blown off course by) the strong westerly winds known as the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; which had been noted earlier by the Dutch navigator Hendrik Brouwer as enabling a quicker route to Java.

On 25 October 1616, at approximately 26° latitude south, Hartog and crew came unexpectedly upon &quot;various islands, which were, however, found uninhabited.&quot;He made landfall at an island off the coast of Shark Bay, Western Australia, which is now called Dirk Hartog Island after him. His was the second recorded European expedition to land on the Australian continent, having been preceded by Willem Janszoon in 1606, but the first to do so on the western coastline. 

Hartog spent three days examining the coast and nearby islands. The area was named &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot; after his ship, although that name has not endured. Before Hartog left, he affixed a pewter plate to a post, now known as the Hartog plate, on which he scratched a record of his visit to the island. Its inscription (translated from the original Dutch) read:

:&quot;1616 On 25 October arrived the ship Eendracht, of Amsterdam: Supercargo Gilles Miebais of Liege, skipper Dirch Hatichs of Amsterdam. on 27 d[itt]o. she set sail again for Bantam. Deputy supercargo Jan Stins, upper steersman Pieter Doores of Bil. In the year 1616.&quot;

Finding nothing of interest, Hartog continued sailing northwards along this previously uncharted coastline of Western Australia, making nautical charts up to about 22° latitude south. He then left the coast and continued on to Batavia, eventually arriving safely in December 1616, some five months after his expected arrival.

Dirk Hartog left the employ of the VOC upon his return to Amsterdam in 1618, resuming private trading ventures in the Baltic.

==Postscript==
In 1619 Frederik de Houtman, in the VOC ship , and Jacob d&#x27;Edel, in another VOC ship , sighted land on the Australian coast near present-day Perth which they called &quot;d&#x27;Edelsland&quot;. After sailing northwards along the coast they made landfall in &quot;Eendrachtsland&quot;. In his journal, Houtman identified these coasts with Marco Polo&#x27;s land of Beach, or Locach, as shown on maps of the time such as that of Petrus Plancius and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten.

Eighty years later, on 4 February 1697, the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh landed on the island and by chance found the Hartog plate, which lay half-buried in sand. He replaced it with a new plate which reproduced Hartog&#x27;s original inscription and added notes of his own, and took Hartog&#x27;s original back to Amsterdam, where it is housed in the Rijksmuseum.

In 2000 the Hartog plate was temporarily returned to Australia as part of an exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney. This led to suggestions that the plate, considered important as the oldest-known written artefact from Australia&#x27;s European history, should be acquired for an Australian museum, but the Dutch authorities have made it clear that the plate is not for sale.

In 1966 and 1985 Hartog was depicted on Australian postage stamps, both depicting his ship. In 2016 the Perth Mint issued a silver coin to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Hartog&#x27;s Australian landfall.

The island in Shark Bay, Western Australia, where he made landfall was named Dirk Hartog Island. In Amsterdam, Canberra and fourteen other Australian towns, streets have been named in his honour.

<text>Dirk Hartog Island is an island off the Gascoyne coast of Western Australia, within the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. It is about long and between wide and is Western Australia&#x27;s largest and westernmost island. It covers an area of and is approximately north of Perth.

Known as by the traditional custodians of the island, the Malgana people, the island is named after Dirk Hartog, a Dutch sea captain, whose ship first encountered the Western Australian coastline in 1616, close to the 26th parallel south latitude, which runs through the island. After leaving the island, Hartog continued his voyage north-east along the coast, giving the Australian mainland one of its earliest known names, Eendrachtsland, which he named after his ship &quot;Eendracht&quot;, meaning &quot;concord&quot;.

The island is now the site of a major environmental reconstruction project, &quot;Return to 1616&quot;, that has seen all introduced livestock and feral animals removed, and eleven native species in various stages of reintroduction.

==History==

The first Europeans known to have sighted the island were the crew of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) ship &quot;Eendracht&quot;, captained by Hartog, on 25 October 1616, during a voyage from Cape Town to Batavia (now Jakarta). The date, and the names of the senior people on the vessel, were inscribed on a pewter plate and nailed to a post.

In 1697, Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh landed on the island and found Hartog&#x27;s plate. He replaced it with one of his own, which included a copy of Hartog&#x27;s inscription, and took the original plate home to Amsterdam, where it is still kept in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

On 28 March 1772, Breton navigator Louis Aleno de St Aloüarn landed on the island and became the first European to formally take possession of Western Australia in the name of the French king Louis XV. That involved a ceremony on 30 March, during which one or more bottles were buried on the island. One bottle was recorded as containing an annexation document and a coin. In 1998 a bottle cap made of lead with an écu coin set in it was found at Turtle Bay by a team led by Philippe Godard and Max Cramer. That triggered a broader search by a team from the Western Australian Museum, led by Myra Stanbury, with Bob Sheppard, Bob Creasy and Dr Michael McCarthy. On 1 April 1998, an intact bottle was unearthed, with a lead cap identical to the one recovered earlier, and also with a coin set in it. No trace of an annexation document has yet been found.

In 1801, the island was visited by the &quot;Naturaliste&quot;, under captain Emmanuel Hamelin, which was part of the Baudin expedition to Australia. They found de Vlamingh&#x27;s plate almost buried in the sand, its post having rotted away. Hamelin ordered that it be re-erected in its original position. In 1818, the &quot;Uranie&quot;, captained by French explorer Louis de Freycinet, who had been an officer in Hamelin&#x27;s 1801 crew, sent a boat ashore to recover de Vlamingh&#x27;s plate. It eventually arrived in Paris, only to be lost for over a century. It was found in 1940 and returned to Australia in 1947, where it can now be seen in the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western Australia.

In 1869, Francis Louis von Bibra (son of Franz Ludwig von Bibra) was granted a lease to the island. Von Bibra grazed sheep there and traded guano from its bays.

In 1907, the leasehold on the island was acquired from Messrs Moore and Meade by the Withnell brothers. It was regarded as an ideal place for a sheep station as there was no danger of rabbit invasion. In 1909, it was carrying a flock of about 12,000 sheep and produced approximately 400 bales of wool. The property was then owned by John and James Withnell, the children of John and Emma Withnell who had been early settlers in the Pilbara. The brothers estimated the area of the island to be and intended to increase the flock on the island to 25,000. By 1910 the flock size was 14,200.

By 1919, the pastoral lease was put up for auction by the owner James Nicholas, who also owned Croydon and Peron Peninsula Stations. The station occupied an area of and was stocked with approximately 19,000 sheep.

Perth Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Wardle purchased the island as a private retreat for his family in about 1969 and later retired there, becoming a semi-recluse with his wife. With the exception of the pastoral homestead, the island later returned to government ownership and became part of the Shark Bay Marine Park. The homestead is now run as an eco-tourism resort and maintained by Wardle&#x27;s grandson, Kieran Wardle.

On 16 March 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the wreck of the World War II German raider &quot;Kormoran&quot; had been found on the seabed about west of the island.

==Geography ==
The northerly most point Cape Inscription is the location of the plates and the main lighthouse.

The bay facing north next to Cape Inscription is known as Turtle Bay.

The most south westerly point – Surf Point – is located at the channel known as South Passage across from Steep Point on its south west side.

===Land use ===
The island consists mostly of scrub-covered sand dunes. At times it has been used as a sheep station and supported 20,000 head of sheep at one stage. The island is now Dirk Hartog Island National Park and sheep have been removed. To the east it is bounded by the Shark Bay Marine Park, and it is part of Shark Bay World Heritage Area. A small area is leased to the Wardle family who runs it as a tourism destination. The region is widely used for recreational fishing.

==Wildlife and conservation ==
Dirk Hartog Island is an important nesting site for loggerhead sea turtle, with green turtles and loggerhead turtles both nesting on the beaches. It is also home for the endemic subspecies of the white-winged fairy-wren. Quoin Bluff, mid-way along the eastern side of the island, holds an important pied cormorant nesting colony which, along with Freycinet Island some to the south-east, forms the Quoin Bluff and Freycinet Island Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International.

In October 2018, at the end of a 20-year project, the island was declared free of feral cats, goats and sheep, paving the way for the reintroduction of 11 native animals, most of which had disappeared following a century and a half of pastoral activity and predation.

The &quot;Return to 1616&quot; environmental reconstruction project involves returning nine native species confirmed to have once been present on the island: the western barred bandicoot, burrowing bettong, Shark Bay mouse, greater stick-nest rat, western thick-billed grasswren, brush-trailed bettong, heath mouse, desert mouse, brush-tailed mulgara, dibbler and chuditch. Two additional mammal species that are thought likely to have once been present on the island, the rufous hare-wallaby and banded hare-wallaby, are also included in the faunal reconstruction, and were the first to be returned following the eradication of feral cats in September 2017.

The western barred bandicoot and the dibbler were returned in October 2019. The Shark Bay mouse and the greater stick-nest rat were reintroduced to the island in April and May 2021, respectively, with early monitoring suggesting ongoing survival. The western thick-billed grasswren was returned in October 2022, with 85 birds translocated to the island from two distinct mainland populations at Shark Bay.

Proof that dibblers were reproducing on the island was established in June 2021. By November 2022, all six reintroduced mammal species were described as breeding and establishing new territories on the island.

One hundred brush-tailed mulgaras were reintroduced to the island from Matuwa Kurrara Kurrara National Park in the Western Australian Goldfields, in June 2023. The population is hoped to expand to 3000 individuals.

<text>The Subaru Outback is an automotive nameplate used by the Japanese automaker Subaru for two different SUV-themed vehicles: a Legacy-derived crossover station wagon, the Outback (1994–present, also sold as in some markets), and an Impreza-derived off-road themed hatchback, the Outback Sport (1994–2011).

Most versions of the Outback wagon and Outback Sport have had all-wheel drive as standard equipment.

==History==

The original Outback station wagon was derived from the wagon variant of the second-generation Subaru Legacy. The first-generation Legacy, which made its debut in 1989, did not receive the cosmetic and suspension modifications to create an Outback version, although Subaru offered an Outdoor option package for the 1994 model year Legacy L all-wheel drive model, which added a compressed air strut height adjustable suspension, a luggage rack, a skidplate, and mud flaps.

Earlier, a raised-roof &quot;Touring Wagon&quot; variant had been offered on the preceding Subaru Leone for the 1988 and 1989 model years. Subaru also sold a raised-roof variant (chassis code BF) of the first-generation Legacy wagon outside the United States. North American Legacy wagons were only offered as the flat-roof variant (chassis code BJ) until a special &quot;GT&quot; model was marketed for the 1994 model year.

The second-generation Legacy wagon became the first generation of the Outback crossover series, called the &quot;Legacy Grand Wagon&quot; in Japan in 1995, and the &quot;Legacy Outback&quot; in most other markets. Compared to the existing Legacy wagon, the &quot;Outback&quot; variant added partial protective plastic side body cladding for off-road conditions, used a raised roof, and would later raise the suspension to provide additional ground clearance. It was introduced at the 1994 New York Auto Show. Aside from other small differences in trim, the Outback shares almost all of its components with the Legacy donor model.

When launched in Australia in 1996, the name &quot;Legacy Outback&quot; was shortened to &quot;Outback&quot;, followed in other markets afterwards. In the United States, Subaru also retailed the Legacy SUS sedan between the 1997 and 2007 model years, with similar modifications to distinguish it from the equivalent Legacy model sedan. The Impreza Outback Sport was introduced at the 1996 New York Auto Show, but for the 1997 model year, the donor model names were dropped, and the cars were known as the &quot;Outback&quot; and &quot;Outback Sport&quot;.

== First generation (BD/BG/BK; 1994)==
The Outback concept originated with Subaru of America, which was suffering from slumping sales in the mid-1990s partly due to a lack of an entry in the then-burgeoning sport utility vehicle market. Lacking the finances to design an all-new vehicle, Subaru decided to add body cladding and a suspension lift to their Legacy wagon. Named the Legacy Outback, after the Australian outback, actor Paul Hogan was the spokesman in the North American market, playing off the Australian name of the vehicle and portraying the vehicle as a capable and more efficient alternative to large, truck-based SUVs. Sales exceeded expectations, with Tim Mahoney, Senior Vice President of Subaru of America stating &quot;[the Outback] saved our company.&quot;

From the beginning, the new model was known in Australia as the Outback and in Japan starting August 1995 as the Legacy Grand Wagon; the &quot;Grand Wagon&quot; nomenclature was meant to signify a more grand, luxurious vehicle compared to the standard Japanese model, which at that time was known as the Legacy Touring Wagon. 

The Legacy Outback was formally introduced to the North American market at the 1994 New York Auto Show for the 1995 model year. Initially, the Outback was a trim package on the base-model Legacy L wagon, which meant that its standard equipment list included heavy cloth interior, Berber carpet floor mats, and a luggage rack, among other features. This approach was also used on the smaller Impreza wagon, with the name Outback Sport. 

The debut Outback retained the ground clearance of the standard Legacy wagon but differentiated itself visually with details like a two-tone paint job and fog lights, which helped suggest a more rugged aesthetic. The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis.

When the 1996 model year arrived, it gained more aggressive appearing front bumper covers, with larger rallye-inspired driving lamps replacing the previously installed fog lights, taller tires with more aggressive tread, and a ground clearance, with a ground clearance in Japan. The more aggressive appearance was also used on the smaller Outback Sport while omitting the increase in ground clearance from suspension modification. This approach was inspired by the Legacy having been entered into international rallying and long distance racing events, and winning the 1990 Safari Rally in the Group N category. In 1996, the MY1997 Outback received the hood scoop (bonnet) but no accompanying performance modifications commonly suggested by such a design feature.

The previous generation Legacy wagon had an optional air suspension, which allowed the driver to temporarily increase the vehicle&#x27;s ground clearance, however the permanent increased ride height used on the Outback proved to be more practical. Subaru sales had been declining up until that point in North American market. With the help of clever marketing, a trim level called the Outback intent on making the Subaru a more capable multi-terrain vehicle offered an affordable and fuel efficient alternative to the popular SUVs that were outselling Subaru&#x27;s traditional offerings. The Legacy and Outback wagons were built at the Subaru of Indiana Automotive production facility in Lafayette, Indiana that also manufactured the Isuzu Rodeo and the badge engineered Honda Passport, traditional SUVs with a transfer case, four-wheel-drive and an extended ground clearance.

In September 1997, the Japanese Legacy Grand Wagon was renamed Legacy Lancaster though 1998 cars retained the Grand Wagon nameplate along with the new Lancaster plate. Earlier versions of the Outback continued to use the EJ22 four cylinder engine, while later generations introduced the larger EJ25 four cylinder engine, revised with DOHC and more horsepower. The JDM Grand Wagon and Lancaster were only available with the DOHC 2.5-litre flat-4 engine, receiving a improvement in 1998. Some Japanese-spec Grand Wagons came with digital climate control, plaid seat upholstery, a dual-range manual transmission and a Momo black leather steering wheel.

All trim levels retained the typical AWD layouts seen in previous generation Legacy, depending on transmission choice. Manual transmission models came with a mechanical &quot;Continuous AWD&quot; system which was normally 50/50 front/rear, and relied on limited slip differentials to redirect power front to rear, rear to front, and from one rear wheel to the other (when fitted with a rear limited slip differential). – No USA Legacy models had front or rear limited slip differential from &#x27;92–99 – including Outback versions. Automatic transmission models had an electronically controlled AWD system that was 90/10 front/rear and redirected differing amounts of power to the rear wheels continuously. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle&#x27;s weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or &quot;1st&quot; gear, the transmission divides the torque 50–50 to both front and rear wheels.

===Legacy SUS===
The Legacy SUS (short for &quot;Sport Utility Sedan&quot;) was launched with a limited production test run sold in USA in 1998 and, based on its success, was rolled out in North America only the following year. The &quot;Limited&quot; trim level package for the Outback wagon was standard equipment on the sedan body, with the addition of a hood scoop and trunk-mounted rear wing. Despite the appearance of the front hood scoop, the SUS was not installed with a turbocharged engine; the only engine installed from Subaru was the naturally-aspirated EJ25D engine. The &quot;SUS&quot; moniker was removed with the introduction of the second generation Outback Sedan. Plastic side cladding was not present on the side doors of the Outback; the lower half of the doors were painted a contrasting color also found on the front and rear bumper covers.

== Second generation (BE/BH; 1999)==
With the arrival of the third generation Legacy, the second generation Outback wagon became its own model. The Legacy SUS remained unique to North America and was realigned with the Outback Limited package, offering the sedan with an optional horizontal six-cylinder engine, also optional on the wagon. The new body style was introduced to Japan in September 1998 and called the Lancaster. The USA-spec Outback was available starting in 2000. In October of that year, Nissan introduced a Japan-only called competitor with an Outback-like appearance called the Nissan Avenir Blaster.

The raised roof was retained, but the new body was smoother, rounder, and about 3 inches longer, with a slightly longer wheelbase. A new version of Subaru&#x27;s flat four-cylinder &quot;boxer&quot; engine was standard, offering more low-end torque, better fuel economy, and smoother performance. There were no changes to the front suspension, but there was a complete makeover of the rear suspension, which included a new design that occupied less of the backspace, adding more room in the trunk and cargo floor. Safety improvements consist of three-point seat belts for the driver and additional four passengers. There is also a child-safety-seat anchor for all of the seat positions in the back. For the front, the seat belts are positioned to better hold the driver and front passenger along with front and rear airbags installed to protect the occupants in a collision. The Subaru Outback received a good rating from The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2000 for its performance in a safety demonstration of a crash test at 40 miles per hour. The Outback has been since developing to make it as safe, smooth, and convenient a ride that it can be.

The rear seat on the Outback sedan does not fold down, unlike previous generations where the rear seat had a 60:40 folding seat for extended length items. Rear headrests are now included as standard equipment on all trim levels. The ground clearance is . The engine now meets California&#x27;s LEV emission standard.

The Outback came standard with a by SAE, 4-cylinder boxer engine, four-cylinder SOHC design with a maximum torque of () that was available at a lower RPM compared to the previous generation. The 2.5 L SOHC four-cylinder engine uses a timing belt that must be replaced around , whereas the 3.0 L six-cylinder engine uses a timing chain that does not require replacement under normal conditions.

The base model six-cylinder was offered as the H6-3.0 — its interior, and available options, were identical to those of the Outback &quot;Limited&quot;, with the exception of a manual transmission, although many successful non-factory transmission swaps have proven that it physically bolts up without issue (but still requires some significant modifications to the electrical system). Badging for all 6-cylinder Outbacks was located on the front grille as well as on the rear of the vehicle.

In a higher trim level, known as the Outback H6-3.0 L.L. Bean in the USA, it included standard features like an in-dash six-disc CD changer, automatic climate control, leather upholstery, and dual moonroofs. OnStar was available as an option on the USA-spec L.L. Bean and VDC trims. In-dash satellite navigation was offered on Japan-spec vehicles on upper trim level wagons starting with Model Year 1998 and continued to offer a Momo black leather steering wheel with genuine wood inlay, shift knob, and parking brake handle. Plaid upholstery was still offered on Japan-spec Lancasters.

The six-cylinder was also available as the Outback H6-3.0 VDC; a 200 Watt McIntosh stereo system was standard from 2001 to 2004 with Subaru&#x27;s VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system, which integrated stability control with traction control. These were some of the only vehicles ever factory-equipped with McIntosh stereo equipment. The system was also mated to a previously used Japanese-market AWD system, called VTD, in which power was split 45/55 front-to-rear in normal conditions. When wheel spin is detected, the system cuts power to the spinning wheel and directs power to those that are not. Only when necessary do the brakes slow the affected wheels, when the vehicle detects excessive oversteer or understeer. This package had more sound insulation than other trims, as well as those features found on the H6-3.0 L.L. Bean, such as dual moonroofs, OnStar, and leather upholstery. Its curb weight was just slightly higher than that of the standard H6-3.0 L.L. Bean trim, and while the VDC badging was placed on the front quarter panels only, the H6-3.0 and Outback markings were also applied as usual.

=== Australia ===


Australian-specification vehicles differ from cars delivered in the United States by following the Japanese models; primarily headlights, side indicators (on front quarter panels), rear taillights, front and rear bumpers, and a higher placing of the &quot;Outback&quot; badging on the front door bodywork (as opposed to being placed on the plastic cladding).

This generation of Outback was released in an early style with gold-colored cladding, all-in-one headlights (not dissimilar to the US model headlights), and internally a light gray cloth (sometimes speckled with various colors), a light brown wood textured dashboard and a plain instrument cluster. A nudge bar (a smaller style of bullbar or roo bar) was also available as an aftermarket option. The later style (2002–2004) was updated with silver cladding, an updated range of paint colors, multi-unit headlights (where headlight and indicators were in different sections of the unit) and internally a dark gray/black cloth, dark gray plastics, a very dark brown faint wood texture, and metal trims on the dials of the instrument cluster.

Models available included the base &quot;Outback&quot;, the &quot;Outback Limited&quot; which added a sunroof and cloth/leather seats and the &quot;Outback H6&quot; which included the 6-cylinder engine with VDC as described in this article. The H6 was released with slightly different 16-inch wheels and available in a single metallic pearl off-white color instead of the usual color with gold or silver cladding. The H6 was only available in automatic, apparently due to the size of the 6-cylinder engine taking up too much space to fit the manual box and associated dual-range mechanicals.

=== Japan ===
The Lancaster (as known in Japan) was released originally in September 1998 following the original release of the third-generation Legacy in May 1998. The Lancaster models were available originally in 2.5 L engine size with the E-4AT transmission or 5-Speed Manual Car. In May 2000, Subaru released the Lancaster 6, featuring Subaru&#x27;s reborn Flat-6 engine. This was in production from April 2000 to May 2001 when Subaru released the facelifted Legacy models included a revised Lancaster design. These changes were seen on &#x27;Outbacks&#x27; produced in Japan, US built Outbacks did not use the facelifted design released by Subaru Japan.

The Lancaster ADA (Active Driving Assist) was introduced in September 1999. The system featured two CCD cameras mounted either side of the rear-view mirror. The system was installed on 2.5 L models with VDC and then later in 2000 on the newer Lancaster 6 VDC models.

The ADA system featured 4 key safety components:
While Subaru&#x27;s newly marketed :ja:EyeSight (Japanese) system (essentially ADA) found in the 5th generation Legacy and Outback draws media attention for &#x27;new advanced technology&#x27;, the ADA system was actually a system developed back in the late 1990s along with the development of the 3rd Generation Legacy and is no means &#x27;new technology&#x27; as such, but more a &#x27;newly recognised&#x27; system for a more safety-conscious global market.
== Third generation (BL/BP; 2003)==


On October 22, 2003, with the debut of the third-generation Legacy at the 60th Frankfurt Auto Show, the Outback name was now being used in all markets with the launch of the third-generation Outback crossover, which until that point had only been used in export markets. Models equipped with a 3.0L EZ30D H6 were introduced at the 2004 Chicago Auto Show. The ground clearance is in the US, so as to get around fuel economy regulations, and most elsewhere. In some countries, such as Canada, it varied by what engine was installed.

This generation of Outback carried the same model codes as the Legacy Wagon: BP9 for the 2.5-litre model and BPE for the 3.0-litre model. The highest trim level offered in the United States was the Outback &quot;L.L. Bean Edition&quot; that offered optional equipment as standard, including a wood and leather steering wheel, an auxiliary port on the stereo for external music player compatibility (2007 and later), perforated leather seats, GPS navigation, a double-sized, one-piece glass moonroof, limited-slip differential, and the 3.0-litre H6 engine. Starting with this generation, the interior retractable rear cargo cover had a separate stowage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover could be removed for large items and stowed out of the way inside the vehicle.

A new Outback variant for the 2005 and newer years was the Outback XT. This model came with the same turbocharged 2.5L EJ255 4-cylinder engine found in the Impreza WRX model. This engine produced , which was much higher than the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine, which produced . The XT model came equipped with any 2 of the 3 standard transmissions: a 5-speed Auto-SportShift, or a 5-speed manual.

In 2007, the Outback (along with the Ford Mondeo) won &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Car of the Year&quot; award.

As of the 2008 model year, the Legacy wagon and Outback sedan were discontinued in the United States, leaving only the Legacy sedan and Outback crossover models. The Outback crossover also received styling revisions for the 2008 model year, most notably an enlarged, chrome-ringed grille. Additionally, in July, 2008 Subaru ceased offering a special edition L.L. Bean trim level on the Outback.

For 2008, the 2.5i USA model was certified PZEV emissions and a &quot;PZEV&quot; badge attached to the rear of the vehicle on the bottom right hand side of the tailgate. All other models were certified LEV2. The PZEV Outback was available for sale in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers, who usually only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.

===EyeSight===
Starting May 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy could be fitted with a new safety feature called EyeSight. It consists of two cameras, one on each side of the rear-view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system helps maintain a safe distance on the highway, warns the driver during unintended lane departure, emits a wake up call should everyone else pull away from the traffic lights, and keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.

===Diesel===
The Subaru EE series flat-4 diesel engine was offered in both Legacy and Outback models in Europe exclusively. These diesel models were introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March, 2008. Identified as the &quot;Subaru Outback 2.0D&quot;, it was offered with a 5-speed manual transmission only. The top-of-the-line JDM and EU diesel models also had a &quot;Start/Stop&quot; button, similar to those found in Lexus, Infiniti, Audi and other high end makers.

According to the Subaru Owners on-line newsletter dated March 2008, Subaru was planning to introduce the diesel Legacy and Outback models in the U.S., stating they were &quot;...currently making modifications to the diesel so it meets the more stringent U.S. standards. Subaru diesel models should be domestically available in two to three years.&quot; However, there has yet to be a diesel version of any Subaru model introduced into the U.S.

== Fourth generation (BR/BM; 2009)==


Based on the fifth generation Legacy, the fourth generation Subaru Outback was introduced in April 2009 at the New York Auto Show, the fifteenth anniversary of the first Outback&#x27;s introduction at the same event. The Outback was introduced in Japan May 20, 2009. The &quot;Legacy&quot; prefix has been dropped internationally. Air Bags are offered for the driver and front passenger, side bolster airbags for front seats on the outer edge, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers and a knee bolster air bag for the driver.

The ground clearance increases to , and is the ninth Subaru vehicle to feature continuously variable transmission (CVT). The double-sized moonroof is no longer being offered, and has been reduced to a conventional size that doesn&#x27;t extend over the rear seats. The turbocharged engine is also no longer offered on all international versions of the Outback. An engine coolant temperature gauge is no longer offered, replaced by a fuel economy gauge instead. When the engine temperature is below normal, an indicator light shines blue and when the engine is overheating, the light turns red. Using the key to unlock the drivers&#x27; door after locking the vehicle with the remote will set off the security system; the vehicle must be unlocked with the remote, a tradition going back to the first generation when remote keyless access was introduced.

The side windows are no longer frameless, ending a Subaru tradition started with the first generation Leone in the early 1970s. The &quot;D&quot; pillar on the crossover is no longer covered in glass, also ending a design tradition established with the first generation and borrowed from the Subaru XT. The front and rear bumper covers are no longer painted a contrasting color, but the plastic side body cladding continues. The external &quot;Limited&quot; badge has been retired on North American vehicles, and if the vehicle has the 3.6 L six-cylinder engine, the rear of the vehicle has a &quot;3.6R&quot; badge applied internationally. Black housing for headlights is not offered on the Outback worldwide. The Outback with 2.0 L diesel engine can be distinguished by its hood scoop and &quot;Boxer Diesel&quot; emblem on the rear. January 21, 2010, the Outback was introduced for sale in South Korea.

Subaru introduced improvements to the chassis that they call Dynamic Chassis Control Concept, which uses high-tensile steel in critical areas to achieve high strength with lighter weight. The front-end structure introduces Cradle Mount that isolates the suspension and engine from the passenger compartment for a smoother and quieter ride using rubber mounts. New for this generation is a double wishbone rear suspension, with all suspension links and the rear differential isolated from the rear subframe with large rubber mounts to minimize noise and vibration intruding into the passenger compartment. Subaru has also added safety technologies such as Electronic Stability Control, Brake Assist, and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution to the list of standard features.

In North America, the fourth generation Outback won Motor Trend&#x27;s Sport/Utility of the Year Award for 2010, and Ward&#x27;s Automotive Group&#x27;s 2010 Interior of the Year awards in the popular-priced car category under $29,999.

===North American models===
Trim level designations have been modified based on the engine installed; the Subaru EJ engine 2.5 L naturally aspirated engine are labeled 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, and 2.5i Limited, with the Subaru EZ 6-cylinder engine identified as 3.6R, 3.6R Premium and 3.6R Limited. As with previous generations, leather interior is only available in 2 colors (Warm Ivory or Off-Black) on Limited trim packages on specific exterior colors, and a glass moonroof is optional only on the Limited; cloth interiors are offered in the specified colors on lower trim level packages. A 440 W, 9-speaker Harman/Kardon audio system, using Dolby Pro Logic II technology and DTS Digital Sound, with Bluetooth and iPod capability is optional on the Limited trim packages. An voice activated GPS touch screen navigation system is optional only on the Limited. A separate Bluetooth wireless package with voice recognition, called Blueconnect, is available on lower trim levels and is not offered internationally. A Harman/Kardon-sourced stereo with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and SRS Circle Surround sound is the standard sound system provided, with four speakers on all trim levels. A dual zone digital climate control system with 6-speed fan is standard and only available on the Limited; the base and Premium model have a 4-speed fan. Base and Premium trim levels have silver metallic trim on the interior door panels and dashboard; the Limited trim package has woodgrain accents.

All trim levels are fitted with a retractable roof installed luggage rack, where the crossmembers are permanently attached but can be swung into the luggage carrier support structure when not in use, currently available only on North American models. Also, the North American Outback has lower side body claddings, which are not applied to international models (although the cladding may come on international models as a dealer-installed option). The interior retractable rear cargo cover has a separate storage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the cargo cover can be removed for large items but stored inside the vehicle and out of the way. The rear seatbacks can be partially reclined for comfort.
* The 2010 model year had eight exterior colors: Azurite Blue Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Harvest Gold Metallic, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic, Steel Silver Metallic.
* The 2011 model year had nine exterior colors: Azurite Blue Pearl, Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ruby Red Pearl, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic, Steel Silver Metallic. The exterior color Harvest Gold Metallic was removed for the 2011 model year. The exterior colors Caramel Bronze Pearl and Ruby Red Pearl were added for the 2011 model year.
* The 2012 model year had nine exterior colors: Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Deep Indigo Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ice Silver Metallic, Ruby Red Pearl, Satin White Pearl, Sky Blue Metallic. The exterior colors Azurite Blue Pearl and Steel Silver Metallic were removed for the 2012 model year. The exterior colors Deep Indigo Pearl and Ice Silver Metallic were added for the 2012 model year.
* The 2013 model year had ten exterior colors: Brilliant Brown Pearl (available for a limited time, in a Special Appearance Package only), Caramel Bronze Pearl, Crystal Black Silica, Cypress Green Pearl, Deep Indigo Pearl, Graphite Gray Metallic, Ice Silver Metallic, Satin White Pearl, Twilight Blue Metallic, and Venetian Red Pearl. The exterior colors Ruby Red Pearl and Sky Blue Metallic were removed for the 2013 model year. The exterior colors Twilight Blue Metallic and Venetian Red Pearl were added for the 2013 model year.

All models are now available with painted exterior door handles, with black exterior side mirrors on the base level 2.5i, and painted mirrors on Premium and Limited. The Limited can be identified externally by simulated aluminium surround for the front foglights and matching trim piece on the bottom edges of the side door sill protector, front, and rear bumpers; the Premium and base model remain black. The grille appearance is unique on North American models so as to provide a visual similarity to the larger facelifted Tribeca and the third generation Forester. The 2.5i uses the flat-4 engine with 6-speed manual transmission or the optional Lineartronic Continuously variable transmission with steering column-mounted paddle shifters that allows the driver to select 6 &quot;virtual gears&quot; in manual mode. The 3.6R uses the flat-6 engine (from the Subaru Tribeca) exclusively with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The conventional automatic transmission is only available with the flat-6 engine, and the 6-speed manual transmission is not available on the 2.5i Limited. The PZEV Outback 2.5i, identified by a badge attached to the rear of the vehicle, continues to be sold in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers who only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.

===Japanese models===
The Japanese-specification Outback is available with either the 2.5 L flat-4 or the 3.6 L flat-6 engine. The EJ20 engine is no longer used in the Legacy or the Legacy Outback. The trim levels are 2.5i, 2.5i L package and 3.6R and 3.6R SI-Cruise. &quot;SI-Cruise&quot; is an autonomous cruise control system that can reduce or resume a preset speed or bring the vehicle to a complete stop if the system detects a slower vehicle is being followed, without driver intervention. Air vents are installed for rear passengers at the back of the center front armrest compartment. The front hood (bonnet) and front bumper covers are not interchangeable with the North American version due to slight changes in the sheet metal.
Turn signal repeaters are still integrated into the side exterior mirrors on all Japanese-spec models. Woodgrain accents are standard on the &quot;L&quot; package and the SI-Cruise vehicle, silver accents on lower trim levels.
SI-Drive, or Subaru Intelligent-Drive, () is standard equipment on all trim versions. It is a feature that enables three distinctly different modes of vehicle performance characteristics (identified as &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Sport Sharp&quot;, and &quot;Intelligent&quot;) by regulating the engine control unit (ECU), the automatic transmission control unit (TCU, if equipped), and by fine-tuning the electronically controlled throttle. The SI-Drive control knob is installed on the center console between the heated front seat control switches. The &quot;Intelligent&quot; mode makes throttle response more gradual, and decreases maximum engine power by 10 percent. The &quot;Sport&quot; mode allows the engine to run at higher speeds and increases fuel efficiency by 5 percent in comparison to Subaru engines without the feature. The &quot;Sport # (Sharp)&quot; mode makes throttle response more abrupt and enables the automatic transmission to maintain higher RPMs within a given gear&#x27;s range, and minimizes the electric power steering wheel effort. When the engine is started, the default setting is the &quot;Sport&quot; selection.

Japanese buyers can choose two different premium level entertainment systems; they can select the previously described Harman/Kardon GPS-stereo with six speakers, or a McIntosh sourced GPS/stereo with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, a separate powered amplifier and 10 speakers. Both units are Gracenote, G-BOOK and VICS enabled, with both systems available with an internal 600 MHz 40GB HDD coupled with a digital TV tuner that can be watched when the transmission is in park and the parking brake applied. Both stereos are compatible with CD, CD-R/RW, DVD and DVD R/RW as well as MP3 and WMA music formats. A Harman/Kardon sourced stereo with a 6-disc in-dash CD changer and SRS Circle Surround sound is the entry level sound system offered with six speakers and is standard equipment. The McIntosh stereo facia is offered in the trademark black with a clear plastic overlay and the center dashboard trim piece retains the brushed aluminum appearance but the color is black, with the climate controls offered in a matching black appearance, instead of the standard silver. Oddly, the Japanese version has a retractable cover for the console installed cupholders, whereas the North American version has exposed cupholders without a retractable cover. The dual-zone climate control system is standard on all trim levels.

The GPS navigation system can be displayed in a split-screen format showing both two- and three dimensions with graphic landmarks instead of a flat screen without geographical images. HID headlights are standard on all models except the base 2.5i, as well as automatic rain sensing windshield wipers and headlight washers. A smart key is available as an option coupled with two position memory seat that memorizes driver&#x27;s seat positions and adjustments, exterior mirror adjustment, and climate control settings. The settings can be customized based on the smart key module being used to unlock and start the car. The Outback can be fitted with twin white LED lights installed on the interior hatch vertically surrounding the rear window, with a separate light switch for additional illumination when the rear hatch is open.

On the first anniversary of the introduction of the fourth generation, &quot;EyeSight&quot; was once again offered on the Japanese-spec Outback. EyeSight consists of 2 cameras with one on each side of the interior rear-view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.

===European models===

== Fifth generation (BS; 2014)==

The fifth-generation Outback appeared in 2014 for the 2015 year model with the sixth generation Legacy, still badged the Legacy Outback for Japan. The sixth-generation Legacy was previewed as a concept at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2013; the Legacy sedan was premiered at Chicago in February 2014, with the Outback following at New York in April. An unrelated Legacy-based &quot;sports tourer&quot; wagon, the Subaru Levorg, was shown in 2013 and first sold in 2014. Elsewhere, the Outback became a free-standing model line of its own, independent of the Legacy, thus bringing greater product differentiation between the two.

Subaru billed the exterior styling evolution as being shaped by the concept of &#x27;more Outback&#x27;, claiming to combine the strengths of passenger cars and sport-utility vehicles and capitalizing on the brand recognition gained from selling the Outback since 1995. EyeSight was offered for the first time in the European market on the new Outback. Chassis stiffness was improved for the fifth-generation Outback. To reduce aerodynamic drag, the side view mirrors were mounted on the sheet metal of the front doors rather than the base of the A-pillar, as was the case with previous models.

From 2018, some world markets also offered Subaru Adaptive Driving Beam (ADB) that allow a driver to leave their high beam switched on at all times, and in combination with EyeSight, adjust a series of shutters that cover portions of the high beam light projection to prevent dazzling oncoming drivers whilst maintaining visibility of the rest of the road, or to &quot;draw a box&quot; of low beam around a lead vehicle that adjusts left and right working with SRH in line with that vehicle&#x27;s movement. Other additions include front and side cameras along with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the ability to change the color of the combination meter illuminated rings to one of eleven different colors.

The fifth-generation Subaru Outback is now classified as a &#x27;crossover&#x27;, with the body and wheelbase set larger than previous models. Other technical changes such as the larger 3.6L &quot;EZ36&quot; engine have pushed it into this classification. The Outback received a Top Safety Pick award from the IIHS, an ASV+ rating from JNCAP, and five stars from NHTSA.

The fifth-generation Outback retained the same 2.5-litre &quot;FB25&quot; and 3.6-litre &quot;EZ36&quot; engines from the 2013 refresh; the &quot;FB25&quot; was slightly revised to improve mid-range torque. In China, the uplevel engine was a turbocharged 2.0-litre &quot;FA20F&quot; instead of the &quot;EZ36&quot;. In the United States, the Outback was only offered with a single transmission choice, Subaru&#x27;s continuously variable transmission branded Lineartronic. In Canada, a manual transmission was available with the 2.5-litre Base and Touring models until 2017.

== Outback Sport==
Subaru also released the first generation Impreza-based Outback Sport in 1994 to North America only for the 1995 model year.

<text>The Nissan Maxima is a five-passenger, front-engine, front-drive sedan that was manufactured and marketed by Nissan as Nissan&#x27;s flagship sedan primarily in North America, the Middle East, South Korea, and China — across eight generations. The Maxima debuted for model year 1982 as the Datsun Maxima, replacing the Datsun 810.

The Maxima was marketed as an upscale alternative to the Altima and prior to 1993, the Stanza, distinguished by features such as a premium interior and V6 engine. Most Maximas were built in Oppama, Japan, until North American assembly began in Smyrna, Tennessee, for the 2004 model year.

For the US and Canada, Nissan ended production of the Maxima in July 2023.

Outside North America, the &quot;Maxima&quot; nameplate has also been applied to variants or trim levels of several other models.

== First generation (1981–1984) ==
The first car to wear the Maxima name, the second-generation Datsun 810, was introduced in 1980 for the 1981 model year. It was essentially a Japanese-market Datsun Bluebird (910) with the wheelbase extended to accommodate the inline-six engine. This model replaced the Datsun 810 (first generation). The second-generation Datsun 810 was not marketed in Japan, only in North America as the lower trim Datsun 810 Deluxe and upper trim 810 Maxima. Both were available with either sedan or wagon bodywork. In 1981 for the 1982 model year, all 810s were rebranded as Datsun Maxima. In 1983 for the 1984 model year, the last year of the first-generation Maxima, North American Datsuns began carrying the &quot;Nissan&quot; badge as well. Only 1984 model year Nissans have rear &quot;Nissan&quot; and &quot;Datsun&quot; badges, although earlier models had a &quot;Datsun&quot; badge with a small &quot;by Nissan&quot; designation below.

For the first model year, the 810 Deluxe came with a five-speed manual transmission, while the upper trim 810 Maxima only came with a three-speed automatic. The Maxima&#x27;s introduction to North America followed the successful introduction of the Datsun 240Z, and used the same engine and transmission while offering luxury content four doors. The sedans have independent rear suspension while the wagon has a leaf sprung live rear axle. The wagon also received rear drums rather than disc brakes.

The second generation retained the same 2.4-liter base engine as the previous Datsun 810, although up by 2 to and with more torque available at a lower engine speed. It was also available with the 2.8-liter &quot;LD28&quot; OHC inline-six diesel engine (available in the US from mid-1981 through 1983) with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.

Some of the power steering pumps were sourced from General Motors&#x27; Saginaw Gear division, while others were sourced from Atsugi. This was the second Nissan to use US-sourced parts besides the Borg-Warner T-5 transmission used in the 82–86 Nissan ZX Turbos. The use of USA-made parts was phased in prior to the passage of local content laws imposed by the U.S. Government.

The Maxima featured a phonograph-based voice warning system. Warnings an open door, etc. would be relayed through the miniaturized phonograph and played audibly: &quot;door is open, key is in ignition, etc.&quot; 1981 models were the first &#x27;talking car&#x27; marketed in the US and offered only one voice warning, a female voice reminding the driver to &quot;Please turn off the lights&quot;.


== Second generation (1985–1988) ==
On October 17, 1984, the first front-wheel drive Maxima (based on the Bluebird U11) was introduced for the 1985 model year. This Maxima was available with a , 3.0-liter &quot;VG30E&quot; V6 engine and a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission. In Japan, a smaller 2.0-liter version of this engine was fitted. These engines were the first V6 engine to be mass-produced in Japan, and the first Nissan to utilize a V6 engine with front wheel drive. The second generation was assigned compact status in the US market. This was the last generation to be available as a station wagon, a version which had been offered since the Datsun 810 days.

In late 1986, the 1987 Maxima was introduced with a freshened exterior and interior. Automatic shoulder belts were now found on both the 1987 sedan and wagons built after February 1987. Luxury amenities were offered on both the &quot;base&quot; GL, later renamed GXE and SE trim levels. Such features for the GL/GXE included digital touch entry system on the driver and passenger side door panel, power windows, locks, antenna, power seats, remote trunk release, voice warning system, optional leather seating, optional heated front seats, an optional Electronics Pkg (a sedan exclusive, it included a digital instruments and a trip computer) and an optional power sunroof (sunroof was standard on Maxima wagons). 15-inch alloy wheels were standard for the Maxima.

An exclusive option for 1988 was the DUET-SS Super Sonic Suspension -which was part of the Electronics Pkg- replacing the trip computer that was previously offered. This feature used sonar waves to monitor the road conditions ahead and adjusted the shocks accordingly for the most controlled ride. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were installed on a trailing arm suspension for both the front and rear wheels. 1988 was also the year that the previously standard digital touch system offered on the GXE sedan became part of the &#x27;Electronics Package&#x27; option as well. The SE (and some GXEs) offered dual power seats, a five-speed manual transmission, three-way shock adjustable suspension, front and rear windshield defroster, and a factory-installed security system. The SE also has a small rear spoiler, all-wheel disc brakes, black side rear view mirrors, and body molding (GXE got body-color side rear-view mirrors and matching body molding). Again, the Maxima&#x27;s prime competitor was the similarly specified Toyota Cressida, which remained rear wheel drive. The Maxima provided a combination of luxury and sporty features while the Cressida was generally seen as being softer and more luxurious.

The Japanese market received either four-door hardtop sedan or pillared sedan bodywork and a 2.0-liter V6 engine (with an available turbocharger). It received the smaller V6 engine so that it would avoid bigger taxes on vehicles with larger engine displacement. The station wagon bodywork was not available in the home market, with the hardtop exclusive to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; Japanese dealerships.

== Third generation (1988–1993) ==
The redesigned Maxima debuted on October 24, 1988 for the 1989 model year, internally designated &quot;J30&quot;. Larger dimensions made it the second Japanese sedan sold in North America to qualify as a &quot;mid-size&quot; (after the Mazda 929). Nissan used a &quot;4DSC&quot; window decal on the third-generation Maxima in North America, marketing it as a &quot;four-door sports car.&quot; This generation was briefly marketed in Japan, replacing the Nissan Leopard sedan at &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations. A refresh occurred in August 1991 for the 1992 model year (from July 1991 production), adding a driver&#x27;s side SRS airbag. The facelifted version was no longer offered in Japan.

It now featured the , 3.0-liter &quot;VG30E&quot; V6, with the , &quot;VE30DE&quot; unit standard on the SE model starting in 1991. In the United States, the &quot;VG30E&quot; engine, which featured a variable intake manifold on automatic and manual transmission models, was used on all 1989 to 1994 GXE models and 1989 to 1991 SE models. This generation Maxima was fitted with an independent trailing arm rear suspension, and continued to offer the road scanning, electronic Super Sonic Suspension (sonar). The digital touch entry system on the GXE (in conjunction with the new Luxury Package) allowed the windows to be lowered and the moon roof opened from outside the vehicle on a keypad integrated on the front door handle, without the key in the ignition. One of the industry&#x27;s first heads-up displays was also included in the package for model years 1989–92. The system projected a holographic image of the vehicle&#x27;s speed on a small screen in the windshield.

The VE30DE engine was exclusively offered on the 1992–1994 Maxima SE. It was a 3.0-liter, 24 valve, DOHC motor. Its iron block was topped with aluminum cylinder heads and featured a dual length intake manifold (5-speed model only), variable intake valve timing, coil on plug ignition, plus a limited-slip differential. The VE30DE was rated at at 5600 rpm and at 4000 rpm, and had a 6500 rpm redline. SE models include white-faced gauges, twisted-spoke turbine wheels (.5 inch wider than GXE wheels and similar in design to wheels offered on the Z31 300ZX), body-colored grille, twin-tip mufflers, factory-tinted tail lights, black trim replacing chrome, firmer sport suspension, and optional 5-speed manual transmission. The automatic transmission on all GXEs (RE4F02A) was a compact unit from Jatco, which featured &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot; modes that shifted at different points. The 1992 to 1994 SE received an optional automatic transmission (RE4F04V) that had stronger internals, but kept the &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot; modes. The SE also had a rear spoiler and black side mirrors, whereas the GXE has body-color side mirrors.


During this year, the Maxima was first introduced to the European market, replacing the Laurel. For European markets, the model range was: 3.0, 3.0 S, and 3.0 SE. The only engine was the single-cam VG30E, producing .

Nissan Australia began importing the J30 series for a May 1990 release to replace the locally assembled Nissan Skyline (R31) sedan and station wagon. Powertrain comprised the 3.0-liter &quot;VG30E&quot; V6 rated at and a four-speed automatic. Nissan made the Maxima available in two equipment grades, the M and Ti. The M featured air conditioning, alloy wheels, central locking, cruise control, power steering, and power windows. The Ti added a rear spoiler, climate control air conditioning, anti-lock brakes, electric seats and a PIN touch-pad locking system. The M-based LE of late 1991 featured a CD player and sunroof. There was also a leather/sunroof pack optional on Ti. Nissan Australia released a facelift in January 1993 that included a new grille insert, revised tail lamps, wheels and cabin trim. A driver airbag was now fitted to the Ti, and made optional on the new Executive trim that replaced the M. The J30 in Australia was replaced in February 1995 by a new Maxima based on the Nissan Cefiro (A32).

The three variants assembled locally in New Zealand had automatic transmissions and the VG30E Engine only. Versions sold in Japan and Europe had a manual transmission option as an alternative to the automatic transmission that was standard in North America and Australia/New Zealand. The Maxima SE was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1990.

Another Bluebird Maxima continued on as a Nissan Bluebird (U12) and solely as a station wagon with the &quot;VG20ET&quot; engine during this period until the introduction of the U13 Bluebird, and the Avenir replaced the Bluebird wagon altogether.
== Fourth generation (1994–1999) ==
Designed from early 1990 to March 1991, the fourth-generation Maxima arrived in May 1994 for the 1995 model year as the &quot;A32&quot;. A new &quot;VQ30DE&quot; 190 hp (141 kW), 3.0 liter V6 was the only engine option for the North American market. The VQ30DE earned a first spot on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines List, and the VQ has now been recognized consecutively for every year since its introduction (as of 2012, 18 years running). The independent rear suspension of the previous generation was replaced with a lighter multi-link beam system, part of a general trend of cost-cutting by Japanese manufacturers in the wake of the bursting of Japan&#x27;s economic bubble of the early 1990s.

The Maxima&#x27;s primary competitor, the Toyota Cressida, was discontinued after the 1992 model year, with Toyota touting the front-wheel-drive Toyota Avalon, a stretched version of the Toyota Camry introduced in 1994, as its replacement.


The North American 1995 Maxima included a Bose Sound System on the GLE (optional on the SE), which had a 6-speaker sound system, a Clarion system was also an option (non-Bose). The fourth-generation Maxima was highly praised for its quiet, roomy interior. This Maxima was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Import Car of the Year for 1995. The Maxima &quot;SE&quot; again made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1995 and 1996.

The 1995&#x27;s VQ30DE (3.0 liter) engine produced and of torque. With the manual transmission 0–60 mph took 6.6 seconds with a quarter-mile time of 15.2-seconds at 92.4-mph, making it both the quickest and fastest (142 mph top speed) Japanese sedan on the North American market at that time. A top-of-the-line 1995 Maxima GLE equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission turned in a 7.6 second 0-60-mph run with a 15.8-second/88.6-mph quarter-mile time.

At the time, the Maxima was one of few four-door, six-cylinder cars sold in North America with a standard manual transmission. A viscous limited slip differential came standard on Canadian SE models equipped with the 5-speed manual (in the US, the VLSD was restricted to the Infiniti I30). The automatic was a no cost option, which most Maximas were equipped with.

In October 1996, the Maxima&#x27;s exterior was refreshed for 1997, with new five-spoke alloy wheels, plastic (clear-lens) headlights vs. the previous glass headlights, a slightly different front and rear fascia with new redesigned tail-lights, the rear-facing part of the trunk was smoothed out to match the tail-lights, redesigned fog-lights and badge designs, and a chrome grille insert for GLE&#x27;s (body color for SE models) was added. Among interior changes were a different steering wheel and CD player. Front seat-mounted side impact airbags were added as an option for 1998 and 1999 SE and GLE models. There were also structural modifications to improve crash worthiness for the 1997 to 1999 models. The 1999 Nissan Maxima also saw some minor changes: an Anti-Theft Engine Immobilizer was standard using a chip in the ignition key, as well as some minor body trims. The 1999 Maxima SE was also available with a Limited Package which consisted of Titanium tinted SE-Limited emblems on the front doors, titanium tinted trunk emblems, and titanium tinted 16&quot; alloy wheels. The interior gauge cluster was also titanium tinted and the optional leather seats were perforated and embossed with SE on the backrests. The front floor mats were also embossed with SE-Limited logos.

As the Maxima badge was retired in Japan, this particular generation was sold there as the Nissan Cefiro A32. The Cefiro badge had previously been used on a Nissan Laurel-based, higher specification model with rear-wheel drive (see A31 Cefiro). For the Japanese market, a Cefiro-badged station wagon was also available. One version of the Cefiro (Brougham VIP spec) was sold in the US as the Infiniti I30, yet the Cefiro had subtle differences including different fog light arrangements, one-piece headlights and a few assorted engine options (VQ20/25/30DE). The Cefiro was actually introduced first, in August 1994, and was originally available with 2 and 2.5-liter V6 engines with JIS.

This generation was also sold as the Maxima QX in Europe and other parts of the world, and was mostly identical to the Japanese Cefiro except for minor trim differences. In Europe a smaller, two-liter V6 engine with was available in addition to the larger 3.0, to suit local taxation structures.
== Fifth generation (2000–2003) ==
Introduced in May 1999, the 2000 Maxima was designed at Nissan&#x27;s La Jolla, California design studio 1996–1997 under the direction of Jerry Hirshberg, and was internally designated &quot;A33B&quot;. The fifth-generation Maxima was a badge engineered variant of the JDM &quot;A33&quot; Nissan Cefiro, which was itself marketed globally, including by Nissan North America&#x27;s luxury &quot;Infiniti&quot; brand as the I30 and subsequently as the I35. The A33 Cefiro was marketed in Europe as the Maxima QX.

The engine was a 3.0 L &quot;VQ30DE&quot; V6 for all versions except the SE, which produced . The vehicle has a 0–60 mph time of 7.0 seconds. This variant of the VQ30DE was referred to as the VQ30DE-K. The A33b was offered in GXE (base), GLE (luxury, with 16 inch alloy wheels) and SE trim levels, the latter offering a rear trunklid spoiler.

For the 2001 model year, Nissan offered an SE model trim package commemorating the model&#x27;s 20th anniversary. In addition to SE content, the commemorative edition used the Infiniti I30 engine, ground effect rocker panels, drilled metal &quot;brushed metallic&quot; pedals, brushed metallic shifter, and stainless steel door embossed sill plates. The optional leather interior was perforated, unlike that in the regular SE. Finally, the &quot;SE Comfort and Convenience Package&quot; included a sunroof and 17&quot; dark chrome alloy wheels.

For the 2002 model year, the Maxima received a mild facelift. The A33B received the 3.5 L &quot;VQ35DE&quot; producing and of torque, the engine used in the Infiniti I35. The facelifted version received a larger, revised grille and front bumper openings, revised foglamps with vertical lines in the glass lens, larger Nissan emblem on the grille, a revised headlamp design with high-intensity discharge (HID) low beams, a six-speed manual transmission with optional helical Torsen limited-slip differential borrowed from the Japan market Nissan Skyline GT-R (identified by brushed, metal pedals for the accelerator, brake, and clutch), revised 17-inch 6-spoke alloy wheels in silver on the SE model, new 17-inch 7-spoke machined alloy wheels on the GLE model, clear Altezza-style taillights, a revised rocker moulding/side skirt standard on all models, and interior and refinements over the 2000 to 2001 models.

Some interior differences include slightly redesigned seats, a smaller screw-on shift knob on automatic models along with a different shift pattern, a redesigned steering wheel, revised headunits, and a different cup holder lid. Facelift SE models equipped with the six-speed manual transmissions were capable of 0-60 acceleration of 6.0 seconds with a 1/4 mile time of 14.7 seconds at 97 mph. The 2002–2003 models also posted better braking numbers, requiring 182 feet to stop from 70 mph, compared with the 195 feet of the earlier model.

For 2003, Nissan offered an option to SE trim, marketed as the &quot;Titanium Edition&quot;, including gloss titanium color 6-spoke alloy wheels and titanium interior accents. In the United States, the &quot;Meridian Edition&quot; option included heated front seats, steering wheel and outside mirrors; the Leather Package included leather-appointed seats, 4-way power passenger&#x27;s seat and power driver&#x27;s seat with memory function and entry/exit feature (SE A/T, std. GLE). Other options included Power Glass Sliding Sunroof with tilt (SE, GLE); front seat side- impact supplemental air bags (SE, GLE); traction control system (SE automatic, GLE); helical limited-slip differential (SE manual); Bose audio system (SE, std. GLE) and Nissan Navigation System (SE, GLE). In Russia and Europe, the Maxima was marketed as Nissan Maxima QX.


== Sixth generation (2004–2008) ==
The sixth-generation Maxima, code-named A34, was marketed solely in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It was developed from 1998 to 2002, with a March 2001 design freeze. It was introduced in production form as a 2004 model at the 2003 North American International Auto Show. In the US, it came with the &quot;VQ35DE&quot;, a DOHC V6 engine that produced 265 hp (198 kW) at 5,800 rpm, and of torque at 4,400 rpm and a standard SkyView fixed glass paneled roof that ran down the center of the roof (from front to back) or an optional traditional style moonroof. Sixth-generation Maximas were available in two trim levels, SE and SL. The sporty SE model came standard with 18 inch alloy wheels, P245/45R18 V-rated tires, stiffer suspension, rear spoiler, and an optional 6-speed manual transmission. The luxurious SL model came standard with 17 inch alloy wheels, P225/55R17 H-rated tires, wood interior trim, 6-disc CD changer, Bose stereo, leather seats, and HID headlights and optional heated front seats. The manual transmission was never offered in the SL model and the suspension is tuned for a softer ride. For all models, the rear independent suspension returned, this time using a multilink setup similar to the Altima.

For 2007, the U.S. Maxima became available with a standard Xtronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) (similar to the CVT found in the Nissan Murano) as the only transmission choice; a manual transmission was no longer offered, however the CVT featured a manual mode. It featured a freshened front fascia (lacking the center block, the new grille closely resembled that of the 2007 Altima). Headlights were also more squared around the edges. New interior changes included an Intelligent Key system with integrated ignition tab, new center console, and new white-and-orange gauges as opposed to the older pure orange ones.

For 2008, the Maxima&#x27;s fuel economy dropped from 21MPG-City / 28MPG-Highway to 19/25 due to new EPA measurement methods. A Platinum Edition package of convenience features was added for 2008 on both SE and SL trim levels.

In Australia, the Maxima had the same engine, but Nissan set the maximum power to only . The Australian version was code-named J31, shared the VQ engine, initially only came with a four-speed automatic transmission, and had quite noticeable styling differences to the North American version as it was based on the Nissan Teana. In 2007, it received a minor mid-life facelift and an all-new CVT automatic transmission.

The North American Maxima was known for a balance between sport and luxury; other models tended to focus more on comfort.
== Seventh generation (2009–2014) ==

Nissan presented the redesigned Maxima for model year 2009 at the 2008 New York International Auto Show. The seventh-generation Maxima (A35) uses the Nissan D platform shared with the fourth-generation Nissan Altima and second-generation Nissan Murano. It serves as Nissan&#x27;s North American top front-wheel-drive sedan.

The A35 featured a revised version of the &quot;VQ35DE&quot; engine producing and of torque. A revised version of Nissan&#x27;s Xtronic CVT (continuously variable transmission) with paddle shifting was the only transmission offered, with no manual or regular automatic available. A diesel version was expected to be released for the 2010 model year, although those plans were not realized. The new Maxima was offered in S and SV trims with several premium and technology packages available. The Maxima&#x27;s design traded height and length for a sleeker styling, although the width was increased slightly. The keyless ignition uses a push button to start and stop the engine. In the U.S., the seventh generation Maxima went on sale in late June 2008. The SkyView center glass was replaced by a retractable panoramic moonroof for A35 series Maxima.

=== Model year changes ===

;2012
For 2012, Nissan modestly freshened the Maxima&#x27;s exterior, with a new grille, taillights and new alloy wheels in 18- and 19-inch diameters. Three new exterior colors, Java Metallic, Dark Slate, and Pearl White are available.

The cabin received a few small trim changes, but was mostly carried over from 2011.
A new $710 Limited Edition package on the Maxima 3.5 S bundled smoked xenon headlights, a compass in the rearview mirror, 18-inch dark-silver-finish alloy wheels, rear spoiler, dark satin chrome grille, foglights, outside mirrors with integrated turn signals and metallic trim.

;2013
The 2013 Nissan Maxima still remained the same for the most part and was available with three new option packages for the new model year. There is the Bose Audio Package, a Bose audio upgrade with SiriusXM Satellite Radio functionality. The &quot;SV Value Package&quot; includes the premium Bose audio setup along with heated front seats, a heated steering wheel and heated outside mirrors. The Sport Package included alloy wheels and a climate-controlled driver&#x27;s seat, combined with the Maxima Monitor Package (a rearview camera system, seven-inch color monitor, USB port and an iPod storage net).

;2014
Nissan&#x27;s flagship Maxima sedan entered the 2014 model year in late August 2013 with the addition of a new S Value Package. This has smoked appearance HID Xenon headlights, a compass in the rearview mirror, rear spoiler, fog lights, outside mirrors with integrated turn signals and metallic trim treatment. The Monitor and HID Xenon Packages were no longer available, while the SV received most of the Monitor package as standard. There were two new exterior colors: Gun Metallic (replaces Dark Gray) and Midnight Garnet (replaces Tuscan Sun); for eight available exterior colors total. The 3.5 S and 3.5 SV were the available models, each powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine mated to an Xtronic CVT. 2014 was the last year for this generation Nissan Maxima despite it carrying over into 2015 as a 2014 model year. Nissan stated &quot;they will have plenty 2014 Nissan Maximas on dealer lots until the all-new 2016 Nissan Maxima arrives&quot; in calendar year 2015.

== Eighth generation (2015–2023) ==


The eighth-generation Maxima was unveiled at the April 2015 New York International Auto Show. Sporting an athletic body redesign, Nissan calls it a &quot;four-door sports car&quot;, a marketing term first used on the third-generation J30 series (1988–1992). The Nissan Sport Sedan Concept shown in the 2014 Detroit Auto Show previewed the exterior design of the vehicle. The vehicle is 82 pounds lighter than before, with a revamped interior taking inspiration from aerospace. The &quot;VQ35DE&quot; engine was carried over with minor updates and more power, now rated at and of torque. The Maxima is available with six exterior color options and three trim levels: SV, SR, and Platinum. There was also an SR Midnight Edition that was introduced in 2016. The Midnight Edition blacked out most chrome (Grille, rims, rear chrome, exhaust tips, etc.) and added a more sporty appearance to the Maxima. The Midnight Edition was discontinued after the 2018 model year. For the 2021 model year a 40th Anniversary edition is available with unique Ruby Slate Grey Pearl paint, black exterior &amp; interior trim, black wheels, 40th Anniversary floor mats &amp; exterior badge and a unique white face gauge cluster.

This generation Maxima made its debut in China at the 2015 Guangzhou Auto Show with the Chinese name 西玛, which they used as the previous generation Nissan Cima.

An updated Maxima was revealed at the 2018 LA Auto Show and released later that year.

The Maxima for Mexico received a facelift on July 9, 2019. It is offered in the Advance, SR, and Exclusive trim lines.

The Nissan Maxima was discontinued from the Mexican market after the 2020 model year. For the US and Canada, Nissan ended production of the Maxima in 2023. However, the Maxima name could be used on an upcoming electric sedan which will get an Infiniti equivalent.

== Sales ==
== Other uses of Maxima name ==

The first use of the &quot;Maxima&quot; badge was in August 1977, as the top equipment level on the Japanese domestic market Nissan Stanza (A10). It has been used intermittently in the Japanese domestic market since then, also on a luxury, hardtop version of the Bluebird.

In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Maxima&quot; name was also used in the mid-1980s as a high series trim designation on the B11 Sunny, N12 Cherry and the Japanese built versions of the T12 Bluebird/Stanza. In the Philippines, the T12 Nissan Auster was sold as the Maxima.

In other markets outside North America, the Maxima J30 series sold internationally between 1990 and 1994, albeit with different frontal styling to the North American version. Between 1994 and 2003, the &quot;Maxima&quot; name was applied to the Nissan Cefiro sold in Australasia, Europe, and South America. From 2003 until 2013, Nissan in Australasia also retailed the Teana under the Maxima badge.

<text>The Ziz (Hebrew: ) is a giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology, said to be large enough to be able to block out the sun with its wingspan.

== Description ==
It is considered a giant animal/monster corresponding to archetypal creatures. Rabbis have said that the Ziz is comparable to the Persian Simurgh, while modern scholars compare the Ziz to the Sumerian Anzû and the Ancient Greek phoenix.

There is only passing mention of the Ziz in the Bible, found in &quot;I know all the birds of the mountains and &quot;Zīz śāday&quot; [] is mine&quot; and &quot;The boar from the forest ravages it, and &quot;zīz śāday&quot; feeds on it&quot;, and these are often lost in translation from the Hebrew, being referred to in most English translations as ambiguous &quot;beasts&quot; and referred to as neither singular nor avian (&quot;śāday&quot; usually being translated as &quot;of the field&quot;) . The Jewish aggadot say of the Ziz:
Non-Jews also knew of the Ziz. Johannes Buxtorf&#x27;s 1603 &quot;Synagoga Judaica&quot; discusses the Ziz. His text is echoed in English by Samuel Purchas in 1613:

Humphrey Prideaux in 1698 describes the Ziz as being like a giant celestial rooster:

<doc id="318165" wikidata="Q3773717" url="?curid=318165" title="Dual board">
<text>A Dual Board or Two Tier system is a corporate structure system that consists of two bodies i.e. the Council of Delegates to govern the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors to manage a corporation. The roles and relationships between the two bodies vary across countries. The structure is composed of two bodies, one focused on management and the other on governance.

In Germany, the Dual Board system is prescribed for corporations that are listed on the stock market (e.g., Lufthansa, and Adidas). It is argued that this approach better serves the objectives of a social market system.

Using a two tier system might also result in &quot;more monitoring&quot; and &quot;less aggressive performance targets&quot;. It might also be &quot;less efficient&quot; from a financial market perspective. It has been suggested that financial efficiency may be impeded by reduced communication, and the higher costs of running a Dual Board.

==History==
The two tier system was first adopted in German companies in the 19th century, and it became compulsory after the Second World War. Other countries that adopted a two tier approach include Finland, China, and the Netherlands. The Singapore Manufacturing Federation recently introduced a &quot;governance body&quot; as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;1/2 tier govt systems&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, 10 countries require the two-tier approach, 8 countries require the single-tier approach, and 9 countries allow the use of either.

==Management Body==
The &quot;Management Body&quot; meets frequently (often weekly) to deal with operational issues. Some contracting decisions and strategic planning decisions may have to be approved by the &quot;Governance Body&quot;. members of the &quot;Management Body&quot; are appointed by the members of the &quot;Governance Body&quot; (see below).

Composition of &quot;Management Body&quot;

Head of &quot;Board of Directors&quot;

*&quot;Chairperson cum Managing Director cum Chief Executive Officer&quot; shall be selected and appointed by the &quot;Council of Delegates&quot;

*&quot;Vice Chairperson cum Deputy Managing Director cum Co-Chief Executive Officer&quot; shall be selected and appointed by the &quot;Council of Delegates&quot;
Members of &quot;Board of Directors&quot;

*The number of &quot;Executive Director cum Chief [Specialisation] Officer&quot; shall be decided and appointed by the &quot;Council of Delegates&quot;

&quot;Note :- Specialisation implies finance, technology, marketing etc.&quot;

==Governance Body==
The &quot;governance body&quot; is usually elected by the Shareholders. Composition varies across jurisdictions; its members are usually independent of the executive but it can include employee representatives in some countries. Generally, the &quot;governance body&quot; guides and monitors the &quot;management body&quot;.

Composition of &quot;Governance Body&quot;

Head of &quot;Council of Delegates&quot;

*&quot;Active Delegate&quot; shall be elected by the &quot;equity shareholders&quot; 
*&quot;Co-Active Delegate&quot; shall be elected by the &quot;equity shareholders&quot; 

Members of &quot;Council of Delegates&quot;

*&quot;Executive Delegates&quot; shall be elected by the &quot;equity shareholders&quot; 
*&quot;Non Executive Delegates&quot; shall be elected by equity shareholders and nominated by the &quot;national government&quot;, &quot;provincial government&quot;, &quot;officers union&quot; of that &quot;corporate establishment&quot; and &quot;employees union&quot; of that &quot;corporate establishment&quot;

Types of Delegates

*&quot;Residential Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Whole time Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Independent Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Alternate Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Women Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Additional Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Nominee Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Small Shareholder Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Shadow Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Casual Vaccancy Delegate&quot;
*&quot;Any other type of &quot;Delegate&quot; to be included&quot;

 The &quot;governance body&quot; is involved in long term strategic planning. Another task that the &quot;Governance Body&quot; is in charge of is the selection, dismissal, and designation of the members in the &quot;Management Body&quot;, to &quot;ensure a long term succession planning&quot;.

==Cooperation Between bodies==
The &quot;Management Body&quot; has to closely cooperate with the &quot;Governance Body&quot; to develop the business strategy, this is done by creating a steady flow of information between the two. The information flow would include risk management, business development and any differences of the development of the business compared to the initial plan. Open discussions between members of the boards are also key to the functionality of the business under a Two Tier System, because these must exchange information frequently.

==Country systems==
Countries with two-tier boards include:
*Germany
*Netherlands
*Austria
*Poland
*Indonesia
*China

Countries where the option of a two-tier board is provided by law include:
*Belgium
*Italy
*France
*Romania

<text>Anthony van Diemen (also &quot;Antonie&quot;, &quot;Antonio&quot;, &quot;Anton&quot;, &quot;Antonius&quot;; 1593 – 19 April 1645) was a Dutch colonial governor.

== Early life ==
Van Diemen was born in Culemborg (now in the Netherlands, then in a county in the Holy Roman Empire), the son of Meeus Anthonisz van Diemen and Christina Hoevenaar. In 1616, he moved to Amsterdam, in hope of improving his fortune as a merchant; in this he failed and was declared bankrupt. After a year he became a servant of the Dutch East India Company and sailed to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (Jakarta), capital of the Dutch East Indies. On the voyage out, the East Indiaman &quot;Mauritius&quot; inadvertently put in on unknown coast of Australia.

== Career ==
Governor Jan Pieterszoon Coen found van Diemen to be a talented official and by 1626 he was Director-General of Commerce and member of the Council for the Indies. In 1630, he married Maria van Aelst. A year later he returned to the Netherlands as Admiral on the ship &quot;Deventer&quot;.

While on route to the Indies in 1633, Van Diemen sighted and named Amsterdam Island, after his vessel at the time, &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot;.

In 1635, he was appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, his appointment taking effect on 1 January 1636.
Van Diemen&#x27;s nine years as Governor-General were successful and important for both the colony and the commercial success of the Dutch East India Company. He devoted much of his energy to expanding the power of the company throughout South-East Asia. Under his rule Dutch power was established in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) via Trincomalee.

== Discovery of Tasmania ==
Van Diemen is best remembered for his efforts to foster exploration of the &quot;Great South Land&quot; (Australia), resulting in &quot;the final and most ambitious Dutch voyages of the century&quot;. The first voyage under his energetic administration was undertaken within three months of his arrival in Batavia; starting from Cape York its ships were to chart the unknown coasts, but the venture ended in failure, when its commander was killed by natives in New Guinea, and the ships returned.

In 1639, he commissioned two voyages to the north, in search of the &quot;Gold and Silver Islands&quot; that Spanish reports placed in the North Pacific to the east of Japan, and sent Maarten Gerritsz Vries to explore the coasts of Korea and &quot;Tartaria&quot;; these, too, returned fruitlessly. Undeterred, Van Diemen appointed Frans Visscher to draw up a plan for new discoveries. Visscher mapped out three different routes and van Diemen decided in August 1642 to send Abel Janszoon Tasman, accompanied by Visscher, in search of the Great South Land, which Tasman would soon dub &quot;Nieuw Holland&quot;.

In November 1642, heading east from Mauritius on latitude 44 and missing the south coast of the Australian continent, Tasman sighted land at what is now the west coast of the island of Tasmania, and followed the coastline along the southern shore and around to the east coast. Tasman sent a party ashore at Blackman Bay, on the Tasman Peninsula, who planted a flag and encountered a few Tasmanian people. Believing he had found a large territory, Tasman named it Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in honour of his patron.

== Legacy ==
Van Diemen is also commemorated in Van Diemen Gulf on the coast of northern Australia. He commissioned a further voyage from Tasman in 1644. Van Diemen died in 1645 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies. The company granted his wife a large pension and she retired to the Netherlands.

Her name is perpetuated in the name of the westernmost point of the North Island of New Zealand, Cape Maria van Diemen, named by Tasman in 1643, and by Maria Island off the east coast of Tasmania. It is one of only two geographical locations in New Zealand to have the name Tasman gave them, the other being Three Kings Islands.

Van Diemen also gives his name to Fort Antonio in modern-day Tamsui at the mouth of the Tamsui River in northern Taipei, Taiwan, which was built by the Dutch on the site of an abandoned Spanish fort in an historical area now known as the Fort Santo Domingo museum complex, the name of which causes ongoing confusion about the actual name of the main fort building along with its Dutch origins. 

In 1842, the venomous Australian and southern Papuan, elapid Whip Snake genus &quot;Demansia&quot; was named in honour of van Diemen by J. E. Gray of the British Museum in London.

<text>(also spelled Yezo or Yeso) is the Japanese term historically used to refer to the people and the lands to the northeast of the Japanese island of Honshu. This included the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, which changed its name from &quot;Ezo&quot; to &quot;Hokkaidō&quot; in 1869, and sometimes included Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. The word Ezo means &quot;the land of the barbarians&quot; in Japanese.

In reference to the people of that region, the same two kanji used to write the word &quot;Ezo&quot; can also be read &quot;Emishi&quot;. The descendants of these people are most likely related to the Ainu people of today.

==Etymology==
Japanese sources that include an etymology describe &quot;Ezo&quot; as probably originally a borrowing from the Ainu word meaning . The term is first attested in Japanese in a text from 1153 in reference to any of the non-Japanese people living in the northeast of Honshū, and then later in 1485 in reference to the northern islands where these people lived, primarily Hokkaido, Karafuto (that is, Sakhalin), and the Kuril Islands.

The kanji spelling is based on the meanings of the characters rather than the phonetics (jukujikun), and is composed of the characters meaning and meaning . The use of the character for might be in reference to the long &quot;whiskers&quot; (antennae) of these animals, alluding to the prominent beards worn by Ainu men.

The spelling &#x27;Yezo&#x27; reflects its pronunciation , when Europeans first came in contact with Japan. It is this historical spelling that is reflected in the scientific Latin term , as in &quot;Fragaria yezoensis&quot; and &quot;Porphyra yezoensis&quot;. However, there are species that use a different spelling, such as the Japanese scallop known as .

==History==
The first published description of Ezo in the West was brought to Europe by Isaac Titsingh in 1796. His small library of Japanese books included by Hayashi Shihei. This book, which was published in Japan in 1785, described the Ezo region and its people.

In 1832, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland supported the posthumous abridged publication of Titsingh&#x27;s French translation of . Julius Klaproth was the editor, completing the task which was left incomplete by the death of the book&#x27;s initial editor, Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat.

==Subdivisions==
 or () was divided into several districts. The first was the Wajinchi, or &#x27;Japanese Lands&#x27;, which covered the Japanese settlements on and around the Oshima Peninsula. The rest of Ezo was known as the (), or &#x27;Ainu Lands&#x27;. There were also Japanese people who moved from other places to the coastal areas of Ezochi. Ezochi was in turn divided into three sections: North Ezochi, which covered southern Sakhalin; West Ezochi, which included the northern half of Hokkaidō; and East Ezochi, which included the populous southern and eastern Hokkaidō and the Kuril Islands.

<text>Jason Iain Flemyng (born 25 September 1966) is an English actor. He is known for his work with British filmmakers Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn appearing in the Ritchie films &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998) and &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), (both films were also produced by Vaughn) and appearing in Vaughn&#x27;s films &quot;Layer Cake&quot; (2004), &quot;Kick-Ass&quot; (2010), and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011).

He has also appeared in Hollywood productions such as &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), the Alan Moore comic book adaptations &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001) and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003), &quot;Transporter 2&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&quot; (2008). He has also appeared in prominent roles in both theatre and television in the UK. Flemyng speaks French fluently, and has made three films in that language. He won the Best Actor Award at the Geneva Film Festival for his role in 1996&#x27;s &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;.

== Early life ==
Flemyng was born on 25 September 1966 in Putney, London, the son of Scottish television and film director Gordon Flemyng. He decided he wanted to become an actor after appearing in theatrical productions at his school, Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Sussex. &quot;I always wanted to be an actor,&quot; he later told the BBC. &quot;From the time I fancied a girl who played Dorothy in the school production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. I auditioned for the role of the scarecrow so that I could have the most stage time with her, but she ended up running off with the tin man!&quot;

In the 1980s, he was involved with the National Youth Theatre and the political organisation the Young Socialists. He also became involved with Militant, an entryist group active within the Labour Party, and in 1987 was expelled from Labour for selling the &quot;Militant&quot; newspaper. Flemyng has subsequently claimed that both his theatrical and political activities at this time were simply a way of meeting girls. In 1990 he studied acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), where he was a classmate of Hermione Norris. Following his graduation from LAMDA in the early 1990s he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.

== Career ==
One of his first prominent roles on screen was a guest appearance in the American television series &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot; in 1992. He was then a regular in the ITV drama series &quot;Doctor Finlay&quot; from 1993 to 1996.

His first film appearance was in the 1994 version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. His first major cinema role was in Angela Pope&#x27;s 1996 drama &quot;Hollow Reed&quot;, where he played a child abuser, followed by a main role in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s popular 1998 London gangster film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. Flemyng later claimed to have lost so much money while playing poker with the film&#x27;s backers in between takes on set that he had to work on the four days of re-shoots the film required for no fee. He went on to appear in films such as &quot;The Red Violin&quot; and &quot;Deep Rising&quot; (1998), &quot;Snatch&quot; (2000), George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Bruiser&quot; (2000) and &quot;Rock Star&quot; (2001). Flemyng also starred in the short film &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, written by Dexter Fletcher, whom he met while working on &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;.

In the early 2000s he featured in two big-budget Hollywood films which were adaptations of Alan Moore comic books; as John Netley in 2001&#x27;s &quot;From Hell&quot;, with Johnny Depp, and 2003&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, with Sean Connery, in which Flemyng played Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde. The latter film was a disappointment, but Flemyng commented that: &quot;It was a bit of a nightmare... the film cost a fortune and didn&#x27;t make back the money it was meant to... But I still get a huge kick out of doing films like that and &quot;From Hell&quot;. Any day you walk onto a set and Sean Connery or Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt is there has to be a good day.&quot;

In parallel with his film career, Flemyng has continued to take various television roles. He told BBC News Online in 2004 that: &quot;Of the 40 feature films I&#x27;ve made, 15 of them failed to make it onto the screen and have only ever been seen by cast and crew. It is very frustrating when a film you really believe in remains unseen. That&#x27;s not a problem with television. If you&#x27;re a painter you don&#x27;t paint a picture and then stick it under the bed – you want people to see it.&quot; In 2005 he played the famous science-fiction role of Professor Bernard Quatermass when digital television channel BBC Four produced a live remake of the 1953 serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment.&quot; In 2005 he also played the part of Dimitry, a Russian ex-biological weapons specialist, in &quot;Transporter 2&quot;, where he was briefly reunited with Jason Statham.

In 2009, Flemyng joined the cast of the ITV science fiction cult drama series &quot;Primeval&quot; during its third series, as maverick ex-policeman Danny Quinn. He received top billing as the series&#x27; new star, taking over from Douglas Henshall. In March 2010 Flemyng earned a lead role as Cpl. Callow in the war/horror film &quot;The 4th Reich&quot;.

On 15 August 2010, it became public that he had been cast in the role of Azazel in the X-Men prequel, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn.

In 2011, Flemyng reprised his character of Danny Quinn in the last episode of &quot;Primeval&quot;″s fourth series, it is said that he would return as Danny Quinn one last time before the finale of the shows fifth series.

In 2012, he starred in &quot;I Give It a Year&quot; (released in Feb 2013), as the bride&#x27;s brother-in-law in a British romcom by Working Title.

After two years Jason just completed work on the feature film &#x27;The Journey&#x27; on which he also serves as Producer, in which he plays Ozzy. The film was written especially for him and took two years to complete, it was filmed in Greece and London and is directed by Lance Nielsen In January 2015, Flemyng signed with UK-based Evolution Pictures to direct the vampire film Eat Locals.

Flemyng appears as himself in the 2018 short film To Trend on Twitter in aid of young people with cancer charity CLIC Sargent with comedians Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton, Helen Lederer and David Baddiel.

In 2021, Audible released Flemyng&#x27;s recording of William Gibson&#x27;s acclaimed sci-fi novel Neuromancer.

==Personal life==
For nine years, Flemyng and actress Lena Headey were a couple; the relationship ended in 2001. Flemyng married Elly Fairman in the summer of 2008, in Tuscany, Italy. The pair have twin boys, Noah and Cassius, who were born in 2012. In 2020, Flemyng said they had all suffered from COVID-19. Flemyng enjoys long-distance running and has completed several marathons. Flemyng is a supporter of Chelsea F.C.

<text>Count was a Japanese general in the Imperial Japanese Army. He was the head of the Japanese First Army during the Russo-Japanese War; and his forces enjoyed a series of successes during the Manchurian fighting at the Battle of Yalu River, the Battle of Liaoyang, the Battle of Shaho and the Battle of Mukden.

==Early life==
Born as the son of a samurai in the Satsuma domain in southern Kyūshū in what is now Kagoshima Prefecture, Kuroki fought for the Shimazu clan against the Tokugawa shogunate forces in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration. He led a platoon of infantry of the 1st Battalion at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi and later at the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle and was appointed a lieutenant in February 1869.

==Imperial Japanese Army==
In July 1871, Kuroki was commissioned a captain in the 1st Battalion, now part of the newly established Imperial Japanese Army. Advancements followed in rapid succession. He was appointed to the 1st Grenadier Battalion in August 1872 and promoted to major. In February 1875, aged only 31, he was appointed commander of the 12th Hiroshima Infantry Regiment and promoted to lieutenant-colonel.

During the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, Kuroki commanded a regiment against his own clan. He was promoted to colonel in November 1878 and appointed commander of the 2nd Grenadiers. He was promoted to major-general in May 1885 and to lieutenant-general in November 1893. He commanded the IJA 6th Division in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), during which time he took part in the Battle of Weihaiwei.

==Russo-Japanese War==

Promoted to the rank of general in November 1903, Kuroki was appointed commander of the Japanese First Army upon the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War the following year. After landing his forces at Chemulpo near Seoul in mid-February, Kuroki advanced north routing a smaller Russian force at the Battle of the Yalu River on 30 April-1 May 1904. Commanding the Japanese left flank at the Battle of Liaoyang, he repulsed a disorganized Russian attack from 25 August-3 September.

During the Battle of Shaho, Kuroki&#x27;s forces again successfully defended against the Russian offensive under General Aleksei Nikolaevich Kuropatkin from 5 October-17 October and later commanded the Japanese right flank at the Battle of Mukden from 21 February-10 March 1905.

During the war, Kuroki was obliged to devote attention to a large coterie of Western observers. Press coverage of the war was affected by restrictions on the movement of reporters and strict censorship. In all military conflicts which followed, close attention to more managed reporting was considered essential.
The military attaché of the British Indian Army to the Japanese First Army, General Sir Ian Hamilton, would directly apply lessons learned in Kuroki&#x27;s retinue. In the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign he appointed Captain William Maxwell, a British journalist who had reported on the Russo-Japanese War for the London &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to be Chief Field Censor. These experiences also provided a model that the U.S. military attaché, Captain John J. Pershing would adopt a decade later in Europe when he persuaded American journalist Frederick Palmer to take on the task of press accreditation for the American Expeditionary Force in France in World War I. Palmer, like Pershing, had experienced the Russo-Japanese War through the restrictions Kuroki had imposed.

==Later years==
Despite his success and previous military record, Kuroki was one of two senior field commanders denied promotion to Field Marshal, thought to be largely because of his Satsuma origins at a time when the government was dominated by Chōshū rivals, although this may have been due to the internal politics within the Japanese Imperial Army of the time.

Retiring from military service in 1909, he received the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) and later &quot;hakushaku&quot; (count) under the &quot;kazoku &quot; peerage system. From 1917 onwards he served as a until his death from pneumonia in 1923.

==Honours==

*Hon. Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (GCMG) (20 February 1906)

<text>Aleksey Nikolayevich Kuropatkin (; March 29, 1848January 16, 1925) served as the Russian Imperial Minister of War from January 1898 to February 1904 and as a field commander subsequently. Historians often hold him responsible for major Russian defeats in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 to 1905, most notably at the Battle of Mukden (1905) and at the Battle of Liaoyang (August-September 1904).

==Biography==

===Early years===
Kuropatkin was born in 1848 in Kholmsky Uyezd, Pskov Governorate, in the Russian Empire. His father, a retired army captain, came from landed gentry. Educated in the Cadet Corps and Pavlovsky Military School, Kuropatkin entered the Imperial Russian Army in 1864. On August 8, 1866, he was promoted to lieutenant in the 1st Turkestan Infantry Battalion, and took part in the conquest of Bukhara, the storming of Samarkand and other battles in the Russian conquest of Turkestan. He was promoted to major in August 1870.

From 1872 to 1874, Kuropatkin studied at the Nicholas General Staff Academy, after which he was dispatched as a military attaché to Berlin and Paris, completing his military studies, and with the French troops in French Algeria, accompanying a French expedition to Sahara. Returning to Russia in late 1875, he was assigned to the Turkestan Military District. He was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) for his role in the Russian conquest of Kokand.

From 1875-1876, Kuropatkin was employed in a diplomatic mission to Yaqub Beg (ruler of Kashgaria) to resolve the issues of Russian border claims in the Fergana Valley.

From September 1877 to September 1878, he was Chief of Staff of the 16th Infantry Division. In August 1879, he was commander of the Turkestan Rifle Brigade. In December 1880, he and 5 companies made an 18-day march across 500 miles of desert to join General Mikhail Skobelev’s invasion of Turkmenistan. Kuropatkin led the main assault at the Battle of Geok Tepe on January 24, 1881. He was awarded the Order of St. George (3rd class) for his victory in the battle. After the war, he wrote a detailed and critical history of the operations which was highly regarded.

During the 1880s, Kuropatkin served on the south-eastern frontier in command of the Turkestan Rifle Brigade. He was promoted to major general on January 29, 1882. He joined the General Staff the following year, and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1890.

From 1890 to 1898, Kuropatkin was governor of the Transcaspian Region in Central Asia, based in Askhabad. During his tenure, he was known to have developed trade, agriculture and towns in an area formerly known for endemic banditry and slavery. He established a local judicial and school system, and encouraged the settlement of colonists from the interior provinces of the Russian Empire.

In 1895 on Kuropatkin was bestowed the extraordinary Russian mission, called the Extraordinary Embassy to Persia in order to proclaim the ascension to the throne of Nicholas II. One member of the mission was Pavel Piasetsky, who later painted his famous &quot;Panorama of Persia&quot;, showing the way from Anzali to Teheran.

===Minister of War===

In 1898, Kuropatkin was recalled to St. Petersburg and appointed War Minister. His first priority was of improving the command structure of the army, as well as the living conditions of its officers. His reforms included measures to rejuvenate the army by setting age limits for line officers and candidates for higher office, and by increasing the period of secondment of officers from the General Staff to combat units. He attempted to improve the quality of officers by raising the two-year cadet training program to three years, and by opening seven new cadet schools. He also increased the frequency of training maneuvers.

However, with respect to the lower ranks, Kuropatkin&#x27;s reforms fell short. While aware of the poor standards of food, clothing, and housing, he was unable to secure the necessary funds for improvements, so his activities were confined to improving morale through the increased use of chaplains, the abolition of corporal punishment, and improved field kitchens.

===Russo-Japanese War===
Kuropatkin was involved in the negotiations with the Empire of Japan before the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. He did not support an armed conflict with Japan and opposed the Bezobrazov Circle. His views became firmer after a visit to Japan in June 1903.

Kuropatkin was heavily involved in the fiasco of the Russian land forces during the war. Although the rationale of his military approach was to wage a war of attrition and to avoid an offensive until the Trans-Siberian Railway brought sufficient troops and materiel, his cautiousness and hesitancy markedly influenced the repeated Russian defeats. Military historians consider his indecisiveness and organizational deficiencies in directing large-scale military operations as a major element in the Russian defeat. Kuropatkin also was influenced by his racism against Asians, reportedly telling the Tsar that he would only need two Russian soldiers for every three Japanese soldiers. 

After the Russian defeat at the Battle of Mukden, Kuropatkin was relieved of command and handed over his post to Nikolai Linevich, formerly commander of the 1st Manchurian Army. However, he insisted that he stay at the front and was given permission to take over Linevich&#x27;s old post.

In 1906, following the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Kuropatkin served as a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. However, in 1907 he retired to his country house, and wrote his own, yet candid, defense, which was published in a number of books in several languages. The Russian government reportedly confiscated the history he wrote.

===World War I===
At the start of World War I, Kuropatkin requested to be reinstated and to be sent to the front; however, his requests were blocked by Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich. Nevertheless, once Tsar Nicholas II assumed the post of Supreme Commander, he put Kuropatkin in charge of the Grenadier Corps in October, 1915. At the end of January 1916, he was appointed commander of the 5th Army, and in February 1916, he became Commander of the Northern Front, in succession to General Pavel Plehve, whose health had broken down. In early March, his forces undertook a limited offensive near Riga, but were outflanked and forced to withdraw to the Daugava River. A second and larger offensive later that month only managed to advance a couple of kilometers. Tsar Nicholas II did not accept Kuropatkin&#x27;s excuses of a lack of artillery support, poor roads and bad weather. 
He planned a night attack which included setting up batteries of searchlights to blind the German defenders, a tactic which had worked in 1904 against Japanese troops. Unfortunately for his men in 1915, on being sent &#x27;over the top&#x27;, they were silhouetted and suffered thousands of casualties.

Kuropatkin was relieved of command on July 22, 1916, and reassigned to Turkestan, where the Russian involvement in World War I, especially against the Ottoman Empire was extremely unpopular among the indigenous peoples and which had led to the Central Asian revolt of 1916. Kuropatkin served as Governor-General of the Turkestan Military District as well as ataman of the Semirechye Cossacks and led the brutal suppression of the revolt.

===Post-Revolution===
In the February Revolution of 1917 Kuropatkin was in Petrograd, and quickly pledged his allegiance to the Russian Provisional Government, cutting the royal insignia off his epaulettes. He was confirmed in his post as commander of the Turkestan Military District by Provisional Government War Minister Alexander Guchkov. However, this was disputed by the Bolshevik &quot;Tashkent Soviet of Soldiers and Workers&#x27; Deputies&quot;, who placed him under arrest and sent him back to Petrograd. Freed by order of the Provisional Government, he returned to his home province. Following the October Revolution, he became very skilled at playing the violin and taught at an agriculture school that he had founded, until his death in 1925.

<text>Philip John Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker, (1 November 1889 – 8 October 1982), born Philip John Baker, was a British politician, diplomat, academic, athlete, and renowned campaigner for disarmament. He carried the British team flag and won a silver medal for the 1500m at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1959.

Noel-Baker is the only person to have won an Olympic medal and received a Nobel Prize. He was a Labour Member of Parliament (UK) for 36 years, serving from 1929 to 1931 and again from 1936 to 1970, serving in several ministerial offices and the cabinet. He was created a life peer in 1977.

==Early life and education==
Baker was born 1 November 1889 on in Brondesbury Park, London, England, the sixth of seven children of Canadian-born Quaker Allen Baker and the Scottish-born Elizabeth Balmer Moscrip. His father had moved to England in 1876 to establish a manufacturing business, and served as a Progressive member of the London County Council from 1895 to 1906, and as a Liberal member of the House of Commons for East Finsbury from 1905 to 1918.

Baker was educated at Quaker independent schools: Ackworth School in the West Riding of Yorkshire and Bootham School in York. He studied in the United States at the Quaker-associated Haverford College in Pennsylvania. Returning to England, he studied at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1908 to 1912, obtaining a second in Part I of the history tripos and a first in Part II economics. In addition to his academic endeavours, he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1912 and President of the Cambridge University Athletic Club from 1910 to 1912.

==Athletic career==
He was a competitor in the Olympic Games as a middle-distance runner, both before and after the First World War, representing Great Britain in the 800 metres and 1500 metres at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm. He reached the final of the 1500 metres, won by his fellow countryman Arnold Jackson. At the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Baker was captain of the British track team and carried the team&#x27;s flag. He won his first-round race in the 800 metres, but then concentrated on the 1500 metres, taking the silver medal behind his teammate Albert Hill. He was captain again at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, but did not compete.

==Academic career and military service==
Baker&#x27;s early career was as an academic. Following his graduation from the University of Cambridge in 1912, he was awarded the Whewell Scholarship in international law. In 1914, he was appointed as vice-principal of Ruskin College, Oxford, then an adult education establishment for working class men which is not part of the University of Oxford. In 1915, he was elected a fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, his &quot;alma mater&quot;. 

During the First World War, Baker organised and led the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit attached to the fighting front in France (1914–1915), and was then, as a conscientious objector from 1916, adjutant of the First British Ambulance Unit for Italy, in association with the British Red Cross (1915–1918), for which he received military medals from the UK, France and Italy.

==Political career==
After World War I, Noel-Baker was closely involved in the formation of the League of Nations, serving as assistant to Lord Robert Cecil, then assistant to Sir Eric Drummond, the league&#x27;s first secretary-general. According to historian Susan Pedersen &quot;Baker was far to the left of Drummond politically, but he had the kind of formation, connections, and intimate understanding of British officialdom’s rules of the game that made for easy collaboration between the two.&quot; Noel-Baker did much of the League&#x27;s early work on the mandates system.

He became the first Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics (which was then part of the University of London) from 1924 to 1929, and a lecturer at Yale University from 1933 to 1934. His political career with the Labour Party began in 1924 when he stood, unsuccessfully, for Parliament in the Conservative safe seat of Birmingham Handsworth. He was elected as the member for Coventry in 1929, and served as parliamentary private secretary to the Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson.

Noel-Baker lost his seat in 1931, but remained Henderson&#x27;s assistant while Henderson was president of the World Disarmament Conference in Geneva in 1932 to 1933. He stood for Parliament again in Coventry in 1935, unsuccessfully, but won the Derby by-election in July 1936 after the sitting Derby Member of Parliament J. H. Thomas resigned. When that constituency was split in 1950, he transferred to Derby South.

Noel-Baker became a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee in 1937. On 21 June 1938, Noel-Baker, as M.P. for Derby, in the run up to World War II, spoke at the House of Commons against aerial bombing of German cities based on moral grounds. &quot;The only way to prevent atrocities from the air is to abolish air warfare and national air forces altogether.&quot;

In the coalition government during the World War II he was a parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of War Transport from February 1942, and served as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs after Labour gained power following the 1945 general election, but had a poor relationship with the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin. Noel-Baker moved to become Secretary of State for Air in October 1946, and then became Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in 1947 and joined the cabinet.

Noel-Baker was the minister responsible for organising the 1948 Olympic Games in London. He moved to the Ministry of Fuel and Power in 1950. In the mid-1940s, Noel-Baker served on the British delegation to what became the United Nations, helping to draft its charter and other rules for operation as a British delegate. He served as Chairman of the Labour Party in 1946–47, but lost his place on the National Executive Committee in 1948, his place being taken by Michael Foot. An opponent of left-wing Bevanite policies in the 1950s, and an advocate of multilateral nuclear disarmament, rather than a policy of unilateral disarmament, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1959. In 1979, with Fenner Brockway, he co-founded the World Disarmament Campaign, serving as co-Chair until he died, and was an active supporter of disarmament into the 1980s.

Noel-Baker stood down as the MP for Derby South at the 1970 general election, at which he was succeeded by Walter Johnson. His life peerage was announced in the 1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours and, aged 87, he was raised to the peerage 22 July 1977, as Baron Noel-Baker, of the City of Derby, having declined an appointment as a Companion of Honour in the 1965 New Year Honours. He was president of the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education from 1960 to 1976. Noel-Baker was an active contributor to House of Lords debates into his nineties, speaking in debates on the ongoing Falklands War in the months preceding his death.

A memorial garden, the Philip Noel-Baker Peace Garden, exists within Elthorne Park, a small park in the London Borough of Islington.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Noel-Baker in April 1977, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; Noel-Baker discusses the League of Nations Union and the Peace Ballot of 1934–35, as well as his work with the United Nations Association and the work of Kathleen Courtney. 

==Personal life==
In June 1915, Philip John Baker married Irene Noel, a field hospital nurse in East Grinstead, subsequently adopting the hyphenated name Noel-Baker in 1921 by deed poll. His wife was a friend of Virginia Woolf. Their only son, Francis, also became a Labour MP and served together with his father in the Commons. Their marriage, however was not a success and Noel-Baker&#x27;s mistress from 1936 was Megan Lloyd George, daughter of the former Liberal Party leader David Lloyd George, herself a Liberal and later Labour MP. The relationship ended when Irene died in 1956. 

He died at home in Westminster on 8 October 1982.

<doc id="318180" wikidata="Q232803" url="?curid=318180" title="Empress Jingū">
<text>was a legendary Japanese empress who ruled as a regent following her husband&#x27;s death in 200 AD. Both the and the (collectively known as the &quot;Kiki&quot;) record events that took place during Jingū&#x27;s alleged lifetime. Legends say that after seeking revenge on the people who murdered her husband, she then turned her attention to a &quot;promised land.&quot; Jingū is thus considered to be a controversial monarch by historians in terms of her alleged invasion of the Korean Peninsula. This was in turn possibly used as justification for imperial expansion during the Meiji period. The records state that Jingū gave birth to a baby boy whom she named &quot;Homutawake&quot; three years after he was conceived by her late husband.

Jingū&#x27;s reign is conventionally considered to have been from 201 to 269 AD, and was considered to be the 15th Japanese imperial ruler until the Meiji period. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the name &quot;Jingū&quot; was used by later generations to describe this legendary Empress. It has also been proposed that Jingū actually reigned later than she is attested. While the location of Jingū&#x27;s grave (if any) is unknown, she is traditionally venerated at a kofun and at a shrine. It is accepted today that Empress Jingū reigned as a regent until her son became Emperor Ōjin upon her death. She was additionally the last de facto ruler of the Yayoi period.

==Legendary narrative==

The Japanese have traditionally accepted this regent&#x27;s historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Jingū is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical and , which are collectively known as or &quot;Japanese chronicles&quot;. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. According to extrapolations from mythology, Jingū&#x27;s birth name was , she was born sometime in 169 AD. Her father was named , and her mother . Her mother is noted for being a descendant of , a legendary prince of Korea (despite the fact that Amenohiboko is believed to have moved to Japan between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, at least 100 years after the extrapolated birth year of his granddaughter Jingū). At some point in time she wed Tarashinakahiko (or Tarashinakatsuhiko), who would later be known as Emperor Chūai and bore him one child under a now disputed set of events. Jingū would serve as &quot;Empress consort&quot; during Chūai&#x27;s reign until his death in 200 AD.

Emperor Chūai died in 200 AD, having been killed directly or indirectly in battle by rebel forces. Okinagatarashi-hime no Mikoto then turned her rage on the rebels whom she vanquished in a fit of revenge. She led an army in an invasion of a &quot;promised land&quot; (sometimes interpreted as lands on the Korean Peninsula), and returned to Japan victorious after three years. While returning to Japan she was nearly shipwrecked but managed to survive thanks to praying to Watatsumi, and she made the shrine to honor him. Ikasuri Shrine and Ikuta Shrine and Watatsumi Shrine were both also made at the same time by the Empress. She then ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne as Empress Jingū, and legend continues by saying that her son was conceived but unborn when Chūai died.

According to a certain source Empress Jingu had sex with the god Azumi-no-isora while pregnant with Emperor Ojin after he said from the womb that it was acceptable, and then Azumi no Isora gave her the tide jewels, and she later strapped a stone to her stomach to delay the birth of her son. After those three years she gave birth to a baby boy whom she named &quot;Homutawake&quot;.

The narrative of Empress Jingū invading and conquering the Korean Peninsula is now considered controversial and up for debate due to the complete lack of evidence and involvement of both the Japanese and Korean points of view. According to the , the king of Baekje gifted Jingū a Seven-Branched Sword sometime in 253 AD. Empress Jingū was the de facto ruler until her death in 269 at the age of 100. The modern traditional view is that Chūai&#x27;s son (&quot;Homutawake&quot;) became the next Emperor after Jingū acted as a regent. She would have been de facto ruler in the interim.

==Known information==
Empress consort Jingū is regarded by historians as a legendary figure, as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The lack of this information has made her very existence open to debate. If Empress Jingū was an actual figure, investigations of her tomb suggest she may have been a regent in the late 4th century AD or late 5th century AD.

There is no evidence to suggest that the title tennō was used during the time to which Jingū&#x27;s regency has been assigned. It is certainly possible that she was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity she ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name &quot;Jingū&quot; was more than likely assigned to her posthumously by later generations; during her lifetime she would have been called &quot;Okinaga-Tarashi&quot; respectively. Empress Jingū was later removed from the imperial lineage during the reign of Emperor Meiji as a way of making sure the lineage remained unbroken. This occurred when examining the emperors of the Northern Court and Southern Court of the fourteenth century. Focus was given on who should be the &quot;true&quot; ancestors of those who occupied the throne.

=== Gosashi kofun ===
While the actual site of Jingū&#x27;s grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a &quot;kofun&quot;-type Imperial tomb in Nara. This kofun is also known as the &quot;Gosashi tomb&quot;, and is managed by the Imperial Household Agency. The tomb was restricted from archaeology studies in 1976 as the tomb dates back to the founding of a central Japanese state under imperial rule. The Imperial Household Agency had also cited &quot;tranquility and dignity&quot; concerns in making their decision. Serious ethics concerns had been raised in 2000 after a massive archaeological hoax was exposed. Things changed in 2008 when Japan allowed limited access to Jingū&#x27;s kofun to foreign archaeologists, who were able to determine that the tomb likely dated to the 4th century AD. The examination also discovered haniwa terracotta figures. Empress Jingū is also enshrined at Sumiyoshi-taisha in Osaka, which was established in the 11th year of her reign (211 AD).

==Controversy==
===Birth of Ōjin and Jingū&#x27;s Identity===
According to the &quot;Kiki&quot;, Empress Jingū gave birth to a baby boy whom she named &quot;Homutawake&quot; (aka Emperor Ōjin) following her return from Korean conquest. The legend alleges that her son was conceived but unborn when Emperor Chūai died. As three more years would pass before &quot;Homutawake&quot; was finally born, this claim appears to be mythical and symbolic rather than real. Scholar William George Aston has suggested that this claim was misinterpreted, and instead refers to a period of less than nine months containing three &quot;years&quot; (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If Ōjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested years of 270 to 310 AD.

Jingū&#x27;s identity has since been questioned by medieval and modern scholars whom have put forward different theories. Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293–1354) and Arai Hakuseki (1657–1725) asserted that she was actually the shaman-queen Himiko. The kiki does not include any mentions of &quot;Queen Himiko&quot;, and the circumstances under which these books were written is a matter of unending debate. Even if such a person was known to the authors of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, they may have intentionally decided not to include her. However, they do include imperial-family shamans identified with her which include Jingū. Modern scholars such as Naitō Torajirō have stated that Jingū was actually Yamatohime-no-mikoto and that Wa armies obtained control of southern Korea. Yamatohime-no-Mikoto supposedly founded the Ise Shrine in tribute to the sun-goddess Amaterasu. While historian Higo Kazuo suggested that she is a daughter of Emperor Kōrei (Yamatototohimomosohime-no-Mikoto).

===Korean Invasion===


Both the and the give accounts of how Okinaga-Tarashi (Jingū) led an army to invade a &quot;promised land&quot; (sometimes interpreted as lands on the Korean Peninsula). She then returned to Japan victorious after three years of conquest where she was proclaimed as Empress. The second volume of the (中巻 or &quot;Nakatsumaki&quot;) states that the Korean kingdom of Baekje (百済 or &quot;Kudara&quot;) paid tribute to Japan under &quot;Tribute from Korea&quot;. The states that Jingū conquered a region in southern Korea in the 3rd century AD naming it &quot;Mimana&quot;. One of the main proponents of this theory was Japanese scholar Suematsu Yasukazu, who in 1949 proposed that Mimana was a Japanese colony on the Korean peninsula that existed from the 3rd until the 6th century. The Chinese &quot;Book of Song&quot; of the Liu Song dynasty also allegedly notes the Japanese presence in the Korean Peninsula, while the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; says that Japan provided military support to Baekje and Silla.

In 1883, a memorial stele for the tomb of King Gwanggaeto (374 – 413) of Goguryeo was discovered and hence named the Gwanggaeto Stele. An issue arose though, when the inscriptions describing events during the king&#x27;s reign were found to be in bad condition with portions illegible. At the center of the disagreement is the &quot;sinmyo passage&quot; of year 391 as it can be interpreted in multiple ways. Korean scholars maintain that it states the Goguryeo subjugated Baekje and Silla, while Japanese scholars have traditionally interpreted that Wa had at one time subjugated Baekje and Silla. The stele soon caught the interest of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, who obtained a rubbed copy from its member Kageaki Sakō in 1884. They particularly became intrigued over the passage describing the king&#x27;s military campaigns for the &quot;sinmyo&quot; in 391 AD. Additional research was done by some officers in the Japanese army and navy, and the rubbed copy was later published in 1889. The interpretation was made by Japanese scholars at the time that the &quot;Wa&quot; had occupied and controlled the Korean Peninsula. The legends of Empress Jingū&#x27;s conquest of Korea could have then been used by Imperial Japan as reasoning for their annexation of Korea in 1910 as &quot;restoring&quot; unity between the two countries. As it was, imperialists had already used this historical claim to justify expansion into the Korean Peninsula.

The main issue with an invasion scenario is a lack of evidence of Jingū&#x27;s rule in Korea, or the existence of Jingū as an actual historical figure. This suggests that the accounts given are either fictional or an inaccurate/misleading account of events that occurred. According to the book &quot;From Paekchae Korea to the Origin of Yamato Japan&quot;, the Japanese had misinterpreted the Gwanggaeto Stele. The Stele was a tribute to a Korean king, but because of a lack of correct punctuation, the writing can be translated in 4 different ways. This same Stele can also be interpreted as saying Korea crossed the strait and forced Japan into subjugation, depending on where the sentence is punctuated. An investigation done by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2006 suggested that the inscription could also be interpreted as &quot;Silla and Baekje were dependent states of Yamato Japan.&quot;

The imperialist reasoning for occupation eventually led to an emotional repulsion from Jingu after World War II had ended as she had symbolized Japan&#x27;s nationalistic foreign policy. Historian Chizuko Allen notes that while these feelings are understandable, they are not academically justifiable. The overall popularity of the Jingū theory has been declining since the 1970s due to concerns raised about available evidence.

==Legacy==
In 1881, Empress Jingū became the first woman to be featured on a Japanese banknote. As no actual images of this legendary figure are known to exist, the representation of Jingū which was artistically contrived by Edoardo Chiossone is entirely conjectural; Chiossone used a female employee of the Government Printing Bureau as his model for Jingū. This picture was also used for 1908/14 postage stamps, the first postage stamps of Japan to show a woman. A revised design by Yoshida Toyo was used for the 1924/37 Jingū design stamps. The usage of a Jingū design ended with a new stamp series in 1939.

Excluding the legendary Empress Jingū, there were eight reigning empresses and their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women&#x27;s reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.

<text>Julio Iglesias Jr. (born Julio José Iglesias Preysler; 25 February 1973) is a Spanish singer-songwriter.

==Early life==
Julio Iglesias Jr. was born Julio José Iglesias Preysler in Madrid, Spain, the son of Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and Filipina socialite Isabel Preysler. He is the younger brother of Chabeli Iglesias and the older brother of Enrique Iglesias. His parents divorced in 1979. Iglesias Jr. and his siblings moved to Miami to live with their father. Iglesias Jr. went to college near San Francisco at Menlo College in Atherton, California. He won a chance to participate in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and he worked for the Travel Channel, where he hosted a travel show that took him to Latin America.

==Career==
Iglesias Jr., with the help of his friend and manager Darius Jordi Lassus, first got into show business as a model. It was his manager that negotiated an exclusive male modeling agreement with Joey Hunter (at the time he was the president of the Male Model division) at the Ford Models Agency in New York. It was through Joey Hunter, that Iglesias Jr. was discovered by photographer Bruce Weber. He went on to campaign for Versace. Shortly after, Iglesias Jr. signed on with publicity executive Ruben Malaret who began a press campaign to further gain exposure of Iglesias Jr. to the English speaking entertainment industry. Some of his notable accomplishments was his participation on Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s talk show and was featured in an advertisement for Gap and he modeled for designer John Bartlett VII on Sixth Fashion Show.

He was offered two soap opera jobs, one at Televisa and one in the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. Iglesias Jr. also received an offer from the Producers of the Broadway show Grease to star as Danny, but decided to turn down these job offers because he wanted to focus on his music. Iglesias Jr. signed a recording agreement with Epic Records and he traveled to Miami where he began to record his first album, &quot;Under My Eyes&quot;, with Rodolfo Castillo. Released in 1999, the recording of this album took them to New York City and Los Angeles, two songs released from this English language album are &quot;One More Chance&quot; and &quot;Under My Eyes&quot;. Among promotional appearances for the album, Iglesias Jr. performed &quot;One More Chance&quot; at the Miss Universe 1999 Pageant and opened for Cher on her tour of North America. The album failed to gain success in the United States and soon after Iglesias Jr. departed from Epic Records.

Iglesias Jr&#x27;s. second album, &quot;Tercera Dimension&quot;, was released in 2003 on the Warner Music Group and featured Spanish pop rock songs with the singles &quot;Los Demas&quot; and &quot;Dejame Volar&quot;. Both albums received public interest from the Hispanic media in the United States but attained minority success.

He worked for Hola Magazine, appearing in several photoshoots. More recently he has taken part in a series in Spain called &quot;Club de Flo&quot;, in which Spanish politicians and celebrities have to present a comedy routine. The show was unsuccessful and cancelled after several episodes. He has moved back to Spain and is living with his mother Isabel Preysler. He appeared on the Spanish version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; called &quot;¡Mira quien baila!&quot; but was voted out in the thirteenth week. He has played the lead role in a drama film entitled &quot;The Music of You&quot; directed by Lloyd DeSouza.

In 2008, Iglesias Jr. was the winner of the first season of CMT reality Television show &quot;Gone Country,&quot; in which artists from other genres of music lived together in a house in Nashville and competed to win a country music contract. His single &quot;The Way I Want You&quot; was released to country radio on 10 March 2008 and was produced by &quot;Gone Country&quot; host John Rich. Iglesias Jr. also appeared on the ABC TV show &quot;the superstars&quot;. He was partnered with soccer player Brandi Chastain; they finished in fourth place in the competition.

In 2014, he joined the band &quot;Latin Lovers&quot; with Nuno Resende and Damien Sargue.

In 2015, he performed a concert (complete show) for the first time with his father Julio Iglesias in a tour in Romania, on 22 May at Sala Polivalentă in Cluj-Napoca and 2 July at Sala Palatului in the capital Bucharest.

==Personal life==
Iglesias is a Catholic and descendant of the religious Filipino-Spanish clan Arrastia from the Arrastia family of Lubao, Pampanga the Philippines.

In October 1999, he legally changed his name from Julio José Iglesias to Julio Iglesias Jr. 

In May 2011, Iglesias Jr. became engaged to Belgian model Charisse Verhaert (born 1982) after 7 years of dating. The religious wedding took place on 3 November 2012 in Aldea del Fresno, Spain. In August 2020, a petition for divorce was filed in the Miami Court. 

From October 2022 to July 2023, Iglesias Jr. was in a relationship with Brazilian model Vivi Di Domenico who is twenty years his junior. In August 2023, he revealed that he is dating Cuban-Italian model Ariadna Romero.

<doc id="318185" wikidata="Q734298" url="?curid=318185" title="George Bass">
<text>George Bass (; 30 January 1771 – after 5 February 1803) was a British naval surgeon and explorer of Australia.

==Early life==
Bass was born on 30 January 1771 at Aswarby, a hamlet near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, the son of a tenant farmer, George Bass, and a local beauty named Sarah (née Newman). His father died in 1777 when Bass was six. He had attended Boston Grammar School and later trained in medicine at the hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire. At the age of 18, he was accepted in London as a member of the Company of Surgeons, and in 1794 he joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon.

==Career==
He arrived in Sydney in New South Wales on HMS &quot;Reliance&quot; on 7 September 1795.

Also on the voyage were Matthew Flinders, John Hunter, Bennelong, and his surgeon&#x27;s assistant William Martin.

==The voyages of the Tom Thumb and Tom Thumb II==
Bass had brought with him on the &quot;Reliance&quot; a small boat with an keel and beam, which he called the Tom Thumb on account of its size. In October 1795 Bass and Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed the Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River further upstream than had been done previously by the colonists. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks&#x27; Town.

In March 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a larger boat, which they called the Tom Thumb II. During this trip they travelled as far down the coast as Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They explored Port Hacking.

Later that year Bass discovered good land near Prospect Hill, found lost cattle brought out with the First Fleet, and failed in an attempt to cross the Blue Mountains.

==Whaleboat voyage to Western Port==
In 1797, without Flinders, in an open whaleboat with a crew of six, Bass sailed to Cape Howe, the farthest point of south-eastern Australia. From here he went westwards along what is now the coast of the Gippsland region of Victoria, to Western Port, almost as far as the entrance to Port Phillip, on the north shore of which is the site of present-day Melbourne. His belief that a strait separated the mainland from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) was backed up by his astute observation of the rapid tide and the long south-western swell at Wilson&#x27;s Promontory.

Bass visited the Kiama area and made many notes on its botanical complexity and the amazing natural phenomenon, the Kiama Blowhole, noting the volcanic geology around the Blowhole and contributed much to its understanding.

==Circumnavigation of Tasmania in the &quot;Norfolk&quot;==
In 1798, this theory was confirmed when Bass and Flinders, in the sloop &quot;Norfolk&quot;, circumnavigated Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In the course of this voyage Bass visited the estuary of the Derwent River, found and named by Captain John Hayes in 1793, where the city of Hobart would be founded on the strength of his report in 1803. When the two returned to Sydney, Flinders recommended to Governor John Hunter that the passage between Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and the mainland be called Bass Strait.

&quot;This was no more than a just tribute to my worthy friend and companion,&quot; Flinders wrote, &quot;for the extreme dangers and fatigues he had undergone, in first entering it in a whaleboat, and to the correct judgement he had formed, from various indications, of the existence of a wide opening between Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and New South Wales.&quot;

Bass was an enthusiastic naturalist and botanist, and he forwarded some of his botanical discoveries to Sir Joseph Banks in London. &quot;In this voyage of fourteen weeks I collected those few plants upon Van Diemen&#x27;s Land which had not been familiar to me in New South Wales,&quot; he wrote to Banks, &quot;and have done myself the honour of submitting them to your inspection.&quot; He was made an honorary member of the Society for Promoting Natural History, which later became the Linnean Society. Some of his observations were published in the second volume of David Collins&#x27;s &quot;An Account of the English colony in New South Wales.&quot; He was one of the first to describe the Australian marsupial, the wombat.

==Marriage and trading==
On 8 October 1800, George married Elizabeth Waterhouse at St James&#x27;s Church, Westminster. She was the sister of Henry Waterhouse, Bass&#x27;s former shipmate, and captain of the &quot;Reliance&quot;. In January 1801 Bass set sail again for Port Jackson, leaving Elizabeth behind, and though the couple wrote to each other, they did not meet again, as Bass never returned from this journey.

Bass and a syndicate of friends had invested some £10,000 in the copper-sheathed brig , and a cargo of general goods to transport and sell in Port Jackson. Bass was the owner-manager and set sail in early 1801. (Among his influential friends and key business associates in the Antipodes was the principal surgeon of the satellite British colony on Norfolk Island, Thomas Jamison, who was subsequently appointed Surgeon-General of New South Wales.)

On passing through Bass Strait on his 1801 voyage, he recorded it simply as Bass Strait, like any other geographical feature. It seems, as Flinders&#x27; biographer Ernest Scott observed, that Bass&#x27;s natural modesty meant he felt no need to say &quot;discovered by me&quot; or &quot;named after me&quot;.

On arrival, Bass found the colony awash with goods and he was unable to sell his cargo. Governor King was operating on a strict programme of economy and would not take the goods into the government store, even at a 50% discount. What King did though was contract with Bass to ship salt pork from Tahiti. Food was scarce in Sydney at that time and prices were being driven up, yet pigs were plentiful in the Society Islands and King could contract with Bass at 6 pence a pound where he&#x27;d been paying a shilling (12 pence) previously. The arrangement suited King&#x27;s thrift, and was profitable for Bass. With his partner Charles Bishop, Bass sailed from Sydney in the &quot;Venus&quot; for Dusky Sound in New Zealand where they spent 14 days stripping iron from the wreck of Captain Brampton&#x27;s old ship the &quot;Endeavour&quot;. This was made into axes which were used to trade for the pork in Tahiti before returning with the latter to Sydney by November 1802.

In January 1803, Bass applied to King for a fishing monopoly extending from a line bisecting the lower South Island of New Zealand from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour – now the site of the city of Dunedin – and including all the lands and seas to the south, notably the Antipodes Islands, probably on the basis of information from his brother-in-law Waterhouse, the discoverer of the Antipodes archipelago. He expected much from it, but before he heard it had been declined he sailed south from Sydney never to return. Bass and Flinders were both operating out of Sydney during these times, but their stays there did not coincide.

==Final voyage==

What became of Bass is unknown. He set sail on his last voyage in the &quot;Venus&quot; on 5 February 1803 and he and his crew were never seen again. His plan was to go to Tahiti and perhaps on to the Spanish colonies on the coast of Chile to buy provisions and bring them back to Sydney.

It has been suspected Bass may also have planned to engage in contraband trade in Chile. Spain reserved the import of goods into her colonies for Spanish ships and Spanish merchants, but the colonists needed more than they could supply, and shortages and heavy taxation caused high prices, encouraging an extensive illegal trade with foreign vessels. Port Jackson was described by some 19th-century historians as a base for such smuggling Britain&#x27;s strained relationship with Spain at that time meant British authorities were unconcerned.

Bass still had much of the general cargo he had brought to Sydney in 1801, and he may well have been tempted to take some to Chile. Two of his last letters have hints at a venture which he could not name, but in any case he set off in 1803, with a diplomatic letter from Governor King attesting his bona-fides and that his sole purpose, if he were on the West coast of South America, would be in procuring provisions.

As many months passed with no word of his arrival, Governor King and Bass&#x27;s friends in Sydney were forced to accept that he had met some misfortune. In England in January 1806, Bass was listed by the Admiralty as lost at sea, and later that year Elizabeth was granted an annuity from the widows&#x27; fund, backdated to when Bass&#x27;s half-pay had ended in June 1803. Bass had made the usual contributions to the fund from his salary.

==Speculation on Bass&#x27;s fate==

A good deal of speculation has taken place about Bass&#x27;s fate. One story, attributed to William Campbell of the brig &quot;Harrington&quot;, has it that Bass was captured by the Spanish in Chile and sent to the silver mines. The &quot;Harrington&quot; was engaged in smuggling and returned to Sydney some three months after Bass&#x27;s departure. However, this story dates from 1811 in a report by William Fitzmaurice. There are good records of Campbell in 1803, and then in 1805 when he captured a Spanish ship, but Bass is not mentioned at those times. Three months is also too short a time for Bass to reach Chile and then the &quot;Harrington&quot; to get back to Sydney.

Another factor against the South American story is that all British prisoners held by the Spanish in Chile and Peru were freed in 1808 and returned to Europe. If the crew of the &quot;Venus&quot; had indeed been captured, then none of the 25 survived.

Adventurer Jørgen Jørgensen wrote about Bass in his 1835 autobiography, claiming Bass had attempted forced trade at gunpoint in Chile, and was captured when he let his guard down. Jørgensen probably met Bass, but this account is almost certainly an invention. Jørgensen&#x27;s writing, though entertaining, was often far from factual.

A search of Spanish archives in 1903 by scholar Pascual de Gayangos and a search of Peruvian archives in 2003 by historian Jorge Ortiz-Sotelo found no mention of Bass. His ultimate fate remains a mystery.

==Recognition==
Australia Post honoured George Bass in 1963 with a postage stamp, and again in 1998 in association with Matthew Flinders.

A re-enactment of the whaleboat voyage marked the 200th anniversary of Bass&#x27;s voyage; the &quot;Elizabeth&quot; skippered by Bern Cuthbertson arrived at Western Port on 5 January 1998. A plaque memorialising this was added to the Bass and Flinders memorial at Flinders.

The following places commemorate the name of George Bass:
* Bass Highway (Tasmania)
* Bass Highway (Victoria)
* Bass Hill, New South Wales
* Bass Point
* Bass Strait
* Bass River
* Bass, Victoria (town)
* Division of Bass, Tasmania (federal)
* Division of Bass, Tasmania (state)
* Bass and Flinders Point, Cronulla, New South Wales

<doc id="318189" wikidata="Q2517793" url="?curid=318189" title="Sean Reinert">
<text>Sean Landon Reinert (May 27, 1971 – January 24, 2020) was an American musician. He was the drummer for the rock band Æon Spoke and the drummer and cofounder of the progressive metal band Cynic along with Paul Masvidal until leaving the band in September 2015.

== Career ==
In 1991, Reinert and Paul Masvidal (also of Cynic) joined the band Death to record the &quot;Human&quot; album. This album is seen by many as the start of the technical death metal genre. After touring with Death, he returned to Cynic.

1993 saw the release of &quot;Focus&quot; (regarded as a landmark release in the field of technical/progressive metal) on the Roadrunner Records label. Roadrunner re-released it in 2005 as a special collector&#x27;s edition due to high demand. After Cynic&#x27;s disbandment Reinert had been a member of the Cynic spin-off band Portal which released a demo but eventually disbanded. Having relocated to Los Angeles, Reinert continued working with music by writing and performing for television shows and motion pictures.

In 1999, Reinert helped form Æon Spoke alongside Masvidal, which is described as an &quot;ethereal rock&quot; band. The band saw releases in 2004 and 2007, receiving national and satellite airplay, performing, hosting radio appearances, and even appearing on television show and motion picture soundtracks.

During this time in 2006, it was announced that Cynic would reform for a tour which took place in the summer of 2007. The reformed lineup then recorded a follow-up to &quot;Focus&quot; entitled &quot;Traced in Air&quot;, which was released in 2008 and followed by more touring. In 2009, a new EP with Cynic was recorded scheduled for release in May 2010.

As of May 2014, he publicly revealed his homosexuality along with fellow Cynic member Paul Masvidal.

Reinert died on January 24, 2020, due to an aortic rupture.

== Legacy and influence ==
Reinert credited Kenny Clarke, John Bonham, Neil Peart, Gary Husband and Vinnie Colaiuta as being important influences during his formative years.

Many artists have cited Reinert as an influence, including Peter Wildoer of Darkane, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, Gene Hoglan, Richard Christy, Dirk Verbeuren of Soilwork and Megadeth, Chris Pennie of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Coheed and Cambria, George Kollias of Nile, John Merryman of Cephalic Carnage, Daniel Moilanen of Katatonia, Elliot Hoffman of Car Bomb, Evan Sammons of Last Chance to Reason, and Mario Duplantier of Gojira.

In addition, other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for his work including Mike Portnoy Hannes Grossmann, Kai Hahto of Nightwish, Dan Presland of Ne Obliviscaris, and Danny Walker of Intronaut.

<doc id="318190" wikidata="Q1387704" url="?curid=318190" title="Sir George Thomas, 7th Baronet">
<text>Sir George Alan Thomas, 7th Baronet (14 June 1881 – 23 July 1972) was a British badminton, tennis and chess player. He was twice British chess champion and a 21-time All-England badminton champion. He also reached the quarterfinals of the singles and the semifinals of the men&#x27;s tennis doubles at Wimbledon in 1911. Badminton&#x27;s world men&#x27;s team championships cup, equivalent to tennis&#x27; Davis Cup, is named Thomas Cup after him. Thomas lived most of his life in London and Godalming. He never married, so the hereditary Thomas baronetcy ended on his death.

==Badminton==

Counting both singles and doubles titles, Thomas is the most successful player ever in the All England Open Badminton Championships, considered the unofficial World Badminton Championships, with 21 titles from 1903 to 1928. Four of those titles were in men&#x27;s singles (consecutive titles from 1920 to 1923), nine in men&#x27;s doubles and eight in mixed doubles. He won his titles both before and after a hiatus in the competition from 1915 to 1919 due to World War I.

He was part of the English team that toured Canada in 1925 to promote the sport on behalf of the Canadian Badminton Association which had recently been formed in 1921. He captained the team again when a second tour was organised during 1930. A match was held at the Granite Club in Toronto which England won 7–2.

In 1934 he was co-founder of the International Badminton Federation (now Badminton World Federation), of which he was president from 1934 to 1955.

Inspired by tennis&#x27; Davis Cup, first held in 1900, and football&#x27;s World Cup, first held in 1930, Thomas had the idea of organizing an international competition for country teams in badminton. In 1939 his idea was well received at the general meeting of the International Badminton Federation. In the same year, Sir George presented the Thomas Cup, officially known as &quot;The International Badminton Championship Challenge Cup&quot;, produced by &quot;Atkin Bros of London&quot; at a cost of £1700. The Cup stands 28 inches in height and 16 inches across at its widest, and consists of three parts: a plinth (pedestal), a bowl, and a lid with a player figure. The first tournament was originally planned for 1941–42, but due to World War II was not realized until 1948–49, when ten national teams participated in the first Thomas Cup competition. Despite its British origins, England&#x27;s best finish in the Thomas Cup has been a third place in 1984.

Thomas was inducted into the World Badminton Hall of Fame as an Inaugural Member in 1996.

==Chess==

Thomas was British Chess Champion in 1923 and 1934. He shared first prize at the 1934/5 Hastings International Chess Congress with the next world chess champion Max Euwe and leading Czechoslovak player Salo Flohr, ahead of past and future world champions José Raúl Capablanca and Mikhail Botvinnik, whom he defeated in their individual games. For Capablanca, this had been the first loss in tournament play for four years, and the first playing the white pieces for more than six years. Also in Hastings, eleven years later, Euwe would become the third world chess champion to be defeated by Thomas in a game.

His &#x27;lifetime&#x27; scores against the world&#x27;s elite were however less flattering: he had minuses against Emanuel Lasker (−1, not counting a win in a Lasker simultaneous exhibition in 1896), José Raúl Capablanca (+1−5=3), Alexander Alekhine (−7=6), Efim Bogoljubov (−5=3), Euwe (+1−9=2), Flohr (+2−9=4) and Savielly Tartakower (+3−9=10). He also fared badly against Edgard Colle (+1−9=8). Thomas made even scores with Botvinnik (+1−1), Richard Réti (+3−3=1) and Siegbert Tarrasch (+1−1=3). Against Géza Maróczy, the balance was in Thomas&#x27; favour (+3−1=5).

Domestically, he held a plus score against his great rival Frederick Yates (+13−11=13), but was less successful against Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion Vera Menchik (+7−8=7),

In 1950 he was awarded the International Master title by FIDE and in 1952, became an International Arbiter. He gave up competitive chess at the age of 69.

<text>Chamrosh (Persian: چمروش) is a bird in Persian mythology said to live on the summit of Mount Alborz, Iran.

Chamrosh is described as having the body of a dog/wolf with the head and wings of an eagle. It was said to inhabit the ground beneath the soma tree that was the roost of the Senmurv. When the Senmurv descended or alighted from its roost, all the ripened seeds fell to the earth. These seeds were gathered by the Chamrosh, which then distributed them to other parts of the earth. There is a description of the Chamrosh in the Persian Rivayats: &quot;The Creator Ohrmazd has produced on the shores of the sea Vourukasha a tree and two birds who are immortal and without death. Every year a thousand new branches spring up from that tree and all kinds of seeds hang on those branches and all those seeds become ripe. A bird called Amrosh comes and sits on one of the branches and shakes it and scatters down to the ground all the seeds. Another bird called Chamrosh comes and strikes all the seeds with its wings and sides and throws them into the sea. All those seeds go inside a cloud full of rain and that cloud rains on the ground and all the seeds appear on the earth.&quot;

Chamrosh is the archetype of all birds, said to rule and protect all avifauna on Earth. According to the Avesta, Persia is pillaged every three years by outsiders, and when this happens, the angel Burj sends Chamrosh out to fly onto the highest mountaintop then snatch the pillagers in its talons as a bird does corn.

Jewish mythology sometimes equates the Chamrosh with the giant bird Ziz.

<doc id="318200" wikidata="Q186154" url="?curid=318200" title="Giraffidae">
<text>The Giraffidae are a family of ruminant artiodactyl mammals that share a recent common ancestor with deer and bovids. This family, once a diverse group spread throughout Eurasia and Africa, presently comprises only two extant genera, the giraffe (between one and eight, usually four, species of &quot;Giraffa&quot;, depending on taxonomic interpretation) and the okapi (the only known species of &quot;Okapia&quot;). Both are confined to sub-Saharan Africa: the giraffe to the open savannas, and the okapi to the dense rainforest of the Congo. The two genera look very different on first sight, but share a number of common features, including a long, dark-coloured tongue, lobed canine teeth, and horns covered in skin, called ossicones.

==Taxonomy==
===Evolutionary background===
The giraffids are ruminants of the clade Pecora. Other extant pecorans are the families Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Cervidae (deer), Moschidae (musk deer), and Bovidae (cattle, goats and sheep, wildebeests and allies, and antelopes). The exact interrelationships among the pecorans have been debated, mainly focusing on the placement of Giraffidae, but a recent large-scale ruminant genome sequencing study suggests Antilocapridae are the sister taxon to Giraffidae, as shown in the cladogram below.

The ancestors of pronghorn diverged from the giraffids in the Early Miocene. This was in part of a relatively late mammal diversification following a climate change that transformed subtropical woodlands into open savannah grasslands.

The fossil record of giraffids and their stem-relatives is quite intensive, with fossil of these taxa include Gelocidae, Palaeomerycidae, Prolibytheridae, and Climacoceratidae. It is thought that the palaeomerycids, prolibytherids, climacoceratids and the giraffids all form a clade of pecorans known as Giraffomorpha. The relationship between the climacoceratids and giraffids is supported by the presence of a bilobed canine, and have been postulated into two hypotheses. One is the climacoceratids were the ancestors of the sivatheres, as both groups were large, deer-like giraffoids with branching antler-like ossicones, while an extinct basal group of giraffoids, canthumerycines, evolved into the ancestors of Giraffidae. Another more commonly supported hypothesis is climacoceratids were merely the sister clade to giraffids, with sivatheres being either basal giraffids or descended from a lineage that also includes the okapi. While the current range of giraffids today is in Africa, the fossil record of the group has shown this family was once widespread throughout of Eurasia.

Below is the phylogenetic relationships of giraffomorphs after Solounias (2007), Sánchez et al. (2015) and Ríos et al. (2017):

==Characteristics==

The giraffe stands tall, with males taller than females. The giraffe and the okapi have characteristic long necks and long legs. Ossicones are present on males and females in the giraffe, but only on males in the okapi.

Giraffids share many common features with other ruminants. They have cloven hooves and cannon bones, much like bovids, and a complex, four-chambered stomach. They have no upper incisors or upper canines, replacing them with a tough, horny pad. An especially long diastema is seen between the front and cheek teeth. The latter are selenodont, adapted for grinding up tough plant matter. Like most other ruminants, the dental formula for giraffids is . Giraffids have prehensile tongues (specially adapted for grasping).

The extant giraffids, the forest-dwelling okapi and the savannah-living giraffe, have several features in common, including a pair of skin-covered horns, called ossicones, up to long (absent in female okapis); a long, black, prehensile tongue; lobed canine teeth; patterned coats acting as camouflage; and a back sloping towards the rear. The okapi&#x27;s neck is long compared to most ruminants, but not nearly so long as the giraffe&#x27;s. Male giraffes are the tallest of all mammals: their horns reach above the ground and their shoulder , whereas the okapi has a shoulder height of .

==Distribution==
The two extant genera are now confined to sub-Saharan Africa. The okapi is restricted to a small range in the northern rainforest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although the range of the giraffe is considerably larger, it once covered an area twice the present size – all parts of Africa that could offer an arid and dry landscape furnished with trees.

==Behavior==
The social structure and behavior is markedly different in okapis and giraffes, but although little is known of the okapi&#x27;s behavior in the wild, a few things are known to be present in both species:
* They have an ambling gait similar to camels, with their weight supported alternately by their left and right legs, while their necks maintain balance. Giraffes can run up to this way and are documented to have covered in the Sahel during the dry season.
* The dominance hierarchy, which has been well-documented among giraffes, has also been seen among captive okapis. An adult giraffe head can weigh , and if necessary, male giraffes establish a hierarchy among themselves by swinging their heads at each other, horns first, a behavior known as &quot;necking&quot;. A subordinate okapi signals submission by placing its head and neck on the ground.
Giraffes are sociable, whereas okapis live mainly solitary lives. Giraffes temporarily form herds of up to 20 individuals; these herds can be mixed or uniform groups of males and females, young and adults. Okapis are normally seen in mother-offspring pairs, although they occasionally gather around a prime food source. Giraffe are not territorial, but have ranges that can dramatically vary between –  – depending on food availability, whereas okapis have individual ranges about in size.
* Giraffes and okapis are normally silent, but both have a range of vocalizations, including coughing, snorting, moaning, hissing, and whistling. Giraffes have been suggested to be able to communicate using infrasonic sounds like elephants and blue whales.

<text>The national flag of Switzerland displays a white Greek cross in the center of a square red field. The white cross is known as the Swiss cross or the federal cross. Its arms are equilateral, and their ratio of length to width is 7:6. The size of the cross in relation to the field was set in 2017 as 5:8. Alongside the flag of Vatican City, the Swiss flag is one of only two square national flags in the world.

The white cross has been used as the field sign (attached to the clothing of combatants and to the cantonal war flags in the form of strips of linen) of the Old Swiss Confederacy since its formation in the late 13th or early 14th century. Its symbolism was described by the Swiss Federal Council in 1889 as representing &quot;at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy&quot;. As a national ensign, it was first used during the Napoleonic Wars by general Niklaus Franz von Bachmann, and as regimental flag of all cantonal troops from 1841. The federal coat of arms (&quot;eidgenössisches Wappen&quot;) was defined in 1815 for the Restored Confederacy as the white-on-red Swiss cross in a heraldic shield. The current design was used together with a cross composed of five squares until 1889, when its dimensions were officially set.

The civil and state ensign of Switzerland, used by Swiss ships, boats and non-governmental bodies, is rectangular in shape and has the more common proportions of 2:3. The emblem of the Red Cross is the Swiss flag with switched colours.

==Design==
According to the 2017 flag law (SR 232.21), &quot;the Swiss flag shows a Swiss cross on a square background&quot;. Special provisions are made for the naval ensign and for civil aircraft identification. The Swiss cross is defined as 
:&quot;a white, upright, free-standing cross depicted against a red background, whose arms, which are all of equal size, are one-sixth longer than they are wide.&quot;

Swiss Standard German consistently uses (cognate with &quot;vane&quot;) rather than the term used for national flags in Germany. The name of the flag of the Swiss Confederation is a nominal compound, .

The flag is emblazoned in English as, &quot;Gules, a cross coupée argent.&quot;

===Proportions===
While the proportions of the cross have been fixed since 1889, the size of the cross relative to the flag (the width of the margin separating the &quot;cross couped&quot; from the edge of the flag) had not been officially fixed prior to 2017.

The annex to the flag law provides an image specifying that the margin is to be of the same width as the cross arms, so that the total height of the cross is fixed at 20:32 = 5:8 of the height of the flag (in other words, the width of the margin is 6:32 = 3:16). This ratio is also given as a &quot;vexillological recommendation&quot; in the flag regulation used by the Swiss Armed Forces. Flags with a cross of larger relative widths than the prescribed 20:32 = 62.5% remain in wide use; common ratios include 20:26 ≈ 76.9% 
and 20:28 ≈ 71.4%.

For the ensign, the ratio of the size of the cross to the height is likewise 5:8, so that the ratio of cross to flag width is 5:12.

===Colors===

The shade of red used in the flag was not defined by law prior to 2017. Since then, the colour of the flag is defined as pure red, with the color values as follows:

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The ultimate origin of the white cross is attributed by three competing legends: to the Theban Legion, to the &quot;Reichssturmfahne&quot; (Imperial War Banner) attested from the 12th century, and to the &quot;Arma Christi&quot; that were especially venerated in the three forest cantons, and which they were allegedly allowed to display on the formerly uniformly red battle flag from 1289 by King Rudolph I of Habsburg at the occasion of a campaign to Besançon.

Use of a white cross as a mark of identification of the combined troops of the Old Swiss Confederacy is first attested in the Battle of Laupen (1339), where it was sewn on combatants&#x27; clothing as two stripes of textile, contrasting with the red St. George&#x27;s cross of Habsburg Austria, and with the St. Andrew&#x27;s cross used by Burgundy and Maximilian I.
The first flag used as a field sign representing the confederacy rather than the individual cantons may have been used in the Battle of Arbedo in 1422 (notably without the participation of the Canton of Schwyz). This was a triangular red flag with an elongated white cross.

The white cross was thus in origin a field mark attached to combatants for identification, and later also to cantonal flags.
The Lucerne chronicle of 1513, in battle scenes of the Burgundy wars of the 1470s shows cantonal flags with an added white cross.
In this context, the solid-red war flag of Schwyz with the addition of the white cross appears much like the later flag of Switzerland.
Other depictions in the illustrated chronicles show a flag of Schwyz with an asymmetrical white cross, drawn in greater detail.
The symbol of the confederation as it developed during 1450-1520 was thus the white cross itself, not necessarily in a red field, but attached to existing flags, so that it appeared before a red background in those cantonal flags that contained red, notably the solid-red flag of Schwyz.

===Early modern===

The first explicit mention of a separate flag representing the Confederacy dates to 1540, in the context of an auxiliary force sent by the Swiss to aid their associate, the city of Rottweil, in a feud against the lords of Landenberg.
The &quot;Tagsatzung&quot; decided that the Swiss auxiliaries sent to Rottweil should receive &quot;a red flag with a white upright cross&quot;.
The first mention of the term &quot;Confederate Cross&quot; (&quot;Eidgenossen Crütz&quot;) dates to 1533.

Because of the Swiss pledge of neutrality, there was no military conflict in which the Swiss confederate troops participated after 1540. Consequently, the confederate field sign fell out of use.
At the same time, the former field sign develops into a representation of the Confederacy during this time, without achieving the full status as official heraldic emblem.
The cross is shown as a symbol of the Swiss Confederacy on the &quot;Patenmedallie&quot; cast by Jacob Stampfer and given by the Confederacy as a baptismal gift to Princess Claude of France in 1547.
The cross appears on similar medals and on throughout the early modern period, but most symbolic depictions of the Confederacy in the 17th century do without the federal cross.

Beginning in the later 16th century, forces of the individual cantons adopted a type of flag which was based on a white cross design. These flags usually showed a white cross drawn to the edge of the field in front of a background striped in the respective cantonal colours. From this type, the &quot;flammé&quot; military flag develops in the 17th century, which also came to be used by Swiss mercenary regiments by the end of the 17th century.
The &quot;flammé&quot; design remained popular for military flags of the 18th and 19th centuries. A &quot;flammé&quot; flag was introduced as ordonnance for the Bernese troops in 1703.

===Napoleonic period and Restored Confederacy===


After the French invasion of Swiss territory in 1798 and the subsequent collapse of the Confederation, the authorities of the newly proclaimed Helvetic Republic confiscated all earlier flags, replacing them with a green-red-yellow tricolour. 
General Niklaus Franz von Bachmann used the white cross in a red field his campaigns of 1800 and 1815.
The term &quot;Schweizer-Fahne&quot; (later spelling &quot;Schweizerfahne&quot;) is in use for the flag from this time, 
recorded in a poem on the Battle of Näfels by one J. Hottinger published in 1808.
The Tagsatzung (Swiss Diet) re-introduced the white cross in the red field for the seal of the Confederacy in 1814.
The commission for drafting a federal constitution on 16 May 1814 recommended the adoption of a seal of the Confederacy based on the &quot;field sign of the old Swiss&quot;.
On 4 July 1815, the Diet accepted the design of the commission, adopted as the provisional seal
described as &quot;in the center, the federal red shield with the white cross as common federal heraldic emblem, surrounded by a simple circular Gothic ornament, on the outside of which the inscription &#x27;Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft&#x27; with the year number MDCCCXV, and in an outer circle all XXII cantonal coat of arms in circular fields, according to their federal order of precedence; around all, a simple wreath&quot;.

This decision remained in force after the formation of the federal state in 1848, as was recognized by the Federal Council in 1889.
As opposed to the definition of an official seal or coat of arms, it was not, at the time, usual to specify a &quot;national flag&quot;. 
However, the white cross in a red field had seen frequent use on flags flown by private organizations during the Regeneration period (1830s), especially shooting, singing and gymnastics associations which at the time were a pool for progressive or &quot;radical&quot; agitation.
The canton of Aargau introduced the flag for its troops in 1833.
General Guillaume-Henri Dufour proposed use of the flag for all federal forces in 1839.
The Tagsatzung on 2 September 1839 passed a resolution prescribing the use of a unified flag design for all cantonal infantry regiments. In a first circular sent to the cantonal authorities, the flag was described as a red flag with a cross touching the edges, but in 1841, the Tagsatzung opted for a proposal by Carl Stauffer, which was announced to the cantons on 11 October 1841. The 1841 flag shows a bold cross suspended in the center of the square field. The proportions of the cross arm are 1:1, i.e. the cross is composed of five squares. The absolute width of the flag is given as 4.5 feet (105 cm), that of the cross as 3 feet (90 cm),
for a ratio of cross to flag width of 2:3 ≈ 66.7% (as opposed to the modern 5:8 = 62.5%).

The specifications include the flag pole and the ribbon with the cantonal colours attached to the pole (the example depicted is the flag of the Zürich battalion). The flag itself is described as of good silk cloth, four feet five inches squared, scarlet, in the center a white cross, arms measuring one foot by three feet.

===Modern Switzerland===
The Swiss constitution of 1848 did not name a national flag, but it prescribes the federal flag for all federal troops.
The last &quot;flammé&quot; flags still used by &quot;Landwehr&quot; units were replaced by the modern design in 1865.
In November 1889, the Federal Council published a &quot;communication regarding the federal coat of arms&quot;, detailing the history of the use of the Swiss cross since the 15th century.

Seals produced from 1815 onward, and cantonal coins minted from 1826 showed the arms of the cross in the 7:6 length to width ratio. Later in the 19th century, there was a trend of depicting the cross as composed of five equal squares.
The two competing designs were controversially discussed in the late 19th century, especially after the introduction of the
new design for the five franks coin, which showed the Swiss coat of arms in a Baroque-style heraldic shield.
The Federal Council in 1889 introduced the 7:6 ratio as official. The associated communication explains that 
&quot;our heraldic cross is not a mathematical figure, but at the same the Christian cross symbol and the field sign of the Old Confederacy&quot;. The 1889 law explicitly avoids specification of the shape of the shield, which was to be left to the &quot;tastes of the current time and practical necessity&quot;.
The proposed legislation defining the Swiss federal coat of arms was passed on 12 December 1889 (SR 111).
The rectangular variant of the flag is used as a naval ensign only, officially introduced with a federal law passed 23 September 1953.

The current flag law of the Swiss Confederacy is the &quot;Wappenschutzgesetz&quot; (&quot;WSchG&quot;, SR 232.21) of 2013 (in force since 2017).
This law replaced the flag law of 1931 (last revised in 2008).
The 2013 law for the first time defines both the Swiss flag and the Swiss coat of arms based on an image, declared as authoritative in the text.

==Use in Switzerland==


===Private use===
The flag is flown around the year from private and commercial buildings as a display of patriotism, particularly in rural areas and often together with the cantonal and municipal flag. On Swiss National Day, 1 August, the streets and buildings are traditionally festooned in celebration with Swiss flags and banners.

Prominent display of the Swiss flag on clothing and apparel has become more frequent with the &quot;Swissness&quot; fashion trend in the first decade of the 21st century, while such use of the flag had previously been largely limited to conservative and right-wing circles. The flag and coat of arms are also often used (frequently in contravention of federal law, see below) as design elements on merchandise, particularly on high-quality goods or on merchandise aimed at tourists; for example, the emblem of Victorinox, manufacturer of Swiss Army knives and the sole purveyor of these knives to the Swiss army, is based on the Swiss coat of arms.

===Official use===
The display of the flag on federal, cantonal and municipal public buildings follows no uniform pattern or regulation. Many public buildings are equipped with flag posts (most often one each for the federal, cantonal and municipal flag), but the flag(s) may only be flown during part of the year or only on National Day. In Bern, the flag is flown on the cupola of the Federal Palace while the Federal Assembly is in session.

===Legal protection===
Destruction, removal or desecration of a Swiss, cantonal or municipal flag or coat of arms that has been installed by a public authority is punishable by a monetary penalty or imprisonment of up to three years according to the federal penal code.

The commercial use of the Swiss cross, Swiss flag or Swiss coat of arms was technically prohibited by the 1931 Federal Act for the protection of public coats of arms and other public insignia, but that prohibition was not enforced. Increasing commercial use of the Swiss coat of arms prompted a number of federal regulations, dubbed &quot;Swissness regulation&quot; (&quot;Swissness-Verordnung&quot;), in force since 2017. The &quot;Coat of Arms Protection Act&quot; of 2017 (&quot;Wappenschutzgesetz&quot;, &quot;Loi sur la protection des armoiries&quot;, SR 232.21) now prohibits the commercial use of the Swiss coat of arms (defined as &quot;a Swiss cross in a triangular shield&quot;). Use of the Swiss flag is generally permitted with the provision that such use &quot;is neither misleading nor contrary to public policy, morality or applicable law&quot;. Provisions are made for a &quot;right to continued use&quot; for trademarks registered before 2010.

==Influence==

The Red Cross symbol used by the International Committee of the Red Cross, a red cross on white background, was the original protection symbol declared at the first Geneva Convention, the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field of 1864. According to the ICRC the design was based on the Swiss flag by reversing of the colours of that flag, in order to honour Switzerland, where the first Geneva Convention was held, and its inventor and co-founder, the Swiss Henry Dunant.

The modern banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard was designed in 1912–14 by commander Jules Repond. The design has a Swiss cross design based on the 18th-century regimental flags of the Swiss Guards, with the papal coat of arms of the reigning pope in the upper hoist and the Della Rovere coat of arms of Julius II in the lower fly, and a vignette with the commander&#x27;s coat of arms in the centre.

<text>The African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), also known as Cape penguin or South African penguin, is a species of penguin confined to southern African waters. It is the only penguin found in the Old World. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh an average of and are tall. The species has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask. The body&#x27;s upper parts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band.

The African penguin is a pursuit diver and feeds primarily on fish and squid. Once extremely numerous, the African penguin is now the rarest species of penguin classified as critically endangered, with its population declining rapidly due to a combination of several threats. It is a charismatic species and is popular with tourists. Other vernacular names of the species include black-footed penguin and jackass penguin, due to the species&#x27; loud, donkey-like noise (although several related species of South American penguins produce the same sound). They can be found along the coast of South Africa and Namibia.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747, the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the African penguin in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Black-Footed Penguins&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on two preserved specimens that had been brought to London. He suspected that they had been collected near the Cape of Good Hope. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the African penguin with the wandering albatross in the genus &quot;Diomedea&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Diomedea demersa&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The African penguin is now placed with the banded penguins in the genus &quot;Spheniscus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name &quot;Spheniscus&quot; is from Ancient Greek word (&quot;sphēn&quot;) meaning &quot;wedge&quot; and is a reference to the animal&#x27;s thin, wedge-shaped flippers. The specific epithet &quot;demersus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;plunging&quot; (from &quot;demergere&quot; meaning &quot;to sink&quot;).

Banded penguins are found mainly in the temperate Southern Hemisphere, with the Humboldt penguin and Magellanic penguin found in southern South America and the Galápagos penguin found in the Pacific Ocean near the equator. All are similar in shape, colour and behaviour.

==Description==
African penguins grow to tall and weigh between . The beak length of the African penguin varies, usually growing between . They have a black stripe and black spots on the chest, the pattern of which is unique to each penguin, like human fingerprints. The sweat glands above the eyes cool the birds&#x27; blood and as the temperature rises, increased blood flow causes the glands to get pinker. This species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism; the males are slightly larger than the females and have longer beaks. Juveniles do not possess the bold, delineated markings of the adult, but instead have dark upperparts that vary from greyish-blue to brown; the pale underparts lack both spots and the band. The beak is more pointed than that of the Humboldt penguin. The African penguin&#x27;s colouring is a form of protective colouration known as countershading. The white undersides of the birds are difficult to spot by predators under the water and the penguins&#x27; black backs blend in with the water when viewed from above.

African penguins resemble and are related to the Humboldt, Magellanic and Galápagos penguins. African penguins have a very recognisable appearance, with a thick band of black that is in the shape of an upside-down horseshoe. They have black feet and black spots that vary in size and shape between individuals. Magellanic penguins share a similar bar marking that often confuses the two; the Magellanic has a double bar on the throat and chest, whereas the African has a single bar. These penguins are sometimes called &quot;jackass penguins&quot;, which comes from the loud braying noises they make.

==Distribution and habitat==
The African penguin is found on the southern and southwestern coast of Africa, living in colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa Bay, near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It is the only penguin species that breeds in Africa, and its presence gave name to the Penguin Islands.
Two colonies were established by penguins in the 1980s on the mainland near Cape Town, namely Boulders Beach near Simon&#x27;s Town and Stony Point in Betty&#x27;s Bay. Mainland colonies likely became possible only in recent times due to the reduction of predator numbers, although the Betty&#x27;s Bay colony has been attacked by leopards. The only other mainland colony is in Namibia, but it is not known when it was established.

Boulders Beach is a tourist attraction due to the beach, swimming and the penguins. The penguins will allow people to approach them as close as a meter.

Breeding populations of African penguins are being kept in numerous zoos worldwide. No colonies are known outside the southwestern coast of Africa, although vagrants (mostly juveniles) may occasionally be sighted beyond the normal range.

=== Population ===
Roughly 4 million African penguins existed at the beginning of the 19th century. Of the 1.5 million African penguins estimated in 1910, only some 10% remained at the end of the 20th century. African penguin populations, which breed in Namibia and South Africa, have declined by 95% since pre-industrial times.

Today, their breeding is largely restricted to 24 islands from Namibia to Algoa Bay, South Africa, with the Boulders Beach colony being an exception to this rule.

The total population fell to approximately 150,000–180,000 in 2000. Of those, 56,000 belonged to the Dassen Island colony and 14,000 to the Robben Island colony. The colony at Dyer Island in South Africa fell from 46,000 in the early 1970s to 3,000 in 2008.

In 2008, 5,000 breeding pairs were estimated to live in Namibia.

In 2010, the total African penguin population was estimated at 55,000. At the rate of decline seen from 2000 to 2010, the African penguin is expected to be extinct in the wild by 2026.

In 2012, about 18,700 breeding pairs were estimated to live in South Africa, with the majority on St. Croix Island in Algoa Bay.

The total breeding population across both South Africa and Namibia fell to a historic low of about 20,850 pairs in 2019.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
African penguins forage in the open sea, where they feed on pelagic fish such as sardines (including the blue pilchard), Cape horse mackerels, red-eye round herrings and anchovies (specifically the European anchovy and the Southern African anchovy) and marine invertebrates such as squids and small crustaceans, primarily krills and shrimps. Penguins normally swim within of the shore. A penguin may consume up to of prey every day, but this may increase to over when raising older chicks.

Due to the marked decline of sardines in the waters near its habitat, African penguins&#x27; diet has shifted towards anchovies to some extent, although available sardine biomass is still a notable determinant of penguin population development and breeding success. While a diet of anchovies appears to be generally sufficient for the penguins, it is not ideal due to anchovies&#x27; lower concentrations of fat and protein. The Penguin&#x27;s diet changes throughout the year; as in many seabirds, it is believed that the interaction of diet choice and breeding success helps the penguins maintain their population size. Although parent penguins are protective of their chicks, they will not incur nutritional deficits themselves if food is scarce and hunting requires a greater time or energy commitment. This may lead to higher rates of brood loss under poor food conditions.

When foraging, African penguins carry out dives that reach an average depth of and last for 69 seconds, although a maximum depth of and duration of 275 seconds has been recorded.

===Breeding===
The African penguin is monogamous; it breeds in colonies and pairs return to the same site each year. It has an extended breeding season, with nesting usually peaking from March to May in South Africa and November to December in Namibia. A clutch of two eggs is laid either in burrows burrowed in guano or nests in the sand under boulders or bushes. Incubation is undertaken equally by both parents for around 40 days. At least one parent guards the chicks for about one month, whereafter the chicks join a crèche with other chicks and both parents spend most of the day foraging in the sea.

Chicks fledge at 60 to 130 days, the timing depending on environmental factors such as the quality and availability of food. The fledged chicks then go to sea on their own, where they spend the next one to nearly two years. They then return to their natal colony to moult into adult plumage.

When penguins moult, they are unable to forage in the sea as their new feathers are not yet waterproof; therefore, they fast over the entire moulting period. African penguins typically take around three weeks to moult and lose about half of their body weight by burning up their fat reserves in the process.

African penguins spend most of their lives at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Females remain fertile for about 10 years. Due to high predation on the mainland, African penguins will seek protection on offshore islands, where they are safer from larger mammals and natural challenges. These penguins usually breed during the winter when temperatures are cooler. African penguins often will abandon their eggs if they become overheated in the hot sun and abandoned eggs never survive the heat. The eggs are three to four times bigger than chicken eggs. Ideally, the eggs are incubated in a burrow dug into the guano layer (which provides suitable temperature regulation), but the widespread human removal of guano deposits has rendered this type of nest unfeasible in many colonies. To compensate, penguins burrow holes in the sand, nest under rocks or bushes or make use of nest boxes if they are provided. The penguins spend three weeks on land caring for their offspring, after which chicks may be left alone during the day while the parents forage. The chicks are frequently killed by predators or succumb to the hot sun. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn.

In 2015, when foraging conditions were favourable, more male than female African penguin chicks were produced in the colony on Bird Island. Male chicks also had higher growth rates and fledging mass and therefore may have higher post-fledging survival than females. This, coupled with higher adult female mortality in this species, may result in a male-biased adult sex ratio and may indicate that conservation strategies focused on benefiting female African penguins may be necessary.

===Predation===
The average lifespan of an African penguin is 10 to around 25 years in the wild and up to 30 in captivity.

The primary predators of African penguins at sea include sharks and fur seals. Predators of nesting penguins and their chicks include kelp gulls, Cape genets, mongooses, caracals and domestic cats and dogs. Mortality from terrestrial predators is higher if penguins are forced to breed in the open, in the absence of suitable burrows or nest boxes.

==Threats and conservation==

===Historical exploitation===
African penguin eggs were considered a delicacy and were still being eaten and collected for sale as recently as the 1970s. In the 1950s, they were being collected from Dassen Island and sold in nearby towns. In 1953, 12,000 eggs were collected. In the late 1950s, some French chefs expressed interest in recipes including African penguin eggs collected from the islands off the west coast of South Africa and placed annual orders for small quantities. In the mid-1960s, eggs were collected in the thousands and sold by the dozen, with each customer limited to two dozen eggs in total.

The practice of collecting African penguin eggs involved smashing those found a few days before a collecting effort to ensure that only freshly laid eggs were sold. This added to the drastic decline of the African penguin population around the Cape coast, a decline which was hastened by the removal of guano from islands for use as fertiliser, eliminating the burrowing material used by penguins.

=== Oil spills ===
Penguins remain susceptible to pollution of their habitat by petrochemicals from spills, shipwrecks and cleaning of tankers while at sea. Accounts of African penguins impacted by oil date back to the 1930s. African penguins&#x27; exposure to oil spills is both chronic (higher frequency small discharges of oil at sea) and acute (rare maritime disasters where large volumes of oil are released in a single event). Penguins of many species have been impacted by oil spills across the southern hemisphere.

In 1948, the tanker &quot;Esso Wheeling&quot; sank, subsequently oiling and killing thousands of penguins of the Dyer Island colony. In 1953, dead penguins were among a range of dead birds, fish and other marine life that washed ashore after the tanker &quot;Sliedrecht&quot; was holed and spilled oil near Table Bay. In 1971, the SS &quot;Wafra&quot; oil spill impacted the African penguin colony of Dyer Island. In 1972, oil spilt following the &quot;Oswego-Guardian&quot; and &quot;Texanita&quot; collision oiled roughly 500 penguins. In 1975, newspapers reported that oil pollution from shipwrecks and the pumping of bilges at sea had killed tens of thousands of African penguins. At the time, the Dassen Island colony was being passed by 650 oil tankers each month because the Suez Canal had become blocked with wrecked vessels, thus increasing maritime traffic past the Cape of Good Hope.

In 1979, an oil spill prompted the collection and treatment of 150 African penguins from St. Croix Island near Port Elizabeth. The animals were later released at Robben Island and four of them promptly swam back to St. Croix Island, surprising scientists.

In 1983, the exposure of penguins of Dassen Island to the oil slick from the Castillo de Bellver was also a topic of concern given the penguins&#x27; conservation status at the time, but owing to the prevailing wind and current, only gannets were oiled.

==== 1994 MV &quot;Apollo Sea&quot; disaster ====
African penguin casualties were significant following the sinking of the MV &quot;Apollo Sea&quot; and a subsequent oil slick in 1994. 10,000 penguins were collected and cleaned, of which less than half survived.

==== 2000 MV &quot;Treasure&quot; crisis ====
Disaster struck on 23 June 2000, when the iron ore tanker MV &quot;Treasure&quot; sank between Robben Island and Dassen Island, South Africa. It released of fuel oil, causing an unprecedented coastal bird crisis and oiling 19,000 adult penguins at the height of the best breeding season on record for this vulnerable species. The oiled birds were brought to an abandoned train repair warehouse in Cape Town to be cared for. An additional 19,500 un-oiled penguins were removed from Dassen Island and other areas before they became oiled and were released about 800 kilometres east of Cape Town. This gave workers enough time to clean up the oiled waters and shores before the birds could complete their long swim home (which took the penguins between one and three weeks). Some of the penguins were named and radio-tracked as they swam back to their breeding grounds. Tens of thousands of volunteers helped with the rescue and rehabilitation process, which was overseen by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) and took more than three months to complete. This was the largest animal rescue event in history; more than 91% of the penguins were successfully rehabilitated and released – an amazing feat that could not have been accomplished without such a tremendous international response.

Due to the positive outcome of African penguins being raised in captivity after tragedies such as the &quot;Treasure&quot; oil spill, the species is considered a good &quot;candidate for a captive-breeding programme which aims to release offspring into the wild&quot;; however, worry about the spread of new strains of avian malaria is a major concern in the situation.

Bringing the birds inland led to the exposure of penguins to parasites and disease vectors such as mosquitoes carrying avian malaria, which has caused 27% of the rehabilitated penguin deaths annually.

==== 2016 &amp; 2019 Port of Ngqura ====
Small-scale oil spills (of less than ) have occurred at the Port of Ngqura since bunkering activities started there in 2016. Bunkering is a ship refuelling process that can result in oil spills and oil slicks entering the water. Hundreds of African penguins have been harmed following these spills due to the port&#x27;s close proximity to penguin rookeries on St. Croix Island and seabird habitat on neighbouring Jahleel and Brenton Islands.

=== Competition with fisheries ===
Commercial fisheries of sardines and anchovy, the two main prey species of the penguins, have forced these penguins to search for prey farther offshore, as well as having to switch to eating less nutritious prey. Restricting commercial fishing near colony sites such as Robben Island for short periods (3 years) was shown to markedly improve penguin breeding success. Longer closure periods and closures near other colonies are being evaluated.

===Conservation status===
The African penguin is one of the species to which the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) applies. In September 2010, it was listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. As of 2024, the African penguin is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, with the remaining mature individuals around 19,800 birds in a declining population.

===Mediation efforts===
Many organisations such as SANCCOB, Dyer Island Conservation Trust, SAMREC, The National Aviary in Pittsburgh, and Raggy Charters with the Penguin Research Fund in Port Elizabeth are working to halt the decline of the African penguin. Measures include: monitoring population trends, hand-rearing and releasing abandoned chicks, establishing artificial nests and proclaiming marine reserves in which fishing is prohibited. Some colonies (such as on Dyer Island) are suspected to be under heavy pressure from predation by Cape fur seals and may benefit from the culling of individual problem animals, which has been found effective (although requiring a large amount of management effort) in trials.

Established in 1968, SANCCOB is currently the only organisation mandated by the South African government to respond to crises involving seabirds along South Africa&#x27;s coastline and is internationally recognised for the role it played during the MV &quot;Treasure&quot; oil spill. A modelling exercise conducted in 2003 by the University of Cape Town&#x27;s FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology found that rehabilitating oiled African penguins has resulted in the current population being 19% larger than it would have been in the absence of SANCCOB&#x27;s rehabilitation efforts.

In February 2015, the Dyer Island Conservation Trust opened the African Penguin and Seabird Sanctuary (APSS) in Gansbaai, South Africa. The centre was opened by then-Department of Tourism minister Derek Hanekom and will serve as a hub for seabird research carried out by the Dyer Island Conservation Trust. The centre will also run local education projects, host international marine volunteers and seek to improve seabird handling techniques and rehabilitation protocols.

African penguins are a commonly seen species in zoos across the world. Because they do not require particularly low temperatures, they are often kept in outside enclosures. They adapt fairly well to this captive environment and are rather easy to breed compared to other species of the family. In Europe, the breeding programme EAZA is regulated by Artis Royal Zoo in the Netherlands, whilst in the United States the SSP programme is cooperatively managed by the AZA. The idea is to create a backup captive population, as well as to aid in the conservation of the population in its natural habitat. Between 2010 and 2013, American zoos spent $300,000 on &quot;in situ&quot; (wild population) conservation.

<doc id="318223" wikidata="Q864038" url="?curid=318223" title="Binot Paulmier de Gonneville">
<text>Binot Paulmier, sieur de Gonneville, French navigator of the early 16th century, was widely believed in 17th and 18th century France to have been the discoverer of the Terra Australis. Some history books from the French region of Normandy have taught that de Gonneville arrived in what is now Southern Brazil in 1504.

According to his published memories, in 1503 de Gonneville, challenging the Portuguese policy of mare clausum, sailed from Honfleur in Normandy with his crew and the help of two Portuguese pilots, heading for the East Indies. When he reached the Cape of Good Hope his ship &quot;L&#x27;Espoir&quot; (&quot;The Hope&quot;) was diverted to an &quot;unknown&quot; land by a storm. In 1505 he returned claiming to have discovered the &quot;great Austral land,&quot; which he also called the &quot;Indes Meridionales&quot;. According to de Gonneville, he had stayed six months in this idyllic place, where the inhabitants didn&#x27;t have to work because of the riches. De Gonneville stated that this land was six weeks&#x27; sail east of the Cape of Good Hope.

De Gonneville&#x27;s tale was first mentioned only 160 years after it allegedly took place, in 1663, when Jean Paulmier de Courtonne, Canon of the Church of Saint-Pierre at Lisieux, a relative of de Gonneville&#x27;s, published a book called &quot;Memoirs Concerning the Establishment of a Christian Mission in the Austral Land&quot;, in which he claimed to be the great-grandson of an &quot;Indian&quot; brought back to France by de Gonneville in 1505.

De Courtonne&#x27;s claims struck a chord at a time when French patriotism was offended at the success of the Dutch and the English in making new discoveries in the South Pacific. De Gonneville&#x27;s tales were fomented as the basis of a French claim over these new lands. This belief grew in the 18th century and led to French expeditions such as those of Bouvet, Bougainville, and Kerguelen.

Historians have proposed many places for the land that Gonneville discovered and that were presumed to be the legendary Terra Australis (or as had also been proposed, Madagascar). Some believe it was somewhere on the south coast of Brazil. Based on D&#x27;Avezac weak and never proved theory, others proposed São Francisco do Sul, in the state of Santa Catarina. Wherever the place of his arrival, and the inhabitants he encountered, Gonneville brought one Indigenous boy back to France (whose name the French rendered as Essomericq), who married Gonneville&#x27;s daughter. Historian Leyla Perrone-Moises, who wrote a book on the subject, says the place of his arrival is unknown Since then, Binot Paulmier de Gonneville&#x27;s purported feat as the first European to arrive in Southern Brazil, is celebrated annually both in his hometown of Honfleur, in Normandy, and curiously in the island of São Francisco do Sul in Brazil, where a memorial plate has been erected commemorating the French explorer&#x27;s arrival in 1504, notwithstanding the affair is more of a tale than a proven fact.

Some recent scholars have argued that Gonneville and his story were probably invented by Jean Paulmier de Courtonne, though others are uncertain of this argument.

Arkan Simaan, Un marin en Terre des perroquets (“A sailor in Land of Parrots“), Ancre de marine éditions.
It is a fiction based on the story of Binot Paulmier de Gonnevile who talks about the arrival of the first “French” in Brazil in 1504 and the first “Brazilian” in France. The author uses his imagination to fill the unknown episodes of Binot&#x27;s story at the Admiralty of Rouen. There we find navigation, storms, the clash of cultures between Europeans and indigenous peoples, cannibalism, piracy, a naval battle, a shipwreck...

<text>Carlos Prats González (; February 24, 1915 – September 30, 1974) was a Chilean Army officer and politician. He served as a minister in Salvador Allende&#x27;s government while Commander-in-chief of the Chilean Army. He resigned in August 1973 amid growing national discontent. Immediately after General Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s September 11, 1973 coup, Prats went into voluntary exile in Argentina. The following year, he and his wife, Sofía Cuthbert, were assassinated in Buenos Aires by a car bomb planted by the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional.

==Background==
Carlos Prats González was born in Talcahuano in 1915, the oldest son of Carlos Prats Risopatrón and Hilda González Suárez. He joined the Army in 1931, and graduated at the top of his class.

In 1935, he was commissioned as an artillery officer. Three years later he became a Sub-lieutenant. Soon he returned to the Military Academy, this time as a teacher. He taught there and at the War Academy until 1954. In 1944, he married Sofia Cuthbert Chiarleoni, with whom he had three daughters.

In 1954, Prats González was promoted to Major, and sent to the military mission to the United States as adjunct military attaché, where he served until 1958. That year he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and returned to the War Academy as a teacher. In 1961, he became commander of the Artillery Regiment Nº3 “Chorrillos”, and in 1963, became commander of the Regiment Nº1 “Tacna”.

In 1964, Prats González was promoted to Colonel and sent as military attaché to Argentina. He returned to Chile in 1967 as commander of the III Army Division. In 1968, he was promoted to Brigade General and Chief of the General Staff. The following year he was promoted to Division General.

==Public role during the Allende years==

Salvador Allende was elected in the 1970 Chilean presidential election. General Prats became the head of the &quot;constitutionalists&quot;, members of the armed forces who supported the Schneider Doctrine. With time, he became the army&#x27;s strongest supporter of President Allende, and was appointed several times as a member of his cabinet. Allende appointed him Vice-President in 1972 (The Chilean Constitution does not have a standing vice-presidential office; rather, the sitting Minister of the Interior, as the senior cabinet minister, is temporarily designated &quot;vice president&quot; during the President&#x27;s absence on formal State visits abroad).

Prats&#x27; reputation was significantly damaged in the Alejandrina Cox incident of June 1973, in which he became involved in an altercation with members of the public and fired a shot at their car. He immediately tendered his resignation, but Allende refused to accept it. Days later, an attempted coup known as the Tanquetazo took place; Prats&#x27; rapid response helped to defeat the coup and somewhat restored his public standing.

===Resignation===
On August 22, 1973, the wives of Prats&#x27; generals and officers staged a rally in front of his home, calling him a coward for not restoring civil order in Chile. This event convinced Prats that he had lost support of his fellow officers. The next day he resigned his positions as Interior minister and as Commander in Chief of the Army. The only two other generals in favor of a constitutional solution to the political crisis, Generals Mario Sepulveda Squella and Guillermo Pickering (both in key troop command positions), also presented their resignations in a show of support for him. General Augusto Pinochet, previously second in command and thought to be loyal to Allende, was appointed Commander in Chief of the Army, taking over the position on August 23, 1973. Prats had personally recommended to Allende to appoint Pinochet to the position.

Prats&#x27; retirement removed the last real obstacle to a military coup, which took place three weeks later, on September 11, 1973. Immediately after the coup, on September 15, 1973, Prats voluntarily went into exile with his wife in Argentina.

== Death ==
On September 30, 1974, in Buenos Aires, Prats and his wife Sofia were killed outside their apartment by a radio-controlled car bomb. Debris reached the ninth-floor balcony of the building across the street. 

===Legal aftermath and investigations===
In 1983, Michael Townley admitted to his role in carrying out the assassination of Prats on behalf of DINA officials, but was granted immunity from prosecution after entering a plea deal. The former leaders of DINA, including chief Manuel Contreras, ex-chief of operation, and retired general Raúl Iturriaga, his brother Roger Iturriaga, and ex-brigadiers Pedro Espinoza and Jose Zara, were charged in 2003 in Chile with Prats&#x27; assassination, and were later convicted. The Chilean judge investigating the case, Alejandro Solis, exempted Pinochet from prosecution after the Chilean Supreme court rejected a request in January 2005 to lift the ex-dictator&#x27;s immunity.

In Argentina, DINA civil agent Enrique Arancibia was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2004 for Prats&#x27; murder. In 2000, SIDE agent Juan Martín Siga Correa was detained by Argentine officials on the orders of federal judge María Servini de Cubría. Martín Siga Correa was DINA&#x27;s main connection with the SIDE and with Intelligence Battalion 601, and was also a member of the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.

In 2003, Argentine federal judge María Servini de Cubría asked Chile for the extradition of Mariana Callejas, who was Michael Townley&#x27;s wife, and Cristoph Willikie Fleent, a retired colonel from the Chilean army; the three together were charged with Prat&#x27;s murder. But Chilean Appeals court judge Nibaldo Segura refused extradition in July 2005, arguing that the three had already been prosecuted in Chile.

Italian terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie was reportedly also involved in the murder of Prats. Along with fellow extremist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, Delle Chiaie testified in Rome in December 1995 before Judge Servini that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and Michael Townley were directly involved in this assassination.

<doc id="318226" wikidata="Q211039" url="?curid=318226" title="Jeppe Aakjær">
<text>Jeppe Aakjær (10 September 1866 – 22 (23) April 1930) was a Danish poet and novelist, a member of the &#x27;Jutland Movement&#x27; in Danish literature&quot;. A regionalist, much of his writings was about his native Jutland. He was known for writings that reflected his concern for the impoverished and for describing rural existence.

==Biographical information==
Jeppe was born on 10 September 1866 in Fly, Jutland, a small village near Skive. He came from a large family as he was one of eight, born to Jens Peder Jensen and Catherine Marie. His father was a farmer and Jeppe at a young age learned the family trade. This sowed the seeds of his poetic existence. His early jobs were that of a herdsboy, someone that tends cattle. His father was a hard worker and a supporter of the Venstre party (liberal). This influenced Jeppe as he showed strong liberal leanings early on. At the farm that the family lived, his grandfather also resided, in an arrangement called &quot;aftægt&quot;, which was where the parents cede ownership of the farm/business in trade for room and board until death. This system did not work well in many cases, and in Jeppe&#x27;s family&#x27;s case, his grandfather was tyrannical, a drinker, and foul-mouthed. This also influenced him, as in later years he would rail against the system in his writing, in particular in &quot;Paa Aftægt: En Fortælling&quot; (In Retirement: A Story, 1907), &quot;Vredens Børn: Et Tyendes Saga&quot; (Children of Wrath: A Servant&#x27;s Saga, 1907), and &quot;Bondens Søn: Skildringer fra Fjends Herred&quot; (The Peasant&#x27;s Son: Pictures from the Fjend District, 1899)

==Education==
Schooling, whereas the government of Denmark had made it mandatory for all children, was not important to most rural families, his being no exception. He initially spent more time working on the farm than at school. This changed in 1882, when a teacher by the name of Niels Jakobsen started teaching at the school at Fly. He convinced his parents to send him to Staby to attend one of the Folk High Schools. Then in 1884 his parents allowed him to travel to Copenhagen. He attended Blaagaard&#x27;s Teacher&#x27;s College. Here he studied intensively with Jakobsen to with the goal of obtaining his teacher degree. He did not finish as he left just after his preliminary exams.

==Early writing==
His first experience with writing was while he attended the school in Staby, in 1883. He started contributing material for the journal &quot;Skattegraveren&quot; (The Treasure Hunter), which was edited by Evald Tang Kristensen. This journal specialized in folklore, of which Jeppe was fascinated with. Jeppe had, over the course of his youth, heard and remembered many stories, anecdotes, fables, and other literary short pieces. He, over the course of the next several years gathered and submitted hundreds of submissions. In all, over three hundred narratives, riddles, and songs were submitted, the majority of which were published. His book &quot;Jydske Folkeminder VIII: Sagn og Overtro fra Jylland&quot; (Jutlandic Folklore VIII: Legends and Superstitions from Jutland, 1886) contained at least 77 of these prior published works. He also submitted names for Evald to research more on his own and he shared his success by sending him copies of the journals for many years. This relationship would last a lifetime. He would use these early forays into writing throughout his career to fill many a page. His book &quot;Po fir glowend Pæl: Fra jen si bitte Tid: En Sagnsamling&quot; (On Four Glowing Posts: From My Childhood: A Myth Collection, 1923) was a compilation of 26 of these legends, set on a foggy night in Davbjærg Pass. With this and others he would demonstrate his ability at expressing the immediacy of the folk performance as well as the Jutlandic dialect. Another good example of the ability to meld folklore with legendary themes was his early book &quot;Jens Langkniv: Af Fjends Herreds Krønike bog&quot; (Jens Longknife: From the Chronicles of the Fjend District, 1915). In this book he showed his skill at the folktale mixing with historical aspects of 16th-century Danish witchcraft. This ability was not limited to his stories as he also demonstrated this in his poetry, for example in &quot;Bjergmands-snak&quot; (Mound-Dweller&#x27;s Talk, 1949) a very long poem told by the mound-dweller.

==Career==
===Early works===
While in Copenhagen for school, he became enamored with the big city and its cultural opportunities. Here he began to be influenced by other writers such as Brandes and Hørup, and also by politicians such as Jens Busk. In 1886, he left Copenhagen to spend time with his family on the farm and on other farms. It was during this time that he also began to tour and lecture at the Folk High Schools. His lectures had a political twist to them and he tried to &quot;wake the spirit of resistance&quot; within the laborers and farmers. The government felt at times that he crossed the line and became seditious and at the age of 20, he was sent to jail for speaking in Viborg. Being an outspoken socialist Aakjær joined the Social Democratic Party. He moved to Copenhagen and worked as a proofreader and journalist. In the winter of 1887-1888 Jeppe travelled to Askov, where he studied at the folk school. From there he moved to Elbæk, where he stayed until 1890. At Elbæk, he taught at the school, but after the short taste of teaching decided that that was not the life for him.

1890 saw him drafted into the military, where he was initially placed in the infantry at Skive. After a period of time he was relocated to Copenhagen, which also did not last long. Six weeks after his initial conscription, he was discharged due to vision problems. After his military career ended, he needed more money and tried his hand at teaching once again. He first returned to Elbæk into 1891, then moved to a school run by Morten Pontoppidan. In 1892, he again decided that the life of a teacher was not for him. He returned to Copenhagen to continue his education, this time in History. In 1893, he met and married Marie Bregendahl. This relationship, which produced one son, Svend, was not a highlight of his life and the seven years that he remained married to Marie were years he would rather forget. During these latter student years, he became more involved in the politics of the school, and was even elected to the executive committee. He held that position for several years. In 1895, he received his &quot;studentereksamen&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree) and in 1896 his &quot;candidatus&quot; degree. He continued to study history at the University of Copenhagen for the next two years, after which he abandoned his academic career due to the economics of his life and started writing professionally. He then commenced to obtain his first jobs in the industry. He was hired, first, as a proofreader/copy editor, and, second, as a journalist.

===Newspapers===
His first job as a copy editor was at the Left Reform newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;, which was run by Edvard Brandes. While working at this newspaper, Jeppe first made a name for himself with his &quot;Missionen og dens Høvding&quot; (The Mission and its Chieftain, 1897). In this piece, he attacks the concept of Christianity in general, and in particular goes after the Lutheran movement of Vilhelm Beck, called the Inner Mission. Here he postulates the danger involved in it, partly for the fact that it was becoming rural in nature and appearing in the areas that he loved. Brandes was impressed with his work and promoted him to contributor (journalist). After some time he switched to the newspaper &quot;København&quot;, where he spent a few uneventful years. In 1899, after switching again, this time to &quot;Provinspresse&quot;, a social democratic publication, he became a parliamentary correspondent and started to make more of a name for himself. He remained with this paper until 1903. Later in life, Jeppe would not look back fondly on his time as a newspaper man, as he felt they robbed him of his productivity. He did however keep a lasting relationship with Brandes, who continued to give good reviews to his books.

In 1899, he wrote his first major literary piece, &quot;Bondens Søn&quot; (The Peasant&#x27;s Son), in which in an autobiographical manner relates the story of a poor Jutlander, Jens. Jens moves to Copenhagen and battles with the conservative Christianity that was instilled in him by his grandfather. In time Jens returns home with a girlfriend in tow, but rather than a glorious homecoming, he receives instead the feelings of provincialism and negativity towards the freedoms of the big city. In time he inherits his fathers farm, marries his hometown sweetheart, but never gives into the traditional peasant culture. Some critics regarded the piece as naive, it is Jeppe&#x27;s first attempt at melding cultural and political issues into one.

===Literary Success===
Aakjær tried to get the publishing firm of Gyldendal to partner with him, but was initially rebuffed, even though he was sought after by one of its editors, Peter Nansen. Instead he found a local bookstore owner, V. Oscar Søtofte, who published his first novel. Soon thereafter, he released a collection of earlier writing, &quot;Derude fra Kjærne&quot; (Out There from the Watering Holes, 1899). In time a rift formed between the two over a couple of issues. First, Aakjær did not like the choice of covers that Oscar had chosen. Second, he felt that the marketing ability of Oscar was severely limited, and finally, when Jeppe wanted to release a collection of shorts stories as a single book, Oscar objected and instead broke it into two. The collection, &quot;Vadmelsfolk: Hedefortællinger&quot; (Homespunfolk: Heath Stories, 1900) was released around Christmas 1900, but saw lackluster sales which forced Jeppe to seek a new publisher.

Gyldendal, who now had seen the strength of his writing had no problem forming a relationship with Jeppe, and they started by releasing the second of the short story collection, &quot;Fjandboer: Fortællingen fra Heden&quot; (Fjand Dwellers: Stories from Heden, 1901). Over time nearly all of his remaining books were to be published by Gyldendal, with one notable exception, &quot;Pigen fra Limfjorden: Roman&quot; (The Girl from Limfjord: Novel, 1921), which he published with a small publisher, Danske Forfatteres Forlag. His relationship with Gyldendal was not always good as in time he grew to resent them and felt they were too demanding. He also did not, initially, have a good agreement with them, as he was allotted 150 kroner advance each month (enough to keep him above the subsistence level). However, with this advance he needed to produce a substantial amount of work, which he was not successful in doing. In time he was in substantial debt to the publisher, in the amount of 8,000 kroner. One thing that he managed to do was keep the rights to all of his works, which was not normal in this era.

The turn of the century saw Jeppe embarking on an endeavor that would take a few years to accomplish and most of his time. This project was the biography of Steen Steensen Blicher. With the support of Gyldendal, he spent countless hours, weeks, and months perusing archives, throughout the country. The work, &quot;Steen Steensen Blichers Livs-Tragedie i Breve og Aktstykker&quot; (Steen Steensen Blicher&#x27;s Life Tragedy in Letters and Documents, 1903-1904) was released in subscription style with a total of 36 volumes. The piece was not financially successful; however, in time it came known to be a literary masterpiece, and a major contribution to Danish literary history. His next project deviated from his typical fare and in 1905 and 1906, he released a series of poetic pieces: &quot;Fri Felt: En Digstamlin&quot; (Open Field: A Poem Collection, 1905), &quot;Rugens Sange og Andre Digte&quot; (Songs of the Rye and Other Poems, 1906). The second book was generally considered to be his best work ever, and it contains &quot;Jens Langkniv&quot; (Jens Longknife). He wrote these poems while living with friends, and instead of a political slant, they dealt with the beauty of rural life. He would later reminisce about inspiration for the poems being long walks by himself, where he would stamp out the rhythm with his feet as he was creating the words. A lot of the inspiration came from Robert Burns, who Jeppe felt was able to capture the nuances of rural dialect, the beauty of the land, the emotions of the farmers life, and the day-to-day rhythms of the existence. In his piece, &quot;Esper Tækki: En Sallingbo-Empe&quot; (Esper Tækki: A Salling Imp, 1913), he drew on Robert Burns&#x27; poem &quot;Tam O&#x27;Shanter&quot;.

In 1906, Aakjær received the fellowship, &quot;Anckerske Legat&quot; (Anckerske Scholarship), and commenced to tour Europe with his friend Lauritz Larsen. After a period of time on the continent, he went to Scotland by himself to connect with and be inspired by Robert Burn&#x27;s work. It was during this trip that he suffered a relapse of a chronic digestive illness. This prevented him from spending much more time touring and he would only get one more chance to travel. In 1913, he was able to tour Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and England, with his son. In this latter trip, it was again cut short, this time by a painful foot blister and he skipped his Scotland portion.

===Poetry===
In 1907, he turned a swath of land that he had purchased in 1905 into his farm, Jenle. He then, that same year, married for the second time, this time to Nanna Krog, an artist. This marriage was the opposite of his first, as it was happy and long. Together they had two children, Esben, a son, and Solvejg, a girl. 1908, saw the state issuing him an 800 kroner stipend annually, which along with his publishing money ensured financial security. In 1910, Jeppe started what would become an annual event, the Jenlefest, a folk festival. These would become famous for their mix of politics, literary figures, and farmers. They would continue until 1929. 1907, also saw him branch into the dramatic, as he wrote the piece, &quot;Livet paa Hegnsgaard: Bondekomedie i fire Akter&quot; (Life at Hegns Farm: Rural Comedy in Four Acts). The play was originally written (most of it) in 1901, but was rejected by the Folketeater (People&#x27;s Theater) in Copenhagen. When a friend convinced him to finish in it 1907, it became a commercial success, even though he was not very happy with the actor&#x27;s ability to capture the nuances of Jutland. His next play, &quot;Ulvens Søn: Skuespil i fire Akter&quot; (The Wolf&#x27;s Son: Play in Four Acts, 1909) brought with it social ideas similar to &quot;Vredens Børn&quot;. In 1911 he released what he felt was his best play, &quot;Naar Bønder elsker: Skuespil i femn Akter&quot; (When Peasant&#x27;s Love: Play in Five Acts, 1911), which did not receive as good a reception as his earlier plays. His last two plays, &quot;Himmelbjærgpræsten: Et Skuespil&quot; (The Minister of Himmelbjæarg: A Play, 1917) and &quot;Rejsegildet: Skuespil i 5 Akter&quot; (The Going-Away Party: Play in 5 Acts, 1925) were never performed.

In 1911, he published his most controversial work, &quot;Af Gammel Jehannes hans Bivelskistaarri: En bette Bog om stur&#x27; Folk&quot; (From Old Jehanne&#x27;s Bible Stories: A Little Book about Big Folk, 1911), where he retells biblical stories per a narrator who changes them to suit the Jutlandic dialect and also to fit the social and cultural environment. Critics claimed the work was blasphemous, whereas he felt that it made the Biblical stories more accessible. He continued to write with religious and socially critical themes with, among others, &quot;Hvor der er gjærende Kræfter: Landarbejderroman&quot; (Where There are Fermenting Powers: Farmworker Novel, 1916), &quot;Af min Hjemstavns Saga: Lidt Bondehistorie&quot; (From My Provincial Sage: Little Farmer Story, 1919). He also continued to write his idyllic poetry in several collections, &quot;Vejr og Vind og Folkesind: Digte&quot; (Rain and Wind and Folkspirit: Poems, 1916), &quot;Hjærtegræs og Ærenpris: Digtsamling&quot; (Quaking Grass and Speedwell: Poem Collection, 1921), and &quot;Under Aftenstjernen: Digte&quot; (Under the Evening Star: Poems, 1927).

===Death===
As he neared the end of his life, Jeppe focused more on his memoirs and also historical writing. His memoirs filled four volumes, &quot;Fra min Bitte-Tid: En Kulturhistorisk Sevbiografi&quot; (From My Childhood: A Cultural Historical Autobiography, 1928), &quot;Drengeaar og Knøseaar: Kilderne Springer og Bækken gaar&quot; (Boyhood Years and Laddish Years: The Wells Spring and the Stream Flows, 1929), &quot;Før det dages: Minder fra Halvfemserne&quot; (Before Dawn: Memories from the Nineties, 1929), and &quot;Efterladte Erindringer: Fra Tiden Omkring Aarhundred-Skiflet og Fremefter&quot; (Posthumous Memories: From Times around the Turn of the Century and Afterwards, 1934). Most of his autobiographical works were written while sick in bed from a bout with gangrene. He died two years later from a heart attack.

==Jutland Movement==
As a member of the so-called Jutland Movement, his focus in writing was on his native land. Others in the group included Johannes V. Jensen and Jakob Knudsen. Rather than forming a physical group they were grouped by their love of their native land and their love of writing about that land. As Jeppe grew older he wondered why the movement never had an actual leader. He states in his memoirs&#x27;, 
Alle de andre Litteraturretninger havde fra første Færd haft en Fører. Romantikken havde Johan Ludvig Heiberg og adskillige andre. Realism fra &#x27;70erne havde altid Georg Brandes, den utrætteligste Lansedrager, for den ny Tid. Halvfemsernes Maaneskindsmænd havde C. E. Jensen ... Men den jydske Retning fik ikke sin egen Kritiker. Den Mand kom aldrig frem og har ikke vist sig endnu, der forstod den inderste Nerve i den jydske Retnings Litteratur.

&quot;All the other Literary Movements had from the beginning a guide. Romanticism had Johan Ludvig Heiberg and assorted others. Realism from the 1870s had Georg Brandes, the most tireless point man for the new age. Nineties moonlight men had CE Jensen ... But the Jutlandic School never had his own critic. That man never came forward and still has not to this very day, who understood the inner nerve in the Jutland School&#x27;s Literature.&quot;

==Notable works==

Aakjær&#x27;s notable novels, including &quot;Bondens Søn&quot; (&quot;The Peasant&#x27;s Son&quot;) (1899) and &quot;Vredens børn, et tyendes saga&quot; (&quot;Children of Wrath: A Hired Man&#x27;s Saga&quot;) (1904), reveal his staunch social commitment. The latter is a rural Danish answer to Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot; and in many ways caused the same effect but on a lesser scale. He also wrote &quot;Hvor Bønder bor&quot; (&quot;Where Farmers Live&quot;) (1908), &quot;Arbejdets Glæde&quot; (&quot;The Joy of Work&quot;) (1914), and &quot;Jens Langkniv&quot; (1915), about a Danish highwayman becoming a guerrilla fighter against the Germans in the 17th century. Many tales and short stories tell about the humble, bad life of farm boys and grooms and are written with a visceral anger and a fighting spirit. He also wrote some plays, such as &quot;Livet paa Hegnsgaard&quot;, (&quot;Life at the Hegn Farm&quot;) (1907), and a biography on his predecessor, Steen Steensen Blicher.

Today, it is his poetry for which he is chiefly known. His poems, including the famous &quot;Fri felt&quot; (&quot;Free Fields&quot;; 1905), the &quot;Rugens sange&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Rye&quot;; 1906) and &quot;Heimdal&#x27;s Wanderings&quot; (1924), reveal his appreciation for the harvest. Because of their lyrical quality, many of these poems were used as settings for songs by various 20th Century Scandinavian composers, such as Carl Nielsen. In these songs he sings of the moors of his region, the areas of his childhood and the poor life in the country, often switching between harsh realism, a fresh love of nature and sentimental nostalgia. Some of his poems are written in dialect. Among his best known are the beloved &quot;Jeg er Havren&quot; (&quot;I am the Oats&quot;); &quot;Jens Vejmand&quot;, a tribute to the worn-out roadmender; &quot;Jutland&quot; (English translation by J. A. Peehl); and &quot;Historiens Sang&quot; (&quot;The Song of History&quot;). As a poet, he shows himself an agitator, writing battle songs for the working class.

Aakjær is one of the most beloved Danish poets of the 20th Century. As a Jutlandish regionalist and dialect writer he is the heir of Blicher. But he was also inspired by Robert Burns, whose &quot;Auld lang syne&quot; he translated into Jutlandish dialect. Together with Johannes Vilhelm Jensen and Martin Andersen Nexø he is one of the outstanding &quot;new realists&quot; from the 1910s though never that famous outside Denmark. In many ways he is a literary figure of transition between old rural culture and modern socialist agitation. As a castigator of society, he was popular, even among his opponents.

His first wife was the author Marie Bregendahl, known for her regionalist works.
==The Oats==
Aakjær&#x27;s poem &quot;Havren&quot; (The Oats) was first published in his poetry collection &quot;Vejr og Vind og Folkesind&quot; from 1916. As his other poetry, it is mostly a salute to nature, in contrast to his otherwise very political agitation and writing. &quot;Havren&quot; is a poem in twelve verses, and a melody was composed for it in 1917 by Aksel Agerby. Today, only seven or eight of the original twelve verses are sung, and the song is often referred to as &quot;Jeg er havren&quot; (I am the oats).

:Original poem in Danish
&lt;poem&gt;
HAVREN

Jeg er Havren. Jeg har Bjælder paa,
mer end tyve, tror jeg, paa hvert Straa.
Bonden kalder dem for mine Fold.
Gud velsigne ham, den Bondeknold!

Jeg blev saaet, mens glade Lærker sang
over grønne Banker Dagen lang;
Humlen brumled dybt sin Melodi,
og et Rylefløjt gled ind deri.

Viben fløj om Brak og Pløjemand
og slog Kryds for baade Plov og Spand.
Kryds slog Bonden ogsaa over mig
for at gi’ mig Helse med paa Vej.

Mens i Dug jeg groede Fod for Fod,
groede Sangen sammen med min Rod;
den, som ydmyg lægger Øret til,
hører Lærkens Triller i mit Spil.

Det kan kolde Hjærner ej forstaa
Jeg er Lærkesangen paa et Straa,
Livets Rytme døbt i Sommerdræ,
mer end Gumlekost for Øg og Fæ.

Søndenvinden, o! han har mig kjær;
derfor kan han aldrig la’ mig vær’,
smyger sig med Hvisken til mig ind
nu ved højre, nu ved venstre Kind.

Naar han puster paa min gule Top,
maa jeg vugge med ham ned og op,
indtil alle mine Bjælder gaar,
som naar gyldne Hamre sammen slaar.

Juniregnen gjorde myg min Muld,
Julisolen gav mig af sit Guld,
Sundhed risler mig i Top og Skaft.
Det er derfra Plagen har sin Kraft.

Jeg er Ven med Dug og Grødevejr,
Ven med Landets lyse Bøgetræer,
Ven med al den danske Sæd, som gror
øst for Hav som vest for Sund og Fjord.

Jeg faar Solens sidste lange Blink,
før den dukker ned bag gullig Brink,
og naar Aftenklokken ringer Fred,
staar jeg paa min Taa og ringler med.

Jeg skal ringle Barnet til dets Seng,
ringle Taagen op af Sump og Eng,
ringle Freden over Hjemmet ind,
ringle Bønnen frem i fromme Sind.

Jeg er Havren. Mine Bjælder gaar
over lyse Vange Aar for Aar,
ringler om, hvor Sang og Kjærve gror
herligt sammen paa den danske Jord.

Jeppe Aakjær
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="318228" wikidata="Q2058509" url="?curid=318228" title="Duke of Brabant">
<text>The Duke of Brabant (, ) was the ruler of the Duchy of Brabant since 1183/1184. The title was created by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in favor of Henry I of the House of Reginar, son of Godfrey III of Leuven (who was duke of Lower Lorraine at that time). The Duchy of Brabant was a feudal elevation of the existing (since 1085/1086) title of landgrave of Brabant. This was an Imperial fief which was assigned to Count Henry III of Leuven shortly after the death of the preceding count of Brabant, Herman II of Lotharingia (born 20 September 1085). Although the corresponding county was quite small (limited to the territory between the rivers Senne and Dender) its name was applied to the entire country under control of the dukes from the 13th century on. In 1190, after the death of Godfrey III, Henry I also became duke of Lotharingia. Formerly Lower Lotharingia, this title was now practically without territorial authority, but was borne by the later dukes of Brabant as an honorific title.

In 1288, the dukes of Brabant became also dukes of Limburg. The title fell to the dukes of Burgundy in 1430. Later on, it followed with the Burgundian inheritance until the French Revolution, although the northern part of the territory of Brabant was actually governed by the United Provinces during the 17th and 18th centuries (see Generality Lands).

Today, the title of duke or duchess of Brabant designates, since the Royal Decree of 16 December 1840 (amended in 1991), the heir apparent to the throne of Belgium. The current holder is Princess Elisabeth.

== Dynastic context==

=== House of Belgium (House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until 1920) ===

In the current Kingdom of Belgium, the title of &quot;Duke of Brabant&quot; has been revived as a dynastic title at the court, and is traditionally assigned to the oldest son or daughter of the sovereign (even though the province of North Brabant, part of the historical duchy, is now part of the Netherlands and has been so since 1648).

The oldest son or daughter automatically becomes the duke/duchess of Brabant when his/her father becomes King of the Belgians; there is no ceremony or formal oath that the new duke/duchess must pass. When the Duke of Brabant loses his father, or when he abdicates, his title goes to the next in line, and he becomes the new King of the Belgians. Unlike the office of King of the Belgians, the eldest child of the sovereign does not need to reach the age of 18 to become Duke of Brabant. However, if a Duke or Duchess of Brabant has not reached the age of 18, he or she cannot ascend to the throne of Belgium, as stipulated by the constitution.
When the prince or princess becomes duke of Brabant, this title takes precedence of the other titles: Prince or Princess of Belgium.

The last Duke of Brabant became King in 2013, and passed the title to his oldest child. The current Duchess, Elisabeth was only 12 years old when she became duchess in 2013. The Dukes and Duchess of the House of Belgium (House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha until 1920) are as follows:

* Leopold II (1840–1865)
* Leopold, son of Leopold II (1865–1869) – the only prince who died a Duke of Brabant.
* Leopold III (1909–1934)
* Baudouin (1934–1951)
* Philippe (1993–2013)
* Elisabeth (2013–present)


==== Legislation ====
Article 1, alinea 2, of the Royal Decree of 16 December 1840 says, since an amendment in 2001 : &quot;The title of Duke of Brabant or of Duchess of Brabant will be worn, in future, by the Prince or the Princess, elder son or daughter of the King, and, if lacking, by the Prince or the Princess, elder son or daughter of the elder son or daughter of the King&quot;

<doc id="318231" wikidata="Q7766591" url="?curid=318231" title="The Stone Book Quartet">
<text>The Stone Book Quartet, or Stone Book series, is a set of four short novels by Alan Garner and published by William Collins, Sons, from 1976 to 1978. Set in eastern Cheshire, they feature one day each in the life of four generations of Garner&#x27;s family and they span more than a century.

In a 1989 interview he called them &quot;four very short novels which hang together as one work, called &quot;The Stone Book Quartet&quot;, where again I write about Alderley Edge, luminously but not magically.&quot; The allusion is to &quot;The Weirdstone of Brisingamen&quot; and its sequels (1960, 1963, 2012), which concern the locale of Alderley Edge, although not the village itself. ISFDB calls them the Alderley series. In the same interview he called the work &quot;exhausting&quot; but &quot;the most rewarding of everything&quot; he&#x27;d done to date.

The four books were first published by Collins in hardcover editions of 270 pages in sum.
# &quot;The Stone Book&quot; (1976, )
# &quot;Tom Fobble&#x27;s Day&quot; (1977, 0-00-184832-1) — the last of four in narrative sequence
# &quot;Granny Reardun&quot; (1977, 0-00-184288-9)
# &quot;The Aimer Gate&quot; (1978, 0-00-184067-3)
One year after &quot;The Aimer Gate&quot;, Collins published a 172-page omnibus entitled &quot;The Stone Book Quartet&quot; (1979, 9780006551515) and subsequent editions have retained the title.

The narrative sequence is &quot;The Stone Book&quot;, &quot;Granny Reardun&quot;, &quot;The Aimer Gate&quot;, and &quot;Tom Fobble&#x27;s Day&quot;.

The series is named for &quot;The Stone Book&quot; (1976), both the first published and the earliest in narrative sequence. In a time when the main trade is stonemason, Mary requests a book from her father and he makes one out of stone as he does not believe books and formal education are valuable. The story won the 1996 Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association as the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not gain a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book&#x27;s rise from obscurity.

While seemingly in modern English, the language of the book is poetic and draws on the patterns and rhythms of local Cheshire dialect. Garner&#x27;s great grandfather was a stonemason, and &quot;The Stone Book&quot; describes his initiating his daughter into the secrets of his craft high on the steeple of a church he is helping to build. When she asks for a book, he shows her an older writing – his own stonemason&#x27;s emblem carved in rock deep within Alderley Edge and dating back countless centuries.

Among Garner&#x27;s works, &quot;The Stone Book&quot; is the tenth most widely held (catalogued) in WorldCat participating libraries.

<text>The Phoenix Award annually recognizes one English-language children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not then win a major literary award. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix that is reborn from its own ashes, signifying the book&#x27;s rise from relative obscurity.

The award was established and is conferred by the Children&#x27;s Literature Association (ChLA), a nonprofit organization based in the United States whose mission is to advance &quot;the serious study of children&#x27;s literature&quot;. The winner is selected by an elected committee of five ChLA members, from nominations by members and outsiders. The token is a brass statue.

The inaugural, 1985 Phoenix Award recognized &quot;The Mark of the Horse Lord&quot; by Rosemary Sutcliff (Oxford, 1965). Beginning 1989, as many as two runners-up have been designated &quot;Honor Books&quot;, with 34 named for the 29 years to 2017.

A parallel award for children&#x27;s picture books, the Phoenix Picture Book Award was approved in 2010 and inaugurated in 2013. There are two awards if the writer and illustrator are different people. &quot;Books are considered not only for the quality of their illustrations, but for the way pictures and text work together to tell a story (whether fact or fiction). Wordless books are judged on the ability of the pictures alone to convey a story.&quot;

==Phoenix Award winners==

There have been 35 Award winners and 35 Honor Books announced since 1985 (1965 to 1998 publications).
==Multiple awards==

As of 2021, there have been three two-time winners of the Phoenix Award:
* Rosemary Sutcliff, 1985, 2010
* Peter Dickinson, 2001, 2008
* Margaret Mahy, 2005, 2007

Mahy of New Zealand was also a runner up in 2006.

Several of the winners have also received the British Carnegie Medal for other books: Sutcliff (1959); Garner (1967); Garfield (1970); Southall (1971); Hunter (1974); Dickinson (1979, 1980); Mahy (1982, 1984); Doherty (1986, 1991).

Three of the winners have also won the American Newbery Medal for other books: Konigsburg (1968 and 1997); Paterson (1978, 1981); Hesse (1998).

==Picture Book Award winners==

The Phoenix Picture Book Award was first given in 2013, for books originally published in 1993.

<doc id="318233" wikidata="Q434453" url="?curid=318233" title="Inger Stevens">
<text>Inger Stevens (born Ingrid Stensland; October 18, 1934 – April 30, 1970) was a Swedish and American film, stage, and Golden Globe–winning television actress.

== Early life ==
Inger Stevens was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the eldest child of Per Gustaf and Lisbet Stensland. When she was six years old, her mother abandoned the family, taking her youngest son Peter with her. Soon after, Stevens&#x27; father moved to the United States, leaving Stevens and her brother Ola in the custody of the family maid and then later with an aunt on Lidingö, an island near Stockholm. In 1944, Stevens and her brother moved to the United States and lived with their father and his new American wife in New York City, where her father was completing his PhD in education at Columbia University. At age 13, Stevens moved with her family to Manhattan, Kansas, where her father taught at Kansas State University. Stevens attended Manhattan High School.

At 15, Stevens fled to Kansas City, where she worked in burlesque shows. At 18, she returned to New York City, where she worked as a chorus girl and in the Garment District while taking classes at the Actors Studio.

== Career ==

Stevens appeared on television series, in commercials, and in plays until she received her big break in the film &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, starring Bing Crosby.

Roles in major films followed, including a starring role opposite Harry Belafonte in 1959&#x27;s &quot;The World, the Flesh and the Devil&quot;, but she achieved her greatest success in the television series &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1963–1966) with William Windom. Previously, Stevens had appeared in episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Sam Benedict&quot;, &quot;The Aquanauts&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

Following the cancellation of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in 1966, Stevens appeared in several films: &quot;A Guide for the Married Man&quot; (1967), &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot;, &quot;5 Card Stud&quot;, and &quot;Madigan&quot;. At the time of her death, Stevens was attempting to revive her television career with the detective drama series &quot;The Most Deadly Game&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Stevens&#x27;s first husband was her agent, Anthony Soglio, to whom she was married from 1955 to 1957.

In January 1966, she was appointed to the advisory board of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute by California governor Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown. She also was named chairman of the California Council for Retarded Children. Her aunt was Karin Stensland Junker, author of &quot;The Child in the Glass Ball&quot;.

After Stevens&#x27; death, Ike Jones, the first African American to graduate from UCLA&#x27;s School of Theater, Film, and Television, alleged that he had secretly married Stevens in Mexico in 1961. Some doubted Jones&#x27; claim because of the lack of a marriage license, the maintenance of separate homes, and the filing of tax documents as single people. However, when Stevens&#x27; estate was being settled, her brother, Carl O. Stensland, confirmed in court that Stevens had hidden her marriage to Jones &quot;out of fear for her career.&quot; Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner A. Edward Nichols ruled in Jones&#x27; favor and named him administrator of her estate. A photograph exists of the two attending a banquet together in 1968.

== Death ==
On the morning of April 30, 1970, Stevens&#x27; roommate and companion Lola McNally found Stevens on the kitchen floor of her Hollywood Hills home. According to McNally, Stevens opened her eyes, lifted her head, and tried to speak, but was unable to utter any sound. McNally told police that she had spoken to Stevens the previous night and had seen no signs of trouble. Stevens died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. On arrival, medics removed a small bandage from her chin that revealed a small amount of fresh blood oozing from a cut that appeared to have been a few hours old. Los Angeles County coroner Dr. Thomas Noguchi attributed Stevens&#x27; death to &quot;acute barbiturate poisoning&quot; and the death was eventually ruled a suicide.

<text>Bad Ragaz is a municipality in the &quot;Wahlkreis&quot; (constituency) of Sarganserland in the canton of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

It is the home of a famous natural spring and is a popular spa and health resort destination.

==History==
Bad Ragaz is first mentioned &quot;circa&quot; 843 as &quot;Ragaces&quot;.

As plain Ragaz, the locality was originally a farming village. It had over the centuries a certain importance owing to its position on the north–south route between Germany and Italy. Its history was closely linked to that of the Benedictine Pfäfers Abbey, an important monastery dating back perhaps to the eighth century, which was the dominant landholder around the village and the principal rights holder. The residence of the Prince Abbot of Pfäfers, a building known as the &quot;Hof Ragaz&quot; served as the premises of the local governor or &quot;Statthalter&quot;, a position exercised by the Abbey. 
One of the most notable events in the local chronicles is the &quot;Battle of Ragaz&quot;, an episode in the Old Zürich War of the years 1440–1446 fought between the canton of Zürich and the other seven cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy over which of them should inherit the interests and lands of Count Friedrich VII of Toggenburg, who had died in 1438 intestate and heirless. The armed clash took place at Ragaz on 6 March 1446.

The village suffered over time from the outbreak of several fires and also from flooding which struck, for example, in 1750, 1762 and 1868. However, in the nineteenth century there was an upturn in local fortunes. Financial struggles had prompted the last Abbot of Pfäfers, Plazidus Pfister, to request that Pope Gregory XVI secularize the abbey, a request that was granted on 20 March 1838. On 20 November 1838. The Canton of St. Gallen then took over the Abbey&#x27;s estates, including the local hot springs, which began to be increasingly exploited for tourism thanks to a project connecting the springs with the village. This was to lead eventually, in 1937, to a change of name to Bad Bagaz, and increasing orientation of the local economy towards catering for health spa clientel.

It was in Ragaz that around the year 1880 the Swiss novelist and author of children&#x27;s stories, Johanna Spyri (1827-1901), penned the engaging story of Heidi, a 5-year-old girl living with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Written, as the title page announced, to be a book &quot;for children and those who love children&quot;, it become known throughout the world. Modern-day Ragaz is also proud of the fact that it was the retreat where the Bohemian-Austrian poet and author Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) towards the end of his life reputedly wrote part of his poetic work the &quot;Duineser Elegien&quot; (Duino Elegies), in particular the seventh Elegy with its famous lines &quot;Hiersein ist herrlich...&quot; (&quot;To be here is splendid ...&quot;).
