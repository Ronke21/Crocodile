<text>The Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) was a jazz combo established in 1952 that played music influenced by classical, cool jazz, blues and bebop. The Quartet consisted of John Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Percy Heath (double bass), and various drummers, most notably Kenny Clarke (from 1952 to 1955) and Connie Kay (from 1955 to 1994). The group grew out of the rhythm section of Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s big band from 1946 to 1948, which consisted of Lewis, Jackson, and Clarke along with bassist Ray Brown. They recorded as the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951 and Brown left the group, being replaced on bass by Heath. During the early-to-mid-1950s they became the Modern Jazz Quartet, Lewis became the group&#x27;s musical director, and they made several recordings with Prestige Records, including the original versions of their two best-known compositions, Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Django&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot;. Clarke left the group in 1955 and was replaced as drummer by Kay, and in 1956 they moved to Atlantic Records and made their first tour to Europe.

Under Lewis&#x27;s direction, they carved their own niche by specializing in elegant, restrained music that used sophisticated counterpoint inspired by baroque music, yet nonetheless retained a strong blues feel. Noted for their elegant presentation, they were one of the first small jazz combos to perform in concert halls rather than nightclubs. They were initially active into the 1970s until Jackson quit in 1974 due to frustration with their finances and touring schedule, but re-formed in 1981. They made their last released recordings in 1992 and 1993, by which time Kay had been having health issues and Mickey Roker had been his replacement drummer while Kay was unavailable. After Kay&#x27;s death in 1994, the group operated on a semi-active basis, with Percy Heath&#x27;s brother Albert Heath on drums until the group disbanded permanently in 1997.

==History==
===Background, formation, departure of Kenny Clarke, and Prestige recordings (1946–1955)===
Two of the four founding members of the Modern Jazz Quartet, pianist John Lewis and drummer Kenny Clarke, met and first performed together in 1944 while stationed with the US army in France during World War II. In 1946, they reconnected in New York, where Clarke, who had joined his friend Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s big band, introduced Gillespie to Lewis, who went on to replace Thelonious Monk as the band&#x27;s pianist. The band&#x27;s rhythm section now consisted of Lewis (piano), Milt Jackson (vibraphone), Ray Brown (bass), and Clarke (drums). On Gillespie&#x27;s encouragement, they began to perform improvised renditions of jazz standards as a standalone unit between sets of the big band&#x27;s music, as an entr&#x27;acte, a practice that had been accepted in jazz since Benny Goodman introduced his trio in 1935. Jackson later recalled: &quot;From the first time we performed in that band as a quartet, we became prominent and a part of the band. We would play fifteen to twenty minutes, two or three tunes, and everybody loved it, including Dizzy and the band.&quot; Upon the dissolution of Gillespie&#x27;s band, the rhythm section considered continuing as a quartet under Jackson&#x27;s name, but they went in their own directions for the next three years. On August 18, 1951, they made a recording as the Milt Jackson Quartet for Gillespie&#x27;s record label, Dee Gee Records. Brown then left the group to concentrate on working with his wife, singer Ella Fitzgerald, and was replaced as bassist by Percy Heath, who had also performed with Gillespie. The quartet was incorporated on January 14, 1952, as the Modern Jazz Society, Inc., of which the Modern Jazz Quartet became the working entity. Three or four names were considered, including the New Jazz Quartet, before the group decided to use the name &quot;Modern Jazz Quartet&quot;. In a 1992 interview, Lewis said of the name: &quot;It was an arbitrary name, the quickest name we could get cleared for a corporation in New York state. It had nothing to do with a description of the music.&quot; Heath later recalled a conversation between the group members that occurred in Jackson&#x27;s Cadillac on the way home from a nightclub date that led up to the creation of the Modern Jazz Quartet:
In April 1952 they recorded for Hi-Lo Records as the Milt Jackson Quartet and also made a record for Blue Note Records with Lou Donaldson on saxophone as the Milt Jackson Quintet, later released on &quot;Wizard of the Vibes&quot;; the latter record contained the first recording of &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot;, which would become a signature song of the Modern Jazz Quartet. In November of that year they accompanied Charlie Parker in a live recording at Birdland. For Prestige Records, they made their first recordings as the Modern Jazz Quartet on December 22, 1952 which, on Prestige CEO Bob Weinstock&#x27;s insistence, were released under the group name &quot;Milt Jackson and the Modern Jazz Quartet&quot;. These recordings contained the original version of Lewis&#x27;s composition &quot;Vendome&quot;, the Quartet&#x27;s first experiment with combining jazz and fugal counterpoint. Between 1953 and early 1955 the group recorded the tracks that were eventually released on the album &quot;Django&quot; (1956), including their first recording of Lewis&#x27;s composition &quot;Django&quot;, another signature piece for the Quartet. In 1953 they also accompanied Ben Webster and Sonny Rollins on live recordings, the former being released in 2001 as &quot;1953: An Exceptional Encounter&quot;. In October 1953, the Quartet began its first major booking at Birdland, which was followed by appearances in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Carnegie Hall. Reviewing their appearance at Birdland, Nat Hentoff wrote: &quot;If the success of the Modern Jazz Quartet depended only on the support of jazz musicians, this could be the most in-demand unit in the country.&quot; Heath recalled:
In January 1955, they returned to Birdland, and on the last night of that engagement, Clarke announced that he was quitting the band. He later said that he did so because &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be able to play the drums my way again after four or five years of playing eighteenth-century drawing-room jazz&quot;. Lewis recalled &quot;He was trying to find himself. There was a change in the music, but it was early when Kenny left so it was easy to handle and adjust to. If we had to make the change later, it would have been a disaster. We had to give up a lot of pieces we played when Kenny left.&quot; Heath commented &quot;It had to change, because there is no other Kenny Clarke. Kenny didn&#x27;t want to have such orchestrated music because he was an innovator and didn&#x27;t want his part dictated.&quot; Jackson said &quot;The three years Kenny was in the group was an experimental stage. We were still looking for a direction.&quot; Monte Kay, who had by then become the group&#x27;s manager, suggested that Clarke be replaced by Connie Kay (no relation), who joined the group the day after Clarke had left. The group members had come to have various responsibilities besides playing their instruments: Lewis was the musical director, Jackson handled public relations, Heath managed the finances, and Kay organized the accommodation and transportation. On July 2, 1955, the Modern Jazz Quartet recorded their last album with Prestige Records, &quot;Concorde&quot;; its title track was Lewis&#x27;s second major fugue-influenced piece for the group.

===Move to Atlantic Records and international success (1956–1974)===

In 1956, the Modern Jazz Quartet moved to Atlantic Records, which was switching from singles to LPs and began focusing on jazz under the guidance of Nesuhi Ertegun, who signed the group to the company and worked with them as a producer. In that year, they recorded the album &quot;Fontessa&quot; and had their first formal collaboration with an invited guest, clarinetist Jimmy Giuffre, recorded as &quot;The Modern Jazz Quartet at Music Inn&quot;. In October of that year the Quartet took their first trip to Europe, where they recorded for South German Radio (SDR), performed on a month-long Birdland All-Star tour with Bud Powell, Miles Davis, and Lester Young, and had a two-week residency at Club Saint-Germain in Paris. The next year they came back to Europe on their own, performing 88 concerts in four months in Germany, France, and the British Isles, receiving rave reviews. In 1957, they also recorded a self-titled studio album, the live album &quot;The Modern Jazz Quartet and the Oscar Peterson Trio at the Opera House&quot;, and Lewis&#x27;s first film soundtrack, for &quot;No Sun in Venice&quot;. The group recorded &quot;The Modern Jazz Quartet at Music Inn Volume 2&quot; with Sonny Rollins in 1958 and 1959 saw Lewis&#x27;s creation of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot;, originally recorded with an orchestra and released in an arrangement for the Quartet as &quot;Music from Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1960). In 1960, they released &quot;Pyramid&quot; and &quot;European Concert&quot;, and contributed to the third stream movement with &quot;Third Stream Music&quot; (with Jimmy Giuffre 3) and &quot;The Modern Jazz Quartet &amp; Orchestra&quot;. In 1962 they released &quot;The Comedy&quot;, containing a suite by Lewis inspired by characters from &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, and &quot;Lonely Woman&quot;, whose title track was one of the first recorded covers of a composition by free jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman. They followed up with &quot;The Sheriff&quot; and &quot;Collaboration&quot; with guitarist Laurindo Almeida (1964), along with &quot;The Modern Jazz Quartet Plays George Gershwin&#x27;s Porgy and Bess&quot; and &quot;Jazz Dialogue&quot; with the All Star Jazz Band (1965). They released a collaboration with the Swingle Singers, &quot;Place Vendôme&quot; (1966), and three live albums, &quot;Concert in Japan &#x27;66&quot; (in Japan only), &quot;Blues at Carnegie Hall&quot; (1966), and &quot;Live at the Lighthouse&quot; (1967).

They then moved from Atlantic to Apple Records, for which they released &quot;Under the Jasmin Tree&quot; (1968) and &quot;Space&quot; (1969). Lewis, who produced these albums, recalled: &quot;Monte Kay was a friend of the president of the Beatles&#x27; company, and he felt we weren&#x27;t getting the attention we should have, so we went there and had two good records.&quot; Returning to Atlantic, they released &quot;Plastic Dreams&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Legendary Profile&quot; (1972). In 1973 they recorded the last two studio albums before their hiatus, &quot;In Memoriam&quot; (with an orchestra conducted by Maurice Peress) and &quot;Blues on Bach&quot;, both of which were released the next year). During this period, they performed annual Christmas concerts at the New York City Town Hall; a recording of performances from 1971 with Paul Desmond on saxophone was released in 1981.

===Hiatus, reunion, and final years (1974–1997)===

In July 1974, Jackson quit the group, later citing frustration with their finances as his primary reason. He was also unhappy with the group&#x27;s touring schedule, which by then had become year-round rather than the previous arrangement in which they had vacations during the northern hemisphere summer. Jackson had previously used the downtime to play and record music that was not in the style of the Modern Jazz Quartet, but felt saddled in the group after they also began playing at summer jazz festivals around 1970. The jazz magazine &quot;DownBeat&quot; compared their breakup to &quot;the abrupt disintegration of Mt. Rushmore&quot;. In November 1974 they performed a farewell concert at Avery Fisher Hall, later released as a series of two albums and then as a complete package, &quot;The Complete Last Concert&quot; (1988). They had occasional reunion concerts, never going more than eighteen months without playing together, before reuniting in 1981 for a tour of Japan, recorded as &quot;Reunion at Budokan 1981&quot; for Pablo Records. They recorded three more albums for Pablo, &quot;Together Again: Live at the Montreux Jazz Festival &#x27;82&quot; (1982), &quot;Echoes&quot; (1984), and &quot;&quot; (1985), before returning to Atlantic, recording &quot;Three Windows&quot; (1987, with the New York Chamber Symphony) and &quot;For Ellington&quot; (1988).

Kay had a stroke in 1992 and during his recovery was replaced by drummer Mickey Roker, who performed on some tracks on the group&#x27;s last released recording, &quot;MJQ &amp; Friends: A 40th Anniversary Celebration&quot; (recorded 1992–1993, released 1994). Kay died in November 1994, after which the group operated on a semi-active basis; the 1995 album &quot;Dedicated to Connie&quot;, a recording of a 1960 concert in Slovenia, was released in his memory. In February 1995, Albert Heath, Percy Heath&#x27;s brother, became the quartet&#x27;s percussionist. Percy Heath had become tired of touring by 1997 and the group permanently disbanded in that year after a final recording date. In October 1999, Jackson died, followed by Lewis in March 2001 and Heath in April 2005.

==Style and public image==
The Modern Jazz Quartet played in a cool jazz style that combined bebop and the blues with classical elements. There was a marked contrast in styles between Jackson&#x27;s rhythmically complex blues-based solos and Lewis&#x27;s restrained manner of playing and classically influenced pieces. One of the first small jazz combos to perform in concert halls rather than nightclubs, the group was noted for habitually wearing formal attire at concerts, inspired by the bands of Duke Ellington and Jimmie Lunceford. In his book &quot;Visions of Jazz&quot;, Gary Giddins summed up their legacy with an explanation of the jazz scene in 1992: &quot;... Young bands customarily performed in concert and at festivals, often in tailored suits. Composition was as widely vaunted for small ensembles as improvisation, and flawless intonation was considered vital. Such traditional jazz devices as polyphony, riffs, breaks, boogie bass, mutes, and fugal counterpoint, as well as a repertory that ranges over the entire history of the music, were everywhere apparent. You could say that the Modern Jazz quartet now resided in a world at least partially of its own making.&quot;

==Honors and legacy==
The Modern Jazz Quartet earned a variety of honors, including the first NAACP award for cultural contributions in the field of music in 1957, top billing on numerous jazz magazine polls, and honorary doctorates from Berklee College. The Modern Folk Quartet, which was most active in the 1960s, took their name as a conscious parallel with the Modern Jazz Quartet.

<text>The bat&#x27;leth (Klingon: , rough pronunciation: ; plural , ) is a double-sided scimitar/hook sword/lujiaodao hybrid-edged weapon with a curved blade, four points, and three handholds on the back. It was designed and created by &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; visual effects producer Dan Curry for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, where it is the characteristic close combat weapon of Klingons. Curry has called the bat&#x27;leth &quot;one of the iconic images associated with the show.&quot; It has spawned a smaller weapon, which became known as the mek&#x27;leth; in Klingon, this is written . A third weapon, a kur&#x27;leth, was later designed by Dan Curry, for Season 3 of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Bat&#x27;leths have become an enduring symbol of the franchise among fans, and they are occasionally referenced in other media.

== Description ==
A bat&#x27;leth is a curved blade approximately long, with two spiked protrusions at each end and three handholds along the back which can be used to twist and spin the blade rapidly.

Dan Curry created the bat&#x27;leth in 1990 for Worf, the character played by Michael Dorn in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; after receiving approval from producer Rick Berman. Curry based the bat&#x27;leth&#x27;s design on the Chinese fighting crescent. A martial artist aside from his regular work as a visual-effects producer, Curry also developed a fighting style, based on a variety of different martial arts he learned during his time in Asia, for the use of the weapon.

===Mek&#x27;leth===

In 1995, Curry developed a smaller version of the bat&#x27;leth, the mek&#x27;leth, whose design he based on that of a Northern Tibetan cavalry sword, for Dorn to use when Dorn joined the cast, and Worf joined the crew, of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&quot; Mek&#x27;leths are intended for one-handed use and shaped like a scimitar; they are approximately half the length of the full-size bat&#x27;leth.

== Use in &quot;Star Trek&quot; ==
In &quot;Star Trek&quot; lore, the Klingon Kahless created the bat&#x27;leth around CE 625. According to Klingon mythology, he formed the blade by dropping a length of his hair into some lava from inside the Kri&#x27;stak Volcano, then cooling, shaping, and hardening it in the lake of Lursor. He then united Qo&#x27;noS, the Klingon homeworld, by killing a tyrant named Molor with the weapon, which became known as the Sword of Kahless. The sword was later stolen by a species called the Hur&#x27;q during their invasion of Qo&#x27;noS. In the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Sword of Kahless&quot;, Worf and another Klingon named Kor rediscover the artifact, but it is eventually transported into space to prevent them from using it to attack each other. The Sword of Kahless differs from normal bat&#x27;leths as it has five points and one handhold compared to four points and three handholds.

In the Klingon language, the bat&#x27;leth was originally referred to as , then was shortened to . The word bat&#x27;leth itself means &quot;sword of honor&quot;. Bat&#x27;leths are made of a reinforced metal called baakonite and are normally long and weigh .

The bat&#x27;leth appeared in 29 television episodes across the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, and later appears in several episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. The bat&#x27;leth was also used in the 1994 film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. The mek&#x27;leth appeared in the television series &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and in the 1996 film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;. The Sword of Kahless appeared in the 2000 video game &quot;Star Trek: Armada&quot; and normal bat&#x27;leths appeared in the 1996 video game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;. Some of the bat&#x27;leth&#x27;s uses were in the debut episode &quot;Reunion&quot;, where Worf teaches his son Alexander how to use one. Worf used a bat&#x27;leth to kill Durasa Klingon who killed Worf&#x27;s mate K&#x27;Ehleyr. Notable uses of the weapon occurred in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Barge of the Dead&quot;in which Tuvok uses a bat&#x27;leth to teach B&#x27;Elanna Torres about her Klingon heritage, and in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Tacking into the Wind&quot; in which Worf kills the leader of the Klingon High Council, Gowron, in a bat&#x27;leth duel to give the Klingon Chancellorship to General Martok.

== Cultural legacy ==

The bat&#x27;leth is considered an iconic image of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some and a part of Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons dealers, and pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, displays one in his office. However, due to the dangers that real bat&#x27;leths can pose, no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures.

The rise in the popularity of the bat&#x27;leth has led to the formation of martial arts teams aiming to develop a martial art distinct from the one Curry initially developed. Such teams have incorporated moves from ju-jitsu, kendo, , and nunchaku. Bat&#x27;leth competitions have been held at conventions such as MileHiCon and StarCon.

The bat&#x27;leth has appeared in television programs outside the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In 2002, it was seen in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episode &quot;The Other Guys&quot;. In 2005, a bat&#x27;leth was in the background of the US detective series &quot;Monk&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra&quot;. In 2010, one was seen in the &quot;Chuck Versus the Beard&quot; episode of the American action-comedy series &quot;Chuck.&quot; In 2011, a bat&#x27;leth was used in American situation comedy &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Zarnecki Incursion&quot;. A bat&#x27;leth also receives screen time in the television film &quot;Swindle&quot; (2013).

== Legality ==
Replicas of the bat&#x27;leth are often made of metal and can be dangerous. Media reports documenting instances of replica bat&#x27;leths being used in crimes have referred to the weapon as a &quot;double-pointed Klingon crescent-shaped sword&quot;, a &quot;Klingon-type sword&quot;, a &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; Klingon-type sword&quot; or as a &quot;double-pointed scimitar&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, it is legal to possess a bat&#x27;leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are considered to be &quot;potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle.&quot; They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of what the court documents later described as a &quot;multi-bladed sword&quot; in a public street. His defense called the item a &quot;Star Trek bat’leth sword&quot; although it was not an official replica, and the judge said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it in my life before.&quot; The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat&#x27;leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat&#x27;leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.

=== United States ===
The legality of the bat&#x27;leth in the United States differs between states. In 2009, a small double bladed knife shaped like a bat&#x27;leth was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two armed robberies. The Colorado Springs Police Department said that it was a deadly weapon. The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered and seized a bat&#x27;leth like weapon as part of a cache of weapons in connection with a $4 million Medicare fraud investigation in 2010.

<doc id="310914" wikidata="Q1622692" url="?curid=310914" title="Hodge star operator">
<text>In mathematics, the Hodge star operator or Hodge star is a linear map defined on the exterior algebra of a finite-dimensional oriented vector space endowed with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form. Applying the operator to an element of the algebra produces the Hodge dual of the element. This map was introduced by W. V. D. Hodge.

For example, in an oriented 3-dimensional Euclidean space, an oriented plane can be represented by the exterior product of two basis vectors, and its Hodge dual is the normal vector given by their cross product; conversely, any vector is dual to the oriented plane perpendicular to it, endowed with a suitable bivector. Generalizing this to an -dimensional vector space, the Hodge star is a one-to-one mapping of -vectors to -vectors; the dimensions of these spaces are the binomial coefficients formula_1.

The naturalness of the star operator means it can play a role in differential geometry, when applied to the cotangent bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, and hence to differential -forms. This allows the definition of the codifferential as the Hodge adjoint of the exterior derivative, leading to the Laplace–de Rham operator. This generalizes the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, in which divergence of a vector field may be realized as the codifferential opposite to the gradient operator, and the Laplace operator on a function is the divergence of its gradient. An important application is the Hodge decomposition of differential forms on a closed Riemannian manifold.

== Formal definition for &quot;k&quot;-vectors ==
Let be an -dimensional oriented vector space with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form formula_2, referred to here as a scalar product. (In more general contexts such as pseudo-Riemannian manifolds and Minkowski space, the bilinear form may not be positive-definite.) This induces a scalar product on -vectors for formula_3, by defining it on simple -vectors formula_4 and formula_5 to equal the Gram determinant
: formula_6
extended to formula_7 through linearity.

The unit -vector formula_8 is defined in terms of an oriented orthonormal basis formula_9 of as:
: formula_10
(Note: In the general pseudo-Riemannian case, orthonormality means
formula_11 for all pairs of basis vectors.)
The Hodge star operator is a linear operator on the exterior algebra of , mapping -vectors to ()-vectors, for formula_3. It has the following property, which defines it completely:
: formula_13 for all -vectors formula_14

Dually, in the space formula_15 of -forms (alternating -multilinear functions on formula_16), the dual to formula_17 is the volume form formula_18, the function whose value on formula_19 is the determinant of the formula_20 matrix assembled from the column vectors of formula_21 in formula_22-coordinates. Applying formula_18 to the above equation, we obtain the dual definition:
: formula_24 for all -vectors formula_14

Equivalently, taking formula_4, formula_5, and formula_28:
: formula_29

This means that, writing an orthonormal basis of -vectors as formula_30 over all subsets formula_31 of formula_32, the Hodge dual is the ()-vector corresponding to the complementary set formula_33:
: formula_34
where formula_35 is the sign of the permutation formula_36
and formula_37 is the product
formula_38. In the Riemannian case, formula_39.

Since Hodge star takes an orthonormal basis to an orthonormal basis, it is an isometry on the exterior algebra formula_40.

== Geometric explanation ==
The Hodge star is motivated by the correspondence between a subspace of and its orthogonal subspace (with respect to the scalar product), where each space is endowed with an orientation and a numerical scaling factor. Specifically, a non-zero decomposable -vector formula_41 corresponds by the Plücker embedding to the subspace formula_42 with oriented basis formula_43, endowed with a scaling factor equal to the -dimensional volume of the parallelepiped spanned by this basis (equal to the Gramian, the determinant of the matrix of scalar products formula_44). The Hodge star acting on a decomposable vector can be written as a decomposable ()-vector:
: formula_45
where formula_46 form an oriented basis of the orthogonal space formula_47. Furthermore, the ()-volume of the formula_48-parallelepiped must equal the -volume of the formula_49-parallelepiped, and formula_50 must form an oriented basis of formula_51.

A general -vector is a linear combination of decomposable -vectors, and the definition of Hodge star is extended to general -vectors by defining it as being linear.

== Examples ==

=== Two dimensions ===
In two dimensions with the normalized Euclidean metric and orientation given by the ordering , the Hodge star on -forms is given by
formula_52

=== Three dimensions ===
A common example of the Hodge star operator is the case , when it can be taken as the correspondence between vectors and bivectors. Specifically, for Euclidean R3 with the basis formula_53 of one-forms often used in vector calculus, one finds that
formula_54

The Hodge star relates the exterior and cross product in three dimensions: formula_55 Applied to three dimensions, the Hodge star provides an isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector is associated with a bivector and vice versa, that is: formula_56.

The Hodge star can also be interpreted as a form of the geometric correspondence between an axis of rotation and an infinitesimal rotation (see also: 3D rotation group#Lie algebra) around the axis, with speed equal to the length of the axis of rotation. A scalar product on a vector space formula_51 gives an isomorphism formula_58 identifying formula_51 with its dual space, and the vector space formula_60 is naturally isomorphic to the tensor product formula_61. Thus for formula_62, the star mapping formula_63 takes each vector formula_64 to a bivector formula_65, which corresponds to a linear operator formula_66. Specifically, formula_67 is a skew-symmetric operator, which corresponds to an infinitesimal rotation: that is, the macroscopic rotations around the axis formula_68 are given by the matrix exponential formula_69. With respect to the basis formula_53 of formula_71, the tensor formula_72 corresponds to a coordinate matrix with 1 in the formula_73 row and formula_74 column, etc., and the wedge formula_75 is the skew-symmetric matrix formula_76, etc. That is, we may interpret the star operator as: formula_77 
Under this correspondence, cross product of vectors corresponds to the commutator Lie bracket of linear operators: formula_78.
=== Four dimensions ===
In case formula_79, the Hodge star acts as an endomorphism of the second exterior power (i.e. it maps 2-forms to 2-forms, since ). If the signature of the metric tensor is all positive, i.e. on a Riemannian manifold, then the Hodge star is an involution. If the signature is mixed, i.e., pseudo-Riemannian, then applying the operator twice will return the argument up to a sign – see &quot;&quot; below. This particular endomorphism property of 2-forms in four dimensions makes self-dual and anti-self-dual two-forms natural geometric objects to study. That is, one can describe the space of 2-forms in four dimensions with a basis that &quot;diagonalizes&quot; the Hodge star operator with eigenvalues formula_80 (or formula_81, depending on the signature).

For concreteness, we discuss the Hodge star operator in Minkowski spacetime where formula_79 with metric signature and coordinates formula_83. The volume form is oriented as formula_84. For one-forms,
formula_85
while for 2-forms,
formula_86

These are summarized in the index notation as
formula_87

Hodge dual of three- and four-forms can be easily deduced from the fact that, in the Lorentzian signature, formula_88 for odd-rank forms and formula_89 for even-rank forms. An easy rule to remember for these Hodge operations is that given a form formula_90, its Hodge dual formula_91 may be obtained by writing the components not involved in formula_90 in an order such that formula_93. An extra minus sign will enter only if formula_90 contains formula_95. (For , one puts in a minus sign only if formula_90 involves an odd number of the space-associated forms formula_73, formula_74 and formula_99.)

Note that the combinations
formula_100
take formula_81 as the eigenvalue for Hodge star operator, i.e.,
formula_102
and hence deserve the name self-dual and anti-self-dual two-forms. Understanding the geometry, or kinematics, of Minkowski spacetime in self-dual and anti-self-dual sectors turns out to be insightful in both mathematical and physical perspectives, making contacts to the use of the two-spinor language in modern physics such as spinor-helicity formalism or twistor theory.

=== Conformal invariance ===
The Hodge star is conformally invariant on -forms on a -dimensional vector space formula_103, i.e. if formula_104 is a metric on formula_103 and formula_106, then the induced Hodge stars 
formula_107
are the same. 

=== Example: Derivatives in three dimensions===
The combination of the formula_108 operator and the exterior derivative generates the classical operators , , and on vector fields in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This works out as follows: takes a 0-form (a function) to a 1-form, a 1-form to a 2-form, and a 2-form to a 3-form (and takes a 3-form to zero). For a 0-form formula_109, the first case written out in components gives:
formula_110

The scalar product identifies 1-forms with vector fields as formula_111, etc., so that formula_112 becomes formula_113.

In the second case, a vector field formula_114 corresponds to the 1-form formula_115, which has exterior derivative:
formula_116

Applying the Hodge star gives the 1-form:
formula_117
which becomes the vector field formula_118.

In the third case, formula_114 again corresponds to formula_115. Applying Hodge star, exterior derivative, and Hodge star again:
formula_121

One advantage of this expression is that the identity , which is true in all cases, has as special cases two other identities: (1) , and (2) . In particular, Maxwell&#x27;s equations take on a particularly simple and elegant form, when expressed in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star. The expression formula_122 (multiplied by an appropriate power of −1) is called the &quot;codifferential&quot;; it is defined in full generality, for any dimension, further in the article below.

One can also obtain the Laplacian in terms of the above operations:
formula_123

The Laplacian can also be seen as a special case of the more general Laplace–deRham operator formula_124 where in three dimensions, formula_125 is the codifferential for formula_126-forms. Any function formula_127 is a 0-form, and formula_128 and so this reduces to the ordinary Laplacian. For the 1-form formula_129 above, the codifferential is formula_130 and after some straightforward calculations one obtains the Laplacian acting on formula_129.

== Duality ==
Applying the Hodge star twice leaves a -vector unchanged up to a sign: for formula_132 in an -dimensional space , one has
: formula_133
where is the parity of the signature of the scalar product on , that is, the sign of the determinant of the matrix of the scalar product with respect to any basis. For example, if and the signature of the scalar product is either or then . For Riemannian manifolds (including Euclidean spaces), we always have .

The above identity implies that the inverse of formula_108 can be given as
: formula_135

If is odd then is even for any , whereas if is even then has the parity of . Therefore:
: formula_136
where is the degree of the element operated on.

== On manifolds ==
For an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot;, we apply the construction above to each cotangent space formula_137 and its exterior powers formula_138, and hence to the differential &quot;k&quot;-forms formula_139, the global sections of the bundle formula_140. The Riemannian metric induces a scalar product on formula_141 at each point formula_142. We define the Hodge dual of a &quot;k&quot;-form formula_143, defining formula_144 as the unique (&quot;n&quot; – &quot;k&quot;)-form satisfying
formula_145
for every &quot;k&quot;-form formula_146, where formula_147 is a real-valued function on formula_148, and the volume form formula_149 is induced by the pseudo-Riemannian metric. Integrating this equation over formula_148, the right side becomes the formula_151 (square-integrable) scalar product on &quot;k&quot;-forms, and we obtain:
formula_152

More generally, if formula_148 is non-orientable, one can define the Hodge star of a &quot;k&quot;-form as a (&quot;n&quot; – &quot;k&quot;)-pseudo differential form; that is, a differential form with values in the canonical line bundle.

=== Computation in index notation ===
We compute in terms of tensor index notation with respect to a (not necessarily orthonormal) basis formula_154 in a tangent space formula_155 and its dual basis formula_156 in formula_157, having the metric matrix formula_158 and its inverse matrix formula_159. The Hodge dual of a decomposable &quot;k&quot;-form is:
formula_160

Here formula_161 is the Levi-Civita symbol with formula_162, and we implicitly take the sum over all values of the repeated indices formula_163. The factorial formula_164 accounts for double counting, and is not present if the summation indices are restricted so that formula_165. The absolute value of the determinant is necessary since it may be negative, as for tangent spaces to Lorentzian manifolds.

An arbitrary differential form can be written as follows:
formula_166

The factorial formula_167 is again included to account for double counting when we allow non-increasing indices. We would like to define the dual of the component formula_168 so that the Hodge dual of the form is given by
formula_169

Using the above expression for the Hodge dual of formula_170, we find:
formula_171

Although one can apply this expression to any tensor formula_90, the result is antisymmetric, since contraction with the completely anti-symmetric Levi-Civita symbol cancels all but the totally antisymmetric part of the tensor. It is thus equivalent to antisymmetrization followed by applying the Hodge star.

The unit volume form formula_173 is given by:
formula_174

=== Codifferential ===

The most important application of the Hodge star on manifolds is to define the codifferential formula_175 on formula_126-forms. Let
formula_177
where formula_178 is the exterior derivative or differential, and formula_179 for Riemannian manifolds. Then
formula_180
while
formula_181

The codifferential is not an antiderivation on the exterior algebra, in contrast to the exterior derivative.

The codifferential is the adjoint of the exterior derivative with respect to the square-integrable scalar product:
formula_182
where formula_143 is a formula_126-form and formula_146 a formula_186-form. This property is useful as it can be used to define the codifferential even when the manifold is non-orientable (and the Hodge star operator not defined). The identity can be proved from Stokes&#x27; theorem for smooth forms:
formula_187
provided formula_148 has empty boundary, or formula_146 or formula_190 has zero boundary values. (The proper definition of the above requires specifying a topological vector space that is closed and complete on the space of smooth forms. The Sobolev space is conventionally used; it allows the convergent sequence of forms formula_191 (as formula_192) to be interchanged with the combined differential and integral operations, so that formula_193 and likewise for sequences converging to formula_194.)

Since the differential satisfies formula_195, the codifferential has the corresponding property
formula_196

The Laplace–deRham operator is given by
formula_197
and lies at the heart of Hodge theory. It is symmetric:
formula_198
and non-negative:
formula_199

The Hodge star sends harmonic forms to harmonic forms. As a consequence of Hodge theory, the de Rham cohomology is naturally isomorphic to the space of harmonic -forms, and so the Hodge star induces an isomorphism of cohomology groups
formula_200
which in turn gives canonical identifications via Poincaré duality of with its dual space.

In coordinates, with notation as above, the codifferential of the form formula_90 may be written as
formula_202
where here formula_203 denotes the Christoffel symbols of formula_154.

==== Poincare lemma for codifferential ====
In analogy to the Poincare lemma for exterior derivative, one can define its version for codifferential, which reads
: &quot;If&quot; formula_205 &quot;for&quot; formula_206&quot;, where &quot; formula_207 &quot;is a star domain on a manifold, then there is&quot; formula_208 &quot;such that&quot; formula_209&quot;.&quot;

A practical way of finding formula_90 is to use cohomotopy operator formula_211, that is a local inverse of formula_212. One has to define a homotopy operator
: formula_213 
where formula_214 is the linear homotopy between its center formula_215 and a point formula_216, and the (Euler) vector formula_217 for formula_218 is inserted into the form formula_219. We can then define cohomotopy operator as
: formula_220,
where formula_221 for formula_222.

The cohomotopy operator fulfills (co)homotopy invariance formula 
: formula_223
where formula_224, and formula_225 is the pullback along the constant map formula_226.

Therefore, if we want to solve the equation formula_227, applying cohomotopy invariance formula we get
: formula_228 where formula_229 is a differential form we are looking for, and &quot;constant of integration&quot; formula_230 vanishes unless formula_17 is a top form.

Cohomotopy operator fulfills the following properties: formula_232. They make it possible to use it to define &quot;anticoexact&quot; forms on formula_207 by formula_234, which together with exact forms formula_235 make a direct sum decomposition 
: formula_236.

This direct sum is another way of saying that the cohomotopy invariance formula is a decomposition of unity, and the projector operators on the summands fulfills idempotence formulas: formula_237.

These results are extension of similar results for exterior derivative.

<text>Starflight is a space exploration, combat, and trading role-playing video game created by Binary Systems and published by Electronic Arts in 1986. Originally developed for IBM PC compatibles, it was later ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Mac, and Commodore 64. A fully revamped version of the game was released for the Genesis in 1991.

Set in the year 4620, the game puts players in the role of a starship captain sent to explore the galaxy. There is no set path, allowing players to switch freely between mining, ship-to-ship combat, and alien diplomacy. The broader plot of the game emerges slowly, as the player discovers that an ancient race of beings is causing stars to flare and destroy all living creatures.

The game has been widely praised by both contemporary and modern critics, and is one of the earliest instances of a sandbox game. It led to the development of a sequel, &quot;Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula&quot;, and influenced the design of numerous other games for decades after its release.

==Gameplay==
The player begins inside a space station called Starport orbiting the planet Arth. Here they buy and sell minerals, Endurium (fuel), and artifacts, recruit and train crew members, and upgrade parts of the ship. The player hires a crew from five species to man the ship&#x27;s six posts: navigator, science officer, engineer, communications officer, doctor, and captain. A crewman&#x27;s proficiency is determined by the relevant skill: a science officer with a high science skill can determine more of a planet&#x27;s properties and detect aliens at a greater range, for example. Skills are increased through training, which must be purchased. One crewman can man multiple posts, but different species have different maximum skill levels. The ship is initially equipped only with engines and a limited supply of Endurium, a type of crystal used as fuel. The ship can be modified and upgraded through the purchase of weapons, armor, and shields.

The goals of the game include exploration, collection of lifeforms and minerals, and finding habitable colony worlds. Eventually, a larger goal of finding out why stars in the region are flaring dangerously and stopping the process, if possible, comes to the forefront. The main sources of income are selling minerals, artifacts, and lifeforms and recommending planets for colonization. The ship is equipped with a Terrain Vehicle that the crew can use to look for minerals and life-forms. The most lucrative source of income is finding planets suitable for human life. If the science officer&#x27;s analysis shows a planet to be within acceptable parameters, the player can have the captain log a planet for colonization.

&quot;Starflight&quot; has 270 star systems, each containing from zero to eight planets for a total of 800. All star systems can be entered and all planets landed on, though this destroys the ship if the gravity is greater than 8.0 g. The science officer can scan and analyze the planet for information about it, including its temperature, gravity, and chemical composition. When a landing is ordered, a Mercator projection map shows the topography of each planet, as well as a cursor to select a landing point. Once the ship lands, a Terrain Vehicle can be deployed to drive across the terrain, which is periodically scanned for new information, in search of minerals, lifeforms, and alien ruins. As is the case in outer space, a heads-up display monitors the Terrain Vehicle&#x27;s status.

Space is also crisscrossed with &quot;continuum fluxes&quot;, coordinate pairs that allow instantaneous travel between them without consuming fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time, though it causes all but the most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings.

Aliens may be cautious, friendly, or hostile, and all have distinctive speech patterns; the player can influence alien reactions by arming weapons and shields or hailing the aliens with varying communication styles. Alien ships can be also scanned for information. Combat involves maneuvering the ship and firing weapons, either instantly damaging short range lasers or avoidable, but more powerful long range missiles. The weapon used depends on how far away enemy ships are and what the player&#x27;s ship is armed with. The player&#x27;s ship has ablative armor and regenerative shields, and can take damage to its hull and individual components.

==Story==
===Setting===
The galaxy is composed of eight space-faring races, five of which can be hired as part of the player&#x27;s crew. Humans only exist on Arth and are not found among the stars. Other species include Veloxi, large insects who demand bribes from ships that violate their space; Mechan, androids left over from the days of the Old Empire; Elowan, a pacifistic race of sentient plants; Thrynn, reptile creatures who are primarily interested in money; Spemin, gelatinous blobs who are known for their cowardice; Gazurtoid, octopus-like religious zealots who regard all &quot;air-breathers&quot; as infidels; and Uhlek, a destructive fleet of ships with a hive mind. Humor also plays a role within &quot;Starflight&quot;.

===Plot===

The story begins on the planet Arth, a haven for the survivors of the Old Empire. Due to heavy radiation, the inhabitants have been forced to live beneath the planet&#x27;s crust for centuries. In recent times, the radiation has finally dissipated from the surface, allowing the population to unearth long-lost technology belonging to Arth&#x27;s original settlers. The inhabitants of Arth have recently discovered two things: first, that they were once a colony world of Earth; and second, Endurium, a crystalline mineral that fuels interstellar flight.

An independent company called Interstel is dispatching ships to mine for resources, particularly Endurium. In addition, Interstel employees are instructed to seek information about Arth&#x27;s history, alien artifacts, and planets with optimum environments for colonization. Early in the game, Arth scientists discover that stars throughout the local region of the galaxy are flaring, and the home planet of Arth is in danger.

By following clues given in Interstel announcements and through contact with alien races in space, the crew discovers an Old Empire starship adrift in space. An endlessly repeating distress call has been transmitting from the ship for over a thousand years. Before the fall of the Old Empire, a scientific expedition known as the &quot;Noah 9&quot; left Earth in search of Heaven, a paradise world to which humans could immigrate. The expedition never arrived, leaving a fleet of Mechan ships forever waiting for their arrival. Once their coded questions are answered correctly, the Mechans assume that the crew is, in fact, the long-awaited &quot;Noah 9&quot;. Further investigation leads the crew to Earth, the home world of the Old Empire. The planet lies in ruins and is devoid of all life, but contains information about the history of Old Empire and its fate.

Additional clues are found in the Four Seedlings, a quadrilaterally symmetrical system made up of four suns. Centuries ago, the leaders of the Old Empire realized something was causing hostile aliens to flee from the center of the galaxy. The greatest minds from each of the races gathered at this location, where they discovered that the Crystal Planet was slowly eradicating all life. In a last act, they sent a human named Commander McConnell to end it, but he failed. At the start of the game, the Crystal Planet is slowly moving through the galaxy. The planet causes nearby stars to flare up and destroy all life in the system.

The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, and find special artifacts that grant access to the Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player&#x27;s home system flares. Commander McConnell&#x27;s last journal entry can be found on the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they are not even aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet&#x27;s surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.

==Development==
&quot;Starflight&quot; was developed by Binary Systems, a five-man team consisting of Rod McConnell, Greg Johnson (lead designer), Alec Kercso (programming), Tim C. Lee (graphics and programming), and Bob Gonsalves (sound). Then-vice president of Electronic Arts Joe Ybarra was also closely involved as producer. The original idea for making a video game was conceived by McConnell and Ybarra in 1983. McConnell hired colleague Dave Boulton, who had an idea for using fractals to generate an endless virtual universe, along with Kercso, Gonsalves, Lee, and Johnson, all of whom were first time game designers. Boulton quit the project early on in development, saying it was too ambitious, with Lee replacing him.

The team coded the game mostly in Forth with a few key routines written in x86 assembly. Forth was chosen since it is easier to use than assembly and more compact. This was important because the game had to fit into 128 KB of RAM.

It took &quot;fifteen man-years&quot; and three actual years to develop the game. In a 2006 interview, lead designer Johnson said: &quot;I had never really designed a game before ... It&#x27;s funny looking back on it now—just by happenstance I ended up creating a very open ended system where players could go anywhere and do whatever and a story sort of unfolded&quot;. Ybarra said that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by his friend and office-mate Paul Reiche III, the designer of &quot;Archon&quot;, during a period where Reiche was &quot;supposed to be working on &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot;&quot;. Reiche advised Johnson to draft a &quot;story network&quot; that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a &quot;fractal generator&quot;, which took six man-years to develop and allowed them to increase the number of planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally-generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of &quot;roguelike&quot; environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.

&quot;Starflight&quot; was released for PC on August 15, 1986. Originally available only on IBM, Tandy, and compatible PCs, it was released for the Amiga and Commodore 64 in 1989 and the Atari ST and Macintosh in 1990, and a Sega Genesis version was published in 1991. The Genesis version has new graphics, modifications to the ship, and upgrades for the Terrain Vehicle, including equipment to allow amphibious mining.

==Reception==
By December 1987 &quot;Starflight&quot; sold over 100,000 copies, and eventually went on to sell over a million copies. Critical response to &quot;Starflight&quot; upon its release was extremely positive. Hartley and Patricia Lesser complimented the game in their &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column in the December 1986 issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;, calling it &quot;stunning in its presentation and play&quot;. In 1986 and 1987, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared it &quot;the best space exploration game in years&quot; and &quot;the best science fiction game available on computer&quot;. The magazine named &quot;Starflight&quot; its Adventure Game of the Year for 1987, and in August 1988, it joined the magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame for games highly rated over time by readers, with the third-highest rating for action/adventure games on the list, and the fourth-highest overall. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four stars out of five, stating that &quot;such rich NPCs offered additional suspension of belief&quot;.

Science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle named &quot;Starflight&quot; his game of the month for January 1987, stating that it was &quot;as much a career as a game&quot; and &quot;fascinating&quot;. Fellow writer Orson Scott Card wrote: &quot;&quot;Starflight&quot; is the first science fiction computer game that actually gives you something of the experience of roaming through the galaxy. ... I have found this game obsessively fascinating—and the graphics and player interface are superb&quot;. He called it the &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; of science fiction games. Brilliantly designed and programmed ... the standard against which all other space-exploration games must be measured&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&quot; listed it in May 1988 as one of &quot;Our Favorite Games&quot;, stating that &quot;&quot;Starflight&quot; captures the feel of a certain type of science fiction ... the game can take hundreds of hours to play fully, yet those hours are anything but boring&quot;.

In the June 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 15), John Harrington patiently endured the first stage of ship building, but said that after the ship launched, &quot;the game comes into its own [...] The sense of playing a small part in a grand story is very strong&quot;. He did point out some minor drawbacks, but concluded by giving the game an above average rating of 8 out of 10, saying that the game &quot;incorporates [...] a depth and quality of imagination one has not come to expect from an industry obsessed with rehashing alien zapping shott-em-ups&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Starflight&quot; the 55th-best computer game ever released.

Ybarra said in 1987 that the game had created a &quot;beachhead in the arena of sci-fi&quot; for Electronic Arts. Lee said in 2010 that he knew it was a classic while they were building it. Erin Hoffman of &quot;The Escapist&quot; in 2010 called it &quot;one of the great breakthroughs in gaming&quot;. In 2012, Lee Hutchinson of Ars Technica called the game &quot;a thing of awe and reverence&quot; and said it &quot;defined the genre of space exploration games&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 36th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;the most authentic &quot;Star Trek&quot; experience you could have on a PC - and it wasn&#x27;t even a Trek game&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Starflight&quot; had a 1989 sequel, &quot;Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula&quot;.

Reiche was inspired by the game to create &quot;Star Control&quot;, with Johnson coding three of the alien species in the game; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Star Control II&quot; a spiritual successor to &quot;Starflight&quot;. &quot;Mass Effect&quot; director Casey Hudson tweeted in 2011 that &quot;&quot;Starflight&quot; was a key inspiration for the &quot;ME&quot; series&quot;. &quot;Starflight&quot; is often cited along with &quot;Elite&quot;, which appeared two years earlier with similar gameplay, as early open world space exploration games. &quot;Dwarf Fortress&quot;″s forgotten beasts were inspired by the procedurally generated lifeforms within &quot;Starflight&quot;.

&quot;Exoplanet&quot; is a virtual reality game created in 2018 by Gregg Brzozowski, which was inspired by &quot;Starflight&quot;.

&quot;Starflight&quot; was mentioned among GameSpot&#x27;s list of ten games that should be remade; its expansiveness and depth, simplicity and elegance of game mechanics, and multi-level problem solving remain high-regarded in the early 21st-century. 

It is freely available, albeit in streaming mode only, on the Internet Archive under AROS Public License copyright 1995-2016, courtesy the AROS Development Team. It is also readily available (in several emulations) for download. Such is its legacy that there have been numerous fan remakes (some of which projects have failed).

<text>Joensuu (; ; ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of North Karelia. It is located in the eastern interior of the country and in the Finnish Lakeland. The population of Joensuu is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the ninth most populous urban area in the country.

Joensuu was founded in 1848 by the Russian Emperor Nicholas I. The city is located on the northern shore of Lake Pyhäselkä, the northern part of Lake Saimaa, at the mouth of the River Pielinen. The nearest major city, Kuopio in North Savonia, is located to the west. From Joensuu, the distance to Lappeenranta, the capital of South Karelia, is along Highway 6.

As is typical of cities in Eastern Finland, Joensuu is monolingually Finnish. Along with Kuopio, Joensuu is one of major urban, economic, and cultural hubs of Eastern Finland. Joensuu is a student city with a subsidiary of the University of Eastern Finland, which has over 20,000 enrolled students, and a further 4,000 students at the Karelia University of Applied Sciences.

== Heraldry ==
The explanation of the coat of arms of Joensuu reads: &quot;shield twice blocked with upper moat and lower corrugated; fields in red, silver and black.&quot; The wave bar of the subject refers to the location of the city along the Pielinen River and the position of the moat near the eastern border of Finland, while its colors black and red are considered typical colors of Karelia. The coat of arms was designed by Toivo Vuorela, and it was approved by the Joensuu City Council at its meeting on May 10, 1957. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed the use of the coat of arms on November 19 of the same year. In addition to the coat of arms, the city of Joensuu also uses a flag based on it, in which the silver of the coat of arms has been replaced by white.

== History ==
The city of Joensuu, founded by the Czar Nicholas I of Russia in 1848, is the regional centre and the capital of North Karelia. During the 19th century Joensuu was a city of manufacture and commerce. When in 1860 the city received dispensation rights to initiate commerce, former restrictions against industry were removed and the local sawmills began to prosper and expand. Water traffic was improved by the building and opening of the Saimaa Canal in 1856. Consequently, a lively commerce between the regions of North Karelia, St. Petersburg and Central Europe was enabled. At the end of the 19th century Joensuu was one of the largest harbour cities in Finland.

Throughout the centuries Karelian traders have plied the Pielisjoki River. The river has always been the lively heart of the city. Canals – completed by 1870 – increased the river traffic. Thousands of steamboats, barges and logging boats sailed along the river during the golden age of river traffic. The Pielisjoki River has also been an important log raft route, providing wood for the sawmills and for the entire lumber industry.

During the last few decades, the formerly modest agrarian town has developed into a vital centre of the province. Success in regional annexations, the establishment of the region of North Karelia, and investments in education have been the most decisive actions in this development.

The municipality of Pielisensuu was consolidated with Joensuu in 1954. At the beginning of 2005, the municipalities of Kiihtelysvaara and Tuupovaara were consolidated with Joensuu. At the beginning of 2009 the municipalities of Eno and Pyhäselkä were consolidated with Joensuu. After the most recent consolidations, there are approximately 73,000 inhabitants in the Joensuu municipal area.
The University of Joensuu (now part of the University of Eastern Finland since January 2010.) has, in twenty-five years, expanded to eight faculties. The university is one of the mainstays for the vitality of the city and so for all North Karelia. Diversified international cooperation in science, industry and commerce benefits the whole region.

The proximity of the eastern border has been an important factor in the history of the city. The Republic of Karelia is once again a significant area for cooperation with nearby regions in Russia. Export companies in Joensuu continue the pre-revolutionary traditions in foreign trade.

Joensuu offers varied cultural activities. A series of events – Ilosaarirock festival, Joensuu Music Winter, Festival of Visual Culture Viscult, Gospel festivals – and the unspoilt environment increase the attractiveness of the city.

Joensuu is sometimes referred to as the Forest Capital of Europe, mainly because the European Forest Institute is based there. Other forestry research and educational facilities are also based in Joensuu.

<text>The Fifth Crusade (September 1217 - August 29, 1221) was a campaign in a series of Crusades by Western Europeans to reacquire Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land by first conquering Egypt, ruled by the powerful Ayyubid sultanate, led by al-Adil, brother of Saladin.

After the failure of the Fourth Crusade, Innocent III again called for a crusade, and began organizing Crusading armies led by Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI of Austria, soon to be joined by John of Brienne, titular King of Jerusalem. An initial campaign in late 1217 in Syria was inconclusive, and Andrew departed. A German army led by cleric Oliver of Paderborn, and a mixed army of Dutch, Flemish and Frisian soldiers led by William I of Holland, then joined the Crusade in Acre, with a goal of first conquering Egypt, viewed as the key to Jerusalem. There, cardinal Pelagius Galvani arrived as papal legate and &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Crusade, supported by John of Brienne and the masters of the Templars, Hospitallers and Teutonic Knights. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who had taken the cross in 1215, did not participate as promised.

Following the successful siege of Damietta in 1218–1219, the Crusaders occupied the port for two years. Al-Kamil, now sultan of Egypt, offered attractive peace terms, including the restoration of Jerusalem to Christian rule. The sultan was rebuked by Pelagius several times, and the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. En route, they attacked a stronghold of al-Kamil at the battle of Mansurah, but they were defeated and forced to surrender. The terms of surrender included the retreat from Damietta—leaving Egypt altogether—and an eight-year truce. The Fifth Crusade ended in September 1221, a Crusader defeat that failed to achieve its goals.

==Background==
By 1212, Innocent III had been pope for 14 years and faced the disappointment of the Fourth Crusade and its inability to recover Jerusalem, the on-going Albigensian Crusade, begun in 1209, and the popular fervor of the Children&#x27;s Crusade of 1212. The Latin Empire of Constantinople was established, with the emperor Baldwin I essentially elected by the Venetians. (The imperial crown was at first offered to doge Enrico Dandolo, who refused it.) The first Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, the Venetian Thomas Morosini, was contested by the pope as uncanonical.

The ongoing situation in Europe was chaotic. Philip of Swabia was locked in a dispute of the throne in Germany with Otto of Brunswick. Innocent III&#x27;s attempts to reconcile their differences was rendered moot with Philip&#x27;s assassination on 21 June 1208. Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and fought against the pope, resulting in his excommunication. France was heavily invested in the Albigensian Crusade and was quarreling with John Lackland, resulting in the Anglo-French war of 1213–1214. Sicily was ruled by the child-king Henry II and Spain was occupied in their crusade against the Almohads. There was little appetite in Europe for a new Crusade.

In Jerusalem, John of Brienne became the effective ruler of the kingdom through his marriage to Maria of Montferrat. In 1212, Isabella II of Jerusalem was proclaimed queen of Jerusalem shortly after her birth, and her father John became regent. Antioch was consumed with the War of the Antiochene Succession, begun with the death of Bohemond III, not to be resolved until 1219.

Before the arrival of John of Brienne in Acre in 1210, the local Christians had refused to renew their truce the Ayyubids. The next year, John negotiated with the aging sultan al-Adil a new truce between the kingdom and the sultanate to last through 1217. At the same time, in light of the strength of the Muslims and their renewed fortifications, John also asked the pope for help. There was no real force among the Syrian Franks, with many of the deployed knights returning home. If a new Crusade were to begin, it must come from Europe.

Innocent III had hoped to mount such a Crusade to the Holy Land, never forgetting the goal of restoring Jerusalem to Christian control. The pathos of the Children&#x27;s Crusade only nerved him to fresh efforts. But for Innocent, this tragedy had its moral: “the very children put us to shame, while we sleep they go forth gladly to conquer the Holy Land.”

==Preparations for the Crusade==
In April 1213, Innocent III issued his papal bull &quot;Quia maior&quot;, calling all of Christendom to join a new Crusade. This was followed by a conciliar decree, the &quot;Ad Liberandam,&quot; in 1215. The attendant papal instructions engaged a new enterprise to recover Jerusalem while establishing Crusading norms that were to last nearly a century.

The message of the Crusade was preached in France by legate Robert of Courçon, a former classmate of the pope&#x27;s. He was met with bitter complaints by the clergy, accusing the legate of encroaching on their domains. Philip II of France supported his clergy, and Innocent III realized the Robert&#x27;s zeal was a threat to the success of the Crusade. On 11 November 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council was convened. The prelates of France presented their grievances, many well-founded, and the pope pleaded for them to forgive the legate&#x27;s indiscretions. In the end, very few Frenchmen took part in the expedition of 1217, unwilling to go in the company of Germans and Hungarians, with France represented by Aubrey of Reims and the bishops of Limoges and Bayeux, Jean de Veyrac and Robert des Ablèges.

At the council, Innocent III called for the recovery of the Holy Land. Innocent wanted it to be led by the papacy, as the First Crusade should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the Fourth Crusade, which had been taken over by the Venetians. He planned to meet with the Crusaders at Brindisi and Messina for departure on 1 June 1217, and prohibited trade with the Muslims in order to ensure that the Crusaders would have ships and weapons, renewing an 1179 edict. Every Crusader would receive an indulgence as well as those who simply helped pay the expenses of a Crusader, but did not go on the Crusade themselves.

In order to protect Raoul of Merencourt, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, on his return trip to the kingdom, Innocent III tasked John of Brienne to provide escort. As John was in conflict with Leo I of Armenia and Hugh I of Cyprus, the pope ordered them to reconcile their differences before the Crusaders reached the Holy Land.

Innocent III died on 16 July 1216 and Honorius III was consecrated as pope the next week. The Crusade dominated the early part of his papacy. The next year, he crowned Peter II of Courtenay as Latin Emperor, who was captured on his eastward journey in Epirus and died in confinement.

Robert of Courçon was sent as spiritual advisor to the French fleet, but subordinate to newly-chosen papal delegate Pelagius of Albano. Bishop Walter II of Autun, a veteran of the Fourth Crusade, would also return to the Holy Land with the Fifth Crusade. French canon Jacques de Vitry had come under the influence of the saintly Marie of Oignies and preached the Albigensian Crusade after 1210. He arrived at his new position as Bishop of Acre in 1216 and shortly thereafter Honorius III tasked him with preaching the Crusade in the Latin settlements of Syria, made difficult with the rampant corruption at the port cities.

Oliver of Paderborn preached the Crusade in Germany and had great success in recruitment. In July 1216, Honorius III called on Andrew II of Hungary to fulfill his father&#x27;s vow to lead a Crusade. Like many other rulers, the pope&#x27;s former pupil, Frederick II of Germany, had taken an oath to embark for the Holy Land in 1215 and appealed to German nobility to join. But Frederick II hung back, with his crown still in contention with Otto IV, and Honorius repeatedly put off the date for the beginning of the expedition.

In Europe, the troubadours were equally adept in awakening the interest in the Crusade. These included Elias Cairel, a veteran of the Fourth Crusade, Pons de Capduelh, later joining the Crusade in 1220, and Aimery de Pégulhan, who implored by verse a young William VI of Montferrat to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and take the cross.

The strength of the armies was estimated at more than 32,000, including more than 10,000 knights. It was described by a contemporaneous Arab historian as: &quot;This year, an infinite number of warriors left from Rome the great and other countries of the West.&quot; The Crusader force was also prepared to use the latest siege technology, including counterweight trebuchets.

==In Iberia and the Levant==
The departure of the Crusaders began finally in early July 1217. Many of the Crusaders decided to go to the Holy Land by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at Dartmouth on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there, led by William I of Holland, they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of Santiago de Compostela.

At their arrival in Portugal, the Bishop of Lisbon attempted to persuade the Crusaders to help them capture the Almohad controlled city of Alcácer do Sal. The Frisians, however, refused on account of Innocent III&#x27;s disqualification of the venture at the Fourth Lateran Council. The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of Alcácer do Sal in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured the city with the help of the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller, on October 1217.

A group of Frisians who refused to aid the Portuguese with their siege plans against Alacácer do Sal, preferred to raid several coastal towns on their way to the Holy Land. They attacked Faro, Rota, Cádiz and Ibiza, gaining much booty thereby. They thereafter followed the coast of southern France and wintered in Civitavecchia in Italy in 1217–1218, before continuing on their way to Acre. In the north, Ingi II of Norway took the cross in 1216, only to die the next spring, and the eventual Scandinavian expedition was of little consequence.

Innocent III had managed to secure the participation of the Kingdom of Georgia in the Crusade. Tamar of Georgia, queen since 1184, led the Georgian state to its zenith of power and prestige in the Middle Ages. Under her rule, Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in eastern Anatolia. Tamar died in 1213 and was succeeded by her son George IV of Georgia. In the late 1210s, according to the Georgian chronicles, he began making preparations for a campaign in the Holy Land to support the Franks. His plans were cut short by the invasion of the Mongols in 1220. After the death of George IV, his sister Rusudan of Georgia notified the pope that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promises.

==Situation in the Holy Land==

Saladin had died in 1193 and was succeeded in most of his domain by his brother al-Adil, who was the patriarch of all successive Ayyubid sultans of Egypt. Saladin&#x27;s son az-Zahir Ghazi retained his leadership in Aleppo. An exceptionally low Nile River resulted in a failure of the crops in 1201–1202, and famine and pestilence ensued. People abandoned themselves to atrocious practices, habitually resorting to cannibalism. Violent earthquakes, felt as far away as Syria and Armenia, devastated whole cities, and increased the general misery.

After naval raids on Rosetta in 1204 and Damietta in 1211, the chief concern of al-Adil was Egypt. He was willing to make concessions to avoid war, and favoured the Italian maritime states of Venice and Pisa, both for trading reasons and to preclude them from supporting further crusades. Most of his reign was conducted under truces with the Christians, and he constructed a new fortress at Mount Tabor, to buttress the defenses of Jerusalem and Damascus. Most of his conflicts in Syria were with the Knights Hospitaller at Krak des Chevaliers or with Bohemond IV of Antioch, and were dealt with by his nephew az-Zahir Ghazi. Only once, in 1207, did he directly confront the Crusaders, capturing al-Qualai&#x27;ah, besieging Krak des Chevaliers and advancing to Tripoli, before accepting an indemnity from Bohemond IV in exchange for peace.

Az-Zahir maintained an alliance with both Antioch and Kaykaus I, the Seljuk sultan of Rûm, to check the influence of Leo I of Armenia, as well as to keep his options open to challenge his uncle. Az-Zahir died in 1216, leaving as his successor al-Aziz Muhammad, his 3-year-old son, whose mother was Dayfa Khatun, al-Adil&#x27;s daughter. Saladin&#x27;s eldest son, al-Afdal, emerged to make a bid for Aleppo, enlisting the help of Kaykaus I, who also had designs on the region. In 1218, al-Afdal and Kaykaus invaded Aleppo and advanced on the capital. The situation was resolved when al-Ashraf, al-Adil&#x27;s third son, routed the Seljuk army, which remained a menace until the death of Kaykaus in 1220. Given the Crusaders’ Egyptian plan, these diversions were useful in stretching the resources of the sultanate that controlled the Levant with an uneasy cooperation.

==Crusade of Andrew II of Hungary==
The first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King Andrew II of Hungary.
Andrew II had been called on by the pope in July 1216 to fulfill his father Béla III&#x27;s vow to lead a crusade, and finally agreed, having postponed three times earlier. Andrew, who was reputed to have designs on becoming Latin emperor, mortgaged his estates to finance the Crusade. In July 1217, Andrew departed from Zagreb, accompanied by Leopold VI of Austria and Otto I, Duke of Merania. King Andrew&#x27;s army was so largeat least 20,000 mounted soldiers and even much more &quot;uncountable&quot; infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later. They were transported by the Venetian fleet, the largest European fleet of the times. Andrew and his troops embarked from Split on 23 August 1217. 

The Hungarian army landed on 9 October 1217 on Cyprus from where they sailed to Acre and joined John of Brienne, Raoul of Merencourt and Hugh I of Cyprus. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade. In October 1217, the leaders of the expedition held a war council there, presided by Andrew II. Representing the military orders were the masters Guérin de Montaigu of the Hospitallers, Guillaume de Chartres of the Templars, and Hermann of Salza of the Teutonic Knights. Additional attendees included Leopold VI of Austria, Otto I of Merania, Walter II of Avesnes, and numerous archbishops and bishops.

The war plan of John of Brienne envisioned a two-prong attack. In Syria, Andrew&#x27;s forces would engage al-Mu&#x27;azzam, son of Al-Adil, at the stronghold of Nablus. At the same time, the fleet was to attack the port city of Damietta, wresting Egypt from the Muslims and enabling the conquest of the remainder of Syria and Palestine. This plan was abandoned at Acre due to the lack of manpower and ships. Instead, in anticipation of reinforcements, the objective was to keep the enemy occupied in a series of small engagements, perhaps going as far as Damascus.

The Muslims knew that the Crusaders were coming in 1216 with the exodus of merchants from Alexandria. Once the host gathered at Acre, Al-Adil began operations in Syria, leaving the bulk of his forces in Egypt under his eldest son and viceroy Al-Kamil. He personally led a small contingent to support al-Mu&#x27;azzam, then emir of Damascus. With too few to engage the Crusaders, he guarded the approaches to Damascus while al-Mu&#x27;azzam was sent to Nablus to protect Jerusalem.

The Crusaders were camped near Acre at Tel Afek, and on 3 November 1217 began to traverse the plain of Esdraelon towards &#x27;Ain Jalud, expecting an ambush. Upon seeing the strength of the Crusaders, al-Adil withdrew to Beisan against the wishes of al-Mu&#x27;azzam who wanted to attack from the heights of Nain. Again against the wishes of his son, Al-Adil abandoned Beisan which soon fell to the Crusaders who pillaged the city. He continued his retreat to Ajlun, ordering al-Mu&#x27;azzam to protect Jerusalem from the heights of Lubban, near Shiloh. Al-Adil continued to Damascus, stopping at Marj al-Saffar.

On 10 November 1217, the Crusaders crossed the Jordan River at the Jisr el-Majami, threatening Damascus. The governor of the city took defensive measures, and received reinforcements from al-Mujahid Shirkuh, the Ayyubid emir of Homs. Without engaging the enemy, the Crusaders returned to the camp near Acre, crossing over Jacob&#x27;s Ford. Andrew II did not return to the battlefield, preferring to remain in Acre collecting relics.

Now under the command of John of Brienne, as supported by Bohemond IV, the Hungarians moved against Mount Tabor, regarded by the Muslims as impregnable. A battle fought on 3 December 1217 was soon abandoned by the leaders, only to be revisited by the Templars and Hospitallers. Met with Greek fire, the siege was abandoned on 7 December 1217. A third sortie by the Hungarians, possibly led by Andrew&#x27;s nephew, met disaster at Mashghara. The small force was decimated, and the few survivors returned to Acre on Christmas Eve. Thus ended what is known as the Hungarian Crusade of 1217.

At the beginning of 1218, an ailing Andrew decided to return to Hungary, under the threat of excommunication. Andrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, stopping first at Tripoli for the marriage of Bohemond IV and Melisende of Lusignan. Hugh I of Cyprus, accompanying his fellow commanders, became ill at the ceremony and died shortly thereafter. Andrew returned to Hungary in late 1218.

In the meantime, efforts were taken to strengthen Château Pèlerin, by the Templars and aided by Walter II of Aveses, and Caesarea which proved later to be valuable moves. Later in the year, Oliver of Paderborn arrived with a new German army and William I of Holland arrived with a mixed army consisting of Dutch, Flemish and Frisian soldiers. As it became clear that Frederick II was not coming to the East, they began detailed planning. The campaign was to be led by John of Brienne, based on his status in the kingdom and his proven military reputation. The original objective abandoned the year before due to lack of resources was reinstated. The decision to attack Egypt had been made, a springtime assault on Jerusalem rejected because of excessive heat and lack of water. They focused their main thrust on the port of Damietta rather than Alexandria. The European Crusader army was supplemented by troops from the kingdom and the military orders.

==Campaign in Egypt==
On 27 May 1218, the first of the Crusader&#x27;s fleet arrived at the harbor of Damietta, on the right bank of the Nile. Simon III of Sarrebrück was chosen as temporary leader pending the arrival of the rest of the fleet. Within a few days, the remaining ships arrived, carrying John of Brienne, Leopold VI of Austria and masters Peire de Montagut, Hermann of Salza and Guérin de Montaigu. A lunar eclipse on 9 July was viewed as a good omen.

The Muslims were not alarmed at the arrival of the Crusaders, believing that they would not successfully mount an attack on Egypt. Al-Adil was both surprised and disappointed in the West, supporting peace treaties when more radical elements in the sultanate sought &quot;jihad&quot;. He was still camped at Marj al-Saffar, and his sons al-Kamil and al-Mu&#x27;azzam were tasked with defending Cairo and the Syrian coast, respectively. Available reinforcements were sent from Syria, and an Egyptian force encamped at al-&#x27;Adiliyah, a few miles south of Damietta. The Egyptians were of insufficient strength to attack the Crusaders, but did serve to oppose any invader attempt to cross the Nile.
===The Tower of Damietta===
The fortifications of Damietta were impressive, consisting of three walls of varying heights, with dozens of towers on the interior, and were enhanced to repel the invaders. Situated on an island in the Nile was the &quot;Burj al-Silsilah—&quot;the chain tower—called so because of the massive iron chains that could stretch across the river preventing passage. The tower, containing 70 tiers and housing hundreds of soldiers, was key to the capture of the city.

The siege of Damietta began on 23 June 1218 with an assault on the tower, utilizing upwards of 80 ships some with projectile machines, with no success. Two new types of vessels were adapted to meet the needs of the siege. The first, used by Leopold VI and the Hospitallers, was able to secure scaling ladders mounted on two ships bound together. The second, called a &quot;maremme&quot;, was commanded by Adolf VI of Berg and included a small fortress on the mast to hurl stones and javelins. The &quot;maremme&quot;, attacking first, was forced to withdraw when faced with an intense counter-barrage. The scaling ladders, secured against the walls, collapsed under the weight of the soldiers. The first attempt at an assault was a failure.

Oliver of Paderborn, supported by his Frisian and German followers, demonstrating considerable ingenuity and leadership, constructed an ingenious siege engine combining the best features of the earlier models. Protected from Greek fire by hides, it included a revolving ladder that extended far beyond the ship. On 24 August the renewed assault began. By the next day, the tower was taken and the defensive chains cut.

The loss of the tower was a great shock to the Ayyubids, and the sultan al-Adil died shortly thereafter, on 31 August 1218. His body was secretly taken to Damascus and his treasure dispersed before his death was announced. He was succeeded as sultan by his son al-Kamil. The new sultan immediately implemented defensive measures, including scuttling a number of ships a mile upstream, resulting in the Nile being blocked for much of the winter of 1218–1219.

===Preparation for the siege===
The Crusaders did not press their advantage, and many prepared to return home, regarding their crusading vows satisfied. Further offensive action would nevertheless have to wait until the Nile was more favourable and the arrival of additional forces. Among them were papal legate Pelagius Galvani and his aide Robert of Courçon, who travelled with a contingent of Roman Crusaders financed by the pope. A group from England, smaller than expected arrived shortly, led by Ranulf de Blondeville, and Oliver and Richard, illegitimate sons of King John. A group of French Crusaders that arrived at the end of October included Guillaume II de Genève, archbishop of Bordeaux, and the newly elected bishop of Beauvais, Milo of Nanteuil.

On 9 October 1218, Egyptian forces conducted a surprise attack on the Crusaders&#x27; camp. Discovering their movements, John of Brienne and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. From the outset, Pelagius considered himself the supreme commander of the Crusade, and, unable to mount a major offensive, sent specially equipped ships up the Nile to no avail. A follow-on attack on the Crusaders on 26 October also failed, as did a Crusader attempt to dredge an abandoned canal, the al-Azraq, to bypass al-Kamil&#x27;s new defensive measures on the Nile.

The Crusaders now built an enormous floating fortress on the river, but a storm that began on 9 November 1218 blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack. They were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. The storm, lasting 3 days, flooded both camps and the Crusaders&#x27; supplies and transportation were devastated. In the ensuing months diseases killed many of the Crusaders, including Robert of Courçon. During the storm, Pelagius took control of the expedition. The Crusaders supported this, feeling the need for new, more aggressive leadership. By February 1219, they were able to mount new offensives, but were unsuccessful because of the weather and strength of the defenders.

At this time, al-Kamil, in command of the defenders, when he was almost overthrown by a coup to replace him with his younger brother al-Faiz Ibrahim. Alerted to the conspiracy, al-Kamil had to flee the camp to safety and in the ensuing confusion the Crusaders were able to advance on Damietta. Al-Kamil considered fleeing to the Ayyubid emirate of Yemen, ruled by his son al-Mas&#x27;ud Yusuf, but the arrival of his brother al-Mu&#x27;azzam with reinforcements from Syria ended the conspiracy. The Crusader attack mounted against the Egyptians on 5 February 1219 was then different, the defenders having fled, abandoning the camp.

The Crusaders now surrounded Damietta, with the Italians to the north, Templars and Hospitallers to the east, and John of Brienne with his French and Pisan troops to the south. The Frisians and Germans occupied the old camp across the river. A new wave of reinforcements from Cyprus arrived led by Walter III of Caesarea.

At this point, al-Kamil and al-Mu&#x27;azzam attempted to open negotiations with the Crusaders, asking Christian envoys to come to their camp. They offered to surrender the kingdom of Jerusalem, less al-Karak and Krak de Montréal which guarded to road to Egypt, with a multi-year truce, in exchange for the Crusaders&#x27; evacuation of Egypt. John of Brienne and the other secular leaders were in favour of the offer, as the original objective of the Crusade was the recovery of Jerusalem. But Pelagius and the leaders of the Templars, Hospitallers and Venetians refused this and a subsequent offer with compensation for the fortresses, damaging the unity of the enterprise. Al-Mu&#x27;azzam responded by reorganizing his reinforcements at Fariskur, upriver from al-&#x27;Adiliyah. Unknown to the Crusaders, Damietta could have been easily taken at this point due to illness and death among the defenders.

In the Holy Land, al-Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s forces began dismantling fortifications at Mount Tabor and other defensive positions, as well as Jerusalem itself, in order to deny their protection should the Crusaders prevail there. Al-Muzaffar II Mahmud, the son of the Ayyubid emir of Hama (and later emir himself), arrived in Egypt with Syrian reinforcements, leading multiple attacks on the Crusader camp through 7 April 1219, with little impact. In the meantime, Crusaders such as Leopold VI of Austria were returning to Europe, but were more than offset by new recruits, including Guy I Embriaco, who brought badly-needed supplies. Muslim attacks continued through May, with Crusader counterattacks utilizing a Lombardy device known as a &quot;carroccio&quot;, confounding the defenders.

Despite objections from the military leaders, Pelagius began multiple attacks on the city on 8 July 1219 using Pisan and Venetian troops. Each time they were repelled by the defenders, using Greek fire. A counteroffensive by the Egyptians on the Templar camp on 31 July was repulsed by their new leader Peire de Montagut, supported by the Teutonic Knights. Fighting continued into August when the waters of the Nile receded. An attack on the sultan&#x27;s camp at Fariskur on 29 August led by Pelagius&#x27; faction was a disaster, resulting in high losses for the Crusaders. The Marshal of the Hospitaller, Aymar de Lairon, and many Templars were killed. Only the intervention by John of Brienne, Ranulf de Blondeville, and the Templars and Hospitallers prevented further loss.

In August 1219, the sultan again offered peace, possibly out of desperation, using recent captives as envoys to the Christians. This included his earlier provisions plus paying for the restoration of the damaged fortifications, the return of the portion of the True Cross lost at the battle of Hattin and the release of prisoners. Again, his offer was rejected along familiar lines. Pelagius&#x27; view that victory was possible was supported by the continued arrival of new Crusades, most notably an English force led by Savari de Mauléon, a seneschal of the late John of England.

===Saint Francis in Egypt===

In September 1219, Francis of Assisi arrived in the Crusader camp seeking permission from Pelagius to visit sultan al-Kamil. Francis had a long history with the Crusades. In 1205, Francis prepared to enlist in the army of Walter III of Brienne (brother of John), diverted from the Fourth Crusade to fight in Italy. He returned to a life of the mendicants, later meeting with Innocent III who approved his religious order. After the Christian victory at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, he travelled to meet with Almohad caliph Muhammad an-Nāsir, ostensibly to convert him to Christianity. Francis did not make it to Morocco, only getting as far as Santiago de Compostela, he returned, sickened, but with a mission. His fabled experience with the wolf of Gubbio exemplified his view of the power of the cross.

Initially refusing the request, Pelagius granted Francis and his companion, Illuminato da Rieti, to go on what was assumed to be a suicide mission. They crossed over to preach to al-Kamil, who assumed that the holy men were emissaries of the Crusaders and received them courteously. When he discovered that their intent was instead to preach against the evils of Islam, some in his court demanded the execution of the friars. Al-Kamil instead heard them out and had them escorted back to the Crusader camp. Francis did obtain a commitment for more humane treatment for the Christian captives. It was claimed in a sermon by Bonaventure that the sultan converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of his meeting with Francis.

Francis remained in Egypt through the fall of Damietta, departing then for Acre. While there, he established the Province of the Holy Land, a priory of the Franciscan Order, obtaining for the friars the foothold they still retain as guardians of the holy places.

===Siege of Damietta===

With the negotiations with the Crusaders stalled and Damietta isolated, on 3 November 1219 al-Kamil sent a resupply convoy through the sector manned by the troops of the Frenchman Hervé IV of Donzy. The Egyptians were by and large stopped, some getting through to the city, resulting in the expulsion of Hervé. The intrusion energized the Crusaders with a unity of purpose.

On 5 November 1219, suspecting the city had been vacated, the Crusaders entered Damietta and found it abandoned, filled with the dead and with most of the remaining citizens ill. Seeing the Christian banners flying over the city, al-Kamil moved his host from Fariskur downriver to Mansurah. Survivors in the city were either sent into slavery or held as hostage to trade for Christian prisoners.

The fortifications of Damietta were essentially undamaged, and the victorious Crusaders claimed much booty. By 23 November 1219, they had captured the neighboring city of Tinnis, on the Tanitic mouth of the Nile, providing access to the food sources of Lake Manzala.

As usual, there was partisan struggles as to the rule of the city, secular or ecclesiastic. At some point, John of Brienne had enough, equipping three ships for departure. Pelagius relented, allowing John to lead Damietta pending a decision by the pope. Nevertheless, the Italians, feeling deprived of booty, took arms against the French and expelled them from the city. Not until 2 February 1220 did the situation stabilize, with a formal ceremony conducted to celebrate the Christian victory. John soon departed for the Holy Land, either piqued at Pelagius or to stake his claim to Armenia. Either way, Honorius III soon decided Damietta&#x27;s fate in favour of his legate Pelagius.

Among the casualties of the campaign for Damietta were Oliver, son of John Lackland, Milo IV of Puiset and his son Walter, and Hugh IX of Lusignan. Templar Guillaume de Chartres died of the plague before the siege began.

===John of Brienne returns to Jerusalem===
The father-in-law of John of Brienne, Leo I of Armenia, died on 2 May 1219, leaving his succession in doubt. John&#x27;s claim to the Armenian throne was through his wife Stephanie of Armenia and their infant son, and Leo I had instead left the kingdom to his infant daughter Isabella of Armenia. The pope decreed in February 1220 that John was the rightful heir to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. John left Damietta for Jerusalem around Easter 1220 in order to assert his claim to his inheritance. His departure had been rumored to be due to desertion which was not the case.

Stephanie and their son died shortly after John&#x27;s arrival, ending his claim to Cilicia. When Honorius III learned of their deaths, he declared Raymond-Roupen (whom Leo I had disinherited) the lawful ruler, threatening John with excommunication if he fought for Cilicia. To solidify his position, Raymond-Roupen travelled to Damietta in the summer of 1220 to meet with Pelagius.

After Damietta was captured, Walter of Caesarea had brought 100 Cypriote knights and their men-at-arms, including a Cypriote knight named Peter Chappe, and his charge, a young Philip of Novara. While in Egypt, Philip received instruction from the jurisconsult Ralph of Tiberias. In John&#x27;s absence, Pelagius left the sea routes between Damietta and Acre unguarded, and a Muslim fleet attacked the Crusaders in the port of Limassol, resulting in over a thousand casualties. Most of the Cypriotes departed Egypt at the same time as John. When he returned, he passed through Cyprus and brought some forces with him.

John remained in Jerusalem for several months, primarily due to lack of funds. Since his nephew Walter IV of Brienne was approaching the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne to him in 1221. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the Crusade on 6 July 1221 at the direction of the pope.

===Disaster at Mansurah===

The situation in Damietta after the February 1220 celebration was one of inactivity and discontent. The army lacked discipline despite Pelagius&#x27; draconian rule. His extensive regulations prevented adequate protection of the shipping lanes from Cyprus, and several ships carrying pilgrims were sunk. Many Crusaders departed, but were supplement by fresh troops including contingents led by the archbishop of Milan, Enrico da Settala, and the unnamed archbishop of Crete. This was the prelude to the disastrous battle of Mansurah of 1221 that would end the Crusade.

Late in 1220 or early in 1221, al-Kamil sent Fakhr ad-Din ibn as-Shaikh on an embassy to the court of al-Kamil&#x27;s brother al-Ashraf, now ruling greater Armenia from Sinjar, to request assistance against the Crusaders. He was at first refused. The Muslim world was now threatened also by the Mongols in Persia. When Abbasid caliph al-Nasir requested troops from al-Ashraf, however, the latter chose instead to send them assist his brother in Egypt. The Ayyubids regarded the Mongol ouster of Ala ad-Din Muhammad II, shah of the Khwarazmians, as destroying one of their main enemies, allowing them to focus on the invaders at Damietta.

In the captured city, Pelagius was unable to prod the Crusaders from their inactivity through the year 1220, save for a Templar raiding party on Burlus in July 1220. The town was pillaged, but at the cost of the loss and capture of numerous knights. The relative calm in Egypt enabled al-Mu&#x27;azzam, returning to Syria after the defeat at Damietta, to attack the remaining coastal strongholds, taking Caesarea. By October, he had further degraded the defenses of Jerusalem and unsuccessfully attacking Château Pèlerin, defended by Peire de Montagut and his Templars, recently released from their duty in Egypt.

Al-Kamil took advantage of this lull to reinforce Mansurah, once a small camp, into a fortified city that could perhaps replace Damietta as the protector of the mouth of the Nile. At some point, he renewed his peace offering to the Crusaders. Again it was refused, with Pelagius&#x27; view that he held the key to conquering not only Egypt but also Jerusalem. In December 1220, Honorius III announced that Frederick II would soon be sending troops, expected now in March 1221, with the newly crowned emperor leaving for Egypt in August. Some troops did arrive in May, led by Louis I of Bavaria and his bishop, Ulrich II of Passau, and under orders not to begin offensive operations until Frederick arrived.

Even before the capture of Damietta, the Crusaders became aware of a book, written in Arabic, which claims to have predicted Saladin&#x27;s earlier capture of Jerusalem and the impending Christian capture of Damietta. Based on this and other prophetic works, rumors circulated of a Christian uprising against the power of Islam, influencing the consideration of al-Kamil&#x27;s peace offerings. Then in July 1221, rumors began that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary Prester John, was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the Crusade and gain release of the sultan&#x27;s Christian captives. The story soon grew to such proportions and generated so much excitement among the Crusaders that it led them to prematurely launch an attack on Cairo. In reality, these rumors were conflated with the reality of Genghis Khan and the Mongol invasions of Persia.

On 4 July 1221 Pelagius, having decided to advance to the south, ordered a three-day fast in preparation for the advance. John of Brienne, arriving in Egypt shortly thereafter, argued against the move, but was powerless to stop it. Already deemed a traitor for opposing the plans and threatened with excommunication, John joined the force under the command of the legate. They moved towards Fariskur on 12 July where Pelagius drew it up in battle formation.

The Crusader force advanced to Sharamsah, half-way between Fariskur and Mansurah on the east bank of the Nile, occupying the city on 12 July 1221. John of Brienne again attempted to turn the legate back, but the Crusader force was intent on gaining great booty from Cairo, and John would likely have been put to death if he persisted. On 24 July, Pelagius moved his forces near the al-Bahr as-Saghit (Ushmum canal), south of the village of Ashmun al-Rumman, on the opposite bank from Mansurah. His plan was to maintain supply lines with Damietta, not bringing sufficient food for his large army.

The fortifications established were less than ideal, made worse by the reinforcements the Egyptians brought in from Syria. Alice of Cyprus and the leaders of the military orders warned Pelagius of the large numbers of Muslims troops arriving and continued warnings from John of Brienne went unheeded. Many Crusaders took this opportunity to retreat back to Damietta, later departing for home.

The Egyptians had the advantage of knowing the terrain, especially the canals near the Crusader camp. One such canal near Barāmūn (see maps of the area here and here) could support large vessels in late August when the Nile was at its crest, and they brought numerous ships up from al-Maḥallah. Entering the Nile, they were able to block the Crusaders&#x27; line of communications to Damietta, rendering their position untenable. In consultation with his military leaders, Pelagius ordered a retreat, only to find the route to Damietta blocked by the sultan&#x27;s troops.

On 26 August 1221, the Crusaders attempted to reach Barāmūn under the cover of darkness, but their carelessness alerted the Egyptians who set on them. They were also reluctant to sacrifice their stores of wine, drinking them rather than leave them. In the meantime, al-Kamil had the sluices along the right bank of the Nile opened, flooding the area and rendering battle impossible. On 28 August, Pelagius sued for peace, sending an envoy to al-Kamil.

The Crusaders still had some leverage. Damietta was well-garrisoned and a naval squadron under fleet admiral Henry of Malta, and Sicilian chancellor Walter of Palearia and German imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen, had been sent by Frederick II. They offered the sultan withdrawal from Damietta and an eight-year truce in exchange for allowing the Crusader army to pass, the release of all prisoners, and the return of the relic of the True Cross. Prior to the formal surrender of Damietta, the two sides would maintain hostages, among them John of Brienne and Hermann of Salza for the Franks side and as-Salih Ayyub, son of al-Kamil, for Egypt.

The masters of the military orders were dispatched to Damietta with the news of the surrender. It was not well-received, with the Venetians attempting to gain control, but the eventual happened on 8 September 1221. The Crusader ships departed and the sultan entered the city. The Fifth Crusade was over.

==Aftermath==
The Fifth Crusade ended with nothing gained for the West, with much loss of life, resources and reputations. Most were bitter that offensive operations were begun prior to the arrival of the emperor&#x27;s forces, and had opposed the treaty. Walter of Palearia was stripped of his possessions and sent into exile. Admiral Henry of Malta was imprisoned only to be pardoned later by Frederick II. John of Brienne demonstrated his inability to command an international army and was censured for essentially deserting the Crusade in 1220. Pelagius was accused of ineffectual leadership and a misguided view that led him to reject the sultan&#x27;s peace offering. The greatest criticism was leveled at Frederick II, whose ambition clearly lay in Europe not the Holy Land. The Crusade was unable to even gain the return of the piece of the True Cross. The Egyptians could not find it and the Crusaders left empty-handed.

The failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the Occitan poet Guilhem Figueira. The more orthodox Gormonda de Monpeslier responded to Figueira&#x27;s &quot;D&#x27;un sirventes far&quot; with a song of her own, &quot;Greu m&#x27;es a durar&quot;. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the &quot;foolishness&quot; of the wicked. The &quot;Palästinalied&quot; is a famous lyric poem by Walther von der Vogelweide written in Middle High German describing a pilgrim travelling to the Holy Land during the height of the Fifth Crusade.

==Participants==
A partial list of those that participated in the Fifth Crusade can be found in the category collections of Christians of the Fifth Crusade and Muslims of the Fifth Crusade.

==Historiography==
The of the Fifth Crusade is concerned with the &quot;history of the histories&quot; of the military campaigns discussed herein as well as biographies of the important figures of the period. The primary sources include works written in the medieval period, generally by participants in the Crusade or written contemporaneously with the event. The secondary sources begin with early consolidated works in the 16th century and continuing to modern times. The tertiary sources are primarily encyclopedias, bibliographies and biographies/genealogies.

The primary Western sources of the Fifth Crusade were first complied in &quot;Gesta Dei per Francos&quot; (God&#x27;s Work through the Franks) (1611), by French scholar and diplomat Jacques Bongars. These include several eyewitness accounts, and are as follows.

* &quot;Estoire d’Eracles émperor&quot; (History of Heraclius) is an anonymous history of Jerusalem down to 1277, a continuation of William of Tyre&#x27;s work and drawing from both Ernoul and the Rothelin Continuation.
*&quot;Historia Orientalis&quot; (&quot;Historia Hierosolymitana&quot;) and &quot;Epistolae,&quot; by theologian and historian Jacques de Vitry.
*&quot;Historia Damiatina,&quot; by Cardinal Oliver of Paderborn (&quot;Oliverus scholasticus&quot;) reflects his experience in the Crusade.
*&quot;De Itinere Frisonum&quot; is an eyewitness account of the Frisians&#x27; journey from Friesland to Acre.
*&quot;Flores Historiarum&quot;, by English chronicler Roger of Wendover, covering the period from 1188 through the Fifth Crusade.
*&quot;Gesta crucigerorum Rhenanorum&quot;, an account of the Rhineland Crusaders in 1220.
*&quot;Gesta Innocentii III,&quot; written by a member of the pope&#x27;s curia.
*&quot;Chronicon,&quot; by Richard of San Germano.

Other primary sources include:

*&quot;De expugnatione Salaciae carmen&quot; by Goswin of Bossut
*&quot;Gesta obsidionis Damiate&quot; by Giovanni Codagnello

The Arabic sources of the Crusade, partially compiled in the collection &quot;Recueil des historiens des&quot; &quot;croisades&quot;, &quot;Historiens orientaux&quot; (1872–1906), include the following.

* &quot;Complete Work of History&quot;, particularly &quot;The Years 589–629/1193–1231&quot;, by Ali ibn al-Athir, an Arab or Kurdish historian.
* &quot;Kitāb al-rawḍatayn&quot; (The Book of the Two Gardens) and its sequel &quot;al-Dhayl ʿalā l-rawḍatayn&quot;, by Arab historian Abū Shāma.
* &quot;Tarikh al-Mukhtasar fi Akhbar al-Bashar&quot; (History of Abu al-Fida), by Kurdish historian Abu’l-Fida.
* &quot;History of Egypt,&quot; by Egyptian historian Al-Makrizi.
*&quot;History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria,&quot; begun in the 10th century, and continued into the 13th century.

Many of these primary sources can be found in Crusade Texts in Translation. Fifteenth century Italian chronicler Francesco Amadi wrote his &quot;Chroniques d&#x27;Amadi&quot; that includes the Fifth Crusade based on the original sources. German historian Reinhold Röhricht also compiled two collections of works concerning the Fifth Crusade: &quot;Scriptores Minores Quinti Belli sacri&quot; (1879)&quot;&quot; and its continuation &quot;Testimonia minora de quinto bello sacro&quot; (1882). He also collaborated on the work &quot;Annales de Terre Sainte&quot; that provides a chronology of the Crusade correlated with the original sources.

The reference to the Fifth Crusade is relatively new. Thomas Fuller called it simply Voyage 8 in his &quot;The Historie of the Holy Warre&quot;. Joseph-François Michaud referred to it as part of the Sixth Crusade in his &quot;Histoire des Croisades&quot; (translation by British author William Robson), as did Joseph Toussaint Reinaud in his &quot;Histoire de la sixième croisade et de la prise de Damiette.&quot; Historian George Cox in his &quot;The&quot; &quot;Crusades&quot; regarded the Fifth and Sixth Crusades as a single campaign, but by the late 19th century, the designation of the Fifth Crusade was standard.

The secondary sources are well-represented in the Bibliography, below. Tertiary sources include works by Louis Bréhier in the Catholic Encyclopedia, Ernest Barker in the Encyclopædia Britannica, and Philip Schaff in the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge. Other works include The Mohammedan Dynasties by Stanley Lane-Poole and Bréhier&#x27;s &quot;Crusades (Bibliography and Sources)&quot;, a concise summary of the historiography of the Crusades.

<text>In mathematics, a Lie algebroid is a vector bundle formula_1 together with a Lie bracket on its space of sections formula_2 and a vector bundle morphism formula_3, satisfying a Leibniz rule. A Lie algebroid can thus be thought of as a &quot;many-object generalisation&quot; of a Lie algebra.

Lie algebroids play a similar same role in the theory of Lie groupoids that Lie algebras play in the theory of Lie groups: reducing global problems to infinitesimal ones. Indeed, any Lie groupoid gives rise to a Lie algebroid, which is the vertical bundle of the source map restricted at the units. However, unlike Lie algebras, not every Lie algebroid arises from a Lie groupoid.

Lie algebroids were introduced in 1967 by Jean Pradines.

==Definition and basic concepts==
A Lie algebroid is a triple formula_4 consisting of

* a vector bundle formula_5 over a manifold formula_6
* a Lie bracket formula_7 on its space of sections formula_8
* a morphism of vector bundles formula_9, called the anchor, where formula_10 is the tangent bundle of formula_6

such that the anchor and the bracket satisfy the following Leibniz rule:

:formula_12

where formula_13. Here formula_14 is the image of formula_15 via the derivation formula_16, i.e. the Lie derivative of formula_15 along the vector field formula_16. The notation formula_19 denotes the (point-wise) product between the function formula_14 and the vector field formula_21.

One often writes &quot;formula_22&quot; when the bracket and the anchor are clear from the context; some authors denote Lie algebroids by &quot;formula_23&quot;, suggesting a &quot;limit&quot; of a Lie groupoids when the arrows denoting source and target become &quot;infinitesimally close&quot;.

=== First properties ===
It follows from the definition that

* for every formula_24, the kernel formula_25 is a Lie algebra, called the isotropy Lie algebra at formula_26
*the kernel formula_27 is a (not necessarily locally trivial) bundle of Lie algebras, called the isotropy Lie algebra bundle
* the image formula_28 is a singular distribution which is integrable, i.e. its admits maximal immersed submanifolds formula_29, called the orbits, satisfying formula_30 for every formula_31. Equivalently, orbits can be explicitly described as the sets of points which are joined by A-paths, i.e. pairs formula_32 of paths in formula_5 and in formula_6 such that formula_35 and formula_36
* the anchor map formula_37 descends to a map between sections formula_38 which is a Lie algebra morphism, i.e.
:formula_39

for all formula_40.

The property that formula_37 induces a Lie algebra morphism was taken as an axiom in the original definition of Lie algebroid. Such redundancy, despite being known from an algebraic point of view already before Pradine&#x27;s definition, was noticed only much later.

=== Subalgebroids and ideals ===
A Lie subalgebroid of a Lie algebroid formula_4 is a vector subbundle formula_43 of the restriction formula_44 such that formula_45 takes values in formula_46 and formula_47 is a Lie subalgebra of formula_2. Clearly, formula_43 admits a unique Lie algebroid structure such that formula_50 is a Lie algebra morphism. With the language introduced below, the inclusion formula_51 is a Lie algebroid morphism.

A Lie subalgebroid is called wide if formula_52. In analogy to the standard definition for Lie algebra, an ideal of a Lie algebroid is wide Lie subalgebroid formula_53 such that formula_54 is a Lie ideal. Such notion proved to be very restrictive, since formula_55 is forced to be inside the isotropy bundle formula_56. For this reason, the more flexible notion of infinitesimal ideal system has been introduced.

=== Morphisms ===
A Lie algebroid morphism between two Lie algebroids formula_57 and formula_58 with the same base formula_6 is a vector bundle morphism formula_60 which is compatible with the Lie brackets, i.e. formula_61 for every formula_62, and with the anchors, i.e. formula_63.

A similar notion can be formulated for morphisms with different bases, but the compatibility with the Lie brackets becomes more involved. Equivalently, one can ask that the graph of formula_60 to be a subalgebroid of the direct product formula_65 (introduced below).

Lie algebroids together with their morphisms form a category.

== Examples ==

=== Trivial and extreme cases ===
* Given any manifold formula_6, its tangent Lie algebroid is the tangent bundle formula_67 together with the Lie bracket of vector fields and the identity of formula_10 as an anchor.
*Given any manifold formula_6, the zero vector bundle formula_70 is a Lie algebroid with zero bracket and anchor.
*Lie algebroids formula_71 over a point are the same thing as Lie algebras.
* More generally, any bundles of Lie algebras is Lie algebroid with zero anchor and Lie bracket defined pointwise.

=== Examples from differential geometry ===
* Given a foliation formula_72 on formula_6, its foliation algebroid is the associated involutive subbundle formula_74, with brackets and anchor induced from the tangent Lie algebroid.
* Given the action of a Lie algebra &quot;formula_75&quot; on a manifold formula_6, its action algebroid is the trivial vector bundle formula_77, with anchor given by the Lie algebra action and brackets uniquely determined by the bracket of formula_75 on constant sections formula_79 and by the Leibniz identity.
*Given a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle &quot;formula_80&quot; over a manifold &quot;formula_6&quot;, its Atiyah algebroid is the Lie algebroid formula_82 fitting in the following short exact sequence:
*:formula_83
: The space of sections of the Atiyah algebroid is the Lie algebra of &quot;formula_84&quot;-invariant vector fields on &quot;formula_80&quot;, its isotropy Lie algebra bundle is isomorphic to the adjoint vector bundle formula_86, and the right splittings of the sequence above are principal connections on &quot;formula_80.&quot;
*Given a vector bundle formula_88, its general linear algebroid, denoted by &quot;formula_89&quot; or &quot;formula_90&quot;, is the vector bundle whose sections are derivations of formula_91, i.e. first-order differential operators formula_92 admitting a vector field formula_93 such that formula_94 for every formula_95. The anchor is simply the assignment formula_96 and the Lie bracket is given by the commutator of differential operators.
*Given a Poisson manifold &quot;formula_97&quot;, its cotangent algebroid is the cotangent vector bundle &quot;formula_98&quot;, with Lie bracket &quot;formula_99&quot; and anchor map &quot;formula_100&quot;.
*Given a closed 2-form formula_101, the vector bundle &quot;formula_102&quot; is a Lie algebroid with anchor the projection on the first component and Lie bracket&quot;formula_103&quot;Actually, the bracket above can be defined for any 2-form formula_104, but formula_105 is a Lie algebroid if and only if formula_104 is closed.

=== Constructions from other Lie algebroids ===

* Given any Lie algebroid formula_107, there is a Lie algebroid formula_108, called its tangent algebroid, obtained by considering the tangent bundle of formula_5 and formula_6 and the differential of the anchor.
* Given any Lie algebroid formula_111, there is a Lie algebroid formula_112, called its k-jet algebroid, obtained by considering the k-jet bundle of formula_22, with Lie bracket uniquely defined by formula_114 and anchor formula_115.
*Given two Lie algebroids formula_116 and formula_117, their direct product is the unique Lie algebroid formula_118 with anchor formula_119 and such that formula_120 is a Lie algebra morphism.
*Given a Lie algebroid formula_111 and a map formula_122 whose differential is transverse to the anchor map formula_123 (for instance, it is enough for formula_15 to be a surjective submersion), the pullback algebroid is the unique Lie algebroid formula_125, with formula_126 the pullback vector bundle, and formula_127 the projection on the first component, such that formula_128 is a Lie algebroid morphism.

== Important classes of Lie algebroids ==

=== Totally intransitive Lie algebroids ===
A Lie algebroid is called totally intransitive if the anchor map formula_123 is zero.

Bundle of Lie algebras (hence also Lie algebras) are totally intransitive. This actually exhaust completely the list of totally intransitive Lie algebroids: indeed, if formula_5 is totally intransitive, it must coincide with its isotropy Lie algebra bundle.

=== Transitive Lie algebroids ===
A Lie algebroid is called transitive if the anchor map formula_123 is surjective. As a consequence:

* there is a short exact sequenceformula_132
* right-splitting of formula_37 defines a principal bundle connections on formula_56;
* the isotropy bundle formula_56 is locally trivial (as bundle of Lie algebras);
* the pullback of formula_5 exist for every formula_122.

The prototypical examples of transitive Lie algebroids are Atiyah algebroids. For instance:

* tangent algebroids formula_10 are trivially transitive (indeed, they are Atiyah algebroid of the principal formula_139-bundle formula_140)
* Lie algebras formula_75 are trivially transitive (indeed, they are Atiyah algebroid of the principal formula_84-bundle formula_143, for formula_84 an integration of formula_75)
* general linear algebroids formula_89 are transitive (indeed, they are Atiyah algebroids of the frame bundle formula_147)

In analogy to Atiyah algebroids, an arbitrary transitive Lie algebroid is also called abstract Atiyah sequence, and its isotropy algebra bundle formula_56 is also called adjoint bundle. However, it is important to stress that not every transitive Lie algebroid is an Atiyah algebroid. For instance:

* pullbacks of transitive algebroids are transitive
* cotangent algebroids formula_149 associated to Poisson manifolds &quot;formula_97&quot; are transitive if and only if the Poisson structure &quot;formula_151&quot; is non-degenerate
* Lie algebroids formula_105 defined by closed 2-forms are transitive

These examples are very relevant in the theory of integration of Lie algebroid (see below): while any Atiyah algebroid is integrable (to a gauge groupoid), not every transitive Lie algebroid is integrable.

=== Regular Lie algebroids ===
A Lie algebroid is called regular if the anchor map formula_123 is of constant rank. As a consequence

* the image of formula_37 defines a regular foliation on formula_6;
* the restriction of formula_5 over each leaf formula_157 is a transitive Lie algebroid.

For instance:

* any transitive Lie algebroid is regular (the anchor has maximal rank);
* any totally intransitive Lie algebroids is regular (the anchor has zero rank);
* foliation algebroids are always regular;
* cotangent algebroids formula_149 associated to Poisson manifolds &quot;formula_97&quot; are regular if and only if the Poisson structure &quot;formula_151&quot; is regular.

=== Actions ===
An action of a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot; on a manifold P along a smooth map &quot;formula_162&quot; consists of a Lie algebra morphismformula_163such that, for every &quot;formula_164&quot;,formula_165Of course, when &quot;formula_166&quot;, both the anchor &quot;formula_71&quot; and the map &quot;formula_168&quot; must be trivial, therefore both conditions are empty, and we recover the standard notion of action of a Lie algebra on a manifold.

=== Connections ===
Given a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot;, an A-connection on a vector bundle &quot;formula_88&quot; consists of an &quot;formula_171&quot;-bilinear mapformula_172which is &quot;formula_173&quot;-linear in the first factor and satisfies the following Leibniz rule:formula_174for every &quot;formula_175&quot;, where &quot;formula_176&quot; denotes the Lie derivative with respect to the vector field &quot;formula_177.&quot;

The curvature of an A-connection &quot;formula_178&quot; is the &quot;formula_173&quot;-bilinear mapformula_180and &quot;formula_178&quot; is called flat if &quot;formula_182.&quot;

Of course, when &quot;formula_183&quot;, we recover the standard notion of connection on a vector bundle, as well as those of curvature and flatness.

=== Representations ===
A representation of a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot; is a vector bundle &quot;formula_88&quot; together with a flat A-connection &quot;formula_178&quot;. Equivalently, a representation &quot;formula_187&quot; is a Lie algebroid morphism &quot;formula_188&quot;.

The set &quot;formula_189&quot; of isomorphism classes of representations of a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot; has a natural structure of semiring, with direct sums and tensor products of vector bundles.

Examples include the following:

* When &quot;formula_166&quot;, an &quot;formula_5&quot;-connection simplifies to a linear map &quot;formula_193&quot; and the flatness condition makes it into a Lie algebra morphism, therefore we recover the standard notion of representation of a Lie algebra.
* When &quot;formula_194&quot; and &quot;formula_195&quot; is a representation the Lie algebra formula_75, the trivial vector bundle &quot;formula_197&quot; is automatically a representation of &quot;formula_5&quot;
* Representations of the tangent algebroid &quot;formula_199&quot; are vector bundles endowed with flat connections
* Every Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot; has a natural representation on the line bundle &quot;formula_201&quot;, i.e. the tensor product between the determinant line bundles of &quot;formula_5 &quot;and of formula_149. One can associate a cohomology class in &quot;formula_204&quot; (see below) known as the modular class of the Lie algebroid. For the cotangent algebroid &quot;formula_205&quot; associated to a Poisson manifold &quot;formula_97&quot; one recovers the modular class of &quot;formula_151&quot;.

Note that there an arbitrary Lie groupoid does not have a canonical representation on its Lie algebroid, playing the role of the adjoint representation of Lie groups on their Lie algebras. However, this becomes possible if one allows the more general notion of representation up to homotopy.

=== Lie algebroid cohomology ===
Consider a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_22&quot; and a representation &quot;formula_187&quot;. Denoting by &quot;formula_210&quot; the space of &quot;formula_211&quot;-differential forms on &quot;formula_5&quot; with values in the vector bundle &quot;formula_91&quot;, one can define a differential &quot;formula_214&quot; with the following Koszul-like formula:formula_215Thanks to the flatness of &quot;formula_178&quot;, &quot;formula_217&quot; becomes a cochain complex and its cohomology, denoted by &quot;formula_218&quot;, is called the Lie algebroid cohomology of &quot;formula_5&quot; with coefficients in the representation &quot;formula_187&quot;.

This general definition recovers well-known cohomology theories:

* The cohomology of a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_221&quot; coincides with the Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of &quot;formula_75&quot; as a Lie algebra.
* The cohomology of a tangent Lie algebroid &quot;formula_67&quot; coincides with the de Rham cohomology of &quot;formula_6&quot;.
* The cohomology of a foliation Lie algebroid &quot;formula_225&quot; coincides with the leafwise cohomology of the foliation &quot;formula_72&quot;.
*The cohomology of the cotangent Lie algebroid &quot;formula_149&quot; associated to a Poisson structure &quot;formula_151&quot; coincides with the Poisson cohomology of &quot;formula_151.&quot;

== Lie groupoid-Lie algebroid correspondence ==
The standard construction which associates a Lie algebra to a Lie group generalises to this setting: to every Lie groupoid &quot;formula_230&quot; one can canonically associate a Lie algebroid &quot;formula_231&quot; defined as follows:

* the vector bundle is formula_232, where &quot;formula_233&quot; is the vertical bundle of the source fibre &quot;formula_234&quot; and &quot;formula_235&quot; is the groupoid unit map; 
* the sections of &quot;formula_5&quot; are identified with the right-invariant vector fields on &quot;formula_84&quot;, so that &quot;formula_2&quot; inherits a Lie bracket; 
* the anchor map is the differential formula_239 of the target map &quot;formula_240&quot;.

Of course, a symmetric construction arises when swapping the role of the source and the target maps, and replacing right- with left-invariant vector fields; an isomorphism between the two resulting Lie algebroids will be given by the differential of the inverse map formula_241.

The flow of a section &quot;formula_242&quot; is the 1-parameter bisection formula_243, defined by &quot;formula_244&quot;, where formula_245 is the flow of the corresponding right-invariant vector field &quot;formula_246&quot;. This allows one to defined the analogue of the exponential map for Lie groups as formula_247.

=== Lie functor ===
The mapping &quot;formula_248&quot; sending a Lie groupoid to a Lie algebroid is actually part of a categorical construction. Indeed, any Lie groupoid morphism &quot;formula_249 &quot;can be differentiated to a morphism&quot; formula_250&quot; between the associated Lie algebroids.

This construction defines a functor from the category of Lie groupoids and their morphisms to the category of Lie algebroids and their morphisms, called the Lie functor.

=== Structures and properties induced from groupoids to algebroids ===
Let formula_251 be a Lie groupoid and formula_252 its associated Lie algebroid. Then

* The isotropy algebras &quot;formula_253&quot; are the Lie algebras of the isotropy groups &quot;formula_254&quot;
* The orbits of &quot;formula_84&quot; coincides with the orbits of &quot;formula_5&quot;
* &quot;formula_84&quot; is transitive and &quot;formula_258&quot; is a submersion if and only if &quot;formula_5&quot; is transitive
* an action &quot;formula_260&quot; of &quot;formula_84&quot; on &quot;formula_262&quot; induces an action &quot;formula_263&quot; of &quot;formula_5&quot; (called infinitesimal action), defined by &quot;formula_265&quot;
* a representation of &quot;formula_84&quot; on a vector bundle &quot;formula_88&quot; induces a representation &quot;formula_178&quot; of &quot;formula_5&quot; on &quot;formula_88&quot;, defined by&quot;formula_271&quot;Moreover, there is a morphism of semirings &quot;formula_272&quot;, which becomes an isomorphism if &quot;formula_84&quot; is source-simply connected.
* there is a morphism formula_274, called Van Est morphism, from the differentiable cohomology of &quot;formula_84&quot; with coefficients in some representation on &quot;formula_91&quot; to the cohomology of &quot;formula_5&quot; with coefficients in the induced representation on &quot;formula_91&quot;. Moreover, if the &quot;formula_279&quot;-fibres of &quot;formula_84&quot; are homologically &quot;formula_211&quot;-connected, then &quot;formula_282&quot; is an isomorphism for &quot;formula_283&quot;, and is injective for &quot;formula_284&quot;.

=== Examples ===
* The Lie algebroid of a Lie group formula_285 is the Lie algebra formula_221
* The Lie algebroid of both the pair groupoid formula_287 and the fundamental groupoid formula_288 is the tangent algebroid formula_67 
* The Lie algebroid of the unit groupoid formula_290 is the zero algebroid formula_70
* The Lie algebroid of a Lie group bundle formula_230 is the Lie algebra bundle formula_22
* The Lie algebroid of an action groupoid formula_294 is the action algebroid formula_77
* The Lie algebroid of a gauge groupoid formula_296 is the Atiyah algebroid formula_297
* The Lie algebroid of a general linear groupoid formula_298 is the general linear algebroid formula_299
* The Lie algebroid of both the holonomy groupoid formula_300 and the monodromy groupoid formula_301 is the foliation algebroid formula_225
* The Lie algebroid of a tangent groupoid formula_303 is the tangent algebroid formula_304, for &quot;formula_305&quot;
* The Lie algebroid of a jet groupoid formula_306 is the jet algebroid formula_307, for &quot;formula_305&quot;

=== Detailed example 1 ===
Let us describe the Lie algebroid associated to the pair groupoid formula_309. Since the source map is formula_310, the formula_279-fibers are of the kind formula_312, so that the vertical space is formula_313. Using the unit map formula_314, one obtain the vector bundle formula_315.

The extension of sections &quot;formula_316&quot; to right-invariant vector fields &quot;formula_317&quot; is simply formula_318 and the extension of a smooth function &quot;formula_15&quot; from &quot;formula_6&quot; to a right-invariant function on &quot;formula_84&quot; is formula_322. Therefore, the bracket on &quot;formula_5&quot; is just the Lie bracket of tangent vector fields and the anchor map is just the identity.

=== Detailed example 2 ===
Consider the (action) Lie groupoid
:formula_324
where the target map (i.e. the right action of formula_325 on formula_326) is
:formula_327
The formula_279-fibre over a point formula_329 are all copies of formula_325, so that formula_331 is the trivial vector bundle formula_332.

Since its anchor map formula_333 is given by the differential of the target map, there are two cases for the isotropy Lie algebras, corresponding to the fibers of formula_334:
:formula_335
This demonstrates that the isotropy over the origin is formula_325, while everywhere else is zero.

== Integration of a Lie algebroid ==

=== Lie theorems ===
A Lie algebroid is called integrable if it is isomorphic to &quot;formula_231&quot; for some Lie groupoid&quot; formula_230&quot;. The analogue of the classical Lie I theorem states that:if &quot;formula_5&quot; is an integrable Lie algebroid, then there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) &quot;formula_279&quot;-simply connected Lie groupoid &quot;formula_84&quot; integrating &quot;formula_5&quot;.Similarly, a morphism &quot;formula_343&quot; between integrable Lie algebroids is called integrable if it is the differential &quot;formula_344&quot; for some morphism &quot;formula_249&quot; between two integrations of &quot;formula_346&quot; and &quot;formula_347&quot;. The analogue of the classical Lie II theorem states that: if &quot;formula_348&quot; is a morphism of integrable Lie algebroids, and &quot;formula_349&quot; is &quot;formula_279&quot;-simply connected, then there exists a unique morphism of Lie groupoids &quot;formula_249&quot; integrating &quot;formula_352&quot;.In particular, by choosing as &quot;formula_353&quot; the general linear groupoid &quot;formula_354&quot; of a vector bundle &quot;formula_91&quot;, it follows that any representation of an integrable Lie algebroid integrates to a representation of its &quot;formula_279&quot;-simply connected integrating Lie groupoid.

On the other hand, there is no analogue of the classical Lie III theorem, i.e. going back from any Lie algebroid to a Lie groupoid is not always possible. Pradines claimed that such a statement hold, and the first explicit example of non-integrable Lie algebroids, coming for instance from foliation theory, appeared only several years later. Despite several partial results, including a complete solution in the transitive case, the general obstructions for an arbitrary Lie algebroid to be integrable have been discovered only in 2003 by Crainic and Fernandes. Adopting a more general approach, one can see that every Lie algebroid integrates to a stacky Lie groupoid.

=== Ševera-Weinstein groupoid ===
Given any Lie algebroid &quot;formula_5&quot;, the natural candidate for an integration is given by &quot;formula_358&quot;, where &quot;formula_359&quot; denotes the space of &quot;formula_5&quot;-paths and &quot;formula_361&quot; the relation of &quot;formula_5&quot;-homotopy between them. This is often called the Weinstein groupoid or Ševera-Weinstein groupoid.

Indeed, one can show that &quot;formula_363&quot; is an &quot;formula_279&quot;-simply connected topological groupoid, with the multiplication induced by the concatenation of paths. Moreover, if &quot;formula_5&quot; is integrable, &quot;formula_363&quot; admits a smooth structure such that it coincides with the unique &quot;formula_279&quot;-simply connected Lie groupoid integrating &quot;formula_5&quot;.

Accordingly, the only obstruction to integrability lies in the smoothness of &quot;formula_363&quot;. This approach led to the introduction of objects called monodromy groups, associated to any Lie algebroid, and to the following fundamental result: A Lie algebroid is integrable if and only if its monodromy groups are uniformly discrete.Such statement simplifies in the transitive case:A transitive Lie algebroid is integrable if and only if its monodromy groups are discrete.The results above show also that every Lie algebroid admits an integration to a &quot;local&quot; Lie groupoid (roughly speaking, a Lie groupoid where the multiplication is defined only in a neighbourhood around the identity elements).

=== Integrable examples ===

* Lie algebras are always integrable (by Lie III theorem)
* Atiyah algebroids of a principal bundle are always integrable (to the gauge groupoid of that principal bundle)
* Lie algebroids with injective anchor (hence foliation algebroids) are alway integrable (by Frobenius theorem)
* Lie algebra bundle are always integrable
* Action Lie algebroids are always integrable (but the integration is not necessarily an action Lie groupoid)
* Any Lie subalgebroid of an integrable Lie algebroid is integrable.

=== A non-integrable example ===
Consider the Lie algebroid formula_370 associated to a closed 2-form formula_101 and the group of spherical periods associated to formula_104, i.e. the image formula_373 of the following group homomorphism from the second homotopy group of formula_6

formula_375

Since formula_105 is transitive, it is integrable if and only if it is the Atyah algebroid of some principal bundle; a careful analysis shows that this happens if and only if the subgroup formula_377 is a lattice, i.e. it is discrete. An explicit example where such condition fails is given by taking formula_378 and formula_379 for formula_380 the area form. Here formula_381 turns out to be formula_382, which is dense in formula_171.

<doc id="310923" wikidata="Q6543824" url="?curid=310923" title="Lie groupoid">
<text>In mathematics, a Lie groupoid is a groupoid where the set formula_1 of objects and the set formula_2 of morphisms are both manifolds, all the category operations (source and target, composition, identity-assigning map and inversion) are smooth, and the source and target operations

:formula_3

are submersions.

A Lie groupoid can thus be thought of as a &quot;many-object generalization&quot; of a Lie group, just as a groupoid is a many-object generalization of a group. Accordingly, while Lie groups provide a natural model for (classical) continuous symmetries, Lie groupoids are often used as model for (and arise from) generalised, point-dependent symmetries. Extending the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras, Lie groupoids are the global counterparts of Lie algebroids.

Lie groupoids were introduced by Charles Ehresmann under the name &quot;differentiable groupoids&quot;.

== Definition and basic concepts ==
A Lie groupoid consists of

* two smooth manifolds formula_4 and formula_5
* two surjective submersions formula_6 (called, respectively, source and target projections)
* a map formula_7 (called multiplication or composition map), where we use the notation formula_8
* a map formula_9 (called unit map or object inclusion map), where we use the notation formula_10
* a map formula_11 (called inversion), where we use the notation formula_12

such that

* the composition satisfies formula_13 and formula_14 for every formula_15 for which the composition is defined
*the composition is associative, i.e. formula_16 for every formula_17 for which the composition is defined
* formula_18 works as an identity, i.e. formula_19 for every formula_20 and formula_21 and formula_22 for every formula_23
* formula_24 works as an inverse, i.e. formula_25 and formula_26 for every formula_23.

Using the language of category theory, a Lie groupoid can be more compactly defined as a groupoid (i.e. a small category where all the morphisms are invertible) such that the sets formula_5 of objects and formula_4 of morphisms are manifolds, the maps formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_33 and formula_34 are smooth and formula_30 and formula_31 are submersions. A Lie groupoid is therefore not simply a groupoid object in the category of smooth manifolds: one has to ask the additional property that formula_30 and formula_31 are submersions.

Lie groupoids are often denoted by formula_39, where the two arrows represent the source and the target. The notation formula_40 is also frequently used, especially when stressing the simplicial structure of the associated nerve.

In order to include more natural examples, the manifold formula_4 is not required in general to be Hausdorff or second countable (while formula_5 and all other spaces are).

=== Alternative definitions ===
The original definition by Ehresmann required formula_4 and formula_5 to possess a smooth structure such that only formula_32 is smooth and the maps formula_46 and formula_47 are subimmersions (i.e. have locally constant rank). Such definition proved to be too weak and was replaced by Pradines with the one currently used.

While some authors introduced weaker definitions which did not require formula_30 and formula_31 to be submersions, these properties are fundamental to develop the entire Lie theory of groupoids and algebroids.

=== First properties ===
The fact that the source and the target map of a Lie groupoid formula_50 are smooth submersions has some immediate consequences:
* the formula_30-fibres formula_52, the formula_31-fibres formula_54, and the set of composable morphisms formula_55 are submanifolds;
* the inversion map formula_33 is a diffeomorphism;
*the unit map formula_34 is a smooth embedding;
*the isotropy groups formula_58 are Lie groups;
* the orbits formula_59 are immersed submanifolds;
* the formula_30-fibre formula_61 at a point formula_20 is a principal formula_58-bundle over the orbit formula_64 at that point.

=== Subobjects and morphisms ===
A Lie subgroupoid of a Lie groupoid formula_50 is a subgroupoid formula_66 (i.e. a subcategory of the category formula_4) with the extra requirement that formula_68 is an immersed submanifold. As for a subcategory, a (Lie) subgroupoid is called wide if formula_69. Any Lie groupoid formula_50 has two canonical wide subgroupoids:

* the unit/identity Lie subgroupoid formula_71;
* the inner subgroupoid formula_72, i.e. the bundle of isotropy groups (which however may fail to be smooth in general).

A normal Lie subgroupoid is a wide Lie subgroupoid formula_68 inside formula_74 such that, for every formula_75 with formula_76, one has formula_77. The isotropy groups of formula_78 are therefore normal subgroups of the isotropy groups of formula_4.

A Lie groupoid morphism between two Lie groupoids formula_50 and formula_66 is a groupoid morphism formula_82 (i.e. a functor between the categories formula_4 and formula_78), where both formula_85 and formula_86 are smooth. The kernel formula_87 of a morphism between Lie groupoids over the same base manifold is automatically a normal Lie subgroupoid.

The quotient formula_88 has a natural groupoid structure such that the projection formula_89 is a groupoid morphism; however, unlike quotients of Lie groups, formula_90 may fail to be a Lie groupoid in general. Accordingly, the isomorphism theorems for groupoids cannot be specialised to the entire category of Lie groupoids, but only to special classes.

A Lie groupoid is called abelian if its isotropy Lie groups are abelian. For similar reasons as above, while the definition of abelianisation of a group extends to set-theoretical groupoids, in the Lie case the analogue of the quotient formula_91 may not exist or be smooth.

=== Bisections ===
A bisection of a Lie groupoid formula_50 is a smooth map formula_93 such that formula_94 and formula_95 is a diffeomorphism of formula_5. In order to overcome the lack of symmetry between the source and the target, a bisection can be equivalently defined as a submanifold formula_97 such that formula_98 and formula_99 are diffeomorphisms; the relation between the two definitions is given by formula_100.

The set of bisections forms a group, with the multiplication formula_101 defined asformula_102and inversion defined asformula_103Note that the definition is given in such a way that, if formula_104 and formula_105, then formula_106 and formula_107.

The group of bisections can be given the compact-open topology, as well as an (infinite-dimensional) structure of Fréchet manifold compatible with the group structure, making it into a Fréchet-Lie group.

A local bisection formula_108 is defined analogously, but the multiplication between local bisections is of course only partially defined.

==Examples==

=== Trivial and extreme cases ===
*Lie groupoids formula_109 with one object are the same thing as Lie groups.
*Given any manifold formula_5, there is a Lie groupoid formula_111 called the pair groupoid, with precisely one morphism from any object to any other.
*The two previous examples are particular cases of the trivial groupoid formula_112, with structure maps formula_113, formula_114, formula_115, formula_116 and formula_117. 
*Given any manifold formula_5, there is a Lie groupoid formula_119 called the unit groupoid, with precisely one morphism from one object to itself, namely the identity, and no morphisms between different objects.
*More generally, Lie groupoids with formula_120 are the same thing as bundle of Lie groups (not necessarily locally trivial). For instance, any vector bundle is a bundle of abelian groups, so it is in particular a(n abelian) Lie groupoid.

=== Constructions from other Lie groupoids ===
*Given any Lie groupoid formula_50 and a surjective submersion formula_122, there is a Lie groupoid formula_123, called its pullback groupoid or induced groupoid, where formula_124 contains triples formula_125 such that formula_126 and formula_127, and the multiplication is defined using the multiplication of formula_4. For instance, the pullback of the pair groupoid of formula_5 is the pair groupoid of formula_130.
*Given any two Lie groupoids formula_131 and formula_132, there is a Lie groupoid formula_133, called their direct product, such that the groupoid morphisms formula_134 and formula_135 are surjective submersions.
*Given any Lie groupoid formula_50, there is a Lie groupoid formula_137, called its tangent groupoid, obtained by considering the tangent bundle of formula_4 and formula_5 and the differential of the structure maps.
*Given any Lie groupoid formula_50, there is a Lie groupoid formula_141, called its cotangent groupoid obtained by considering the cotangent bundle of formula_4, the dual of the Lie algebroid formula_143 (see below), and suitable structure maps involving the differentials of the left and right translations.
*Given any Lie groupoid formula_50, there is a Lie groupoid formula_145, called its jet groupoid, obtained by considering the k-jets of the local bisections of formula_4 (with smooth structure inherited from the jet bundle of formula_147) and setting formula_148, formula_149, formula_150, formula_151 and formula_152.

=== Examples from differential geometry ===
*Given a submersion formula_153, there is a Lie groupoid formula_154, called the submersion groupoid or fibred pair groupoid, whose structure maps are induced from the pair groupoid formula_111 (the condition that formula_156 is a submersion ensures the smoothness of formula_157). If formula_130 is a point, one recovers the pair groupoid.
*Given a Lie group formula_4 acting on a manifold formula_5, there is a Lie groupoid formula_161, called the action groupoid or translation groupoid, with one morphism for each triple formula_162 with formula_163.
*Given any vector bundle formula_164, there is a Lie groupoid formula_165, called the general linear groupoid, with morphisms between formula_166 being linear isomorphisms between the fibres formula_167 and formula_168. For instance, if formula_169 is the trivial vector bundle of rank formula_170, then formula_165 is the action groupoid.
*Any principal bundle formula_172 with structure group &quot;formula_4&quot; defines a Lie groupoid formula_174, where &quot;formula_4&quot; acts on the pairs formula_176 componentwise, called the gauge groupoid. The multiplication is defined via compatible representatives as in the pair groupoid.
*Any foliation formula_177 on a manifold formula_5 defines two Lie groupoids, formula_179 (or formula_180) and formula_181, called respectively the monodromy/homotopy/fundamental groupoid and the holonomy groupoid of formula_177, whose morphisms consist of the homotopy, respectively holonomy, equivalence classes of paths entirely lying in a leaf of formula_177. For instance, when formula_177 is the trivial foliation with only one leaf, one recovers, respectively, the fundamental groupoid and the pair groupoid of formula_5. On the other hand, when formula_177 is a simple foliation, i.e. the foliation by (connected) fibres of a submersion formula_153, its holonomy groupoid is precisely the submersion groupoid formula_157 but its monodromy groupoid may even fail to be Hausdorff, due to a general criterion in terms of vanishing cycles. In general, many elementary foliations give rise to monodromy and holonomy groupoids which are not Hausdorff.
*Given any pseudogroup formula_189, there is a Lie groupoid formula_190, called its germ groupoid, endowed with the sheaf topology and with structure maps analogous to those of the jet groupoid. This is another natural example of Lie groupoid whose arrow space is not Hausdorff nor second countable.

== Important classes of Lie groupoids ==
Note that some of the following classes make sense already in the category of set-theoretical or topological groupoids.

=== Transitive groupoids ===
A Lie groupoid is transitive (in older literature also called connected) if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

* there is only one orbit;
* there is at least a morphism between any two objects;
* the map formula_191 (also known as the anchor of formula_50) is surjective.

Gauge groupoids constitute the prototypical examples of transitive Lie groupoids: indeed, any transitive Lie groupoid is isomorphic to the gauge groupoid of some principal bundle, namely the formula_58-bundle formula_194, for any point formula_20. For instance:

* the trivial Lie groupoid formula_112 is transitive and arise from the trivial principal formula_4-bundle formula_198. As particular cases, Lie groups formula_109 and pair groupoids formula_111 are trivially transitive, and arise, respectively, from the principal formula_4-bundle formula_202, and from the principal formula_203-bundle formula_204;
* an action groupoid formula_161 is transitive if and only if the group action is transitive, and in such case it arises from the principal bundle formula_206 with structure group the isotropy group (at an arbitrary point);
* the general linear groupoid of formula_207 is transitive, and arises from the frame bundle formula_208;
*pullback groupoids, jet groupoids and tangent groupoids of formula_50 are transitive if and only if formula_50 is transitive.

As a less trivial instance of the correspondence between transitive Lie groupoids and principal bundles, consider the fundamental groupoid formula_211 of a (connected) smooth manifold formula_5. This is naturally a topological groupoid, which is moreover transitive; one can see that formula_211 is isomorphic to the gauge groupoid of the universal cover of formula_5. Accordingly, formula_211 inherits a smooth structure which makes it into a Lie groupoid.

Submersions groupoids formula_216 are an example of non-transitive Lie groupoids, whose orbits are precisely the fibres of formula_156.

A stronger notion of transitivity requires the anchor formula_191 to be a surjective submersion. Such condition is also called local triviality, because formula_4 becomes locally isomorphic (as Lie groupoid) to a trivial groupoid over any open formula_220 (as a consequence of the local triviality of principal bundles).

When the space formula_4 is second countable, transitivity implies local triviality. Accordingly, these two conditions are equivalent for many examples but not for all of them: for instance, if formula_222 is a transitive pseudogroup, its germ groupoid formula_223 is transitive but not locally trivial.

=== Proper groupoids ===
A Lie groupoid is called proper if formula_191 is a proper map. As a consequence

* all isotropy groups of formula_4 are compact;
* all orbits of formula_4 are closed submanifolds;
* the orbit space formula_227 is Hausdorff.

For instance:

* a Lie group is proper if and only if it is compact;
* pair groupoids are always proper;
*unit groupoids are always proper;
* an action groupoid is proper if and only if the action is proper;
*the fundamental groupoid is proper if and only if the fundamental groups are finite.
As seen above, properness for Lie groupoids is the &quot;right&quot; analogue of compactness for Lie groups. One could also consider more &quot;natural&quot; conditions, e.g. asking that the source map formula_147 is proper (then formula_50 is called s-proper), or that the entire space formula_4 is compact (then formula_50 is called compact), but these requirements turns out to be too strict for many examples and applications.

=== Étale groupoids ===
A Lie groupoid is called étale if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:

* the dimensions of formula_4 and formula_5 are equal;
* formula_30 is a local diffeomorphism;
* all the formula_30-fibres are discrete

As a consequence, also the formula_31-fibres, the isotropy groups and the orbits become discrete.

For instance:

* a Lie group is étale if and only if it is discrete;
*pair groupoids are never étale;
*unit groupoids are always étale;
*an action groupoid is étale if and only if formula_4 is discrete;
* germ groupoids of pseudogroups are always étale.

=== Effective groupoids ===
An étale groupoid is called effective if, for any two local bisections formula_238, the condition formula_239 implies formula_240. For instance:

* Lie groups are effective if and only if are trivial;
*unit groupoids are always effective;
*an action groupoid is effective if the formula_4-action is free and formula_4 is discrete.
In general, any effective étale groupoid arise as the germ groupoid of some pseudogroup. However, a (more involved) definition of effectiveness, which does not assume the étale property, can also be given.

=== Source-connected groupoids ===
A Lie groupoid is called formula_30-connected if all its formula_30-fibres are connected. Similarly, one talks about formula_30-simply connected groupoids (when the formula_30-fibres are simply connected) or source-k-connected groupoids (when the formula_30-fibres are k-connected, i.e. the first formula_170 homotopy groups are trivial).

Note that the entire space of arrows formula_4 is not asked to satisfy any connectedness hypothesis. However, if formula_4 is a source-formula_170-connected Lie groupoid over a formula_170-connected manifold, then formula_4 itself is automatically formula_170-connected.

For instanceː

* Lie groups are source formula_170-connected if and only if they are formula_170-connected;
* a pair groupoid is source formula_170-connected if and only if formula_5 is formula_170-connected;
* unit groupoids are always source formula_170-connected;
* action groupoids are source formula_170-connected if and only if formula_4 is formula_170-connected;
* monodromy groupoids (hence also fundamental groupoids) are source simply connected;
* a gauge groupoid associated to a principal bundle formula_172 is source formula_170-connected if and only if the total space formula_266 is.

== Further related concepts ==
=== Actions and principal bundles ===
Recall that an action of a groupoid formula_50 on a set formula_266 along a function formula_269 is defined via a collection of maps formula_270 for each morphism formula_23 between formula_166. Accordingly, an action of a Lie groupoid formula_50 on a manifold formula_266 along a smooth map formula_269 consists of a groupoid action where the maps formula_276 are smooth. Of course, for every formula_20 there is an induced smooth action of the isotropy group formula_58 on the fibre formula_279.

Given a Lie groupoid formula_50, a principal formula_4-bundle consists of a formula_4-space formula_266 and a formula_4-invariant surjective submersion formula_285 such thatformula_286is a diffeomorphism. Equivalent (but more involved) definitions can be given using formula_4-valued cocycles or local trivialisations.

When formula_4 is a Lie groupoid over a point, one recovers, respectively, standard Lie group actions and principal bundles.

=== Representations ===
A representation of a Lie groupoid formula_50 consists of a Lie groupoid action on a vector bundle formula_290, such that the action is fibrewise linear, i.e. each bijection formula_291 is a linear isomorphism. Equivalently, a representation of formula_4 on formula_207 can be described as a Lie groupoid morphism from formula_4 to the general linear groupoid formula_295.

Of course, any fibre formula_167 becomes a representation of the isotropy group formula_58. More generally, representations of transitive Lie groupoids are uniquely determined by representations of their isotropy groups, via the construction of the associated vector bundle.

Examples of Lie groupoids representations include the following:

* representations of Lie groups formula_109 recover standard Lie group representations
* representations of pair groupoids formula_111 are trivial vector bundles
* representations of unit groupoids formula_300 are vector bundles
* representations of action groupoid formula_161 are formula_4-equivariant vector bundles
* representations of fundamental groupoids formula_211 are vector bundles endowed with flat connections

The set formula_304 of isomorphism classes of representations of a Lie groupoid formula_50 has a natural structure of semiring, with direct sums and tensor products of vector bundles.

=== Differentiable cohomology ===
The notion of differentiable cohomology for Lie groups generalises naturally also to Lie groupoids: the definition relies on the simplicial structure of the nerve formula_306 of formula_50, viewed as a category.

More precisely, recall that the space formula_308 consists of strings of formula_309 composable morphisms, i.e.

formula_310

and consider the map formula_311.

A differentiable &quot;formula_309&quot;-cochain of formula_50 with coefficients in some representation formula_314 is a smooth section of the pullback vector bundle formula_315. One denotes by formula_316 the space of such &quot;formula_309&quot;-cochains, and considers the differential formula_318, defined as

formula_319

Then formula_320 becomes a cochain complex and its cohomology, denoted by formula_321, is called the differentiable cohomology of formula_50 with coefficients in formula_314. Note that, since the differential at degree zero is formula_324, one has always formula_325.

Of course, the differentiable cohomology of formula_109 as a Lie groupoid coincides with the standard differentiable cohomology of formula_4 as a Lie group (in particular, for discrete groups one recovers the usual group cohomology). On the other hand, for any &quot;proper&quot; Lie groupoid formula_50, one can prove that formula_329 for every formula_330.

=== The Lie algebroid of a Lie groupoid ===

Any Lie groupoid formula_50 has an associated Lie algebroid formula_332, obtained with a construction similar to the one which associates a Lie algebra to any Lie groupː

* the vector bundle formula_332 is the vertical bundle with respect to the source map, restricted to the elements tangent to the identities, i.e. formula_334;
* the Lie bracket is obtained by identifying formula_335 with the left-invariant vector fields on formula_4, and by transporting their Lie bracket to formula_143;
* the anchor map formula_338 is the differential of the target map formula_339 restricted to formula_143.

The Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence generalises to some extends also to Lie groupoids: the first two Lie&#x27;s theorem (also known as the subgroups–subalgebras theorem and the homomorphisms theorem) can indeed be easily adapted to this setting.

In particular, as in standard Lie theory, for any s-connected Lie groupoid formula_4 there is a unique (up to isomorphism) s-simply connected Lie groupoid formula_342 with the same Lie algebroid of formula_4, and a local diffeomorphism formula_344 which is a groupoid morphism. For instance,

* given any connected manifold formula_5 its pair groupoid formula_346 is s-connected but not s-simply connected, while its fundamental groupoid formula_211 is. They both have the same Lie algebroid, namely the tangent bundle formula_348, and the local diffeomorphism formula_349 is given by formula_350.
* given any foliation formula_177 on formula_5, its holonomy groupoid formula_353 is s-connected but not s-simply connected, while its monodromy groupoid formula_354 is. They both have the same Lie algebroid, namely the foliation algebroid formula_355, and the local diffeomorphism formula_356 is given by formula_357 (since the homotopy classes are smaller than the holonomy ones).

However, there is no analogue of Lie&#x27;s third theoremː while several classes of Lie algebroids are integrable, there are examples of Lie algebroids, for instance related to foliation theory, which do not admit an integrating Lie groupoid. The general obstructions to the existence of such integration depend on the topology of formula_4.

==Morita equivalence==
As discussed above, the standard notion of (iso)morphism of groupoids (viewed as functors between categories) restricts naturally to Lie groupoids. However, there is a more coarse notion of equivalence, called Morita equivalence, which is more flexible and useful in applications.

First, a Morita map (also known as a weak equivalence or essential equivalence) between two Lie groupoids formula_359 and formula_360 consists of a Lie groupoid morphism from G to H which is moreover fully faithful and essentially surjective (adapting these categorical notions to the smooth context). We say that two Lie groupoids formula_361 and formula_360 are Morita equivalent if and only if there exists a third Lie groupoid formula_363 together with two Morita maps from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;K&quot; and from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;K&quot;.

A more explicit description of Morita equivalence (e.g. useful to check that it is an equivalence relation) requires the existence of two surjective submersions formula_364 and formula_365 together with a left formula_4-action and a right formula_78-action, commuting with each other and making formula_266 into a principal bi-bundle.

=== Morita invariance ===
Many properties of Lie groupoids, e.g. being proper, being Hausdorff or being transitive, are Morita invariant. On the other hand, being étale is not Morita invariant.

In addition, a Morita equivalence between formula_361 and formula_360 preserves their &quot;transverse geometry&quot;, i.e. it induces:

* a homeomorphism between the orbit spaces formula_371 and formula_372;
* an isomorphism formula_373 between the isotropy groups at corresponding points formula_374 and formula_375;
* an isomorphism formula_376 between the normal representations of the isotropy groups at corresponding points formula_374 and formula_375.
Last, the differentiable cohomologies of two Morita equivalent Lie groupoids are isomorphic.

=== Examples ===

* Isomorphic Lie groupoids are trivially Morita equivalent.
* Two Lie groups are Morita equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic as Lie groups.
*Two unit groupoids are Morita equivalent if and only if the base manifolds are diffeomorphic.
* Any transitive Lie groupoid is Morita equivalent to its isotropy groups.
* Given a Lie groupoid formula_379 and a surjective submersion formula_380, the pullback groupoid formula_123 is Morita equivalent to formula_379.
* Given a free and proper Lie group action of formula_4 on formula_5 (therefore the quotient formula_227 is a manifold), the action groupoid formula_161 is Morita equivalent to the unit groupoid formula_387.
* A Lie groupoid formula_4 is Morita equivalent to an étale groupoid if and only if all isotropy groups of formula_4 are discrete.

A concrete instance of the last example goes as follows. Let &quot;M&quot; be a smooth manifold and formula_390 an open cover of &quot;formula_5&quot;. Its Čech groupoid formula_361 is defined by the disjoint unions formula_393 and formula_394, where formula_395. The source and target map are defined as the embeddings formula_396 and formula_397, and the multiplication is the obvious one if we read the formula_398 as subsets of &quot;M&quot; (compatible points in formula_398 and formula_400 actually are the same in &quot;formula_5&quot; and also lie in formula_402). The Čech groupoid is in fact the pullback groupoid, under the obvious submersion formula_403&quot;,&quot; of the unit groupoid formula_404. As such, Čech groupoids associated to different open covers of &quot;formula_5&quot; are Morita equivalent.

=== Smooth stacks ===
Investigating the structure of the orbit space of a Lie groupoid leads to the notion of a smooth stack. For instance, the orbit space is a smooth manifold if the isotropy groups are trivial (as in the example of the Čech groupoid), but it is not smooth in general. The solution is to revert the problem and to define a smooth stack as a Morita-equivalence class of Lie groupoids. The natural geometric objects living on the stack are the geometric objects on Lie groupoids invariant under Morita-equivalence: an example is the Lie groupoid cohomology.

Since the notion of smooth stack is quite general, obviously all smooth manifolds are smooth stacks. Other classes of examples include orbifolds, which are (equivalence classes of) proper étale Lie groupoids, and orbit spaces of foliations.

<text>Einherjer is a Viking metal band from Haugesund, Norway, founded in 1993. Some of the band&#x27;s albums are heavily folk influenced, while others have a more traditional symphonic black metal sound. Their lyrics retell Norse legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. The band split up in early 2004 after releasing the album &quot;Blot&quot; in December 2003, but later reformed.

In December 2004, all members of Einherjer&#x27;s last lineup, including the band&#x27;s founders Frode Glesnes and Gerhard Storesund, founded the thrash metal band Battered together with bass guitarist Ole Moldesæther.

In September 2008, Einherjer announced that they would reunite to do some selected shows across Europe in 2009, including the Ragnarök, Kaltenbach and Wacken festivals. The band signed with Indie Recordings in December 2010; their first album in eight years, &quot;Norrøn&quot; was released in September 2011. Einherjer has since released three more studio albums, and the latest one, &quot;North Star&quot;, was released on February 26, 2021.

==Name==
The band&#x27;s name is taken from Norse mythology, where the term Einherjar describes the slain warriors who have gone to Valhalla and joined Odin&#x27;s table.

==Battered==
The band was reconstituted in 2004 as &quot;Battered&quot;, a thrash band that included Glesnes, Storesund, and Herløe. A new vocalist joined them in 2005, Siggy Olaisen, The band only released one demo, &quot;...Beyond Recognition&quot;, and one album—also named &quot;Battered&quot;—before disbanding. The self-titled debut album was released February 27, 2006, in Norway; and March 13 in the rest of Europe. The American release date for the album was April 4, 2006.

<doc id="310928" wikidata="Q588806" url="?curid=310928" title="Integer BASIC">
<text>Integer BASIC is a BASIC interpreter written by Steve Wozniak for the Apple I and Apple II computers. Originally available on cassette for the Apple I in 1976, then included in ROM on the Apple II from its release in 1977, it was the first version of BASIC used by many early home computer owners.

The only numeric data type was the integer; floating-point numbers were not supported. Using integers allowed numbers to be stored in a compact 16-bit format that could be more rapidly read and processed than the 32- or 40-bit floating-point formats found in most BASICs of the era. This made it so fast that Bill Gates complained when it outperformed Microsoft BASIC in benchmarks. However, this also limited its applicability as a general-purpose language.

Another difference with other BASICs of the era is that Integer BASIC treated strings as arrays of characters, similar to the system in C or Fortran 77. Substrings were accessed using array slicing rather than string functions. This style was introduced in HP Time-Shared BASIC, and could also be found in other contemporary BASICs patterned on HP, like North Star BASIC and Atari BASIC. It contrasted with the style found in BASICs derived from DEC, including Microsoft BASIC.

The language was initially developed under the name GAME BASIC and referred to simply as Apple BASIC when it was introduced on the Apple I. It became Integer BASIC when it was ported to the Apple II and shipped alongside Applesoft BASIC, a port of Microsoft BASIC which included floating-point support. Integer BASIC was phased out in favor of Applesoft BASIC starting with the Apple II Plus in 1979.

==History==
As a senior in high school, Steve Wozniak&#x27;s electronics teacher arranged for the leading students in the class to have placements at local electronics companies. Wozniak was sent to Sylvania where he programmed in FORTRAN on an IBM 1130. That same year, General Electric placed a terminal in the high school that was connected to one of their mainframes running their time-sharing BASIC service, which they were heavily promoting at the time. After being given three days of access, the students were asked to write letters on why the school should receive a terminal permanently, but their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.

Some years later, Wozniak was working at Hewlett-Packard (HP) running simulations of chip designs and logic layout for calculators. HP made major inroads in the minicomputer market with their HP 2000 series machines running a custom timesharing version of BASIC. For approximately , one could build up a reasonably equipped machine that could support between 16 and 32 users running BASIC programs. While expensive, it was still a fraction of the cost of the mainframe machines and, for heavy users, less than the timesharing services. HP followed this with the HP 9830, a desktop-sized machine for that also ran BASIC, which Wozniak had access to.

In January 1975 the Altair 8800 was announced and sparked off the microcomputer revolution. In March, Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club and began formulating the design of his own computer. One of the most important pieces of software for the Altair, and one of the most heavily pirated, was Altair BASIC from the recently formed Microsoft. Wozniak concluded that his machine would have to have a BASIC of its own, which would, hopefully, be the first for the MOS Technology 6502 processor. As the language needed 4 KB RAM, he made that the minimum memory for the design.

Wozniak&#x27;s references for BASIC were a copy of &quot;101 BASIC Computer Games&quot; and an HP BASIC manual. He did not know that HP&#x27;s BASIC was very different from the DEC BASIC variety used in &quot;101 Games&quot;, which was also the basis of Microsoft BASIC for the Altair. Based on these sources, Wozniak began sketching out a syntax chart for the language. The design initially included floating-point support, but still hoping he might publish the first BASIC on the 6502 and become &quot;a star&quot;, he decided to abandon floating-point and write a separate integer math system to save a few weeks programming time.

Wozniak would later describe his language as &quot;intended primarily for games and educational uses&quot;. Referring to it throughout development as &quot;GAME BASIC&quot;, Wozniak wrote the code by hand, translating the assembler code instructions into their machine code equivalents and then uploading the result to his computer. Without any training on how to write a computer language, he used his HP calculator experience to implement a stack machine to interpret expressions. Once the basic routines were up and running, he worked on the other commands one-by-one in a modular fashion. With every visit to the Homebrew club, he demonstrated a few more features added in the last month.


In early 1976 ads for its Apple I computer, Apple Inc made the claims that &quot;our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost&quot; and &quot;yes folks, Apple BASIC is Free&quot;. This was printed shortly after Bill Gates&#x27;s infamous Open Letter to Hobbyists that suggested that people were robbing him by copying versions of Altair BASIC.

Wozniak had helped Steve Jobs, who worked for Atari, with a redesign of Breakout. At some later point, he decided to see whether one could write the game in BASIC. He added commands to read paddle controllers and over a series of quick edits had a version of the game up and running. To improve its playability, he added a speaker to make clicks when the ball hit things. While showing it to Jobs, Wozniak demonstrated that he could quickly change the colors that his game used, just by altering the source code. Wozniak later wrote that he had proved that &quot;software was much more flexible than hardware&quot;, and that he and Jobs realized that &quot;now, anyone could create arcade games without having to design it in hardware.&quot;

Wozniak did complete a floating-point library for the 6502 and published it in the August 1976 edition of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;. This library was later made part of the ROMs for the Apple II. Wozniak began work on back-porting the floating-point code into Apple BASIC, but got sidetracked in the task of designing a floppy disk controller for what became the Disk II. Mike Markkula said the company would go to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas if the disk system was ready in time, so Wozniak and Randy Wigginton worked on it non-stop through the 1977 holidays.

When he returned to the topic of floating-point in BASIC, Jobs complained it was taking too long. Without Wozniak being aware, the company had already arranged a license with Microsoft to receive their recently completed 6502 version of the Altair code. Examining the MS code, Wozniak decided that it was easier to add graphics support to their code than add floating-point his own BASIC, as the latter required hand-patching of the original machine code while MS&#x27;s was written in assembler and more easily modified. The development of Apple&#x27;s BASIC ended in favor of what became Applesoft BASIC. Wozniak later noted, &quot;My biggest disappointment was going to the awful string functions like and instead of my own&quot;.

When the Apple II shipped in the summer of 1977, Integer BASIC was supplied in ROM, while Applesoft BASIC shipped on cassette. This changed with the introduction of the Apple II Plus in 1979, when Applesoft was put in the ROM.

==Description==
===Program editing===
Like most BASIC implementations of the era, Integer BASIC acted as both the language interpreter as well as the line editing environment. When BASIC was running, a command prompt was displayed where the user could enter statements. Unlike later home computer platforms, BASIC was not the default environment when the Apple II started, it normally started in the monitor. BASIC was started by pressing .

Statements that were entered with leading numbers are entered into the program storage for &quot;deferred execution&quot;, either as new lines or replacing any that might have had the same number previously. Statements that were entered without a line number were referred to as commands, and ran immediately. Line numbers could be from 0 to 32767, and lines could contain up to 128 characters.

Integer BASIC also included the command to automatically enter line numbers at a given starting number like , adding 10 to the last number with every new line. would begin numbering at line 300 by fives; 300, 305, etc. Automatic numbering was turned off by entering .

One interesting feature of the editor was that a section of the screen could be set aside as the &quot;window&quot;, where live updates took place. This was normally the entire screen, but it could be limited to a smaller area by ing values into memory locations 32 through 35. This feature could be used to create an editable text area while the rest of the screen was in graphics mode.

===Debugging===
As in most BASICs, programs were started with the command, and as was common, could be directed at a particular line number like . Execution could be stopped at any time using and then restarted with tinue, as opposed to the more typical .

For step-by-step execution, the instruction could be used at the command prompt or placed within the program itself. When it was turned on, line numbers were printed out for each line the program visited. The feature could be turned off again with .

A somewhat unusual feature was the (for &quot;display&quot;) command. When encountered in a program, from that point on any &quot;changes&quot; to a variable&#x27;s value would be displayed. For instance, would display the value of X every time it changed, along with the line number where the change occurred. As with TRACE, DSP was turned off with .

===Variable names===
Where Dartmouth BASIC and HP-BASIC limited variable names to at most two characters (either a single letter or a letter followed by one digit), and where MS-BASIC allowed a letter followed by an optional letter or digit (ignoring subsequent characters), Integer BASIC was unusual in supporting any length variable name (e.g., SUM, GAMEPOINTS, PLAYER2). The only caveat was that variable names could not contain reserved words; for example, THISCOLOR and COLORFUL were invalid variable names because they contained the keyword , a system command. Additionally, lines were limited to 128 characters, so variable names could not exceed that length.

===Mathematics===
Integer BASIC, as its name implies, uses integers as the basis for its math package. These were stored internally as a 16-bit number, little-endian (as is the 6502). This allowed a maximum value for any calculation between -32767 and 32767; although the format could also store the value -32768, BASIC could not display that number. Calculations that resulted in values outside that range produced a .

Infix operators included (addition), (subtraction), (multiplication), (division), MOD (remainder) and exponent using the character. Binary operators included , and . Binary comparisons included the standard set of , , , , , and the HP-inspired , which was equivalent to &lt;&gt;.

Only single-dimension arrays were allowed, limited in size only by the available memory. Mathematical functions were sparse; only (absolute value), (sign) and (random number) were supported. In contrast to MS-derived versions, where the parameter was ignored and always returned a value 0..&lt;1, Integer BASIC used the parameter; returned an integer from 0 to 5.

===Strings===
Integer BASIC&#x27;s string handling was based on the system in HP BASIC. This treated string variables as arrays of characters which had to be ed prior to use. This is similar to the model in C or Fortran 77. This is in contrast to MS-like BASICs where strings are an intrinsic variable-length type. Before MS-derived BASICs became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, this style was not uncommon; North Star BASIC and Atari BASIC used the same concept, as did others.
Strings in Integer Basic used a fixed amount of memory regardless of the number of characters used within them, up to a maximum of 255 characters. This had the advantage of avoiding the need for the garbage collection of the heap that was notoriously slow in MS BASIC but meant that strings that were shorter than the declared length was wasted.

Substring access was provided through array slicing syntax. For instance, printed the first six characters of , characters 0 through 5. Concatenation was provided using the same system, replaced any characters starting at position 5 with the string &quot;ABC&quot;. This contrasts with the DEC/MS-style string handling which uses string functions like to access substrings and for concatenation.

As many of the features that would be provided by string functions were instead provided by array slicing, the selection of string functions was reduced. returned the length of a string and returned the ASCII numeric code for the first letter in a string. It lacked an equivalent of the that returned the ASCII character with a given numeric code.

===Graphics and sound===
When launched, the only game controller for the Apple was the paddle controller, which had two controllers on a single connector. The position of the controller could be read using the function, passing in the controller number, 0 or 1, like , returning a value between 0 and 255.

The Apple machines did not include dedicated sound hardware, only a simple &quot;beeper&quot;. Producing sounds was accomplished by ing the memory-mapped location of the speaker, -16336. Repeatedly PEEKing that value produced tones, and the manual suggested using a mathematical expression to do this, like .

Support for graphics was more detailed. Graphics mode was turned on with the statement and off with . Drawing was modal and normally started by issuing a command to change the color, which was accomplished by setting a pseudo-variable; would set the drawing color to 12, light green. One could then to produce a single spot of that color, to draw a horizontal line at row 20 that spanned the screen, or to draw a shorter vertical line down column 7. returned the color of the screen at X,Y.

===Input/output===
Integer BASIC lacked any custom input/output commands, and also lacked the statement and the associated . To get data into and out of a program, the input/output functionality was redirected to a selected card slot with the and , which redirected output or input (respectively) to the numbered slot. From then on, data could be sent to the card using conventional commands and read from it using .

===Other notes===
Integer BASIC included a feature, which positioned the cursor on a given column from 0 to 39. It differed from the versions found in most BASICs in that it was a command with a following number, as opposed to a function with the value in parentheses; one would move the cursor to column 10 using in Integer BASIC whereas in MS this would be . Additionally, the command worked similar to but added vertical spaces instead of horizontal. For unexplained reasons, in this case the coordinates were from 1 to 24 rather than 0 to 23.

Integer BASIC included a command to exit from loops. This popped the topmost item off the FOR stack. Atari BASIC also supported the same command, while North Star BASIC used .

The Integer BASIC ROMs also included a machine code monitor, &quot;mini-assembler&quot;, and disassembler to create and debug assembly language programs. Wozniak hand-assembled the monitor as the Apple II&#x27;s first program, then used it to write Integer BASIC.

==Implementation==
Integer BASIC read the lines typed in by the user from a buffer and ran them through a parser which output a series of tokens. As part of this process, simple syntax errors were detected and listed. If the parsing was successful, the line number (if present) was converted from ASCII decimal format into a 16-bit integer and any keywords into a 7-bit integer token.

Some keywords were represented by multiple tokens; for instance, where Microsoft BASIC had one token for the keyword , Integer BASIC had three tokens: one if the keyword was followed by no arguments, one if followed by an arithmetic expression, and one if followed by a string literal.

Numeric literals, like the value 500, were converted into their 16-bit (two-byte) binary representation, in this case, hexadecimal. To indicate this was a value and not a keyword, a single byte between and was inserted in front of the two-byte value. String literals, like &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; were instead converted by setting the high bit of each character so that was stored as . Variable names were converted in the same fashion, with the letters converted to have their high-bit turned on, and any digits in the name represented by the corresponding through , so that the variable would be tokenized as .

If the line was entered without a line number, the code was then executed directly from the buffer. If it had a line number, it was copied from the buffer into the program storage area.

The runtime interpreter used two stacks for execution: one for statement keywords and the other for evaluating the parameters. Each statement was given two priorities: one that stated where it should occur in a multi-step operation, like a string of mathematical operations to provide order of operations, and another that suggested when evaluation should occur, for instance, calculating internal values of a parentheses formula. When variables were encountered, their name was parsed and then looked up in the variable storage area. If it was not found, it was added to the end of the list. The address of the variable&#x27;s storage, perhaps freshly created, was then placed on the evaluation stack.

==ROM details==
===SWEET16===

In addition to Integer BASIC, the Apple ROMs contained a custom assembler language known as SWEET16. SWEET16 is based on bytecodes that run within a simple 16-bit virtual machine. This model was used so memory could be addressed via indirect 16-bit pointers and 16-bit math functions calculated without the need to translate those to the underlying multi-instruction 8-bit 6502 code. The entire virtual machine was written in only 300 bytes. Code can call SWEET16 by issuing a subroutine call, and then return to normal 6502 code when the 16-bit operations are complete.

SWEET16 was not used by the core BASIC code, but was later used to implement several utilities. Notable among these was the line renumbering routine, which was included in the Programmer&#x27;s Aid #1 ROM, added to later Apple II models and available for user installation on earlier examples.

===Floating point===
Although Integer BASIC contained its own math routines, the Apple II ROMs also included a complete floating-point library located in ROM memory between and . The source code was included in the Apple II manual. BASIC programs requiring floating-point calculations could codice_1 into these routines.

==Performance==
Because Integer BASIC processed more of the original source code into tokens, the runtime was faster than versions that required additional runtime parsing. For comparison, Tiny BASIC tokenized only the line number, while MS BASICs tokenized only the keywords. So for instance, while Integer BASIC would convert the line entirely into tokens that could be immediately read and performed, in MS BASIC only the line number and GOTO would be tokenized, the &quot;200&quot; was left in its original ASCII format and had to be re-parsed into a 16-bit integer every time the line was encountered.

Additionally, working solely with integer math provides another major boost in speed. This is due both to the smaller 16-bit format requiring fewer memory accesses, as well as removing the need to move the floating-point decimal after calculations. As many computer benchmarks of the era were small and often performed simple math that did not require floating-point, Integer BASIC trounced most other BASICs.

On one of the earliest known microcomputer benchmarks, the Rugg/Feldman benchmarks, Integer BASIC was well over twice as fast as Applesoft BASIC on the same machine. In the Byte Sieve, where math was less important but array access and looping performance dominated, Integer BASIC took 166 seconds while Applesoft took 200. A review of Galfo Systems&#x27; Integer BASIC Compiler found that it produced code that is about 1.5 to eight times faster than compiled Applesoft BASIC, ten times faster than interpreted Integer BASIC, and 15 times faster than interpreted Applesoft. Integer BASIC did not appear in the Creative Computing Benchmark, which was first published in 1983, by which time the language was no longer included with Apple computers.

The following test series, taken from both of the original Rugg/Feldman articles, show Integer&#x27;s performance relative to the MS-derived BASIC on the same platform.

Here is a summary of what each test did:
*Test 1: for/next loop to 1000.
*Test 2: loop with compare to 1000.
*Test 3: same as 2 with added multiplication, division, addition subtraction by same variable.
*Test 4: same as 3 with added multiplication, division, addition subtraction by constants.
*Test 5: same as 4 with added subroutine call.
*Test 6; same as 5 with added inner loop.
*Test 7: same as 6 with added table population.

==Sample code==
The following is a version of Breakout written in the 1977 version of Integer BASIC for the Apple II, which was listed in the Apple II Mini Manual. There are a number of known bugs in this version.

The program starts by setting the display to and then to clear the screen. Lines 20 through 27, and the associated subroutines at line 100 and 200, are the color selection code Wozniak demonstrated for Jobs. Line 30 sets up the text window with and then uses a series of and statements to draw the playfield and the score display in the text window. The entire main loop runs from line 40 through 90 with associated subroutines. Another large amount of code near the end of the program is concerned with printing the final score. Other notes of interest include the (not-equal) comparisons on line 20, the production of a high-pitch sound using a string of s on line 65 compared to a lower-pitched tone using a loop on line 70, and the mix of graphics and text on a single display.

<text>Leipziger Land is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Delitzsch, the district-free city Leipzig, Muldentalkreis, Mittweida, the district Altenburger Land in Thuringia, and the districts Burgenlandkreis, Saalekreis in Saxony-Anhalt.

== History ==

The history of the region is influenced by the city of Leipzig. See there for more information.

The district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of , and . In 1999, the towns of Schkeuditz and Taucha were reassigned to the Delitzsch district. In August 2008, it became a part of the new district of Leipzig.

== Geography ==
The main river of the district is the White Elster, which also flows through the city of Leipzig itself. The area south of Leipzig is a big lignite day mining area, which will be recultivated as a lakeland in the near future. The lignite also made the area the main industrial area of East Germany.

<doc id="310950" wikidata="Q1365548" url="?curid=310950" title="Principal bundle">
<text>In mathematics, a principal bundle is a mathematical object that formalizes some of the essential features of the Cartesian product formula_1 of a space formula_2 with a group formula_3. In the same way as with the Cartesian product, a principal bundle formula_4 is equipped with
# An action of formula_3 on formula_4, analogous to formula_7 for a product space (where formula_8 is an element of formula_4 and formula_10 is the group element from formula_3; the group action is conventionally a right action).
# A projection onto formula_2. For a product space, this is just the projection onto the first factor, formula_13.
Unless it is the product space formula_1, a principal bundle lacks a preferred choice of identity cross-section; it has no preferred analog of formula_15. Likewise, there is not generally a projection onto formula_3 generalizing the projection onto the second factor, formula_17 that exists for the Cartesian product. They may also have a complicated topology that prevents them from being realized as a product space even if a number of arbitrary choices are made to try to define such a structure by defining it on smaller pieces of the space.

A common example of a principal bundle is the frame bundle formula_18 of a vector bundle formula_19, which consists of all ordered bases of the vector space attached to each point. The group formula_20 in this case, is the general linear group, which acts on the right in the usual way: by changes of basis. Since there is no natural way to choose an ordered basis of a vector space, a frame bundle lacks a canonical choice of identity cross-section.

Principal bundles have important applications in topology and differential geometry and mathematical gauge theory. They have also found application in physics where they form part of the foundational framework of physical gauge theories. 

==Formal definition==

A principal formula_3-bundle, where formula_3 denotes any topological group, is a fiber bundle formula_23 together with a continuous right action formula_24 such that formula_3 preserves the fibers of formula_4 (i.e. if formula_27 then formula_28 for all formula_29) and acts freely and transitively (meaning each fiber is a G-torsor) on them in such a way that for each formula_30 and formula_27, the map formula_32 sending formula_33 to formula_34 is a homeomorphism. In particular each fiber of the bundle is homeomorphic to the group formula_3 itself. Frequently, one requires the base space formula_2 to be Hausdorff and possibly paracompact.

Since the group action preserves the fibers of formula_23 and acts transitively, it follows that the orbits of the formula_3-action are precisely these fibers and the orbit space formula_39 is homeomorphic to the base space formula_2. Because the action is free and transitive, the fibers have the structure of G-torsors. A formula_3-torsor is a space that is homeomorphic to formula_3 but lacks a group structure since there is no preferred choice of an identity element.

An equivalent definition of a principal formula_3-bundle is as a formula_3-bundle formula_23 with fiber formula_3 where the structure group acts on the fiber by left multiplication. Since right multiplication by formula_3 on the fiber commutes with the action of the structure group, there exists an invariant notion of right multiplication by formula_3 on formula_4. The fibers of formula_50 then become right formula_3-torsors for this action.

The definitions above are for arbitrary topological spaces. One can also define principal formula_3-bundles in the category of smooth manifolds. Here formula_23 is required to be a smooth map between smooth manifolds, formula_3 is required to be a Lie group, and the corresponding action on formula_4 should be smooth.

==Examples==

=== Trivial bundle and sections ===
Over an open ball formula_56, or formula_57, with induced coordinates formula_58, any principal formula_3-bundle is isomorphic to a trivial bundleformula_60and a smooth section formula_61 is equivalently given by a (smooth) function formula_62 sinceformula_63for some smooth function. For example, if formula_64, the Lie group of formula_65 unitary matrices, then a section can be constructed by considering four real-valued functionsformula_66and applying them to the parameterization

formula_67This same procedure valids by taking a parameterization of a collection of matrices defining a Lie group formula_3 and by considering the set of functions from a patch of the base space formula_69 to formula_70 and inserting them into the parameterization.

=== Other examples ===

* The prototypical example of a smooth principal bundle is the frame bundle of a smooth manifold formula_71, often denoted formula_72 or formula_73. Here the fiber over a point formula_74 is the set of all frames (i.e. ordered bases) for the tangent space formula_75. The general linear group formula_76 acts freely and transitively on these frames. These fibers can be glued together in a natural way so as to obtain a principal formula_76-bundle over formula_71.
* Variations on the above example include the orthonormal frame bundle of a Riemannian manifold. Here the frames are required to be orthonormal with respect to the metric. The structure group is the orthogonal group formula_79. The example also works for bundles other than the tangent bundle; if formula_19 is any vector bundle of rank formula_81 over formula_71, then the bundle of frames of formula_19 is a principal formula_84-bundle, sometimes denoted formula_18.
* A normal (regular) covering space formula_86 is a principal bundle where the structure group
: formula_87
: acts on the fibres of formula_88 via the monodromy action. In particular, the universal cover of formula_2 is a principal bundle over formula_2 with structure group formula_91 (since the universal cover is simply connected and thus formula_92 is trivial).
* Let formula_3 be a Lie group and let formula_94 be a closed subgroup (not necessarily normal). Then formula_3 is a principal formula_94-bundle over the (left) coset space formula_97. Here the action of formula_94 on formula_3 is just right multiplication. The fibers are the left cosets of formula_94 (in this case there is a distinguished fiber, the one containing the identity, which is naturally isomorphic to formula_94).
* Consider the projection formula_102 given by formula_103. This principal formula_104-bundle is the associated bundle of the Möbius strip. Besides the trivial bundle, this is the only principal formula_104-bundle over formula_106.
* Projective spaces provide some more interesting examples of principal bundles. Recall that the formula_107-sphere formula_108 is a two-fold covering space of real projective space formula_109. The natural action of formula_110 on formula_108 gives it the structure of a principal formula_110-bundle over formula_109. Likewise, formula_114 is a principal formula_115-bundle over complex projective space formula_116 and formula_117 is a principal formula_118-bundle over quaternionic projective space formula_119. We then have a series of principal bundles for each positive formula_107:
: formula_121
: formula_122
: formula_123
: Here formula_124 denotes the unit sphere in formula_125 (equipped with the Euclidean metric). For all of these examples the formula_126 cases give the so-called Hopf bundles.

==Basic properties==

===Trivializations and cross sections===

One of the most important questions regarding any fiber bundle is whether or not it is trivial, &quot;i.e.&quot; isomorphic to a product bundle. For principal bundles there is a convenient characterization of triviality:

:Proposition. &quot;A principal bundle is trivial if and only if it admits a global section.&quot;

The same is not true in general for other fiber bundles. For instance, vector bundles always have a zero section whether they are trivial or not and sphere bundles may admit many global sections without being trivial.

The same fact applies to local trivializations of principal bundles. Let be a principal -bundle. An open set in admits a local trivialization if and only if there exists a local section on . Given a local trivialization

:formula_127
one can define an associated local section 
:formula_128
where is the identity in . Conversely, given a section one defines a trivialization by
:formula_129
The simple transitivity of the action on the fibers of guarantees that this map is a bijection, it is also a homeomorphism. The local trivializations defined by local sections are -equivariant in the following sense. If we write
:formula_127
in the form 
:formula_131
then the map
:formula_132
satisfies
:formula_133
Equivariant trivializations therefore preserve the -torsor structure of the fibers. In terms of the associated local section the map is given by
:formula_134
The local version of the cross section theorem then states that the equivariant local trivializations of a principal bundle are in one-to-one correspondence with local sections.

Given an equivariant local trivialization of , we have local sections on each . On overlaps these must be related by the action of the structure group . In fact, the relationship is provided by the transition functions
:formula_135
By gluing the local trivializations together using these transition functions, one may reconstruct the original principal bundle. This is an example of the fiber bundle construction theorem.
For any we have
:formula_136

===Characterization of smooth principal bundles===

If formula_137 is a smooth principal formula_3-bundle then formula_3 acts freely and properly on formula_4 so that the orbit space formula_39 is diffeomorphic to the base space formula_2. It turns out that these properties completely characterize smooth principal bundles. That is, if formula_4 is a smooth manifold, formula_3 a Lie group and formula_145 a smooth, free, and proper right action then
*formula_39 is a smooth manifold,
*the natural projection formula_147 is a smooth submersion, and
*formula_4 is a smooth principal formula_3-bundle over formula_39.

==Use of the notion==

===Reduction of the structure group===

Given a subgroup H of G one may consider the bundle formula_151 whose fibers are homeomorphic to the coset space formula_97. If the new bundle admits a global section, then one says that the section is a reduction of the structure group from formula_3 to formula_94 . The reason for this name is that the (fiberwise) inverse image of the values of this section form a subbundle of formula_4 that is a principal formula_94-bundle. If formula_94 is the identity, then a section of formula_4 itself is a reduction of the structure group to the identity. Reductions of the structure group do not in general exist.

Many topological questions about the structure of a manifold or the structure of bundles over it that are associated to a principal formula_3-bundle may be rephrased as questions about the admissibility of the reduction of the structure group (from formula_3 to formula_94). For example:

* A formula_162-dimensional real manifold admits an almost-complex structure if the frame bundle on the manifold, whose fibers are formula_163, can be reduced to the group formula_164.
* An formula_107-dimensional real manifold admits a formula_81-plane field if the frame bundle can be reduced to the structure group formula_167.
* A manifold is orientable if and only if its frame bundle can be reduced to the special orthogonal group, formula_168.
* A manifold has spin structure if and only if its frame bundle can be further reduced from formula_169 to formula_170 the Spin group, which maps to formula_169 as a double cover.

Also note: an formula_107-dimensional manifold admits formula_107 vector fields that are linearly independent at each point if and only if its frame bundle admits a global section. In this case, the manifold is called parallelizable.

===Associated vector bundles and frames===

If formula_4 is a principal formula_3-bundle and formula_125 is a linear representation of formula_3, then one can construct a vector bundle formula_178 with fibre formula_125, as the quotient of the product formula_4×formula_125 by the diagonal action of formula_3. This is a special case of the associated bundle construction, and formula_19 is called an associated vector bundle to formula_4. If the representation of formula_3 on formula_125 is faithful, so that formula_3 is a subgroup of the general linear group GL(formula_125), then formula_19 is a formula_3-bundle and formula_4 provides a reduction of structure group of the frame bundle of formula_19 from formula_193 to formula_3. This is the sense in which principal bundles provide an abstract formulation of the theory of frame bundles.

==Classification of principal bundles==
Any topological group admits a classifying space : the quotient by the action of of some weakly contractible space, &quot;e.g.&quot;, a topological space with vanishing homotopy groups. The classifying space has the property that any principal bundle over a paracompact manifold &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle . In fact, more is true, as the set of isomorphism classes of principal bundles over the base identifies with the set of homotopy classes of maps .

<text>In mathematics, a quotient algebra is the result of partitioning the elements of an algebraic structure using a congruence relation.
Quotient algebras are also called factor algebras. Here, the congruence relation must be an equivalence relation that is additionally &quot;compatible&quot; with all the operations of the algebra, in the formal sense described below.
Its equivalence classes partition the elements of the given algebraic structure. The quotient algebra has these classes as its elements, and the compatibility conditions are used to give the classes an algebraic structure.

The idea of the quotient algebra abstracts into one common notion the quotient structure of quotient rings of ring theory, quotient groups of group theory, the quotient spaces of linear algebra and the quotient modules of representation theory into a common framework.

== Compatible relation ==
Let &quot;A&quot; be the set of the elements of an algebra formula_1, and let &quot;E&quot; be an equivalence relation on the set &quot;A&quot;. The relation &quot;E&quot; is said to be &quot;compatible&quot; with (or have the &quot;substitution property&quot; with respect to) an &quot;n&quot;-ary operation &quot;f&quot;, if formula_2 for formula_3 implies formula_4 for any formula_5 with formula_3. An equivalence relation compatible with all the operations of an algebra is called a congruence with respect to this algebra.

== Quotient algebras and homomorphisms ==
Any equivalence relation &quot;E&quot; in a set &quot;A&quot; partitions this set in equivalence classes. The set of these equivalence classes is usually called the quotient set, and denoted &quot;A&quot;/&quot;E&quot;. For an algebra formula_1, it is straightforward to define the operations induced on the elements of &quot;A&quot;/&quot;E&quot; if &quot;E&quot; is a congruence. Specifically, for any operation formula_8 of arity formula_9 in formula_1 (where the superscript simply denotes that it is an operation in formula_1, and the subscript formula_12 enumerates the functions in formula_1 and their arities) define formula_14 as formula_15, where formula_16 denotes the equivalence class of formula_17 generated by &quot;E&quot; (&quot;&quot;x&quot; modulo &quot;E&quot;&quot;).

For an algebra formula_18, given a congruence &quot;E&quot; on formula_1, the algebra formula_20 is called the &quot;quotient algebra&quot; (or &quot;factor algebra&quot;) of formula_1 modulo &quot;E&quot;. There is a natural homomorphism from formula_1 to formula_23 mapping every element to its equivalence class. In fact, every homomorphism &quot;h&quot; determines a congruence relation via the kernel of the homomorphism, formula_24.

Given an algebra formula_1, a homomorphism &quot;h&quot; thus defines two algebras homomorphic to formula_1, the image h(formula_1) and formula_28 The two are isomorphic, a result known as the &quot;homomorphic image theorem&quot; or as the first isomorphism theorem for universal algebra. Formally, let formula_29 be a surjective homomorphism. Then, there exists a unique isomorphism &quot;g&quot; from formula_28 onto formula_31 such that &quot;g&quot; composed with the natural homomorphism induced by formula_32 equals &quot;h&quot;.

== Congruence lattice ==
For every algebra formula_1 on the set &quot;A&quot;, the identity relation on A, and formula_34 are trivial congruences. An algebra with no other congruences is called &quot;simple&quot;.

Let formula_35 be the set of congruences on the algebra formula_1. Because congruences are closed under intersection, we can define a meet operation: formula_37 by simply taking the intersection of the congruences formula_38.

On the other hand, congruences are not closed under union. However, we can define the closure of any binary relation &quot;E&quot;, with respect to a fixed algebra formula_1, such that it is a congruence, in the following way: formula_40. Note that the closure of a binary relation is a congruence and thus depends on the operations in formula_1, not just on the carrier set. Now define formula_42 as formula_43.

For every algebra formula_1, formula_45 with the two operations defined above forms a lattice, called the &quot;congruence lattice&quot; of formula_1.

== Maltsev conditions ==
If two congruences &quot;permute&quot; (commute) with the composition of relations as operation, i.e. formula_47, then their join (in the congruence lattice) is equal to their composition: formula_48. An algebra is called &quot;congruence permutable&quot; if every pair of its congruences permutes; likewise a variety is said to be congruence-permutable if all its members are 
congruence-permutable algebras.

In 1954, Anatoly Maltsev established the following characterization of congruence-permutable varieties: a variety is congruence permutable if and only if there exist a ternary term such that ; this is called a Maltsev term and varieties with this property are called Maltsev varieties. Maltsev&#x27;s characterization explains a large number of similar results in groups (take ), rings, quasigroups (take , complemented lattices, Heyting algebras etc. Furthermore, every congruence-permutable algebra is congruence-modular, i.e. its lattice of congruences is modular lattice as well; the converse is not true however.

After Maltsev&#x27;s result, other researchers found characterizations based on conditions similar to that found by Maltsev but for other kinds of properties. In 1967 Bjarni Jónsson found the conditions for varieties having congruence lattices that are distributive (thus called congruence-distributive varieties), while in 1969 Alan Day did the same for varieties having congruence lattices that are modular. Generically, such conditions are called Maltsev conditions.

This line of research led to the Pixley–Wille algorithm for generating Maltsev conditions associated
with congruence identities.

<text>Soong Ai-ling (; July 15, 1889 – October 20, 1973), legally Soong E-ling or Eling Soong, Christian name Nancy, was a Chinese businesswoman, the eldest of the Soong sisters and the wife of H. H. Kung (Kung Hsiang-Hsi), who was the richest man in the early 20th century Republic of China. 

==Life==
Born in Shanghai, she attended McTyeire School beginning at age 5. Soong Ai-ling arrived in the United States at the Port of San Francisco, California on June 30, 1904, aboard the &quot;SS Korea&quot; at the age of 14. She attended Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia. Soong returned to China in 1909 after her graduation. In late 1911, she worked as a secretary for Sun Yat-sen, a job later taken by her sister, Soong Ching-ling, who later became Madame Sun Yat-sen.

Soong Ai-ling met her future husband, Kung Hsiang Hsi, in 1913, and they married the following year in Yokohama. After marrying, Soong taught English for a while and engaged in child welfare work.

In 1936, she founded the Sandai Company (also called Sanbu Company) and became a successful and immensely rich businesswoman in her own right. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, she was active in the Committee of the National Friends of the Wounded Soldiers and the National Refugee Children&#x27;s Association, and chair of the local Hong Kong section of the Committee of the National Friends of the Wounded Soldiers.

The three Soong sisters made public appearances in Hong Kong in favor of relief work until 1940, when the Japanese radio stated that they would evacuate rather than join the Chinese government in Chongqing to endure the war conditions. In response to this, they left for Chongqing, where they continued to appear to boost public morale touring hospitals, air-raid shelter systems and bomb sites during the war. They founded the Indusco (also called Gungho) organization to protect Chinese industry during wartime conditions, an organization in which Soong Ai-ling was most active of the sisters.

During the later years of the war, Soong Ai-ling, her husband, and her children were accused of graft, corruption, black-marketing and war profiteering. In 1944, her husband was finally asked to step down as minister of finance. She and her husband transferred their immense wealth and business abroad and left for the US.

She died at age 84 on October 20, 1973 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. She is interred in a mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery in Westchester County, New York.

<text>Macroom (; ) is a market town in County Cork, Ireland, located in the valley of the River Sullane, halfway between Cork city and Killarney. Its population has grown and receded over the centuries as it went through periods of war, famine and workhouses, forced emigration and intermittent prosperity. The 2011 census gave an urban population of 3,879 people, while the 2016 census recorded 3,765 people. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.
Macroom began as a meeting place for the druids of Munster. It is first mentioned is in 6th-century records, and the immediate area hosted a major battle involving the Irish king Brian Boru. During the Middle Ages, the town was invaded by a succession of warring clans, including the Murcheatach Uí Briain and Richard de Cogan families. In the early modern period the MacCarthys took control and later the area found prosperity via milling. The MacCarthys built a series of tower houses, some of which survive. The family lost influence during the Williamite wars of the 1690s, after which authority over the town castle waxed and waned between the MacCarthys and a number of Anglo-Irish families.

The population fell in the 1840s during the Great Famine. Evidence can be found in the former workhouse, now the district hospital at the north side of New Street, and the mass graveyard to the west, near Clondrohid. During the late 18th and early 19th century, a number of Anglo-Irish families, and a branch of the Massey family, settled in the area. Many of their estate houses were burned in the period around the Irish War of Independence as the town was caught up in the turmoil of IRA activity.

Today the town is an economic hub for the mid-Cork region, and the location of a Danone milk processing factory, which dries and cans infant formula from milk supplied by local dairy farmers. Until the 1950s, New Street was the town&#x27;s economic hub, and contained many small retail outlets.

==Name==
Macroom&#x27;s Irish language name, , likely translates as &#x27;crooked plain&#x27; in reference to the bend in the River Sullane on which its historic core is situated. It has also been suggested that it may translate as &quot;meeting place of followers of the god Crom&quot; or &quot;crooked oak&quot;, the latter a reference to a large oak tree that apparently grew in the town-square during the reign of King John.

==History==

===Neolithic===
Evidence of pre-history human activity in the Macroom area survives in the many Iron Age burial monuments; the area is unusually rich with standing stones, dolmens and stone circles. Later, in the early Dark Ages, Macroom seems to have been a centre for Bardic conventions and a base for the Druids of Munster. The first historical reference to Macroom dates from the 6th century, when the townland was known as Achad Dorbchon and held within the kingdom of Muscraighe Mitine.

The Eóganachta were then the dominant clan of Munster and held kingdoms from Muscraighe Mitine to the midlands town of Birr. At some point, they were replaced by the Uí Floinn, who commissioned a castle in Macroom so as to establish Raithleann as capital of Muskerry.

===Middle ages===
Muscraighe Mitine underwent three invasions during the 13th century. The Murcheatach Uí Briain and Richard de Cogan arrived in 1201 and 1207 respectively; the MacCarthys became the dominant and most powerful family and held Macroom Castle until the mid-17th century. 
From the 14th century, Macroom became the capital of the Barony of Muskerry and the centre for trade, burial and religious worship. It was one of the earliest Irish milling centres, and from the end of the 16th century the town grew from a village to a functionally diverse urban centre. The locality grew outwards from the castle. The MacCarthys established the town as a centre for markets and fairs, and in 1620 a market house was built to the east of and facing the castle. The family introduced a plantation scheme which aimed to attract new agriculture and industrial techniques and methods to the area.

===Modern period===
By the mid-17th century, Anglo-Irish families owned approximately one-third of the town in value terms. The Protestant families introduced butter making, a labour-intensive industry. A 1750 tenement list details 134 buildings and 300 families, with a population ratio of 6 to 1 between Catholic and Protestants. The town had developed from a locality of mud cabins in the early 1660s to a linear shaped urban settlement of mainly thatched cabins, which were later replaced by solid cottages following a campaign by the Irish Land and Labour Association (ILLA). Macroom Castle was for a period owned by Admiral Sir William Penn, a Royal Navy officer and father of William Penn, after whom the U.S. state of Pennsylvania is named.

====Battle of Macroom====
The 1650 Battle of Macroom was waged as part of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, when English Parliamentarian forces led by Roger Boyle defeated an Irish Confederate force under David Roche. Bishop Boetius MacEgan, acting on behalf of the MacCarthys, failed to hold the castle. He was taken prisoner by Parliamentarian forces and executed by hanging at Carrigadrohid.

====Irish War of Independence====
Macroom was the main base in Cork for the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence. The Irish Republican Army (IRA) was highly active in the county, especially in the areas around Macroom, Bandon and Dunmanway. RIC policemen in the town described the area as &quot;practically in a state of war&quot;. After a series of burnings of local RIC barracks and courthouses a curfew was imposed on the town, with a ban on public meetings and market fairs. A local IRA volunteers wrote of a &quot;hinterland unpoliced and unwatched&quot;. Local RIC policemen felt they had lost control and the Auxiliaries were called to reinforce them. The townspeople of Macroom treated the Auxiliaries with hostility, and there were instances of their patrols being stoned. The British were embroiled in a guerrilla battle in the Muskerry hills, coming under fire from the Ballyvourney IRA cell, and lost three men – two of them officers – in one attack.

On 28 November 1920 at Kilmichael, on the road between Macroom and Dunmanway, a convoy consisting of 18 Auxiliaries in two lorries were ambushed by IRA volunteers from the 3rd Cork Brigade under the command of Tom Barry. 16 Auxiliaries were killed and 1 wounded, while the IRA suffered no casualties. After the ambush, the Auxiliaries increased their mistreatment of the County Cork populace, and martial law was declared in the counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick and Tipperary, which led Macroom to fall under martial law for a period of time. Macroom Castle was burned out on five separate occasions; the last occasion was on 18 August 1922, following the evacuation of the Auxiliaries from the town. Volunteers from the anti-treaty IRA retreated from Cork City to Macroom, burning the castle before leaving during the Irish Civil War.

Mount Massey, which is now ruined, was the 18th and 19th century home of the members of the Massey family, and is located north by Kilnagurteen and gave the townland of Masseytown its name. The family were major landowners with land covering 13,363 acres, extending from Clondrohid to Drishane. During the 19th century, the family tried to temper growing Irish nationalist sentiment by sponsoring the local town fair. Later their home and estate was besieged and burnt in December 1920 by IRA volunteers during the Irish War of Independence.

IRA volunteer and politician Michael Collins was killed in 1922 in an ambush at nearby Béal na Bláth. Lady Olivia Ardilaun, a descendant of the MacCarthys, and widow of Lord Ardilaun, sold the castle demesne in 1924 to a group of local businessmen, which they put in trust for the town.

==Geography and climate==
Macroom was built on the River Sullane, a tributary of the River Lee. Its hinterland lies on a valley at the foot of the Boggeragh Mountains. The town stretches for about and largely consists of two long streets, Main Street and New Street, divided by the Ten Arch Bridge, which also leads off to the suburb of Massey Town, further towards the village of Ballinagree and the Boggeragh Mountains.

Like the rest of Ireland, the climate is temperate maritime, very even and heavily influenced by the North Atlantic Current, resulting in mild winters and cool summers. Weather in Macroom is mild, usually warm, temperate and humid, with significant rainfall throughout the year, averaging at 1164 mm. Rain falls on average around 21 days of each month, peaking in December (average 24 days), and falling off slightly in June (average 21 days). Snow is uncommon; it tends to fall in January or February, for an average of 2–3 days per year. Wind speeds vary from c 80 km/h average in winter, to 50–52 in summer. The mean temperature is 10.1 °C.

==Economy==

The economy is primarily agricultural, with local dairy farmers being members of the Dairygold co-operative. Their milk is dried or evaporated in Mitchelstown as skim milk or whey concentrate, and eventually supplied to the local Danone plant, which produces infant formula for a worldwide market.

===Tourism===

Tourist attractions include the town centre, an 18-hole golf course, and the Castle Grounds, with fishing and golfing grounds. The town&#x27;s surroundings contain large amounts of megalithic monuments, early Christian holy wells, churches and sacred sites associated with ancient visionaries and healers. Mushera Mountain is located a few kilometres to the north of the town, near Millstreet Country Park. It contains the ancient Saint John&#x27;s Well. 

The Castle Arch, the centerpiece of the old castle grounds, admits walkers to the demesne parklands. It is held in trust to, and in the possession of the people of Macroom. Its large park contains riverside walks among mature oak and beech trees.

====The Gearagh====
The Gearagh is a national nature reserve on an inland delta, is located south of Macroom. It comprises a series of small islands, separated by anastomosing, mostly flat, river channels or streams, and is bounded by Toon Bridge, Illaunmore, and Anahala Bridge. The area is thought to have been wooded since the end of the last Ice Age c. 8,000 BC. The alluvial woodland extended as far as the Lee Bridge, and consisted of a large number of mature oak and ash trees.

The reserve was gutted in 1954 when the Lee hydro-electric scheme led to extensive tree-felling and flooding. Now submerged houses are visible from the area around Two Mile Bridge. The scheme resulted in the loss of sixty percent of the former oak woodland. Today, the Gearagh is of interest and importance due to its rich and rare diversity of wildlife, and represents the only extant extensive alluvial woodland in Western Europe.
The Gearagh is primarily of interest and importance due to its rich and rare diversity of wildlife, and it represents the only extant extensive alluvial woodland in Western Europe. It hosts numerous rare plant species including marsh marigold, meadowsweet and nightshade, and 62 species of moss and liverwort. While oak and ash trees once pre-dominated, today there are a number of willow and alder trees on the higher islands and inlets. It hosts a large diversity of birds and wildfowl and attracts both summer and winter migrants. Examples include mallards, wigeon, Greylag geese, herons and coots. It also hosts Atlantic salmon and the near extinct freshwater pearl mussel. The area is protected under the international Ramsar Convention.

Today the Gearagh comprises wide but shallow water enclosing a series of small islands separated by anastomosing, mostly flat, river streams. It remains an area of outstanding natural beauty, with a diverse ecological system and wide variety of plants, birds and fish, including freshwater pearl mussel, Atlantic salmon, whooper swans, kingfishers and otters.

====Carrigaphooca Castle====
Carrigaphooca Castle is a ruined five storey rectangular tower house situated on a steep-sided rock overlooking the River Sullane. It is located 6 km west of Macroom, in an area once known as Gleann na n-Dearg (&quot;Valley of the Reds&quot;). The tower dominates the landscape of Lissacresig (&quot;Fairyland&quot;) in Clondrohid, and Lower Shanballyshane, in Kilnamartyra. Carrigaphooca is made of sandstone and limestone and was built as a defensive tower by MacCarthy clan member Donal MacCarthy of Drishane c. 1336–51. Cormac Teige MacCarthy, the Lord of Blarney took refuge in the tower after he had sided with the Irish during the Siege of Kinsale in 1601. He stayed there until he was forgiven by Elizabeth I after he had written a personal letter of apology to her. In 1602, the castle was attacked and taken by Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare and another member of the extended McCarthy family. After a protracted siege, their forces broke through the outer wall and burned the timber door at the north face entrance. The defenders surrendered and were allowed to go free.

Carrigaphooca is positioned in an area rich with neolithic monuments; a stone circle lies two fields to the east. The tower is located on private property, and no longer accessible to the public, although it is owned by the state and maintained by the Office of Public Works.

==== Mountain Dew festival ====
From 1976 to 1982 Macroom hosted the annual Macroom Mountain Dew Festival, organised by young local business people. The festivals attracted up to 20,000 attendees each year, with lineups that included Rory Gallagher, Thin Lizzy and Van Morrison. It was the first of its kind for Ireland, and was intended to reinvigorate a town that was then stagnant economically. According to one of the organisers, Martin Fitzgerald, &quot;The town needed a bit of shake rattle and roll to tempt not just international investors but Irish people to rest there a bit long...a rock concert fitted the bill&quot;. Line ups included Rory Gallagher, Phil Lynott, Elvis Costello Van Morrison, Marianne Faithfull and Horslips, and was attended by John Lydon of the Sex Pistols.

==Churches==
According to the 2011 census, the urban population of 3,879 included 3,535 people identifying as Roman Catholic. The town&#x27;s Catholic church, dedicated to St. Coleman, was built in 1841. It was remodeled in 1893, based on a design by Dominic Coakley.

Macroom&#x27;s Church of Ireland building was constructed in 1823 on foot of a loan of £1000 from the Board of Fruits. The building is now derelict, although the graveyard is still in use. The remains of a thatched-chapel lies to the west of the town, on Lackaduduv mountain. A rare surviving form, the remnants are known locally as &quot;Carrignaspirroge Chapel&quot;.

==Transport==
Macroom is on the national primary route N22, approximately 38 km from Cork city and 48 km from Killarney. The nearest airport is Cork Airport.

A railway ran between the town and Cork city from 1866 to 1953, terminating in the mart grounds. By 1890 there were five services each way on week days and two on Sundays, with the running time taking just over an hour. Macroom railway station opened on 12 May 1866; it closed for passenger traffic on 1 July 1935 and for goods traffic on 10 March 1947, and was finally closed on 1 December 1953.

==Education==
The town has two primary and three secondary schools: a De La Salle secondary school for boys, the St. Mary&#x27;s Secondary School (Sisters of Mercy) for girls, and McEgan College, a mixed technical college located in the castle grounds.

The Convent of Mercy school is situated within the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s complex attached to St. Colman&#x27;s Church, and also includes a convent, primary school, graveyard and grotto.

Coláiste De La Salle was opened in 1933 and originally located in Macroom Town Hall, until a permanent building was completed three years later. By the late 1970s the school was experiencing severe capacity issues and a re-structure and extension of the school was undertaken in 1982. Since its opening the ratio of pupils has remained relatively stable with 40% coming from the town and the rest from surrounding parishes.

A new building was constructed in 2008 for St Colman&#x27;s Boys National School after years of planning applications and appeals.

<text>In mathematics, specifically category theory, a subcategory of a category &quot;C&quot; is a category &quot;S&quot; whose objects are objects in &quot;C&quot; and whose morphisms are morphisms in &quot;C&quot; with the same identities and composition of morphisms. Intuitively, a subcategory of &quot;C&quot; is a category obtained from &quot;C&quot; by &quot;removing&quot; some of its objects and arrows.

== Formal definition ==
Let &quot;C&quot; be a category. A subcategory &quot;S&quot; of &quot;C&quot; is given by
*a subcollection of objects of &quot;C&quot;, denoted ob(&quot;S&quot;),
*a subcollection of morphisms of &quot;C&quot;, denoted hom(&quot;S&quot;).
such that
*for every &quot;X&quot; in ob(&quot;S&quot;), the identity morphism id&quot;X&quot; is in hom(&quot;S&quot;),
*for every morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in hom(&quot;S&quot;), both the source &quot;X&quot; and the target &quot;Y&quot; are in ob(&quot;S&quot;),
*for every pair of morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in hom(&quot;S&quot;) the composite &quot;f&quot; o &quot;g&quot; is in hom(&quot;S&quot;) whenever it is defined.

These conditions ensure that &quot;S&quot; is a category in its own right: its collection of objects is ob(&quot;S&quot;), its collection of morphisms is hom(&quot;S&quot;), and its identities and composition are as in &quot;C&quot;. There is an obvious faithful functor &quot;I&quot; : &quot;S&quot; → &quot;C&quot;, called the inclusion functor which takes objects and morphisms to themselves.

Let &quot;S&quot; be a subcategory of a category &quot;C&quot;. We say that &quot;S&quot; is a full subcategory of &quot;C&quot; if for each pair of objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;S&quot;,
:formula_1
A full subcategory is one that includes &quot;all&quot; morphisms in &quot;C&quot; between objects of &quot;S&quot;. For any collection of objects &quot;A&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, there is a unique full subcategory of &quot;C&quot; whose objects are those in &quot;A&quot;.

== Examples ==
* The category of finite sets forms a full subcategory of the category of sets.
* The category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are bijections forms a non-full subcategory of the category of sets.
* The category of abelian groups forms a full subcategory of the category of groups.
* The category of rings (whose morphisms are unit-preserving ring homomorphisms) forms a non-full subcategory of the category of rngs.
* For a field &quot;K&quot;, the category of &quot;K&quot;-vector spaces forms a full subcategory of the category of (left or right) &quot;K&quot;-modules.

== Embeddings ==
Given a subcategory &quot;S&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, the inclusion functor &quot;I&quot; : &quot;S&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is both a faithful functor and injective on objects. It is full if and only if &quot;S&quot; is a full subcategory.

Some authors define an embedding to be a full and faithful functor. Such a functor is necessarily injective on objects up to isomorphism. For instance, the Yoneda embedding is an embedding in this sense.

Some authors define an embedding to be a full and faithful functor that is injective on objects.

Other authors define a functor to be an embedding if it is
faithful and
injective on objects.
Equivalently, &quot;F&quot; is an embedding if it is injective on morphisms. A functor &quot;F&quot; is then called a full embedding if it is a full functor and an embedding.

With the definitions of the previous paragraph, for any (full) embedding &quot;F&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;C&quot; the image of &quot;F&quot; is a (full) subcategory &quot;S&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; induces an isomorphism of categories between &quot;B&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. If &quot;F&quot; is not injective on objects then the image of &quot;F&quot; is equivalent to &quot;B&quot;.

In some categories, one can also speak of morphisms of the category being embeddings.

== Types of subcategories ==
A subcategory &quot;S&quot; of &quot;C&quot; is said to be isomorphism-closed or replete if every isomorphism &quot;k&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;Y&quot; is in &quot;S&quot; also belongs to &quot;S&quot;. An isomorphism-closed full subcategory is said to be strictly full.
A subcategory of &quot;C&quot; is wide or lluf (a term first posed by Peter Freyd) if it contains all the objects of &quot;C&quot;. A wide subcategory is typically not full: the only wide full subcategory of a category is that category itself.

A Serre subcategory is a non-empty full subcategory &quot;S&quot; of an abelian category &quot;C&quot; such that for all short exact sequences

:formula_2

in &quot;C&quot;, &quot;M&quot; belongs to &quot;S&quot; if and only if both formula_3 and formula_4 do. This notion arises from Serre&#x27;s C-theory.

It is located south of the Tatras proper, from which it is separated by the valleys of the Váh and Poprad rivers (the Liptov-Spiš abasement). The valley formed by the Hron River is situated south of the Low Tatras range. The ridge runs west-eastwards and is about 80 km long.

The Čertovica pass divides the range into two parts. The highest peaks of the Low Tatras are located in its western part. Ďumbier is the highest mountain at 2,042 m AMSL. Its neighbour Chopok (2,024 m) is accessible by a chairlift, and it is the most visited place in the Low Tatras. Other peaks in the western part include Dereše (2,004 m) and Chabenec (1,955 m). The highest peak in the eastern part is Kráľova hoľa (1,946 m). The best viewpoints in western part are Veľká Chochuľa, Salatín, Chabenec, Skalka, Chopok, Ďumbier, Siná, Poludnica and Baba.

Several karst areas are situated in limestone and dolomite strata at the southern and northern edges of the main ridge, which is composed of granite and gneiss. Among many discovered caves, Bystrianska Cave (&quot;Bystrianska jaskyňa&quot;), Cave of Dead Bats (&quot;Jaskyňa mŕtvych netopierov&quot;), Demänovská jaskyňa Slobody, Demänová Ice Cave (&quot;Demänovská ľadová jaskyňa&quot;), and Važecká Cave (&quot;Važecká jaskyňa&quot;) are open to the public. The biggest canyon is Hučiaky under Salatín in Ludrová valley near Ružomberok (7 caves - not open for public), suitable for canyoning. The highest waterfall is under Brankov near Ružomberok - Podsuchá (55 m high), reachable by green marked footpath from Podsuchá (20 min). The biggest tarn is &quot;Vrbické pleso&quot; in the &quot;Demänovská dolina&quot; Valley.

The mountains are densely forested and their rich fauna includes bear, wolf, and lynx. The alpine meadows are the habitat of chamois.

==National Park==
Most of the Low Tatras is protected by the Low Tatras National Park (&quot;Národný park Nízke Tatry&quot;; abbr. NAPANT), established in 1978. The area of the National Park is 728 km2 (281.08 mi2) and the buffer zone takes 1,102 km2 (425.48 mi2); 1,830 km2 (706.56 mi2) together.

==Tourism==
Tourism is very popular in the Tatras. During the winter there are several ski resorts in Low Tatras, for example Jasná, Mýto pod Ďumbierom, and Tále. Not only are these hubs of hiking and cross-country skiing trails, but Jasna is the largest ski resort in Central Europe and is served by the tourist town of Liptovsky Mikulas. Liptovsky Mikulas also offers a range of summer activities such as rafting, kayaking, boating on the lake, fishing, a hot springs aqua park and hiking. There are many places to stay, restaurants and bars in the town. The steep northern slopes of the range are popular with climbers. Other attractions include an 18-hole golf course near Tále. The &quot;Path of the heroes of Slovak national uprising&quot; follows the axis of the mountain range. At the very top there are several huts or hotels that can offer refuge to those who want to traverse the entire range from east to west. Low Tatras are also a popular destination for Czech tourists.

<doc id="310992" wikidata="Q232042" url="?curid=310992" title="The Two Gentlemen of Verona">
<text>The Two Gentlemen of Verona is a comedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1589 and 1593. It is considered by some to be Shakespeare&#x27;s first play, and is often seen as showing his first tentative steps in laying out some of the themes and motifs with which he would later deal in more detail; for example, it is the first of his plays in which a heroine dresses as a boy. The play deals with the themes of friendship and infidelity, the conflict between friendship and love, and the foolish behaviour of people in love. The highlight of the play is considered by some to be Launce, the clownish servant of Proteus, and his dog Crab, to whom &quot;the most scene-stealing non-speaking role in the canon&quot; has been attributed.

&quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; is often regarded as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s weakest plays. It has the smallest named cast of any play by Shakespeare.

==Characters==
&quot;Verona:&quot;

* Valentine – a gentleman
* Proteus – Valentine&#x27;s best friend
* Julia – Proteus&#x27; betrothed
* Launce – Proteus&#x27; servant

* The Host – an innkeeper who helps Julia
* The Outlaws – banished men originally from Milan

==Summary==

Valentine, a gentleman of Verona, is preparing to leave for Milan, accompanied by his servant, Speed, in order to expand his horizons at the Duke of Milan&#x27;s court. He hopes that his best friend, Proteus, will come, but Proteus is unwilling to leave his love, Julia. Disappointed, Valentine departs alone. 

Proteus&#x27;s father, however, has been persuaded that Proteus too needs to further his gentlemanly education, and he orders his son to leave for Milan the very next day, prompting a tearful farewell with Julia, to whom Proteus swears eternal love. The couple exchange rings and vows. Proteus sets off accompanied by his own servant, Launce, and Launce&#x27;s dog, Crab.

In Milan, Valentine has fallen in love with the Duke&#x27;s daughter, Silvia, who clearly prefers this suitor to the wealthy but foppish Thurio who her father intends she should marry. As soon as Proteus arrives, he too falls in love with Silvia. Determined to win her, and agonising only briefly about betraying both his friend and his lover, Proteus slyly tells the Duke that Valentine plans to elope with Silvia, using a corded ladder to rescue her from the tower room in which she is imprisoned each night. The Duke banishes Valentine. Wandering in the forest, Valentine runs into a band of outlaws, who elect him their leader.
Back in Verona, Julia decides to join her lover in Milan and convinces her maid Lucetta to dress her in boy&#x27;s clothes. On arrival in Milan, Julia discovers Proteus&#x27;s love for Silvia and watches him serenade her. To learn more, she contrives to become his page boy, calling herself Sebastian. Proteus sends Julia/Sebastian to Silvia with a gift of a ring that Julia had given him before he left Verona. Silvia scorns Proteus&#x27;s affections, repelled by his inconstancy to the lover he has left behind. 

In despair, Silvia flees into the forest, where she is quickly taken prisoner by the outlaws. They head to their new leader, Valentine, on the way encountering Proteus and Julia/Sebastian. Proteus rescues Silvia but, secretly observed by Valentine, continues to press his unwanted suit. When Proteus tells Silvia that he intends to force himself on her, Valentine intervenes.

Proteus professes to be horrified by his own behaviour. Convinced that Proteus&#x27;s repentance is genuine, Valentine forgives him and says &quot;All that was mine in Silvia I give thee&quot;. At this point, overwhelmed, Julia swoons, revealing her true identity. Proteus suddenly recalls his love for her and vows fidelity once again. 

The Duke and Thurio are brought in by the outlaws. Thurio claims Silvia as his, but Valentine warns that if he makes a move toward her, he will kill him. Terrified, Thurio renounces his claim. The Duke, disgusted by Thurio&#x27;s cowardice and impressed by Valentine&#x27;s actions, approves Valentine&#x27;s and Silvia&#x27;s love and consents to their marriage. The two couples, Valentine and Silvia, and Proteus and Julia, are happily united. The Duke pardons the outlaws and permits their return to Milan.

==Sources==

In writing &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, Shakespeare drew on the Spanish prose romance &quot;Los Siete Libros de la Diana&quot; (&quot;The Seven Books of the Diana&quot;) by the Portuguese writer Jorge de Montemayor. In the second book of &quot;Diana&quot;, Don Felix, who is in love with Felismena, sends her a letter explaining his feelings. Like Julia, Felismena pretends to reject the letter and be annoyed with her maid for delivering it. Like Proteus, Felix is sent away by his father, and is followed by Felismena, who, disguised as a boy, becomes his page, only to subsequently learn that Felix has fallen in love with Celia. Felismena is then employed by Felix to act as his messenger in all communications with Celia, who scorns his love. Instead, Celia falls in love with the page (i.e. Felismena in disguise). Eventually, after a combat in a wood, Felix and Felismena are reunited. Upon Felismena revealing herself, however, Celia, having no counterpart to Valentine, dies of grief.

&quot;Diana&quot; was published in Spanish in 1559 and translated into French by Nicholas Collin in 1578. An English translation was made by Bartholomew Young and published in 1598, though Young claims in his preface to have finished the translation sixteen years earlier (c. 1582). Shakespeare could have read a manuscript of Young&#x27;s English translation, or encountered the story in French, or learned of it from an anonymous English play, &quot;The History of Felix and Philomena&quot;, which may have been based on &quot;Diana&quot;, and which was performed for the court at Greenwich Palace by the Queen&#x27;s Men on 3 January 1585. &quot;The History of Felix and Philiomena&quot; is now lost.
Another major influence on Shakespeare was the story of the intimate friendship of Titus and Gisippus as told in Thomas Elyot&#x27;s &quot;The Boke Named the Governour&quot; in 1531 (the same story is told in &quot;The Decameron&quot; by Giovanni Boccaccio, but verbal similarities between &quot;The Two Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;The Governor&quot; suggest it was Elyot&#x27;s work Shakespeare used as his primary source, not Boccaccio&#x27;s). In this story, Titus and Gisippus are inseparable until Gisippus falls in love with Sophronia. He introduces her to Titus, but Titus is overcome with jealousy and vows to seduce her. Upon hearing of Titus&#x27; plan, Gisippus arranges for them to change places on the wedding night, thus placing their friendship above his love.

Also important to Shakespeare in the composition of the play was John Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit&quot;, published in 1578. Like &quot;The Governor&quot;, &quot;Euphues&quot; presents two close friends who are inseparable until a woman comes between them, and, like both &quot;The Governor&quot; and &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;, the story concludes with one friend sacrificing the woman so as to save the friendship. However, as Geoffrey Bullough argues &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s debt to Lyly was probably one of technique more than matter.&quot; Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Midas&quot; may also have influenced the scene where Launce and Speed run through the milkmaid&#x27;s virtues and defects, as it contains a very similar scene between Lucio and Petulus.

Other minor sources include Arthur Brooke&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot;, Shakespeare&#x27;s source for &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It features a character called Friar Laurence, as does &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;, and a scene where a young man attempts to outwit his lover&#x27;s father by means of a corded ladder (as Valentine does in &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;). Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; may also have influenced Shakespeare insofar as it contains a character who follows her betrothed, dressed as his page, and later on, one of the main characters becomes captain of a group of Helots.

==Date and text==

===Date===

The exact date of composition of &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; is unknown, but it is generally believed to have been one of Shakespeare&#x27;s earliest works. The first evidence of its existence is in a list of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays in Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, published in 1598, but it is thought to have been written in the early 1590s. Clifford Leech, for example, argues for 1592/1593; G. Blakemore Evans places the date at 1590–1593; Gary Taylor suggests 1590–1591; Kurt Schlueter posits the late 1580s; William C. Carroll suggests 1590–1592; Roger Warren tentatively suggests 1587, but acknowledges 1590/1591 as more likely.

It has been argued that &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; may have been Shakespeare&#x27;s first work for the stage. This theory was first suggested by Edmond Malone in 1821, in the &quot;Third Variorum&quot; edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, edited by James Boswell based on Malone&#x27;s notes. Malone dated the play 1591, a modification of his earlier 1595 date from the third edition of &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot;. At this time, the dominant theory was that the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy had been Shakespeare&#x27;s first work. More recently, the play was placed first in &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works&quot; of 1986, again in the 2nd edition of 2005, and again in the &quot;New Oxford Shakespeare&quot; edition of 2016, in &quot;The Norton Shakespeare&quot; of 1997, and again in the 2nd edition of 2008, and in &quot;The Complete Pelican Shakespeare&quot; of 2002.

A large part of the theory that this may be Shakespeare&#x27;s first play is the quality of the work itself. Writing in 1968, Norman Sanders argued &quot;all are agreed on the play&#x27;s immaturity.&quot; The argument is that the play betrays a lack of practical theatrical experience on Shakespeare&#x27;s part, and as such, it must have come extremely early in his career. Stanley Wells, for example, has written the &quot;dramatic structure is comparatively unambitious, and while some of its scenes are expertly constructed, those involving more than, at the most, four characters betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.&quot; This uncertainty can be seen in how Shakespeare handles the distribution of dialogue in such scenes. Whenever there are more than three characters on stage, at least one of those characters tends to fall silent. For example, Speed is silent for almost all of 2.4, as are Thurio, Silvia and Julia for most of the last half of the final scene. It has also been suggested that the handling of the final scene in general, in which the faithful lover seemingly offers his beloved as a token of his forgiveness to the man who has just attempted to rape her, is a sign of Shakespeare&#x27;s lack of maturity as a dramatist.

In his 2008 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren argues that the play is the oldest surviving piece of Shakespearean literature, suggesting a date of composition as somewhere between 1587 and 1591. He hypothesizes that the play was perhaps written before Shakespeare came to London, with an idea towards using the famous comic actor Richard Tarlton in the role of Launce (this theory stems from the fact that Tarlton had performed several extremely popular and well-known scenes with dogs). However, Tarlton died in September 1588, and Warren notes several passages in &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; which seem to borrow from John Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Midas&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t written until at least late 1589. As such, Warren acknowledges that 1590/1591 is most likely the correct date of composition.

===Text===
The play was not printed until 1623, when it appeared in the &quot;First Folio&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==Criticism and analysis==
=== Critical history ===
Perhaps the most critically discussed issue in the play is the sequence, bizarre by modern Western standards, in 5.4, in which Valentine seems to &#x27;give&#x27; Silvia to Proteus as a sign of his friendship. For many years, the general critical consensus on this issue was that the incident revealed an inherent misogyny in the text. For example, Hilary Spurling wrote in 1970, &quot;Valentine is so overcome [by Proteus&#x27;s apology] that he promptly offers to hand over his beloved to the man who, not three minutes before, had meant to rape her.&quot; Modern scholarship, however, is much more divided about Valentine&#x27;s actions at the end of the play, with some critics arguing that he does not offer to give Silvia to Proteus at all. The ambiguity lies in the line &quot;All that was mine in Silvia I give thee&quot; (5.4.83). Some critics (such as Stanley Wells, for example) interpret this to mean that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to her would-be rapist, but another school of thought suggests that Valentine simply means &quot;I will love you [Proteus] with as much love as I love Silvia,&quot; thus reconciling the dichotomy of friendship and love as depicted elsewhere in the play. This is certainly how Jeffrey Masten, for example, sees it, arguing that the play as a whole &quot;reveals not the opposition of male friendship and Petrarchan love but rather their interdependence.&quot; As such, the final scene &quot;stages the play&#x27;s ultimate collaboration of male friendship and its incorporation of the plot we would label &quot;heterosexual&quot;.&quot;

This is also how Roger Warren interprets the final scene. Warren cites several productions of the play as evidence for this argument, including Robin Phillips&#x27; Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production in 1970, where Valentine kisses Silvia, makes his offer and then kisses Proteus. Another staging cited by Warren is Edward Hall&#x27;s 1998 Swan Theatre production. In Hall&#x27;s version of the scene, after Valentine says the controversial line, Silvia approaches him and takes him by the hand. They remain holding hands for the rest of the play, clearly suggesting that Valentine has not &#x27;given&#x27; her away. Warren also mentions Leon Rubin&#x27;s 1984 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production (where the controversial line was altered to &quot;All my love to Silvia I also give to thee&quot;), David Thacker&#x27;s 1991 Swan Theatre production, and the 1983 &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; adaptation as supporting the theory that Valentine is not giving Silvia away, but is simply promising to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia. Patty S. Derrick also interprets the BBC production in this manner, arguing that &quot;Proteus clearly perceives the offer as a noble gesture of friendship, not an actual offer, because he does not even look towards Silvia but rather falls into an embrace with Valentine&quot; (although Derrick does raise the question that if Valentine is &quot;not&quot; offering Silvia to Proteus, why does Julia swoon?).

There are other theories regarding this final scene, however. For example, in his 1990 edition of the play for the &quot;New Cambridge Shakespeare&quot;, Kurt Schlueter suggests that Valentine is indeed handing Silvia over to Proteus, but the audience is not supposed to take it literally; the incident is farcical, and should be interpreted as such. Schlueter argues that the play provides possible evidence it was written to be performed and viewed primarily by a young audience, and as such, to be staged at university theatres, as opposed to public playhouses. Such an audience would be more predisposed to accepting the farcical nature of the scene, and more likely to find humorous the absurdity of Valentine&#x27;s gift. As such, in Schlueter&#x27;s theory, the scene represent what it appears to represent; Valentine does give Silvia to her would-be rapist, but it is done purely for comic effect.
Another theory is provided by William C. Carroll in his 2004 edition for the Arden Shakespeare, Third Series. Carroll argues, like Schlueter, that Valentine is indeed giving Silvia to Proteus, but unlike Schlueter, Carroll detects no sense of farce. Instead, he sees the action as a perfectly logical one in terms of the notions of friendship which were prevalent at the time:

As in Schlueter, Carroll here interprets Valentine&#x27;s actions as a gift to Proteus, but unlike Schlueter, and more in line with traditional criticism of the play, Carroll also argues that such a gift, as unacceptable as it is to modern eyes, is perfectly understandable when one considers the cultural and social &quot;milieu&quot; of the play itself.

===Language===
Language is of primary importance in the play insofar as Valentine and Proteus speak in blank verse, but Launce and Speed speak (for the most part) in prose. More specifically, the actual content of many of the speeches serve to illustrate the pompousness of Valentine and Proteus&#x27;s exalted outlook, and the more realistic and practical outlook of the servants. This is most apparent in 3.1. Valentine has just given a lengthy speech lamenting his banishment and musing on how he cannot possibly survive without Silvia; &quot;Except I be by Silvia in the night/There is no music in the nightingale./Unless I look on Silvia in the day/There is no day for me to look upon&quot; (ll.178–181). However, when Launce enters only a few lines later, he announces that he too is in love, and proceeds to outline, along with Speed, all of his betrothed&#x27;s positives (&quot;She brews good ale&quot;; &quot;She can knit&quot;; &quot;She can wash and scour&quot;), and negatives (&quot;She hath a sweet mouth&quot;; &quot;She doth talk in her sleep&quot;; &quot;She is slow in words&quot;). After weighing his options, Launce decides that the woman&#x27;s most important quality is that &quot;she hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults&quot; (ll.343–344). He announces that her wealth &quot;makes the faults gracious&quot; (l.356), and chooses for that reason to wed her. This purely materialistic reasoning, as revealed in the form of language, is in stark contrast to the more spiritual and idealised love espoused by Valentine earlier in the scene.

===Themes===
One of the dominant theories as regards the value of &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; is that thematically, it represents a &#x27;trial run&#x27; of sorts, in which Shakespeare deals briefly with themes which he would examine in more detail in later works. E. K. Chambers, for example, believed that the play represents something of a gestation of Shakespeare&#x27;s great thematic concerns. Writing in 1905, Chambers stated that &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;

As such, the play&#x27;s primary interest for critics has tended to lie in relation to what it reveals about Shakespeare&#x27;s conception of certain themes before he became the accomplished playwright of later years. Writing in 1879, A.C. Swinburne, for example, states &quot;here is the first dawn of that higher and more tender humour that was never given in such perfection to any man as ultimately to Shakespeare.&quot; Similarly, in 1906, Warwick R. Bond writes &quot;Shakespeare first opens the vein he worked so richly afterwards – the vein of crossed love, of flight and exile under the escort of the generous sentiments; of disguised heroines, and sufferings endured and virtues exhibited under their disguise; and of the Providence, kinder than life, that annuls the errors and forgives the sin.&quot; More recently, Stanley Wells has referred to the play as a &quot;dramatic laboratory in which Shakespeare first experimented with the conventions of romantic comedy which he would later treat with a more subtle complexity, but it has its own charm.&quot;
Other critics have been less kind, however, arguing that if the later plays show a skilled and confident writer exploring serious issues of the human heart, &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; represents the initial, primarily unsuccessful attempt to do likewise. In 1921, for example, J. Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller-Couch, in their edition of the play for the Cambridge Shakespeare, famously stated that after hearing Valentine offer Silvia to Proteus &quot;one&#x27;s impulse, upon this declaration, is to remark that there are, by this time, &quot;no&quot; gentlemen in Verona.&quot; H.B. Charlton, writing in 1938, argues that &quot;clearly, Shakespeare&#x27;s first attempt to make romantic comedy had only succeeded so far as it had unexpectedly and inadvertently made romance comic.&quot; Another such argument is provided by Norman Sanders in 1968; &quot;because the play reveals a relatively unsure dramatist and many effects managed with a tiro&#x27;s lack of expertise, it offers us an opportunity to see more clearly than anywhere else in the canon what were to become characteristic techniques. It stands as an &#x27;anatomie&#x27; or show-through version, as it were, of Shakespeare&#x27;s comic art.&quot; Kurt Schlueter, on the other hand, argues that critics have been too harsh on the play precisely because the later plays are so much superior. He suggests that when looking at Shakespeare&#x27;s earlier works, scholars put too much emphasis on how they fail to measure up to the later works, rather than looking at them for their own intrinsic merits; &quot;we should not continue the practice of holding his later achievements against him when dealing with his early beginnings.&quot;

====Love and friendship====
Norman Sanders calls the play &quot;almost a complete anthology of the practices of the doctrine of romantic love which inspired the poetic and prose Romances of the period.&quot; At the very centre of this is the contest between love and friendship; &quot;an essential part of the comicality of &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; is created by the necessary conflict between highly stylised concepts of love and friendship.&quot; This is manifested in the question of whether the relationship between two male friends is more important than that between lovers, encapsulated by Proteus&#x27;s rhetorical question at 5.4.54; &quot;In love/Who respects friend?&quot; This question &quot;exposes the raw nerve at the heart of the central relationships, the dark reality lurking beneath the wit and lyricism with which the play has in general presented lovers&#x27; behaviour.&quot; In the program notes for John Barton&#x27;s 1981 RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Anne Barton, his wife, wrote that the central theme of the play was &quot;how to bring love and friendship into a constructive and mutually enhancing relationship.&quot; As William C. Carroll points out, this is a common theme in Renaissance literature, which often celebrates friendship as the more important relationship (because it is pure and unconcerned with sexual attraction), and contends that love and friendship cannot co-exist. As actor Alex Avery argues, &quot;The love between two men is a greater love for some reason. There seems to be a sense that the function of a male/female relationship is purely for the family and to procreate, to have a family. But a love between two men is something that you choose. You have arranged marriages, [but] a friendship between two men is created by the desires and wills of those two men, whereas a relationship between a man and a girl is actually constructed completely peripheral to whatever the feelings of the said boy and girl are.&quot;

Carroll sees this societal belief as vital in interpreting the final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine does give Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting in accordance with the practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does &quot;not&quot; give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten argue, but instead offers to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to love his friend as much as he does his betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.

====Foolishness of lovers====
Another major theme is the foolishness of lovers, what Roger Warren refers to as &quot;mockery of the absurdity of conventional lovers&#x27; behaviour.&quot; Valentine for example, is introduced into the play mocking the excesses of love; &quot;To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans/Coy looks with heart-sore sighs, one fading moment&#x27;s mirth/With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights&quot; (1.1.29–31). Later, however, he becomes as much a prisoner of love as Proteus, exclaiming, &quot;For in revenge of my contempt for love/Love hath chased sleep from my enthrall&#x27;d eyes/And made them watchers of my own heart&#x27;s sorrow&quot; (2.4.131–133).

The majority of the cynicism and mockery as regards conventional lovers, however, comes from Launce and Speed, who serve as foils for the two protagonists, and &quot;supply a mundane view of the idealistic flights of fancy indulged in by Proteus and Valentine.&quot; Several times in the play, after either Valentine or Proteus has made an eloquent speech about love, Shakespeare introduces either Launce or Speed (or both), whose more mundane concerns serve to undercut what has just been said, thus exposing Proteus and Valentine to mockery. For example, in 2.1Act 2, Scene 1, as Valentine and Silvia engage in a game of flirtation, hinting at their love for one another, Speed provides constant asides which serve to directly mock the couple;

====Inconstancy====
A third major theme is inconstancy, particularly as manifested in Proteus, whose very name hints at his changeable mind (in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Proteus is a sea-god forever changing its shape). At the start of the play, Proteus has only eyes for Julia. However, upon meeting Silvia, he immediately falls in love with her (although he has no idea why). He then finds himself drawn to the page Sebastian (Julia in disguise) whilst still trying to woo Silvia, and at the end of the play, he announces that Silvia is no better than Julia and vows he now loves Julia again. Indeed, Proteus himself seems to be aware of this mutability, pointing out towards the end of the play; &quot;O heaven, were man/But constant, he were perfect. That one error/Fills him with faults, makes him run through all th&#x27;sins;/Inconstancy falls off ere it begins&quot; (5.4.109–112).

==Performance==

There is no record of a performance during Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime, although due to its inclusion in Francis Meres&#x27; &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, we know the play had definitely been performed by 1598. The earliest known performance was at Drury Lane in 1762. However, this production was of a version of the play rewritten by Benjamin Victor. The earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Covent Garden in 1784, advertised as &quot;Shaxespeare&#x27;s with alterations.&quot; Although the play was supposed to run for several weeks, it closed after the first night.

From the middle of the eighteenth century, even if staging Shakespeare&#x27;s original (as opposed to Victor&#x27;s rewrite) it was common to cut the lines in the final scene where Valentine seems to offer Silvia to Proteus. This practice prevailed until William Macready reintroduced the lines in 1841 in a production at Drury Lane, although they were still being removed as late as 1952, in Denis Carey&#x27;s production at the Bristol Old Vic. Notable nineteenth-century performances include Charles Kean&#x27;s 1848 production at the Haymarket Theatre, Samuel Phelps&#x27; 1857 production at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre and William Poel&#x27;s 1892 and 1896 productions.

During the twentieth century, the play has been produced sporadically in the English-speaking world, although it has proved more popular in Europe. Indeed, there have been only a few significant English-speaking productions. Little is known, for example, about Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s 1904 production at the Court Theatre, F.R. Benson&#x27;s 1910 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Robert Atkins&#x27; 1923 production at the Apollo Theatre, or Ben Iden Payne&#x27;s 1938 production at Stratford-upon-Avon. The earliest production about which we have significant information is Michael Langham&#x27;s 1957 production at The Old Vic, starring Richard Gale as Valentine, Keith Michell as Proteus, Barbara Jefford as Julia and Ingrid Hafner as Silvia. In this production, set in late nineteenth-century Italy and grounded very much in high Romanticism, Proteus threatens to kill himself with a pistol at the end of the play, prompting Valentine&#x27;s hasty offer of Silvia.

Perhaps the most notable 20th-century production was Peter Hall&#x27;s 1960 production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Set in a late medieval &quot;milieu&quot;, the play starred Denholm Elliott as Valentine, Derek Godfrey as Proteus, Susan Maryott as Silvia, Frances Cuka as Julia, and featured a much-lauded performance by Patrick Wymark as Launce. Hall had only recently been appointed as Artistic Director of the RSC, and, somewhat unexpectedly, he chose &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; as his inaugural production, billed as the opening show in a re-examination of the development of Shakespearean comedy.
Ten years later, in 1970, Robin Phillips&#x27; RSC production starred Peter Egan as Valentine, Ian Richardson as Proteus, Helen Mirren as Julia, Estelle Kohler as Silvia, and Patrick Stewart as Launce. This production concentrated on the issues of friendship and treachery and set the play in a decadent world of social elitism. Valentine and Proteus were presented as aristocratic students, the Duke was a Don, and Eglamour an old scoutmaster. On the other hand, the poverty-stricken outlaws were dressed in animal skins.

The RSC again staged the play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1981, as a double bill with &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, with both plays heavily edited. Directed by John Barton, the production starred Peter Chelsom as Valentine, Peter Land as Proteus, Julia Swift as Julia and Diana Hardcastle as Silvia. This production saw the actors not involved in the current on-stage scene sit at the front of the stage and watch the performance. Leon Rubin directed a performance at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 1984, where the actors were dressed in modern clothes and contemporary pop music was featured within the play (for example, the outlaws are portrayed as an anarchic rock group).

A 1991 RSC production at the Swan Theatre saw director David Thacker use an on-stage band for the duration of the play, playing music from the 1930s, such as Cole Porter and George Gershwin. Thacker&#x27;s production featured Hugh Bonneville (then billed as Richard Bonneville) as Valentine, Finbar Lynch as Proteus, Clare Holman as Julia and Saskia Reeves as Silvia. In 1992, Thacker&#x27;s production moved to the Barbican Centre, and in 1993 went on regional tour. In 1996, Jack Shepherd directed a modern dress version at the Royal National Theatre as part of Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe&#x27;s &quot;Prologue Season&quot;. The production starred Lenny James as Valentine, Mark Rylance as Proteus, Stephanie Roth Haberle as Julia and Anastasia Hille as Silvia. Another RSC production took place at the Swan in 1998, under the direction of Edward Hall, and starring Tom Goodman-Hill as Valentine, Dominic Rowan as Proteus, Lesley Vickerage as Julia and Poppy Miller as Silvia. This production set the play in a grimy unnamed contemporary city where material obsession was all-encompassing.
In 2004, Fiona Buffini directed a touring production for the RSC. Premiering at the Swan, the production starred Alex Avery as Valentine, Laurence Mitchell as Proteus, Vanessa Ackerman as Julia and Rachel Pickup as Silvia. Buffini set the play in a swinging 1930s &quot;milieu&quot;, and featuring numerous dance numbers. Additionally, London and New York replaced Verona and Milan; initially, Valentine and Proteus are shown as living in the English countryside, in a rural paradise devoid of any real vitality, the sons of wealthy families who have retired from the city. When Valentine leaves, he heads to New York to pursue the American Dream and falls in love with Silvia, the famous actress daughter of a powerful media magnate. Another change to the play was that the roles of the outlaws (represented here as a group of paparazzi) were increased considerably. Scenes added to the play show them arriving in New York and going about their daily business, although none of the new scenes featured any dialogue. Another performance worth noting occurred at the Courtyard Theatre in Stratford in 2006. A non-professional acting company from Brazil, named Nós do Morro, in collaboration with a Gallery 37 group from Birmingham, gave a single performance of the play during the RSC&#x27;s presentation of the Complete Works, directed by Guti Fraga. The production was spoken in Portuguese, with the original English text projected as surtitles onto the back of the stage. It also featured two 17-year-olds in the roles of Valentine and Proteus (usually, actors in their 20s are cast), and Crab was played not by a dog, but by a human actor in a dog costume. In 2009, Joe Dowling directed the play at the Guthrie Theater, starring Sam Bardwell as Valentine, Jonas Goslow as Proteus, Sun Mee Chomet as Julia and Valeri Mudek as Silvia. Staged as a 1950s live television production, large black-and-white monitors were set on either side of the stage, with cameras feeding the action to them. Additionally, period advertisements appeared both before the show and during the intermission. The actors spoke the original dialogue but wore 1950s clothing. Rock and roll music and dance sequences were occasionally mixed with the action.

In 2011, Laura Cole directed a production at the Shakespeare Tavern. Presented as an &quot;in repertory&quot; production, alongside &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, it starred Kenneth Wigley as Valentine, Jonathan Horne as Proteus, Amee Vyas as Julia and Kati Grace Morton as Silvia. In 2012, P.J. Paparelli directed a Shakespeare Theatre Company production at the Lansburgh Theatre, starring Andrew Veenstra as Valentine, Nick Dillenburg as Proteus, Natalie Mitchell as Silvia and Miriam Silverman as Julia. Set in the 1990s, and featuring a contemporary soundtrack, mobile phones and guns, the production downplayed the comedy and instead presented the play as a semi-tragic coming-of-age story. Reviews were mixed, with most critics impressed with the attempts to do something new with the play, but not universally sure the new ideas worked. Also in 2012, a touring production was staged at various venues throughout the UK, including a performance at the Globe Theatre as part of the Globe to Globe Festival, under the name &quot;Vakomana Vaviri Ve Zimbabwe&quot; (&quot;The Two Gentlemen from Zimbabwe&quot;). Directed by Arne Pohlmeier, and spoken in Shona, the entire play was performed with a cast of two; Denton Chikura and Tonderai Munyevu. In 2014, for the first time since Robin Phillips&#x27; 1970 production, the RSC performed the play in a full production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. Directed by Simon Godwin, the production starred Michael Marcus as Valentine, Mark Arends as Proteus, Pearl Chanda as Julia and Sarah MacRae as Silvia. On 3 September, the play was broadcast live to cinemas around the world as part of the &quot;Live from Stratford-upon-Avon&quot; series. The production received generally positive reviews, with most critics happy to see it back on the RSC stage.

==Adaptations==

===Theatrical===

Benjamin Victor rewrote the play for performance in 1762 (the earliest recorded performance we have of the play), at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. Starring Richard Yates as Launce, his wife, Mary Ann Yates as Julia and Elizabeth Pope as Silvia, Victor brought all of the Verona scenes together, removed Valentine&#x27;s &#x27;gift&#x27; of Silvia to Proteus and increased the roles of Launce and Crab (especially during the outlaw scenes, where both characters are intimately involved in the action). He also switched the emphasis of the play away from the love-friendship dichotomy and instead focused on the issues of fidelity, with the last line of the play altered to, &quot;Lovers must be faithful to be bless&#x27;d.&quot; This necessitated rewriting Valentine as a near-flawless protagonist who represents such faithfulness, and Proteus as a traditional villain, who does not care for such notions. The two are not presented as old friends, but simply as acquaintances. Thurio was also rewritten as a harmless, but lovable fool, not unlike Launce and Speed. Although not a major success (the play initially ran for only six performances), it was still being staged as late as 1895.

In 1790, John Philip Kemble staged his own production of the play at Drury Lane, maintaining many of Victor&#x27;s alterations whilst also adding many of his own. The production starred Richard Wroughton as Proteus and Elizabeth Satchell as Silvia. The play was again staged at Covent Garden in 1808, with Kemble, who was fifty years old at the time, playing Valentine.

The name of Edward Albee&#x27;s 2002 Broadway play &quot;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&quot; references Proteus&#x27;s song to Silvia.

===Opera/musical===
Frederic Reynolds staged an operatic version in 1821 at Covent Garden as part of his series of adaptations of the works of Shakespeare. Reynolds wrote the lyrics, with Henry Bishop writing the music. The production ran for twenty-nine performances, and included some of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets set to music. Augustin Daly revived the opera in 1895 at Daly&#x27;s Theatre, in an elaborate production starring Ada Rehan as Julia.

In 1826, Franz Schubert set a German translation by Eduard von Bauernfeld of Proteus&#x27;s serenade to Silvia (&quot;Who is Silvia? What is she,/That all our swains commend her?&quot;) to music. This song is usually known in English as &quot;Who is Sylvia?,&quot; but in German it is known as &quot;An Sylvia&quot; (&quot;Vier Lieder&quot;, opus 106, number 4, D. 891). In 1909, Eric Coates&#x27;s &quot;Four Old English Songs&quot; included a setting of &quot;Who is Sylvia&quot;. In 1942, Gerald Finzi included a setting of &quot;Who Is Silvia?&quot; in his song cycle on Shakespearean texts &quot;Let Us Garlands Bring&quot;; the title of the work is the last line of the song.

In 1971, Galt MacDermot, John Guare and Mel Shapiro adapted the show into a rock musical under the same name as the play. Guare and Shapiro wrote the book, Guare the lyrics, and MacDermot the music. Opening at the St. James Theatre on 1 December 1971, with Shapiro directing and Jean Erdman as choreographer, it ran for 614 performances, closing on 20 May 1973. During its initial run, the play won two Tony Awards; Best Musical and Best Book. The original cast included Clifton Davis as Valentine, Raul Julia as Proteus, Jonelle Allen as Silvia and Diana Dávila as Julia. The play moved to the West End in 1973, playing at the Phoenix Theatre from 26 April, and running for 237 performances. It was revived in 1996 at the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, directed by Robert Duke, and again in 2005, directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall as part of the Shakespeare in the Park festival. Marshall&#x27;s production was performed at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, and starred Norm Lewis as Valentine, Oscar Isaac as Proteus, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Silvia and Rosario Dawson as Julia.

===Film===
The only cinematic adaptation of the play is &quot;Yī jiǎn méi&quot; (more commonly known by its English title &quot;A Spray of Plum Blossoms&quot;), a 1931 silent film from China, directed by Bu Wancang and written by Huang Yicuo. A loose adaptation of the play, the film tells the story of Bai Lede (Wang Chilong) and Hu Luting (Jin Yan), two military cadets who have been friends since they were children. After graduating, Hu, a playboy uninterested in love, is appointed as a captain in Guangdong and leaves his home town in Shanghai. Bai however, deeply in love with Hu&#x27;s sister, Hu Zhuli (Ruan Lingyu) stays behind. At Guangdong, Hu falls in love with the local general&#x27;s daughter, Shi Luohua (Lim Cho-cho), although the general, Shi (Wang Guilin), is unaware of the relationship, and instead wants his daughter to marry the foolish Liao Di&#x27;ao (Kao Chien Fei). Meanwhile, Bai&#x27;s father uses his influence to get Bai posted to Guangdong, and after a sorrowful farewell between himself and Zhuli, he arrives at his new post and instantly falls in love with Luohua. In an effort to have her for himself, Bai betrays his friend, by informing General Shi of his daughter&#x27;s plans to elope with Hu, leading to Shi dishonourably discharging Hu. Bai tries to win Luohua over, but she is uninterested, only concerned with lamenting the loss of Hu. In the meantime, Hu encounters a group of bandits who ask him to be their leader, to which he agrees, planning on returning for Luohua at some point in the future. Some time passes, and one day, as Luohua, Bai and Liao are passing through the forest, they are attacked. Luohua manages to flee, and Bai pursues her into the forest. They engage in an argument, but just as Bai seems about to lose his temper, Hu intervenes, and he and Luohua are reunited. General Shi arrives in time to see Liao flee the scene, and he now realises that he was wrong to get in the way of the relationship between Hu and his daughter. Hu then forgives Bai his betrayal, and Bai reveals that he has discovered that his only true love is Zhuli back in Shanghai. The film is notable for being one of many Chinese films of the period which, although performed in Mandarin when filming, used English intertitles upon its original release. In the English intertitles and credits, the characters are named after their counterparts in the play; Hu is Valentine, Bai is Proteus, Zhuli is Julia and Luohua is Silvia. Liao is named Tiburio rather than Thurio.

&quot;Two Gentlemen&quot; is also featured in &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; (1998). Directed by John Philip Madden and written by Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, the film tells the fictional story of William Shakespeare&#x27;s (Joseph Fiennes) composition of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Early in the film, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench) attends a production of &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;, greatly enjoying William Kempe (Patrick Barlow) being thoroughly outperformed by Crab, and then falling asleep during Henry Condell&#x27;s (Nicholas Boulton) recitation of Proteus&#x27;s soliloquy from 2.1. Later, after reading the first draft of &quot;Romeo and Ethel&quot;, theatre manager Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) suggests that Shakespeare add a dog to liven the play up.

===Television===
The first television adaptation was in 1952, when BBC Television Service broadcast Act 1 of the play live from the Bristol Old Vic. Directed by Denis Carey, the production starred John Neville as Valentine, Laurence Payne as Proteus, Gudrun Ure as Silvia and Pamela Ann as Julia.

In 1956, the entire play was broadcast on West German TV channel Das Erste from a performance at the Munich Kammerspiele, under the title &quot;Zwei Herren aus Verona&quot;. The theatrical production was directed by Hans Schalla, with the TV adaptation directed by Ernst Markwardt. The cast included Rolf Schult as Valentine, Hannes Riesenberger as Proteus, Helga Siemers as Julia and Isolde Chlapek as Silvia. In 1964, the play was made into a TV movie in West Germany, again using the title &quot;Zwei Herren aus Verona&quot;. Screened on ZDF, it was directed by Hans Dieter Schwarze and starred Norbert Hansing as Valentine, Rolf Becker as Proteus, Katinka Hoffman as Julia and Heidelinde Weis as Silvia. Another West German TV movie, under the title &quot;Die zwei herren aus Verona&quot;, was screened on Das Erste in 1966. Directed by Harald Benesch, it starred Jürgen Kloth as Valentine, Lothar Berg as Proteus, Anne-Marie Lermon as Julia and Carola Regnier as Silvia. In 1969, the entire play was broadcast on Austrian TV channel ORF eins from a performance at the Theater in der Josefstadt, under the title &quot;Zwei aus Verona&quot;. The theatrical production was directed by Edwin Zbonek, with the TV adaptation directed by Wolfgang Lesowsky. The cast included Klaus Maria Brandauer as Valentine, Albert Rueprecht as Proteus, Kitty Speiser as Julia and Brigitte Neumeister as Silvia.
In 1983, the play was adapted for the &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; series, as the fourth episode of the sixth season. Directed by Don Taylor, it starred Tyler Butterworth as Proteus, John Hudson as Valentine, Tessa Peake-Jones as Julia and Joanne Pearce as Silvia. For the most part, the adaptation is taken &quot;verbatim&quot; from the &quot;First Folio&quot;, with some very minor differences. For example, omitted lines include the Duke&#x27;s &quot;Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested&quot; (3.1.34), and Julia&#x27;s &quot;Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine&quot; (4.4.189). Other differences include a slightly different opening scene to that indicated in the text. Whereas the play seems to open with Valentine and Proteus in mid-conversation, the adaptation begins with Mercatio and Eglamour attempting to formally woo Julia; Mercatio by showing her a coffer overflowing with gold coins, Eglamour by displaying a parchment detailing his ancestry. Neither Eglamour nor Mercatio appear in the text. However, there is no dialogue in this scene, and the first words spoken are the same as in the text (&quot;Cease to persuade my loving Proteus&quot;). Eglamour is also present in the final scene, albeit once again without any dialogue, and, additionally, the capture of Silvia and the flight of Eglamour is seen, as opposed to merely being described. The music for the episode was created by Anthony Rooley, who wrote new arrangements of works from Shakespeare&#x27;s own time, such as John Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Lachrimae&quot;. Performed by The Consort of Musicke, other musicians whose music was used include William Byrd, Thomas Campion, Anthony Holborne, John Johnson, Thomas Morley and Orazio Vecchi.

Taylor initially planned a representational setting for the film; Verona, Milan and the forest were all to be realistic. However, he changed his mind early in preproduction and had production designer Barbara Gosnold go in the opposite direction – a stylised setting. To this end, the forest is composed of metal poles with bits of green tinsel and brown sticks stuck to them (the cast and crew referred to the set as &quot;Christmas at Selfridges&quot;). Whilst the set for Verona remained relatively realistic, that for Milan featured young actors dressed like cherubs as extras. This was to convey the idea that the characters lived in a &#x27;Garden of Courtly Love&#x27;, which was slightly divorced from the everyday reality represented by Verona. Working in tandem with this idea, upon Proteus&#x27;s arrival in Milan, after meeting Silvia, he is left alone on screen, and the weather suddenly changes from calm and sunny to cloudy and windy, accompanied by a thunderclap. The implication being that Proteus has brought a darkness within him into the garden of courtly delights previously experienced by Silvia. Although the production is edited in a fairly conventional manner, much of it was shot in extremely long takes, and then edited into sections, rather than actually shooting in sections. Director Don Taylor would shoot most of the scenes in single takes, as he felt this enhanced performances and allowed actors to discover aspects which they never would were everything broken up into pieces.

In 1995, a production of the play aired on Polish TV channel TVP1 under the title &quot;Dwaj panowie z Werony&quot;, directed by Roland Rowiński and starring Rafal Krolikowski as Proteus, Marek Bukowski as Valentine, Agnieszka Krukówna as Julia and Edyta Jungowska as Sylvia.

In 2000, episode three of season four of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Two Gentlemen of Capeside&quot; loosely adapted the plot of the play. Written by Chris Levinson and Jeffrey Stepakoff, and directed by Sandy Smolan, the episode depicts how Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) and Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson), formerly best friends, have been driven apart over their love for the same woman. The play is referenced early in the episode as the characters are reading it for their English class.

===Radio===
In 1923, extracts from the play were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the first episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, entitled &quot;Shakespeare Night&quot;. In 1924, the entire play was broadcast by 2BD, directed by Joyce Tremayne and R.E. Jeffrey, with Treymane playing Silvia and Jeffrey playing Valentine, alongside G.R. Harvey as Proteus and Daisy Moncur as Julia. In 1927, the scenes between Julia and Lucetta were broadcast on BBC Radio as part of the &quot;Echoes from Greenwich Theatre&quot; series. Betty Rayner played Julia and Joan Rayner played Lucetta. BBC National Programme broadcast the full play in 1934, adapted for radio by Barbara Burnham and produced by Lance Sieveking. Ion Swinley played Valentine, Robert Craven was Proteus, Helen Horsey was Silvia and Lydia Sherwood played Julia.

In 1958, the entire play was broadcast on BBC Third Programme. Produced and directed by Raymond Raikes, it starred John Westbrook as Valentine, Charles Hodgson as Proteus, Caroline Leigh as Silvia, Perlita Neilson as Julia, and Frankie Howerd as Launce. BBC Third Programme aired another full production of the play in 1968, produced and directed by R.D. Smith and starring Denys Hawthorne as Valentine, Michael N. Harbour as Proteus, Judi Dench as Julia and Kate Coleridge as Silvia.

In 2007, producer Roger Elsgood and director Willi Richards adapted the play into a radio drama called &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Valasna&quot;. Set in two Indian princely states called Malpur and Valasna in the weeks leading up to the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the play was first broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 29 July 2007. It was recorded on location in Maharashtra, India earlier in 2007 with a cast drawn from Bollywood, Indian television and the Mumbai English-speaking theatre traditions; actors included Nadir Khan as Vishvadev (i.e. Valentine), Arghya Lahiri as Parminder (Proteus), Anuradha Menon as Syoni (Silvia), Avantika Akerkar as Jumaana/Servi (Julia/Sebastian), Sohrab Ardishir as The Maharaja (Duke of Milan) and Zafar Karachiwala as Thaqib (Thurio).

<text>The mIRC scripting language (often unofficially abbreviated to &quot;mSL&quot;) is the scripting language embedded in mIRC and Adiirc, IRC clients for Windows but work with WiNE for Linux.

==Primary uses==
*Light channel and personal protection against many types of attacks (flooding, spamming, takeovers, etc.).
*Dialog windows can be created in mIRC to better serve user-compatibility; rather than everything in popup menus.
**Popular mIRC dialog extensions include MDX (mIRC Dialog Extension) and DCX (Dialog Control Extension). There are also a few versions of mdx.dll and dcx.dll modded by IRC hackers.
*Bots that provide automated IRC channel management, trivia or other games, and other desired functions for chatters.
*Commands that save typing or otherwise simplify life on IRC (such as automatically identifying as the owner of a nickname).
*Proxy CONNECT servers (www.mslscript.com) and Bounce servers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC) to replace some mSL scripting with faster code and convenient features.

==Script storage==
Scripts are stored as either plain text files, usually with a .mrc file extension, or as INI files. They, however, can be stored with any extension. Multiple script files can be loaded at one time, although in some cases, one script will conflict with another and cause one or both of them to no longer work properly. The order in which in the script files are loaded may make a difference if the script functions properly or not. A (un)loader-script MUST be used for semi-large scripts to function as intended.

==Language features==

mIRC scripting language uses its own nomenclature to refer to language constructs. (However, whilst this can be a little confusing to newcomers, they do not impact on the functionality of mSL.)

*Built-in functions are termed commands or, if they return a value, identifiers.
*Custom scripted functions are called aliases. Aliases that return a value are known as custom identifiers. Both are called from the command line or other parts of a script in the same ways as built-in commands and identifiers (and can even supersede them).
*Popups are scripted context menu items. Popups are called when they are selected by the user. The term originally referred to the menus—which pop up upon a right click. It is still used this way in the manual. 
*Remotes are event-handling scripts. Remotes are called when the event they handle occurs.
*All variables are dynamically typed.
*Hash tables are available for larger data storage; arrays are not.
*mIRC scripts make use of sigils. Identifiers (whether custom or built-in) are preceded by codice_1, binary variables are preceded by codice_2, and other variables (whether local or global) are preceded by codice_3. Commands and aliases are not preceded by any particular character (although when entered from a window&#x27;s command line they must be preceded by the command prefix, usually codice_4).

===File handling===
*Scripts can read from and write to files [codice_5 | codice_6 ]
The above is intended for singular access to the file. Because each time you issue codice_7 or codice_6 you open and close the file for access.
Multiple accesses, during a loop for instance, is best handled through codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11. Since this opens the file only once. In some cases codice_12 and codice_13 is an even more efficient (non scripted loop) method.
*Scripts can also copy and delete files. [codice_14 | codice_15]

===Binary variables===
*Contain unlimited (8192 bytes prior to mIRC 6.1) raw data
*Globally accessible via commands and identifiers
*Automatically unset when script returns control to mIRC (and not to another part of a script)
*Prefixed with codice_2 (e.g. codice_17)
*Cannot be accessed other than by codice_18 and codice_19, so these variables cannot be passed onto other parts of the script

===Hash tables===
*May contain unlimited binary data or up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of plain text. This limit is imposed by mIRC&#x27;s scripting parser&#x27;s own line length limitation (unless assigning a binary variable)
*Globally accessible via commands and identifiers
*Automatically unset when exiting mIRC as they are only stored in memory
*Can be saved for later use
*Not prefixed
*Faster than accessing from a file, as hash tables are stored in memory rather than the hard disk
*Size limited only by the computer&#x27;s memory limits.
*Allows any bucket size to be used

===Global variables===
*May contain up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of data including its name (however due to line-length limitations in mIRC&#x27;s scripting parser, a maximum of 4,146 bytes can be assigned explicitly using /set or /var — this number decreasing as the variable&#x27;s name grows longer)
*Cannot store NUL (ASCII 0) or trailing spaces
*Globally accessible
*Do not automatically unset unless a switch is used (stored automatically in a mIRC initialization file)
*Prefixed with codice_3 (e.g. codice_21)
*Created using the codice_22 command or codice_23 or codice_24 notation

===Local variables===
*May contain up to 4,150 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) bytes of data including the variable name (however due to line-length limitations in mIRC&#x27;s scripting parser, a maximum of 4,146 bytes can be assigned explicitly using the /set or /var commands — this number decreasing as the variable&#x27;s name grows longer)
*Can store NUL (ASCII 0) or trailing spaces
*Are destroyed when the triggered alias or event ends
*Prefixed with codice_3 (e.g. codice_21)
*Created using the codice_27 command. codice_27 is merely an internal alias for codice_29 but codice_27 poses the means to declare multiple local variables on a single line (e.g. codice_31)

==Limitations==
*Scripting parser supports a maximum of 8,292 (950 prior to mIRC 6.32) characters per line (not including newlines or indentation).
*Strings are not syntactically enclosed, creating ambiguities in code where characters meant as literal strings are treated as part of the language&#x27;s syntax.
*Each line of code is broken down into a set of space-delimited tokens. As mIRC&#x27;s parser does not support null tokens and the language doesn&#x27;t provide a syntax to clearly differentiate literal strings from code; Prior to mIRC version 6.2 it was impossible to pass multiple consecutive spaces to any command or alias. However, this was fixed with the introduction of the returnex command which allows the preservation of spaces.

==Code examples==
The code below is in the remote scripts format. If placed into an alias file, the command names should not be preceded by the word &quot;codice_32&quot;. Test Comments include the common codice_33 and codice_34.

Here is an example of a Hello World alias:
;Defines the alias &#x27;hello&#x27; in the remote script

;Note: if this is placed in an alias script,
;the &#x27;alias&#x27; part must be removed (result: hello {)
;Usage: /hello

alias hello {

 ;Displays(/echo) &#x27;Hello World!&#x27; into the active window(-a)
 echo -a Hello World!


A remote script to automatically respond to certain text
;Placed in a remote script

;When a user types Hello! in a channel,
;you answer back: Hello, [nickname]!

on *:TEXT:Hello!:#:{ msg $chan Hello, $nick $+ ! }

;When a user types Hello! in a private message,
;you answer back: Hello, [nickname]!

on *:TEXT:Hello!:?: { msg $nick Hello, $nick $+ ! }

;Here is a script which automatically gives voice to a user
;who joins a particular channel (The Bot or user should have HOP)

on *:JOIN:#?: { mode $chan +v $nick }

;A bad word script

on *:Text:die*:#: { .mode $chan +b $nick | kick $chan $nick Dont say that again }

<text>In mathematics, a Green&#x27;s function (or Green function) is the impulse response of an inhomogeneous linear differential operator defined on a domain with specified initial conditions or boundary conditions.

This means that if formula_1 is a linear differential operator, then

* the Green&#x27;s function formula_2 is the solution of the equation where formula_3 is Dirac&#x27;s delta function;
* the solution of the initial-value problem formula_4 is the convolution 

Through the superposition principle, given a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE), one can first solve for each , and realizing that, since the source is a sum of delta functions, the solution is a sum of Green&#x27;s functions as well, by linearity of .

Green&#x27;s functions are named after the British mathematician George Green, who first developed the concept in the 1820s. In the modern study of linear partial differential equations, Green&#x27;s functions are studied largely from the point of view of fundamental solutions instead.

Under many-body theory, the term is also used in physics, specifically in quantum field theory, aerodynamics, aeroacoustics, electrodynamics, seismology and statistical field theory, to refer to various types of correlation functions, even those that do not fit the mathematical definition. In quantum field theory, Green&#x27;s functions take the roles of propagators.

==Definition and uses==
A Green&#x27;s function, , of a linear differential operator acting on distributions over a subset of the Euclidean space at a point , is any solution of

where is the Dirac delta function. This property of a Green&#x27;s function can be exploited to solve differential equations of the form
If the kernel of is non-trivial, then the Green&#x27;s function is not unique. However, in practice, some combination of symmetry, boundary conditions and/or other externally imposed criteria will give a unique Green&#x27;s function. Green&#x27;s functions may be categorized, by the type of boundary conditions satisfied, by a Green&#x27;s function number. Also, Green&#x27;s functions in general are distributions, not necessarily functions of a real variable.

Green&#x27;s functions are also useful tools in solving wave equations and diffusion equations. In quantum mechanics, Green&#x27;s function of the Hamiltonian is a key concept with important links to the concept of density of states.

The Green&#x27;s function as used in physics is usually defined with the opposite sign, instead. That is,
formula_5
This definition does not significantly change any of the properties of Green&#x27;s function due to the evenness of the Dirac delta function.

If the operator is translation invariant, that is, when formula_1 has constant coefficients with respect to , then the Green&#x27;s function can be taken to be a convolution kernel, that is,
formula_7
In this case, Green&#x27;s function is the same as the impulse response of linear time-invariant system theory.

==Motivation==

Loosely speaking, if such a function can be found for the operator , then, if we multiply for the Green&#x27;s function by , and then integrate with respect to , we obtain,
formula_8
Because the operator formula_9 is linear and acts only on the variable (and &quot;not&quot; on the variable of integration ), one may take the operator formula_1 outside of the integration, yielding
formula_11
This means that

is a solution to the equation formula_12

Thus, one may obtain the function through knowledge of the Green&#x27;s function in and the source term on the right-hand side in . This process relies upon the linearity of the operator .

In other words, the solution of , , can be determined by the integration given in . Although is known, this integration cannot be performed unless is also known. The problem now lies in finding the Green&#x27;s function that satisfies . For this reason, the Green&#x27;s function is also sometimes called the fundamental solution associated to the operator .

Not every operator formula_1 admits a Green&#x27;s function. A Green&#x27;s function can also be thought of as a right inverse of . Aside from the difficulties of finding a Green&#x27;s function for a particular operator, the integral in may be quite difficult to evaluate. However the method gives a theoretically exact result.

This can be thought of as an expansion of according to a Dirac delta function basis (projecting over and a superposition of the solution on each projection. Such an integral equation is known as a Fredholm integral equation, the study of which constitutes Fredholm theory.

==Green&#x27;s functions for solving inhomogeneous boundary value problems==
The primary use of Green&#x27;s functions in mathematics is to solve non-homogeneous boundary value problems. In modern theoretical physics, Green&#x27;s functions are also usually used as propagators in Feynman diagrams; the term &quot;Green&#x27;s function&quot; is often further used for any correlation function.

===Framework===
Let formula_1 be the Sturm–Liouville operator, a linear differential operator of the form
formula_15
and let formula_16 be the vector-valued boundary conditions operator
formula_17

Let formula_18 be a continuous function in Further suppose that the problem
formula_19
is &quot;regular&quot;, i.e., the only solution for formula_20 for all is

===Theorem===
There is one and only one solution formula_21 that satisfies
formula_22
and it is given by
formula_23
where formula_24 is a Green&#x27;s function satisfying the following conditions:
# formula_24 is continuous in formula_26 and formula_27.
# For 
# For 
# Derivative &quot;jump&quot;: 
# Symmetry: 

===Advanced and retarded Green&#x27;s functions===

Green&#x27;s function is not necessarily unique since the addition of any solution of the homogeneous equation to one Green&#x27;s function results in another Green&#x27;s function. Therefore if the homogeneous equation has nontrivial solutions, multiple Green&#x27;s functions exist. In some cases, it is possible to find one Green&#x27;s function that is nonvanishing only for formula_28, which is called a retarded Green&#x27;s function, and another Green&#x27;s function that is nonvanishing only for formula_29, which is called an advanced Green&#x27;s function. In such cases, any linear combination of the two Green&#x27;s functions is also a valid Green&#x27;s function. The terminology advanced and retarded is especially useful when the variable x corresponds to time. In such cases, the solution provided by the use of the retarded Green&#x27;s function depends only on the past sources and is causal whereas the solution provided by the use of the advanced Green&#x27;s function depends only on the future sources and is acausal. In these problems, it is often the case that the causal solution is the physically important one. The use of advanced and retarded Green&#x27;s function is especially common for the analysis of solutions of the inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation.

==Finding Green&#x27;s functions==

===Units===
While it does not uniquely fix the form the Green&#x27;s function will take, performing a dimensional analysis to find the units a Green&#x27;s function must have is an important sanity check on any Green&#x27;s function found through other means. A quick examination of the defining equation,
formula_30
shows that the units of formula_2 depend not only on the units of formula_1 but also on the number and units of the space of which the position vectors formula_26 and formula_27 are elements. This leads to the relationship:
formula_35
where formula_36 is defined as, &quot;the physical units of , and formula_37 is the volume element of the space (or spacetime).

For example, if formula_38 and time is the only variable then:
formula_39
If the d&#x27;Alembert operator, and space has 3 dimensions then:
formula_40

===Eigenvalue expansions===
If a differential operator admits a set of eigenvectors (i.e., a set of functions and scalars such that  ) that is complete, then it is possible to construct a Green&#x27;s function from these eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

&quot;Complete&quot; means that the set of functions satisfies the following completeness relation,
formula_41

Then the following holds, 

where formula_42 represents complex conjugation.

Applying the operator to each side of this equation results in the completeness relation, which was assumed.

The general study of Green&#x27;s function written in the above form, and its relationship to the function spaces formed by the eigenvectors, is known as Fredholm theory.

There are several other methods for finding Green&#x27;s functions, including the method of images, separation of variables, and Laplace transforms.

===Combining Green&#x27;s functions===
If the differential operator formula_1 can be factored as formula_44 then the Green&#x27;s function of formula_1 can be constructed from the Green&#x27;s functions for formula_46 and 
formula_47
The above identity follows immediately from taking formula_48 to be the representation of the right operator inverse of analogous to how for the invertible linear operator defined by is represented by its matrix elements 

A further identity follows for differential operators that are scalar polynomials of the derivative, The fundamental theorem of algebra, combined with the fact that formula_49 commutes with itself, guarantees that the polynomial can be factored, putting formula_1 in the form:
formula_51
where formula_52 are the zeros of Taking the Fourier transform of formula_53 with respect to both formula_26 and formula_27 gives:
formula_56
The fraction can then be split into a sum using a partial fraction decomposition before Fourier transforming back to formula_26 and formula_27 space. This process yields identities that relate integrals of Green&#x27;s functions and sums of the same. For example, if formula_59 then one form for its Green&#x27;s function is:
formula_60
While the example presented is tractable analytically, it illustrates a process that works when the integral is not trivial (for example, when formula_61 is the operator in the polynomial).

===Table of Green&#x27;s functions===
The following table gives an overview of Green&#x27;s functions of frequently appearing differential operators, where formula_62 is the Heaviside step function, formula_63 is a Bessel function, formula_64 is a modified Bessel function of the first kind, and formula_65 is a modified Bessel function of the second kind. Where time () appears in the first column, the retarded (causal) Green&#x27;s function is listed.

==Green&#x27;s functions for the Laplacian==
Green&#x27;s functions for linear differential operators involving the Laplacian may be readily put to use using the second of Green&#x27;s identities.

To derive Green&#x27;s theorem, begin with the divergence theorem (otherwise known as Gauss&#x27;s theorem),
formula_66

Let formula_67 and substitute into Gauss&#x27; law.

Compute formula_68 and apply the product rule for the ∇ operator,
formula_69

Plugging this into the divergence theorem produces Green&#x27;s theorem,
formula_70

Suppose that the linear differential operator is the Laplacian, ∇2, and that there is a Green&#x27;s function for the Laplacian. The defining property of the Green&#x27;s function still holds,
formula_71

Let formula_72 in Green&#x27;s second identity, see Green&#x27;s identities. Then,
formula_73

Using this expression, it is possible to solve Laplace&#x27;s equation or Poisson&#x27;s equation , subject to either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. In other words, we can solve for everywhere inside a volume where either (1) the value of is specified on the bounding surface of the volume (Dirichlet boundary conditions), or (2) the normal derivative of is specified on the bounding surface (Neumann boundary conditions).

Suppose the problem is to solve for inside the region. Then the integral
formula_74
reduces to simply due to the defining property of the Dirac delta function and we have
formula_75

This form expresses the well-known property of harmonic functions, that &quot;if the value or normal derivative is known on a bounding surface, then the value of the function inside the volume is known everywhere&quot;.

In electrostatics, is interpreted as the electric potential, as electric charge density, and the normal derivative formula_76 as the normal component of the electric field.

If the problem is to solve a Dirichlet boundary value problem, the Green&#x27;s function should be chosen such that vanishes when either or is on the bounding surface. Thus only one of the two terms in the surface integral remains. If the problem is to solve a Neumann boundary value problem, it might seem logical to choose Green&#x27;s function so that its normal derivative vanishes on the bounding surface. However, application of Gauss&#x27;s theorem to the differential equation defining the Green&#x27;s function yields
formula_77
meaning the normal derivative of &quot;G&quot;(x,x′) cannot vanish on the surface, because it must integrate to 1 on the surface.

The simplest form the normal derivative can take is that of a constant, namely , where is the surface area of the surface. The surface term in the solution becomes
formula_78
where formula_79 is the average value of the potential on the surface. This number is not known in general, but is often unimportant, as the goal is often to obtain the electric field given by the gradient of the potential, rather than the potential itself.

With no boundary conditions, the Green&#x27;s function for the Laplacian (Green&#x27;s function for the three-variable Laplace equation) is
formula_80

Supposing that the bounding surface goes out to infinity and plugging in this expression for the Green&#x27;s function finally yields the standard expression for electric potential in terms of electric charge density as

==Example==
Find the Green function for the following problem, whose Green&#x27;s function number is X11:
formula_81

First step: The Green&#x27;s function for the linear operator at hand is defined as the solution to
If formula_82, then the delta function gives zero, and the general solution is
formula_83

For formula_84, the boundary condition at formula_85 implies
formula_86
if formula_84 and formula_88.

For formula_89, the boundary condition at formula_90 implies
formula_91

The equation of formula_92 is skipped for similar reasons.

To summarize the results thus far:
formula_93

Second step: The next task is to determine formula_94 and 

Ensuring continuity in the Green&#x27;s function at formula_95 implies
formula_96

One can ensure proper discontinuity in the first derivative by integrating the defining differential equation (i.e., ) from formula_97 to formula_98 and taking the limit as formula_99 goes to zero. Note that we only integrate the second derivative as the remaining term will be continuous by construction.
formula_100

The two (dis)continuity equations can be solved for formula_94 and formula_102 to obtain
formula_103

So Green&#x27;s function for this problem is:
formula_104. Then, the Heaviside step function is a Green&#x27;s function of at .
* Let and let the subset be the quarter-plane and be the Laplacian. Also, assume a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed at and a Neumann boundary condition is imposed at . Then the X10Y20 Green&#x27;s function is formula_105
* Let formula_106, and all three are elements of the real numbers. Then, for any function formula_107 with an formula_108-th derivative that is integrable over the interval formula_109: formula_110 The Green&#x27;s function in the above equation, formula_111, is not unique. How is the equation modified if formula_112 is added to formula_24, where formula_114 satisfies formula_115 for all formula_116 (for example, formula_117 with Also, compare the above equation to the form of a Taylor series centered at formula_118.

<doc id="311003" wikidata="Q201670" url="?curid=311003" title="Paul Watson">
<text>Paul Franklin Watson (born December 2, 1950) is a Canadian-American environmental, conservation and animal rights activist, who founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an anti-poaching and direct action group focused on marine conservation activism. The tactics used by Sea Shepherd have attracted opposition, with the group accused of eco-terrorism by both the Japanese government and Greenpeace. Watson is a citizen of Canada and the United States.

Watson, a native of Toronto, has been an environmental activist since his teens. He joined a Sierra Club protest against  nuclear testing in 1969 and crewed onboard the Greenpeace Too in November 1971, to oppose nuclear testing at Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. In 1972, he was a co-founder of Greenpeace. Because Watson argued for a strategy of direct action that conflicted with the Greenpeace interpretation of nonviolence, he was ousted from the board in 1977. Greenpeace has since stated that Watson was an influential early member, but not one of the founders of Greenpeace. That same year, he formed the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The group was the subject of a reality show named &quot;Whale Wars&quot;.

Watson promotes veganism, population reduction and a biocentric, rather than anthropocentric, worldview.

Watson&#x27;s activities have led to legal action from authorities in countries including the United States, Canada, Norway, Costa Rica and Japan. He was detained in Germany on an extradition request by Costa Rica in May 2012. An Interpol red notice was issued on September 14, 2012, at the request of Japan and Costa Rica.

After staying at sea for 15 months following his escape from Germany, where he was released on bail, he returned to Los Angeles in late October 2013, going through customs and &quot;was not arrested&quot;. He appeared before a US appeals court on November 6, 2013, stating that neither he nor the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society violated a 2012 order requiring them to leave whaling vessels alone. Although the United States is a signatory member of Interpol, Watson has not been detained for extradition to Japan or Costa Rica. He is living in Vermont, writing books. He was residing in Paris as of July 1, 2014, but has since returned to the United States.

In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice.

He has created his own foundation, the Captain Paul Watson Foundation, as Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and the board of Sea Shepherd Global removed him. He has also left the executive office of the Australian branch.

In July 2024, Watson was detained in Nuuk by the Danish police, citing an Interpol red notice from Japan. He was expected to stay in pre-trial detention until October 2, 2024; Watson and the Captain Paul Watson Foundation filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to have the decision set aside. After his detention was extended several times, on December 17, 2024, the Danish government decided that Watson would not be extradited to Japan. He was released from prison and is free to return to France.

==Early and personal life==
Paul Watson was born in Toronto, the oldest child of Anthony Joseph Watson and Annamarie Larsen, and grew up in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, along with three younger sisters and three younger brothers. As a child he was a member of the Kindness Club, which he has credited with teaching him to &quot;respect and defend animals&quot;. After working as a tour guide at Expo 67, the World&#x27;s Fair that took place in Montreal in 1967, Watson rode the rails to Vancouver.

In 1968 and the early 1970s, he joined the Canadian Coast Guard, where he served aboard weatherships, search and rescue hovercraft, and buoy tenders. He signed up as a merchant seaman in 1969 with the Norwegian Consulate in Vancouver and shipped out on the 30,000 ton bulk carrier Bris as a deckhand. The Bris was registered in Oslo, Norway, and manifested for the Indian Ocean and Pacific trade. In 1972 he shipped out of San Francisco on the 35,000 ton bulk Swedish carrier &quot;Jarl R. Trapp&quot; and manifested for the Indian Ocean and Pacific trade.

Watson has one daughter, Lilliolani (born 1980), with his first wife, Starlet Lum, who was a founding director of Greenpeace Quebec, Earthforce!, Project Wolf, and Sea Shepherd. His second wife, Lisa Distefano, was Sea Shepherd&#x27;s Director of Operations during the Makah anti-whaling campaigns in Friday Harbor. His third wife, Allison Lance, is an animal rights activist and a volunteer crew member of Sea Shepherd. Watson has two grandchildren. Watson married his fourth wife Yana Rusinovich on February 14, 2015, in Paris. Watson and Rusinovich have two sons. Tiger and Murtagh.

Watson ran for Parliament in Vancouver Centre twice for the Green Party. In 1995, he ran for Mayor of Vancouver for the Green Party..

==Activism==

===Early years===
In October 1969, Watson joined a Sierra Club protest against nuclear testing at Amchitka Island. The group which formed as a result of that protest was the Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee, which evolved into the group known today as Greenpeace. In the early 1970s, Watson was also active with SDU (Students for a Democratic University). Watson sailed as a crew member aboard the &quot;Greenpeace Too!&quot; ship in 1971 and skippered the Greenpeace boat &quot;Astral&quot; in 1972. Paul Watson continued as a crew member, skipper, and officer aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s.

According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and other sources, Watson was a founding member of Greenpeace, but the organization denies this stating he &quot;was an influential early member but not, as he sometimes claims, a founder.&quot; Watson joined Greenpeace on its Amchitka expedition, The Amchitka voyage was one campaign with two ships, the Greenpeace and the Greenpeace Too. Together it was one expedition with the Greenpeace voyage in October and relieved by the Greenpeace Too in November.

===Sea Shepherd Conservation Society===

The first Sea Shepherd vessel, the &quot;Sea Shepherd&quot;, was purchased in December 1978 with assistance from the Fund for Animals and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Sea Shepherd soon established itself as one of the more controversial environmental groups, known for provocative direct action tactics. These tactics have included throwing objects onto the decks of whaling ships, the use of &quot;prop foulers&quot; in an attempt to sabotage the ships, boarding whaling vessels, and the scuttling of two ships in an Icelandic harbor. In January 2013, Watson relinquished captaincy of the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;. The organization and its activities to halt whaling are the focus of a reality TV series, &quot;Whale Wars&quot;, airing on Animal Planet.

In 2010, Watson personally received more than $120,000 from Sea Shepherd.

Because of mounting legal complications, Watson stepped down as head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2013, to abide by an injunction barring him from proximity with Japanese whaling ships. After the resolution of legal issues involving the Japanese Institute for Cetacean Research, Watson returned as President of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Commander of the Sea Shepherd fleet. Watson eventually left Sea Shephard for good on September 3, 2022.

===Other environmental activities===
Watson was a field correspondent for Defenders of Wildlife from 1976 to 1980 and a field representative for the Fund for Animals from 1978 to 1981. Watson also was a co-founder of Friends of the Wolf and Earthforce Environmental Society.

During the 1980s, Watson declared his support for Earth First! and cultivated friendships with David Foreman and Edward Abbey. He proclaimed Sea Shepherd to be the &quot;navy&quot; of Earth First! According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Watson revived the 19th-century practice of tree spiking.

Watson worked with the Green Party of British Columbia in Vancouver in the 1980s and 90s. He ran for mayor in 1996, placing fourth.

In April 2003, Watson was elected to the board of directors of the Sierra Club for a three-year term. In 2006, he did not seek re-election. He resigned from the board a month before his term ended, in protest against the organization&#x27;s sponsorship of a &quot;Why I Hunt&quot; essay contest.

In January 2008, Paul Watson was named by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of its &quot;50 people who could save the planet&quot; for the work of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

===Writings on activism===
Watson published &quot;Earthforce!&quot;, a guide to strategy for environmental activists in 1993. In it, he specifically endorsed the tactics of &quot;monkeywrenching&quot; previously described by Dave Foreman and Edward Abbey. According to Foreman in &quot;Eco-Defense—The Field Guide to Monkey-Wrenching—&quot; these are tactics of sabotage, covert activity, and direct action. Watson says he incorporated his own personal experience in writing the book.

In &quot;Earthforce! An Earth Warrior&#x27;s Guide to Strategy&quot;, Watson expressed disdain for the truthfulness of mainstream media:

The nature of the mass media today is such that the truth is irrelevant. What is true and what is right to the general public is what is defined as true and right by the mass media. Ronald Reagan understood that the facts are not relevant. The media reported what he said as fact. Follow-up investigation was &quot;old news.&quot; A headline comment on Monday&#x27;s newspaper far outweighs the revelation of inaccuracy revealed in a small box inside the paper on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Watson was explicit about what he perceived to be the lack of truthfulness in mass media: &quot;If you do not know an answer, a fact, or a statistic, then simply follow the example of an American President and do as Ronald Reagan did—make it up on the spot and deliver the information confidently and without hesitation.&quot; In a subsequent book, &quot;Ocean Warrior&quot;, Watson expanded on this view, saying: &quot;Survival in a media culture meant developing the skills to understand and manipulate media to achieve strategic objectives.&quot;

In 2007 Watson explained his view of needed population control and the future for humans given their role in the Holocene extinction, which he refers to as the &quot;Holocenic hominid collective suicide event&quot;:

Today, escalating human populations have vastly exceeded global carrying capacity and now produce massive quantities of solid, liquid, and gaseous waste [...] No human community should be larger than 20,000 people and separated from other communities by wilderness areas [...] We need to radically and intelligently reduce human populations to fewer than one billion [...] Curing a body of cancer requires radical and invasive therapy, and therefore, curing the biosphere of the human virus will also require a radical and invasive approach [...] Who should have children? Those who are responsible and completely dedicated to the responsibility which is actually a very small percentage of humans.

==Controversy==
===Separation from Greenpeace===
Paul Watson continued as a crew member, officer, and skipper (in 1972) aboard several Greenpeace voyages throughout the mid-1970s. He considers himself a founding member of Greenpeace and Greenpeace International, a claim Greenpeace disputes despite being pointed out in the documentary, &quot;How to Change the World&quot; which shows that Watson was indeed one of the original founding members of Greenpeace. Watson has since accused Greenpeace of rewriting their history.

In 1977, Watson was expelled from the Greenpeace&#x27;s board of directors by a vote of 11 to 1 (Watson himself cast the single vote against it). The group felt his strong, &quot;front and center&quot; personality and frequently voiced opposition to Greenpeace&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;nonviolence&quot; were too divisive. Watson subsequently left the group. The group has since labeled his actions at the time as those of a &quot;mutineer&quot; within their ranks. That same year, he founded his own group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

During an interview in 1978 with CBC Radio, Watson spoke out against Greenpeace (as well as other organizations) and their role and motives for the anti-sealing campaigns. Watson accused these organizations of campaigning against the Canadian seal hunt because it is an easy way to raise money and it is a profit maker for the organizations.

Greenpeace has called Watson a violent extremist and will no longer comment on his activities.

===Charges and prosecutions===
Watson was sentenced to 10 days in prison and fined $8,000 for his actions during a Canadian seal hunt protest in 1980, after being convicted of assaulting a fisheries officer. Watson served his sentence at Her Majesty&#x27;s Penitentiary, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. He was also found guilty under the Seal Protection Act for painting harp seal pups with red dye to devalue their pelts. Watson was arrested in 1993 in Canada on charges stemming from actions against Cuban and Spanish fishing boats off the coast of Newfoundland. In 1997, Watson was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; and sentenced to serve 120 days in jail by a court in Lofoten, Norway, on charges of attempting to sink the small scale Norwegian fishing and whaling vessel &quot;Nybrænna&quot; on December 26, 1992. Dutch authorities refused to hand him over to Norwegian authorities although he did spend 80 days in detention in the Netherlands pending a ruling on extradition before being released.

There have not been any successful attempts at prosecuting Watson for his activities with Sea Shepherd since the trial in Newfoundland. Watson defends his actions as falling within international law, in particular Sea Shepherd&#x27;s right to enforce maritime regulations against illegal whalers and sealers. 

Sea Shepherd activists Rod Coronado and David Howitt went to Iceland in 1986 and scuttled two whaling ships in port at Reykjavík and also damaged a whale meat processing factory. Watson took responsibility for the operation, abiding by published Sea Shepherd principles. He went to Iceland saying, &quot;I am responsible for all activities undertaken in the name of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. I give the orders.&quot; He was deported without being charged and is considered a persona non grata by Iceland.

In April 2010 the Japanese Coast Guard obtained an arrest warrant for Watson &quot;...on suspicion of ordering sabotage activities against Japan&#x27;s whaling fleet&quot;, and Interpol has listed him as wanted at the request of Japan. The red notice has the charges issued by Japan as, &quot;Breaking into the Vessel, Damage to Property, Forcible Obstruction of Business, Injury&quot;. In March 2012 Interpol issued a &quot;written statement to all 190 member countries making it clear that it would not publish a Red Notice&quot; for the detention of Watson, but reversed that position in September 2012. In both statements Interpol stated that a &quot;Red Notice is not an international arrest warrant&quot; that it is &quot;a request for any country to identify or locate an individual with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition in accordance with the country&#x27;s national laws&quot;.

In May 2012 Watson was detained by German authorities at Frankfurt Airport because of a request from the government of Costa Rica. The charge stemmed from an altercation at sea in 2002 in which Sea Shepherd said that the other vessel was illegally shark finning in Guatemalan waters. Crew members of the other ship accused Sea Shepherd of trying to kill them. Watson was charged with violating navigational regulations with the Interpol alert stating the charge as &quot;peligro de naufragio&quot; (&quot;danger of shipwreck&quot;). The conflict took place during filming for the documentary &quot;Sharkwater&quot; and the charges were dropped by prosecutors after video of the incident made by the documentary film makers was shown. On May 21, Watson was released on bail of €250,000 but required to report to police in Frankfurt on a daily basis. In June, Costa Rica formally requested Watson&#x27;s extradition from Germany. On July 19, 2012, Japan applied for an extradition order and Watson left Germany, resulting in a German court ordering his immediate re-arrest. It is understood the statute of limitations on his Costa Rican charges was set to expire in June 2013.
On August 7, 2012, Interpol renewed the Red Notice for Watson on the charges of &quot;causing a danger of drowning or of an air disaster&quot; laid by Costa Rica. It was reported that Watson would come out of hiding to join Sea Shepherd in the 2012–13 campaign against Japanese whaling. Watson rejoined the crew of the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; in the South Pacific in late November 2012. In March 2019, Costa Rica dropped all charges against Watson and has removed the Interpol red notice. 

On July 21, 2024, Watson was arrested in Greenland—an autonomous territory of Denmark—by Danish authorities due to the red notice issued by Japan against him in 2012. His arrest was announced by Neptune&#x27;s Pirates. The organization criticizes this decision, arguing that &quot;after having been posted online for years, the notice had recently disappeared from the Interpol website, leading Paul Watson and his lawyers to believe that he was now free of his movements”. On October 2, the Nuuk court ordered Paul Watson to remain in custody until October 23, in order to ensure his presence in the context of the extradition decision by the Danish courts. Subsequently, another extension of his detention was issued by the court on October 23, stating that he would be detained until November 13, 2024. This was followed on November 13 by another extension which set the next hearing date as December 2, 2024. On December 2, it was announced that a decision on whether not Watson will be extradited to Japan will be taken by December 18, 2024.

In October 2024, while imprisoned in Greenland, Watson sent a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron requesting political asylum. While Macron has previously expressed his support for Watson and had intervened with the Danish authorities on his behalf after his arrest, there has been no public comment from Macron’s office to Watson&#x27;s letter. Before his imprisonment, Watson was living in France with his wife and two young children.

In December 2024, the Ministry of Justice of Denmark denied Japan&#x27;s request to extradite Watson and as a result he was released from prison. His release was confirmed by his lawyer Julie Stage, who remarked that the charges against him were &quot;groundless&quot;.

===Sierra Club immigration stance===
In 1999, Watson ran unsuccessfully for election to the national Sierra Club Board of Directors, with the backing of the anti-immigration faction Sierrans for US Population Stabilization (SUSPS). After his election to the board in 2003, Watson supported an unsuccessful slate of candidates supporting strict immigration controls as an element of a population stabilization policy. This effort was denounced by another candidate in the election, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, as a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; attempt by &quot;radical anti-immigrant activists.&quot; Watson responded by saying that the only change he was seeking in the organization&#x27;s immigration stance was to restore the position it had held before its 1996 &quot;neutrality policy.&quot; Watson left the Sierra Club board in 2006.

===Anti-sealing activities===

In April 2008, Watson stated that, while the deaths of three Canadian seal hunters (a fourth one is still missing) in a marine accident involving a Canadian Coast Guard vessel and a fishing boat during the 2008 Canadian Commercial Seal Hunt were a tragedy, he felt that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seals is an even greater tragedy. Canadian Federal Fisheries Minister Loyola Hearn accused Watson of trivializing the memory of the lost sealers. Watson replied that Hearn was trying to distract attention from his government&#x27;s incompetence as the boat the men were on capsized while under tow by a Canadian Coast Guard vessel, while his political ambitions continued to support and subsidize an industry that had no place in the 21st century. In 1978, Watson expressed opposition to seal hunt protest organization, suggesting in an interview with CBC&#x27;s Barbara Frum that saving seals is a cheap and easy fundraiser and that seals do not deserve special status over other species. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams was quoted as saying, &quot;I think what a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is that this man is a terrorist.&quot;

===Australian visa issues===
In October 2009, Watson, who carries a US passport, complained to media outlets about having his request for an Australian visa denied. He states that the Australian government was attempting to sabotage the upcoming 2010 Sea Shepherd campaign by denying him entry into the country. Watson and several other shipmates were also unable to join the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot; on its promotional tour of Australia until they were able to provide documentation from the governments of the United States, Canada and Norway, exonerating them from previously claimed acts of violence, specifically claims by Sea Shepherd of intentionally sinking a ship in Norway. In January 2013, Paul Watson was presented with an Aboriginal passport (classified as a fantasy passport and not recognised by the Australian government) by the Krautungalung people of the Gunnai Nation.

===Alleged shooting===
On March 17, 2008, Watson said that he was shot by the Japanese crew or coast guard personnel during the Operation Migaloo anti-whaling campaign in the Southern Ocean. The incident is documented during the season finale of season 1 of the &quot;Whale Wars&quot; TV reality show, and the first six episodes are covered as a buildup to what is portrayed as the major incident during the campaign. The Japanese respond by throwing stun grenades, one crew member is injured from a grenade detonating close behind him and another injured trying to escape the explosions. Watson is then shown reaching inside his jacket and body armour and remarking &quot;I&#x27;ve been hit.&quot; Back inside the bridge of the &quot;Steve Irwin&quot;, a metal fragment is found inside the vest.

The Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research disputes Sea Shepherd&#x27;s statements. The Institute and Coast Guard said that they used seven stun grenades designed to temporarily debilitate a target by rendering them blind and deaf for a period of time. The Japanese government also alleged that the whalers launched &quot;noise balls&quot;, described as &quot;loud explosive deterrent devices&quot;. Neither of the two conflicting accounts have been independently verified. The Australian Foreign Affairs Department had condemned &quot;actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury&quot;. Two media releases were made on the same day from the office. One said that the Australian Embassy in Tokyo had been informed by the Japanese that the whalers had &quot;fired warning shots&quot; while the updated version used the phrase &quot;&#x27;warning balls&#x27; – also known as &#x27;flashbangs&#x27; – had been fired&quot;.

===Accusations of terrorism===
Watson has been called an eco-terrorist by the Japanese government for his direct action tactics against whalers, and it repeated its position after conflicts during the 2009–10 whaling season.

At an animal rights convention in 2002, Paul Watson was also quoted as saying, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being a terrorist, as long as you win. Then you write the history&quot;. In 2010, Fox News commentator Glenn Beck also discussed the comment, criticizing Watson&#x27;s views. Watson responded to Beck&#x27;s comments on the official Sea Shepherd website by stating that he had said that but that it was taken out of context, paraphrasing Gerald Seymour&#x27;s &quot;One man&#x27;s terrorist is another&#x27;s freedom fighter&quot;.

===Comments following 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami===
Watson was criticized for his poem published immediately following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which suggested the disaster was Neptune&#x27;s anger. Watson responded to critics with a commentary on the Sea Shepherd website expressing &quot;deepest concern and sympathy for the people of Japan who are suffering through one of the worst natural disasters in the history of civilization&quot;.

===Criticism of New Zealand===
In 2013, three Sea Shepherd Conservation Society ships docked in New Zealand and were searched by New Zealand authorities to see if Watson was aboard. He was not, having transferred to another ship in international waters, aware New Zealand was required to notify Interpol if he entered the country. Watson criticised the search, accusing New Zealand of siding with Japan on the issue of whaling in the Southern Ocean.

===Split from Sea Shepherd===
On September 3, 2022, Watson announced that he was leaving Sea Shepherd and setting up a new organisation, the Captain Paul Watson Foundation. Watson said &quot;the reason I called it that is because it&#x27;s pretty hard for anyone to infiltrate and take over an organisation that included my name&quot;. In December 2022 the foundation announced their first ship, &#x27;the &quot;John Paul Dejoria II&quot;&#x27;.

==Reactions to activism and leadership==
Watson has stated that he does not consider himself a &#x27;protester&#x27;, but an &#x27;interventionist&#x27;, as he considers protesting as too submissive. He often takes the attitude that he represents (or stands in for) law enforcement which is either unwilling or unable to enforce existing laws.

His leadership style has variously been called arrogant, as well as pushing himself too much &quot;front and center&quot;, which was cited as one of the reasons for expulsion from Greenpeace. The atmosphere aboard his vessels has been compared to an &quot;anarchy run by God&quot;.

The former member of Sea Shepherd and captain of the , Pete Bethune, described Watson as &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; who would order the intentional sinking of his own ships like the &quot;Ady Gil&quot; as a means to &quot;garner sympathy with the public and to create better TV&quot;. Watson denied this, saying, &quot;No one ordered him to scuttle it. Pete Bethune was captain of the &quot;Ady Gil&quot;; all decisions on the &quot;Ady Gil&quot; were his.&quot;

===Awards===
Paul Watson received the Jules Verne Award on October 10, 2012. He was the second person after Captain Jacques Cousteau to be honored with a Jules Verne Award dedicated to environmentalists and adventurers.

===Media portrayals===
A biographical documentary on Paul Watson&#x27;s early life and background entitled &quot;Pirate for the Sea&quot; was produced by Ron Colby in 2008.
The 2008 documentary &quot;At the Edge of the World&quot; chronicled the efforts of Watson and 45 volunteers to hinder the Japanese whaling fleet in the waters around Antarctica. In 2010, long time friend and filmmaker Peter Brown released the documentary &quot;Confessions of an Eco-Terrorist&quot;, a satirical look back at the last 30 years of actions. The documentary &quot;Eco-Pirate: The Story of Paul Watson&quot; from 2011 features interviews and footage with early Greenpeace members Rex Weyler and Patrick Moore.

Watson, &quot;Whale Wars&quot;, and the Japanese whaling industry were satirized in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Whale Whores&quot;. In its fictional Larry King show, Watson himself was called &quot;an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was OK as long as it served his cause&quot; and &quot;A smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility&quot;.

Watson responded to the &quot;South Park&quot; episode by stating: &quot;My understanding is that the Japanese Prime Minister was not amused and the whalers and dolphin killers are enraged at the way they were portrayed,&quot; Watson said. &quot;That&#x27;s music to my ears. If the humorless whale killers and the bank rollers of the dolphin killers did not like the show, then that&#x27;s all I need to applaud it.&quot;

Watson was portrayed (along with whale biologist, Nan Hauser), during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; episode that aired in 2013, as contributing to the return of the humpback whale populations in the South Pacific.

The 2019 documentary film &quot;Watson&quot;, directed by Lesley Chilcott, features interviews with Watson. The film also aired on Animal Planet on December 22, 2019.

<doc id="311005" wikidata="Q1743012" url="?curid=311005" title="Christian–Jewish reconciliation">
<text>Christian−Jewish reconciliation refers to the efforts that are being made to improve understanding and acceptance between Christians and Jews. There has been significant progress in reconciliation in recent years, in particular by the Catholic Church, but also by other Christian groups.

==Background==

In response to the Holocaust (though earlier accounts of reconciliation exist), and many instances of the persecution of Jews by Christians throughout history (most prominent being the Crusades and the Inquisition), many Christian theologians, religious historians and educators have sought to improve understanding of Judaism and Jewish religious practices by Christians.

There are a number of sensitive issues that continue to impact Christian–Jewish relations.

==Proselytism==

Attempts by Christians to convert Jews to Christianity is an important issue in Christian–Jewish relations. Groups such as the Anti-Defamation League have described many attempts to convert Jews as antisemitic.

Pope Benedict XVI has suggested that the church should not be targeting Jews for conversion efforts, since &quot;Israel is in the hands of God, who will save it &#x27;as a whole&#x27; at the proper time.&quot; A number of Progressive Christian denominations have publicly declared that they will no longer proselytize Jews. Other mainline Christian and conservative Christian churches have said they will continue their efforts to evangelize among Jews, saying that this is not antisemitic.

A 2008 survey of American Christians by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life found that over 60% of most denominations believe that Jews will receive eternal life after death alongside Christians.

== Roman Catholicism ==
The Second Vatican Council, commonly known as Vatican II, which closed in 1965, was instrumental in producing the document called , which read in part:

To further the goal of reconciliation, the Roman Catholic Church in 1971 established an internal International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations. After the committee met on May 4, 2001, Church officials stated that they would change the way Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools.

This new understanding of the relationship between Christians and Jews is reflected in the revised liturgy of Good Friday in a particular way. The Good Friday Prayer of the Roman Rite had Catholics praying that the &quot;perfidious Jews&quot; might be converted to &quot;the truth&quot;. The ancient meaning of the Latin word in that context was &#x27;unbelieving&#x27;, yet the English cognate &quot;perfidious&quot; had, over the centuries, gradually acquired the meaning of &#x27;treacherous&#x27;. In order to eliminate misunderstanding on this point, Pope Pius XII ordered in 1955 that, in Catholic liturgical books, the Latin word be more correctly translated as &#x27;unbelieving&#x27;, ensuring that the prayer be understood in its original sense: praying for the Jews who remained &quot;unbelieving&quot; concerning the Messiah. The same adjective was used in many of the ancient rituals for receiving non-Christian converts into the Catholic Church.

Owing to the enduring potential for confusion and misunderstanding because of the divergence of English usage from the original Latin meaning, Pope John XXIII ordered that the Latin adjective be dropped from the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews; in 1960 he ordered it removed from all rituals for the reception of Jewish converts.

The term &quot;traditionalist Catholics&quot; is often used to apply to Catholic Christians who are particularly devoted to practicing the ancient traditions of the Church; however, there are also groups calling themselves &quot;traditionalist Catholics&quot; that either reject many of the changes made since Vatican II, or regard Vatican II as an invalid Council, or who broke away entirely from the Catholic Church after Vatican II. Some of these Catholics believe that the pope at the time, and all popes since, have led the majority of Catholic clergy and laity into heresy. They view interfaith dialogue with Jews as unnecessary and potentially leading to a &quot;watering-down&quot; of the Catholic faith.

In 2002, the Pontifical Biblical Commission released &quot;The Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures&quot;. In this document, the Catholic Church further clarifies its current position on Jews and their Scriptures, taking careful steps to avoid the appearance of sanctioning any Catholic hostility toward Jews. The Commission writes, &quot;Jewish messianic expectation is not in vain. It can become for us Christians a powerful stimulant to keep alive the eschatological dimension of our faith. Like them, we too live in expectation. The difference is that for us the One who is to come will have the traits of the Jesus who has already come and is already present and active among us.&quot; It continues, &quot;It cannot be said, therefore, that Jews do not see what has been proclaimed in the text, but that the Christian, in the light of Christ and in the Spirit, discovers in the text an additional meaning that was hidden there.&quot;

In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, implied that Jews do not need to be converted to find salvation, and that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism. The aftermath of the document&#x27;s release caused intense internal debate within the Catholic Church, since it seemed to contradict the Church&#x27;s teaching (&#x27;outside the Church there is no salvation&#x27;) and since in 1985 the Church had rejected dual-covenant theology. The Vatican responded by clarifying that the 2015 statement cannot be understood as a doctrinal statement containing binding Catholic teaching. The incident highlighted ongoing debate within the Catholic Church over supersessionism and the meaning of the &quot;Old Covenant&quot; of the Jews in relation to the New Covenant of Christ.

Pope Francis has been considered to be particularly instrumental in furthering Catholic-Jewish relations. During a visit to a synagogue, Francis echoed Pope John Paul II&#x27;s statement that Jews are the &quot;elder brothers&quot; of Christians, and further stated: &quot;in fact you are our brothers and sisters in faith. We all belong to one family, the family of God, who accompanies and protects us, His people.&quot;

==Protestant churches==

While there were attempts at Protestant–Jewish dialogue throughout history, one of the most significant dialogues occurred around the 15th century; when Protestant Christian Hebraists began discovering and sympathizing with Karaite Judaism and its perceived similarities regarding scripturalism. This interest was expanded upon by Protestant attempts to parallel Karaite struggles against Rabbanite Jews to their own struggles against the Catholic Church. Christian scholar Johann Uppendorff invited Karaite spiritual leader Solomon Ben Aaron to explain the origins of the Karaites, which the latter would in his work . Mordecai ben Nissan would write the historiographical and at the behest of Jacob Trigland and King Charles XII of Sweden respectively. Karaites, in turn, began trying to harmonize with Christian authorities. Mordecai Sultansky, in his work , claimed that Karaite Judaism was commended by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who said: &quot;You who are loyal to Israel in your faith, and righteous in your deeds, and upright in your behavior, and have done no evil to Christians, since you were not in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period[...] it is therefore fitting that you should be present in European areas among the Christians and they will love you and give you great benefits.&quot;

In its Driebergen Declaration (1991), the European Lutheran Commission on the Church and the Jewish People rejected the historical Christian &quot;teaching of contempt&quot; towards Jews and Judaism, and in particular, the anti-Jewish writings of Martin Luther, and called for the reformation of church practice in the light of these insights.

== Christian Scholars Group ==
The Christian Scholars Group on Christian–Jewish Relations is a group of 22 Christian scholars, theologians, historians and clergy from six Christian Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church, which works to &quot;develop more adequate Christian theologies of the church&#x27;s relationship to Judaism and the Jewish people.&quot;

== Orthodox Christianity ==

The Eastern Orthodox Church has a history of antisemitism associated with it. For example, the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; were published under the aegis of Orthodox priests in Tsarist Russia. The Orthodox Christian attitude to the Jewish people is seen in the virulently antisemitic eastern Orthodox organizations which arose in the post Soviet eastern bloc.

== Joint efforts ==

The International Council of Christians and Jews (ICCJ) is an umbrella organisation of 38 national Jewish-Christian dialogue organisations worldwide, governed according to the principles of the Ten Points of the Seelisberg Conference, which was held in 1947 to explore the relationship basis of Christianity and antisemitism. The institute was founded in 1987.

In 1993 the ICCJ published &quot;Jews and Christians in Search of a Common Religious Basis for Contributing Towards a Better World&quot;. The document &quot;contains both separate Jewish perspectives and Christian perspectives concerning mutual communication and cooperation as well as a joint view of a common religious basis for Jews and Christians to work together for a better world.[...] These considerations are not &#x27;the&#x27; official theological, philosophical nor ideological underpinnings of the ICCJ and its member organisations, but are an invitation to consider what our work is all about. They have no authority other than their intrinsic world.&quot;

Another initiative to promote joint initiatives between Jews and Christians began in October 2002, with the establishment and approval of the bylaws of the Council of Centers of Jewish-Christian Relations. The Council is an association of centers and institutes in the United States and Canada devoted to enhancing mutual understanding between Jews and Christians. Although most of these centers or institutes are located in the United States, there are also affiliate members from Europe and Israel. Representatives from major Christian and Jewish agencies and religious bodies in the United States are also members.

== Jewish responses ==

The 1906 &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; article on &quot;Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah&quot; notes the following Jewish-Christian reconciliation:

Robert Gordis, a Conservative rabbi, wrote an essay on &quot;Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue&quot;; through his writings and similar writings of other rabbis in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by all parties engaging in interfaith dialogue.

Rabbis from all the non-Orthodox movements of Judaism became involved in inter-faith theological dialogue with a number of Christian churches. Conservative Jews and Reform Jews now commonly engage in inter-faith theological dialogue; a small number of Modern Orthodox rabbis engage in such dialogue as well.

Most Orthodox rabbis do not engage in such dialogue. The predominant position of Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik; he held that Judaism and Christianity are &quot;two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic&quot;. In his view &quot;the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level[...] the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider&quot;. As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible.

However, Rabbi Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but &quot;desirable and even essential&quot; on non-theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism. As a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not cooperate in interfaith discussions between the Catholic Church and Judaism, nor did they participate in the later interfaith dialogues between Protestant Christian groups and the Jewish community.

=== Modern papal views ===
Pope John Paul II made special effort to improve relations between Christianity (Catholicism in particular) and Jews and is often seen as a major figure in opening up dialogue between the Catholic and Jewish communities. He was the first pope to make an official visit to a synagogue, and made official apologies on behalf of the Catholic Church for wrongdoing against Jews throughout history. His theology often posed a dual covenant quality, and referred to Judaism as &quot;the older brother&quot; of Christianity.

Pope Benedict XVI has expressed very similar views to those of some Orthodox rabbis, saying in a 2004 book with Marcello Pera (who was, at the time, president of the Italian Senate) that inter-cultural dialogue could often be positive, but that theological dialogue was practically impossible and not always desirable.

=== National Council of Synagogues ===

The National Council of Synagogues (NCS) is a partnership of the non-Orthodox branches of Judaism. (Orthodox Jews have been invited to join, but Orthodox leaders have ruled that an Orthodox rabbi may not work with non-Orthodox rabbis as a matter of religious principle) This group deals with interfaith issues, and meets regularly with the representatives of the United States Catholic Bishops Conference, the National Council of Churches of Christ and various other denominations and religions. Their goal is to foster religious conversation and dialogue in the spirit of religious pluralism.

=== Today ===

Today the Jewish leaders are having connection with the Christian leaders.

&quot;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&quot; is a statement developed jointly by the NCS and the U.S. Bishops&#x27; Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.

Recently, more than 220 rabbis from all branches of Judaism signed a document called (&quot;Speak the Truth&quot;) that has since been used in Jewish education programs across the U.S.

===Orthodox Rabbinic statement on Christianity===

On 3 December 2015, the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of Orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.

The unprecedented Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity, entitled &quot;To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians&quot;, was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States and Europe and now has over 60 signatories.

===&quot;Between Jerusalem and Rome&quot;===
On 31 August 2017, representatives of the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and presented the Holy See with a statement entitled &quot;Between Jerusalem and Rome&quot;. The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s declaration , whose fourth chapter represents the &quot;Magna Charta&quot; of the Holy See&#x27;s dialogue with the Jewish world. The statement &quot;Between Jerusalem and Rome&quot; does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future.

==Spanish and Portuguese law of return==
On 16 December 1968, Spain formally revoked the Alhambra Decree, the 1492 edict expelling Jews from Spain.

The Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, King Juan Carlos (wearing a skullcap) prayed alongside Israeli president Chaim Herzog and members of the Jewish community in the Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain). The King said that &quot;Sefarad (the Hebrew name for Spain) is no longer nostalgia, nor a place where Jews should feel as if at home, because Hispano-Jews are home in Spain. What matters is the desire to analyse and project the past in regards to our future.&quot;

As of November 2012, Sephardic Jews have been given the right to automatic Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardic Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners). While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardic Jews will be entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain. This made Spain the only nation aside from Israel to grant automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews. Today, the number of Jews in Spain is estimated at 50,000. The deadline for applications under the Spanish law was September 2019, by which time 130,000 Jews had applied.

In April 2013, Portugal passed a law of return, allowing descendants of Sephardic Jews who were expelled in the inquisition to claim Portuguese citizenship provided that they &quot;belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal&quot; without a requirement for residence. The amendment to Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Law on Nationality&quot; was approved unanimously on 11 April 2013. The law came into effect in March 2015, and is open-ended.

<text>The Franklin Automobile Company was a marketer of automobiles in the United States between 1902 and 1934 in Syracuse, New York. Herbert H. Franklin, the founder, began his career in the metal die casting business before establishing his automobile enterprise. Controlled by Herbert H. Franklin it had very few other significant shareholders. Franklin bought its vehicles from the H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company which was only moderately profitable and frequently missed dividends on common stock.

The two major characteristics of their automobiles were their air-cooled engines and in the early years their lightness and responsiveness when compared with other luxury cars.

The Franklin companies suffered financial collapse in April 1934. Aside from his consequent retirement CEO Herbert Franklin&#x27;s lifestyle was unaffected.

==Franklin innovations==
All Franklin cars were air-cooled, which the company considered simpler and more reliable than water cooling, and the company considered light weight to be critical in making a well-performing car given the limited power of the engines then available. Most Franklins were wood-framed, though the very first used an angle iron frame (1902) and, beginning in 1928, the heavier cars adopted a conventional pressed-steel frame. Lightweight aluminum was used in quantity, to the extent that Franklin was reckoned to be the largest user of aluminum in the world in the early years of the company.

==Production==
Offerings for 1904 included a touring car model with a detachable rear &quot;tonneau&quot; and which seated four passengers. The transverse-mounted, vertical straight-four engine, producing 10 hp (7.5 kW), was mounted at the front of the car. A two-speed planetary transmission was fitted. The car weighed 1100 lb (499 kg). List price was US$1300. By contrast, the Ford Model F in 1905 was priced at $1,000, the FAL was US$1750, a Cole 30 or Colt Runabout was US$1500, the Ford Model S $700, the high-volume Oldsmobile Runabout US$650, Western&#x27;s Gale Model A US$500, the Black could be as low as $375, and the Success hit the amazingly low US$250.

Franklin cars were technological leaders, first with six cylinders (by 1905) and automatic spark advance, in 1907. Demonstrating reliability, L. L. Whitman drove a Franklin from New York City to San Francisco in 1906 in 15 days 2 hours 15 minutes, a new record. Franklin was the undisputed leader in air-cooled cars at a time when virtually every other manufacturer had adopted water cooling as cheaper and easier to manufacture. Before the invention of antifreeze, the air-cooled car had a huge advantage in cold weather, and Franklins were popular among people such as doctors, who needed an all-weather machine. The limitation of air-cooling was the size of the cylinder bore and the available area for the valves, which limited the power output of the earlier Franklins. By 1921, a change in cooling—moving the fan from sucking hot air to blowing cool air—led the way to the gradual increase in power.

Franklins were often rather odd-looking cars, although some were distinctly handsome with Renault-style hoods. Starting in 1925, at the demand of dealers, Franklins were redesigned to look like conventional cars sporting a massive nickel-plated &quot;dummy radiator&quot; which served as an air intake and was called a &quot;hoodfront&quot;. This design by J. Frank DeCausse enabled the Franklin to employ conventional styling. The same year, Franklin introduced the boat-tail to car design.

==Improved engine design==
In 1930 Franklin introduced a new type of engine which ultimately produced , with one of the highest power-to-weight ratios of the time. In 1932, in response to competition amongst luxury car makers, Franklin brought out a twelve-cylinder engine. Air cooled with 398 cubic inches (6.5 L), it developed 150 hp (110 kW). It was designed to be installed in a lightweight chassis, but the car became a behemoth when Franklin engineers were overruled by management sent in from banks to recover bad loans. Although attractive, the Twelve did not have the ride and handling characteristics of its forebears. This was the wrong vehicle to be building after the crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. The cars sold poorly and failed to recover the company&#x27;s investment. The company declared bankruptcy in 1934.

Car production did not survive, but the name and assets were sold. Production of air-cooled engines for commercial and aircraft use was continued by Aircooled Motors of Syracuse. This company was bought after World War II by Preston Tucker. The flat-six engines were fitted with water-cooling jackets and used in the short lived Tucker automobile. The company was sold again after Tucker was disbanded.

Franklin engines powered numerous light planes (owing to their light weight) as well as most early American-built helicopters. Aircooled Motors, the last company to manufacture air-cooled engines under the Franklin name, declared bankruptcy in 1975. Its designs were sold to the Polish government. Engines based on these designs remain in production.

==In retrospect==
In his book for the Society of Automotive Engineers Inc, &quot;The Franklin Automobile Company&quot;, Sinclair Powell gave the following reasons for the end of Franklin:

: While the cars were ranked among the industry&#x27;s top products and in some years more than half the sales were to previous Franklin owners on top of major economic forces there were difficulties from within the firm itself.
# Profit per vehicle was enough to pay a proper dividend in only one year, 1925
# Franklin held on to its &quot;craft shop&quot; approach whereas Packard and Cadillac moved on without any loss of quality
# Franklin went on making many components when they might have been bought in at a much lower cost
# Walker Body Company was chosen to supply aluminium bodies of high quality when (heavier) steel bodies were available at relatively low cost
# Franklin dealers might be in insignificant locations and in any case did not occupy the imposing establishments of Packard and Cadillac dealers

Debt taken on to greatly expand production in 1929 produced extra cars saleable only for very large discounts. This discounting seriously weakened both Franklin and its dealerships even before the onset of the Great Depression. Similar discounting to move unsold stock was repeated in 1930 and again in 1931 and Franklin&#x27;s position became hopeless. It struggled on until adjudged bankrupt in April 1934.

<text>In set theory, a branch of mathematics, a rank-into-rank embedding is a large cardinal property defined by one of the following four axioms given in order of increasing consistency strength. (A set of rank formula_1 is one of the elements of the set formula_2 of the von Neumann hierarchy.)

*Axiom I3: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_2 into itself.
*Axiom I2: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_4 into a transitive class formula_5 that includes formula_2 where formula_7 is the first fixed point above the critical point.
*Axiom I1: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_8 into itself.
*Axiom I0: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_9 into itself with critical point below formula_7.

These are essentially the strongest known large cardinal axioms not known to be inconsistent in ZFC; the axiom for Reinhardt cardinals is stronger, but is not consistent with the axiom of choice.

If formula_11 is the elementary embedding mentioned in one of these axioms and formula_12 is its critical point, then formula_7 is the limit of formula_14 as formula_15 goes to formula_16. More generally, if the axiom of choice holds, it is provable that if there is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_17 into itself then formula_18 is either a limit ordinal of cofinality formula_16 or the successor of such an ordinal.

The axioms I0, I1, I2, and I3 were at first suspected to be inconsistent (in ZFC) as it was thought possible that Kunen&#x27;s inconsistency theorem that Reinhardt cardinals are inconsistent with the axiom of choice could be extended to them, but this has not yet happened and they are now usually believed to be consistent.

Every I0 cardinal formula_12 (speaking here of the critical point of formula_11) is an I1 cardinal.

Every I1 cardinal formula_12 (sometimes called ω-huge cardinals) is an I2 cardinal and has a stationary set of I2 cardinals below it.

Every I2 cardinal formula_12 is an I3 cardinal and has a stationary set of I3 cardinals below it.

Every I3 cardinal formula_12 has another I3 cardinal &quot;above&quot; it and is an formula_15-huge cardinal for every formula_26.

Axiom I1 implies that formula_8 (equivalently, formula_28) does not satisfy V=HOD. There is no set formula_29 definable in formula_8 (even from parameters formula_2 and ordinals formula_32) with formula_33 cofinal in formula_7 and formula_35, that is, no such formula_33 witnesses that formula_7 is singular. And similarly for Axiom I0 and ordinal definability in formula_9 (even from parameters in formula_2). However globally, and even in formula_2, V=HOD is relatively consistent with Axiom I1.

Notice that I0 is sometimes strengthened further by adding an &quot;Icarus set&quot;, so that it would be
*Axiom Icarus set: There is a nontrivial elementary embedding of formula_41 into itself with the critical point below formula_7.
The Icarus set should be in formula_43 but chosen to avoid creating an inconsistency. So for example, it cannot encode a well-ordering of formula_8. See section 10 of Dimonte for more details.

Woodin defined a sequence of sets formula_45 for use as Icarus sets.

<doc id="311019" wikidata="Q4493344" url="?curid=311019" title="E. Fuller Torrey">
<text>Edwin Fuller Torrey (born September 6, 1937), is an American psychiatrist and schizophrenia researcher. He is associate director of research at the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) and founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), a nonprofit organization whose principal activity is promoting the passage and implementation of outpatient commitment laws and civil commitment laws and standards in individual states that allow people diagnosed with severe mental illness to be involuntarily hospitalized and treated throughout the United States.

Torrey has conducted numerous research studies, particularly on possible infectious causes of schizophrenia. He has become well known as an advocate of the idea that severe mental illness, psychosis, is due to biological factors and not social factors as may be found in neurotic illnesses. He has appeared on national radio and television outlets and written for many newspapers. He has received two Commendation Medals by the U.S. Public Health Service along with other awards and tributes. He has been criticized by a range of people, including federal researchers and others for some of his attacks on de-institutionalization and his support for forced medication as a method of treatment.

Torrey is on the board of the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), which describes itself as being &quot;a national nonprofit advocacy organization&quot;. TAC supports involuntary treatment when deemed appropriate by a judge (at the urging of the person&#x27;s psychiatrist and family members). Torrey has written several books on mental illness, including &quot;Surviving Schizophrenia&quot;. He is a distant relative of abolitionist Charles Turner Torrey and has written his biography.

==Education and early career==
Torrey earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Princeton University, and his M.D. from the McGill University Faculty of Medicine. Torrey also earned a master&#x27;s degree in anthropology from Stanford University, and was trained in psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. At McGill and later at Stanford, he was exposed to a biological approach and recalls that one of his first-year instructors at McGill was Heinz Lehmann, the first clinician in North America to use the first neuroleptic medication, chlorpromazine.

Torrey practiced general medicine in Ethiopia for two years as a Peace Corps physician followed by practiced in the South Bronx, US. From 1970 to 1975, he was a special administrative assistant to the National Institute of Mental Health director. He then worked for a year in Alaska in the Indian Health Service. He became a ward physician at St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C. for nine years, where he reportedly worked with the most challenging patients and aimed to avoid the use of seclusion or restraints on the acute admission units. He also volunteered at Washington, D.C. homeless clinics.

==Stanley Medical Research Institute==
Torrey is the founder and executive director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI), a large, private entity for conducting research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the U.S. SMRI also maintains a collection of postmortem brain tissue from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression and from unaffected controls, which are made available to researchers without charge.

After reading Torrey&#x27;s book &quot;Surviving Schizophrenia&quot;, Theodore Stanley, a businessman who had made a fortune in direct-mail marketing and whose son had been diagnosed in the late 1980s with bipolar disorder, contacted Torrey and he and his wife provided the funds for the new institute.

 the Stanley Institute had 30 employees and funded half of all U.S. research on bipolar disorder and about a quarter of all schizophrenia research. In 2003 the institute&#x27;s research budget was around $40 million, 74 percent of which was given out to other researchers through grants. As of 2008 SMRI reported that 75% of its expenditure goes towards the development of new treatments.

The Stanley Medical Institute in Bethesda, Maryland has collected around 600 brains as of 2008

The SMRI has been sued for allegedly taking brains for use in research without proper consent. One lawsuit was settled out of court.

SMRI reports that it has a close relationship with and is the supporting organization for the Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC).

==Treatment Advocacy Center==
Torrey is a founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a national organization that supports outpatient commitment for certain people with mental illness who, in his view of their treatment history and present circumstances, are judged unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision. TAC has been credited by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and others with helping pass Kendra&#x27;s Law in the state. Kendra&#x27;s Law allows court-ordered involuntary treatment of people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness who have a history of not following psychiatric advice, i.e., individuals who are, &quot;as a result of his or her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan.&quot; Previously, only inpatient programs were available to submit a person to involuntary treatment. TAC&#x27;s efforts to pass Kendra&#x27;s Law led to similar successful passage of Laura&#x27;s Law in California, and similar laws in Florida and elsewhere.

==National Alliance on Mental Illness==
Torrey was for many years an active advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt that he spoke up for them when much of the medical establishment had previously held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the hardcover royalties from the sale of his book &quot;Surviving Schizophrenia&quot;.

Although Torrey, TAC, and NAMI remain aligned, NAMI may have tried to distance itself from TAC in 1998. One source &quot;The Psychiatric Times&quot;, reported that TAC was designed from the start to be &quot;a separate support organization with its own source of funding.&quot; According to MindFreedom International, an association of survivors of psychiatric treatment opposed to involuntary treatment, NAMI severed its relationship with TAC because of pressure from groups opposed to Torrey both from within NAMI and outside NAMI. Torrey is, according to MindFreedom, one of &quot;the most feverishly pro-force psychiatrists in the world&quot;. MindFreedom suggests that the &quot;links between NAMI and TAC are simply going from overt to covert.&quot;

In 2002, NAMI&#x27;s Executive Director issued a statement highly critical of 60 Minutes for producing a piece entitled &quot;Dr. Torrey&#x27;s War.&quot; In the statement, NAMI alternately criticized and backed various positions espoused by Torrey while aiming its criticism at 60 Minutes for what NAMI called &quot;sound bite journalism.&quot;

Torrey was also the keynote speaker at the 23rd annual NAMI convention in 2002.

In 2005, NAMI gave Torrey a tribute on its 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall, for those who have donated over $25,000. It called him a groundbreaking researcher, a ferociously resolute advocate, a prominent and admired author of dozens of books and a dedicated practicing clinician, and said that he had &quot;touched the lives of countless NAMI members throughout this nation.&quot;

NAMI has some continuing links to TAC via their board of directors. Frederick Frese, a psychologist who died in 2018, was on both the NAMI and TAC boards. TAC has two other former NAMI board members on their board and Laurie Flynn, the former NAMI executive director, is part of the TAC Honorary Advisory Committee.

In 2008, Torrey disagreed with a NAMI view on second-generation antipsychotics and accused the medical director and executive director of failing to disclose conflicts of interest, because they are employees of an organization that receives more than half its budget from pharmaceutical companies. He argued they were not representing the views of many members of NAMI including himself.

==Scientific research and views==
In the 1950s, it was commonly thought that schizophrenia was caused by bad parenting. Torrey has argued that this theory had a toxic effect on parents. His sister had severe schizophrenia and spent most of five decades in hospitals and nursing homes until her death.

Torrey has been a fierce opponent of the influence of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. He has also argued that psychiatry should focus only on severe mental illness, conceived as neurological disorders, rather than other mental issues that he viewed as non-medical.

Torrey was principal investigator of a NIMH Schizophrenia/Bipolar Disorder Twin Study conducted at the Neuroscience center of St Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and copublished more than a dozen studies on structural brain differences between affected and unaffected siblings. He differed from his collaborators in arguing that the genetic heritability of schizophrenia was lower than typically estimated. A review of Torrey&#x27;s data analysis, however, suggested he had erroneously compared different sorts of concordance statistics.

In the early 1970s, Torrey became interested in viral infections as possible causes of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, particularly a parasite &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; whose definitive host is the cat, but whose intermediate host can be any mammal, including humans. Up to one third of the world&#x27;s human population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection. Since then he has published, often with Robert Yolken, more than 30 articles on seasonal variation and possible infectious causes of schizophrenia, focusing especially on Toxoplasma gondii. He is involved in five or six ongoing studies using anti-Toxoplasmosa gondii agents (e.g. antibiotics such as minocycline and azithromycin) as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia. He believes that infectious causes will eventually explain the &quot;vast majority&quot; of schizophrenia cases. Some of his collaborators have disagreed with the emphasis he has placed on infection as a direct causal factor. Many of the research studies on links between schizophrenia and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;, by different authors in different countries, are funded and supported by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. The hypothesis is not prominent in current mainstream scientific views on the causes of schizophrenia, although infections may be seen as one possible risk factor that could lead to vulnerabilities in early neurodevelopment in some cases. Torrey hopes to live long enough to see vaccines to prevent many or most cases of schizophrenia.

Torrey has generally been in favor of antipsychotic drugs. He has claimed that taking antipsychotics reduces the risk of violence, homelessness and prison. He has argued that &quot;noncompliance&quot; in about half of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is due to lack of &quot;insight&quot; into the illness because the part of the brain for self-awareness has been affected; and that in some who are aware it is due to adverse effects ranging from tremors or sedation to sexual dysfunction to substantial weight gain. He has also reported that at least some antipsychotics cause medical conditions that can be fatal in some people, especially African Americans. He has also argued that pharmaceutical companies have too much influence over psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists, effectively buying them off.

Torrey has advocated in favor of a flexible well-funded range of community mental health services, including Assertive Community Treatment, clubhouses (staffed by professionals with consumers as members), supported housing and supported employment, emphasizing illness and medication compliance throughout. However, he has criticized community alternatives which do not enforce drug treatment, such as those espoused by many psychiatric survivors and the National Empowerment Center.

==Recognition==
Torrey has appeared on national radio and television (outlets like NPR, Oprah, 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Dateline) and has written for many newspapers. He has received a 1984 Special Families Award from NAMI, two Commendation Medals from the U.S. Public Health Service, a 1991 National Caring Award, and a humanitarian award from NARSAD (now known as the Brain &amp; Behavior Research Foundation). In 1999, he received a research award from the International Congress of Schizophrenia. In 2005, a tribute to Torrey was included in NAMI&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Celebratory Donor Wall.

==Criticism==

Torrey has criticized many organizations. He has charged the National Institute of Mental Health with not concentrating its resources sufficiently on severe mental illness and directly applicable research; NIMH has disputed his statistics and viewpoint.

Experts such as Dr. Peter C. Gøtzsche, Dr. Jorun Rugkåsa, James Gottstein, and others have called into question both the evidence basis and ethics of coercive practices such as court-ordered treatment, citing substantial scientific literature and patient testimony showing harm and/or lack of benefit. The United Nations and its World Health Organization have repeatedly called for the end to coercive interventions in psychiatry, naming them as human rights violations traumatizing significant portions of those affected; instead, they suggest community-based alternatives without threat of force.

Torrey has been charged with acting to limit the voice of those consumers, survivors and ex-patients that he disagrees with, opposing their civil rights and censoring and ridiculing their ideas and those of their supporters. Torrey has been a long-time critic of the Center for Mental Health Services that provides support and advocacy, on the grounds that they support anti-psychiatry groups and those opposed to outpatient commitment, claiming they neglect the seriously mentally ill due to a hippie &#x27;60s attitude, distribute funds on the basis of other factors such as &quot;community cohesion&quot; and ethnic minority involvement, and are more dysfunctional than the individuals they are supposed to help. He has specifically opposed public funding for the National Empowerment Center, for rejecting the medical model and arguing for a recovery model without necessarily needing medication; it has since lost its funding from the CMHS. Torrey has in general been instrumental in lobbying against, and undermining, community-based consumer projects because they promoted social and experiential recovery and questioned the standard medical model. Consumer organizations have protested that they are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to political whim while Torrey and his organizations have rich and powerful backers. It has been argued that Torrey and other psychiatric and family member advocates do not necessarily have the same interests as consumers/survivors themselves. Differences in ideology sharpened after the development of NAMI. 

In criticizing the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health for not recommending forced outpatient medicating, Torrey claimed that stigma against people with mental disorders was largely due to them committing violent acts due to not taking medication. He called the recovery model harmful for sending a cruel message of hope, or implicit blame, to those he believes cannot engage in a recovery process, despite being a laudable long-term vision for the commission. However, there is no current evidence that forcing psychiatric drug compliance reduces risk of crime. Furthermore, evidence suggests that using antipsychotic medication may not reduce risk of homicide, and use of other popular psychiatric drugs may increase risk (based on causal inference after controlling for confounding factors related to taking medication). 

Although Torrey described family members as &quot;surviving schizophrenia&quot; in his book of that title, in 1997 he said the term &quot;psychiatric survivor&quot; used by ex-patients to describe themselves was just political correctness and he blamed them, along with civil rights lawyers, for the deaths of half a million people due to suicides and deaths on the street. His comments elicited a record number of letters in response, some in favour of Torrey but most against. The accusations have been described as inflammatory and completely unsubstantiated, and issues of self-determination and self-identity said to be more complex than Torrey realizes. In the same journal in 1999, Torrey and Miller of the Stanley Foundation Research Program argued for an incentivised schizophrenia treatment system backed by a credible threat of force, modeled on that used for the fatal infectious disease tuberculosis; replies criticized the logic of the analogy and resort to forced drugging rather than developing alliances and understanding, to which Torrey accused the director and members of MindFreedom International of living off federal funds while denying illness and not caring about the mentally ill on the streets and in prisons. 

Torrey has been a vocal critic of the failures of deinstitutionalization and inadequate community mental health services. He has generally linked this to issues of violence, homelessness and medication noncompliance, as well as lack of proper focus by the relevant governmental organizations. He has been accused of gaining influence by sensationalizing and exaggerating the incidence of violence and its link to medication noncompliance, including disseminating unsubstantiated and unreliable statistics. When a California NAMI journal editor included a questioning of Torrey&#x27;s statistics, the local board glued together the pages and effectively shut down the journal. Others, while agreeing that public mental health care in the U.S. falls far short of what people with serious psychiatric disorders need and deserve, have argued that Torrey&#x27;s solutions are outdated and that his book &quot;The Insanity Offense&quot; is based on unsubstantiated portrayals of certainty on the statistics on violence, outpatient commitment and medication, stigmatizing tens of thousands of people, deeply offending and insulting those who hold views differing from his own, and promulgating one-dimensional solutions. TAC&#x27;s attempts to associate violent incidents in the news with lack of medication have been described as wild hyperbole, and the use of the term &quot;assisted treatment&quot; has been described as a euphemism for forced drugging.

Torrey has been criticized by, and has criticized, Thomas Szasz, a libertarian psychiatrist and author of &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; (1961), who is opposed to involuntary treatment. Torrey has said he admires Szasz for his outspoken criticisms of many psychiatric practices, including &quot;diagnostic creep&quot; (disease mongering) and the potential for the political abuse of psychiatric labels, but he has criticized Szasz for asserting that schizophrenia is not an organic disease of the brain like, for example, Parkinson&#x27;s disease or multiple sclerosis.

<text>William Lee Currie (born 1 April 1950) is a British multi-instrumentalist and songwriter from Huddersfield, England. He is best known as the keyboard and strings player with new wave band Ultravox, who achieved their greatest commercial success in the 1980s.
==Biography==
Currie was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire and had an interest in music from an early age. As a child he sang a lot and at the age of ten he got a guitar. In 1961 he picked up the violin at school and also sang in a choir. A year later he was in the school orchestra, but had to change instrument to viola to get a place at the Huddersfield School of Music, which he joined in 1965. The education was a preparation to become an orchestral player, learning viola with piano as his second instrument and also studying composition and harmony. During this time he joined a string quartet, played viola in an orchestra and performed with a viola, clarinet and piano trio. At this time Currie was excited to discover composers like Béla Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Honegger and Edgar Varese. By 1967 he became increasingly interested in rock music, excited by the fact that bands created something unique and original together. In 1969 he had qualified for a place at the Royal Academy of Music in London for further education, but decided not to go. Currie was interested in breaking into other areas of music and joined a rock band instead, playing viola. In the early 1970s he was a member of the experimental art group The Ritual Theatre, which included four classically trained musicians and four dancers. With this group Currie performed in Holland, Edinburgh Festival and various other places.

In 1974, Currie left Ritual Theatre to join the glam rock band Tiger Lily on viola and keyboard. In 1976, after several name changes, the band ultimately became Ultravox and recorded three albums, &quot;Ultravox!&quot;, &quot;Ha!-Ha!-Ha!&quot; and &quot;Systems of Romance&quot;, before singer John Foxx left to pursue a solo career in March 1979.

During Ultravox&#x27;s subsequent hiatus, Currie dedicated himself to different projects. He collaborated with Gary Numan who had admired the &quot;Systems of Romance&quot; album and asked Currie to record some songs that were included on his first solo album, &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. Currie toured with Numan&#x27;s band during 1979. During soundchecks for the tour Currie, with Gary Numan band musicians Chris Payne and Cedric Sharpley began to develop a song of their own called &quot;Toot City&quot;. Currie had also joined the studio-based band Visage, fronted by Steve Strange, that also included Midge Ure. Currie and Ure developed a solid working relationship. Visage drummer Rusty Egan encouraged Currie to ask Ure to join the defunct Ultravox as lead singer/guitarist. Whilst composing material for a new Ultravox album and for the debut Visage album, Ure collaborated with Currie on the &quot;Toot City&quot; track which eventually became &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;. The single became a huge hit for Visage in early 1981. However, this was surpassed by Ultravox&#x27;s hit &quot;Vienna&quot;, released around the same time. Both Ultravox and Visage became highly successful recording acts in the early 1980s. Ure decided to leave Visage to focus on Ultravox full-time in 1982. Currie remained with Visage for a while longer, but he too had left by 1984.

From 1980 to 1986, Ultravox released seven top 10 albums, including a live album and a &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilation and featured in Live Aid in Wembley Stadium on 13 July 1985. During the last days of the band, there were tensions between Currie and Ure. With an underwhelming response to their 1986 album &quot;U-Vox&quot;, the band effectively disintegrated.

In 1988, Currie put out an instrumental solo album &quot;Transportation&quot;, released on the IRS NoSpeak record label. Steve Howe played guitar on some of the tracks, with Currie later playing keyboards in Howe&#x27;s 1991 album Turbulence. In 1989 he formed the band Humania. An album by them called &quot;Sinews of Soul&quot; was released in 2005.

In 1992, Currie reformed Ultravox with a new line-up (himself being the only original member involved). With Tony Fennell on vocals, they recorded the album &quot;Revelation&quot;. At the outset of the subsequent tour, Fennell left to be replaced by Sam Blue. The tour took in the former USSR and Malta amongst other locations. Many of the synthesisers for which Currie was famous, apart from the often-volatile OSCar and Minimoog, were abandoned for this tour, replaced with Korg Wavestations and T-series keyboards. A further Ultravox album featuring this line-up, &quot;Ingenuity&quot;, was released in 1994. Both albums were commercially unsuccessful.

Since 2001 Billy Currie has released several solo albums on his own label. These include &quot;Unearthed&quot;, completed in 1998, and &quot;Keys and the Fiddle&quot;, which includes Curries soundtrack to the short film &quot;The Fragile Skin&quot; (1999), new material and a previously unreleased 1983 collaboration with Steve Howe and Hazel O&#x27;Connor.

In 2009 and 2010, the &quot;classic&quot; Ultravox line-up from the 1980s (Currie, Ure, Chris Cross, and Warren Cann) reformed for two successful tours – their first together in over twenty years. In 2016 Currie announced his retirement from Ultravox. In May 2016 he released his 10th solo album &quot;Doppel&quot;.

==Instruments==
Currie is noted for his use of analogue synthesisers, such as the Elka Rhapsody, and in particular his trademark soloing sound, which typically consisted of soaring fluid lines on an ARP Odyssey, making use of oscillator sync, later re-created with the Oxford Synthesiser Company OSCar synth. Currie&#x27;s original instrument whilst at music college was the viola, and he frequently added solo violin or viola to the arrangements of songs he played on, a relatively unusual choice in pop music.
At the height of Ultravox&#x27;s career, Billy Currie&#x27;s keyboard rig included a Yamaha CP70 electric piano and SS30 string machine, CS80 synthesiser, a PPG Wave 2.2 digital synth, a Sequential Circuits Prophet T8 synth as well as his trademark ARP Odyssey. Other synths used by Ultravox included the Moog MiniMoog, Yamaha GS1 (the pad sound on &quot;Lament&quot;) and Emulator II sampler.

==Personal life==
Currie is married to Heidi (his 2nd wife) and has a son named Tom and a daughter named Lucy. He lives in North London.

<doc id="311024" wikidata="Q1188688" url="?curid=311024" title="Peace of Vervins">
<text>The Peace of Vervins or Treaty of Vervins was signed between the representatives of Henry IV of France and Philip II of Spain under the auspices of the papal legates of Clement VIII, on 2 May 1598 at the small town of Vervins in Picardy, northern France, close to the territory of the Habsburg Netherlands.

==Background==
Henry had declared war on Spain in 1595 and after victory at the Siege of Amiens in 1597, he then promulgated the Edict of Nantes, on 13 April the following year. The Edict effectively brought the Wars of Religion in France including the Brittany Campaign to an end, which had spread to a European-wide conflict.

==Treaty==
The parties to the treaty were hosted by Guillemette de Coucy, co-seigneur of Vervins, in her Châteauneuf de Vervins (&quot;fr&quot;) Close to the Spanish Netherlands, the Thiérache region had suffered much damage in the recent fighting. Its numerous 16th-century fortified churches still bear witness today.

The terms were worked out under the auspices of the papal legate of Clement VIII, Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, the &quot;architect of the treaty&quot;, according to Bernard Barbiche.

By its terms, Philip recognized the formerly Protestant Henry as King of France and withdrew his forces from French territory, depriving the remnants of the faltering Catholic League of their support. Additionally, the vitally important city of Calais and the coastal fortress of Risban, which had been captured by the Spaniards in 1596, were returned to the French.

==Aftermath==
Philip died on 13 September, but his heir Philip III respected the terms of the treaty. Carlo Emanuele, duke of Savoy, who had held back from the treaty, was defeated by Henry IV in 1599. He signed a separate Treaty of Lyon with Henry in 1601.

Some historians have seen this as the final defeat of Philip II, who had furthered dynastic causes through championing ultra-Catholic principles, and a sign of the long downfall of Habsburg Spain and the gradual rise in European hegemony of France during the ensuing &quot;Grand Siècle&quot;.

<doc id="311034" wikidata="Q159430" url="?curid=311034" title="Arthur Cayley">
<text>Arthur Cayley (; 16 August 1821 – 26 January 1895) was a British mathematician who worked mostly on algebra. He helped found the modern British school of pure mathematics, and was a professor at Trinity College, Cambridge for 35 years.

He postulated what is now known as the Cayley–Hamilton theorem—that every square matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial, and verified it for matrices of order 2 and 3. He was the first to define the concept of an abstract group, a set with a binary operation satisfying certain laws, as opposed to Évariste Galois&#x27; concept of permutation groups. In group theory, Cayley tables, Cayley graphs, and Cayley&#x27;s theorem are named in his honour, as well as Cayley&#x27;s formula in combinatorics.

==Early life==
Arthur Cayley was born in Richmond, London, England, on 16 August 1821. His father, Henry Cayley, was a distant cousin of George Cayley, the aeronautics engineer innovator, and descended from an ancient Yorkshire family. He settled in Saint Petersburg, Russia, as a merchant. His mother was Maria Antonia Doughty, daughter of William Doughty. According to some writers she was Russian, but her father&#x27;s name indicates an English origin. His brother was the linguist Charles Bagot Cayley. Arthur spent his first eight years in Saint Petersburg. In 1829 his parents were settled permanently at Blackheath, London, where Arthur attended a private school. 

At age 14, he was sent to King&#x27;s College School. The young Cayley enjoyed complex maths problems, and the school&#x27;s master observed indications of his mathematical genius. He advised the father to educate his son not for his own business, as he had intended, but at the University of Cambridge.

==Education==
At the age of 17 Cayley began residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in Greek, French, German, and Italian, as well as mathematics. The cause of the Analytical Society had now triumphed, and the &quot;Cambridge Mathematical Journal&quot; had been instituted by Gregory and Robert Leslie Ellis. To this journal, at the age of twenty, Cayley contributed three papers, on subjects that had been suggested by reading the &quot;Mécanique analytique&quot; of Joseph Louis Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace.

Cayley&#x27;s tutor at Cambridge was George Peacock and his private coach was William Hopkins. He finished his undergraduate course by winning the place of Senior Wrangler, and the first Smith&#x27;s prize. His next step was to take the M.A. degree, and win a Fellowship by competitive examination. He continued to reside at Cambridge University for four years; during which time he took some pupils, but his main work was the preparation of 28 memoirs to the &quot; Mathematical Journal&quot;.

==Law career==
Because of the limited tenure of his fellowship it was necessary to choose a profession; like De Morgan, Cayley chose law, and was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London on 20 April 1846 at the age of 24. He made a specialty of conveyancing. It was while he was a pupil at the bar examination that he went to Dublin to hear William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s lectures on quaternions.

His friend J. J. Sylvester, his senior by five years at Cambridge, was then an actuary, resident in London; they used to walk together round the courts of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, discussing the theory of invariants and covariants. During these fourteen years, Cayley produced between two and three hundred papers.

==Professorship==
Around 1860, Cambridge University&#x27;s Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (Newton&#x27;s chair) was supplemented by the new Sadleirian professorship, using funds bequeathed by Lady Sadleir, with the 42-year-old Cayley as its first holder. His duties were &quot;to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics and to apply himself to the advancement of that science.&quot; He gave up a lucrative legal practice for a modest salary, but never regretted the exchange, since it allowed him to devote his energies to the pursuit that he liked best. He at once married and settled down in Cambridge, and (unlike Hamilton) enjoyed a home life of great happiness. Sylvester, his friend from his bachelor days, once expressed his envy of Cayley&#x27;s peaceful family life, whereas the unmarried Sylvester had to fight the world all his days.

At first the Sadleirian professor was paid to lecture over one of the terms of the academic year, but the university financial reform of 1886 freed funds to extend his lectures to two terms. For many years his courses were attended only by a few students who had finished their examination preparation, but after the reform the attendance numbered about fifteen. He generally lectured on his current research topic.

As for his duty to the advancement of mathematical science, he published a long and fruitful series of memoirs ranging over all of pure mathematics. He also became the standing referee on the merits of mathematical papers to many societies both at home and abroad.

In 1872, he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, and three years later an ordinary fellow, a paid position. About this time his friends subscribed for a presentation portrait. Maxwell wrote an address praising Cayley&#x27;s principal works, including his Chapters on the Analytical Geometry of formula_1 dimensions; On the theory of Determinants; Memoir on the theory of Matrices; Memoirs on skew surfaces, otherwise Scrolls; and On the delineation of a Cubic Scroll.

In addition to his work on algebra, Cayley made fundamental contributions to algebraic geometry. Cayley and Salmon discovered the 27 lines on a cubic surface. Cayley constructed the Chow variety of all curves in projective 3-space. He founded the algebro-geometric theory of ruled surfaces. His contributions to combinatorics include counting the &quot;nn&quot;–2 trees on &quot;n&quot; labeled vertices by the pioneering use of generating functions.

In 1876, he published a &quot;Treatise on Elliptic Functions&quot;. He took great interest in the movement for the university education of women. At Cambridge the first women&#x27;s colleges were Girton and Newnham. In the early days of Girton College he gave direct help in teaching, and for some years he was chairman of the council of Newnham College, in the progress of which he took the keenest interest to the last.

In 1881, he received from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where Sylvester was then professor of mathematics, an invitation to deliver a course of lectures. He accepted the invitation, and lectured at Baltimore during the first five months of 1882 on the subject of the &quot;Abelian and Theta Functions&quot;.

In 1893, Cayley became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==British Association presidency==
In 1883, Cayley was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The meeting was held at Southport, in the north of England. As the President&#x27;s address is one of the great popular events of the meeting, and brings out an audience of general culture, it is usually made as little technical as possible. took for his subject the Progress of Pure Mathematics.

==The &quot;Collected Papers&quot;==
In 1889, the Cambridge University Press began the publication of his collected papers, which he appreciated very much. He edited seven of the quarto volumes himself, though suffering from a painful internal malady. He died 26 January 1895 at age 73. His funeral at Trinity Chapel was attended by the leading scientists of Britain, with official representatives from as far as Russia and America.

The remainder of his papers were edited by Andrew Forsyth, his successor as Sadleirian professor, in total thirteen quarto volumes and 967 papers. His work continues in frequent use, cited in more than 200 mathematical papers in the 21st century alone.

Cayley retained to the last his fondness for novel-reading and for travelling. He also took special pleasure in paintings and architecture, and he practiced water-colour painting, which he found useful sometimes in making mathematical diagrams.

==Legacy==
Cayley is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge.

An 1874 portrait of Cayley by Lowes Cato Dickinson and an 1884 portrait by William Longmaid are in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.

<doc id="311037" wikidata="Q888270" url="?curid=311037" title="Bob Stump">
<text>Robert Lee Stump (April 4, 1927 – June 20, 2003) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Congressman from Arizona. He served as a member from the Democratic Party from 1977 to 1983 and then later a member of the Republican Party until the end of his tenure as congressman.

==Early life and career==
Stump was born in Phoenix, and was a U.S. Navy World War II combat veteran, where he served on the USS &quot;Tulagi&quot; from 1943 to 1946. He graduated from Tolleson Union High School in 1947, and Arizona State University in 1951 where he was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He owned a cotton and grain farm in the Phoenix suburb of Tolleson for many years.

He served four terms in the Arizona House of Representatives from 1959 to 1967, and five terms in the Arizona State Senate, from 1967 to 1976. He served as President of the Arizona State Senate from 1975 to 1976.

==Member of Congress==
He was first elected to the 95th Congress on November 2, 1976, originally as a Democrat from the 3rd Congressional District, a vast district stretching from western Phoenix through Prescott to Lake Havasu City and the Grand Canyon. He defeated state senate minority leader Fred Koory with 47 percent of the vote.

Stump wore his party ties very loosely. He considered himself a &quot;Pinto Democrat,&quot; the popular name for conservative Democrats from rural Arizona, and his voting record was strongly conservative. His profile was similar to those of conservative Democrats from the South. He voted for Ronald Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts in 1981. Shortly after that vote, he announced he would become a Republican when Congress reconvened in January 1982. Regardless of his party affiliation, he never faced serious competition at the ballot box. After his initial run for Congress, he only dropped below 60 percent of the vote once, in 1990. He only faced an independent in 1978, and was completely unopposed in 1986.

He briefly considered running for the Senate in 1986 after Barry Goldwater decided to retire.

Described as &quot;quiet&quot; and &quot;assiduously private&quot;, Stump kept a fairly low profile for most of his tenure. He had only a skeleton staff; he was known to answer the phone himself at his Washington, D.C. office, and to open his own mail. Stump usually returned home to work his farm in Tolleson on weekends.

In November 1997, Stump was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Stump voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Stump voted in favor of all four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted).

In his 26 years in the House he became a noted member of the House Armed Services Committee, serving as chairman from 2001 to 2003. He&#x27;d chaired the House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee from 1995 to 2001, when he was forced to give that post up due to caucus-imposed term limits. He is one of the few members of the House to chair both committees. He consistently supported increased spending on the military and veterans. The 2003 military appropriations authorization act was named after him in recognition of his commitment to the military as the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003.

Stump sponsored bills to make English the official language for government business and to alter laws so that children born on US soil to non-citizen parents would not automatically be citizens. According to Amy Silverson, he was &quot;best known in Congress as a perpetual naysayer, casting votes against almost all spending programs.&quot;

Between 1976 and 2002, he accumulated a lifetime score of 97 (out of 100) from the American Conservative Union. He received very low scores from the National Council of Senior Citizens, the American Civil Liberties Union, the AFL–CIO, the NAACP, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Although his district included the entire northwestern portion of Arizona, the great majority of its residents lived in the West Valley. Stump was often accused of addressing himself mainly to the West Valley and ignoring the other portions of his sprawling district, even though the district&#x27;s center of gravity had moved to the West Valley as early as the 1970s. Indeed, many of his constituents rarely saw him. He maintained his district office in downtown Phoenix, outside his own district, for many years. Although he claimed his farm in Tolleson as his residence in the district, his main residence was in another portion of Phoenix outside the district. However, Stump told &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; that he saw the farm as &quot;my place of business,&quot; and knew that &quot;nobody ever thought I resided there.&quot; He believed that &quot;you declare your residency wherever you want. Stump would have been well within his rights to claim his Phoenix home as his official residence, as members of the House are only required to live in the &quot;state&quot; they represent.

==Bob Hope announcement==
After the Associated Press mistakenly placed Bob Hope&#x27;s obituary on its web site in June 1998, Stump announced on the floor of the House that the entertainer had died. This was quickly denied by his daughter and publicist; Hope outlived Stump by five weeks, dying in 2003 at the age of 100.

==Death and legacy==
He decided not to run for re-election in 2002 due to declining health. He endorsed his longtime chief of staff, Lisa Jackson Atkins, as his successor in what was then numbered as the 2nd District. Atkins had been very visible in the district, to the point that many thought &quot;she&quot; actually represented it rather than Stump. However, Atkins was defeated in a seven way Republican primary by Trent Franks, who held the seat
until December 2017. Stump died June 20, 2003, of myelodysplasia, a blood disorder and was buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary &amp; Cemetery in Phoenix with full military honors.

In 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Prescott, Arizona, was renamed the Bob Stump Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Stump is no relation to the member of the Arizona Corporation Commission of the same name. In 2006, SR 303L was renamed the Bob Stump Memorial Highway.

In 2018, Stump&#x27;s widow issued a letter, criticizing an Arizona state government politician of the same name for allegedly capitalizing on her late husband&#x27;s name. The letter was met with a sharp rebuke by the state government politician&#x27;s mother.

<text>This article presents a possible chronological listing of the composition of the [[Shakespeare&#x27;s plays|plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]].

Shakespearean scholars, beginning with Edmond Malone in 1778, have attempted to reconstruct the relative chronology of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; by various means, using external evidence (such as references to the plays by Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries in both critical material and private documents, allusions in other plays, entries in the Stationers&#x27; Register, and records of performance and publication), and internal evidence (allusions within the plays to contemporary events, composition and publication dates of sources used by Shakespeare, stylistic analysis looking at the development of his style and diction over time, and the plays&#x27; context in the contemporary theatrical and literary &quot;milieu&quot;). Most modern chronologies are based on the work of E. K. Chambers in &quot;The Problem of Chronology&quot; (1930), published in Volume 1 of his book &quot;William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems&quot;.

== Introduction ==
Since the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, nor can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first &quot;recorded&quot; performances of many plays were not necessarily when the plays were first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was not until 1662, yet it is known the play was performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime. At best, the performance history of a play establishes only the &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of its composition.

Similarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, in the &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), prepared by John Heminges and Henry Condell, and published by Edward Blount, William Jaggard and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594; &quot;Othello&quot; was performed in 1604, but not published until 1622; and &quot;King Lear&quot; was performed in 1606, but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining much more speculative.

In addition, some scholars dissent from the conventional dating system altogether. A notable scholar who does so is E. A. J. Honigmann, who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare&#x27;s career by four or five years, to the mid-1580s, with his &quot;early start&quot; theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; in 1586, though the conventional dating is that Shakespeare began writing plays after arriving in London in about 1590. Most scholars, however, adhere to a more orthodox chronology, and some, such as Gary Taylor and Sidney Thomas, argue that the early start theory causes more problems than it solves.

== Scholarship ==

The chronology presented by E. K. Chambers in 1930 is as follows:

* &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; (1591–1592)
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; (1591–1592)
* &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; (1591–1592)

* &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1595–1596)
* &quot;King John&quot; (1596–1597)
* &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1596–1597)
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (1597–1598)
* &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (1597–1598)
* &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1598–1599)
* &quot;Henry V&quot; (1598–1599)
* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1599–1600)
* &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1599–1600)
* &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1599–1600)
* &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1600–1601)
* &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1600–1601)
* &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1601–1602)
* &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (1602–1603)
* &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1604–1605)
* &quot;Othello&quot; (1604–1605)
* &quot;King Lear&quot; (1605–1606)
* &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1605–1606)
* &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1606–1607)
* &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1607–1608)
* &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1607–1608)
* &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; (1608–1609)
* &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (1609–1610)
* &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1610–1611)
* &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1611–1612)
* &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1612–1613)
* &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; (1612–1613)
=== Modern &quot;Complete Works&quot; ===
There are six major modern scholarly editions of the &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot;:
* &quot;The Riverside Shakespeare&quot; (edited by G. Blakemore Evans in 1974, with a second edition in 1996)
* &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works&quot; (edited by Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett and William Montgomery in 1986, with a second edition in 2005)
* &quot;The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition&quot; (edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean E. Howard and Katharine Eisaman Maus in 1997, with a second edition in 2008 and a third in 2015)
* &quot;The Arden Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; (edited by Richard Proudfoot, Ann Thompson and David Scott Kastan in 1998, with a second edition in 2002 and a third in 2011)
* &quot;The Complete Pelican Shakespeare&quot; (edited by Stephen Orgel and A. R. Braunmuller in 2002)
* &quot;The RSC Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; (edited by Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen in 2007).

Additionally, as with Oxford, Arden, Pelican and the RSC, the New Cambridge Shakespeare, the New Penguin Shakespeare, the Signet Classic Shakespeare, the Dover Wilson Shakespeare, the Shakespeare Folios and the Folger Shakespeare Library all publish scholarly editions of individual plays, although none has issued a complete works.

&quot;The Arden Shakespeare&quot; presents the plays in alphabetical order of their titles, without any attempt to construct an overall chronology. The Oxford, Riverside, Norton and RSC collections each rely on chronologies that differ from one another and attempt only approximate dating. The following list is based on &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works&quot; (2nd ed.) and the accompanying &quot;William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion&quot; (Revised ed.), edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor.

== Chronology ==

=== &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1587–1591) ===

:First official record: in Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), referred to as &quot;&quot;Gentlemen of Verona&quot;.&quot;
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: an adaptation by Benjamin Victor was performed at Drury Lane in 1762. The earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Covent Garden on 15 April 1784, although because of the reference to the play in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, we know it was definitely performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime.
:Evidence: Stanley Wells argues that the play&#x27;s &quot;dramatic structure is comparatively unambitious, and while some of its scenes are expertly constructed, those involving more than, at the most, four characters betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience.&quot; The play is therefore considered one of the first Shakespeare composed after his arrival in London &quot;c.&quot;1590, at which point he would have lacked theatrical experience. Furthermore, the discussion between Launce and Speed regarding the vices and virtues of Launce&#x27;s mistress (3.1.276–359) seems to borrow from John Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Midas&quot;, which was written in late 1588 and/or early 1589, thus fixing a &quot;terminus post quem&quot; for the play. This situates the date of composition as somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known Shakespeare was working on the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays. In his 2008 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren, following E. A. J. Honigmann, suggests Shakespeare may have written the play before he arrived in London, possibly as early as 1587, although he acknowledges this theory is purely speculative.

=== &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1591–1592) ===

:First official record: possible version of the play entered into Stationers&#x27; Register by Peter Short on 2 May 1594 as &quot;a booke intituled A plesant Conceyted historie called the Tayminge of a Shrowe.&quot; The first record of the play as it exists today is found in the &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First published: possible version of the play published in quarto in 1594 as &quot;A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called The taming of a Shrew&quot; (printed by Peter Short for Cuthbert Burby). This text was republished in 1596 (again by Short for Burby) and 1607 (by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling). The play as it exists today was first published in the &quot;First Folio&quot; as &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): there is a general lack of scholarly agreement regarding the exact relationship between the 1594 &quot;A Shrew&quot; and the 1623 &quot;The Shrew&quot;. Originally, &quot;A Shrew&quot; was seen as a non-Shakespearean source for &quot;The Shrew&quot;, meaning &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594. This remained the predominant theory until 1850, when Samuel Hickson suggested that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was in some way derived from &quot;The Shrew&quot;. Peter Alexander developed Hickson&#x27;s work into his reported text/bad quarto theory, which necessitates that &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been written prior to 2 May 1594. However, there are other theories about the relationship between the texts. In 1942, R. A. Houk posited the &quot;&quot;Ur-Shrew&quot; theory (in analogy with the &quot;&quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; theory), suggesting that the plays are two completely unrelated texts by different authors based on the same (now lost) source. In 1943, G. I. Duthie refined this theory, suggesting that &quot;A Shrew&quot; was a reported text of an early draft of &quot;The Shrew&quot;. In his 1998 edition of &quot;A Shrew&quot; for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Stephen Roy Miller suggested &quot;A Shrew&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;The Shrew&quot; written by someone other than Shakespeare. Critics remain divided on this issue.
:First recorded performance: according to Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary, a play called &quot;The Tamynge of A Shrowe&quot; was performed at Newington Butts on 11 June 1594. This could have been either the 1594 &quot;A Shrew&quot; or the Shakespearean &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but as the Admiral&#x27;s Men and the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, Shakespeare&#x27;s own company, were sharing the theatre at the time, and, thus, Shakespeare himself was probably there, scholars tend to assume that it was &quot;The Shrew&quot; The Shakespearean version was definitely performed at court before Charles I and Henrietta Maria on 26 November 1633, where it was described as &quot;likt.&quot;
:Evidence: a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for &quot;A Shrew&quot; would seem to be August 1592; a stage direction at 3.21 mentions &quot;Simon,&quot; which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell, who was buried on 21 August 1592. &quot;The Shrew&quot; must have been written earlier than 1593, as Anthony Chute&#x27;s &quot;Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore&#x27;s wife&quot; (published in June 1593) contains the line &quot;He calls his Kate, and she must come and kiss him.&quot; This must refer to &quot;The Shrew&quot;, as there is no corresponding &quot;kissing scene&quot; in &quot;A Shrew&quot;. There are also verbal similarities between both &quot;Shrew&quot; plays and the anonymous play &quot;A Knack to Know a Knave&quot; (first performed in June 1592). &quot;Knack&quot; features several passages common to both &quot;A Shrew&quot; and &quot;The Shrew&quot;, but it also borrows several passages unique to &quot;The Shrew&quot;. This suggests &quot;The Shrew&quot; was on stage before June 1592. However, Kier Elam further narrows the terminal date of &quot;The Shrew&quot; to 1591, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s probable use of two sources published that year: Abraham Ortelius&#x27;s map of Italy in the fourth edition of &quot;Theatrum Orbis Terrarum&quot; and John Florio&#x27;s &quot;Second Fruits&quot;. As neither &quot;Shrew&quot; play is likely to have been written any earlier than 1590, this places the likely date of composition of &quot;The Shrew&quot; as 1590–1591, with &quot;A Shrew&quot; written sometime prior to August 1592.

=== &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; (1591–1592) ===
:First official record: possibly in Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary. On 3 March 1592, Henslowe reports seeing a &quot;ne&quot; play called &quot;Harey the vj&quot; (i.e. &quot;Henry VI&quot;), which could be a reference to &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, although this is not universally accepted. An entry found in the Stationers&#x27; Register on 19 April 1602 transferring the rights from Thomas Millington to Thomas Pavier of &quot;The first and Second parte of Henry VJ&quot; is thought to refer to what we today call &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; and &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;, not &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. The first definite record of the play was not until the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The first Part of Henry the Sixt&quot;.
:First recorded performance: possibly on 3 March 1592 at The Rose, as seen by Philip Henslowe. The earliest definite performance was on 13 March 1738 at Covent Garden.
:Additional information (attribution): many critics consider &quot;1 Henry VI&quot; to have been written as a prequel to the successful two-part play, &quot;The Contention&quot; and &quot;True Tragedy&quot;. Possibly co-written with Thomas Nashe and/or other unidentified dramatists.
:Evidence: on 3 March 1592, Philip Henslowe saw a new play called &quot;Harey the vj&quot; at The Rose, but he gives no further information. In August, Thomas Nashe published &quot;Pierce Penniless, His Supplication to the Divell&quot;, in which he refers to a play he had recently seen featuring a rousing depiction of Lord Talbot, a major character in &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. Most critics take Nashe&#x27;s reference to Talbot as supportive of the fact that the play Henslowe saw was &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;. If, then, it was a new play in March 1592, and if we also assume that it was a prequel written after the other two plays in the trilogy, the play was most likely written in 1591 or very early 1592.

=== &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; (1591-1592) ===

:First official record: version of the play entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Thomas Millington on 12 March 1594 as &quot;a booke intituled, the firste parte of the Contention of the twoo famous houses of York and Lancaster with the deathe of the good Duke Humfrey and the banishement and Deathe of the Duke of Suffolk and the tragicall ende of the prowd Cardinall of Winchester, with the notable rebellion of Jack Cade and the Duke of Yorkes ffirste clayme unto the Crowne.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1594 as &quot;The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster, with the death of the good Duke Humphrey: And the banishment and death of the Duke of Suffolke, and the Tragicall end of the proud Cardinal of Winchester, with the notable Rebellion of Jack Cade: and the Duke of Yorke&#x27;s first claim unto the Crowne&quot; (printed by Thomas Creede for Thomas Millington). This text was republished in 1600 (by Valentine Simmes for Millington) and in 1619. The 1619 text was printed with the 1595 octavo of &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; under the title &quot;The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke. With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt&quot;, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; text of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; appears under the title &quot;The second Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Good Duke Humfrey&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): scholars are undecided as to the exact nature of the relationship between the 1594 &quot;The Contention&quot; and the 1623 &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. There are four main theories: &quot;The Contention&quot; is a bad quarto, a reported text constructed from memory based upon a performance of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;The Contention&quot; is an early draft of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;The Contention&quot; is both a bad quarto &quot;and&quot; an early draft (i.e. a reported text based upon a staging of an early draft of the play); &quot;The Contention&quot; is an anonymous source for &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Originally, the bad quarto theory was generally accepted by scholars. First suggested by Samuel Johnson in the original edition of &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot; (1765), it remained the predominant theory until challenged by Edmond Malone in &quot;The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare&quot; (1790), favouring the early draft theory. In 1929, Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory. Scholars have continued to debate the issue since then, with no real consensus reached. The source theory, originated by Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849 has fallen out of favour in the twentieth and twentieth-first centuries.
:First recorded performance: although it is known that the play was definitely performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, adaptations dominated the stage throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The earliest known such adaptation was in 1681, with John Crowne&#x27;s two-part play, &quot;Henry the Sixth, The First Part&quot; and &quot;The Misery of Civil War&quot;. Two more adaptations followed in 1723. The first was &quot;Humfrey Duke of Gloucester&quot; by Ambrose Philips, the second was Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;King Henry VI: A Tragedy&quot;, both of which adapted scenes from &quot;2 Henry VI&quot;. Another adaptation followed in 1817, J. H. Merivale&#x27;s &quot;Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster&quot;, which used material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; was on 23 April 1864 at the Surrey Theatre, directed by James Anderson.
:Evidence: it is known that &quot;True Tragedy&quot; (i.e. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;) was on stage by June 1592. It is also known that &quot;True Tragedy&quot; was definitely a sequel to &quot;The Contention&quot;, meaning &quot;The Contention&quot; must also have been on stage by early 1592 at the latest. It is also thought that &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; was a new play in March 1592. If &quot;The Contention&quot; predates &quot;1 Henry VI&quot;, the theatrical evidence would place the likely date of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; as 1591.

=== &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; (1591-1592) ===

:First official record: version of the play published in octavo in 1595. &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was never entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register.
:First published: version of the play published in octavo in 1595 as &quot;The True Tragedie of Richard Duke of Yorke, and the death of good King Henrie the Sixt, with the Whole Contention betweene the two Houses Lancaster and Yorke&quot; (printed by Peter Short for Thomas Millington). This text was republished in quarto in 1600 (by William White for Millington) and in 1619. The 1619 text was printed with the 1594 quarto of &quot;2 Henry VI&quot; under the title &quot;The Whole Contention betweene the two Famous Houses, Lancaster and Yorke. With the Tragicall ends of the good Duke Humfrey, Richard Duke of Yorke, and King Henrie the sixt&quot;, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; text of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; appears under the title &quot;The third Part of Henry the Sixt, with the death of the Duke of Yorke&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): scholars are undecided as to the exact nature of the relationship between the 1595 &quot;True Tragedy&quot; and the 1623 &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. There are four main theories: &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is a &quot;bad octavo&quot;, a reported text constructed from memory based upon a performance of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is an early draft of &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;; &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is both a bad quarto &quot;and&quot; an early draft (i.e. a reported text based upon a staging of an early draft of the play); &quot;True Tragedy&quot; is an anonymous source for &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Originally, the bad quarto theory was generally accepted by scholars. First suggested by Samuel Johnson in the original edition of &quot;The Plays of William Shakespeare&quot; (1765), it remained the predominant theory until challenged by Edmond Malone in &quot;The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare&quot; (1790), favouring the early draft theory. In 1929, Peter Alexander and Madeleine Doran re-established the dominance of the bad quarto theory. Scholars have continued to debate the issue since then, with no real consensus reached. The source theory, originated by Georg Gottfried Gervinus in 1849 has fallen out of favour in the twentieth and twentieth-first centuries.
:First recorded performance: although it is known that the play was definitely performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, adaptations dominated the stage throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The earliest known such adaptation was in 1681, with John Crowne&#x27;s two-part play, &quot;Henry the Sixth, The First Part&quot; and &quot;The Misery of Civil War&quot;. In 1699, &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was also partly incorporated into Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;The Tragical History of King Richard the Third&quot;. In 1723, Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;King Henry VI: A Tragedy&quot; also adapted scenes from &quot;3 Henry VI&quot;. Another adaptation followed in 1817, J. H. Merivale&#x27;s &quot;Richard Duke of York; or the Contention of York and Lancaster&quot;, which used material from all three &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, but removed everything not directly related to York. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; was on 4 May 1906 at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, directed by F. R. Benson.
:Evidence: in &quot;Groatsworth of Wit&quot;, Robert Greene writes about &quot;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his &#x27;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in a player&#x27;s hide&#x27;, supposes that he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you, and being an absolute &quot;Johannes fac totum&quot;, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.&quot; Possibly directed at Shakespeare, this is a reference to a line in &quot;3 Henry VI&quot; when York refers to Margaret as a &quot;tiger&#x27;s heart wrapped in woman&#x27;s hide&quot; (1.4.137). As &quot;Groatsworth&quot; was registered in the Stationers&#x27; Register on 20 September 1592, this means that &quot;True Tragedy&quot; must have been on stage prior to 23 June 1592, as that was when the government shut the London theatres due to an outbreak of plague. To have been on stage by June 1592, the play was most likely written sometime in 1591.

=== &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (1591–1592) ===

:First official record: Philip Henslowe&#x27;s diary, 24 January 1594, where he records seeing the play &quot;titus &amp; ondronicus&quot; at The Rose.
:First published: published in quarto in February 1594 as &quot;The Most Lamentable Romaine Tragedie of Titus Andronicus&quot;, the first known printing of a Shakespearean play (printed by John Danter for Edward White and Thomas Millington). The play was republished in 1600 (printed by James Roberts for White) and 1611 (printed by Edward Allde for White). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus&quot;.
:First recorded performance: on 24 January 1594 performed by Sussex&#x27;s Men at The Rose, as recorded in Henslowe&#x27;s diary.
:Additional information (attribution): &quot;Titus&quot; is most likely a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist, probably George Peele.
:Evidence: E. A. J. Honigmann dates the play to 1586, arguing it to be Shakespeare&#x27;s first piece, written several years prior to his arrival in London. In his 1994 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Alan Hughes makes a similar argument, suggesting a date of 1588. Most scholars, however, tend to favour a post-1590 date, although there is by no means a consensus amongst them as to what that date may be. In his introduction to the 2001 edition of the play for the New Penguin Shakespeare (edited by Sonia Massai), Jacques Berthoud argues for a date of 1591; in his 1984 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, Eugene M. Waith argues for a date of 1592; in his 1995 edition for the Arden Shakespeare, Jonathan Bate argues for a date of 1593. What is known is that the play is unlikely to have been written later than June 1592, as that was when the London theatres were closed due to an outbreak of plague. Additionally, stylistic analysis has shown that &quot;Titus&quot; belongs to Shakespeare&#x27;s pre-plague group of plays. If it is assumed that the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy was complete by March 1592 at the latest, it would suggest &quot;Titus&quot; was composed either immediately afterwards, or perhaps simultaneously as he was completing them, suggesting a date of late 1591/early 1592.

=== &quot;Richard III&quot; (1592–1593) ===

:First official record: version of the play entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Andrew Wise on 20 October 1597 as &quot;The tragedie of kinge Richard the Third w the death of the duke of Clarence.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in December 1597 as &quot;The tragedy of King Richard the third. Containing, his treacherous plots against his brother Clarence: the pittiefull murther of his innocent nephewes: his tyrannicall usurpation: with the whole course of his detested life, and most deserved death&quot; (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise). This text was republished in 1598 (by Thomas Creede for Wise), 1603 (again by Creede for Wise), 1605 (by Creede for Matthew Lawe), 1612 (again by Creede for Lawe) and 1622 (by Thomas Purfoot for Lawe). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedy of Richard the Third, with the Landing of Earle Richmond, and the Battell at Bosworth Field&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): because the 1597 quarto is of such good quality, without the obvious errors common to the &#x27;original&#x27; bad quartos, as designated by Alfred W. Pollard (the 1597 &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, the 1602 &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, the 1600 &quot;Henry V&quot; and the 1603 &quot;Hamlet&quot;), scholars are undecided as to the exact relationship between the quarto and the 1623 folio texts. If Q1 is a bad quarto, it is an uncommonly &quot;good&quot; bad quarto. It is thought that F1 was set from Q3 (the 1605 text), Q6 (the 1622 text) and the author&#x27;s foul papers, and, as a result, Q1 and F1 differ from one another substantially. Most significantly, F1 contains roughly 230 lines not in Q1, Q1 contains roughly 40 lines not in F1, there are over 2000 textual differences, some scenes are arranged differently (including the order of the entry of the ghosts in 5.4), and Q1 has fewer characters than F1. There are two main theories: the quarto is a reported text, reconstructed from memory based on a performance of the play; the quarto is a performance text, a refined version of the longer folio text written by Shakespeare himself after the play had been staged. No real consensus has been reached on this issue.
:First recorded performance: the play was performed extensively in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime, and evidence would seem to suggest it was one of his most popular plays; it is mentioned in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; in 1598 (as &quot;&quot;Richard the&quot; 3.&quot;), and by the time of the &quot;First Folio&quot; in 1623, had been published in quarto six times, and referenced by multiple writers of the day. Regarding specific performances, however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, John Manningham mentions seeing Richard Burbage playing the role of Richard, probably at the Globe, where his performance so impressed a female member of the audience that she asked him to visit her later that night in the guise of Richard. The earliest definite performance was at St James&#x27;s Palace on 16 or 17 November 1633 by the King&#x27;s Men.
:Evidence: it is known that &quot;Richard III&quot; was definitely a sequel to &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, which was on stage by 23 June 1592, hence &quot;Richard III&quot; must have been written roughly around the same period. A common argument regarding Shakespeare&#x27;s chronology at this point in his career is that &quot;Richard III&quot; is a significantly better play than any of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, with a much tighter structure, a more mature manner and a greater degree of stylistic control. This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of Senecan tragedy when composing &quot;Titus&quot;, which he was then able to incorporate into &quot;Richard&quot;. Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for Lord Strange&#x27;s Men, but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to Pembroke&#x27;s Men, a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange&#x27;s Men was Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby, a direct descendant of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, a major character in the play. However, Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;History of King Richard III&quot;) regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field, when it was, in fact, his brother William who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company&#x27;s patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke&#x27;s Men, Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined Richmond&#x27;s cause is read aloud, two of whom are &quot;Sir Walter Herbert, a renown&#x27;d soldier&quot; (4.5.9) and &quot;redoubted Pembroke&quot; (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5–8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by &quot;three lords&quot; in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest additions after the initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley&#x27;s ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange&#x27;s Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke&#x27;s Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.

=== &quot;Edward III&quot; (1592–1593) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Cuthbert Burby on 1 December 1595 as &quot;a booke intituled Edward the Third and the blacke prince their warres w kinge Iohn of Fraunce.&quot;
:First published: published in quarto in 1596 as &quot;The Raigne of King Edvvard the third&quot; (printed anonymously for Burby). This text was republished in 1599 (printed by Simon Stafford for Burby).
:First recorded performance: although it is known from the 1596 quarto title page that the play had been performed in London during the 1590s, the earliest recorded performance was not until 6 March 1911 at the Little Theatre, directed by Gertrude Kingston and William Poel. However, this production presented only the first half of the play (dealing with the Edward&#x27;s infatuation with the Countess of Salisbury). Performed under the title, &quot;The King and the Countess&quot;, it was presented in a single matinée performance with the anonymous sixteenth century liturgical drama, &quot;Jacob and Esau&quot;. The first known performance of the complete text took place in June 1986 at the Globe Playhouse in Los Angeles, directed by Dick Dotterer, as part of the Shakespeare Society of America&#x27;s presentation of the entire &#x27;canon&#x27; of Shakespeare Apocrypha. The first known production of the play in the United Kingdom was in July 1987, at the Theatr Clwyd, directed by Toby Robertson.
:Additional information (attribution): first attributed to Shakespeare by the booksellers Richard Rogers and William Ley in 1656, Shakespeare&#x27;s possible authorship of the play was first investigated by Edward Capell in 1760. Although the question of authorship remains unresolved, many scholars do now agree that Shakespeare was involved in some way with writing the play and that it deserves a place in the Shakespearean canon. The play was included in the 2nd edition of the &quot;Riverside Shakespeare&quot; in 1996. In 1998, Giorgio Melchiori edited the first stand-alone scholarly edition of the play, for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. The play was also included in the 2nd edition of &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works&quot; in 2005, edited by William Montgomery, and in the 2nd edition of the &quot;Norton Shakespeare&quot; in 2008. The Arden Shakespeare published an edition of the play in 2017, edited by Richard Proudfoot and Nicola Bennett.
:Evidence: &quot;Edward III&quot; has been assigned many different possible dates of composition by a number of scholars. For example, Karl P. Wentersdorf favours a date of 1589–1590. MacDonald P. Jackson argues for 1590–1591. Roger Prior argues for a date of 1594. Obviously, the play was written by December 1595. A &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of 1590 can be fixed by Shakespeare&#x27;s use of several post-1590 accounts of the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. According to the title page of the 1596 quarto, the play had been performed recently in London, but no company information is provided. However, both MacDonald P. Jackson and Richard Proudfoot have argued that &quot;Edward III&quot; must have been part of the repertory of Pembroke&#x27;s Men. This would explain the absence of an acting company on the title page; the company that performed the play had disbanded during the closure of the theatres from June 1592 to March 1594 (Pembroke&#x27;s Men disbanded in September 1593). Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke&#x27;s Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke&#x27;s Men are pre-plague; &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;The Contention&quot;, &quot;True Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. &quot;Edward III&quot;, however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast-intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to &quot;True Tragedy&quot; or &quot;Richard III&quot;, and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.

=== &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; (1594) ===
:First official record: Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), referred to as &quot;&quot;Errors&quot;.&quot;
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: probably on Innocents Day, 28 December 1594, at Gray&#x27;s Inn (one of the four London Inns of Court). The only known evidence for this performance is the &quot;Gesta Grayorum&quot;, a 1688 text printed for William Canning based on a manuscript apparently handed down from the 1590s, detailing the &quot;Prince of Purpoole&quot; festival from December 1594 to February 1595. According to the text, after a disastrous attempt to stage &quot;some notable performance […] it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to &quot;Plautus&quot; his &quot;Menaechmus&quot;) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, &quot;The Night of Errors&quot;.&quot; As &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot; is indeed based on &quot;Menaechmus&quot;, this is almost universally accepted as a reference to a performance of the play, probably by Shakespeare&#x27;s own company, the newly formed Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. The earliest known definite performance was at court on 28 December 1604.
:Evidence: traditionally, &quot;Errors&quot; has been dated quite early, and has often been seen as Shakespeare&#x27;s first comedy, perhaps his first play. However, stylistic and linguistic analysis (proportion of verse to prose, amount of rhyme, use of colloquialism-in-verse, and a rare word test) has placed it closer to the composition of &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, both of which were written in 1594 or 1595. More specifically, the limited setting (it is one of only two Shakespeare plays to observe the Classical unities) and the brevity of the play (Shakespeare&#x27;s shortest at 1777 lines), along with the great abundance of legal terminology, suggests the play may have been written specifically for the Gray&#x27;s Inn performance. This would place its composition in the latter half of 1594.

=== &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; (1594–1597) ===

:First official record: the play was published in quarto in 1598, although the exact date is unknown, as it was not entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register at the time. Also in 1598, Robert Tofte mentioned the play in his sonnet sequence &quot;Alba. The months minde of a melancholy lover&quot;; &quot;&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour Lost&quot;, I once did see, a play/Y&#x27;cleped so, so called to my pain.&quot; The date of publication of &quot;Alba&quot; is unknown as it also was not entered into the Register. Additionally, the play is mentioned in Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (registered on 7 September, with a dedication dated 10 October). It is unknown exactly which one of these three constitutes the first official record of the play.
:First published: published in quarto in 1598 as &quot;A Pleasant Conceited Comedie called Loues labors lost&quot;, the first known printing of a Shakespearean play to include his name on the title page (printed by William Wright for Cuthbert Burby). However, due to the note &quot;Newly corrected and augmented,&quot; it is known that a previous publication must have existed, which has apparently been lost.
:First recorded performance: according to the quarto title page, the play was performed at court for Queen Elizabeth sometime over Christmas 1597, but no further information is provided. The earliest definite performance took place sometime between 8 and 15 January 1605, for Anne of Denmark, at the house of either Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, or Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury.
:Evidence: the play was likely written by Christmas 1597, but narrowing the date further has proved difficult, with most efforts focusing upon stylistic evidence. Traditionally, it was seen as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s earliest plays. For example, Charles Gildon wrote in 1710; &quot;since it is one of the worst of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;″s Plays, nay I think I may say the very worst, I cannot but think that it is his first.&quot; For much of the eighteenth century, it tended to be dated to 1590, until Edmond Malone&#x27;s newly constructed chronology in 1778, which dated it 1594. In his 1930 chronology, E. K. Chambers found the play to be slightly more sophisticated than Malone had allowed for, and dated it 1595. Today most scholars tend to concur with a date of 1594–1595, and the play is often grouped with the &#x27;lyrical plays&#x27;; &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, because of its prolific use of rhyming. These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare&#x27;s career when he was experimenting with rhyming iambic pentameter as an alternative form to standard blank verse; &quot;Richard II&quot; has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Midsummer Night&quot; more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively). All four tend to be dated to the period 1594–1595. In support of this, Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test places the play after &quot;Richard III&quot;, which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Gary Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray&#x27;s Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite masque in 5.2) and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough&#x27;s argument that the satirical presentation of the King of Navarre (loosely based on Henry of Navarre, who was associated with oath-breaking after abjuring Protestantism in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt by Jean Châtel. All of this suggests Shakespeare was writing the play in 1595, although revisions may have continued until the performance before the Queen in Christmas 1597.

=== &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot; (1595–1598) ===

:First official record: Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), referred to as &quot;&quot;Love labours wonne&quot;.&quot;
:First published: prior to 1603; format and exact date unknown.
:First recorded performance: there are no recorded performances of the play, but the fact that it is mentioned in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; strongly suggests it was performed.
:Additional information (existence): there are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, the other is a fragment of Christopher Hunt&#x27;s inventory, listing sixteen &quot;ludes and tragedyes&quot; sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;The Taming of a Shrew&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;. Up until 1953, only Meres&#x27;s reference was known, until Hunt&#x27;s two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of Thomas Gataker&#x27;s &quot;Certaine Sermones&quot;. The discovery was handed over to T. W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year&#x27;s time). But whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare&#x27;s known plays, a situation similar to &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, which was originally performed with the title &quot;All is True&quot;. As Meres refers to &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;. &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; and &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; have also been cited as possibilities, with &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot; the most favoured. But these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot; is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.
:Evidence: the play&#x27;s position in the chronology is based purely on the speculation that it was a sequel to &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;.

=== &quot;Richard II&quot; (1595) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Andrew Wise on 29 August 1597 as &quot;the Tragedye of Richard the Second.&quot;
:First published: published in quarto in 1597 as &quot;The Tragedie of King Richard the second&quot; (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise). This text was republished twice in 1598 (on both occasions by Simmes for Wise), 1608 (by William Wright for Matthew Lawe) and 1615 (again by Wright for Lawe). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The life and death of King Richard the Second&quot;.
:First recorded performance: possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir Edward Hoby&#x27;s house. On that date, Hoby&#x27;s wife, Margaret Carey, daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men), wrote a letter to Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see &quot;K. Richard present him self to your vewe.&quot; This could be a reference to a private performance of &quot;Richard II&quot;, especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare&#x27;s company. However, some scholars argue that &quot;K. Richard&quot; could be a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that even if it is a play, it necessarily refers to &quot;Richard II&quot;, suggesting it could refer to &quot;Richard III&quot; or to another play entirely. There is no complete consensus on this issue, although most scholars do tend to favour the &quot;Richard II&quot; theory. The earliest definite performance was at the Globe on 7 February 1601, organised by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. This performance was probably intended to inspire his supporters on the eve of his armed rebellion against Queen Elizabeth.
:Evidence: &quot;Richard II&quot; is usually seen as one of the &#x27;lyrical plays&#x27;, along with &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate punning, rhetorical patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of metrical regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594–1595. Also important in dating the play is Samuel Daniel&#x27;s &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot;, which was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595. Recent analysis of an extant early manuscript of Daniel&#x27;s poem, however, suggests that Shakespeare could have used such a manuscript as a source, making an earlier date possible.

=== &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1595) ===

:First official record: version of the play published in quarto in 1597. The play was not entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register at the time, not appearing until 22 July 1607.
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1597 as &quot;An excellent conceited tragedie of Romeo and Iuliet&quot; (printed by John Danter for Cuthbert Burby). A revised version, &quot;newly corrected, augmented and amended,&quot; was published in 1599 as &quot;The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Iuliet&quot; (printed by Thomas Creede for Burby). This text was republished in 1609 (by John Windet for John Smethwick) and 1622 (by William Stansby for Smethwick). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): the 1597 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. However, in his 2007 edition of the quarto text for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Lukas Erne argues that although the text does exhibit many signs of memorial reconstruction, there is also evidence of authorial revision, and he believes the Q1 text is a closer representation of the play as it would have been performed at the time than either the longer Q2 or the 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; text (which was set from Q2).
:First recorded performance: 1 March 1662 at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, performed by the Duke&#x27;s Company. Samuel Pepys wrote of the production (the first since the reopening of the theatres), &quot;it is the play of itself the worst that ever I heard in my life, and the worst acted that ever I saw these people do.&quot;
:Evidence: as there is virtually no external evidence (other than the quarto text which establishes 1597 as a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;) with which to date the play, most arguments tend to centre on references within the play to topical events, publication dates of Shakespeare&#x27;s influences, and stylistic evidence. A much-discussed possible topical allusion is the Nurse&#x27;s reference to an earthquake which took place eleven years previously (1.3.24-36). The specificity of this reference has led many scholars to argue that Shakespeare must have been referring to a real earthquake. Originally, Thomas Tyrwhitt suggested the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake, which would place the composition of the play in 1591. Sidney Thomas, on the other hand, argues it may refer to a quake on 1 March 1584, mentioned in William Covell&#x27;s &quot;Polimanteia&quot;, which was published in 1595 and with which Shakespeare was apparently familiar. This would suggest a date of composition of 1595. Influences on the play include Samuel Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Complaint of Rosamund&quot; (1592) and John Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Ortho-epia Gallica&quot; (1593), suggesting the play could not have been composed earlier than 1593. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it closest to &quot;Richard II&quot;, Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test places it immediately after &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; and immediately prior to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and a rare word test links it most closely to &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. Stylistically, the play is also firmly situated within the &#x27;lyrical plays&#x27;, which are all dated 1594–1595. This would correspond to the 1584 earthquake (assuming Shakespeare had in mind a particular quake at all), and suggest a main composition date of 1595. However, in her 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Jill L. Levenson argues that the play was most likely composed over several years, possibly covering a span as wide as 1593–1599.

=== &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1595) ===

:First official record: Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598); referred to as &quot;&quot;Midsummers night dreame&quot;.&quot;
:First published: published in November or December 1600 as &quot;A Midsommer nights dreame&quot; (printed by Richard Bradock for Thomas Fisher). This text was republished in 1619, with a title page date of 1600 and the name of the printer James Roberts. However, this reprint was part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier). The play had never been printed by Roberts.
:First recorded performance: 1 January 1605 at court, when Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, reported to John Chamberlain the acting of a masque &quot;of Robin goode-fellow.&quot; The first definite performance took place on 29 September 1662 at Drury Lane, as reported by Samuel Pepys, who described it as &quot;the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life.&quot;
:Evidence: stylistically, &quot;Midsummer Night&quot; is very much part of the &#x27;lyrical plays&#x27;, which would suggest a date of composition in 1594 or 1595. A strong argument that it was written immediately after &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is the nature of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F. Brooks argues that Shakespeare used the source story from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; first to examine the tragic potential and then to exploit its comic and farcical elements in his next play. A possible topical allusion is the line &quot;the death/Of learning, late decreased in beggary&quot; (5.1.52–53), which could refer to the spate of deaths of popular playwrights in the early 1590s; Robert Greene in 1592, Christopher Marlowe in 1593 and Thomas Kyd in 1594. That the play culminates with the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta has led some to theorise it may have been written specifically for a wedding, with the most likely candidates being either the marriage of William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby, and Elizabeth de Vere on 26 January 1595, or that of Sir Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey on 19 February 1596. That the second is the more likely of the two is due to the fact that Elizabeth&#x27;s grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, and her father was George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. If the play was written for a wedding in February 1596, it was most likely composed in 1595. However, there is no solid evidence to suggest that the play was in fact written for a wedding, and most scholars are in agreement that stylistic evidence alone is sufficient to date the play to &quot;c.&quot;1595.

=== &quot;King John&quot; (1596) ===

:First official record: Francis Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), referred to as &quot;&quot;King Iohn&quot;.&quot;
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The life and death of King Iohn&quot;.
:First recorded performance: although numerous references to the play throughout the seventeenth century indicate that it was performed with some frequency and success, there is no definite record of any specific performance. The first documented performance was on 26 February 1737, produced by John Rich at Drury Lane.
:Evidence: &quot;King John&quot; can be a difficult play to date due to the lack of any real external evidence or internal topical allusions. Scholars have instead been forced to rely on stylistic evidence, and speculation regarding the play&#x27;s relationship with the anonymous two-part play &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (&quot;c.&quot;1589), which was published in 1611 and 1622 under Shakespeare&#x27;s name. &quot;King John&quot; was obviously in existence by 1598, as it is mentioned in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, and most scholars agree that Shakespeare used &quot;Troublesome Reign&quot; as a source, meaning it must have been written after 1589. In his 1954 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, however, E. A. J. Honigmann argues that &quot;Troublesome Reign&quot; is actually an adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King John&quot; based on the recollections of a performance, and hence &quot;King John&quot; was written prior to 1589. Although most scholars disagree with Honigmann on this point, the exact nature of the relationship between the two plays remains open to question. Stylistic evidence serves to locate the play in the mid-1590s. Both a rare word test and Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test place it after &quot;Richard II&quot;. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it prior to the two &quot;Henry IV&quot; plays. All three of these plays were definitely written during the 1590s, suggesting &quot;King John&quot; must also have been written in that decade. Furthermore, Barron Brainerd&#x27;s statistical analysis of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays places &quot;King John&quot; just past the mid-way point of the decade, after &quot;Richard II&quot; and prior to &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;.

=== &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1596–1597) ===
:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by James Roberts on 22 July 1598 as &quot;a booke of the Marchaunt of Venyce or otherwise called the Iewe of Venyce.&quot;
:First published: published in quarto in 1600 as &quot;The Excellent History of the Merchant of Venice. With the extreame crueltie of Shylocke the Jewe towards the sayd merchant, in cutting a just pound of his flesh: and the obtayning of Portia by the choyse of three chests&quot; (printed by James Roberts for Thomas Heyes). This text was republished in 1619, with a title page date of 1600 and the name of the printer James Roberts. This reprint was part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier).
:First recorded performance: although the title page of the 1600 quarto indicates the play was performed in the latter years of the sixteenth century, the earliest recorded performance was by the King&#x27;s Men at Whitehall Palace for King James on 10 February 1605. James liked the play so much that he asked for it to be performed again two days later, on Shrove Tuesday.
:Evidence: the play was obviously in existence by 1598. But other evidence places its date of composition as probably 1596 or very early 1597. An important topical allusion is Salarino&#x27;s reference to &quot;my wealthy &quot;Andrew&quot; docked in sand&quot; (1.1.28). This is thought to refer to the &quot;San Andrés&quot;, a Spanish galleon that ran aground in Cádiz in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the &quot;St. Andrew&quot; and incorporated into the Royal Navy. But she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the Thames Estuary. In August, she served as a troopship during the Islands Voyage, and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the Goodwin Sands, a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4–5). All of this suggests the play was written in the latter half of 1596 or very early 1597 when audiences would have been most perceptive to the &quot;Andrew&quot; reference. It has also been theorised that the play may have been written to capitalise on the enormous success of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;. Although &quot;Malta&quot; had been written in 1589 or 1590, it remained extremely popular throughout the 90s, and was revived on stage in 1596 when it was performed eight times by the Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men.

=== &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (1596–1597) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Andrew Wise on 25 February 1598 as &quot;a booke intituled The historye of Henry the IIIJ with his battaile of Shrewsburye against Henry Hottspurre of the Northe with The conceited mirthe of Sir John Ffalstoff.&quot;
:First published: two quarto texts were published in 1598. Only a fragment of one (designated Q0) has survived, running from 1.3.201-2.2.105. The other copy (Q1) was published under the title &quot;The History of Henrie the Fourth, with the battell at Shrewsburie between the King and Lord Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur of the North, with the humorous conceits of Sir John Falstaffe&quot; (printed by Peter Short for Andrew Wise). This text was republished in 1599 (by Simon Stafford for Wise), 1604 (by Valentine Simmes for Matthew Lawe), 1608 (by John Windet for Lawe), 1613 (by William White for Lawe) and 1622 (by Thomas Purfoot for Lawe). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The First Part of Henry the Fourth, with the Life and Death of Henry Sirnamed Hot-spurre&quot;.
:First recorded performance: possibly on 6 March 1600 at the house of George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon for the Flemish ambassador. In a letter dated 8 March from Rowland Whyte to Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, Whyte mentions that Hunsdon employed the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men to perform a play called &quot;&quot;Sir John Old Castlle&quot;.&quot; Originally, Falstaff was called Sir John Oldcastle, but Shakespeare was pressured into changing the name. Although &quot;&quot;Sir John Old Castlle&quot; could be a reference to &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot; by Anthony Munday, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye and Robert Wilson, the fact that Hunsdon was using Shakespeare&#x27;s own company, rather than the rival Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men, suggests the play referred to was in fact &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;. Another possible performance took place on or around 14 February 1613, when either &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; or &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (or both) were performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. A play performed under the title &quot;The Hotspur&quot; is thought to refer to &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;. The first definite performance was on 1 January 1625 at Whitehall as &quot;The First Part of Sir John Falstaff&quot;.
:Evidence: as with &quot;Richard II&quot;, the play uses Samuel Daniel&#x27;s &quot;The First Four Books of the Civil Wars&quot; as a source, meaning it could not have been written earlier than 1595. The fact that it is a direct sequel to &quot;Richard II&quot; would further limit the date of composition to no later than 1597 as Shakespeare would not have wanted to wait too long to capitalise on the success of the previous play. The controversy regarding the Oldcastle character also helps date the play. Shakespeare was pressured into changing the name by the descendants of the historical Sir John Oldcastle, particularly William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham, and his son Henry. William served as Lord Chamberlain from August 1596 to March 1597, and only in that period would he have had the authority to demand the alteration of a play which he found objectionable. This could indicate an initial performance in late 1596 or early 1597, suggesting composition took place roughly around the same time.

=== &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1597) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by John Busby on 18 January 1602 as &quot;A booke called An excellent and pleasant conceited commedie of Sir John Faulstof and the merry wyves of Windesor.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1602 as &quot;A most pleasaunt and excellent conceited Comedie, of Syr John Falstaffe, and the merrie Wives of Windsor. Entermixed with sundrie variable and pleasing humours, of Syr Hugh the Welch knight, Justice Shallow, and his wise cousin M. Slender. With the swaggering vaine of Auncient Pistoll, and Corporall Nym&quot; (printed by Thomas Creede for Arthur Johnson). This text was republished in 1619 as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier).
:Additional information (publication): the 1602 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. The quarto text is 1620 lines, compared to the 2729 line &quot;Folio&quot; text. 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and much of 5.5 are absent from Q1, 3.4 and 3.5 are transposed and numerous speeches within individual scenes are also transposed. In his 1910 edition of the quarto text, W.W. Greg wrote &quot;my own study of &quot;Merry Wives&quot; has led me to doubt whether any limit can be set to the possible perversion which a text may suffer at the hands of a reporter.&quot; However, more recent editions of the play, such as David Crane&#x27;s 1997 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare and Giorgio Melchiori&#x27;s 2000 edition for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, have questioned the likelihood of memorial reconstruction being wholly responsible for the text, arguing for a more complex provenance.
:First recorded performance: on 4 November 1604, in the banqueting hall of Whitehall Palace, performed by the King&#x27;s Men for Charles I.
:Evidence: writing in 1702, John Dennis claimed Shakespeare wrote the play in fourteen days at the behest of Queen Elizabeth. In 1709, Nicholas Rowe claimed Elizabeth commissioned Shakespeare to write the play, because she liked the character of Falstaff so much in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; that she wanted to see him in love. Neither claim is given much weight by scholars today. The composition of the play definitely postdates the Oldcastle controversy concerning &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, as the character is, and seemingly always was, called Falstaff in &quot;Merry Wives&quot;. One area examined by scholars in an effort to date the composition of the play is where in the plot of the &quot;Henriad&quot; the narrative of &quot;Merry Wives&quot; is supposed to take place. &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; was definitely written by early 1597. &quot;Henry V&quot; was completed by September 1599. &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; was written at some point between these two. Exactly where &quot;Merry Wives&quot; fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall &quot;Henriad&quot; have proved fruitless. The plot of &quot;Merry Wives&quot; does not fit into the plot of the &quot;Henriad&quot; in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and Mistress Quickly don&#x27;t know one another at the start of &quot;Merry Wives&quot;, whereas in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, they have known one another for over thirty years. John Jowett, editor of the play for the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot;, argues it is not supposed to fit into the &quot;Henriad&quot; at all, it is &quot;essentially an Elizabethan comedy, the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England. The play is full of details that would have been familiar to Elizabethan Londoners, and the language is colloquial and up to date.&quot; Textual evidence and topical allusions led John Leslie Hotson to argue the play was specifically commissioned for a performance on Saint George&#x27;s Day (23 April) 1597, as part of the celebrations for the Garter Feast (an annual meeting of the Order of the Garter). Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights. Hotson contends the play was his contribution to the festivities. If one accepts this theory, it suggests that Shakespeare interrupted his composition of &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; to hastily compose &quot;Merry Wives&quot; after Hunsdon&#x27;s commission. This is important because traditionally, &quot;Merry Wives&quot; has been dated &quot;c.&quot; 1600, a date supported by verse analysis. However, verse makes up very little of the play, and if Shakespeare was writing extremely fast, the reliability of the test would be compromised. Scholars who accept the theory that Shakespeare stopped writing &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; to write &quot;Merry Wives&quot; theorise that he did so somewhere between 3.2 and 4.2.

=== &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; (1597–1598) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August 1600 as &quot;the seconde parte of the history of Kinge Henry the iiij with the humours of Sir Iohn Ffallstaff.&quot; Jointly entered with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;.
:First published: published in quarto in 1600 as &quot;The second part of Henrie the fourth, continuing to his death, and coronation of Henrie the fift. With the humours of Sir John Falstaffe, and swaggering Pistoll&quot; (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley) The 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, Containing his Death: and the Coronation of King Henry the Fift&quot;.
:First recorded performance: probable performance took place on or around 14 February 1613, when either &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; or &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; (or both) were performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. A play performed under the title &quot;Sir Iohn Falstaffe&quot; is thought to refer to &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;. It is unlikely to refer to &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; as a play under the name &quot;The Hotspur&quot; would seem to indicate that play. Additionally, a list of plays under consideration for court performance in 1620, compiled by George Buck, Master of the Revels, mentions the &quot;Second part of Falstaffe not plaid theis 7. yeres.&quot; This would seem to confirm the 1613 performance as &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;, as, due to the lack of republication of the initial 1600 quarto text, it is known that &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; was not nearly as popular as &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; (which was republished five times prior to 1623).
:Evidence: as a sequel to &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; and a prequel to &quot;Henry V&quot;, the play was obviously written at some point between the two. We know that &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; was probably written by early 1597 at the latest, and that &quot;Henry V&quot; was written by September 1599, so &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; can be dated from early 1597 to September 1599. There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; would suggest the play was written after the censoring of &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; in 1596/1597. The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers&#x27; Register entry for &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; does not identify it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that &quot;2 Henry IV&quot; could not have been completed by that date. There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man out of His Humour&quot;, which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion. All of this seems to place the date of composition as somewhere in late 1597/early 1598.

=== &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1598–1599) ===
:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as &quot;The cōmedie of muche A doo about nothinge.&quot; Grouped with &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; under the heading &quot;to be staied.&quot; Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of &quot;to be staied&quot; is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. The play was formally entered into the Register by Andrew Wise and William Aspley on 23 August as &quot;Muche a Doo about nothing.&quot; Jointly entered with &quot;2 Henry IV&quot;.
:First published: published in quarto in 1600 as &quot;Much adoe about Nothing&quot; (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley).
:First recorded performance: on or around 14 February 1613, when the play was performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine.
:Evidence: the play is not mentioned in Meres&#x27;s &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, which tentatively suggests it had not been performed by September 1598. Although it has been suggested that &quot;Much Ado&quot; could be &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;, the discovery of the list written by Christopher Hunt in 1603 refutes this possibility, as Hunt mentions &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot; three years after &quot;Much Ado&quot; had been published under its own name. Furthermore, the quarto text includes the name &quot;Kempe&quot; as a speech heading throughout 4.2. This is universally recognised as referring to William Kempe, the leading comic actor of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, with the inference being that the role of Dogberry was specifically written for him. However, Kempe left the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men sometime in early 1599, suggesting the play must have been written before then. This suggests a date of composition in late 1598 and/or early 1599.

=== &quot;Henry V&quot; (1599) ===

:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as &quot;Henry the ffift.&quot; Grouped with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; under the heading &quot;to be staied.&quot; Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of &quot;to be staied&quot; is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. &quot;Henry V&quot; was formally entered into the Register by Thomas Pavier on 14 August as &quot;The historye of Henrye the v w the battell of Agencourt.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1600 as &quot;The cronicle history of Henry the fift, with his battell fought at Agin Court in France. Togither with Auntient Pistoll&quot; (printed by Thomas Creede for Thomas Millington and John Busby). This text was republished in 1602 (by Creede for Thomas Pavier) and 1619, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Pavier). The 1619 text is falsely dated 1608. The 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Life of Henry the Fift&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): the 1600 quarto text has traditionally been considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. However, in his 2000 edition of the quarto text for the New Cambridge: The Early Quartos series, Andrew Gurr argues that although the text was partially constructed from memory, it also represents a performance text, an abridged version of the &quot;Folio&quot; text constructed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men specifically for performance.
:First recorded performance: 7 January 1605 at court, performed by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men for King James.
:Evidence: of all Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, &quot;Henry V&quot; is perhaps the easiest to date. A reference by the Chorus to the 1599 Irish expedition of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, (5.0.29–34) means the play was most likely written sometime between 27 March 1599 (when Essex left for Ireland) and 24 September 1599 (when he returned in disgrace).

=== &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1599) ===
:First official record: mentioned in Thomas Platter the Younger&#x27;s Diary on 21 September 1599.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Tragedie of Ivlivs Cæsar&quot;.
:First recorded performance: in his diary on 21 September 1599, Thomas Platter records &quot;I went with my party across the water; in the straw-thatched house we saw the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius Caesar, very pleasingly performed, with approximately fifteen characters.&quot; This is almost universally accepted as a reference to a performance of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; at the recently opened Globe Theatre.
:Evidence: obviously, the play was completed by September 1599, and may have been composed specifically as the opening play for the new theatre. Other pieces of evidence also serve to link it to 1599. For example, the play&#x27;s absence from &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; suggests it had not been performed by September 1598. Furthermore, an apparent indebtedness to John Davies&#x27;s &quot;Nosce teipsum&quot; at 1.2.51–58 and another to Samuel Daniels&#x27;s &quot;Musophilus&quot; at 3.1.111–116 help situate the play in 1599. &quot;Musophilus&quot; was entered into the Stationers Register on 9 January of that year, and &quot;Nosce teipsum&quot; on 14 April. Both were published for the first time in 1599, fixing 1599 as the &quot;terminus post quem&quot;. Two allusions to the play in Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man Out of His Humour&quot;, registered on 8 April 1600, fix 1600 as the latest possible date of composition. Additionally, textual analysis has connected the play closely to &quot;Henry V&quot;, which was definitely written in 1599. In the fifth-act prologue of &quot;Henry V&quot;, the Chorus refers to &quot;antique Rome,&quot; &quot;plebeians&quot; and &quot;conqu&#x27;ring Caesar&quot; (5.0.26–28), suggesting Shakespeare may already have had his mind on his next play. Metrically, &quot;Caesar&quot; is closest to &quot;Henry V&quot;, and a colloquialism-in-verse test places it between &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

=== &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1599–1600) ===

:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register on a flyleaf dated 4 August 1600 as &quot;As y like yt.&quot; Grouped with &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot; and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; under the heading &quot;to be staied.&quot; Who wrote the note, the exact nature of the grouping of plays, and the meaning of &quot;to be staied&quot; is unknown, but is thought to have been an attempt by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men to prevent unauthorised printing of the plays listed. The play was not formally entered into the Register until its entry for the 1623 &quot;First Folio&quot;.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: possibly on 20 February 1599 at Richmond Park for Queen Elizabeth. The evidence comes from a payment to the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men for performances of three unnamed plays on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day 1598, New Year&#x27;s Day 1599, and Shrove Tuesday 1599 (i.e. 20 February). Juliet Dusinberre believes Touchstone&#x27;s reference to pancakes (1.2.50–51) provides evidence that &quot;As You Like It&quot; was the unnamed play performed on 20 February. Another possible early performance may have taken place in December 1603 at Wilton House. In 1865, William Johnson Cory said that whilst visiting Wilton, he was told of a letter from the Countess of Pembroke to her son, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, urging him to bring King James from Salisbury so he may see a performance of &quot;As You Like It&quot; at the house. James did come, residing at Wilton from 24 November to 12 December. Although Cory did not actually see the letter himself, and it has never been found or verified, a record of a payment to the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men for an unnamed play in December does exist, suggesting that something was performed at Wilton, but whether it was &quot;As You Like It&quot; seems impossible to ascertain. A Charles Johnson rewrite of the play, called &quot;Love in a Forest&quot;, was performed at Drury Lane on 9 January 1723. The earliest definite performance of the Shakespearean text was on 20 December 1740 at Drury Lane.
:Evidence: &quot;As You Like It&quot; is a difficult play to date due to a lack of solid external evidence, forcing scholars to rely on topical allusions, parallels with other work and stylistic analysis. Obviously, it was completed by August 1600. It is not mentioned in &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, which could fix the date of composition as sometime between September 1598 and August 1600. In 1600, Thomas Morley published his &quot;First Book of Airs&quot;, which includes a variation of the page&#x27;s song from 5.3 of &quot;As You Like It&quot;. According to the introduction of &quot;Airs&quot;, Morley compiled the book during the summer of 1599. It is unknown if Shakespeare borrowed from Morley, Morley from Shakespeare or if they collaborated, but irrespective of the exact nature of the relationship, it suggests that that particular passage was written between the summer of 1599 and early 1600. Possible topical allusions also locate the play in 1599/1600. For example, the line &quot;the little wit that fools have was silenced&quot; (1.2.82–83) may refer to the book burnings of June 1599, and Jacques&#x27; &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; monologue (2.7.139–166) is a possible reference to the motto of the newly opened Globe Theatre; &quot;&quot;Totus mundus agit histrionem&quot; (&quot;all the world is a playground&quot;), taken from Petronius. The Globe was open by 21 September 1599 at the latest, and possibly as early as 16 May 1599. Stylistic analysis has proved inconclusive in terms of establishing exactly where in the canon the play fits but has served to locate its composition to the turn of the century, and most scholars agree with a rough date of 1599 to 1600.

=== &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1599–1601) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by James Roberts on 26 July 1602 as &quot;a booke called The Revenge of Hamlett Prince Denmarke.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1603 as &quot;The tragicall historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke&quot; (printed by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling and John Trundell). A revised text, &quot;newly imprinted, and enlarged to almost as much againe as it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie&quot; was published in 1604/1605 (by Simmes for Ling). This text was republished in 1611 (by George Eld for John Smethwick) and 1622 (by William Stansby for Smethwick). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): the 1603 quarto text is considered a bad quarto, and was one of the original texts in relation to which Alfred W. Pollard coined the term. The 1603 quarto (Q1), the 1604/1605 quarto (Q2) and the 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; (F1) texts differ substantially from one another. Q1 is roughly 2200 lines, whilst Q2 is roughly 3800 lines. F1 is 230 lines shorter than Q2 but does include 77 lines not found in either Q1 or Q2. Verbal, grammatical and stylistic differences between the three texts number in the thousands. So different are Q1, Q2 and F1 that both Cambridge and Arden have issued two separate editions of the play; Cambridge published their standard scholarly edition in 1985, edited by Philip Edwards. In 1998, they followed this with a scholarly edition of the 1603 quarto as part of their Early Quartos series, edited by Kathleen O. Irace. Similarly, in 2006, Arden published two editions of the play; the standard edition (which uses Q2 as the control text) and a second edition, under the title &quot;Hamlet: The Texts of 1603 and 1623&quot;, both editions edited by Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor. The exact nature of the relationship between the three texts is still under debate. There is also the problem of &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot;, a possible source used by Shakespeare, now lost. Some scholars, however, feel that &quot;Ur-Hamlet&quot; (if it ever existed, which many doubt) was most likely an early draft.
:First recorded performance: the entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register in July 1602 states that the play was &quot;latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes.&quot; The title page of Q1 states that it had been performed in London, at Cambridge and Oxford universities, &quot;and else-where.&quot; However, there is no record of any of these performances. The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall&#x27;s &quot;Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496–1631&quot; (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain William Keeling, who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the East India Company that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, Keeling&#x27;s flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed &quot;Hamlet&quot; on the nights of 5 September and &quot;31 September&quot; (presumably 1 October), and &quot;Richard II&quot; on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling&#x27;s journal entry. Prior to Rundall&#x27;s book, Keeling&#x27;s journal had been published in 1625, but the references to &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Richard II&quot; were not included by the editor, Samuel Purchas. In his 1898 book, &quot;Life of Shakespeare&quot;, Sidney Lee claimed the entire &quot;Red Dragon&quot; episode was probably a forgery by John Payne Collier, and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship&#x27;s crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare&#x27;s most difficult plays. However, William Foster pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play. The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine. The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.

:Evidence: because the three versions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. In his 1987 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare (which uses F1 as the control text), G. R. Hibbard writes &quot;exactly when &quot;Hamlet&quot; was composed depends in part on which &quot;Hamlet&quot; is under consideration, for the play exists in three different forms.&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; was originally written sometime between September 1599 and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). The &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of September 1599 is fixed by a reference to &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (3.2.98–99), the earliest recorded performance of which took place in September 1599. Another important internal piece of evidence is found in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#x27;s report to Hamlet of &quot;an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for&#x27;t&quot; (2.2.335–337). This is probably a reference to the Children of the Chapel, a playing company of young boys who performed at Blackfriars with such success as to make them genuine rivals to the adult acting companies. The subsequent comment, &quot;there has been much to-do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in to the question&quot; (2.2.348–352) is thought to refer to the War of the Theatres between Ben Jonson on one side and John Marston and Thomas Dekker on the other. The conflict began in 1599 when Marston mocked Jonson with the character of Chrisoganus in &quot;Histriomastix&quot;. Jonson responded by satirizing Marston&#x27;s style in &quot;Every Man out of His Humour&quot;, leading to a series of plays in which the various writers mocked one another. The &quot;conflict&quot; concluded in 1601, when Dekker mocked Jonson with the character of Horace in &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, at which point Jonson and Marston apparently reconciled. Both the reference to the child actors and the War of the Theatres suggest a date of composition of 1600–1601. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, Gabriel Harvey has written in a marginal note that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Lucrece&quot; &amp; his &quot;tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke&quot;, have it in them, to please the wiser sort.&quot; Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601. However, not all scholars accept that Harvey&#x27;s note can be used for dating purposes, mainly due to the fact that it implies Thomas Watson (d.1592) and Edmund Spenser (d.1599) are both still alive, but also mentions John Owen&#x27;s 1607 epigrams, making it impossible to ascertain exactly when the note was written. Stylistic evidence has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601, with subsequent revisions up to, and possibly beyond, 1605. This dating, however, is far from universally accepted.

=== &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (1601) ===

:First official record: John Manningham&#x27;s diary on 2 February 1602.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;Twelfe Night, Or what you will&quot;.
:First recorded performance: John Manningham saw the play performed at the Middle Temple on Candlemas (2 February) 1602. The acting company is unrecorded but is thought to have been the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men.
:Evidence: obviously the play was complete by February 1602. However, John Leslie Hotson believes it to have been written earlier, probably in late 1600. On the night of the Feast of the Epiphany (6 January) 1601, it is known the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men performed a play at Whitehall for Queen Elizabeth and Virginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. However, although official records contain much information on the preparations for the play, the name of the play itself is never mentioned. An official description of the unnamed play dictates &quot;that [it] shall be best furnished with rich apparel, have great variety and change of music and dances, and of a subject that may be most pleasing to her Majesty.&quot; Hotson believes the unnamed play of 1601 was &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, the title of which refers to the Twelfth Night celebrations which bridge Christmas and the epiphany. Most scholars disagree with Hotson on this point, however, believing the description could just as easily fit &quot;Much Ado&quot; as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and arguing that rather than Shakespeare naming the character of Orsino in honour of the Duke who would be watching the play, it is more likely he took the name after meeting the Duke prior to writing it. Topical allusions serve only to fix 1599 as a &quot;terminus post quem&quot;. Maria makes reference to &quot;the new map with the augmentation of the Indies&quot; (3.2.74). This probably refers to Edward Wright&#x27;s &quot;Chart of the World on Mercator&#x27;s Projection&quot; in &quot;Certaine Errors in Navigation&quot;, which was published in 1599, or, less likely, to the second edition of Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principall Navigations, Voiages, and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot;, published the same year. Two references to the &quot;sophy&quot; (2.5.170 and 3.4.269) refer to the Shah of Persia, who at the time was Abbas I. In 1599, Sir Anthony Shirley had returned from his travels in Persia, publishing his memoirs in 1600 to great success. This is further evidence of composition around the turn of the century. However, Feste&#x27;s avoidance of the phrase &quot;out of my element&quot; because the word &quot;element&quot; is &quot;overworn&quot; (3.1.58) may be a reference to Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Satiromastix&quot;, which mocks the expression &quot;out of my element&quot; three times. &quot;Satiromastix&quot; was first acted in 1601, meaning, if one accepts the reference, 1601 must be the earliest possible date of composition.

=== &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1600–1602) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by James Roberts on 7 February 1603 as &quot;the booke of Troilus and Cresseda.&quot;
:First published: two different versions of the play were published in quarto in 1609. Q was published under the title &quot;The Historie of Troylus and Cresseida&quot;. Q was published under the title &quot;The Famous Historie of Troylus and Cresseid. Excellently expressing the beginning of their loves, with the conceited wooing of Pandarus, Prince of Licia&quot;. Both Q and Q were printed by George Eld for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley. Both versions of the play are identical apart from a different title page, and a note to the reader added to Q. The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedie of Troylus and Cressida&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; has attained a degree of infamy amongst Shakespearean scholars due to the range of unanswered questions it raises. For example, it is unknown if the play was ever performed in Shakespeare&#x27;s day. Q claims it had been acted by the King&#x27;s Men at the Globe, but Q omits the reference to the King&#x27;s Men and instead includes a note headed &quot;A neuer writer, to an euer reader. Newes,&quot; which claims the play has never been staged. Apparently, when Q was at press, the printers were informed that the play had not been performed and they therefore prepared a cancel title page and the note to the reader, which claims it is a sign of the quality of the play that it has never been publicly staged (&quot;never staled with the stage, never clapper-clewed with the palms of the vulgar&quot;). It is unknown, however, which text is correct – Q or Q. E. A. J. Honigmann has suggested that the play was written early in 1601, but never acted because of fears it may have been seen as a political allegory sympathetic to Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.
:First recorded performance: &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; was never popular on stage, apparently even in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, until the latter half of the twentieth century, when there was an explosion of productions including many that were considered scandalous and highly experimental. The earliest known performance is an adaptation by John Dryden, called &quot;Troilus and Cressida, Or Truth Found Too Late&quot;, which was staged at the Duke&#x27;s Theatre in 1679. Although there is a record of a performance at Smock Alley in Dublin sometime prior to 1700, it is unknown if this production was of Shakespeare&#x27;s original text, or Dryden&#x27;s adaptation, which was being revived as late as 1734. The earliest known production of the Shakespearean text was a heavily edited German language all-male production on 23 April 1898, at the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich. The first known production of the play in the United Kingdom was on 1 June 1907 at the Great Queen Street Theatre, directed by Charles Fry, using a mixture of amateur and professional actors in modern dress.
:Evidence: just as its early performance history is far from clear, so too is the date of the play&#x27;s composition. 1598 can be fixed as a &quot;terminus post quem&quot;, as Shakespeare definitely used George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Seven Books of the Illiad of Homer&quot; as a source, which was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register in April 1598. Some scholars have attempted to link the play to the War of the Theatres, particularly the reference to the &quot;Prologue armed&quot; (l.23), which may be an allusion to the prologue in Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Poetaster&quot; (1601), in which an obviously infuriated Jonson lashes out at his detractors. However, the prologue in &quot;Troilus&quot; was not included in either Q or Q, making it difficult to directly connect it to the squabbles between the playwrights. Stylistic evidence is also inconclusive. A rare word test places it closest to &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test places it after &quot;Henry IV&quot; and before &quot;Othello&quot;, but is unable to determine exactly where the play lies between the two. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after &quot;Hamlet&quot; and before &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Metrical analysis places it after &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; but before &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot;. This all suggests a date of composition of somewhere between 1600 and 1602, but the exact order in which &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; were written seems impossible to determine.

=== &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; (1592–1595; Shakespeare&#x27;s involvement, 1603–1604) ===

:First official record: in the diary of Thomas Hearne, on 17 January 1728. Hearne wrote &quot;On the 12th of Oct. last M Murray lent me a thin folio Paper MS done or sowed up in a Vellum Cover; on w it is intitled, &quot;The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore&quot;. This I have read over. It is wrote in the nature of a Play or Interlude, soon after his death, I believe. Tho&#x27; it appears from thence plainly, what a great, wise, good and charitable man Sir Thomas was, yet there is no particular of History in it, but what we know already. It is the original, being in many places strangely scored &amp; in others so altered that &#x27;tis hard to make some things out.&quot;
:First published: 1844, edited by Alexander Dyce for the Shakespeare Society. Published under the name &quot;Sir Thomas More, A Play; now first printed&quot;.
:Additional information (attribution): that Shakespeare was involved in the composition of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; is now generally agreed upon. The first major scholarly edition of the play was published by Manchester University Press in 1990, under its &quot;Revels Plays&quot; banner, edited by Vittorio Gabrieli and Giorgio Melchiori. In 2011, the Arden Shakespeare also published a full scholarly edition, edited by John Jowett (who had also edited the play for the 2nd edition of the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; in 2005), The Revels Plays edition is subtitled &quot;A play by Anthony Munday and Others. Revised by Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood and William Shakespeare.&quot; The Arden edition includes the subheading &quot;Original Text by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle. Censored by Edmund Tilney. Revisions co-ordinated by Hand C. Revised by Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker, Thomas Heywood and William Shakespeare.&quot; The MS is a foul paper in the handwriting of Anthony Munday. Censorship notes are included throughout by Edmund Tilney, Master of the Revels. Revisions are by Chettle (Hand A), Dekker (Hand E), Heywood (Hand B) and, probably, Shakespeare (Hand D). Hand C is an unknown professional theatrical scribe who made several annotations on top of the alterations. Shakespeare is thought to have worked on Scene 6, based upon handwriting and stylistic analysis. He may also have worked on Scene 8, although this is based purely on stylistic analysis, as Scene 8 exists only in a transcribed version by Hand C. Shakespeare&#x27;s name was first linked to the play by Richard Simpson in 1871. One year later, James Spedding elaborated upon and rejected some of Simpson&#x27;s claims, but ultimately concurred that Hand D was Shakespeare&#x27;s. In 1923, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More&quot; saw a quintet of major scholars (Alfred W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, E. Maunde Thompson, J. Dover Wilson and R. W. Chambers) support the Shakespearean attribution. What is known for certain is that Hand D does bear a striking resemblance to the extant examples of Shakespeare&#x27;s handwriting, and if it is &quot;not&quot; his handwriting, it is not the handwriting of any contemporary playwright whose handwriting has survived. Thus, the vast majority of contemporary paleographers believe that Hand D is that of William Shakespeare.
:First recorded performance: it is unknown if the play was ever performed during Shakespeare&#x27;s day, although due to its censorship problems, it is highly unlikely. The earliest recorded performance occurred at Birkbeck, University of London, in December 1922, where it was performed by the students and produced by members of the English department.
:Evidence: the original play is traditionally believed to have been written sometime between 1592 and 1595 by Munday and Chettle. The early scenes of the play depict &quot;Evil May Day&quot;, the name given to an anti-alien riot in London in May 1517. Anti-alien riots also occurred in 1593 and 1595, followed by the execution of the ringleaders. In the play, Henry VIII is depicted as being relatively merciful to the instigators of the riots, whereas in 1595, Queen Elizabeth showed no such leniency. The theory is that no playwright would have written a play which knowingly portrayed the current monarch in such a negative light when compared to a previous monarch, and as Munday was an occasional government spy, he would be even less likely to do so. This places the date of initial composition as prior to the 1595 executions but probably after the initial re-emergence of xenophobia in the autumn of 1592. Tilney&#x27;s specific objections to the depiction of the riots and their aftermath suggest that he received the play when these issues were still considered sensitive. Due to these censorship issues, the play was probably laid aside until after the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, when Tilney&#x27;s objections would have carried less weight. The revisions were made at this point, although without the participation of Munday. Several aspects of the revision work support a date of 1603–1604. For example, the additions contain twenty-seven profanities forbidden by the Act to Restrain Abuses of Players (1606), making it highly unlikely they were added after this date. There are also three references in Chettle&#x27;s revision work to the court (Sc.13.64), the King (Sc.13.78–80) and &quot;Lord Spend-All&#x27;s Stuart&#x27;s&quot; (Sc.13.110) which are probably references to James I, who came to power in 1603. There are also several parallels with Chettle&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Hoffman&quot; (written between 1602 and 1604). Stylistic analysis of Scene 6 also supports this date. MacDonald P. Jackson&#x27;s examination of vocabulary and pauses-in-verse place the material between &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;.

=== &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1603–1604) ===
:First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 26 December 1604 of &quot;Mesur for Mesur&quot; by &quot;Shaxberd.&quot;
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 26 December 1604, by the King&#x27;s Men.
:Evidence: obviously the play was written prior to December 1604. Internal evidence in the form of topical allusions suggest a date of 1603–1604. For example, 1.1.68–73 may allude to King James&#x27;s dislike of crowds, which had become apparent in June 1603. Another example is found at 4.3.8 (&quot;the old women were all dead&quot;). This is thought to refer to the plague sweeping London, which had become a significant problem in May 1603. In 1.2, Lucio discusses with two gentlemen the possibility of an imminent peace, which would deprive soldiers of their occupation, followed immediately by a reference to a &quot;sanctimonious pirate&quot; (1.2.1–7). This may refer to King James&#x27;s attempts in the summer of 1604 to negotiate a peace treaty with Spain, which would greatly reduce the activities of pirates. If these allusions are accurate, it would place the date of composition as somewhere between summer 1603 and late 1604. This date is supported by stylistic analysis. Both a colloquialism-in-verse test and a metrical test place &quot;Measure&quot; after &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Troilus&quot;, but before &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot;, and a rare word test links it most closely to &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot;.

=== &quot;Othello&quot; (1603–1604) ===

:First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1604 of &quot;The Moor of Venis&quot; by &quot;Shaxberd.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1622 as &quot;The Tragœdy of Othello, The Moore of Venice&quot; (printed by Nicholas Okes for Thomas Walkley). The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under virtually the same name; &quot;The Tragedie of Othello, the Moore of Venice&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): although the 1622 quarto text is not usually considered a bad quarto, it does differ significantly from the &quot;Folio&quot; text; F1 features roughly 160 lines not in Q1, and Q1 features twelve lines not in F1. The word ordering in some sentences is also different at several points throughout the play. In his 2001 edition of Q1 for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series, Scott McMillin argues the quarto was created by a professional theatrical scribe listening to the actors performing the play, and in this sense, it represents as pure a performance text as it is possible to have.
:First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1604, by the King&#x27;s Men.
:Evidence: obviously the play was written by November 1604, and conventionally, it tends to be dated 1603–1604. An important element in this dating is Shakespeare&#x27;s use of sources. For example, &quot;burn like the mines of sulphur&quot; (3.3.331), &quot;one entire and perfect chrysolite&quot; (5.2.143), and &quot;Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees/Their medicinal gum (5.2.349–350) are all thought to allude to Philemon Holland&#x27;s translation of Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Naturalus Historia&quot;, published in 1601. Additionally, Shakespeare probably took the information regarding the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (found in 1.3, 2.1 and 2.2) from Richard Knolles&#x27;s &quot;General History of the Turks&quot;, which contains an epistle dated 30 September 1603. Specifically, he may have got the name Signor Angelo, mentioned in the sailor&#x27;s report (1.3.16), from Angelus Sorianus, a Venetian commander discussed in Knolles. Also, the sailor&#x27;s description of Turkish tactics, &quot;The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,/Steering with due course toward the island of Rhodes,/Have there injoined with an after fleet&quot; (1.3.34–36), may have come from Knolles&#x27;s description of the Turkish fleets&#x27; actions prior to the siege of Nicosia. This suggests September 1603 as a likely &quot;terminus post quem&quot;. A possible &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; could be March 1604, when Philip Henslowe paid Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton for Part 1 of &quot;The Honest Whore&quot;, which contains the line &quot;more savage than a barbarous Moor.&quot; Whilst not specific enough to be a definite reference to Shakespeare, it is known that &quot;Othello&quot; was immensely popular from its very inception, and such a reference would certainly have made sense to an audience at the time. It has also been argued that the play may have been written with an eye to pleasing the new king, James I. James was interested in Turkish history, and had written a poem in 1591 about the Battle of Lepanto. The poem was republished upon his accession in 1603, and a play set amongst the events which ultimately led to that battle would have had a special interest for the king. This would also support a date of 1603–1604. However, following H. C. Hart&#x27;s 1928 edition of the play for the first series of the Arden Shakespeare, E. A. J. Honigmann dates the play mid-1601 to mid-1602, believing it to have influenced the bad quarto of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (in existence by July 1602). For example, he cites the substitution of the name &quot;Montano&quot; for &quot;Reynaldo.&quot; Montano occurs in no other play except &quot;Othello&quot;, and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on &quot;Hamlet&quot; Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of &quot;Othello&quot;, and unconsciously mixed up the names. Additionally, MacDonald P. Jackson&#x27;s pause analysis of the plays places &quot;Othello&quot; closest to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, in that order. The &quot;average date&quot; for these four plays is 1602. In his 2006 Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play, however, Michael Neill discusses Honigmann and Jackson&#x27;s arguments, finding them suggestive, but not wholly persuasive, and ultimately settling for a &quot;compromise date&quot; of 1602–1603.

=== &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; (1604–1605) ===

:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register entry for the &quot;First Folio&quot; on 8 November 1623.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: at Goodman&#x27;s Fields in 1741, billed as &quot;written by Shakespeare and not acted since his time.&quot;
:Evidence: a notoriously difficult play to date, with estimates ranging from 1595 to 1607. As an example of the disparity the play can cause in relation to its date, the 1997 revised edition of &quot;William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion&quot; from Oxford University Press dates the play 1604–1605, placing it between &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;. However, the 2nd edition of the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; in 2005, compiled by the same editors as the &quot;Textual Companion&quot;, date it 1606–1607, placing it between &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;. Another example of scholarly mutability regarding the date of &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot; is Edmond Malone. In his 1778 chronology, Malone had accepted a theory originated by Thomas Percy and advanced by Richard Farmer that &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot; was &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;, and so dated the play 1598. However, by the time of his death, Malone had changed his mind, and in the &quot;Third Variorum&quot; edition of 1821, edited by James Boswell based on Malone&#x27;s notes, he dated it 1606, based on a stylistic analysis of the anti-Puritan satire in 1.3, which he believed was written for King James&#x27;s amusement. Another scholar who has attempted to tackle the dating issues is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1813, he formulated the theory that the play &quot;as it has come down to us, was written at two different, and rather distinct periods of the poet&#x27;s life.&quot; Further elaborated upon by John Payne Collier, this theory was widely accepted throughout the nineteenth century, with most scholars arguing for an initial period of composition in the mid-1590s and a second period in the mid-1600s. The basis of the argument was that although the play exhibited stylistic and thematic connections with &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, certain sections were seen as immature, and more akin to the type of material found in &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;, &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; or &quot;Comedy of Errors&quot;. Often cited as immature were Helen&#x27;s discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the rhyming couplets in 2.1 and 2.2. Similarly, Parolles was seen by some as an early study for Falstaff, and the Clown was often seen as being similar to Launce in &quot;Two Gentlemen&quot;; amusing, but not integrated into the plot particularly well. Modern scholarship, however, which tends to see the play as more complex and serious than earlier scholars, has rejected the two-periods-of-composition theory. Topical allusions in the play are sparse at best, with the only allusion recognised by most scholars being 1.3.94–95 (&quot;wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart&quot;), which is thought to be a reference to the enforcement of the surplice in 1604. Stylistically, a rare word test links the play most closely with &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after &quot;Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; but before &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;. A metrical test places it after &quot;Measure&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; but before &quot;Lear&quot;. If one accepts the surplice reference, in tandem with the stylistic evidence, a date of 1604–1605 seems likely, but the exact order of composition of plays in this period remains open to speculation.

=== &quot;King Lear&quot; (1605–1606) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Nathaniel Butter and John Busby on 26 November 1607 as &quot;A booke called. M William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear.&quot;
:First published: version of the play published in quarto in 1608 as &quot;M. William Shakspeare: His True Chronicle Historie of the life and death of King Lear and his three Daughters. With the unfortunate life of Edgar, sonne and heire to the Earle of Gloster, and his sullen and assumed humor of Tom of Bedlam&quot; (printed by Nicholas Okes for Nathaniel Butter). This text was republished in 1619, as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot; (printed by Thomas Pavier). The 1623 &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedie of King Lear&quot;.
:Additional information (publication): although the 1608 quarto text is not usually considered a bad quarto &quot;per se&quot;, it does differ substantially from the &quot;Folio&quot; text; Q1 contains 285 lines not in F1, and F1 contains about 115 lines not in Q1. Additionally, over one thousand individual words are different between the two texts, each text has completely different punctuation, much of the verse in F1 is printed as prose in Q1, several speeches are given to different characters (including the final speech of the play – Albany in Q1, Edgar in F1) and each text features different scene divisions. The New Cambridge Shakespeare has published scholarly editions of both texts; F1 in 1992, and Q1 in 1994 as part of their Early Quartos series, both versions edited by Jay L. Halio. The 1999 Pelican Shakespeare edition of the play, edited by Stephen Orgel included both Q1 and F1, as well as the conflated text originally created by Alexander Pope in 1725. Similarly, the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; also included both versions of the play in their second edition of 2005, each edited by Gary Taylor. The Q1 text appears under the title &quot;The History of King Lear&quot;, and is dated 1605–1606. The &quot;Folio&quot; text appears under the title &quot;The Tragedy of King Lear&quot; and is dated 1610. Taylor believes Q1 represents an early draft of the play, written prior to performance, and F1 represents a revision written four or five years later, after numerous performances. He feels the differences in the two texts represent a &quot;more theatrical&quot; version of the play, which streamlines the plot and improves the characterisation of Edgar, at the expense of Kent and Albany. Although Halio disagrees with Taylor&#x27;s assessment of F1 as &quot;more theatrical,&quot; he reaches the same conclusion regarding the provenance of the text; Q1 was probably set from Shakespeare&#x27;s foul papers, whilst F1 represents a performance text, probably altered by Shakespeare himself. Most scholars today are in agreement with this theory.
:First recorded performance: according to the entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register in November 1607, the play was performed at Whitehall on 26 December 1606.

:Evidence: although the existence of two distinct texts complicates the issue of dating the play, what is known for certain is that it must have been completed (in some form) by December 1606. The play could not have been written any earlier than March 1603, as determined by Shakespeare&#x27;s use of Samuel Harsnett&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&quot;, from which he took some of Tom O&#x27;Bedlam&#x27;s dialogue, which was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 16 March 1603. However, the &quot;terminus post quem&quot; can possibly be pushed forward to 1605. Gary Taylor believes that &quot;Lear&quot; was influenced by George Chapman, Ben Jonson and John Marston&#x27;s &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;, written in early 1605, and George Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;The Miseries of Enforced Marriage&quot;, written no later than mid-1605. Furthermore, the line &quot;these late eclipses in the sun and moon&quot; (Sc.2.101) could refer to the lunar eclipse of 17 September and the solar eclipse of 2 October 1605. Of vital importance in dating the play, however, is the 1605 publication of an older version of the story, the anonymous play &quot;The true Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan and Cordella&quot;. The publication of &quot;Leir&quot; in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Lear&quot; was on stage by 1605. &quot;Leir&quot; was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to &quot;c.&quot;1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare&#x27;s newly released play. On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, R. A. Foakes argues the 1605 publication of &quot;Leir&quot; inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used &quot;Leir&quot; as a source, and Foakes believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare&#x27;s remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 &quot;Leir&quot; to &quot;alert&quot; readers to the fact that Shakespeare&#x27;s version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in &quot;Leir&quot;, and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare&#x27;s version of the story is more complex than &quot;Leir&quot;. If Foakes is correct, it means Shakespeare could not have started writing &quot;Lear&quot; until May 1605. In his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, however, Stanley Wells argues there are echoes of &quot;Leir&quot; in plays as chronologically wide-ranging as &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Richard II&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, suggesting Shakespeare was very familiar with the play from at least the early 1590s. The publication of &quot;Leir&quot; in 1605 could also be connected to the case of Brian Annesley, a wealthy Kentishman, who may, or may not, have influenced Shakespeare in writing &quot;Lear&quot;. In 1603, Annesley&#x27;s eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley&#x27;s youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, for help, and successfully blocked Grace&#x27;s plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604–1606. Whatever the case regarding &quot;Leir&quot; and Annesley, however, Halio, Foakes, and Wells all date the initial composition of the play to 1605–1606. In regards to the revision of the text, stylistic analysis tends to view Q1 and F1 as two distinct texts, and in this sense, a rare word test, pause test and metrical test of Q1 all place it between &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and either immediately before or immediately after &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;. A rare word test of the passages unique to F1, however, place it closest to &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Henry VIII&quot;.

=== &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1605–1606) ===

:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register entry for the &quot;First Folio&quot;, on 8 November 1623.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Life of Tymon of Athens&quot;.
:First recorded performance: there is no known evidence of a performance in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime. The earliest known production of the play was in 1674, when Thomas Shadwell wrote an adaptation under the title &quot;The History of Timon of Athens, The Man-hater&quot;. Multiple other adaptations followed over the next century, by writers such as Thomas Hull, James Love and Richard Cumberland. Although the earliest known performance of the straight Shakespearean text was at Smock Alley in Dublin in 1761, adaptations continued to dominate the stage until well into the twentieth century. The earliest known production of a predominantly Shakespearean version of the play in the United Kingdom was at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1851. Adapted by Samuel Phelps, the production cut all scenes involving the Fool, the return of the Poet and the Painter and much of the sexual material. He also changed the ending, having a solemn Alcibiades marching to Timon&#x27;s grave and reading the epitaph himself, a far less ambiguous ending than the original.
:Additional information (attribution): dating &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; is rendered more difficult because of the probable involvement of Thomas Middleton. The play contains several narrative inconsistencies uncharacteristic of Shakespeare, an unusually unsatisfying &quot;dénouement&quot;, drastically different styles in different places and an unusually large number of long lines which don&#x27;t scan. One theory is that the play as it appears in the &quot;First Folio&quot; is unfinished. E. K. Chambers believes Shakespeare began the play, but abandoned it due to a mental breakdown, never returning to finish it. F. W. Brownlow believes the play to have been Shakespeare&#x27;s last, and remained uncompleted at his death. A more predominant theory, however, is one proposed by Charles Knight in 1838: the play was a collaboration between Shakespeare and at least one other dramatist. Today, many scholars believe that other dramatist was Thomas Middleton. However, the exact nature of the collaboration is disputed. Did Middleton revise a piece begun by Shakespeare, did Shakespeare revise Middleton&#x27;s work, or did they work together? John Jowett, editor of the play for both the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; and the individual Oxford Shakespeare edition, believes Middleton worked with Shakespeare in an understudy capacity and wrote scenes 2 (1.2 in editions which divide the play into acts), 5 (3.1), 6 (3.2), 7 (3.3), 8 (3.4), 9 (3.5), 10 (3.6) and the last eighty lines of 14 (4.3).
:Evidence: because there is no reference to &quot;Timon&quot; until 1623, attempts to date the play must rely on topical allusions and stylistic analysis. A possible &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the &quot;Folio&quot; text is an important factor in determining a date. The King&#x27;s Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. &quot;Timon&quot; is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608. A &quot;terminus post quem&quot; may come from a possible topical allusion to the Gunpowder Plot of November 1605; &quot;those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire&quot; (Sc.7.32–33). In the context of the play, the line is referring to religious zeal, but some scholars feel it is a subtle reference to the events of November. The play may also have been influenced by a pamphlet published in June 1605, &quot;Two Unnatural and Bloody Murders&quot;, which served as the primary source for Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot;. This would narrow the possible range of dates to sometime between November 1605 and August 1608. Narrowing the date further, however, must come wholly from stylistic analysis. A metrical test links the play most closely with &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;, whilst a colloquialism-in-verse test places it after &quot;All&#x27;s Well&quot; but before &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Furthermore, MacDonald P. Jackson&#x27;s rare word test found the conjectured Shakespearean parts of the text date to 1605–1606. However, if one were to analyse the conjectured non-Shakespearean sections as if they were by Shakespeare, the rare word test produces a date of 1594–1595, an obvious impossibility. Going further, Jackson found that if one examines the non-Shakespearean sections in the context of Middleton&#x27;s career, a date of 1605–1606 also results.

=== &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606) ===

:First official record: in his notes for a book on &quot;Common Policy&quot; (i.e. public morals), Simon Forman records seeing the play at the Globe on 20 April 1611. He actually dates the performance &quot;1610, the 20th April, Saturday,&quot; but in 1610, 20 April was a Tuesday, and most scholars feel he accidentally wrote the wrong year.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Tragedie of Macbeth&quot;.
:First recorded performance: possibly on 20 April 1611 at the Globe, recorded by Simon Forman. However, there is some doubt amongst scholars as to the veracity of Forman&#x27;s account. Initially, the document itself was thought to be a forgery, as it was first brought to light by John Payne Collier amongst a group of documents many of which did prove to be inauthentic. Although J. Dover Wilson proved the document was genuine in 1947, doubts remain as to the reliability of Forman&#x27;s report. For example, he makes no mention of the apparitions, or of Hecate, and he virtually ignores the conclusion of the play, which is strange considering he was taking notes for a book about morals. He also mentions seeing Macbeth and Banquo on horseback riding through a wood, something highly unlikely on the Globe stage. Furthermore, he describes the Weïrd Sisters as &quot;nymphs or fairies,&quot; an unusual way to describe the characters as they appear in the play. However, &quot;nymphs&quot; is how they are described in one of Shakespeare&#x27;s sources for &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;. This suggests Forman may have conflated witnessing a performance with reading the source material. If Forman&#x27;s account is not accepted as genuine, the first recorded performance was on 5 November 1664, as recorded by Samuel Pepys.
:Additional information (revision): because it is theorised by some scholars that the &quot;Folio&quot; text of &quot;Macbeth&quot; shows signs of revision, dating the play can be difficult. &quot;Macbeth&quot; is extremely short for a Shakespearean tragedy, and it is thought that F1 may have been set from a prompt book that had been shortened for performance, rather than from Shakespeare&#x27;s own foul papers. First suggested by W. G. Clarke and W. A. Wright in their 1869 edition of the play for Clarendon Press, the most likely person to have carried out the revision is Thomas Middleton. The play is listed in the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; as &quot;&quot;The Tragedy of Macbeth&quot; by William Shakespeare, Adapted by Thomas Middleton,&quot; and its date is recorded as &quot;1606; adapted 1616.&quot; Middleton is conjectured to have written 3.5 and much of 4.1; the only scenes which feature Hecate. The nature of these scenes suggest revision as opposed to collaboration. The main reason Middleton&#x27;s name is attached to the conjectured revision is because 4.1 calls for the use of two songs from &quot;The Witch&quot;, a play by Middleton himself. However, Middleton&#x27;s involvement with the play, and the notion of revision work itself, is not universally accepted. Two notable scholars who dissent from this theory are Jonathan Hope and Brian Vickers.
:Evidence: the play is closely connected to King James, and scholars are in general agreement that it is unlikely to have been written prior to his accession in 1603. He considered Banquo his direct ancestor, and eight Stuart kings preceded James, just as Banquo is depicted at the end of &quot;a show of eight kings&quot; (4.1.126.1–2). In 1790, Edmond Malone dated the play 1606, and the majority of scholars still accept this date even whilst acknowledging little conclusive evidence exists, other than the fact that it &#x27;seems&#x27; correct in the context of Shakespeare&#x27;s other work of the period. There are some possible topical allusions, however, which do support a date of 1606. For example, the Porter&#x27;s mention of &quot;an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale&quot; (2.3.7–9) is a possible reference to the Gunpowder plot, specifically the trial of Henry Garnet in March 1606. Furthermore, the Weïrd Sisters&#x27; account of &quot;The Tiger&quot; (1.3.8–26) is thought to allude to a ship of the same name that returned to England on 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. At 1.3.22–23, the First Witch says &quot;Weary sev&#x27;n-nights, nine times nine,/Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine.&quot; The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion. If this theory is correct, the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606. In his 1997 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, however, A. R. Braunmuller finds the arguments for topical allusions inconclusive and instead argues for a date closer to James&#x27;s accession in 1603. From a stylistic perspective, a metrical test and colloquialism-in-verse test place the play after &quot;Lear&quot; and &quot;Timon&quot; but before &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, although Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test places it before all three plays. A rare word test places it closest to &quot;Troilus&quot; and &quot;Lear&quot;.

=== &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; (1606) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Edward Blount on 20 May 1608 as &quot;a booke Called Anthony. and Cleopatra.&quot; Jointly entered with &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra&quot;.
:First recorded performance: in 1669 the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office granted the right to perform the play to Thomas Killigrew, with the added note that it had been &quot;formerly acted at the Blackfriars,&quot; but no further information is given. The earliest definite performance was in 1759 when it was staged by David Garrick at Drury Lane, from a script prepared by Edward Capell. However, this production was heavily influenced by John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;All for Love&quot;, which, along with Charles Sedley&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; had dominated the stage from 1677 onwards. Different adaptations were staged by John Philip Kemble at Covent Garden in 1813, William Macready at Drury Lane in 1833, Samuel Phelps at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1849, Andrew Halliday at Drury Lane in 1873, and Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1906. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean text was in a production by Robert Atkins at The Old Vic in 1922.
:Evidence: obviously, the play was written by May 1608. However, an earlier &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; can perhaps be established by Samuel Daniel&#x27;s republication of his play &quot;The Tragedie of Cleopatra&quot; (originally written in 1594) in a &quot;newly altered version,&quot; which seems to have been influenced by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot;. For example, Daniel includes a newly added allusion to &quot;Cydnus&quot; as the meeting place of the lovers, adds the characters of Dircetus, Diomedes and Gallus, and includes several verbal echoes. If the play was an influence on Daniel then it must have been on stage by Easter 1607, due to the closing of the theatres because of plague. This suggests it was written in 1606 or very early 1607. That 1606 is the most likely date seems fixed by Barnabe Barnes&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Charter&quot;, acted by the King&#x27;s Men on 2 February 1607. Barnes refers to &quot;aspics,&quot; which are used to kill two young princes in their sleep, as &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s birds,&quot; and the princes as &quot;competitors with Cleopatra.&quot; If Barnes is here alluding to &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot;, in which Cleopatra kills herself by making an asp bite her on the breast and arm (5.2.302–312), it must have been on stage by January 1607 at the very latest, suggesting composition in 1606.

=== &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; (1607–1608) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Edward Blount on 20 May 1608 as &quot;A booke called. The booke of Pericles prynce of Tyre.&quot; Jointly entered with &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.
:First published: published in quarto in 1609 as &quot;The Late and much admired Play, Called Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of the whole History, adventures, and fortunes of the sayd Prince: As also, The no lesse strange, and worthy accidents, in the Birth and Life, of his Daughter Mariana&quot; (printed by William White and Thomas Creede for Henry Gosson). This text was republished in 1609 (again by White and Creede for Gosson), 1611 (by Simon Stafford for Gosson) 1619 (as part of William Jaggard&#x27;s &quot;False Folio&quot;, printed by Thomas Pavier), 1630 (by John Norton for Robert Bird) and 1635 (by Thomas Cotes for Robert Bird). &quot;Pericles&quot; did not appear in the &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), the &quot;Second Folio&quot; (1632) or the first impression of the &quot;Third Folio&quot; (1663). It was added to the second impression of the &quot;Third Folio&quot; (1664; printed by Coates for Philip Chetwinde) as &quot;The much admired Play, called, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of the whole History, Adventures, and Fortunes of the sayd Prince&quot;.
:First recorded performance: the Venetian ambassador to England from 5 January 1606 to 23 November 1608, Zorzi Giustinian, saw a production of the play during his time in London. He was accompanied by the French ambassador, Antoine Lefèvre de la Boderie, and his wife, who arrived in England in April 1607. Giustinian noted that he paid admission, so the play must have been public. As the theatres were closed from April to December 1607 and from July to November 1608, he must have seen the play sometime between January and June 1608. The earliest known datable production was at the manor house of Sir John Yorke, Gouthwaite Hall in North Yorkshire, on 2 February 1610, performed by the Cholmley Players. Information concerning the production comes from a case in the Court of Star Chamber taken against the Catholic Yorke by his Puritan neighbour Sir Stephen Proctor.
:Additional information (attribution): as the play was not included in the &quot;First Folio&quot;, there has always been doubt as to whether or not Shakespeare actually wrote it. The second impression of the &quot;Third Folio&quot; added seven new plays, six of which have been proven to be part of the Shakespeare Apocrypha; &quot;Locrine&quot;, &quot;The London Prodigal&quot;, &quot;The Puritan&quot;, &quot;Sir John Oldcastle&quot;, &quot;Thomas Lord Cromwell&quot;, and &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot;. Traditionally, for some scholars, the simple fact that &quot;Pericles&quot; is included with such a group is proof enough that Shakespeare did not write it. In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably George Wilkins. Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s &quot;The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare&quot;), the theory of Wilkins&#x27;s involvement originated in 1868, suggested by Nicolaus Delius. Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius&#x27;s original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1–9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10–22. However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction, there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction. On the other hand, in his 2002 book &quot;Shakespeare, Co-Author&quot;, Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond&#x27;s analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty. Similarly, in the 2003 book, &quot;Defining Shakespeare&quot;, MacDonald P. Jackson analyses, amongst other aspects, versification, rhyme, function words, pronoun usage, metrical patterns and elisions. He too is especially critical of Delvecchio and Hammond, and he too concludes that Wilkins&#x27;s status as co-author is virtually certain.
:Evidence: in 1608, Wilkins published a prose version of the story called &quot;The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre, Being the True History of the Play of Pericles, as it was lately presented by the worthy and ancient poet John Gower&quot;, which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines from the play, suggesting work on the play preceded composition of the prose version. In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins&#x27;s prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins&#x27;s prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren&#x27;s 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot; (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607–1608. A rare word test of scenes 10–22 place them closest to &quot;The Tempest&quot;, whereas a rare word test of scenes 1–9 place them closest to &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;. If Shakespeare wrote 10–22, the proximity to &quot;The Tempest&quot; makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1–9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of &quot;1 Henry IV&quot;, Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test places scenes 10–22 closest to &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers&#x27; Register entry, Wilkins&#x27;s 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.

=== &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1608) ===

:First official record: mentioned in the Stationers&#x27; Register entry for the &quot;First Folio&quot;, on 8 November 1623.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Tragedy of Coriolanus&quot;.
:First recorded performance: the earliest known production of the play was a 1681 adaptation by Nahum Tate performed at Drury Lane. Called &quot;The Ingratitude of a Commonwealth; or, The Fall of Coriolanus&quot;, the play was specifically written to protest the anti-Catholic riots which arose in response to the &quot;Popish Plot&quot; to assassinate Charles II. In 1719, John Dennis adapted the play, again into a political protest piece staged at Drury Lane. &quot;The Invader of His Country; or, The Fatal Resentment&quot; was written in response to the Jacobite rising of 1715. More adaptations followed; James Thomson&#x27;s 1747 version &quot;Coriolanus: A Tragedy&quot; was performed at Covent Garden in protest against the Jacobite rising of 1745, and Thomas Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus: The Roman Matron&quot;, which combined Shakespeare&#x27;s original with Thomson&#x27;s version and was performed at Smock Alley in Dublin in 1752. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean text was on 11 November 1754, when David Garrick staged an abridged production at Drury Lane.
:Evidence: the play must have been written between 1605 and 1609. A &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of 1605 is fixed by Menenius&#x27;s speech regarding the body politic (1.1.93–152), which is partly derived from a speech attributed to Pope Adrian IV in William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Remaines of a Greater Worke, Concerning Britaine&quot;, which was published in 1605. A &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of 1609 can be fixed by Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicœne, or The silent woman&quot;, which mocks the line &quot;he lurched all swords of the garland&quot; (2.2.99), and Robert Armin&#x27;s &quot;Phantasma the Italian Tailor and his Boy&quot;, which contains a close parallel to the line &quot;they threw their caps/As they would hang them on the horns o&#x27;th&#x27;moon&quot; (1.1.209–210). &quot;Epicœne&quot; was written in 1609, and &quot;Phantasma&quot; was entered into the Stationers Register on 6 February 1609. Topical allusions, however, can be used to narrow the date further. For example, the presentation of the grain riots is strikingly reminiscent of the Midlands corn riots of 1607. Perhaps significantly, Shakespeare was in Stratford-upon-Avon for much of autumn 1608, organising his mother&#x27;s funeral and conducting business, and thus would have been close to the origin point of the unrest. The reference to &quot;the coal of fire upon the ice&quot; (1.1.170) is a possible allusion to the winter of 1607–08, when the frost was so severe that vendors set up booths on the frozen Thames river, and pans of coals were placed on the ice so that pedestrians could warm themselves. Also, an allusion to the complaints about Hugh Myddelton&#x27;s project to bring clean water to London from the River Lea (which originated in 1608) has been detected in Martius&#x27;s warning to the patricians &quot;to say he&#x27;ll turn your current in a ditch/And make your channel his&quot; (3.1.98–9). Gary Taylor also finds the use of act divisions in the &quot;Folio&quot; text important, as the King&#x27;s Men only began to use act divisions when they occupied the indoors Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608. Lee Bliss argues that the five-act structure is built into the thematic fabric of the play, further strengthening the argument that it was written for Blackfriars. Indeed, Bliss believes &quot;Coriolanus&quot; may have been the King&#x27;s Men&#x27;s debut play at the theatre. Taylor believes that the cumulative internal evidence all points to a composition date of no earlier than spring 1608. In his 1994 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, R. B. Parker dates the play to mid-1608. In his 2000 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Lee Bliss is unconvinced by the arguments that Shakespeare is referring to the freezing of the Thames or to Myddelton&#x27;s scheme, and settles on a date of late 1608 to early 1609.

=== &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1609–1611) ===
:First official record: in his journal, Simon Forman recorded seeing a performance of the play at the Globe on 15 May 1611.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: a production of the play by the King&#x27;s Men was staged at the Globe on 15 May 1611, as recorded by Simon Forman.
:Evidence: &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; can be a difficult play to date precisely due to a lack of contemporary references and topical allusions. Aside from the Forman reference (and some subsequent dated productions at court), and a possible allusion to a Ben Jonson piece, the play must be dated using stylistic analysis. The possible Jonson reference occurs during the sheep-shearing feast, when twelve countrymen perform a satyrs&#x27; dance that three are said to have already &quot;danced before the King&quot; (4.4.333). This may be an allusion to Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;Oberon, the Faery Prince&quot;, which was performed at court on 1 January 1611. This would place the most likely date of composition sometime in mid-1610. However, not all scholars believe the reference need be taken that literally, and even those that do accept the Jonson allusion, such as Stanley Wells (editor of the play for the &quot;Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works&quot;), agree that the passage may have been added at a later date, and is therefore of little use in dating the play. Traditionally, the play is paired with &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in terms of style, theme and tone, with &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; seen as the superior play, and therefore the later of the two. However, stylistic analysis would suggest &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; preceded &quot;Cymbeline&quot;; a rare word test places it closest to &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, Ants Oras pause test places it closest to &quot;Pericles&quot;, a colloquialism-in-verse test places it after &quot;Coriolanus&quot; but before &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, a metrical test places it closest to &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. In his 2010 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, John Pitcher argues for a date of late 1610 – early 1611, believing Shakespeare wrote &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot; in this period after the reopening of the theatres in early 1611, although he acknowledges this creates a gap in the chronology which would suggest Shakespeare wrote nothing in 1609.

=== &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (1610) ===

:First official record: Simon Forman saw a production on an unspecified date in 1611. It is thought he saw the play not long before he died, on 8 September of that year.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Tragedie of Cymbeline&quot;.
:First recorded performance: Simon Forman saw the play in 1611, although the date (and location) is unknown. The earliest known datable performance was on 1 January 1634, when the play was performed at court for Charles I and Henrietta Maria, where it was described as &quot;well likte by the kinge.&quot;
:Evidence: obviously, the play was complete by September 1611. A &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of 1608 can be fixed with reasonable certainty insofar as the spectacular stage direction in 5.3, when &quot;Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle,&quot; suggests Shakespeare wrote the play with the indoor stage equipment of Blackfriars in mind, which places the date as after August 1608. The play also has connections with two other plays of the period; Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding&quot; and Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. &quot;Philaster&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot; have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, they must have seen it in performance. But the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. &quot;Philaster&quot; was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if &quot;Philaster&quot; was influenced by &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, it must have been written in the first half of 1610. But this contradicts Andrew Gurr&#x27;s evidence that &quot;Philaster&quot; was written in late 1609. On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the &quot;Philaster&quot; MS, making it more likely that &quot;Philaster&quot; preceded &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. If Gurr&#x27;s late 1609 date for &quot;Philaster&quot; is correct, this would suggest Shakespeare wrote &quot;Cymbeline&quot; in 1610. The play is also connected to Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, which, like &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, features Jupiter descending on a cloud, as well as some tentative verbal parallels. As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare&#x27;s work, the likely explanation here is that &quot;Cymbeline&quot; preceded &quot;Golden Age&quot;. But the date of &quot;Golden Age&quot; is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610. If one accepts this date, it suggests a date of mid-1610 for &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Further evidence for 1610 is presented by Roger Warren, in his 1998 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare. Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the investiture of James&#x27;s eldest son Henry as Prince of Wales, which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels&#x27;s &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;, which foregrounded Milford Haven as the &quot;port of union&quot; where Henry&#x27;s ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III. Milford is similarly foregrounded in &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, which also deals with the iconography and cultural significance of Welshness, providing a correlation between the geography of the play and the politics of the period. In his 2005 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Martin Butler, citing much of the same evidence as Warren (although he is unconvinced by the connection with &quot;Golden Age&quot;), agrees with a date of mid-1610.

=== &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1610–1611) ===
:First official record: an entry in the Revels Account Book records a performance on 1 November 1611.
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623).
:First recorded performance: in the banqueting hall at Whitehall Palace on 1 November 1611, performed by the King&#x27;s Men.
:Evidence: the date of &quot;The Tempest&quot; can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The &quot;terminus post quem&quot; of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare&#x27;s use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for Virginia, carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda. All hands were thought lost, but on 23 May 1610 her passengers arrived safely in Virginia, having found shelter on Bermuda, where they repaired the pinnaces and completed their journey. The play is particularly indebted to William Strachey&#x27;s &quot;A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates&quot;, written in Virginia, and dated 15 July. The MS was carried back to England by Gates himself, who arrived in London in early September. Although &quot;True Reportory&quot; was not published until 1625, it is known to have been read widely in MS form. Two pamphlets published later in 1610 were also used as sources; Sylvester Jourdain&#x27;s &quot;A Discovery of the Bermudas&quot;, the dedication of which is dated 13 October 1610, and the Virginia Company&#x27;s own &quot;A True Declaration of the Estate of the Colonie in Virginia&quot;, which was entered into the Stationers Register on 8 November. It is worth noting that although most scholars accept these texts as sources and evidence of dating, not all do so. Kenneth Muir is a notable example of a scholar who questions the argument that Shakespeare used Strachey. Stylistically, a rare vocabulary test, a colloquialism-in-verse test and Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test all place the play after &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;.

=== &quot;Cardenio&quot; (1612–1613) ===

:First official record: entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register by Humphrey Moseley on 9 September 1653, as &quot;The History of Cardenio, by Mr Fletcher and Shakespeare.&quot;
:First published: as far as is known, &quot;Cardenio&quot; itself has never been published, but in 1728 Lewis Theobald published a play called &quot;Double Falshood; or, The Distrest Lovers&quot;, which he claimed was adapted from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cardenio&quot;. Theobald claimed that he had access to the original play in the form of three manuscripts. The play had been staged at Drury Lane in December 1727, to great box office success, and was revived in 1728. According to an article in the &quot;Gazetteer&quot; on 31 March 1770, &quot;the original Manuscript of this play is now treasured up in the Museum of Covent Garden Playhouse.&quot; However, the article is unclear on whether it is referring to the original &quot;Cardenio&quot; manuscript by Shakespeare and Fletcher or the original &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; script by Theobald. In any case, the library burned down in 1808. Theobald&#x27;s 1728 publication contains a preface which reads, in part, &quot;It has been alleged as incredible, that such a curiosity should be stifled and lost to the world for above a century. To this my answer is short: that though it never till now made its appearance on the stage, yet one of the manuscript copies which I have is of above sixty years standing, in the handwriting of Mr. Downes the famous old prompter; and, as I am credibly informed, was early in the possession of the celebrated Mr. Betterton and by him designed to have been ushered into the world. What accident prevented this purpose of his, I do not pretend to know; or through what hands it had successively passed before that period of time. There is a tradition (which I have from the noble person, who supplied me with one of my copies) that it was given by our author, as a present of value, to a natural daughter of his, for whose sake he wrote it, in the time of his retirement from the stage. Two other copies I have (one of which I was glad to purchase at a very good rate), which may not, perhaps, be quite so old as the former; but one of them is much more perfect, and has fewer flaws and interruptions in the sense.&quot;
:First recorded performance: on 20 May 1613, the King&#x27;s Company received payment for a court performance of &quot;&quot;Cardenno&quot;.&quot; The precise date of this court performance is not known, but it is most likely to have occurred between 9–21 February 1613.
:Additional information (attribution): &quot;Cardenio&quot; is considered a lost play, and whether or not Shakespeare had anything to do with it is an unanswered (and, given the available evidence, perhaps unanswerable) question. Only two sources attribute it to Shakespeare; Moseley&#x27;s 1653 Stationers&#x27; Register entry and Theobald&#x27;s 1727 adaptation. Although the 1613 court payment does connect the play to the King&#x27;s Men, this does not mean Shakespeare wrote it, as the company performed many plays in which he had no hand. The validity of Moseley&#x27;s attribution is not helped by the fact that he is known to have attributed several other now lost plays to Shakespeare. For example, on 29 June 1660, he made an entry in the Register for &quot;the History of King Stephen. Duke Humphrey, a Tragedy. Iphis and Iantha, or a marriage without a man, a Comedy. By Will: Shakespeare.&quot; However, Gary Taylor argues that it is unlikely Moseley was aware of the 1613 court payments to the King&#x27;s Men, which coincides with Shakespeare&#x27;s collaboration with Fletcher on two other plays (&quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;). Taylor believes this adds support to Moseley&#x27;s claim of Shakespearean authorship, especially as Fletcher&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Henry VIII&quot; hadn&#x27;t been established by 1653. Scholars also continue to debate the validity of Theobald&#x27;s claims that he was in possession of a Shakespearean play that had been omitted from all previous editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s work. E. K. Chambers points out several problems with Theobald&#x27;s asserted ownership of the text; no one else ever confirmed seeing the three manuscripts, Theobald&#x27;s claim that he owned them is the only evidence we have; there is no evidence Shakespeare had a &quot;natural daughter&quot; (i.e. an illegitimate daughter), he had two legitimate daughters, and one son, who died age eleven (although John Freehafer argues the reference to &quot;a natural daughter&quot; is to Henrietta Maria du Tremblay, the wife of Shakespeare&#x27;s (alleged) illegitimate son, William Davenant); the manuscripts apparently disappeared after Theobald&#x27;s death and were not listed in his sale catalogue of 23 October 1744; the play is never mentioned in the writings of either Downes or Betterton; and if Theobald was so certain of Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship, why did he not include the play in his 1734 edition of the complete works? Scholars remain divided on the issue of Theobald&#x27;s claims. However, in 2010, &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; was controversially published under the Arden Shakespeare banner, edited by Brian Hammond, who adopts the position set out by G. Harold Metz in his 1989 book, &quot;Sources of Four Plays Ascribed to Shakespeare&quot;; &quot;&quot;Double Falsehood&quot; is mainly Theobald, or Theobald with an earlier adapter, with a substantial admixture of Fletcher and a modicum of Shakespeare.&quot; Hammond, for the most part, accepts Theobald&#x27;s claims, although not without some reservations, and believes that &quot;Double Falsehood&quot; was adapted from &quot;Cardenio&quot;, a play written by Shakespeare and Fletcher.
:Evidence: the dating of the play is based on the fact that Cardenio is a character in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which was not published in English until Thomas Shelton&#x27;s 1612 translation.

=== &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1612–1613) ===
:First official record: a letter by Thomas Lorkin, dated 30 June 1613, in which he describes a fire at the Globe Theatre caused when sparks from an on-stage cannon landed on a thatched roof during a performance of &quot;the play of Hen:8.&quot;
:First published: &quot;First Folio&quot; (1623), as &quot;The Famous History of the Life of King Henry the Eight&quot;.
:First recorded performance: the production mentioned in Lorkin&#x27;s letter took place on 29 June 1613. In a letter by Sir Henry Wotton to Sir Edmund Bacon, dated 2 July 1613, Wotton describes the production as &quot;a new play called &quot;All Is True&quot; representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry the VIIIth.&quot; Traditionally, this was assumed to have been the first performance. However, in another letter describing the fire, written by London merchant Henry Bluett on 4 July 1613, and only discovered in 1981, the play is described as having &quot;been acted not passing 2 or 3 times before,&quot; meaning although 29 June is the first recorded performance, it was not the first actual performance of the play.
:Additional information (attribution): the play is thought to be a collaboration with John Fletcher, a theory first proposed in 1850 by James Spedding (following a suggestion by Alfred, Lord Tennyson), who suggested that Shakespeare&#x27;s original manuscript was touched up by Fletcher and his regular collaborator, Francis Beaumont. Unlike Shakespeare&#x27;s other collaboration(s) with Fletcher (&quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; and, possibly, &quot;Cardenio&quot;), there is no external evidence that Fletcher worked on &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, and any arguments for collaboration are based wholly on stylistic analysis. However, much of this evidence does suggest two writers; a rare word test, Ants Oras&#x27;s pause test, the relationship between prose and verse, vocabulary distribution, and a colloquialism-in-verse test all provide evidence that the play had two different authors. The passages most confidently attributed to Shakespeare are 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2 and 5.1.
:Evidence: the fact that the 29 June performance was such an early performance suggests a date of composition of 1612–1613, a date with which most modern scholars concur. Ever since Spedding, scholars have tended to link the play with the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in February 1613. In his 1957 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, R. A. Foakes argues the overriding theme of the play, especially the final scene, showing the christening of the future Queen Elizabeth, would have perfectly suited the political atmosphere of the period. In early 1613, there was much suspicion of Spain, and Catholic conspiracy, and it was hoped that the marriage would produce an alliance with the devoutly Protestant German princes. In terms of stylistic analysis, the most significant data in terms of dating the play is MacDonald P. Jackson&#x27;s rare word test, which found that the sections of the play thought to be by Shakespeare must be dated to the very end of his career, and if the non-Shakespearean sections were treated as Shakespearean they would be dated to 1599–1600, an obvious impossibility.

=== &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; (1613–1614) ===

:First official record: a fragment from the King&#x27;s Office of the Revels, dated 1619, includes a list of plays which may have been recently performed at court. &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; is one of the plays mentioned.
:First published: published in quarto in 1634 (printed by Thomas Cotes for John Waterson).
:First recorded performance: although the play must have been staged prior to October 1614, records of early productions are vague. The 1619 list may be a list of recently performed plays, but it could also be a list of plays proposed for future performance. The inclusion of two actors&#x27; names in stage directions in the 1634 quarto text (4.2.70.1 and 5.3.0.2) suggest the play was staged in 1625 or 1626 (the actors mentioned are &quot;Curtis&quot; (probably Curtis Greville) and &quot;T. Tucke&quot;, (Thomas Tuckfield), both of whom were with the King&#x27;s Men for the 1625–1626 season only). The quarto text also claims the play had recently been performed at Blackfriars. However, the earliest known performance is in the form of William Davenant&#x27;s adaptation &quot;The Rivals&quot; in 1664. The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean/Fletcher text was in The Old Vic on 28 March 1928, directed by Andrew Leigh.
:Additional information (attribution): attributed to Shakespeare and Fletcher by both the Stationers&#x27; Register entry and the 1634 quarto, there is also much internal evidence that the play was a collaboration between the two. Studies of vocabulary, metre, imagery, pause patterns, the treatment of sources as well as linguistic analysis and rare word tests all suggest the play had two distinct authors. Shakespeare is thought to have written Act 1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and most of Act 5 (except 5.4).
:Evidence: the morris dance in 3.5 borrows from Francis Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray&#x27;s Inn&quot;, which was performed at court on 20 February 1613, probably by the King&#x27;s Men. A &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is fixed by Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot;, first performed on 31 October 1614, which twice sarcastically refers to &quot;Palemon&quot;; Palamon is one of the protagonists in &quot;Noble Kinsmen&quot;. This establishes a date of composition sometime between February 1613 and October 1614. The argument has also been made that the play may have been commissioned specifically for the festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in February 1613. At the time, the country was still in mourning for Prince Henry, who had died in November 1612. Henry was devoutly Protestant, a keen proponent of chivalry and was delighted with Elizabeth&#x27;s choice of husband. Until his death, he was the main planner behind the wedding celebrations and it has been speculated that perhaps Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Inner Temple&quot; was written to cater to Henry&#x27;s penchant for chivalry. Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, upon which &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; is based, is a chivalric romance, and would have been especially fitting for a wedding organised by Henry.

<text>Smithwick&#x27;s () is an Irish red ale-style beer. Smithwick&#x27;s brewery was founded in Kilkenny in 1710 by John Smithwick and run by the Smithwick family of Kilkenny until 1965, when it was acquired by Guinness, now part of Diageo. The Kilkenny brewery was shut down in 2013 and production of all Smithwick&#x27;s and Kilkenny branded beers moved to Dublin; parts of the old brewery were later converted into a &quot;visitor experience&quot;.

==History==
Smithwick&#x27;s Brewery was founded by John Smithwick in 1710. The brewery is on the site of a Franciscan abbey, where monks had brewed ale since the 14th century, and ruins of the original abbey still remain on its grounds. The old brewery was later renovated to become the &quot;Smithwick&#x27;s Experience Kilkenny&quot; visitor attraction and centre. At the time of its closure, it was Ireland&#x27;s oldest operating brewery.

John Smithwick was an orphan who had settled in Kilkenny. Shortly after his arrival, Smithwick went into the brewing business with Richard Cole on a piece of land that Cole had leased from the Duke of Ormond in 1705. Five years later, John Smithwick became the owner of the land. The brewery stayed small, servicing a loyal local following while John Smithwick diversified.

Following John Smithwick&#x27;s death, the brewery temporarily fell out of family hands. John Smithwick&#x27;s great-grandson Edmond bought the brewery land back freehold and worked to reshape its future. Edmond concentrated on discovering new markets and successfully building export trade. Drinkers in England, Scotland and Wales developed a taste for Smithwick&#x27;s brews and output increased fivefold.

As a result of substantial contributions made to St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Edmond became great friends with Irish liberal Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who later became godfather to one of his sons. Edmond Smithwick became well known and respected by the people of Kilkenny, who elected him town mayor four times.

In 1800, export sales began to fall and the brewing industry encountered difficulty. To combat this, the Smithwick family increased production in their maltings, began selling mineral water and delivered butter with the ale from the back of their drays. 

By 1900, output was at an all-time low and the then owner James Smithwick was advised by auditors to shut the doors of the brewery. Instead, James reduced the range of beers they produced and set out to find new markets. He secured military contracts and soon after saw output increase again. James&#x27; son, Walter, took control in 1930 and steered the brewery to success through the hardships of both World War II and increasingly challenging weather conditions. By January 1950, Smithwick&#x27;s was exporting ale to Boston.

Smithwick&#x27;s was purchased from Walter Smithwick in 1965 by Guinness and is now, along with Guinness, part of Diageo. Together, Guinness &amp; Co. and Smithwick&#x27;s developed and launched Smithwick&#x27;s Draught Ale in 1966. By 1979, half a million barrels were sold each year. In 1980, Smithwick&#x27;s began exporting to France. In 1993, Smithwick&#x27;s Draught became Canada&#x27;s leading imported ale. By 2010, Smithwick&#x27;s continued to be brewed in Dundalk and Kilkenny, with tankers sent to Dublin to be kegged for the on-trade market. Cans and bottles were packaged by IBC in Belfast. Production in the Kilkenny brewery finished on 31 December 2013 and Smithwick&#x27;s brands are now produced in the Diageo St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery in Dublin.

In 2016 Walter Smithwick&#x27;s son Paul launched Sullivan&#x27;s Ale with his son Daniel, which has its home in Kilkenny. The original Kilkenny site was sold to Kilkenny County Council, with a small portion of the site dedicated to the opening of a visitor&#x27;s centre, the &quot;Smithwick&#x27;s Experience Kilkenny&quot;.

==Smithwick Family==
Walter and Eileen Smithwick had six children: Judge Peter Smithwick, Michael, Anne, Judy, Paul and John. 

Judge Peter Smithwick (born 1937) is an Irish judge, and chairman and sole member of the Smithwick Tribunal, a Tribunal of Inquiry into the events surrounding the killing of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).

Paul Smithwick (born 1943) launched Sullivan&#x27;s Ale in 2016 with his son Daniel. His eldest daughter, Emma Smithwick, is a well-known TV producer in London. His daughter Georgina is a technology entrepreneur, named by Sunday Times as one of the Top 100 Innovators in Great Britain.

The Smithwick Family, also owned a Wholesale Cash and Carry business trading as Kilkenny Wholesale Cash and Carry based at New Street, Kilkenny City. A spin off from their core brewing business. And a member of the National Wholesale Grocers Alliance and later Stonehouse Marketing buying groups. This business was sold in 2006 to Barry Group in Mallow, owners of Costcutter and Carryout Franchises in the Republic of Ireland, with the cash and carry being closed and the distribution business transferred to a central distribution centre in Mallow, Co. Cork.

==Sullivan&#x27;s Brewery==
In the &quot;Old Kilkenny Review&quot;, 1964, Peter Smithwick, K.M., Solicitor, wrote that the tradition in Kilkenny is that Sullivan&#x27;s Brewery was founded in 1702 by Daniel Sullivan, a Protestant, who bought property in trust for Pierse Bryan of Jenkinstown, a Catholic who was prohibited by the Penal Laws from buying land. The property, on the West side of High Street, &quot;standing backwards in James&#x27;s Street&quot;, is believed to have been the site of Sullivan&#x27;s Brewery, the forerunner of Smithwicks.

==Brands==
* Smithwick&#x27;s Draught is an Irish red ale and, as the style suggests, has a red tone. It is produced using hops and roasted, malted barley. In 2004, Diageo PLC began distribution in the USA. Smithwick&#x27;s had previously been marketed in Canada.

* Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale is similar to Smithwick&#x27;s Draught; however, it has a creamy head similar to Guinness, and it has a stronger and more bitter taste than Smithwick&#x27;s. The Kilkenny name was originally used during the 1980s and 1990s to market a stronger version of Smithwick&#x27;s for the European and Canadian market due to local difficulty in pronunciation of the word &quot;Smithwick&#x27;s&quot;, but it now refers to a similar yet distinctly different beer.

* Smithwick&#x27;s Pale Ale was launched in 2011. The ale is made of pale ale malt, traditional Smithwick&#x27;s yeast and Amarillo hops and has an ABV of 4.5%.

<text>Carl Wilhelm Eugen Stenhammar (February 7, 1871 – November 20, 1927) was a Swedish composer, conductor and pianist.

==Biography==
Stenhammar was born in Stockholm to and . His brother was the architect Ernst Stenhammar. He received his first musical education in Stockholm. He then went to Berlin to further his studies in music. He became a glowing admirer of German music, especially Richard Wagner and Anton Bruckner. Stenhammar himself described the style of his First Symphony in F major as &quot;idyllic Bruckner&quot;. He subsequently sought to emancipate himself and write in a more &quot;Nordic&quot; style, looking to Carl Nielsen and Jean Sibelius for guidance. The latter&#x27;s Symphony No. 2, especially, had a great effect on him, leading him to change his style and withdraw his own First Symphony from performance. Having seen Sibelius&#x27;s symphony performed in Stockholm, Stenhammar wrote to him:You should know that you are in my thoughts daily ever since I heard the symphony. You magnificent person, it is of course a huge armful of wonder that you brought up out of the unconscious and ineffable depth. That which I felt has been verified: You are in this moment for me as the foremost, the only, the enigmatic one... I have also just written a symphony. At least it is called a symphony, and only in accordance with the understanding that you perhaps have forgotten should it be dedicated to you. However, nothing came of it. It is quite good, but somewhat superficial. I yearn to reach my inner self. And you can wait until I have arrived there. The great day when this happens, I will print your name in large letters on the title page. It may become a symphony or something else.The result of his search for a new style was the Second Symphony in G minor, composed nearly twelve years after the First Symphony, which shows the influence of Nielsen, Sibelius and Franz Berwald among others.

In autumn of 1892, Stenhammar moved to Berlin for seven months to study with Heinrich Barth, where he devoted his time to rigorous piano practice and composition. Barth was satisfied with Stenhammar&#x27;s performances and gave him increasingly technically challenging pieces to practice, such as the &quot;Variations on a Theme of Paganini&quot; by Johannes Brahms, a composer he admired.

From 1906 to 1922 Stenhammar was Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony, the first full-time professional orchestra in Sweden. In this capacity, he organised many performances of music by contemporary Scandinavian composers. In 1909, he briefly held the position of director of music at Uppsala University, where he was succeeded the following year by Hugo Alfvén. After moving back to Stockholm in the early 1920s, he returned to touring despite his declining health.

Wilhelm Stenhammar died of a stroke at 56 years of age in Jonsered in the historic province of Västergötland. He is buried in Gothenburg. He had two children with his wife , and , both of whom were singers.

==Work==
His works were quite varied and included two completed symphonies, a substantial &quot;Serenade for Orchestra&quot;, two piano concertos, four piano sonatas, a violin sonata, seven string quartets (one of which was withdrawn), many songs and other vocal works, including several large-scale works for chorus or voices and orchestra: the early ballad &quot;Florez och Blanzeflor&quot;, Op. 3, written around 1891, &quot;Ithaka&quot;, Op. 21, from 1904, the cantatas &quot;Ett folk&quot; (&quot;A people&quot;) from 1905 and &quot;Sången&quot; (&quot;The song&quot;), Op. 44, from 1921.

Writing in &quot;The Chamber Music Journal&quot;, R.H.R. Silvertrust opines that Stenhammar&#x27;s six string quartets are the most important written between those of Johannes Brahms and Béla Bartók. Whether or not this is so, there is no denying that Stenhammar&#x27;s quartets represent a very important development during the twenty-five years he was writing chamber music. Tonally, they range from the middle late Romantics to a style akin to mature Sibelius. Though not unknown by the Swedish chamber music public, his string quartets have been neglected elsewhere. In 2008 Musikaliska konstföreningen published the world premiere edition of his &quot;Allegro Brillante&quot; for piano quartet composed in 1891 and his &quot;Allegro non tanto&quot; for piano trio composed in 1895.

Stenhammar was considered the finest Swedish pianist of his time. Pianists who venture into the realm of the string quartet often wind up writing compositions that sound as though they were composed at, and are perhaps better played on, the piano. That Stenhammar&#x27;s works show no such trait is because, for nearly half of his life, he worked intimately with the Aulin Quartet, the top Swedish string quartet of his day and one of the best then performing in Europe. In fact, he toured throughout Europe with them for many years and a piano quintet was nearly always featured on their programmes. Thus it is no accident that his quartets show a fine grasp of instrumental timbre and technique. The part writing is sure, always idiomatic and evenly distributed.

Stenhammar recorded five piano rolls for Welte-Mignon on 21 September 1905.

<text>Which? is a United Kingdom brand name that promotes informed consumer choice in the purchase of goods and services by testing products, highlighting inferior products or services, raising awareness of consumer rights, and offering independent advice. The brand name is used by the Consumers&#x27; Association, a registered charity and company limited by guarantee that owns several businesses, including Which? Financial Services Limited (Which? Mortgage Advisers), Which? Legal Limited and Which? Limited, which publishes the &quot;Which?&quot; Papers.

The vast majority of the association&#x27;s income comes from the profit it makes on its trading businesses, for instance subscriptions to &quot;Which?&quot; magazine, which are donated to the campaigning part of the organisation to fund advocacy activity and inform the public about consumer issues. &quot;Which?&quot; magazine maintains its independence by not accepting advertising, and the organisation receives no government funding. The Consumers&#x27; Association is the largest consumer organisation in the UK, with over 573,000 subscribers to its magazine.

Until 2006, the association used prize draws similar to those of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; to attract subscribers, but following criticism they were discontinued. The Association attracts subscribers to its publications with free mini-guides and trial offers.

==History and background==
The organisation was set up in 1957 as a response to the changing values and concerns of the post-war era, at a time of rapid changes in product markets and consumer behaviour – and a corresponding growth in sharp trading practices. To combat this, Michael Young, research director for the Labour Party, proposed setting up a &#x27;Consumer Advisory Service&#x27; to be considered for the party&#x27;s 1950 manifesto, only to be rejected by Harold Wilson.

Encouraged by the efforts of Dorothy Bruchholz Goodman, of the United States, and her British husband Raymond J. Goodman, Young continued to push the idea and in October 1957 the first &quot;Which?&quot; magazine was published from a converted garage in Bethnal Green. Its central aim was to improve the standard of goods and services available to the public in the UK. Under the editorship of Eirlys Roberts, the publication started as a small 32-page magazine that included reports on electric kettles, sunglasses, aspirin, cake-mixes, scouring powders, no-iron cottons and British cars.

By 1959, membership reached 150,000 and a membership services office in Hertford. In 1960, &quot;Which?&quot; helped to found the International Organisation of Consumer Unions, later Consumers International. In 1962, coverage expanded with the launch of the first quarterly &quot;Which? car&quot; supplement, which becomes &quot;Motoring Which?&quot; in 1965, followed by &quot;Money Which?&quot; in 1968.

In 1970, &quot;Which?&quot; bought a set of buildings in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, to set up labs to test products including domestic appliances, DIY equipment, and consumer electronics. Previously, the work had been contracted out. The 1970s saw &quot;Which?&quot; taking a greater campaigning role, and it began to adopt a more aggressive stance on issues such as lead poisoning and aircraft noise. In 1971, for example, &quot;Which?&quot; published the first league table on the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. In 1973, Maurice Healy succeeded Eirlys Roberts as editor, and became editor-in-chief for all the &quot;Which?&quot; magazines, before he left in 1977 to join the National Consumer Council.

The organisation also dabbled in high street consumer advice centres during the 1970s. More than 120 such centres were operating in 1977–78, many of them funded by local councils. The centres closed as funding was withdrawn by the government in 1980.

&quot;Which?&quot; continued campaigning on consumer safety issues, with its car safety test results strengthening calls to legislate car manufacturers to fit seat belts in all new cars, helping to make it compulsory to Clunk Click Every Trip in 1983. In 1992, &quot;Which?&quot; launched another satellite publication, this one aimed at youngsters aged 11–15, called &quot;Check It Out!&quot;, but it failed to take off and closed in June 1994. In 1995, testing facilities were moved to Milton Keynes where they remained until 2002, when the majority of the &quot;Which?&quot; testing activities were contracted out. &quot;Which?&quot; Online, the first incarnation of the &quot;Which?&quot; website, was launched in 1996 which incorporated its own ISP, email and content in addition to the Which Online Forum - an area accessible to members which offered unfettered access to members of the senior management within Which? including the Directors.

The trading organisation was rebranded as &quot;Which?&quot; in 2004 and this is the brand promoted to the general public. However the charity the Consumers&#x27; Association continues to own &quot;Which? Limited&quot; and retains its own name.

Following the deregulation of the gas and electricity industry, &quot;Which?&quot; launched a free online energy comparison service called &quot;Switch with Which?&quot; in 2005, to compare energy tariffs. The service was awarded Energywatch Confidence Code accreditation in 2006.

==Legal powers==
===Super-complaints===
The Consumers&#x27; Association has the power under The Enterprise Act 2002 to take action on behalf of consumers, including the ability to bring a super-complaint to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). &quot;Which?&quot; is one of five organisations able to issue a super-complaint. The Consumers&#x27; Association was among the first groups granted these new powers, and was among the first to have them regranted when the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) was replaced by the FCA. A super-complaint can be made about any market that is not working properly for consumers. As consumers are not in the position to overcome the issue themselves, &quot;Which?&quot; can issue a super-complaint on consumers&#x27; behalf. The FCA has 90 days in which to assess the complaint and decide what to do about it. It can reject the complaint in part or as a whole, it can launch a market investigation, take action under competition law or consumer law, or refer the market to the Competition and Markets Authority for further investigation.

&quot;Which?&quot; made its first super-complaint about private dentistry in 2001. It later made complaints about care homes, the Northern Ireland banking sector and credit card interest calculation methods. In March 2011, it made a super-complaint about unfair debit and credit card payment surcharges made by retailers. The OFT upheld the super-complaint in June 2011.

In September 2016, &quot;Which?&quot; filed a super-complaint against banks that routinely refused to reimburse victims who had been scammed into transferring money into fraudsters&#x27; accounts.
&quot;Which?&quot; said banks should &quot;shoulder more responsibility&quot; for such fraud, much as they already reimburse customers who lose money through scams involving fraudulent account activity, or debit or credit cards. According to official industry data, such scams increased by 53% in a year: from 660,308 cases in the first half of 2015 to 1,007,094 in the first half of 2016. &quot;Which?&quot; said: &quot;Consumers can only protect themselves so far. People cannot be expected to detect complex scams pressuring them to transfer money immediately, or lookalike bills from their solicitor or builder&quot; that are copied from genuine bills but have had the bank account number and sort code changed.

===Legal action against rogue traders===
In 2005, &quot;Which?&quot; was granted legal powers to bring rogue traders to account for their actions under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002.

===Unfair contract terms===
&quot;Which?&quot; has statutory powers under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, where they can seek an injunction to restrain the use of an unfair contract term by a trader against consumers.

===Competition Appeals Tribunal===
&quot;Which?&quot; is one of the &#x27;specified bodies&#x27; who, under the Enterprise and Competition Acts, may bring proceedings before the Competition Appeals Tribunal (CAT) on behalf of two or more consumers for damages. &quot;Which?&quot; was granted specified body status on 1 October 2005 by the Ministers of the Department of Trade and Industry. In April 2007, &quot;Which?&quot; launched its first representative action on behalf of consumers unlawfully overcharged for football shirts due to price fixing.

==Organisational structure==
The Consumers&#x27; Association owns an operational company Which? Ltd who report to the Council of Trustees. The Board of Which? Ltd is made up primarily of co-opted members, members of &quot;Which?&quot; staff and some representatives from the Consumers&#x27; Association Council.

The Consumers&#x27; Association is subject to both the Companies Act 2006 and to charity requirements. Since 2012, it is governed by a Council of nine elected and up-to six co-opted members who can serve a maximum of nine years at any one time.

Only Ordinary members of the Consumers&#x27; Association can stand for the council. Any subscriber can become a member of the Consumers&#x27; Association by agreeing to guarantee the debts of the Association to a maximum of 50p. It also means they will receive Annual Accounts, AGM Minutes, and be able to vote on Resolutions that change the governing Articles.
