<text>Hamilton Academical Football Club, often known as Hamilton Accies, or The Accies, is a Scottish football club from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, who currently compete in the . They were established in 1874 from the school football team at Hamilton Academy and remain the only professional club in British football to have originated from a school team. Hamilton have won the Scottish Challenge Cup three times and have finished runners-up in the Scottish Cup twice. The club play their home games at New Douglas Park.

==Club history==
Hamilton Academical F.C. was formed in late 1874 by the rector and pupils of Hamilton Academy. The club soon became members of the Scottish Football Association and initially began competing in the Scottish Cup and Qualifying Cup, before joining the Scottish Football League in November 1897 following the resignation of Renton.

Throughout its history, the club has only reached two Scottish Cup finals. The first, in 1911, resulted in a goalless draw against Celtic at Ibrox Park. The replay, again held at Ibrox, attracted a crowd of 45,000 spectators and ended in a 2–0 defeat for Hamilton Academical. Their next chance at major silverware was the 1935 Scottish Cup final. Despite a Bertie Harrison goal (the club&#x27;s only in a final of a major competition), Rangers went on to win the match in front of over 87,000 spectators by two Jimmy Smith goals. 

In the 1970s, Hamilton briefly resigned from the league due to mounting debts. In 1994 the club sold its home ground, Douglas Park, to Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, and subsequently ground-shared in Coatbridge and Glasgow for seven years. During this period the club went through financial hardships and unpaid players went on strike. As a result, Hamilton was unable to fulfil one fixture during the 1999–2000 season and were docked 15 points, the result of which was relegation to the Third Division. The club moved into its New Douglas Park stadium in 2001.

In 2008, for the first time in 20 years, Accies gained promotion to the top division of Scottish football, the Scottish Premier League. In the 2009–10 season, a 3–0 victory against Kilmarnock on 17 April 2010 secured a third straight season in Scotland&#x27;s top flight with four games remaining.

The Accies&#x27; stay in the SPL ended in the 2010–11 season, when they were relegated after a 1–0 defeat away to St Johnstone. Despite their relegation, Hamilton&#x27;s time in the top flight was most notable for their emphasis on youth, including midfielders James McCarthy and James McArthur, both of whom went on to play for English club Wigan Athletic in the Premier League before gaining international recognition.

===Return to the Premiership===

After a hard-fought campaign during the 2013–14 Scottish Championship season, Accies finished in second position on the final day of the season following a 10–2 home victory over Morton. Despite the disappointment of missing out on automatic promotion to Dundee, they went on to defeat Falkirk 2–1 on aggregate in the first stage of their Premiership play-off to face top-flight Hibernian over two legs for a place in the 2014–15 Scottish Premiership. Hamilton lost the first leg 2–0 at New Douglas Park, but two away goals in the return leg at Easter Road, including an injury time strike, forced the tie to extra time and penalty-kicks. Hamilton converted all of their spot-kicks and gained promotion back to the top flight. Manager Alex Neil left the club in January 2015, to take up a position at English club Norwich.

Hamilton found themselves in another playoff at the end of 2016–17, this time as the Premiership incumbents. A close tie against Championship representatives Dundee United ended in a 1–0 aggregate victory, with Accies youth graduate Greg Docherty scoring the only goal.

===2017 fraud incident===
In October 2017, an elaborate voice phishing fraud was perpetrated on Hamilton Academical. Posing as a fraud investigator for the club&#x27;s bank (Royal Bank of Scotland), the culprit convinced the club&#x27;s account handler that funds were at risk from corruption within the company and should be moved temporarily, providing instructions to evade suspicion in the bank&#x27;s genuine checks when monies began to be transferred. The account handler also spoke to an accomplice via a telephone number provided by the main culprit to &#x27;confirm&#x27; the legitimacy of the instructions. With the employee sufficiently deceived, a total of close to £1 million was transferred out of the club&#x27;s accounts over several transactions, with the fraud being discovered the following day. The incident involved most of the club&#x27;s working funds, causing the abandonment of a project to improve the youth academy.

In February 2018, having only been able to recover a small percentage of their funds, Hamilton publicly declared that they were preparing to take legal action against the bank for a portion of the loss, believing the bank&#x27;s security measures to have been inadequate in detecting the fraud (due to the unusual pattern of the transactions and the large sums involved); RBS rebutted this but stated they were working with the club and the police to identify those responsible. The &quot;Accies&quot; chief executive Colin McGowan later described RBS as &quot;morally bankrupt&quot; after he was informed during discussions to prevent future losses that the bank&#x27;s system did not allow customers to set daily transfer limits.

===Decline===
After spending seven years in the Scottish Premiership, Hamilton were eventually relegated, finishing 12th in the Scottish Premiership in the 2020–21 season, meaning the club returned to the Scottish Championship.

Following their return to the Scottish Championship, Hamilton continued to struggle on the pitch and once again found themselves battling relegation. However, they managed to avoid back-to-back relegations with two games to spare after a 1–0 win away to Greenock Morton ensured safety. Accies eventually finished 6th on their return to the Scottish Championship. 

The 2022–23 season was once again a difficult one for Hamilton, as they again found themselves in a relegation battle. They managed to avoid automatic relegation, entering the relegation play-offs. Despite winning the 2023 Scottish Challenge Cup final, the winning goal scored in the thirtieth minute by Reghan Tumilty, the club eventually lost in the Championship play-off final on penalties to Airdrieonians which confirmed the club&#x27;s relegation to Scottish League One. This meant that Hamilton had been relegated twice in the space of three seasons, falling from the Scottish Premiership in 2021 to League One by 2023. Hamilton were promoted back to the Scottish Championship after defeating Inverness Caledonian Thistle 5–3 on aggregate in the play-off final.

==Stadium==
The club play their fixtures at New Douglas Park, which was opened in 2001. The pitch is an artificial surface. The stadium has an overall capacity of 6,018 and is composed of two permanent and one temporary stand.

The ground replaced Douglas Park, which was the home of Hamilton from 1888 to 1994. The ground was opened on 30 May 1888 with a match against Glasgow University. It was eventually sold to supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s in 1994, with the proceeds going towards the construction of the new stadium, which lies adjacent to the site of Douglas Park.

Between 1994 and 2001 the club had no home. They ground-shared at Cliftonhill and Firhill Stadium.

Since 2021 the club have been sharing New Douglas Park with Clyde.

<text>Zwickauer Land is a former Kreis (district) in the south-west of Saxony, Germany. Neighboring districts were (from north-east clockwise) Chemnitzer Land, Stollberg, Aue-Schwarzenberg, Vogtlandkreis, and the districts Greiz and Altenburger Land in Thuringia. The district-free city of Zwickau was located in the center of the district and nearly completely surrounded by it.

== History ==
In early days Zwickau was the starting point for the settlement of a whole region. The first official document of the ”territorim zwickaw” dates from May 1, 1118. The settlement by German farmers took mainly place in the second half of the 12th century. At the same time castles were built. A special area was administered by a bailiff, as a representative of the governor. The Wettiners were the most powerful rulers in Saxony in the 13th century. In the region of Zwickau the sovereign of Schönburg and Wildenfels were given the rule over their comparatively small territories.

With the division of the Saxon country the administrative structures became unclear in Leipzig in 1485. The borderline between albertinian and ernestinian possession was tangent to the Zwickauer city boundary. With the development of the Saxon state uniformed administrative structures began gradually to develop. In the Middle Ages the Saxon area was divided into governor&#x27;s residence, apart from the central administration. Out of this new jobs developed in the 15th century. The “administrators” (Amtsmann) practised the jurisdiction, and were responsible for the military quantity and public security.

The administrators came from the rural aristocracy. The noble administrator was promoted to the “chief administrator” (Amtshauptmann) during the following century, who usually supervised two to four offices. At the same time the “Kursaxon” territory was divided into districts for a better administration. The district was headed by a “county administrator” (Kreishauptmann or Oberhauptmann).

During the whole Middle Ages and afterwards – even until our century - the city Zwickau with their surrounding area was regarded as a unit, concerning administrative matters.

Ongoing conflicts, for example the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Seven Years&#x27; War, influenced the administration negatively.

Zwickau was the seat of the chief administrator. Since 1828, additionally the county administrators ruled from there the Southwest and the middle “Erzgebirge” and the suburbs.

Only in 1835, became the regional administration a new structure. The county administrators were replaced by “district directions” (Kreisdirektion) in Dresden, Leipzig, Bautzen and Zwickau. The chief administrators in Zwickau, Chemnitz, Wolkenstein, Plauen and in the territory of the sovereign of Schönburg belonged to the district direction Zwickau.

The following offices were headed by the chief administrator in Zwickau: Kirchberg, Werdau, Schwarzenberg, Eibenstock and of course Zwickau. Hartenstein, Lichtenstein, Stein, Waldenburg and Glauchau were controlled by the sovereign of Schönburg.

In 1856 an important step toward modern administration was done with the establishment of new administration offices, the “offices of court” (Gerichtsamt). Thereby the old office organization could be overcome.

In 1873 justice and administration were separated. Now the offices of court were only responsible for the law. The “administration crews” (Amtshauptmannschaft) were responsible for the administration. There were four “county administration crews” (Kreishauptmannschaften), which were created as organs of the Saxon government. The county administration crew of Zwickau consisted of the administration crews in Annaberg, Auerbach, Chemnitz, Flöha, Marienberg, Oelsnitz, Plauen, Schwarzenberg and Zwickau.

In 1919 a branch office of Zwickau was opened in Werdau. It became an independent office in 1920, but in 1933 it was affiliated to Zwickau again.

The rural constitution of 1946 as well as the Saxon constitution of 1947 established democratic values in Saxony again, like they had existed before the beginning of the Third Reich.

Now part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the federal state of Saxony was liquidated as part of the administration reforms implemented from July 23, 1952. At the same time the former district Zwickau was divided into the districts Werdau and Zwickau. The area of the district Zwickau received a strong reduction. A considerable part turned into the district Werdau; furthermore, parts of the Zwickauer area were added to the district of Reichenbach. On the other hand the &quot;Mülsengrund&quot; was extracted from the district Glauchau and was affiliated to the district Zwickau.

With the dramatic events in autumn 1989, the Berlin Wall came down. The German Democratic Republic ceased to exist as Germany was re-united. With Saxon parliamentary elections on October 14, 1990, the federal state of Saxony was re-established. On May 6, 1990 local elections took place. At the constituent meeting of district assembly Christian Otto was elected head of the administration of the district Zwickau. In the district Werdau the citizens elected Georg Hamburg to head of the administration.

With the district reform on August 1, 1994, the rural district “Zwickauer Land” was created, seated in Werdau. With the termination of the municipality regional reorganization on January 1, 1999, the district changed its geographical face again. The places Cainsdorf, Mosel, Oberrothenbach and Schlunzig were affiliated to Zwickau against the will of the people living there.

In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Zwickauer Land, Chemnitzer Land and the urban district Zwickau were merged into the new district Zwickau.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the Ore Mountains, with the main river s being the &quot;Zwickauer Mulde&quot; and the &quot;Pleiße&quot;.

<text>Fuzzy-Felt is a simple fabric toy intended for young children, first sold in 1950. The toys consist of a flocked backing board onto which a number of felt shapes are placed to create different pictures. Felt pieces can be simple silhouettes or more detailed printed shapes. For a farmyard scene, for example, auxiliary pieces would typically be cows, sheep, chickens, horses, cats, dogs, a farmer, and a tractor. Other scenes might include hospitals, pets, and vehicles. Fuzzy-Felt is for children over the age of three years, as the pieces may present a choking hazard.

==History==
Fuzzy-Felt was invented by Lois Allan (d. Farnham Common 1989) during World War II, although similar products had existed pre-war, for example, Kiddicraft K100 &#x27;Pictures in Felt&#x27; of 1937. Born Lois Day, she was an American. She studied art and fashion in Paris in the 1920s. She married a Scotsman and Great War RAF Captain, Peter Allan, and moved to Vine Cottage in Farnham Common in Buckinghamshire in the United Kingdom, where the couple ran a travel agency and other entrepreneurial pursuits including printing cruise ships on cigarette cases. 

During the Second World War, Peter’s son, Lois’s step-son, Anthony Murray Allan, also known as Jock or Peter, was captured by the Germans, escaping from a prison camp as part of the Laufen 6, but was recaptured and sent to Colditz, where he daringly escaped inside a mattress, only to be recaptured in Austria.

During the Second World War, Peter and Lois Allan contributed to the war effort by manufacturing felt gaskets for sealing components in tanks in the outbuildings of her home. Other women were involved in this work, and the Allans ran a creche for their children. She was inspired to create the toy after observing how much enjoyment children had taking the discarded and misshaped pieces of felt and sticking them to the backs of table mats. Product development following the end of the War took a few years, but after gaining the interest of toy buyers at John Lewis and Heals, Allan was able to bring Fuzzy-Felt to market in 1950, later founding Allan Industries Ltd.

Production continued at Allan&#x27;s home, Vine Cottage, until 1972 when the business relocated to larger premises in the Cressex Estate in High Wycombe. In 1996 the business was bought by Mandolyn Ltd in a management buy-out, and production continued in High Wycombe until increasing manufacturing costs led to the licensing of the Fuzzy-Felt brand to a much larger UK toy manufacturer and wholesalers, Toy Brokers Ltd of Huntingdon. In 2001, via his holding company, Mr Douglas Ware a Buckinghamshire-based businessman acquired a controlling interest in Mandolyn Ltd. This holding company became 100% owner of Mandolyn Ltd and Fuzzy-Felt Ltd in 2012. In 2011, Toy Brokers Ltd had in turn been bought by John Adams Leisure Ltd who then became the licensee of the Fuzzy-Felt brand for Toy products.

As of 2016, an estimated 26.25 million sets of Fuzzy-felt had been sold internationally. Although Fuzzy-Felt reached its peak in popularity sometime in the mid-1970s, it remains an iconic children&#x27;s toy, still enjoyed by children who play with it and parents who nostalgically purchase it.

==Popularity==

Many reasons have been attributed to Fuzzy-Felt’s popularity. Though seemingly simple, the various available themed sets allow for hours of creativity. Though the sets started out strictly as a collection of various coloured shapes, countless themes Fuzzy-Felt sets became available through the years. “Ballet, Farmyard, Circus, Hospital, and much later on Thomas the Tank Engine, Noddy, and My Little Pony were released to inspire [a child’s] picture-making” abilities.

Fuzzy-Felt was also a favoured toy in Sunday schools because of its “Bible Stories set, complete with camels and three kings.”

The quiet toy was, and still is, fairly cheap, and can be played almost anywhere leaving little mess, save a few stray pieces of shaped felt behind, making it a popular choice among parents.

==In popular culture==
===Fashion===
In 2008, fashion designer Stella McCartney used a “ 7-meter high, 14-meter wide” Fuzzy-Felt backdrop, created by artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, as a visual accent for the debut of her 2008 spring/summer collection in Paris. The backdrop was made up of “rainbow-coloured rabbits, giraffes and a particularly anxious ladybird”, all reminiscent of the 1970s child’s toy.

===Literature===
In Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s novel &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot;, the protagonist Jess uses Fuzzy-Felt to depict Bible scenes, one of which is a rewrite of Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. She depicts Daniel as getting eaten by the lions, and when confronted by the pastor tries to disguise this by saying that she &#x27;wanted to do Jonah and the whale, but they don&#x27;t do whales in Fuzzy-Felt&#x27;. The pastor then tells Jess that they should do the Astonishment at Dawn scene, and Jess remarks to herself that this is &#x27;hopeless... Susan Green was sick on the tableau of the three Wise Men at Christmas, and you only get three kings to a box&#x27;.

===Music===
Fuzzy-Felt Folk is a collection of “rare, delightful folk oddities for strange adults and maybe their children too… The front cover imagery of the album is from the original 1968 Fuzzy-Felt Fantasy set.”

===Current===
Fuzzy-Felt toy products are currently sold by John Adams Leisure Ltd of Huntingdon, under license from Fuzzy-Felt Ltd and Mandolyn Ltd. There is a UK registered trade mark (number 2461883) for &quot;Fuzzy-Felt&quot;, registered to a non-trading UK company (number 03227732) &quot;Fuzzy-Felt Ltd&quot;. In 2017 Fuzzy-Felt was commemorated with a special stamp from the Royal Mail, which was celebrating 10 of the most iconic and much-loved British toys from the last 100 years. Fuzzy-Felt was amongst the top ten classic toys chosen. Even after nearly 70 years, Fuzzy-Felt continues to evoke feelings of nostalgia across generations and is still hugely popular throughout the world today.

<doc id="309513" wikidata="Q314773" url="?curid=309513" title="Lord Randolph Churchill">
<text>Lord Randolph Henry Spencer-Churchill (13 February 1849 – 24 January 1895) was a British aristocrat and politician. Churchill was a Tory radical and coined the term &quot;Tory democracy&quot;. He participated in the creation of the National Union of the Conservative Party. 
He became Secretary of State for India, and later was Chancellor of the Exchequer. As Chancellor, he attracted both admiration and criticism across the political spectrum. Some critics were from his own party, including some of his friends. In 1886 he risked a tactical resignation as Chancellor to try to secure his position on armed forces expenditure, but the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, accepted his resignation and replaced him, effectively ending Churchill&#x27;s career. 

His elder son was Winston Churchill, whose biography of him was published in 1906.

==Early life==

Born at 3 Wilton Terrace, Belgravia, London, Randolph was the third son of John Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford and his wife the Marchioness of Blandford (&quot;née&quot; Lady Frances Vane). His parents became the (seventh) Duke and Duchess of Marlborough upon the death of John&#x27;s father in 1857. As the younger son of a marquess, Randolph had the courtesy title &quot;lord&quot;; as a commoner, he could sit in the House of Commons.

Churchill attended Tabor&#x27;s Preparatory School, Cheam, then from 1863 Eton College, where he remained until 1865. He did not stand out either at academic work or sport while at Eton; his contemporaries described him as a vivacious and rather unruly boy. Among the lifelong friendships he made at school were with Arthur Balfour and Archibald Primrose (later Lord Rosebery).

In October 1867, Churchill matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. At Oxford, Primrose – now with his own courtesy title of &quot;Lord Dalmeny&quot; – was along with Churchill a member of the Bullingdon Club, and joined him at the club&#x27;s champagne-fuelled parties. Randolph was frequently in trouble with the university authorities for drunkenness, smoking in academic dress, and smashing windows at the Randolph Hotel. His rowdy behaviour was infectious, rubbing off on friends and contemporaries; he gained a reputation as an &quot;enfant terrible&quot;. He had a liking for hunting, but was also a well-read historian. He took a second in jurisprudence and modern history in 1870.

Churchill experienced no early doubts but made mistakes, as alluded to in Rosebery&#x27;s biography. He never regretted being an early friend and admirer of the Disraelis. His behaviour was, however, the later cause of dissension in his relations with a colder, more aloof, disciplinarian Salisbury. In 1871 Churchill and his elder brother George were initiated into the rites of Freemasonry, as later his son Winston would be.

At the general election of 1874 Churchill was elected to Parliament as Conservative member for Woodstock, near the family seat of Blenheim Palace, defeating George Brodrick, a Fellow of Merton. His maiden speech, delivered in his first session, prompted compliments from William Harcourt and Benjamin Disraeli, who wrote to the Queen of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;energy and natural flow&quot;.

Churchill was a friend of Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, and received &quot;extensive loans&quot; from the Rothschilds. He reported on the mining industry in South Africa on their behalf, where their agent Cecil Rhodes was consolidating mining deposits which ultimately led to the creation of De Beers.

==Marriage and medical condition==
Lord Randolph Churchill was married at the British Embassy in Paris on 15 April 1874 to Jennie Jerome, daughter of Leonard Jerome, an American businessman. The couple had two sons:
*Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill (30 November 187424 January 1965)
*John Strange &quot;Jack&quot; Spencer-Churchill (4 February 188023 February 1947)

In January 1875, about a month after Winston&#x27;s birth, Randolph made repeated visits to Dr Oscar Clayton. He had twenty years to live, but suffered from debilitating illness, particularly in his last decade. Quinault, writing in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, theorises that Randolph was probably passing through the stages of secondary syphilis and then tertiary syphilis, but mentions a brain tumour and multiple sclerosis as other possible causes. Whatever the true source of this illness was, Randolph was certainly treated for syphilis, and it has been suggested that he may have been suffering from symptoms related to the mercury-based medication which was used in such cases at the time. Clayton was a society doctor and specialist in the treatment of syphilis who worked from his practice at 5 Harley Street. Robson Roose, who was the Churchills&#x27; family doctor in the 1880s, had written on syphilis as a root cause of debilitating disease, and subsequently diagnosed Randolph as suffering from it. He referred Randolph to the specialist Thomas Buzzard, but continued to prescribe potassium iodide and mercury.

According to Frank Harris, who published the allegation in autobiography, &quot;My Life and Loves&quot; (1922–27), &quot;Randolph had caught syphilis&quot;. He relied on a story by Louis Jennings, an associate of Randolph&#x27;s who had later fallen out with him. John H. Mather of the National Churchill Library and Center called into question Harris&#x27;s veracity, and offered the alternative theory of a &quot;left side brain tumour&quot;. Mather noted that &quot;[t]here is no indication that Lady Randolph or her sons were infected with syphilis.&quot; Additionally, author Richard M. Langworth claims that Roose never actually identified the disease that Randolph was suffering from as syphilis, instead using the term &quot;general paralysis&quot;, which in that period &quot;suggested not only syphilis but nervous exhaustion&quot;. Langworth also states that there is &quot;no evidence that Roose or Buzzard treated Lord Randolph with mercury or potassium iodide&quot;, arguing that &quot;their toxic effects, such as a distinctive grey pallor, would have been evident.&quot;

==Career==
===The &quot;Fourth Party&quot;===
It was not until 1878 that he came to public notice as the exponent of independent Conservatism. He made a series of furious attacks on Sir Stafford Northcote, R. A. Cross, and other prominent members of the &quot;old gang&quot;. George Sclater-Booth (afterwards 1st Baron Basing), President of the Local Government Board, was a specific target, and the minister&#x27;s County Government Bill was fiercely denounced as the &quot;crowning dishonour to Tory principles&quot;, and the &quot;supreme violation of political honesty&quot;. Lord Randolph&#x27;s attitude, and the vituperative fluency of his invective, made him a parliamentary figure of some importance before the dissolution of the 1874 parliament, though he was not yet taken quite seriously, owing to his high-pitched hysterical laugh.

In the new parliament of 1880 he speedily began to play a more notable role. Along with Henry Drummond Wolff, John Gorst and occasionally Arthur Balfour, he made himself known as the audacious opponent of the Liberal administration and the unsparing critic of the Conservative front bench. The &quot;fourth party&quot;, as it was nicknamed, at first did little damage to the government, but awakened the opposition from its apathy; Churchill roused the Conservatives by leading resistance to Charles Bradlaugh, the member for Northampton, who as an avowed atheist or agnostic was prepared to take the parliamentary oath only under protest. Stafford Northcote, the Conservative leader in the Lower House, was forced to take a strong line on this difficult question by the energy of the fourth party.

The controversy over Bradlaugh&#x27;s seat showed that Lord Randolph Churchill was a parliamentary champion who added to his audacity much tactical skill and shrewdness. He continued to play a conspicuous part throughout the parliament of 1880–85, targeting William Ewart Gladstone as well as the Conservative front bench, some of whose members, particularly Sir Richard Cross and William Henry Smith, he singled out for attack when they opposed the reduced Army estimates. This would be the ostensible cause for his resignation because Salisbury failed to support his Chancellor in cabinet. They opposed his unionist politics of &#x27;economising&#x27; by Tory tradition, making Randolph grow to hate cabinet meetings.

From the beginning of the Egyptian imbroglio Lord Randolph was emphatically opposed to almost every step taken by the government. He declared that the suppression of Urabi Pasha&#x27;s rebellion was an error, and the restoration of the khedive&#x27;s authority a crime. He called Gladstone the &quot;Moloch of Midlothian&quot;, for whom torrents of blood had been shed in Africa. He was equally severe on the domestic policy of the administration, and was particularly bitter in his criticism of the Kilmainham Treaty and the rapprochement between the Gladstonians and the Parnellites.

===Tory Democracy===

By 1885 he had formulated the policy of progressive Conservatism which was known as &quot;Tory Democracy&quot;. He declared that the Conservatives ought to adopt, rather than oppose, popular reforms, and to challenge the claims of the Liberals to pose as champions of the masses. His views were largely accepted by the official Conservative leaders in the treatment of the Gladstonian Representation of the People Act 1884. Lord Randolph insisted that the principle of the bill should be accepted by the opposition, and that resistance should be focused on the refusal of the government to combine with it a scheme of redistribution. The prominent, and on the whole judicious and successful, part he played in the debates on these questions, still further increased his influence with the rank and file of the Conservatives in the constituencies.

At the same time he was actively spreading his gospel of democratic Toryism in a series of platform campaigns. In 1883 and 1884 he went to the radical stronghold of Birmingham, and in the latter year took part in a Conservative garden party at Aston Manor, at which his opponents paid him the compliment of raising a serious riot. He gave constant attention to the party organisation, which had fallen into considerable disorder after 1880, and was an active promoter of the Primrose League, which owed its origin to the inspiration of one of his own “fourth party” colleagues.

===Central Office and National Union===
In 1884 progressive Toryism won. At the conference of the National Union of Conservative Associations, Lord Randolph was nominated chairman, despite the opposition of the parliamentary leaders. A split was averted by Lord Randolph&#x27;s voluntary resignation which he had done his best to engineer; but the episode had confirmed his title to a leading place in the Tory ranks.

He built up Tory Democracy in the towns reinforcing the urban middle classes&#x27; part in the party, while simultaneously including a working-class element. His unsuccessful bid for the party leadership was inextricably part of the National Union&#x27;s attempt to control the party organization. It had originally been founded by Tory peers to organize propaganda to attract working men&#x27;s votes, registration, choose candidates, conduct elections; associations were linked to provincial unions. Lord Randolph was not the originator but his campaign of 1884 encouraged the leadership to improve on their designs. For the first time since 1832 the Conservatives won in the majority of English boroughs in November 1885.

It was strengthened by the prominent part he played in the events immediately preceding the fall of the Liberal government in 1885; and when Hugh Childers&#x27;s budget resolutions were defeated by the Conservatives, aided by about half the Parnellites, Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s admirers were justified in proclaiming him to have been the &quot;organiser of victory&quot;.

===Secretary of State for India===
In Lord Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;caretaker&quot; cabinet of 1885, Churchill was appointed Secretary of State for India, assuming office on 24June 1885. As the price of entry he demanded that Sir Stafford Northcote be removed from the Commons, despite being the Conservative leader there. Salisbury was more than willing to concede this, and Northcote went to the Lords as the Earl of Iddlesleigh.

Despite entering office with a reputation for progressive views on India, Churchill &#x27;s tenure was, in the words of the historian and biographer R.F. Foster, &#x27;traditionally reactionary&#x27;, and many of his policies focused on exploiting, not developing India. He enthusiastically supported a trade policy which favoured British imports over Indian goods; increased spending on the Indian Army at the expense of public works such as railways, roads and irrigation (all sharply reduced under his secretaryship); and re-directed money which had been set aside for future famine relief to help balance his budget. His attitude towards the native Indians was similarly illiberal. He refused to allow reforms which would have increased Indian representation within the civil service and army, and, in a public speech at Birmingham, he infamously described a deputation to Britain by three Indian politicians, led by N. G. Chandavarkar, as the &#x27;three Bengalee baboos&#x27;.

However, Churchill&#x27;s most well-known act during his time at the India Office was his role in the invasion and annexation of Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Siding with British commercial (especially cotton) and military interests, and hoping to boost Conservative fortunes in the upcoming general election, Churchill directed the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, to invade Upper Burma in November 1885. With little discussion, Churchill then decided to annex the Burmese kingdom, adding it as a new province of the Indian Raj as a &quot;New Year present&quot; for Queen Victoria on New Year&#x27;s Day 1886. Not only is the war itself widely regarded as a piece of blatant imperialism, but the continuing guerrilla war lasted into the later 1880s and cost the Indian taxpayer ten times Churchill&#x27;s original financial estimates.

In the autumn election of 1885 he contested Birmingham Central against John Bright, and though defeated here, was at the same time returned by a very large majority for South Paddington.

In the contest which arose over William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule bill, Lord Randolph again bore a conspicuous part, and in the electioneering campaign his activity was only second to that of some of the Liberal Unionists, Lord Hartington, George Goschen and Joseph Chamberlain. He was now the recognised Conservative champion in the Lower Chamber, and when the second Salisbury administration was formed after the general election of 1886 he became Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
At the end of his political career he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. 

However, he became a relatively isolated figure in the cabinet and did consult his supporters and building a base in Commons; instead, he decided to use public support to impose his positions on the Prime Minister in both domestic and foreign affairs. He decided to demonstrate to the public that the Conservatives could be as economical in budgetary matters as Gladstone had been. 

He proposed a budget with expenditure reductions that surprised and annoyed the Conservative MPs. They were willing to compromise, but he insisted on additional cuts in the Army and Navy that alarmed the service ministers. 

Churchill decided to threaten resignation but it proved to be one of the great blunders in British political history. In his resignation letter he stated that it was because he was unable as Chancellor to support the armed services. He expected his resignation to be followed by the unconditional surrender of the cabinet, and his restoration to office on his own terms. 

To Churchill&#x27;s surprise, Prime Minister Salisbury accepted the resignation, and Churchill was out in the cold. 

Goschen replaced him as Chancellor. For the next few years there was some speculation about a return to front-line politics, but Churchill&#x27;s own career was over. Even so, his economising ideas survived yet in the &quot;Dartford Programme&quot; of September 1886.

===After Chancellor===
Lord Randolph continued to sit in Parliament, his health was in serious decline throughout the 1890s. He was an ardent patron of horse racing; in 1889, his horse, L&#x27;Abbesse de Jouarre, won The Oaks. In 1891 he went to South Africa, in search both of health and relaxation. He travelled for some months through Cape Colony, the Transvaal and Rhodesia, making notes on the politics and economics of the countries, shooting lions, and recording his impressions in letters to a London newspaper, which were afterwards republished under the title of &quot;Men, Mines and Animals in South Africa&quot;. He attacked Gladstone&#x27;s Second Home Rule Bill for Ireland with energy, and gave fiery pro-Union speeches in Ireland. Referring to the possibility of a Home Rule Bill, Churchill stated that: &quot;...if Gladstone introduced a Home Rule Bill, I should not hesitate, if other circumstances were favourable, to agitate Ulster even to resistance beyond constitutional limits...&quot; During this time he coined the phrase &quot;Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right&quot;, echoing his earlier remark that in opposing Irish Home Rule &quot;the Orange card would be the one to play&quot;.

It was soon apparent that Churchill&#x27;s powers had been undermined by the illness which was to take his life at the age of 45. As the session of 1893 wore on, his speeches lost their old effectiveness. His last speech in the House was delivered in the debate on the East African Scheme in June 1894, and was a painful failure.

==Death==

Lord Randolph is said to have contracted syphilis from a chambermaid at the family seat of Blenheim Palace shortly after his marriage in 1874.

Randolph attempted a round-the-world journey in the autumn of 1894, accompanied by his wife, but his health soon became so feeble that he was brought back hurriedly from Cairo. He reached England shortly before Christmas, and died in Westminster the next month. The gross value of his personal estate was entered in the Probate Registry at £75,971 (). He is buried near his wife and sons at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

His widow, Lady Randolph Churchill, married George Cornwallis-West in 1900, when she became known as Mrs George Cornwallis-West. After that marriage was dissolved, she resumed by deed poll her prior married name, Lady Randolph Churchill. (Lord Randolph was her husband&#x27;s courtesy title as the younger son of a duke and in English law does not qualify as a noble title in its own right). Lord Randolph&#x27;s son, Sir Winston Churchill, died on 24 January 1965, aged 90, exactly 70 years after the death of his father, having lived twice as long.

==Personality and reputation==

Rosebery described his old friend and political opponent, after his death, thus: &quot;his nervous system was always tense and highly strung; ...he seems to have had no knowledge of men, no consideration of their feelings, no give and take.&quot; But he continued, &quot;in congenial society, his conversation was wholly delightful. He would then display his mastery of pleasant irony and banter; for with those playthings he was at his best.&quot;

Biographer Roy Jenkins, pointing to his brash and slightly vulgar charisma, asked, &quot;Was he ever near to being a serious statesman?&quot;:

Undoubtedly, he had some high political talents. He had a gift for mordant, wounding, sometimes very funny phrases. And, having thought up the most outrageous attack he had the nerve to deliver it, without fear of offending taste or friends or damaging his own repute...He was strong on insolence. He also had other attributes necessary to make his words resound, and his fame increase: a mnemonic name, an idiosyncratic appearance, and good delivery, whether on the platform or in the House of Commons. In addition he had sporadic charm, although intermingled with offensive and often pointless rudeness.

Jenkins compares his youth to that of William Pitt the Younger: &quot;Pitt was Prime Minister for 19 of his 46 years. Churchill had 11 months in office and was without rival in attracting so much attention and achieving so little.&quot;

==Film, television and literary depictions==
In the ITV historical drama series &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot;, Lord Randolph (played by Derek Fowlds) is featured as a more natural character, sociably similar to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and his other friends. His downfall is represented when he confronts Alexandra, Princess of Wales and demands she use her influence with the Prince to stop Lord Aylesford proceeding with a divorce from his wife, Lady Aylesford, after she had planned to elope with Lord Randolph&#x27;s elder brother, the Marquess of Blandford. He threatens to expose letters from the Prince to Lady Aylesford, so scandalous, so he says, that if they were to be exposed, &quot;the Prince of Wales would never sit on the throne of England.&quot;

Outraged, the Princess goes to see the Queen, who is equally indignant. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli informs the Prince, who is so angry that he challenges Lord Randolph to a duel in the South of France. Eventually, Lord Aylesford does not attempt to seek a divorce from his wife, and Lord Blandford does not elope with Lady Aylesford. Lord Randolph sends a note of apology to the Prince, which is merely acknowledged. Disgraced, Lord Randolph and his wife leave for America.

Other notable appearances include the film &quot;Young Winston&quot;, in which he was portrayed by Robert Shaw, and the miniseries &quot;&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor Ronald Pickup, as the English aristocrat who falls in love with the daughter of a very wealthy American property developer.

Sir Winston referred to his father&#x27;s career in several of the last chapters of &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;, written in Winston&#x27;s &#x27;wilderness years&#x27; in the inter-war years before he was recalled to the cabinet.

===Fiction===
* The alternate history novel &quot;Fight and Be Right&quot; (by Ed Thomas), traces Churchill&#x27;s further political rise in a world where his brother, the Marquess of Blandford, loses the scandalous letter between the Prince of Wales and Lady Aylesford, resulting in their father, the Duke of Marlborough, not being promoted to Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Randolph free of the scandal from the affair to rise further through the party ranks and become prime minister.

<text>Alexander Hamilton Stephens (February 11, 1812 – March 4, 1883) was an American politician who served as the first and only vice president of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865, and later as the 50th governor of Georgia from 1882 until his death in 1883. A member of the Democratic Party, he represented the state of Georgia in the United States House of Representatives before and after the Civil War.

Stephens attended Franklin College and established a legal practice in his hometown of Crawfordville, Georgia. After serving in both houses of the Georgia General Assembly, he won election to Congress, taking his seat in 1843. He became a leading Southern Whig and strongly opposed the Mexican–American War. After the war, Stephens was a prominent supporter of the Compromise of 1850 and helped draft the Georgia Platform, which opposed secession. A proponent of the expansion of slavery into the territories, Stephens also helped pass the Kansas–Nebraska Act. As the Whig Party collapsed in the 1850s, Stephens eventually joined the Democratic Party and worked with President James Buchanan to admit Kansas as a state under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution (which was overwhelmingly rejected by voters in a referendum in that state).

Stephens declined to seek re-election in 1858 but continued to publicly advocate against secession. After Georgia and other Southern states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, Stephens was elected as the Confederate Vice President. Stephens&#x27;s Cornerstone Speech of March 1861 defended slavery; enumerated contrasts between the American and Confederate foundings, ideologies, and constitutions; and laid out the Confederacy&#x27;s rationale for seceding. In the course of the war, he became increasingly critical of President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s policies, especially Confederate conscription and the suspension of habeas corpus. In February 1865, he was one of the commissioners who met with Abraham Lincoln at the abortive Hampton Roads Conference to discuss peace terms.

After the war, Stephens was imprisoned until October 1865. The following year, the Georgia legislature elected Stephens to the U.S. Senate, but the Senate declined to seat him due to his role in the Civil War. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1873 and held that office until 1882, when he resigned from Congress to become governor of Georgia. Stephens served as governor until his death in March 1883.

==Early life==

Alexander Stephens was born on February 11, 1812. His parents were Andrew Baskins Stephens and Margaret Grier. The Stephenses lived on a farm in Taliaferro County, near Crawfordville. At the time of Alexander Stephens&#x27;s birth, the farm was part of Wilkes County. Taliaferro County was created in 1825 from land in Greene, Hancock, Oglethorpe, Warren, and Wilkes counties. His father, a native of Pennsylvania, came to Georgia at 12 years of age, in 1795. According to the &quot;Biographical Sketch of Linton Stephens&quot; (Linton Stephens being Alexander Stephens&#x27;s half-brother), Andrew B. Stephens was &quot;endowed with uncommon intellectual faculties; he had sound practical judgment; he was a safe counselor, sagacious, self-reliant, candid and courageous.&quot;

His mother, a Georgia native and sister of &quot;Grier&#x27;s Almanac&quot; founder Robert Grier, died in 1812 at the age of 26; Alexander Stephens was only three months old. In the introduction to &quot;Recollections of Alexander H. Stephens&quot;, there is this about his mother and her family: &quot;Margaret came of folk who had a liking for books, and a turn for law, war, and meteorology.&quot; The introduction continues: &quot;In her son&#x27;s character was a marked blending of parental traits. He [Alexander Stephens] was thrifty, generous, progressive; one of the best lawyers in the land; a reader and collector of books; a close observer of the weather, and father of the Weather Bureau of the United States.&quot; In 1814, Andrew B. Stephens married Matilda Lindsay, daughter of Revolutionary War Colonel John Lindsay.

In May 1826, when Alexander Stephens was age 14, his father Andrew and stepmother Matilda died of pneumonia only days apart. Their deaths caused him and several siblings to be scattered among relatives. He grew up poor and in difficult circumstances. Not long after the deaths of his father and his stepmother, Alexander Stephens was sent to live with his mother&#x27;s other brother, General Aaron W. Grier, near Raytown (Taliaferro County), Georgia. General Grier had inherited his own father&#x27;s library, said to be &quot;the largest library in all that part of the country.&quot; Alexander Stephens, who read voraciously even as a youth, mentions the library in his &quot;Recollections.&quot;

Frail but precocious, the young Stephens acquired his continued education through the generosity of several benefactors. One of them was the Presbyterian minister Alexander Hamilton Webster, who presided over a school in Washington, Georgia. Out of respect for his mentor, Stephens adopted Webster&#x27;s middle name, Hamilton, as his own. Stephens attended Franklin College (later the University of Georgia) in Athens, Georgia, where he was roommates with Crawford W. Long and a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. He raised funds for Phi Kappa Hall, located on the university campus. Stephens graduated at the top of his class in 1832.

==Early career==
After several unhappy years teaching in school, Stephens began legal studies, was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1834, and began a successful career as a lawyer in Crawfordville. During his 32 years of practice, he gained a reputation as a capable defender of the wrongfully accused. None of his clients charged with capital crimes were executed. As his wealth increased, Stephens began acquiring land and slaves. By the time of the Civil War, Stephens owned 34 slaves and several thousand acres. He entered politics in 1836 and was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, serving there until 1841. In 1842, he was elected to the Georgia Senate.

Stephens served in the U.S. House of Representatives from October 2, 1843, to March 3, 1859, from the 28th Congress through the 35th Congress. In 1843, he was elected to the House as a Whig, in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mark A. Cooper. This seat was at-large, as Georgia did not have U.S. House Districts until the following year. Stephens was re-elected from the 7th District as a Whig in 1844, 1846 and 1848, as a Unionist in 1850, and again as a Whig (from the 8th District) in 1852. In 1854 and 1856, his re-elections came as a Democrat. As a national lawmaker during the crucial decades before the Civil War, Stephens was involved in all of the major sectional battles. He began as a moderate defender of slavery but later accepted the prevailing Southern rationale utilized to defend the institution.

Stephens quickly rose to prominence as one of the leading Southern Whigs in the House. He supported the annexation of Texas in 1845. Along with his fellow Whigs, he vehemently opposed the Mexican–American War, and later became an equally vigorous opponent of the Wilmot Proviso, which would have barred the extension of slavery into territories that were acquired after the war. He also controversially tabled the Clayton Compromise, which would have excluded slavery from the Oregon Territory and left the issue of slavery in New Mexico and California to the U.S. Supreme Court. This would later nearly kill Stephens when he argued with Georgia Supreme Court Justice Francis H. Cone, who stabbed him repeatedly in a fit of anger. Stephens was physically outmatched by his larger assailant, but he remained defiant during the attack, refusing to recant his positions even at the cost of his life. Only the intervention of others saved him. Stephens&#x27;s wounds were serious, and he returned home to Crawfordville to recover. He and Cone reconciled before Cone&#x27;s death in 1859.

Stephens and fellow Georgia Representative Robert Toombs campaigned for the election of Zachary Taylor as president in 1848. Both were chagrined and angered when Taylor proved less than pliable on aspects of the Compromise of 1850. After Taylor supported the ratification of New Mexico&#x27;s anti-slavery state constitution and threatened to send troops to defend it against Texas&#x27;s territorial claims, Stephens published an open letter in the &quot;National Intelligencer&quot; calling for Taylor&#x27;s impeachment, and he warned that if the United States were to fire the first shots against Texas it would lead to the Southern states to secede from the Union. Stephens and Toombs both supported said compromise between slave and free states, though they opposed the exclusion of slavery from the territories on the theory that such lands belonged to all of the people. The pair returned from the District of Columbia to Georgia to secure support for the measures at home. Both men were instrumental in the drafting and approval of the Georgia Platform, which rallied Unionists throughout the Deep South.
Stephens and Toombs were not only political allies but also lifelong friends. Stephens was described as &quot;a highly sensitive young man of serious and joyless habits of consuming ambition, of poverty-fed pride, and of morbid preoccupation within self,&quot; a contrast to the &quot;robust, wealthy, and convivial Toombs. But this strange camaraderie endured with singular accord throughout their lives.&quot;

By this time, Stephens had departed the ranks of the Whig party, whose Northern wing generally was not amenable to some Southern interests. Back in Georgia, Stephens, Toombs and Democratic U.S. Representative Howell Cobb formed the Constitutional Union Party. The party overwhelmingly carried the state in the ensuing election, and, for the first time Stephens returned to Congress no longer a Whig. Stephens spent the next few years as a Constitutional Unionist. He vigorously opposed the dismantling of the Constitutional Union Party when it began crumbling in 1851. Political realities soon forced the Union Democrats in the party to affiliate once more with the national party, and, by mid-1852, the combination of both Democrats and Whigs, which had formed a party behind the Compromise, had ended.

The sectional issue surged to the forefront again in 1854, when Senator Stephen A. Douglas from Illinois moved to organize the Nebraska Territory, all of which lay north of the Missouri Compromise line, in the Kansas–Nebraska Act. This legislation aroused fury in the North because it applied the popular sovereignty principle to the Territory, in violation of the Missouri Compromise. Had it not been for Stephens, the bill probably never would have passed in the House. He employed an obscure House rule to bring the bill to a vote. He later called this &quot;the greatest glory of my life.&quot;

From this point on, Stephens voted with the Democrats. Until after 1855, Stephens could not be properly called a Democrat, and even then, he never officially declared it. In this move, Stephens broke irrevocably with many of his former Whig colleagues. When the Whig Party disintegrated after the election of 1852, some Whigs flocked to the short-lived Know-Nothing Party, but Stephens fiercely opposed the Know Nothings both for their secrecy and their anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic position.

Despite his late arrival in the Democratic Party, Stephens quickly rose through the ranks. He even served as President James Buchanan&#x27;s floor manager in the House during the fruitless battle for the slave state Lecompton Constitution for Kansas Territory in 1857. He was instrumental in framing the failed English Bill after it became clear that Lecompton would not pass in order to negotiate the approval.

Stephens did not seek re-election to Congress in 1858. As sectional peace eroded during the next two years, Stephens became increasingly critical of Southern extremists. Although virtually the entire South had spurned Douglas as a traitor to Southern rights because he had opposed the Lecompton Constitution and broken with Buchanan, Stephens remained on good terms with Douglas and even served as one of his presidential electors in the election of 1860.

On November 14, 1860, Stephens delivered a speech titled &quot;The Assertions of a Secessionist.&quot; He said:

On the eve of the outbreak of the American Civil War, Stephens counseled delay in moving militarily against U.S.-held Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens so that the Confederacy could build up its forces and stock resources.

==Vice President of the Confederate States==

In 1861, Stephens was elected as a delegate to the Georgia Secession Convention to decide Georgia&#x27;s response to the election of Abraham Lincoln. During the convention, as well as during the 1860 presidential campaign, Stephens, who came to be known as &quot;the sage of Liberty Hall&quot;, called for the South to remain loyal to the Union, likening it to a leaking but fixable boat. During the convention he reminded his fellow delegates that Republicans were a minority in Congress (especially in the Senate) and, even with a Republican president, they would be forced to compromise just as the two sections had for decades. Because the Supreme Court had voted 7–2 in the Dred Scott case, it took decades of Senate-approved appointments to reverse it. He voted against secession in the convention but asserted the right to secede if the federal government continued allowing Northern states to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law with &quot;personal liberty laws.&quot; He was elected to the Confederate Congress and was chosen by the Congress as vice president of the provisional government. He took the provisional oath of office on February 11, 1861, then the &#x27;full term&#x27; oath of office on February 22, 1862 (after being elected in November 1861) and served until his arrest on May 11, 1865. Stephens officially served in office eight days longer than President Jefferson Davis; he took his oath seven days before Davis&#x27;s inauguration and was captured the day after Davis.
In 1862, Stephens first publicly expressed his opposition to the Davis administration. Throughout the war he denounced many of the president&#x27;s policies, including conscription, suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, impressment, various financial and taxation policies, and Davis&#x27;s military strategy.

In mid-1863, Davis dispatched Stephens on a fruitless mission to Washington, D.C., to discuss prisoner exchanges, but the Union victory of Gettysburg made the Lincoln administration refuse to receive him. As the war continued and the fortunes of the Confederacy sank lower, Stephens became more outspoken in his opposition to the administration. On March 16, 1864, Stephens delivered a speech to the Georgia Legislature that was widely reported in both the North and the South. In it, he excoriated the Davis Administration for its support of conscription and suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and supported a block of resolutions aimed at securing peace. From then until the end of the war, as he continued to press for actions aimed at bringing about peace, his relations with Davis, never warm to begin with, turned completely sour.

On February 3, 1865, Stephens was one of three Confederate commissioners who met with Lincoln on the steamer &quot;River Queen&quot; at the Hampton Roads Conference, a fruitless effort to discuss measures to bring an end to the fighting. Stephens and Lincoln had been close friends and Whig political allies in the 1840s. Although peace terms were not reached, Lincoln did agree to look into the whereabouts of Stephens&#x27;s nephew, Confederate Lieutenant John A. Stephens. When Lincoln returned to Washington, he ordered the release of Lieutenant Stephens.

Stephens was arrested for treason against the United States at his home in Crawfordville, on May 11, 1865. He was imprisoned in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor, for five months until October 1865.

== Cornerstone Speech ==

Stephens&#x27;s Cornerstone Speech on March 21, 1861, to &quot;The Savannah Theatre&quot; is frequently cited in historical analysis of Confederate ideology. The speech defended slavery; enumerated contrasts between the American and Confederate foundings, ideologies and constitutions; and laid out the Confederacy&#x27;s rationale for seceding. Historian Keith S. Hébert describes it as &quot;the most significant speech&quot; ever delivered by Stephens. It declared that disagreements over the enslavement of Africans were the &quot;immediate cause&quot; of secession and that the Confederate constitution had resolved such issues. 
Stephens contended that advances and progress in the sciences proved that the United States Declaration of Independence&#x27;s view that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; was erroneous. His speech criticized &quot;most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution&quot; for their views on slavery, stating that: Stephens proceeded to state that in contrast to the United States:Criticizing the position of Northern evangelicals who were opposed to slavery, Stephens quoted the Psalm 118:22 and Curse of Ham to biblically justify the institution, and stated that:

Concluding:

After the Confederacy&#x27;s defeat, Stephens attempted to retroactively deny and retract the opinions he had stated in the speech. Denying his earlier statements that slavery was the Confederacy&#x27;s cause for leaving the Union, he contended to the contrary that he thought that the war was rooted in constitutional differences; this explanation by Stephens is widely rejected by historians. Hébert states that &quot;the speech haunted Stephens to the grave and beyond as he and other postbellum southern Democrats struggled to conceal the clear meaning of his words under the camouflage of a Lost Cause mythology.&quot;

==Later life==

In 1866, Stephens was elected to the United States Senate by the first legislature convened under the new Georgia State Constitution but was not allowed to take his seat because of restrictions on former Confederates. He published a U.S. history in 1868–1870, laying out the Lost Cause of the Confederacy in his view: that secession was legal, and that Northern States were the aggressors in this conflict. The thrust of his legal argument was rejected by the Supreme Court in the 1869 case &quot;Texas v. White&quot;, ruling secession to be unconstitutional.

In 1873, Stephens was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat from the 8th District to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Ambrose R. Wright. He was re-elected to the 8th District as an Independent Democrat in 1874, 1876 and 1878, and as a Democrat again in 1880. He described himself, on the title page of the 1876 edition of his &quot;Compendium&quot;, as &quot;Professor Elect of History and Political Science at the University of Georgia.&quot; He served in the 43rd through 47th Congresses, from December 1, 1873, until his resignation on November 4, 1882. On that date, he was elected and took office as governor of Georgia. His tenure as governor proved brief; Stephens died on March 4, 1883, four months after taking office.

Stephens was sickly throughout his life, most painfully from &quot;crippling rheumatoid arthritis and a pinched nerve in his back.&quot; Although his adult height was , he often weighed less than . Almost all of his former slaves continued to work for him, often for little or no money; whether this decision was voluntary or the result of few other options existing for former slaves in the Deep South is difficult to determine. These servants were with him upon his death. Although old and infirm, Stephens continued to work on his house and plantation. According to a former slave, a gate fell on Stephens while he and another black servant were repairing it, &quot;and he was crippled and lamed up from that time on till he died.&quot; The veracity of this rumor is difficult to determine as the cited ex-slave was not present when this happened.

While returning from a trip to Savannah in February, his already poor health further deteriorated from exposure to the elements. His last official act as governor was executed on 28 February. He died shortly before 3:30am on 4 March, surrounded by physicians and friends. That afternoon, commemorative speeches were made by &quot;prominent citizens&quot; in the Georgia Senate chamber. On 6 March, Stephens&#x27; body laid in state in the chamber. On 8 March, a grand funeral was held, and all citizens of the state were requested to observe the occasion.

In 1928, Judge Alex Stephens, a nephew, introduced Cyrus Stephens, the last surviving person who had been enslaved by Alexander Stephens, to Georgia governor L. G. Hardman.

==Personal life==
A lifelong bachelor, Stephens never married and never acknowledged direct descendants. An African American family claims to be the descendants of Stephens and a slave he owned, named Eliza; though their claims were not verified by genetic testing.

<text>A bodysuit is a one-piece form-fitting or skin-tight garment that covers the torso and the crotch. The design of a basic bodysuit is similar to a one-piece swimsuit and a leotard, though the materials may vary. Thong or T-front thong bodysuits usually have the crotch opening moved up to the front to underbelly area to increase the wearer&#x27;s comfort. A bodysuit may have sleeves and varying shoulder strap and collar. Bodysuits can be made from a number of fabrics, including cotton, lace, nylon, etc. In general, textile bodysuits include expandable fiber such as spandex for a better fit to the shape of the body.

A bodysuit is normally worn with trousers or a skirt. The top, torso part may act as a top for the smooth line it gives or because it cannot become untucked from trousers or skirt. They may also be worn generally by women as underwear, activewear, or foundation garments. Unlike a leotard, a bodysuit is not usually considered a form of athletic wear. 

Onesies (or snapsuits) are bodysuits with a buttoned-down opening at the crotch that help keep diapers in place. The opening helps facilitate access to a person&#x27;s diaper or visits to the toilet. These are almost exclusively worn by infants, but adult-sized versions have also become popular among certain kink subcultures.

There are also bodyshirts, like the counterpart to the bodysuit, they are loose-fitting garments that cover the whole torso, with sleeves in short to long lengths and crotch snaps. The difference is that they look like a shirt on the top portion of the garment, and may have a different stretch fabric in the waist to the crotch area to make them fit better. Long sleeved crew neck and turtleneck bodysuits are a common element of dancewear costumes.

==History==
The bodysuit was a progression from the leotard. It was presented in the United States after 1950 by fashion designer Claire McCardell. It was worn as a blouse or T-shirt. The first recognized bodysuit was worn by Bettie Page in the 1950s, and was a trademark attire of the Playboy Bunnies from the 1960s, as well as Wonder Woman in the animated series &quot;Super Friends&quot; and Lynda Carter&#x27;s television series. 

Azzedine Alaia and Donna Karan helped make the bodysuit a fashion item for both men, women and even tweens, teens, and young adult/college age in the 1980s to mid 1990s seen a lot in short cap sleeved or turtleneck versions worn in popular fashion as a top especially with high waisted jeans and also with regular and dress shorts and skirts. After a slowdown, it was resurrected as shaping underwear or lingerie, and in the 2010s it reappeared as a blouse bodysuit, cap sleeve, and classic turtleneck bodysuit, as well as a part of evening wear.

<doc id="309524" wikidata="Q729199" url="?curid=309524" title="Eni Faleomavaega">
<text>Eni Fa&#x27;aua&#x27;a Hunkin Faleomavaega Jr. ( ; August 15, 1943 – February 22, 2017) was an American Samoan politician and attorney who served as the territory&#x27;s third lieutenant governor, from 1985 to 1989 and non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives, from 1989 to 2015. As a delegate, Faleomavaega served on committees and spoke on the House floor; however, he was not permitted to vote on the final passage of any legislation. He also was the father-in-law of former professional American football fullback Fui Vakapuna.

Throughout his career, Faleomavaega was an advocate for greater autonomy and self-determination for American Samoa. He worked towards achieving a status of free association with the United States, similar to the relationship between the Cook Islands and New Zealand, to address what he referred to as &quot;colonial abuse&quot; in the territory. Additionally, he sought to diversify American Samoa&#x27;s economy to reduce its dependency on federal support. One of his legislative achievements included securing $4 million annually for scholarships enabling American Samoan students to attend colleges and universities in the United States.

==Personal life==
Eni Faleomavaega: His parents were Eni and Taualai Faaua’ā Hunkin. His father served as a member of the Fitafita Guard and later as a communications specialist for the U.S. Navy, a role that led the family to reside on Swains Island. Faleomavaega spent his early years on the islands of Tutuila and Swains. Following the U.S. Navy&#x27;s withdrawal from American Samoa in 1951, the family relocated to Lāʻie, Hawai’i.

In 1995, he authored &quot;Navigating the Future: A Samoan Perspective in U.S.-Pacific Relations&quot;, a book examining American Samoa’s political and social framework. In 1987, he participated in a significant cultural journey aboard the Hokule’a, a Polynesian voyaging canoe, sailing from Tahiti to Hawai’i.

The title &quot;Faleomavaega&quot; was conferred upon him by his Faiivae family in Leone. He married Hinanui Bambridge Cave of Papeete, French Polynesia, and they had five children.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Faleomavaega was born in Vailoatai, American Samoa and grew up in Oahu, Hawaii. He graduated from Kahuku High School and initially attended Church College of Hawaii (now Brigham Young University–Hawaii), where he completed his associate&#x27;s degree. He then transferred to Brigham Young University&#x27;s main campus in Utah and earned a B.A. in political science and history in 1966. He received his J.D. from the University of Houston Law Center in 1972 and LL.M. from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1973.

He served as an enlistee in the United States Army from 1966 to 1969, and as an officer in the United States Army Reserve from 1982 to 1989. He completed a tour in the Vietnam War and left the military with the rank of captain following his second term of service. He and his wife were active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Legal career==
Faleomavaega served as the administrative assistant to American Samoa Delegate A.U. Fuimaono from 1973 to 1975 and as staff counsel for the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1975 to 1981. He served as the Deputy Attorney General of American Samoa from 1981 to 1984.

==Political career==
He was a candidate in the inaugural election for American Samoa’s Delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1978. He ran alongside A. P. Lutali in the 1985 gubernatorial race, and served as Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa from 1985 to 1989. In 1987, he participated in an event that followed traditional Polynesian life experiences by sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii in a canoe. In 1988, he was elected as the Delegate to the U.S. Congress, a position he held through subsequent elections.

===Congressional delegate===

Faleomavaega was elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives in 1988, serving from January 3, 1989 until January 2015. As a delegate, he has worked to receive more federal funding for his home territory, particularly for health care and other essential services. He has opposed free trade deals involving meats and seafood, as nearly one-third of his territory&#x27;s population is involved in the tuna industry. He proposed legislation that would allow residents of US territories to vote in presidential elections if they are active duty members of the military. Faleomavaega also participated in a boycott of Jacques Chirac, who made a speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress in 1996, due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

===Committee assignments===
Faleomavaega was a member of the following committees in the House of Representatives:
*Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and the Global Environment (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere
*Committee on Natural Resources
**Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources
**Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs

===Caucuses===
*Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus

===Support for Sri Lanka&#x27;s war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam===
Faleomavaega has said that it is more opportune if the United States could refrain from interfering in internal affairs of Sri Lanka. He took the initiative of briefing members of the Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific of the US House of Representatives in this respect.

===Support for American Samoa&#x27;s independence===
In 2012, both Faleomavaega and Togiola Tulafono, American Samoa&#x27;s Governor, called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response.

===Support for Bahrain&#x27;s monarchy===
Faleomavaega was known for his vocal support of Bahrain&#x27;s monarchy during the Bahraini uprising. One of Faleomavaega&#x27;s top campaign donors, William Nixon, is a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist whose firm, Policy Impact Communications, founded the pro-monarchy Bahrain American Council. He has taken various paid trips to Bahrain to meet with that country&#x27;s rulers.

== Legacy ==

=== VA Clinic ===
On March 31, 2017, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 1362 into law. H.R. 1362 names the VA clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the &quot;Faleomavaega Eni Fa&#x27;aua&#x27;a Hunkin VA Clinic.&quot; The bill was sponsored by Delegate Amata Coleman Radewagen, Faleomavaega&#x27;s successor as representative from American Samoa, and co-sponsored by five others.

==Death==
Faleomavaega suffered from complications that he said are from his exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Voters&#x27; concerns about his health are speculated to have contributed to his 2014 election defeat.

Faleomavaega died at the age of 73 on Wednesday, February 22, 2017. The cause was not specified. He was survived by his wife, 5 children, and 10 grandchildren.

<text>Midwest Christian Outreach, Inc (MCOI), is a non-denominational, conservative evangelical organization. It is a Chicago support group that encourages people to leave cults or groups they deem cult-like and &quot;an apologetics ministry in suburban Chicago.&quot;

It has branches in Lohrville, Iowa; Salisbury, North Carolina; Scranton, Kansas; and Spring Hill, Florida.

Its mission statement: &quot;Midwest Christian Outreach, Inc., is a non-denominational, evangelical organization that exists to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ, especially to those who consciously reject it due to what MCO deems &#x27;false beliefs&#x27;, and to challenge and equip believing Christians to do the same&quot;.
MCOI is headed by Don Veinot, who is a former atheist, who acts as president. His wife and three others serve as board members of the organization. &quot;Religion Dispatches&quot; credits Veinot as the founder of MCOI. Founders Ministries credits Veinot and his wife as co-founders of MCOI.

Since 1995, MCOI has produced a self-published journal which is mailed out three to four times a year with a circulation of under 2,000. It is also available online in Adobe PDF format called the &quot;Midwest Christian Outreach Journal&quot;. The journal consists of three or four articles each issue, with either Don Veinot or his wife writing at least one article each time, and a small group of other like-minded conservatives that are frequent contributors.

Midwest Christian Outreach is based in Wonder Lake, Illinois.

<text>Direct Stream Digital (DSD) is a trademark used by Sony and Philips for their system for digitally encoding audio signals for the Super Audio CD (SACD).

DSD uses delta-sigma modulation, a form of pulse-density modulation encoding, a technique to represent audio signals in digital format, a sequence of single-bit values at a sampling rate of 2.8224 MHz. This is 64 times the CD audio sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, but with 1-bit samples instead of 16-bit samples. Noise shaping of the 64-times oversampled signal provides low quantization noise and low distortion in the audible bandwidth necessary for high resolution audio.

DSD is simply a format for storing a delta-sigma signal without applying a decimation process that converts the signal to a PCM signal.

==Development==
DSD technology was developed and commercialized by Sony and Philips, the designers of the audio CD. However, in 2005, Philips sold its DSD tool division to Sonic Studio.

;Major label support
DVD-Audio was endorsed by the Warner Music Group, while the SACD format was endorsed by Sony and Universal Music Group, with an especially high-profile by UMG imprint Virgin Records. Despite this, in 2011, &quot;The Warner Premium Sound series&quot; of albums was released by Warner Music Group, marking the first time the label released titles in a SACD format, with recording in DSD. The series grew to ten rock and pop albums, with Super Audio CD/CD hybrid discs containing both an SACD layer and a standard CD layer.

Sony did not promote SACD actively in North America, with the result that DVD-Audio gained competitive traction in the market. Elsewhere, such as in Europe or Japan, SACD gained more of a foothold. Examples include the German Stockfisch Records, which releases vinyl editions of albums and DSD-recordings, released as hybrid SACDs.

;Independent label use
Music companies that specialize in Super Audio CD products therefore use DSD encoding. A number of independent record labels have also worked directly with Sony to focus on DSD products or the DSD recording process.

DMP Digital Music Products was an early user of the SACD digital audio format. In 1997 their release &quot;Alto&quot; by Joe Beck &amp; Ali Ryerson was the first commercial recording captured with Sony&#x27;s DSD recording technology. The label&#x27;s &quot;Just Jobim&quot; by Manfredo Fest in 1998 was the first project captured with the new Meitner DSD conversion technology. In 2000, DMP released the world&#x27;s first multi-channel SACD—&quot;Sacred Feast&quot; by Gaudeamus.

The majority of Telarc International Corporation&#x27;s releases were on (generally hybrid) SACD, and are DSD recordings. Telarc often worked with early audiophile company Soundstream, and re-released many of its original Soundstream recordings in SACD format. Soundstream, which made the first digital recording in the United States, recorded in 16-bit PCM at a sample rate of 50 kHz via its own proprietary digital recorder. This 50 kHz PCM format was converted to DSD for release on Telarc SACD.

The record label Mobile Fidelity had engineers who decided to adopt the SACD over the DVD-Audio disc as a favored high-resolution digital format after listening tests and technical evaluations. On the label&#x27;s Hybrid SACD releases, the SACD layer is a direct DSD recording of the analog master tape, while the CD layer is a digital down conversion of the DSD, with Super Bit Mapping applied. Post-2001, CD-only releases are sourced from DSD, but omit the SACD layer.

In 2007, Blue Coast Records was founded in California for the purpose of recording and releasing music recorded with the DSD format, primarily focusing on jazz and acoustic artists.

On August 28, 2013, the Acoustic Sounds label launched SuperHiRez.com (now defunct), which sold mainstream albums from major record labels that were produced with Direct Stream Digital or PCM audio formats. On September 4, 2013, Acoustic Sounds announced an agreement with Sony Music Entertainment to provide the company&#x27;s new digital download service with albums that have been produced or remastered in DSD format.

The format is used on albums such as &quot;Pop, Songs &amp; Death&quot; in 2009, and the remastered The Rolling Stones album &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; in 2002.

==DSD signal format==
DSD differs from the PCM format used by compact disc or typical computer audio systems: while PCM uses a multi-bit value (representing a large range of amplitudes) at a low sample rate, DSD instead uses a single-bit value (representing an increase or decrease in amplitude) at a sample rate much higher than the signal&#x27;s bandwidth.

The process of creating a DSD signal is the same as the front-end modulator and noise-shaper portion of a 1-bit delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter (ADC), without the back end decimator (which would typically convert the 1-bit bitstream into multi-bit PCM). The short-term average of the 1-bit DSD bitstream signal is proportional to the original signal amplitude. Because of the higher sample rate, an SACD player can use a one-bit DAC with a low-order analog filter to reconstruct and produce the analog output.

DSD uses noise shaping techniques to push quantization noise up to inaudible ultrasonic frequencies. Because of this, single rate DSD64 can deliver a dynamic range of 120 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and an extended frequency response up to 100 kHz (most recent SACD players specify an upper limit of 80 to 90 kHz).

The various DSD formats use sampling rates well into the megahertz (MHz) range, typically with an &quot;oversampling ratio&quot; that is a power of two relative to the 44.1 kHz rate used for CD audio:
See for analysis of the effective number of bits that can be achieved by oversampling, especially when using a higher order modulator.

==DSD mixing and mastering==
DSD music mixing and mastering for SACD or Internet download presents challenges due to the difficulty of performing digital signal processing (DSP) operations (such as equalization, balance, panning) in a one-bit environment.

Older analog recordings were processed using analog equipment and then digitized to DSD. It is also possible to avoid processing by using only the available adjustments in the studio equipment while recording to DSD.

One DSP technique available is to convert the DSD to PCM and use standard PCM equipment such as Pro Tools, useful for rock and contemporary music which rely on multitrack techniques, then digitally convert back to DSD format. Some DSD proponents dislike this technique claiming that the PCM conversion to a lower sample rate reduces the sound quality of DSD.

A format and set of tools for PCM processing of DSD has been developed under the name Digital eXtreme Definition (DXD). This is a PCM format with 24-bit resolution sampled at 352.8 kHz. Another DSP technique uses a format commonly referred to as &quot;DSD-wide&quot;, which retains the high sample rate of standard DSD, but uses 8-bit samples with noise shaping. DSD-wide is sometimes disparagingly referred to as &quot;PCM-narrow&quot;. It has the benefit of making DSP operations practical while retaining the 2.8224 MHz sampling frequency. The processed DSD-wide signal is converted to the final 1-bit DSD product at the same sample rate. Processing DSD-wide at the higher multiple-DSD sample rates is also possible. Pyramix and some SADiE digital audio workstation (DAW) systems can operate in the DSD-wide domain.

===DSD processing tools===
DXD was initially developed for the Merging Technologies Pyramix workstation and introduced together with their Sphynx 2, AD/DA converter in 2004. This combination meant that it was possible to record and edit directly in DXD, and that the sample only converts to DSD once before publishing. This offers an advantage to the user as the noise created by converting DSD rises dramatically above 20 kHz, and more noise is added each time a signal is converted back to DSD during editing.

The Pyramix Virtual Studio Digital Audio Workstation allows for recording, editing and mastering all DSD formats up to DSD256. A 12.288 MHz DSD256 variant based on a 48 kHz reference is supported. The exaSound e20 DAC was the first commercially available device capable of DSD256 playback at sampling rates of 11.2896 or 12.288 MHz. The Merging Technologies Horus AD/DA Converter offers sample rates up to 11.2 MHz, or four times the SACD rate.

DSD128, 5.6448 MHz, twice the SACD rate, has been supported by multiple hardware devices such as the exaSound e20 Mk II DA,C Korg MR-1000 1-bit digital recorder, Amanero Combo384 DSD output adapter and the discontinued exaU2I USB to I²S interface. 

Software supporting DSD includes Sonic Studio&#x27;s Amarra Luxe, Audirvana, foobar2000 with SACD plugin, JRiver Media Center, Roon, HQPlayer and Neutron Music Player are all able to handle DSD files of up to DSD512 rate fully natively.

==DSD playback options==
Sony developed DSD for SACD, and many disk players support SACD. Since the format is digital, there are other ways to play back a DSD stream; the development of these alternatives has enabled companies to offer high-quality music downloads in DSD.

===DSD disc format===
Some professional audio recorders (from Korg, Tascam, and others) can record in DSD format. Transferring this signal to a recordable DVD with the appropriate tools, such as the AudioGate software bundled with Korg MR-2000S recorder, renders a &quot;DSD Disc&quot;. Such discs can be played back in native DSD only on certain Sony VAIO laptops and PlayStation 3 systems. Sony produced two SACD players, the SCD-XA5400ES and the SCD-XE800, that fully support the DSD-disc format. In June 2012, Pioneer launched a series of SACD players compatible with DSD-disc. The PD-30 and PD-50. In January 2013, TEAC announced a DSD-disc compatible player, the PD-501HR.

===DSD over USB===
An alternative to burning DSD files onto disks for eventual playback is to transfer the (non-encrypted) files from a computer to audio hardware over a digital link such as USB. The USB audio 2.0 specification defined several formats for the more common PCM approach to digital audio, but did not define a format for DSD.

In 2012, representatives from many companies and others developed a standard to represent and detect DSD audio within PCM frames; the standard, commonly known as DSD over PCM (DoP), is suitable for other digital links that use PCM. The 1.1 revision added protocol support for higher DSD sample rates without requiring an increase the underlying PCM sample rate.

===Native DSD===
The definition of &quot;native DSD&quot; playback is somewhat a matter of philosophy. Generally speaking, it avoids the conversion of DSD data into multibit PCM anywhere along the reproduction chain. Many commercially available DACs now support &quot;native DSD&quot;.

==DSD vs. PCM==
There has been much controversy between proponents of DSD and PCM over which encoding system is superior. In 2000, Lipshitz and Vanderkooy stated that one-bit converters, as employed by DSD, are unsuitable for high-end applications due to their high distortion. In 2002, Philips published a paper arguing the contrary. Lipshitz and Vanderkooy&#x27;s paper was further criticized by Angus. Lipshitz and Vanderkooy responded to the criticisms. Stuart also defined sigma-delta modulation a &quot;totally unsuitable choice&quot; for high-resolution digital audio.

Conventional implementation of DSD has an intrinsic high distortion. Distortion can be alleviated to some degree by using multibit DACs. State-of-the-art ADCs are based around sigma-delta modulation designs. Oversampling converters are usually used in linear PCM formats, where the ADC or DAC output is subject to bandlimiting and dithering. Most modern ADC and DAC converters use oversampling and a multi-bit design; in other words, while DSD is a 1-bit format, modern converters internally use a 2-bit to 6-bit format.

Comparisons of DSD and PCM recordings with the same origin, number of channels and similar bandwidth and noise have yielded contradictory results. A 2004 study conducted at the Erich-Thienhaus Institute in Detmold, Germany found that in double-blind tests &quot;hardly any of the subjects could make a reproducible distinction between the two encoding systems.&quot; In contrast, a 2014 study conducted at the Tokyo University of the Arts found that listeners could distinguish PCM (192 kHz/24 bits) from either DSD (2.8 MHz) or DSD (5.6 MHz) (but not between the two DSD samplings), preferring the sound of DSD over PCM: &quot;For example, Drums stimulus of DSD (5.6 MHz) has p = 0.001 when compared against PCM (192 kHz/24 bit) in overall preference. This suggests that DSD version was statistically significantly preferred over the PCM version.&quot; These findings are questionable however, because &quot;the two formats were subject to different processing, most notably, different filtering of the low-frequency content.&quot;

Even though DSD-based SACD was more successful than its direct competitor, the PCM-based DVD-Audio, DSD met with relatively little success in the consumer market. Direct manipulation of recorded DSD data is difficult due to the limited availability of appropriate software. The advent of new high-resolution PCM standards, such as DXD, further restricted DSD&#x27;s market niche.

==DSD file formats==
There are several ways to store DSD encoded audio as files on a computer. One option is to use DSD native file formats used specifically for this purpose. Alternatively, DSD can be stored in general purpose audio formats officially adapted to support DSD storage. Finally, DSD audio can be embedded into PCM audio streams that do not have special DSD support. However, a special decoder is needed to recover the DSD stream from these PCM files.

===DSD Interchange File Format===
&quot;DSD Interchange File Format&quot; (DSDIFF) is a native DSD file format developed by Philips between 2000 and 2004 for storage of DSD recordings. The format supports DST compression of the payload as well as annotations used in Super Audio CD production. A single DSDIFF file may store an entire album as a single audio stream together with markers indicating the location of individual tracks for the album. Some parts of the audio content may be left out entirely from the resulting SACD. The embedded metadata format is intended for mastering engineers not consumers. For example, markers indicating the beginning of a new audio track have a text field for storing arbitrary text-based information. However, there is no requirement for the text to contain the title of the track. A de facto standard for including ID3 metadata in an unofficial ID3 chunk was later developed as consumers adopted the format for storing individual tracks of DSD audio. DSDIFF files typically use the codice_1 file suffix. No official media type has been registered for the DSDIFF file format. Freedesktop.org uses the unofficial media types codice_2.

===Wideband Single-bit Data===
&quot;Wideband Single-bit Data&quot; (WSD) is a native DSD file format developed by 1-bit Audio Consortium in 2002. The consortium was established by Waseda University, Sharp and Pioneer a year earlier. In 2012 the consortium published an updated 1.1 version of the specification. The WSD header has a field for storing an absolute timestamp in samples since midnight. The timestamp makes it possible to accurately know how much time passed between two recordings made consecutively on the same physical recording device. Korg portable recorders MR-1, MR-2, MR-1000 and MR-2000s support WSD alongside other DSD based formats.

===DSD Stream File===
&quot;DSD Stream File&quot; (DSF) is a native DSD file format developed by Sony around 2005. The format is intended for storing individual tracks of DSD audio and has native support for ID3 metadata inclusion. The format defines a &quot;format ID&quot; field that could presumably be used to indicate DST compression. However, the only identifier defined in the spec is number 0 indicating &quot;DSD raw&quot;. Files containing DSF data would typically use thecodice_3 file suffix. No official media type has been registered for the DSF file format. Freedesktop.org uses the unofficial media types codice_4.

===DSD compatible file formats===
DSD-compatible file formats support storing DSD-encoded audio in addition to audio encoded as PCM.

WavPack is a generic audio storage format supporting various different forms of audio. Compressed DSD audio is also supported by the format. The DSD support was initially introduced with the release of WavPack software suite version 5 in December 2016. Files containing WavPack data would typically use thecodice_5 file suffix. No official media type has been registered for the WavPack file format. Freedesktop.org uses the unofficial media types codice_6. Since WavPack supports multiple formats, the suffix or mime type alone does not indicate the presence of DSD audio.

===DSD over PCM (DoP)===

In addition to actual DSD file formats, a format called &quot;DSD Audio over PCM Frames&quot; (DoP) is used for embedding DSD into PCM audio streams. DoP makes it possible to circumvent any PCM-only component in the playback chain that would prevent a DSD-capable DAC from receiving the raw DSD data required for native DSD playback. While DoP is intended to be a wire protocol used for communication between music player application and a DAC, there exists tools that can embed DoP-encoded DSD into FLAC files enabling users to use a non-DSD capable player for DSD playback with their DoP-capable DAC. A DoP stream is designed to sound like low-volume noise when played back by a PCM-only DAC, while a DoP-capable DAC will detect the presence of DSD data, extract it from the PCM and play it back as DSD.

<text>Fofō Iosefa Fiti Sunia (born March 13, 1937) was the first non-voting Delegate from American Samoa to the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life and career==
Fofō Iosefa Fiti Sunia was born March 13, 1937, in Fagasā. He attended the University of Hawaiʻi and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. Sunia was the administrative officer for the Samoan affairs-liaison functions for the Governor of American Samoa, and served as a translator and interpreter and an election commissioner from 1961 to 1966. He founded the &quot;Samoan News&quot; newspaper in 1964 and became director of tourism for the Government of American Samoa in 1966, serving until 1970. Sunia was elected a territorial Senator in 1970 and was a member of the legislature until 1978. He also formerly served as president and chairman of the American Samoan Development Corporation.

==Congress==
He was elected to Congress in 1980. He served from January 3, 1981 until his resignation on September 6, 1988, after he was indicted on federal charges of running a payroll padding scheme. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five to fifteen months in prison and to pay $65,000 in restitution.

===Political views===
As a Delegate to the U.S. Congress, Sunia opposed a Constitutional amendment which would have made English the official language of the United States. He argued that English already is the language of the U.S. and the law represented few if any changes to the status quo. He was quoted for saying: &quot;… the 35,000 American Samoans on the island use the Samoan language in government, in the court, in business and in all facets of daily living, but strive to improve their proficiency in English.&quot; He did not believe the proposed amendment would reward &quot;linguistic differences as an asset.&quot;

==After Congress==
He was released from prison after 11 months. His knowledge and experience outweighed his conviction and he was hired to work as a staff member for the American Samoa Fono. By 1993, he was the highest-ranking staffer. As of 2016, he is a resident of Pago Pago.

<text>Moses Kimball Armstrong (September 19, 1832 – January 11, 1906) was an American surveyor who served as a delegate from Dakota Territory to the United States House of Representatives.

==Life==
Armstrong was born in Milan, Erie County, Ohio. He attended the Huron Institute in Milan and Western Reserve College in Cleveland, Ohio, then moved to the Minnesota Territory in 1856. He was elected surveyor of Mower County, and was assigned to survey federal lands.

When Minnesota was admitted to the Union, Armstrong moved to Yankton, Dakota Territory, then a small Native American village. He was a member of the first Territorial House of Representatives in 1861, was reelected in 1862 and 1863, and served as speaker in 1863. He became editor of the &quot;Dakota Union&quot; newspaper in 1864, and was appointed clerk of the territorial Supreme Court in 1865. He was elected to the territorial council in 1866 and in 1867, and served as the council&#x27;s president.

In 1867, Armstrong acted as secretary of the Indian peace commission in Dakota Territory. Continuing as a surveyor, he established the great meridian and standard lines for United States surveys in southern Dakota and in the northern Red River Valley. He was again elected to the Territorial council in 1869. In 1870 he was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives; he was reelected in 1872, and served from March 4, 1871 to March 3, 1875.

Armstrong was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1874, and moved to St. James, Watonwan County, Minnesota, where he engaged in banking and in real estate.

He died at Albert Lea, Minnesota, and is buried in the Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

<doc id="309536" wikidata="Q7625984" url="?curid=309536" title="Strähle construction">
<text>Strähle&#x27;s construction is a geometric method for determining the lengths for a series of vibrating strings with uniform diameters and tensions to sound pitches in a specific rational tempered musical tuning. It was first published in the 1743 &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&quot; by Swedish master organ maker Daniel Stråhle (1700–1746). The Academy&#x27;s secretary Jacob Faggot appended a miscalculated set of pitches to the article, and these figures were reproduced by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg in &quot;Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur&quot; in 1776. Several German textbooks published about 1800 reported that the mistake was first identified by Christlieb Benedikt Funk in 1779, but the construction itself appears to have received little notice until the middle of the twentieth century when tuning theorist J. Murray Barbour presented it as a good method for approximating equal temperament and similar exponentials of small roots, and generalized its underlying mathematical principles.

It has become known as a device for building fretted musical instruments through articles by mathematicians Ian Stewart and Isaac Jacob Schoenberg, and is praised by them as a unique and remarkably elegant solution developed by an unschooled craftsman.

The name &quot;Strähle&quot; used in recent English language works appears to be due to a transcription error in Marpurg&#x27;s text, where the old-fashioned diacritic raised &quot;e&quot; was substituted for the raised ring.

==Background==
Daniel P. Stråhle was active as an organ builder in central Sweden in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. He had worked as a journeyman for the important Stockholm organ builder Johan Niclas Cahman and, in 1741, four years after Cahman&#x27;s death, Stråhle was granted his privilege for organ making. According to the system in force in Sweden at the time a privilege, a granted monopoly which was held by only a few of the most established makers of each type of musical instruments, gave him the legal right to build and repair organs, as well as to train and examine workers, and it also served as a guarantee of the quality of the work and education of the maker. An organ by him from 1743 is preserved in its original condition at the chapel at Strömsholm Palace; he is also known to have made clavichords, and a notable example with an unusual string scale and construction signed by him and dated 1738 is owned by the Stockholm Music Museum. His apprentices included his nephew Petter Stråhle and Jonas Gren, partners in the famous Stockholm organ builders Gren &amp; Stråhle, and according to Abraham Abrahamsson Hülphers in his book &quot;Historisk Afhandling om Musik och Instrumenter&quot; published in 1773, Stråhle himself had studied mechanics (which has been assumed to have included mathematics) with Swedish Academy of Science founding member Christopher Polhem. He died in 1746 at Lövstabruk in northern Uppland.

Stråhle published his construction as a &quot;new invention, to determine the &quot;Temperament&quot; in tuning, for the pitches of the clavichord and similar instruments&quot; in an article that appeared in the fourth volume of the proceedings of the newly formed Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which included articles by prominent scholars and Academy members Polhem, Carl Linnaeus, Carl Fredrik Mennander, Augustin Ehrensvärd, and Samuel Klingenstierna. According to organologist Eva Helenius musical tuning was a subject of intense debate in the Academy during the 1740s, and though Stråhle himself was not a member his was the third article on practical musical topics published by the Academy—the first two were by amateur musical instrument maker, minister, and Academy member Nils Brelin which related inventions applicable to harpsichords and clavichords.

Stråhle wrote in his article that he had developed the method with &quot;some thought and a great number of attempts&quot; for the purpose of creating a gauge for the lengths of the strings in the temperament which he described as that which made the tempering (&quot;sväfningar&quot;) mildest for the ear, as well comprising as the most useful and even arrangement of the pitches. His instructions produce an irregular tuning with a range of tempered intervals similar to better known tunings published during the same period, but he provided no further comments or description about the tuning itself; today it is generally considered to be an approximation of equal temperament. He also did not elaborate upon any advantages of his construction, which can produce accurate and repeatable results without calculations or measurement with only a straightedge and dividers; he described the construction in only five steps, and it is less iterative than arithmetic methods described by Dom Bédos de Celles method for determining organ pipe lengths in just intonation or Vincenzo Galilei for determining string fret positions in approximate equal temperament, and geometrical methods such as those described by Gioseffo Zarlino and Marin Mersenne—all of which are much better known than Stråhle&#x27;s. Stråhle concluded by stating that he had applied the system to a clavichord, although the tuning as well as the method of determining a set of sounding lengths can be used for many other musical instruments, but there is little evidence showing whether it was put into more widespread practice other than the two examples described in the article, and whose whereabouts today are unknown.

==Construction==
Stråhle instructed first to draw a line segment &quot;QR&quot; of a convenient length divided in twelve equal parts, with points labeled I through XIII. &quot;QR&quot; is then used as the base of an isosceles triangle with sides &quot;OQ&quot; and &quot;OR&quot; twice as long as &quot;QR&quot;, and rays drawn from vertex &quot;O&quot; through each of the numbered points on the base. Finally a line is drawn from vertex &quot;R&quot; at an angle through a point &quot;P&quot; on the opposite leg of the triangle seven units from &quot;Q&quot; to a point &quot;M&quot;, located at twice the distance from &quot;R&quot; as &quot;P&quot;. The length of &quot;MR&quot; gives the length of the lowest sounding pitch, and the length of &quot;MP&quot; the highest of the string lengths generated by the construction, and the sounding lengths between them are determined by the distances from &quot;M&quot; to the intersections of &quot;MR&quot; with lines &quot;O I&quot; through &quot;O XII&quot;, at points labeled 1 through 12.

Stråhle wrote that he had named the line &quot;PR&quot; &quot;Linea Musica&quot;, which Helenius noted was a term Polhem had used in an undated but earlier manuscript now located at the Linköping Stifts- och Landsbibliotek and which is accompanied by notes from composer and geometer Harald Vallerius (1646–1716) and Stråhle&#x27;s former employer J. N. Cahman.

Stråhle also showed line segments parallel to &quot;MR&quot; through points &quot;NHS&quot;, &quot;LYT&quot;, and &quot;KZV&quot; in order to illustrate how once created the construction could be scaled to accommodate different starting pitches.

Stråhle stated at the conclusion of the article that he had implemented the string scale in the highest three octaves of a clavichord, although it is unclear whether this section would have been strung all with the same gauge wire under equal tension like the monochord which he wrote it resembled, and whose construction he described in more detail. He only described an indirect method of setting its tuning, however, requiring that he first establish reference pitches by transferring the corresponding string lengths to the movable bridges on a keyed thirteen string monochord whose open strings had been previously tuned in unison.

==Faggot&#x27;s numerical representation==

The article following Stråhle&#x27;s was a mathematical treatment of it by Jacob Faggot (1699–1777), then secretary of the Academy of Sciences and future director of the Surveying Office, who in the same volume also contributed articles on a weight measure for lye and methods for calculating the volume of barrels. Faggot was one of the first members of the Academy, and had also been member of a special commission on weights and measures. He apparently was not a musician, though Helenius described he was interested in musical topics from a mathematical perspective and documented that he periodically came in contact with musical instrument makers through the Academy. Helenius also presented a theory that Faggot had a more active, if indirect and posthumous influence on the construction of musical instruments in Sweden, claiming that he may have suggested the long tenor strings used in two experimental instruments built by Johan Broman in 1756 which she proposed influenced the type of clavichord built in Sweden in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

In his analysis of Stråhle&#x27;s article Faggot outlined the trigonometric steps he had used to calculate the sounding lengths of the individual pitches, for the purpose of comparing the new tuning produced by Stråhle&#x27;s method, against a tuning with pure thirds, fourths and fifths (labeled &quot;N. 1&quot; in the table), and equal temperament, which he called only &quot;an older temperament and [which] is introduced in Mr. Mattheson&#x27;s &quot;Critica Musica&quot;&quot; (&quot;N. 2&quot;), He intended the resulting set of figures to show whether &quot;the tuning of the pitches, following the previously described invention, satisfies the ear with pleasant sounds and with better evenness, in the &quot;Musical&quot; pitches on a keyboard instrument, and therefore teaches understanding better can judge than the old and previously known manner of tuning, when the eye can see what the ear hears.&quot;

Both articles were reproduced in a German edition of the Academy&#x27;s proceedings published in 1751, and a table of Faggot&#x27;s calculated string lengths was subsequently included by Marpurg on his 1776 &quot;Versuch über die musikalische Temperatur&quot;, who wrote that he accepted their accuracy but that rather than accomplishing &quot;Strähle&quot;&#x27;s stated goal, the tuning represented an unequal temperament &quot;not even of the tolerable type.&quot;

The sounding lengths calculated by Faggot are substantially different from what would be produced according to Stråhle&#x27;s instructions, a fact which appears to have been first published by Christlieb Benedict Funk in &quot;Dissertatio de Sono et Tono&quot; in 1779, and the tuning he created includes intervals tuned outside of the range conventionally used in Western art music. Funk is credited the observation of this discrepancy in Gehler&#x27;s &quot;Physikalisches Wörterbuch&quot; in 1791, and Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Physikalisches Wörterbuch&quot; in 1804, and the error was pointed out by Ernst Chladni in &quot;Die Akustik&quot; in 1830. No similar comments appear to have been published in Sweden during the same period.

These works report Faggot&#x27;s mistake as the result of having used a value from the tangent instead of the sine column from the logarithmic tables. The error itself consisted of making the angle of &quot;RP&quot; about seven degrees too great, which caused the effective length of &quot;QP&quot; to increase to 8.605. This greatly exaggerated the errors of the temperament compared to the tunings he presented alongside it, although it is not clear whether Faggot observed these apparent defects as he made no further comments about Stråhle&#x27;s construction or temperament in the article.

==The tuning==
The tuning produced following Stråhle&#x27;s instructions is a rational temperament with a range of fifths from 696 to 704 cents, which is from about one cent flatter than a meantone fifth to two cents sharp of just 3:2; the range of major thirds is from 396 cents to 404 cents, or ten cents sharp of just 5/4 to three cents flat of Pythagorean 81/64. These intervals fall within what is considered to have been acceptable but there is no distribution of better thirds to more frequently used keys that characterize what are today the most popular of the tunings published in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which are known as &quot;well temperaments&quot;. The best fifth is pure in the key of F♯—or the pitch given by &quot;MB&quot;—which has a 398 cent third, and the best third is in the key E, which has a 697 cent fifth; the best combination of the two intervals is in the key of F and the worst combination is in the key of B♭.

==Barbour&#x27;s algebraic representation and geometric construction==
J. Murray Barbour brought new attention to Stråhle&#x27;s construction along with Faggot&#x27;s treatment of it in the 20th century. Introduced in the context of Marpurg, he included an overview of it alongside the more famous methods of determining string lengths in his 1951 book &quot;Tuning and Temperament&quot; where he characterized the tuning as an &quot;approximation for equal temperament&quot;. He also demonstrated how close Stråhle&#x27;s construction was to the best approximation the method could provide, which reduces the maximum errors in major thirds and fifths by about half a cent and is accomplished by substituting 7.028 for the length of &quot;QP&quot;.

Barbour presented a more complete analysis of the construction in &quot;A Geometrical Approximation to the Roots of Numbers&quot; published six years later in &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;. He reviewed Faggot&#x27;s error and its consequences, and then derived Stråhle&#x27;s construction algebraically using similar triangles. This takes the generalized form
:formula_1

Using the values from Stråhle&#x27;s instructions this becomes
:formula_2

Letting formula_3 so that formula_4 leads to a form of the first formula that is more useful for calculation
:formula_5

Barbour then described a generalized construction using the easily obtained mean proportional for the length of &quot;MB&quot; that avoids most of the specific angles and lengths required in the original. For musical applications it is simpler and its results are slightly more uniform than Stråhle&#x27;s, and it has the advantage of producing the desired string lengths without additional scaling.

He instructed to first draw the line &quot;MR&quot; corresponding to the larger of the two numbers with &quot;MP&quot; the smaller, and to construct their mean proportional at &quot;MB&quot;. The line that will carry the divisions is drawn from &quot;R&quot; at any acute angle to &quot;MR&quot;, and perpendicular to it a line is drawn through &quot;B&quot;, which intersects the line to be divided at &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;RA&quot; is extended to &quot;Q&quot; such that &quot;RA&quot;=&quot;AQ&quot;. A line is drawn from &quot;Q&quot; through &quot;P&quot;, intersecting the line through &quot;BA&quot; at &quot;O&quot;, and a line drawn from &quot;O&quot; to &quot;R&quot;. The construction is completed by dividing &quot;QR&quot; and drawing rays from &quot;O&quot; through each of the divisions.

Barbour concluded with a discussion of the pattern and magnitude of the errors produced by the generalized construction when used to approximate exponentials of different roots, stating that his method &quot;is simple and works exceedingly well for small numbers&quot;. For roots from 1 to 2 the error is less than 0.13%—about 2 cents when &quot;N&quot;=2— with maxima around &quot;m&quot;=0.21 and &quot;m&quot;=0.79. The error curve appears roughly sinusoidal and for this range of &quot;N&quot; can be approximated by about 99% by fitting the curve obtained for &quot;N&quot;=1, formula_6. The error increases rapidly for larger roots, for which Barbour considered the method inappropriate; the error curve resembles the form formula_7 with maxima moving closer to &quot;m&quot;= 0 and &quot;m&quot;=1 as &quot;N&quot; increases.

===Schoenberg&#x27;s refinements of Barbour&#x27;s methods===
The paper was published with two notes added by its referee, Isaac Jacob Schoenberg. He observed that the formula derived by Barbour was a fractional linear transformation and so called for a perspectivity, and that since three pairs of corresponding points on the two lines uniquely determined a projective correspondence Barbour&#x27;s condition that &quot;OA&quot; be perpendicular to &quot;QR&quot; was irrelevant. The omission of this step allows a more convenient selection of length for &quot;QR&quot;, and reduces the number of operations.

Schoenberg also noted that Barbour&#x27;s equation could be viewed as an interpolation of the exponential curve through the three points &quot;m&quot;=0, &quot;m&quot;=1/2, and &quot;m&quot;=1, which he expanded upon in a short paper titled &quot;On the Location of the Frets on the Guitar&quot; published in &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; in 1976. This article concluded with a brief discussion of Stråhle&#x27;s fortuitous use of formula_8 for the half-octave, which is one of the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of the formula_9, and the best rational approximation of it for the size of the denominator.

===Stewart and continued fractions===
The use of fractional approximations of formula_9 in Stråhle&#x27;s construction was expanded upon by Ian Stewart, who wrote about the construction in &quot;A Well Tempered Calculator&quot; in his 1992 book &quot;Another Fine Math You&#x27;ve Got Me Into...&quot; as well as &quot;Faggot&#x27;s Fretful Fiasco&quot; included in &quot;Music and Mathematics&quot; published in 2006. Stewart considered the construction from the standpoint of projective geometry, and derived the same formulas as Barbour by treating it from the start as a fractional linear function, of the form formula_11, and he pointed out that the approximation for formula_9 implicit in the construction is formula_13, which is the next lower convergent from the half octave it produces. This is the consequence of the function simplifying to formula_14 for &quot;m&quot;=0.5 where formula_15 is the generating approximation.

==Similar methods applied to musical instruments==
The geometric and arithmetic methods for dividing monochords as well as musical instrument fretboards compiled by Barbour were for the stated purpose of illustrating the different tunings each represents or implies, and Schoenberg&#x27;s and Stewart&#x27;s works retained similar focus and references. Three textbooks on piano building that are not included by them show similar constructions to Stråhle&#x27;s for designing new instruments but treat the tuning of their pitches independently; both constructions employ a non-perpendicular form as suggested by Schoenberg&#x27;s observation in Barbour&#x27;s &quot;A Geometrical approximation to the Roots of Numbers&quot;, and one achieves optimal results while the other demonstrates an application with a root other than 2.

===Kützing===
Carl Kützing, an organ and piano maker in Bern during the middle of the 19th century wrote in his first book on piano design, &quot;Theoretisch-praktisches Handbuch der Fortepiano-Baukunst&quot; from 1833, that he devised a simple method of determining the sounding lengths in an octave after reading of the different geometric constructions described in an issue of Marpurg&#x27;s &quot;Historisch-kritischen Beitragen zur Aufnahme der Musik&quot;; he stated that the divisions would be very accurate and that the construction could be used for fretting guitars.

Kützing introduced the construction following a description of a large sector to be made for the same purpose. He did not include either method in &quot;Das Wissenschaftliche der Fortepiano-Baukunst&quot; published eleven years later, where he calculated lengths using approximately 18:35 ratios between octave lengths and proposed a new method with a non-continuous curve adjusted for actual wire diameters in order to reduce tonal differences from jumps in tension.

Kützing instructed to extend a line segment &quot;bc&quot;—representing a known sounding length—at 45 degrees to the line ba, and from its octave at point &quot;d&quot; located midway between &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, to extend a line perpendicular to &quot;ba&quot; intersecting it at &quot;e&quot;, then to divide &quot;de&quot; into 12 equal parts. The point &quot;a&quot; on &quot;ab&quot; is located by transferring the lengths of &quot;de&quot;, &quot;db&quot;, from &quot;e&quot; away from &quot;b&quot;, and rays extended from &quot;a&quot; through the points dividing &quot;de&quot; and intersecting &quot;bc&quot; to locate the different endpoints of the string lengths from &quot;c&quot;.

This arrangement is equivalent to using the mean proportional to locate &quot;a&quot;.

A re-labeled diagram with instructions was included in a pamphlet printed by England&#x27;s largest piano manufacturers John Broadwood &amp; Sons to accompany their display at the 1862 International Exhibition in London, where they described it as &quot;a practical method of finding the lengths of Strings, for every note of the Octave on equal temperament; so that with wire of the same size the tension on each note shall be the same.&quot;

It was also reproduced, alongside a sector, by Giacomo Sievers, a Russian-born piano maker working in Naples, in his 1868 book &quot;Il Pianoforte&quot;, where he claimed it was the best practical method for determining sounding lengths of strings in a piano. Like Broadwood, Sievers did not describe its source or extent of its use, and did not explain any theory behind it. He also did not suggest it had any use beyond designing pianos.

===Wolfenden===
English piano maker Samuel Wolfenden presented a construction for determining all but the lowest sounding plain string lengths in a piano in &quot;A Treatise on the Art of Pianoforte Construction&quot; published in 1916; like Sievers, he did not explain whether this was an original procedure or one in common use, commenting only that it was &quot;a very practical method of determining string lengths, and in past years I used it altogether&quot;. He added that at the time of writing he found calculating the lengths directly &quot;somewhat easier&quot; and had preceded the description with a table of computed lengths for the top five octaves of a piano. He included frequencies in equal temperament, but only published aural tuning instructions in his 1927 supplement.

Wolfenden explicitly advocated equalizing the tension of the plain strings which he proposed to accomplish in the upper range by combining a 9:17 ratio between octave lengths with a uniform change in string diameters (achieving slightly more consistent results over the otherwise similar system published by Siegfried Hansing in 1888), in contrast to Sievers scale whose stringing schedule results in higher tension for the thicker, lower sounding pitches.

Like Sievers, Wolfenden constructed all of the sounding lengths on a single segment at 45 degrees from the base lines for the rays, starting with points located for each C in the range designed at 54, 102, 192.5, 364, and 688mm from the upper point. The four vertices for the rays are then located by the intersections of the horizontal base lines extended from the lower C in each octave with a second line angled from the upper starting point for the string line, however, which he specified should both be at 51.5 degrees to the base lines and that the base lines have a 35:13 ratio with the difference between the two octave lengths.

Wolfenden&#x27;s method approximates formula_16 with roughly 1.3775, and is equivalent to formula_17 in Barbour&#x27;s form. Compensating for its smaller octaves this produces 596 cent half octaves, an error of about 1mm at note F4 (f′) compared with his calculated figures.

<text>Granville Gaylord Bennett (October 9, 1833 – June 28, 1910) was an American lawyer who served as a justice of the Supreme Court for the Dakota Territory and as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives. He was the presiding judge at the trial of Jack McCall for the Aug. 2,1876 murder of Wild Bill Hickok in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. This trial was held in Yankton, the then headquarters of the Territory. Judge Bennett later was assigned to Lawrence county and moved his family there.

==Biography==
Granville was born near Bloomingburg in Fayette County, Ohio, his parents were: Peter Bennett (1793-1859) and Mary Bennett née Pinkerton (1794-1894). His family moved to Fulton County, Illinois in 1849, and then to Washington, Iowa in 1855. He attended Washington College, an academy in Washington, Iowa, and then studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1859, and practiced in Washington. In 1860, he married Mary Dawson. They were the parents of three children who survived to adulthood; daughters Estelline Rea Bennett (1868 – 1948), author of OLD DEADWOOD DAYS, and Helen Marie Bennett (1872 – 1962), an American journalist, businesswoman, and writer who organized the four women&#x27;s world&#x27;s fairs of the 1920s, and son The Right Reverend Granville Gaylord Bennett D.D. (1882 – 1975), the second Bishop of Duluth and the eighth Bishop of Rhode Island in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Another son, Robert Dawson Bennett (1878 – 1892) was killed in a hunting accident at age 14 outside of Deadwood, South Dakota.

During the American Civil War he served in the Union Army, first as an officer in the 19th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and later on the staff of Thomas J. McKean, commander of the Army of the Tennessee. Following the war, he was discharged as a first lieutenant and returned to Washington, Iowa. He served as a member of the Iowa House of Representatives (1865–1867) and Iowa State Senate (1867–1871).

Bennett moved to the Dakota Territory in the early 1870s. He was appointed an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Territory in 1875, and he served until 1878. In 1878, he was elected as the Territory&#x27;s Delegate to the U.S. Congress, and served as a Republican from March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1881. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1880.

After his term in Congress, Bennett returned to Deadwood, South Dakota, where he continued to practice law. In 1902, he was elected judge of the Lawrence County Court, and he served three terms. He died in Hot Springs, Fall River County, South Dakota. He was interred in Mount Moriah Cemetery, in Deadwood.

Bennett County, South Dakota is thought by some historians to be named in his honor, whereas others attribute the county name to John E. Bennett, and some claim it honors both men.

<text>Jonathan Trumbull Sr. (October 12, 1710August 17, 1785) was an American politician and statesman who served as Governor of Connecticut during the American Revolution. Trumbull and Nicholas Cooke of Rhode Island were the only men to serve as governor of both a British colony and an American state, and he was the only governor to take up the Patriot cause at the start of the Revolutionary War. Trumbull College at Yale University, the town of Trumbull, Connecticut, Trumbull County, Ohio (originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve), and Jonathan the Husky are all named for him.

Trumbull was the father of John Trumbull, the noted artist, and Jonathan Trumbull Jr., Governor of Connecticut and Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==

Trumbull was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, the son of Joseph Trumble (1678–1755) and his wife, Hannah Trumble (née Higley), the daughter of John Higley and Hannah Drake. The patriarch of the Trumble family was the immigrant John Trumble (1612–1687), from Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, who was Joseph&#x27;s grandfather. The original spelling of &quot;Trumble&quot; was later changed for an unknown reason.

Jonathan graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. in 1727; for three years after graduation, he studied theology under the Reverend Solomon Williams at Lebanon and was licensed to preach at Colchester, Connecticut; this became a Master of Arts degree.

==Career==
Trumbull became a merchant with his father in 1731, participating more fully in the business after the death of his brother at sea in 1732. From 1733 to 1740, he was a delegate to the general assembly, and, in 1739–1740, was Speaker of the House. He was appointed lieutenant colonel in Connecticut&#x27;s militia in 1739, and was colonel of the 12th Connecticut Regiment during the French and Indian War.

He served as deputy governor of the Colony of Connecticut from 1766 to 1769, and, on the death of Governor William Pitkin, became Governor of Connecticut in 1769, serving in that capacity until 1784, through Connecticut&#x27;s transition from a colony to a U.S. state.

===Revolutionary War===
On May 13, 1774, British General Thomas Gage arrived in Boston, a city with a history of violent protests against British policies. Given the problems he was inheriting from Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, within a week of arriving Gage contacted Trumbull and expressed a &quot;readiness to cooperate&quot; with him &quot;for the good of his Majesty&#x27;s service.&quot; When Gage sent Trumbull a request for assistance after the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, Trumbull refused and made clear his choice to side with the Patriots. He replied that Gage&#x27;s troops would &quot;disgrace even barbarians&quot;, and he accused Gage of &quot;a most unprovoked attack upon the lives and the property of his Majesty&#x27;s subjects.&quot;

On July 6, 1775, along with other officers, Trumbull commissioned Nathan Hale as a first lieutenant in the newly raised Seventh Regiment of the Continental Army. Hale was later executed by the British for espionage.

Trumbull was a friend and advisor of General George Washington throughout the Revolutionary period, dedicating the resources of Connecticut to the fight for independence. Washington declared him &quot;the first of the patriots.&quot; When Washington was desperate for men or food during the war, he could turn to &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot;. Trumbull also served as the Continental Army&#x27;s Paymaster General (Northern Department) in the spring of 1778, until the untimely death of his mother forced him to resign his post. As part of his resignation, he requested that the remainder of his back pay be distributed to the soldiers of the Northern Department.

===Post-war===
Trumbull was one of only two colonial governors to continue in office after independence (the other was Rhode Island&#x27;s Nicholas Cooke, who assumed office early in the war). Governor Trumbull was elected as an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati in 1784. In 1782, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received an honorary LL.D. from Yale University in 1775 and from the University of Edinburgh in 1787.

==Personal life==

In 1736, one year prior to his marriage, Jonathan Trumbull Sr. purchased Flora, a &#x27;mulato girl and slave for life&#x27;, from Eliphalet Adams of New London.

On December 9, 1735, he married Faith Robinson (1718–1780), daughter of Reverend John Robinson. They were the parents of six children, including:
*Joseph Trumbull (1737–1778), first commissary general of the Continental Army and an early member of the Board of War.
*Jonathan Trumbull Jr. (1740–1809), aide-de-camp to General George Washington from 1781 to the end of the war, Speaker of the House from 1791 to 1793, and Governor of Connecticut from 1798 to 1809.
*Faith Trumbull (1743–1775), who married General Jedidiah Huntington.
*Mary Trumbull (1745–1831), who married William Williams, signer of the Declaration of Independence.
*David Trumbull (1751–1822), commissary of the Colony of Connecticut and father of Joseph Trumbull, the 35th Governor of Connecticut.
*John Trumbull (1756–1843), &quot;Painter of the American Revolution&quot; and aide-de-camp to General Washington for 19 days in 1775.

Trumbull died in Lebanon, Connecticut, and is buried at the Old Cemetery there. His home in Lebanon, the Jonathan Trumbull House, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.

==In historical fiction==
*In &quot;A Little Maid of Old Connecticut&quot; by Alice Turner Curtis, the main character, a little girl named Ellie Barlow, aided by a friend, delivers a secret message to Trumbull during his years as governor, after which he seeks her out, and helps her friend&#x27;s father get a much-needed job. The story begins in the year 1777.

<text>Harrisburg International Airport is a public airport in Middletown, Pennsylvania, United States, nine miles (15 km) southeast of Harrisburg. It is owned by the Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority.

The airport code MDT refers to Middletown, the town in which the airport is located. Planes landing at MDT from the south are often routed near Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station a few miles from the airport. The airport, frequently referred to as HIA, is the primary commercial airport in South Central Pennsylvania and is the third-busiest airport in Pennsylvania for passenger enplanements and cargo shipments behind Philadelphia International Airport and Pittsburgh International Airport.

==History==
===19th century===

Harrisburg International Airport has been serving south-central Pennsylvania since the late 19th century.. Beginning in 1898, the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army was stationed here. This was followed by the first military airplanes landing in 1918 at what had become Olmsted Field of the fledgling U.S. Army Air Service.

===20th century===
The Middletown Air Depot, later renamed Middletown Air Materiel Area at Olmsted, provided logistical and maintenance support of military aircraft until it closed in 1969. In 1968, airline flights moved from Capital City Airport to the former U.S. Air Force base, renamed as Olmsted State Airport. The airport was renamed Harrisburg International Airport in 1973. Architect William Pereira designed the new terminals, completed in 1973.
From April 1969 through the completion of its May 1971 acquisition by Universal Airlines, American Flyers Airline, a supplemental air carrier, was based at Olmsted State Airport. American Flyers flew charter flights, including to Europe.

Prior to deregulation, Harrisburg was served by Allegheny Airlines with flights to several Northeast destinations, Trans World Airlines with flights to Chicago, and Altair Airlines with commuter flights within Pennsylvania.

In 1998, the Commonwealth transferred ownership to the Susquehanna Area Regional Airport Authority (SARAA). The Authority board consists of community volunteers appointed to staggered, five-year terms by the elected officials from Cumberland, Dauphin, and York counties, the cities of Harrisburg and York, and Fairview and Lower Swatara townships.

===21st century===
A new 360,000 square-foot terminal was completed in 2004. It cost $120 million and was designed by the Sheward Partnership.

As of 2008, about 1,400 people work in the system of Harrisburg International Airport.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Harrisburg International Airport covers at an elevation of 310 feet (94 m) above mean sea level. It has one asphalt runway, 13/31, .

Runway 13 has a CAT III approach allowing operations down to RVR (Runway Visual Range). The airport has a Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) that allows aircraft and vehicle ground movements during reduced visibility (below RVR down to RVR).

The airfield also boasts a 140-foot control tower and associated approach control staffed and operated by FAA air traffic controllers.

In the year ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 48,788 aircraft operations, an average of 134 per day: 26% air taxi, 29% general aviation, 27% scheduled commercial and 18% military. 29 aircraft were then based at this airport: 6 single-engine, 4 multi-engine, 11 jet, and 8 military.

The terminal has 12 gates and is a pier finger layout near the middle of the airfield, almost parallel to the runway. Delta Air Lines uses A1 and A3. United Airlines uses B1 and B3. Allegiant Air uses B6. American Airlines uses B2, and C1–C3. Gate A2, B4, and B5 are currently unused.

===Ground transportation===
Built in 2004, and attached to the new terminal building via a climate-controlled sky bridge, the Multi-Modal Transportation Facility (MMTF) is a four-story facility that handles all ground transportation. The top three levels have 2,504 parking places for Short-Term Hourly, Daily, and Long-Term public parking. The first level accommodates all limos, taxis, hotel shuttles, public and charter buses, plus the rental car ready/return lot.

In the first floor lobby area are six rental car counters, restrooms, flight and bus information displays, and a seating area. On the second floor of the lobby area, climate-controlled moving sidewalks connect to the aerial walkway to the terminal.

Route 7 of the Capital Area Transit System runs to downtown Harrisburg and surrounding communities. The Middletown Amtrak Station, about east of the terminal, has Amtrak service via the Keystone Corridor. There had been a proposal to construct a new rail terminal adjacent to the MMTF, but the final location chosen for the new station is about east, in Middletown.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger Destinations===

===Cargo===
Harrisburg International Airport has freight-forwarding capability. The airport is next to I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike), I-83, and I-81, allowing fast transfer of goods. Three major air cargo shippers maintain air service at the east end of the airport in an apron area next to the runway:

===Annual traffic===
==Pennsylvania Air National Guard use==
Despite the closure of Olmsted AFB in 1969, the US Air Force continues an Air National Guard presence at Harrisburg in the form of Harrisburg Air National Guard Station and the Pennsylvania Air National Guard&#x27;s 193rd Special Operations Wing (193 SOW), an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC)-gained unit flying the EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft. The 193 SOW is the sole operator of this critical aircraft asset for the entire US Air Force and in 2001 transitioned from the EC-130E to the new EC-130J variant. The wing has seen extensive federal service in recent years in support of Operations Just Cause, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
The Air Force Presidential Airlift Squadron uses MDT as a practice airport for a number of reasons: its runway is long enough for a loaded 747, relatively low traffic, close proximity to Andrews Air Force Base, and the presence of the Air National Guard at MDT.

<text>Children of the Dog Star is a science fiction television program for children produced in New Zealand in 1984. It consists of six episodes of 24-minutes each. It was written by Ken Catran and directed by Chris Bailey, with the novelisation written by Marie Stuttard.

==Plot synopsis==
On holiday at her uncle&#x27;s farm in New Zealand, Gretchen befriends Ronny, a Māori boy with a troubled city past, and Bevis, the birdwatching son of a loathed developer. Tension is already high as the developer wants to buy and drain a local swamp for a housing estate, but Ronny&#x27;s uncle is the guardian of a traditional Māori tapu (taboo/curse) upon the swamp. The swamp must not be touched—something sleeps there that must not be awakened.

In the story, twelve-year-old Gretchen has a passion for science and a talent for all things mechanical, which is why the strange old brass &quot;weathervane&quot; (referred to as the &quot;daisy rod&quot;) on her uncle&#x27;s farm fascinates her. But the brass daisy rod has a complex and terrifying significance, and Gretchen and her new friend Ronny discover its links with the far distant Sirius, the Dog Star.

Gradually, the children discover the pieces of an ancient alien space probe named &quot;Kolob&quot;. During the series they assemble the missing parts and strange things start to happen. The probe was one of three sent to earth to educate the human race in science. In the end a communication link is set up with the star Sirius B, from where the probe came, and the aliens tell them they (the aliens) should not have interfered.

<text>The Territory of Dakota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until November 2, 1889, when the final extent of the reduced territory was split and admitted to the Union as the states of North and South Dakota.

==History==
The Dakota Territory consisted of the northernmost part of the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, as well as the southernmost part of Rupert&#x27;s Land, which was acquired in 1818 when the boundary was changed to the 49th parallel. The name refers to the Dakota branch of the Sioux tribes which occupied the area at the time. Most of Dakota Territory was formerly part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories.

When Minnesota became a state in 1858, the leftover area between the Missouri River and Minnesota&#x27;s western boundary fell unorganized. When the Yankton Treaty was signed later that year, ceding much of what had been Sioux Indian land to the U.S. Government, early settlers formed a provisional government and unsuccessfully lobbied for United States territory status. Wilmot Wood Brookings was the provisional governor. The cities of Wilmot and Brookings as well as Brookings County are named for him.
Three years later, President-elect Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s cousin-in-law John Blair Smith Todd personally lobbied for territory status, and the U.S. Congress formally created Dakota Territory. It became an organized territory on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, Dakota Territory included much of present-day Montana and Wyoming as well as all of present-day North Dakota and South Dakota and a small portion of present-day Nebraska. President Lincoln appointed Dakota Territory&#x27;s first governor, William Jayne, who was Lincoln&#x27;s old friend and neighbor from Springfield, Illinois.

A small patch of land known as &quot;Lost Dakota&quot; existed as a remote exclave of Dakota Territory until it became part of Gallatin County, Montana Territory, in 1873.

All land north of the Keya Paha River (which includes most of Boyd County, Nebraska, and a smaller portion of neighboring Keya Paha County) was originally part of Dakota Territory, but was transferred to Nebraska in 1882.

==American Civil War==
Dakota Territory was not directly involved in the American Civil War but did raise some troops to defend the settlements following the Dakota War of 1862 which triggered hostilities with the Sioux tribes of Dakota Territory. The Department of the Northwest sent expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863, 1864 and 1865. It also established forts in Dakota Territory to protect the frontier settlements of the Territory, Iowa and Minnesota and the traffic along the Missouri River.

==Before statehood==
Following the Civil War, hostilities continued with the Sioux until the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. By 1868, creation of new territories reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of the Dakotas. Territorial counties were defined in 1872, including Bottineau County, Cass County and others.

During the existence of the organized territory, the population first increased very slowly and then very rapidly with the &quot;Dakota Boom&quot; from 1870 to 1880. Because the Sioux were considered very hostile and a threat to early settlers, the white population grew slowly. Gradually, the settlers&#x27; population grew and the Sioux were not considered as severe a threat.

The population increase can largely be attributed to the growth of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Settlers who came to the Dakota Territory were from other western territories as well as many from northern and western Europe. These included large numbers of Norwegians, Germans, Swedes, and Canadians.
Commerce was originally organized around the fur trade. Furs were carried by steamboat along the rivers to the settlements. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and attracted more settlers, setting off the last Sioux War. The population surge increased the demand for meat spurring expanded cattle ranching on the territory&#x27;s vast open ranges. With the advent of the railroad agriculture intensified: wheat became the territory&#x27;s main cash crop. Economic hardship hit the territory in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.

There are two conflicting narratives on why the Dakota Territory was divided and given statehood. One narrative suggests that it was due to regionalist tensions while the other suggests that it was a political play by Gilded Age Republicans.

=== Regionalist Narrative ===
Regionalist tensions between the northern and the southern parts of the territory were present since the beginning. The southern part was always more populated, in the 1880 Census, the southern part had a population of 98,268, two and a half times the northern part&#x27;s 36,909. The southern part also considered the north to be somewhat disreputable, &quot;too much controlled by the wild folks, cattle ranchers, fur traders” and too frequently the site of conflict with the indigenous population. The railroad also connected the northern and southern parts to different hubs – the northern part, via Fargo and Bismarck became closer tied to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, while the southern part became closer tied to Sioux City and from there to Omaha.

Politically, territorial legislators were appointed by the federal government, and tended to remain in the region only while they served their terms. The larger population of the southern region began to resent them, while the northerners tended to emphasize that it was cheaper to be a territory, with the federal government funding a wide range of state functions.

The territorial governor Nehemiah G. Ordway moved the territorial capital from Yankton to Bismarck in 1883. The capital grab, which moved the capital away from the majority of the population fueled more resentment from the south.

As the southern part which was anxious for statehood so they could have their own capital, had already crossed the 60,000 population necessary for statehood, and so, in September,1883, they held a convention, where they drafted a state constitution and submitted it to the voters. It was approved by the electors and submitted to Congress. A bill providing for statehood of the Dakota Territory south of the 46th parallel of latitude was passed by the Senate in December 1884, but failed to pass the House. A second constitutional convention for South Dakota was held in September 1885, framing a new constitution and submitted it to the vote of the people, who ratified it with an overwhelming vote.

Conventions favoring division of Dakota into two states were also held in the northern section, one in 1887 at Fargo, and another in 1888, at Jamestown. Both adopted provisions memorializing Congress to divide the territory and admit both North and South Dakota as states. Various bills were introduced in Congress on the matter; one in 1885 to admit South Dakota as a state, and organize the northern half as Lincoln Territory. Another bill introduced in 1886, proposed to admit the entire Territory as a single state.  Still another provided for all of the Territory east of the Missouri River to become a single state, the balance to be organized as Lincoln or North Dakota Territory. Other bills were introduced in 1887 and 1888, but failed to pass. The Territorial Legislature of 1887 submitted the question of division to a popular vote at the general election of November 1887. When full returns of this election finally came in on January 10, 1888, 37,784 favored division and 32,913 were opposed.

=== Political Play Narrative ===
In 1889, Republican Benjamin Harrison became president of the United States and favoured statehood for Dakota. In order to become a state, a territory was required to have a population of at least 60,000. In 1889, southern Dakota had a population of over 340,000, and northern Dakota had a population of over 150,000 so Congress is said to have decided that it was finally time to grant statehood. But in reality, the Republican Party, which wanted more power in the U.S. Senate, put on pressure to divide Dakota into two states. With two senators from each state, the Republicans would gain four more senate seats in Congress. After defeating Democratic President Grover Cleveland in the 1888 election, they celebrated by splitting the Republican-dominated Dakota into two territories and admitting &quot;both&quot; of them as states. Today, there are still two Dakotas because Gilded Age Republicans wanted four senators instead of just two. In their eagerness to admit both Dakotas, congressmen also ignored that much of the land in the anticipated state of South Dakota belonged to the Sioux. 

Perhaps, the capital change from Yankton to Bismarck can also be explained by the fact that Yankton was located in southern South Dakota on the territory&#x27;s border with Nebraska while Bismarck, whose community had recently grown due to the arrival of the Transcontinental railway, had a relatively better central location near the Black Hills of South Dakota where recent gold discovery was a great impetus for growth and led it to becoming a freight-shipping centre on the &quot;Custer Route&quot; from the Black Hills. 

Yankton&#x27;s status as an important port was literally crushed on March 27, 1881, when an ice dam on the Missouri River burst, sending flood waters and giant blocks of ice flowing towards the town. The resulting flood waters continued to accumulate behind the debris, and by March 29, the town&#x27;s riverfront and downtown were covered in water, ice and rock, destroying or stranding several riverboats that were moored there. As a result of this flood, and the expansion of railroads as a preferred method of shipping goods, Yankton&#x27;s river boat traffic was reduced, and the city&#x27;s role as a prominent stopping point on the way west dwindled over the next several years.

It was also not especially unusual for the party that controls Congress to admit states for political reasons. In 1864, Republican President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation admitting Nevada, a barely populated desert state with a few thousand residents, into the union as a state. The few people who did live there were overwhelmingly Republican. A dozen years later, President Ulysses Grant, also a Republican, signed legislation admitting Republican-dominated Colorado as a state even though according to the then latest census, Colorado had fewer than 40,000 residents. Republicans also successfully blocked New Mexico from becoming a state until 1912 while Cleveland’s Democrats had hoped to admit New Mexico as it would have favored them.

=== Admission ===
The admission of new western states was a party political battleground, with each party looking at how the proposed new states were likely to vote. At the beginning of 1888, the Democrats under president Grover Cleveland proposed that the four territories of Montana, New Mexico, Dakota and Washington should be admitted together. The first two were expected to vote Democratic and the latter two were expected to vote Republican so this was seen as a compromise acceptable to both parties. However, the Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate later that year. To head off the possibility that Congress might only admit Republican territories to statehood, the Democrats agreed to a less favorable deal in which Dakota was divided in two and New Mexico was left out altogether. Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1889, and the territories could become states nine months after that.

=== Sioux Dispute ===
There had been previous attempts to open up the territory, but these had foundered because the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) required that 75 percent of Sioux adult males on the reservation had to agree to any treaty change. Most recently, a commission headed by Richard Henry Pratt in 1888 had completely failed to get the necessary signatures in the face of opposition from Sioux leaders and even government worker Elaine Goodale, later Superintendent of Indian Education for the Dakotas. The government believed that the Dawes Act (1887), which attempted to move the Indians from hunting to farming, in theory, meant that they needed less land (but in reality was an economic disaster for them) and that at least half was available for sale. Congress approved an offer of for reservation land (a figure they had previously rejected as outrageously high) and $25,000 to induce the Indians to sign.

A new commission was appointed in April 1889 that included veteran Indian fighter general George Crook. Crook pulled out all the stops to get the Indians to sign, using many underhand tactics. He threatened them that if they did not sign, the land would be taken anyway and they would get nothing. This would not have been seen as an idle threat; the treaty had been ignored in the past when the Black Hills were taken from the Sioux. Crook ignored leaders like Sitting Bull and Red Cloud who opposed the sale and kept them out of the negotiations, preferring instead to deal with moderate leaders like American Horse. American Horse, however, claimed immediately afterwards that he had been tricked into signing. Crook made many personal promises (such as on reservation rations) which he had no authority to make, or ability to keep. He claimed afterwards that he had only agreed to report the concerns back to Washington. Crook lied about how many signatures he already had, giving the impression that the signature he was currently asking for would make no difference. He said that those who did not sign would not get a share of the money for the land. Crook even allowed white men who had married Sioux to sign, a dubious action given that the blood quantum laws only counted full-blood Indians as members of the tribe. By August 6, 1889, Crook had the requisite number of signatures, half the reservation land was sold, and the remainder divided among six smaller reservations.

==Statehood==

On February 22, 1889, outgoing President Cleveland signed an omnibus bill that divided the Territory of Dakota in half. North Dakota and South Dakota became states simultaneously on November 2, 1889. President Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded. The bill also enabled the people in the new Territories of North Dakota and South Dakota, as well as the older territories of Montana and Washington, to write state constitutions and elect state governments. The four new states would be admitted into the Union in nine months. This plan cut Democratic New Mexico out of statehood and split Republican Dakota Territory into two new Republican states. Rather than two new Republican states and two new Democratic states that Congress had considered the previous year, the omnibus bill created three new Republican states and one new Democratic state that Republicans thought they would capture.

<text>The governor of Dakota Territory was the head of government of Dakota Territory, a territory of the United States from March 2, 1861, to November 2, 1889, when it was split into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota. 

== Governors ==

Eleven people were appointed governor of Dakota Territory by the President of the United States during its existence, though one, John F. Potter, declined the post.

A provisional government formed in January 1859 and elected Wilmot Brookings as territorial governor, but the federal government refused to acknowledge the provisional government as official.

<text>Walter Atwood Burleigh (October 25, 1820 – March 7, 1896) was an American physician, lawyer, and pioneer. He represented the Dakota Territory as a non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives.

==Biography==
Walter was born in Waterville, Maine on October 25, 1820. He served in the Aroostook War in 1839, studied medicine in Burlington, Vermont and Manhattan, New York City, and began his practice in Richmond, Maine. In 1852 he moved to Kittanning, Pennsylvania. Then, around 1861, he became an Indian agent at Greenwood, Dakota Territory (in what is now the Yankton Sioux Reservation in Charles Mix County, South Dakota.

Some Yankton Sioux Indians complained bitterly of mistreatment by Burleigh. The testimony of Strike the Ree and Medicine Cow to a Special Joint Committee on the Condition of the Indian Tribes in 1865 suggests that Burleigh was self-serving and corrupt in his dealings with the Indians.

Burleigh was elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1865 – March 3, 1869. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1868.

On March 31, 1868, Burleigh testified in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, having been called as a witness by the prosecution.

Burleigh was a member of the Dakota Territorial council in 1877, then worked as a contractor and in farming, and moved to Miles City, Montana 1879, where he practiced law.

He served as a member of the special session of the Montana Territorial council in 1887 and as a delegate to the convention that framed the constitution of Montana in 1889. He was a member of the first State House of Representatives, and served as prosecuting attorney of Custer County.

Burleigh returned to South Dakota in 1893, resumed the practice of law, and served in the South Dakota State Senate. He died in Yankton, Yankton County, South Dakota, and is buried in the Yankton Cemetery. Burleigh County, North Dakota is named for him.

<text>Oscar Sherman Gifford (October 20, 1842 – January 16, 1913) was an American lawyer of Canton, South Dakota. He served six years in the United States House of Representatives, first as the non-voting delegate from the Dakota Territory, then as a full member of the House from South Dakota.

Oscar was born in Watertown, Jefferson County, New York, and moved with his parents to Wisconsin, settling in Rock County and then in Brown County, Illinois. He served as a private in the Union during the American Civil War.

After the war Gifford studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1871, beginning his practice in Canton, Dakota Territory (now South Dakota). He was district attorney for Lincoln County, mayor of Canton, and a member of the State constitutional convention of South Dakota which convened at Sioux Falls on September 7, 1883. He was a Republican, and was twice elected as the Territorial delegate to Congress, and served from March 4, 1885 to March 3, 1889.

Upon the admission of South Dakota as a state, it was allocated two seats in the U.S. House. Candidates ran at-large for Seat A or Seat B. Gifford was the first Congressman elected to Seat B, and served from November 2, 1889, to March 3, 1891. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1890, and resumed the practice of law in Canton. He was superintendent of the Canton Asylum for Insane Indians until his resignation in 1908. He continued to live in Canton, where he died on January 16, 1913. He was interred in Forest Hill Cemetery in Canton.

<text>Allariz is a town and municipality () in the province of Ourense, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It occupies the center of the western half of the province, connecting with the towns (&quot;concellos&quot;) of Taboadela, Paderne, Sandiás, Vilar de Santos, Rairiz de Veiga, Xunqueira de Ambía, A Merca and A Bola. The area of the municipality is 85,3 km² and there are 6.188 inhabitants in 16 parishes.

The hydrographic system is made up of the River Arnoia, which crosses the municipality from east to west. The surrounding hills are covered with pine and native oak. The valley itself is very fertile and the river banks are lined with trees.
The climate can be defined as inland Atlantic with continental influences. Summers are warm with highs averaging 25 °C, while winter highs average 12 °C.

Allariz is a town which relies on tourism and proximity to the provincial capital of Ourense, fifteen kilometers away. Because of its picturesque location on the banks of the Arnoia, it is a sought-after location for summer houses. The main highway crossing the south of Galicia, the &quot;Autovia das Rias Baixas&quot;, crosses the Arnoia on one of the longest highway bridges in Spain and provides easy access to the town.

==History==

Local life had its origin in the &quot;castro&quot; which dominates the Arnoia. Little is known about development of the town until the barbarian invasions of the seventh century. Legends attribute its foundation to the Suevian chieftain Alaric. All that is known is that its first name was &quot;Villa Alaricii&quot;.

In the twelfth century a royal fortress of the Galaico-Leonese dynasty was built on the hill overlooking the modern town. Between the years 1132 and 1140 it was the key in the wars against the expansion of Portugal, and thanks to its defense the south of Galicia was not absorbed into Portugal. Alfonso VII of Castile gave it the title of town or &quot;foro&quot;. Everything indicates that the Castle of Allariz was always a residence of the royal families and place of education for the princes.

At the end of the fourteenth century the opposition between the royal power, represented by Allariz, and the episcopal power of Ourense increased. In 1446 Juan II of Castile gave the town to the Count of Benavente, who wanted it for his designs of dominating Galicia. In 1471 the Irmandiños de Galicia besieged the castle, helped by the people in the town. This siege lasted nine months.
Later powerful families built their houses and palaces. New churches were built and Allariz lived an era of prosperity, as it had before under royal protection.

The French invasion during the Peninsular War destroyed many churches and caused great loss in the town, but the army of Soult, defeated in Porto, found refuge in the town.
The period of &quot;desamortization&quot; (19th century) ruined the Monastery and was the cause of the destruction of the castle and the town walls, whose stones were used to build the road to Ourense.
Allariz had a Jewish community ever since the 11th century. Upon a complaint of the prior of the monastery of Allariz in 1289, the Jewish congregation of the town was notified that they were no longer permitted to live outside the Jewish quarter. Christians were also prohibited from living in that quarter.

==Politics==

==Tourist sites==

Allariz constitutes one of the most important historical-artistic sites of Galicia. In the town there are admirable examples of military, religious, and civil elements. Today it preserves its medieval character, reflected in its monuments and in its cobblestone streets.

We must mention the chapel of San Bieito and the &quot;Real Mosteiro de Santa Clara&quot;, with one of the largest cloisters in Spain. A fundamental example of Galego romanesque architecture is the parish church of Santiago and the bridge of Vilanova.

The highlight of the town is doubtlessly the area around the Arnoia River, which has been converted into a parkland with paths following the riverbanks under ancient oak trees. Abandoned leather factories have been restored and converted into restaurants and a museum.

==&quot;Festa do Boi&quot; (Festival of the Ox)==

According to this legend, with heavy antisemitic overtones, the festival began in the Middle Ages. The Jewish community tried to ruin the procession of Corpus Christi when it was crossing their street on the way to the Church of Santo Estevo. Supposedly the Jews insulted the people, made fun of the religious symbols and provoked the priests and monks.
This is when Xan de Arzúa appeared, a man of religious convictions, who decided to appear one year riding a bull pulled by his servants who carried sacks with ants and ashes to throw at the faces of the disrespectful Jews.

In memory of this happening, every year during the festival of Corpus Christi, garlanded oxen run through the streets of the town. Flour with ants is also thrown at bystanders to remember the legendary Xan de Arzúa. A cloth figure representing Xan is carried in procession to the town hall where it is hung on the balcony. The original antisemitic background to the festival has been forgotten by most modern viewers.

<text>A is a traditionally made Japanese knife () that was worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan. The dates to the Heian period, when it was mainly used as a weapon but evolved in design over the years to become more ornate. were used in traditional martial arts () and in the &quot;seppuku&quot; suicide ritual. The term has seen a resurgence in the West since the 1980s as referring to a point style of modern tactical knives, designed for piercing or stabbing, though the style is not present on any traditional tantō.

A Tanto knife may refer to an American style of blade based of the Japanese , usually with a squared rather than curved tip.

==Description==
The is a single or double edged dagger with a length between (1 Japanese ). The was designed primarily as a stabbing weapon, but the edge can be used for slashing as well.
 are generally forged in the style (without a ridgeline), meaning that their sides have no ridge line and are nearly flat, unlike the structure of a katana. Some have particularly thick cross-sections for armor-piercing duty, and are called .

 were mostly carried by samurai; commoners did not generally wear them. Women sometimes carried a small called a in their , primarily for self-defense. were sometimes worn as the in place of a in a , especially on the battlefield. Before the advent of the combination, it was common for a samurai to carry a and a as opposed to a katana and a .

It has been noted that the would be paired with a and later the katana would be paired with another shorter katana. With the advent of the katana, the was eventually chosen by samurai as the short sword of choice over the . Kanzan Satō, in his book &quot;The Japanese Sword&quot;, notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the , and suggests that the may have become more popular than the due to the being more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the inside.

==History of in Japan==
The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:
* Jōkotō (ancient swords, until around 900 AD)
* Kotō (old swords from around 900–1596)
* Shintō (new swords 1596–1780)
* Shinshintō (new new swords 1781–1876)
* Gendaitō (modern swords 1876–1945)
* Shinsakutō (newly made swords 1953–present)

===Heian to Muromachi periods===
The was invented partway through the Heian period. With the beginning of the Kamakura period, were forged to be more aesthetically pleasing, and and became the most popular styles. Near the middle of the Kamakura period, more artisans were seen, increasing the abundance of the weapon, and the style became prevalent in the cities of Kyoto and Yamato. Because of the style introduced by the in the late Kamakura period, began to be forged longer and wider. The introduction of the Hachiman faith became visible in the carvings in the hilts around this time. The (line of temper) is similar to that of the , except for the absence of , which is and . and are found to have taken its place.

During the era of the Northern and Southern Courts, the were forged to be up to in length, as opposed to the normal one (about ) length. The blades became thinner between the and the , and wider between the and . At this point in time, two styles of were prevalent: the older style, which was subtle and artistic, and the newer, more popular style. With the beginning of the Muromachi period, constant fighting caused the mass production of blades, meaning that with higher demand, lower-quality blades were manufactured. Blades that were custom-forged still were of exceptional quality, but the average blade suffered greatly. As the end of the period neared, the average blade narrowed and the curvature shallowed.

Katana originate from , a kind of used by lower-ranking samurai who fought on foot in the Kamakura period. Their main weapon was a long , with the as a spare weapon. In the Nanboku-chō period, which corresponds to the early Muromachi period, long weapons such as were popular, and along with this, the lengthened, taking its form as the katana.

===Momoyama to the early Edo period===

Approximately 250 years of peace accompanied the unification of Japan, in which there was little need for blades. In this period, both the katana and were invented, taking the place of the and as the most-used pair of weapons, and the number of forged was severely decreased. Since this period, have often been carved with splendid decorations. Of the and forged during this period, three masterpieces are called the .

===Late Edo period===

There were still a few being forged during the late Edo period, and the ones that were forged reflected the work of the Kamakura, Nambokucho, or Muromachi eras. Suishinshi Masahide was a main contributor towards the forging of during this age. There were now only predating the Edo period being used in combat; forged during the late Edo period were not combative weapons.

===Meiji to present===
Many were forged before World War II, due to the restoration of the Emperor to power. Members of the Imperial Court began wearing the set of and once more, and the number of in existence increased dramatically. After World War II, a restriction on sword forging caused manufacture to fall drastically.

 remained in use among twentieth century yakuza (gangsters) since they could be carried as a concealed weapon more easily than a katana. A is also traditionally used in the &quot;yubitsume&quot; ritual (cutting off part of a finger as an act of submission or atonement).

American and European interest in Japanese martial arts since the war created a demand for the outside Japan from the 1960s through the present time.

==Types of ==
===Blade types===
*: A very common form with no , the edge bevels reaching all the way from the edge () to the back () with no separate flats in between, creating an almost triangular cross-section (the back is ridged, as on most other blade forms, so the cross-section is actually an extremely asymmetrical diamond shape; on blades it is hexagonal). It is extremely common due to the simplicity of its design.
*: This is the most common type of blade geometry for long swords, but made in this form are very rare, usually created from cut-down blades when a longer sword has been broken. means the central ridge that runs along the length of the blade between the edge bevels and the body of the blade.
*: feature an extremely long type point, over half the blade&#x27;s length.
*: A common blade type that is very similar to the , except that it lacks a , the distinct angle between the long cutting edge and the point section, and instead the edge curves smoothly and uninterrupted into the point.
*: An uncommon style akin to the , with a back that grows abruptly thinner around the middle of the blade; however, the regains its thickness just before the point. There is normally a short, wide groove extending to the midway point on the blade.
*: These were shaped in the or style, but from about halfway to the tip the back edge was sharpened though this second edge was not particularly sharp. They had a groove running halfway up the blade and were similar to the -style .
*: A rare blade type with a double-edged point. Unlike the later the tip had a distinct shape unlike any other : the back edge would curve slightly downwards so that the point was lower than the back of the blade whereas other had the point in line with the back of the blade. Often they had a wide groove in the base half. The most well known historical blade of this type is the Kogarasu Maru, &quot;Little Crow&quot;, one of the National Treasures of Japan.
*: A rare, double-edged type that has a diamond-shaped cross-section. The blade tapers to a point and contains a that runs to the point.
*: that have particularly thick cross-sections for armor-piercing duty.
*: An asymmetric form, sharpened only on one side to create a chisel-shaped cross-section.
*: A very rare type; the sharpened blade is on the inside curve rather than the outside. It has no sharpened point, making it difficult to use in battle and enshrouding the weapon in mystery. means . According to one myth, they were carried by attendants of samurai for cutting off the heads of fallen enemies. There are other speculations existing about the &#x27;s possible uses. Perhaps they were used by doctors or carried by high-ranking officials as a badge is worn today. They could also have been used for cutting charcoal or incense, or used as an artistic tool for pruning bonsai trees.
*: A form that is commonly described as a short, wide, . The () was one of the blade type that the legendary swordsmith Masamune favored.

===Mountings ()===

*: The is a where the is flush with the mouth of the sheath. There is no handguard. normally have plain wooden hilts, and many forms of have that are made from animal horns.
*: The is a that features a small handguard.

=== Western Tanto ===
A popular style of blade, known simply as a Tanto in the US and Europe, is similar in style to the Tantō except that the tip is squared at a shearing angle instead of curved.

The shearing angle may facilitate the stabbing effectiveness of the blade, and make the process of sharpening simpler.

This style of blade is commercially popular, and was used by CIA field agents in the wake of 9/11.

The Bundeswehr is among the few millitaries (if not the only) that issues a &quot;tantō&quot;-style military knife in significant numbers. It is designated as the KM2000.

===Other ===

*: The (also or ) is a generally short that is commonly carried in or mounts. It was useful for self-defense indoors where the long katana and intermediate were inconvenient. Women carried them in the obi for self-defense and rarely for (ritual suicide). A woman received a as part of her wedding gifts.
*Fan : The fan is a common with a blade entirely concealed within a fan-shaped scabbard. The blade was usually low quality, as this was not designed to be a display piece, but rather a concealed weapon for self-defense.
*: Japanese spearheads were often altered so that it became possible to mount them as . Unlike most blades, had triangular cross-sections.
*: This is also not truly a , though it is often used and thought of as one. were straight, double-edged blades often used for Buddhist rituals, and could be made from spearheads that were broken or cut shorter. They were often given as offerings from sword smiths when they visited a temple. The hilt of the may be found made with a &quot;vajra&quot; (double thunderbolt related to Buddhism).
*Modern : Modern tactical knives have been made by knife makers Bob Lum, Phill Hartsfield, Ernest Emerson, Allen Elishewitz, Bob Terzuola, Strider Knives, Harold J. &quot;Kit&quot; Carson, Benchmade, Camillus Cutlery Company, Spyderco, Severtech, Ka-Bar, SOG Knives, Columbia River Knife &amp; Tool, and Cold Steel. These &quot;American &quot; designs which are often folding knives, feature a thick spine on the blade that goes from the tang to the tip for increased tip strength. The handle shape may be altered slightly to provide better ergonomics.

He became mayor of Springfield in 1859, and then a member of the State Senate in 1860, but resigned in 1861 to accept the appointment by President Lincoln to be the first Governor of Dakota Territory. He served from May 27, 1861, until 1863, then as a Delegate to the House of Representatives from March 4, 1863, to June 17, 1864.

Jayne then returned to Springfield and continued the practice of medicine. He was appointed U.S. Pension Agent in 1869 for four years and served three terms as mayor of Springfield beginning in 1876. He also served as Director and Vice President of the First National Bank of Springfield. He resumed the practice of medicine in 1873.

<text>Richard Garrick (December 27, 1878 – August 21, 1962) was an Irish-born American actor and director.

== Life and career ==
Garrick was born Richard Thomas O&#x27;Brien in the townland of Portlaw, County Waterford, Ireland. His father, James E. O&#x27;Brien, was a master tailor in that town, counting among his clients Lord Waterford as well as other nobility and landed gentry. In 1882, James left Portlaw for the United States. He landed in North Adams, Massachusetts, where there were cotton mills and the need for a clothesmaker. Two years later, his wife Johanna and children followed.

In 1898, Garrick enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served as a corporal in Company M, U.S. 26th Infantry Regiment stationed in Miagao, Iloilo, in the Philippines in 1900 during the Philippine–American War. When he returned to North Adams, he worked for a time in his father&#x27;s tailor shop, then struck out on his own.

He ventured to New York City where he landed roles in stage productions, among them &quot;The Boys of Company B&quot; (1907), &quot;The Flag Lieutenant&quot; (1909), &quot;The Fourth Estate,&quot; (1909), and &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;. By 1912 Garrick was in Los Angeles and became a charter member of The Reel Club. Through the early 1910s, Garrick acted in, as well as directed, silent films, including &quot;Colonel Custard&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; (1914). In 1915, he joined the Gaumont Company and was placed in charge of the second Rialto Star Feature Company. By 1916, Garrick was the director general of Gaumont&#x27;s Jacksonville, Florida, studios. He left Gaumont to open Garrick Studios Company, offering a five-acre (20,000 m2) facility in Jacksonville that would house enough equipment and space for 20 companies to work simultaneously. As the 1916–1917 season approached, however, the mood towards making films in Jacksonville shifted, and many residents opposed the industry&#x27;s presence.

Garrick went overseas in 1919 and directed films in London and Paris. In 1922, he was named production manager of a new film corporation in Italy. Overall, he directed 30 silent films during his career. When he returned to the United States, it was to pursue his first love — stage acting. During World War II, he was among the cast of &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, a production of the U.S. Army Special Service/USO Camp Shows in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.

In 1947, Garrick was once again on stage in New York City, performing as the mental-health doctor or &quot;stranger&quot; in the original production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, which co-starred Marlon Brando and Jessica Tandy. He reprised that role in the 1951 film version of the play. His appearances in both the play and film adaptation marked the start of a second film career for Garrick. During the 1950s, he played small supporting roles in numerous Hollywood movies. 
His television acting credits include the role of Benjamin Franklin in &quot;Night Strike&quot; on &quot;Calvacade of America&quot; (April 29, 1953 and October 19, 1954); and the role of Thaddeus Grimshaw in the episode &quot;Royal Carriage&quot; on &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;My Friend Flicka (March 16, 1956).

Throughout his career, Garrick performed along with some of the brightest actors and actresses in stage and film history, including James Arness, Ed Begley, Marlon Brando, Lee J. Cobb, James Dean, Julie Harris, Brian Keith, Charles Laughton, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden, Victor Mature, Ethel Merman, Marilyn Monroe, Patricia Neal, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, Anthony Quinn, Ronald Reagan, Ginger Rogers, Jean Simmons, Richard Todd, Spencer Tracy, Robert Wagner, John Wayne, Dennis Weaver and Richard Widmark.

Garrick taught at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and in 1930 he opened the Richard Garrick Studio in Santa Ana, California, to teach drama, English, public speaking, and other subjects to aspiring actors.

Garrick died on August 21, 1962, in Los Angeles and is buried as a U.S. veteran at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California.

<doc id="309563" wikidata="Q838183" url="?curid=309563" title="Alt.suicide.holiday">
<text>alt.suicide.holiday (a.s.h, ASH or ash) is a Usenet newsgroup. Its original purpose was to discuss the relationship between suicide rates and holiday seasons. However, it later evolved into a broad discussion forum where suicidal people can openly share their struggles or research suicide methods. Some participants are not suicidal, but post to provide psychological support or advice on how to kill oneself to suicidal or depressed posters. The newsgroup was unmoderated and was subject to occasional bouts of trolling and a harsh and sometimes hostile atmosphere, in mid-2002 the trolling heightened significantly and ended up driving away many regular users. According to its FAQ, its purpose is neither to encourage nor discourage suicide and strongly maintains a pro-choice view on the matter.

==Effects==
Research from 2007 shows that suicide websites indeed could be more efficient in providing emotional help for people contemplating suicide than suicide hotlines. The primary reasons are the asynchronous nature of discussion in newsgroups giving enough time for thoughtful responses and group-based discussion that suicidal people find reassuring. The high degree of anonymity is another advantage of newsgroups like a.s.h, allowing people to openly talk about their feelings without fear of consequences.

UK Byron Review for 2008, analyzing the effects of websites on children, says that &quot;research looking at pro-suicide sites has had mixed results. Some studies report high degrees of emotional and social support by these sites, particularly on sites where the methods of suicide were not discussed. More studies like this are needed to begin to understand the impact of such sites on those who spontaneously choose to access them.&quot;

==Suicide information==
Due to the nature of Usenet information on suicide methods is not and cannot be censored.

==Coverage in the news==
The newsgroup has been a target of news reports alleging a direct relationship between &quot;avoidable&quot; suicides and the suicide-facilitating nature of the newsgroup and website.

In 2003, a.s.h was the topic of a series of &quot;Wired&quot; articles under the pretext of examining the group&#x27;s role in the deaths of several depressed individuals. The accuracy and integrity of the articles was widely disputed by ashers and internet media critics, e.g., &quot;Ken Hagler&#x27;s Radio Weblog: No One Asked Why He Wanted to Die&quot;.

A.s.h played some role in the death of Suzy Gonzales, who killed herself in 2003 after sharing her thoughts on a.s.h. In the US, the death of Suzy Gonzales led to an attempt to introduce a controversial H.R. 940: Suzanne Gonzales Suicide Prevention Act of 2007, which did not pass. The current version of the bill is HR 1183: Suzanne Gonzales Suicide Prevention Act of 2011.

The community received further media attention due to the case of William Francis Melchert-Dinkel, who was charged by Rice County District Judge Thomas Neuville with encouraging the suicides of a person in Britain in 2005 and another person in Canada in 2008 through a.s.h.

<text>Spiritual warfare is the Christian concept of fighting against the work of preternatural evil forces. It is based on the belief in evil spirits, or demons, that are said to intervene in human affairs in various ways. Although spiritual warfare is a prominent feature of neo-charismatic churches, various other Christian denominations and groups have also adopted practices rooted in the concepts of spiritual warfare, with Christian demonology often playing a key role in these practices and beliefs, or had older traditions of such a concept unrelated to the neo-charismatic movement, such as the exorcistic prayers of the Catholic Church and the various Eastern Orthodox churches. The term &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; is used broadly by different Christian movements and in different contexts: &quot;by charismatics, evangelicals, and Calvinists, and applied to missiology, counseling, and women.&quot;

Prayer is one common form of spiritual warfare practiced amongst these Christians. Other practices may include exorcism, the laying on of hands, fasting with prayer, praise and worship, and anointing with oil.

== Doctrines of spiritual warfare and exorcism ==
===Mainstream Christian demonology===
Mainstream Christianity typically acknowledges a belief in the existence (or ontological existence) of demons, fallen angels, the Devil and Satan. In Christian evangelism, doctrines of demonology are influenced by interpretations of the New Testament, namely interpretations of the Gospels, in that dealing with spirits became a customary activity of Jesus&#x27; ministry. Mark the Evangelist states that &quot;he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons&quot; ().

===Spiritual warfare in the Apostle Paul===
 
The Apostle Paul has traditionally been attributed as the writer of the Book of Ephesians, the tenth book of the New Testament, although it is more likely the work of one of his disciples. Within 6:10–12 of Ephesians, Paul addresses spiritual warfare and how to combat spiritual attacks; &quot;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.&quot; The majority of modern spiritual warfare theology is based on this chapter of Ephesians.

===Evangelical Christian demonology===
Evangelical Christian denominations typically believe that Satan and his agents exert significant influence over the world and its power structures. They believe that a conflict exists involving territorial spirits or other hostile spiritual forces, based on passages such as (&quot;the whole world is under the control of the evil one&quot;) and , and , where Jesus refers to Satan as &quot;the prince of this world&quot;. Other verses cited include the apostle Paul&#x27;s elaboration on a hierarchy of &quot;rulers&quot;, in , taken to be &quot;demonic&quot; in interpretation. They also believe that Paul&#x27;s epistles focus on Jesus&#x27; victory over these powers. To this end, evangelical interpretations divide history into two eras: the &quot;present evil age&quot;, and the &quot;age to come&quot;, in reference to the Second Coming of Jesus.

Evangelical imagery of spiritual warfare is derived from various parts of the Bible, particularly the Book of Revelation wherein the &#x27;beasts&#x27; and &#x27;kings of the earth&#x27; wage war against God&#x27;s people () after the War in Heaven (), sparking a final battle with Satan and earthly nations against God ().

Evangelical Christians base the practice of exorcism on their understanding of Jesus&#x27; statement &quot;If I drive out demons by the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is upon you&quot; at , .

==Practices in Christianity==
===Catholic practices===
The most notable of spiritual warfare prayers in the Catholic tradition is known as the Prayer to Saint Michael the Archangel.

Pope John Paul II stated that &quot;&#x27;Spiritual combat&#x27;... is a secret and interior art, an invisible struggle in which monks engage every day against the temptations&quot;.

In modern times, the views of individual Roman Catholics of spiritual warfare have tended to divide into traditional and more modern understandings of the subject. An example of a more modern view of the demonic is found in the work of the Dominican scholar Richard Woods&#x27; &quot;The Devil&quot;.

The traditional outlook is represented by Father Gabriele Amorth, who has written three books on his personal experiences as an exorcist for the Vatican: &quot;An Exorcist Tells His Story&quot;, and &quot;An Exorcist: More Stories&quot;, and &quot;An Exorcist Explains the Demonic: The Antics of Satan and His Army of Fallen Angels&quot;. Francis MacNutt, who was a priest within the Roman Catholic Charismatic movement, has also addressed the subject of the demonic in his writings about healing.

=== Lutheranism, Anglicanism and Reformed Christianity ===

The practice of exorcism was also known among the first generation of teachers and pastors in the Lutheran Reformation. Johannes Bugenhagen was the pastor of the Wittenberg town church and officiated at Martin Luther&#x27;s wedding. In a letter addressed to Luther and Melanchthon dated November 1530, Pomeranus recounted his experience of dealing with a young girl who showed signs of demon possession. Pomeranus&#x27; method involved counseling the girl concerning her previous baptismal vows, he invoked the name of Christ and prayed with her. (Letter reproduced in Montgomery, &quot;Principalities and Powers&quot;).

The Anglican-Puritan writer William Gurnall wrote a lengthy three-volume work, &quot;The Christian in Complete Armour&quot;, published between 1662 and 1665. In this work Gurnall stressed the place of reading Scripture, prayer and the name of Christ.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy ===
===Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, and the Charismatic movement===
In the American revival tradition among evangelicals, prominent 19th- and 20th-century preachers such as D. L. Moody, Billy Sunday, R. A. Torrey and Billy Graham have all affirmed their belief in the existence of the demonic and had occasions to recount some of their own spiritual warfare encounters. In the 19th century, one of the major evangelical authorities on demon possession was the missionary to China, John Livingstone Nevius.

Spiritual warfare has become a prominent feature in Pentecostal traditions and the concept is well embedded in Pentecostal history. Expositors of spiritual warfare include Jessie Penn-Lewis, who published the Pentecostal 1903 book &quot;War on the Saints&quot;, arising from the Welsh Revival in the early twentieth century. Starting in the 1950s with the charismatic Latter Rain movement, demonology began to grow in importance. British charismatic Michael Harper popularised the term &quot;spiritual warfare&quot; in his 1970 book of the same name. In 1976, prolific author Pastor Win Worley began the publication of his &quot;Hosts of Hell&quot; series, containing elements of the concept of spiritual warfare, if not explicitly using the expression. The third-wave charismatic movement of today—notably C. Peter Wagner and Cindy Jacobs – have been at the forefront of newer conceptions of spiritual warfare.

Since the 1980s, the concept has spread from the charismatic world to broader evangelicalism; traditional boundaries between the two on the issue have eroded. This form of spiritual warfare has become especially popular among American evangelicals. American studies scholar S. Jonathon O&#x27;Donnell defines spiritual warfare: &quot;A key idea in spiritual warfare is that demons don’t only attack people, as in depictions of demonic possession, but also take control of places and institutions, such as journalism, academia, and both municipal and federal bureaucracies. By doing so, demons are framed as advancing social projects that spiritual warriors see as opposing God’s plans.&quot; In 1991, Wagner published &quot;Confronting the Powers: How the New Testament Church Experienced the Power of Strategic-Level Spiritual Warfare&quot; and edited &quot;Territorial Spirits&quot;. In 1992, Dr. Ed Murphy wrote a modern 600-page book on the subject, &quot;The Handbook of Spiritual Warfare&quot;, from the point of view of deliverance ministry. &quot;Laws of Deliverance, From Proverbs&quot; (1980, 1983, 1995, 2000, 2003), written by Marilyn A. Ellsworth, is another important work of authority, as is her book &quot;ICBM Spiritual Warfare, God&#x27;s Unbeatable Plan&quot;. Other Pentecostal and charismatic pastors include Don Basham, Derek Prince, Bishop Larry Gaiters, Reverend Miguel Bustillos, Dr. Marcus Haggard, and missionary Norman Parish, who have emphasized using the power of the blood of Christ in the deliverance ministry.

Sean McCloud comments, &quot;In addition to shared supernatural themes, Third Wave spiritual warfare manuals resemble—and even cite—the occult grimoires they attack as demonic&quot;.

During the late 20th century, Evangelical writers such as Mark Bubeck and Merrill Unger presented their theological and pastoral response to demonic phenomena. The problem of demon possession and spiritual warfare became the subject of a Christian Medical Association symposium that was held in 1975. This symposium brought together a range of evangelical scholars in biblical studies, theology, psychology, anthropology, and missiology.

One of the most significant German writers is the Lutheran Kurt E. Koch whose work, including the 1973 book &quot;Occult ABC&quot;, has influenced much of both evangelical and charismatic thought in the late twentieth century. The impact of his ideas has been recently examined by the folklore specialist Bill Ellis.

The development of specific spiritual warfare techniques has also generated many discussions in the Christian missions community. Critical exchanges of views may be found in periodicals such as the &quot;Evangelical Missions Quarterly&quot; and in conferences sponsored by the Evangelical Missions Society. In 2000, an international collaborative attempt was made by evangelicals and charismatics in the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization to reach some common agreement about spiritual warfare. The conference gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, and yielded a consultation document as well as many technical papers published as the book &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot;.

==== Spiritual mapping and the Charismatic movement ====

&quot;Spiritual mapping&quot; refers to the 21st-century belief among some Evangelicals that all history is a battle between Satan and God and that there are currently specific demons associated with specific locations (territorial spirits). Neo-Evangelicals who follow the spiritual mapping movement believe that these demons are the reason of lack of success for Christian missionaries and that they can use prayer and other Evangelical religious practices to counteract and drive out these demons. This, in turn, will accelerate the second coming of Christ. Missiologist George Otis coined the term in 1990 and C. Peter Wagner was a key figure in popularizing the concept.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe they are engaged in a &quot;spiritual, theocratic warfare&quot; against false teachings and wicked spirit forces they say try to impede them in their preaching work. Where their religious beliefs have been in conflict with national laws or other authorities—particularly in countries where their work is banned—they have advocated the use of &quot;theocratic war strategy&quot; to protect their interests, by hiding the truth from God&#x27;s &quot;enemies&quot;, being evasive, or withholding truthful or incriminating information. &quot;The Watchtower&quot; told Witnesses: &quot;It is proper to cover over our arrangements for the work that God commands us to do. If the wolfish foes draw wrong conclusions from our maneuvers to outwit them, no harm has been done to them by the harmless sheep, innocent in their motives as doves.&quot;

==Christian teachings on the occult==

In May 2021, the Baptist Deliverance Study Group of the Baptist Union of Great Britain, a Christian denomination, issued a &quot;warning against occult spirituality following the rise in people trying to communicate with the dead&quot;. The commission reported that &quot;Becoming involved in activities such as Spiritualism can open up a doorway to great spiritual oppression which requires a Christian rite to set that person free.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Outside of Evangelicalism, many Christians explicitly reject the concept of spiritual warfare. In Germany, the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Germany and the German Evangelical Alliance consider it to be &quot;unbiblical&quot;, stating &quot;The aggressive attitude and the presumption to fight against evil alongside or even instead of Christ, stands in opposition to the spirit of the gospel.&quot; The German Evangelical Alliance published a statement denouncing the 2001 spiritual warfare trip C. Peter Wagner and his organization Global Harvest Ministries undertook to defeat the territorial spirit known as the Queen of Heaven, which Wagner and associates believed prevented Christian missions within the 40/70 window.

In evangelism and worldwide Christian missions, former missionaries such as Charles Kraft and C. Peter Wagner have emphasized problems with demonic influences on the world mission fields and the need to drive demons out. Robert Guelich of Fuller Theological Seminary has questioned the extent to which spiritual warfare has shifted from its basic moorings from being a metaphor for the Christian life. He underlines how spiritual warfare has evolved into &quot;spiritual combat&quot; techniques for Christians to seek power over demons. Guelich argues that the writings of the Apostle Paul in the Epistle through Ephesians are focused on proclaiming the peace of God and nowhere specify any techniques for battling demons. He also argues that the novels of Frank Peretti are at odds with both the gospel narratives on demons and Pauline teaching.

Missions specialists such Scott Moreau and Paul Hiebert have detected traces of animist thought encroaching on both evangelical and charismatic discourses about the demonic and spiritual warfare. Hiebert indicates that a dualist cosmology now appears in some spiritual warfare texts and it is based on the Greco-Roman mystery religions and Zoroastrian myths. However, Hiebert also chastises other evangelicals who have absorbed the modern secular outlook and have tended to downplay or even ignore the demonic. Hiebert speaks of the flaw of the excluded middle in the thinking of some evangelicals who have a cosmology of God in heaven and humans on earth, but have ignored the &quot;middle&quot; realm of the angelic and demonic.

American studies scholar S. Jonathan O&#x27;Donnell argues that &quot;QAnon has many overlaps with spiritual warfare and its practitioners&quot; and that demons are seen as part of the deep state, which ties in to Christian nationalism.

Some critics have linked the rise in aggressive forms of prayer to the increasing militarization of everyday life that characterizes 20th century cultural shifts towards the widespread normalization of highly militarized discourse, particularly in the practices and rituals of religious prayer and conversion. Matthew D. Taylor says the language of spiritual warfare incites real-world violence against those labeled as possessed by demons and worries that rhetoric threatens democracy since one cannot negotiate with demons in good faith.

E. Janet Warren argues that the term has gone from its original use as an insightful metaphor in the Bible to losing its sense as a metaphor in modern Christian language.

===Christian countercult movement===
The excesses of allegations made in the satanic ritual abuse phenomenon of the 1980s and 1990s have prompted critical reviews of spiritual warfare thought and practices. Some apologists in the Christian countercult movement have expressed concerns that spiritual warfare techniques seem at times to have been based on spurious stories and anecdotes without careful discernment and reflection. Some of these general concerns have been expressed by apologists like Elliot Miller (Christian Research Institute), and Bob and Gretchen Passantino in various articles published in the &quot;Christian Research Journal&quot;. Others, such as Mike Hertenstein and Jon Trott, have called into question the claims of alleged ex-Satanists like Mike Warnke and Lauren Stratford whose stories have subsequently influenced many popular books about spiritual warfare and the occult. Bill Ellis&#x27;s work, &quot;Raising the Devil&quot;, has detected the presence of folkloric stories about the occult and demons circulating in evangelical and charismatic circles, which later become accepted as unquestioned facts.

==Cultural influence==
Popular fictional portrayals of spiritual warfare are found in novels by Frank E. Peretti, &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; and &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot;, and &quot;Darrin J Mason&quot;, &quot;Ominous&quot;.

Spiritual warfare themes are also present in songs by contemporary Christian music artists, such as Petra and Carman.

In ReelWorksStudios and Liberty University&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;The Trump Prophecy&quot;, &quot;victory over demons is paralleled with the mass expulsion of undocumented migrants.&quot;

<doc id="309566" wikidata="Q1686407" url="?curid=309566" title="Jefferson P. Kidder">
<text>Jefferson Parish Kidder (June 4, 1815 – October 2, 1883) was an American lawyer and jurist. He served as the non-voting delegate from the Dakota Territory to the United States House of Representatives. Kidder was the only Democratic lieutenant governor of Vermont until John J. Daley in 1965.

==Early life==
Kidder was born in Braintree, Vermont on June 4, 1815. He attended the Orange County Grammar School in Randolph, and graduated from Alden Partridge&#x27;s American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy (Norwich University) in 1834. He studied law in Montpelier, was admitted to the bar in 1839 and practiced in Braintree and West Randolph. Among the prospective attorneys who studied law under Kidder&#x27;s supervision were John W. Rowell, who went on to serve as chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court and Carl C. Pope, a legislator and judge in Wisconsin.

==Career==
He was a member of the Vermont Constitutional Convention in 1843. He served as State&#x27;s Attorney for Orange County (1842-1847), a member of the Vermont State Senate (1847-1849), the Lieutenant Governor of Vermont (1852-1853), and a delegate to the 1856 Democratic National Convention.

In 1848 he received the honorary degree of Master of Arts from the University of Vermont.

In 1857 Kidder moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he joined the Republican Party.

In 1859, Kidder moved to Dakota Territory and became a delegate to Congress from the provisional government at Sioux Falls.

In 1862 and 1863, he was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. In 1865 he moved to Vermillion, Dakota Territory, when Abraham Lincoln appointed him an associate justice of the territorial Supreme Court.

In 1874, he was elected as the territory&#x27;s delegate to Congress. He served from March 4, 1875 to March 3, 1879 and was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1878.

1879, Kidder was reappointed to the Supreme Court of Dakota Territory. He served until his death in 1883.

==Death and burial==
Kidder died in St. Paul on October 2, 1883. He was buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Oakland Cemetery.

==Family==
His son Lyman Kidder was a U.S. Cavalry 2nd lieutenant serving in the 2nd Cavalry under George Armstrong Custer, and was killed in action in what would be dubbed the Kidder massacre.

Jefferson Kidder was also the grandfather of noted lawman and Arizona Ranger Jeff Kidder.

==Legacy==
Kidder County, North Dakota is named for him.

<doc id="309568" wikidata="Q863213" url="?curid=309568" title="Billy Shaw">
<text>William Lewis Shaw (December 15, 1938 – October 4, 2024) was an American professional football player who was a guard for the Buffalo Bills in the American Football League (AFL). After playing college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, he was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 1961 AFL draft. Shaw was the prototypical &quot;pulling guard&quot; who despite his size held his own against much bigger defensive linemen like Ernie Ladd, Earl Faison and Buck Buchanan. He won three straight Eastern Division titles and two AFL championships in 1964 and 1965 with Buffalo.

Shaw was a first-team All-AFL selection five times (1962–1966) and second-team All-AFL in 1968 and 1969. He played in eight AFL All-Star Games and was named to the All-Time All-AFL Team. He made the All-Decade All-Pro football team of the 1960s. Shaw played his entire career in the AFL, and retired after the 1969 season. He is the only member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame who never played in the National Football League (NFL).

== Early life==
Born on December 15, 1938, in Natchez, Mississippi, Shaw played sports all throughout his childhood. He attended Jett High School from 1953 to 1955, a small country school right outside of Vicksburg. He played as an end until the school dropped its football program. 

In 1956, his father moved the family into Vicksburg so Shaw could continue to play football at the larger Carr Central High School. Weighing in at 188 pounds Shaw played offensive and defensive tackle during his senior year.

== College career ==
At Georgia Tech, Shaw was a two-way player from 1957 to 1960, at offensive tackle and defensive tackle. He was named to the All-Freshman Team in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

By his senior year, Shaw weighed in at 220 pounds, earning SEC Most Valuable Lineman, All-SEC and All-American honors. &quot;Actually,&quot; Shaw once said, &quot;I thought I played defense much better than offense, and I still believe most of the honors I received were for my defensive play.&quot;

After the season, Shaw was named to the 1961 College All-Star Team. The coach worked him for two weeks as a defensive end until guard Houston Antwine injured his ankle. This was when Shaw began playing guard. The College All-Star Team that year played the Philadelphia Eagles. &quot;I was scared to death,&quot; Shaw recalled about playing the NFL champion Eagles in the annual all-star contest. &quot;I was up against Ed Khayat, a Mississippi boy who later finished his career with Boston (Patriots). I thought this might ease the tension a bit since he might take it easier on me. It was just the opposite. He turned me every way but loose.&quot; Shaw held his own, knocking the wind out of Eagle linebacker Maxie Baughan (who had been his roommate in college) on a big hit that attracted the attention of spectators.

In 1979, he was inducted into the Georgia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. He was named to the All-Time Bobby Dodd era Georgia Tech team. In 1985, he was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.

== Professional career ==
Shaw was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the second round (9th overall) of the 1961 AFL draft and by the Dallas Cowboys in the 14th round (184th overall) of the 1961 NFL draft. &quot;I had been in contact with the Cowboys mostly prior to the Bills getting involved,&quot; recalled Shaw. &quot;The Cowboys wanted to play me at linebacker. We had lengthy conversations at that point in time. The Bills wanted to play me at either defensive end or an offensive line position. I really wanted to play on the defensive side of the ball as a defensive end. So that triggered a real interest for me (in the Bills).&quot; When it became clear that the Bills wanted Shaw to play guard, he still preferred playing for the Bills because he felt that his size and speed would make guard a more suitable position for him than linebacker, which was a position he had never played before. Additionally, his Georgia Tech coach, Bobby Dodd, encouraged Shaw to play for Buffalo.

As a rookie, he became a starter at left guard and played in all 14 games, an accomplishment he matched for the first six seasons of his career. He contributed to the team winning the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. In 1967, he suffered a right knee injury in training camp, which forced him to miss five games. He returned to All-Star form the next two years.

With Bills&#x27; running backs tending to be more durable than fast, Shaw became dominant as a pulling guard, often staying in front of the runners far down field. Shaw was known as &quot;the driving force of the offensive unit.&quot; He was especially adept on short-yardage situations, when he would pull out from his left guard position followed by Cookie Gilchrist, Wray Carlton, Daryle Lamonica or Jack Kemp.

Shaw was a first-team All-AFL selection four times (1963–1966) and second-team All-AFL in 1968 and 1969. He played in eight AFL All-Star Games and was named to the AFL All-Time Team. He made the All-Decade All-Pro football team of the 1960s. Shaw played his entire career in the AFL, and retired after the 1969 AFL season, before the AFL–NFL merger. The 1962–1964 Bills are still ranked among the best in rushing touchdowns in a season in the team&#x27;s record book.

In 1999, Shaw became the first and only player ever inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame without ever playing in the NFL. (The Bills, along with the rest of the AFL, merged with the NFL the season following his retirement.) During his speech, he forgot to thank his wife, Patsy. After taking pictures, he went back on stage and got on his knees and apologized. 

In 1994, he was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. In 1988, he was inducted into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame. In 2009, he was named to the Bills&#x27; 50th Anniversary Team.

== Personal life and death ==
Shaw married his wife, Patsy, in 1960, and they had three children.
Shaw died from hyponatremia at his home in Toccoa, Georgia, on October 4, 2024, at the age of 85.

<text>George Arthur Mathews (June 4, 1852 – April 19, 1941) was an American lawyer of Brookings, South Dakota. He was active in the government of the Dakota Territory, and was a territorial delegate to the United States House of Representatives.

==Early life==
George A. Mathews was born in Potsdam, New York on June 4, 1852, the son of Amos Mathews and Silence A. (Folsom) Mathews. He was raised and educated in Potsdam until he was 13, when his family moved to Fayette, Iowa. After completing his early education in Fayette, Mathews studied at Upper Iowa University in Fayette, from which he graduated in 1874. He then studied law at the University of Iowa, from which he graduated in 1878. He was admitted to the bar in 1878 and commenced practice in Corning, Iowa.

==Career==
Mathews moved to Brookings, Dakota Territory (now South Dakota) in 1879. In 1881, he was elected to Brookings&#x27; first city council. He served as mayor of Brookings from 1883 to 1884. In 1883, Mathews served on the commission that considered relocation of the territorial from Yankton. He proposed Huron as the most suitable site, but the majority voted for Bismarck. In 1884 he became prosecuting attorney of the fifth judicial circuit for the Territory of Dakota. In 1884, he was also elected to the Territorial council, and he was the council&#x27;s president in 1887 and 1888. He was mayor of Brookings again from 1887 to 1889.

In 1888, Mathews was elected as a Republican to be the Territorial delegate to the U.S. House. He served from March 4, 1889 until November 2, 1889, when North and South Dakota were admitted into the Union. Because terms started in March, but congressional sessions began in November or December, Mathews did not travel to Washington, D.C. According to Francis Case, who eulogized Mathews in the U.S. House, because a change in presidential administrations occurred while Mathews was Dakota&#x27;s delegate, he was flooded with applications for the territory&#x27;s numerous federal patronage positions, including U.S. Marshal. Mathews and his law firm staff processed these applications and made hiring recommendations at Mathews&#x27; personal expense.

==Retirement and death==
In 1890, Mathews&#x27; political supporters proposed him as a candidate for one of the new state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats, but he declined to run. Mathews resumed practicing law, and served again as mayor of Brookings from 1897 to 1903. In 1910 he retired and moved to Los Angeles, California. He died in Los Angeles on April 19, 1941 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Brookings.

<doc id="309571" wikidata="Q444733" url="?curid=309571" title="Richard F. Pettigrew">
<text>Richard Franklin Pettigrew (July 23, 1848October 5, 1926) was an American lawyer, surveyor, and land developer. He represented the Dakota Territory in the U.S. Congress and, after the Dakotas were admitted as States, he was the first U.S. Senator from South Dakota.

==Early life and education==
Pettigrew was born to Andrew Jr. Pettigrew and Hannah B. Sawtelle on July 23, 1848, in Ludlow, Windsor County, Vermont, in the residences of his grandparents, parents, seven siblings, uncles, aunts and cousins. He was the sixth child produced out of nine total. Pettigrew&#x27;s siblings included Hannah M., Alma Jane, Henrietta Adelaide, Luella Belle, Justin A., Frederick (Fred) Wallace, Elizabeth Medora, and Harlan Page. In 1853, Andrew Jr. sold his store to the partnership of Emerson and Richards, and the family moved to Wisconsin in 1854 while Pettigrew was 6 years old. Andrew Jr. moved the family because of his neighbors&#x27; tough anti-slavery beliefs, and the store was used for the circulation of anti-slavery literature. The store was boycotted by angry, pro-slavers who threatened the Pettigrew family with violence.

The family settled in Rock County, near Union, Wisconsin. Pettigrew attended Evansville Academy, in Evansville. In 1866, Pettigrew went to Beloit to enroll in Beloit College. In the winter of 1868, Pettigrew entered law school at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

==Career in the Dakotas==
Pettigrew moved to Dakota Territory in 1869 to work with a United States deputy surveyor. He settled in Sioux Falls, where he practiced law and engaged in surveying and real estate. He was a member of the territorial House of Representatives and served on the Territorial council. He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House, serving from March 4, 1881, to March 3, 1883. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882 but returned to the territorial council from 1885 to 1889.

Pettigrew was also instrumental in the founding of many local communities around Sioux Falls by donating land. Pettigrew and his wife, Bessie, donated land in 1886 to aid the founding and development of Granite, Iowa, in Lyon County. In 1888, he and S.L. Tate both donated more land and were responsible for the founding of South Sioux Falls. Pettigrew wanted to build a suburb of Sioux Falls to the south and west.

==U.S. Senate==
When South Dakota was admitted as a state, Pettigrew was elected as South Dakota&#x27;s first Senator to the United States Senate. He served from November 2, 1889, to March 3, 1901. He introduced a bill to fund the structure, recommending that native Sioux quartzite be used for construction of the state&#x27;s first Federal building. He was re-elected in 1894, but left the Republican Party on June 17, 1896, to join the Silver Republicans, a faction of the Republican Party that opposed the party&#x27;s position in support of the monetary gold standard. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1900. 
Pettigrew was a strong opponent of President William McKinley&#x27;s attempt to annex the Republic of Hawaii against the wish of its many native residents. In a congressional speech, he stated:
&quot;The American flag went up on Hawaii in dishonor; it came down in honor, and if it goes up again now it will go up in infamy and shame and this Government will join the robber nations of the world.&quot;

His speech about Hawaii and annexation were at odds with some of his other views, namely in Federal Indian policy. Pettigrew was a supporter of a bill that sought to unilaterally dissolve tribal governments so as to force them to agree to allotment of their lands. In 1897, he delivered a speech on the Senate floor saying:
 &quot;There is no question but that the Congress of the United States at one blow should not only provide that laws passed by those councils, by those governments, should be approved by the President before they go into force, but, on the contrary, that the [tribal] governments themselves should be destroyed; that their power to legislate should be taken away; that their courts should be ousted and a proper judicial system furnished to those people. It is our duty to do it.&quot;

In the Presidential Election of 1900, while still in the Senate, he was a delegate and a major figure in the national political convention of the &quot;Fusion&quot; wing of the Populist Party held in Sioux Falls that convened on May 9, 1900, and lasted three days. The party endorsed William Jennings Bryan as its candidate.

==Indictment==
In 1917, while being interviewed by a journalist from the &quot;Argus Leader&quot;, Pettigrew offered his opinion that the First World War was a capitalist scheme intended to further enrich the wealthy, and he urged young men to evade the draft. The local United States Attorney secured a felony indictment of Pettigrew for suspicion of violating the Espionage Act of 1917, the same charge for which Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs was then presently serving a ten-year Federal prison sentence.

Pettigrew assembled a high-powered legal defense team headed up by his close personal friend, prominent attorney Clarence Darrow. The trial was repeatedly delayed, and eventually the charge against him was dropped.

Pettigrew had the formal document of indictment framed, and prominently displayed in his home next to a framed copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, where it remains to this day as part of the exhibits of the Pettigrew Home &amp; Museum.

==Later life and death==
After his time in the Senate, Pettigrew first practiced law in New York City, but soon returned to Sioux Falls and was active in politics and business until his death in that city. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Sioux Falls.

Pettigrew left his home to the city of Sioux Falls in his will. The Pettigrew Home &amp; Museum is maintained by the city of Sioux Falls to this day, designed to emulate how a person of Pettigrew&#x27;s stature would have lived at the turn of the century. The house is filled with antiques from the early 1900s and Pettigrew&#x27;s personal collection of artifacts from his time as an amateur archaeologist.

Announced January 12, 2009, Richard F. Pettigrew Elementary School opened in fall of 2009 in southwest Sioux Falls.

==Quotes==
All quotes are from Pettigrew&#x27;s book &quot;Triumphant Plutocracy&quot;.

* &quot;Capital is stolen labor and its only function is to steal more labor.&quot;
* &quot;The early years of the century marked the progress of the race toward individual freedom and permanent victory over the tyranny of hereditary aristocracy, but the closing decades of the century have witnessed the surrender of all that was gained to the more heartless tyranny of accumulated wealth.&quot;
* &quot;Under the ethics of his profession the lawyer is the only man who can take a bribe and call it a fee.&quot;
* &quot;Instead of spending hundreds of millions in conquering the Philippines, it would have been far better economy and better business judgment to spend it in reclaiming the arid lands of the west.&quot;
* &quot;The sum and substance of the conquest of the Philippines is to find a field where cheap labor can be secured, labor that does not strike, that does not belong to a union, that does not need an army to keep it in leading strings, that will make goods for the trusts of this country.&quot;
* &quot;It had come into being as a protest against slavery and as the special champion of the Declaration of Independence, it would go out of being and out of power as the champion of slavery and the repudiator of the Declaration of Independence.&quot; --–On the Republican Party.
* &quot;The Russian Revolution is the greatest event of our times. It marks the beginning of the epoch when the working people will assume the task of directing and controlling industry. It blazes a path into this unknown country, where the workers of the world are destined to take from their exploiters the right to control and direct the economic affairs of the community.&quot;

<text>Norton Parker Chipman (March 7, 1834 – February 1, 1924) was an American Civil War army officer, military prosecutor, politician, author, and judge.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in Milford Center, Ohio, to Vermont-natives Norman and Sarah Wilson (Parker) Chipman, Norton Chipman&#x27;s family moved to Iowa when he was young. He graduated from the Cincinnati Law School in 1859, prior to the school&#x27;s merger with the University of Cincinnati in its present form.

===Military career===
Having enlisted in the Union Army&#x27;s Second Iowa Infantry during the Civil War, Lieutenant Colonel Chipman fought courageously in battle and was nearly mortally wounded and carried off the battlefield, leading his commanders to report him as dead at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Chipman did, in fact, survive and, upon recovery, was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1862. Chipman and fellow Ohioan Ulysses S. Grant fought together in the Battle of Fort Donelson, which became Grant&#x27;s first major victory. Chipman was later appointed as a member of General Henry W. Halleck&#x27;s and then Samuel R. Curtis&#x27;s staff. He later became a member of the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s staff.

===Life in the District of Columbia===
By 1864, he had moved to Washington, D.C., to work at the War Department under Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. Chipman successfully prosecuted Captain Henry Wirz, the commander of the Confederacy&#x27;s infamous Andersonville prison camp, where almost 13,000 Union soldiers lost their lives. For his cruelties to prisoners of war and eleven homicides, Wirz was hanged in 1865. Chipman published his recollections of the famous Andersonville Trial in his 1911 book, &quot;The Tragedy of Andersonville&quot;.

After the Civil War, Chipman was appointed Secretary of the District of Columbia by President Ulysses S. Grant, and was later elected to Congress as a delegate from the District of Columbia, serving two terms.

While adjutant general of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), he received a note from a friend in Cincinnati. The note suggested that the United States mimic the European custom of decorating graves of people who died while serving in the military. Chipman loved the idea, and he decided the day should be late in the spring, in order to make sure mature flowers were available. Because May 31 fell on a Sunday that year, he declared May 30, 1868, to be Decoration Day, a day to decorate the graves of fallen soldiers from the Civil War. The Associated Press published the order around the country. Decoration Day later became Memorial Day.

This myth that Chipman initiated the order creating Memorial Day appears to originate from the 1889 &quot;History of the Grand Army of the Republic&quot; by Robert Burns Beath, published three years after General John A. Logan’s death. It is one of many hoaxes deemed apocryphal by Bellware and Gardiner in &quot;The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America.&quot; In their book, Bellware and Gardiner note that Logan spoke to a group of veterans on July 4, 1866, mentioning the various Southern tributes that occurred that Spring. No one, including Mrs. Logan, Martha Kimball or Norton Chipman (who each claimed to have originated the idea) had to inform Logan about these tributes in 1868, as he became well aware of them two years earlier. Beath actually implies that this order was, instead, an adoption of a Southern custom as the holiday was “generally observed … in the Southern states.” As Adjutant General, Chipman’s name appeared along with Logan, the GAR&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief, on his famous 1868 Order No. 11 published in newspapers across the country.  However, Logan never credited Chipman or any of the others with originating the idea. Bellware and Gardiner credit Mary Ann Williams and the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia as the true originators of the holiday as abundant contemporaneous evidence from across the nation exists to substantiate the claim.

When Grant was elected president in 1868, Chipman was asked to be on the presidential inaugural committee. At the time, Chipman was living on the corner of First and B streets southeast. After Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, Chipman was appointed Secretary of the District of Columbia, effectively the second highest local official after the Governor of the District of Columbia. Chipman held this position for 50 days, until Edward L. Stanton was appointed to replace him. At the time, Chipman was living at 1725 G Street NW, and he had recently founded the law firm of Chipman, Hosmer &amp; Co., located at Sixth and F streets NW.

Chipman spoke at a Republican nominating convention on March 7, 1871, where he said, &quot;If there was anybody here who didn&#x27;t want his children placed in mixed schools he had better take them out of the District of Columbia.&quot; The statement was drawn out of Chipman after persistent questioning from someone in the crowd, and it caused quite a stir, considering that Republicans generally avoided committing on the subject of school integration in order to not alienate moderate white Republicans. Due to his friendship with Grant, name recognition, longer residency in the District, and his connection to the District&#x27;s government, the convention decided to nominate Chipman over Frederick Douglass to be the Republican nominee for the District of Columbia&#x27;s first delegate to Congress. While campaigning, Republicans advocated for long-time District resident Chipman over Democratic candidate Richard T. Merrick, who they said owned no property in the District. This argument backfired when it was revealed that Chipman had sold his home and was living at a hotel, while Merrick actually did own real estate in the District. During the April general election, Chipman won, receiving 15,196 votes to Merrick&#x27;s 11,104. Republicans won fifteen of the twenty-two members of the District&#x27;s House of Delegates as well.

Now living on B Street SE, Chipman spent much of his time in Congress advocating for the District&#x27;s public works program. Among the bills he submitted to Congress was a bill to appropriate 2,500,000 acres of land to build schools, a bill to appropriate $200,000 to complete construction of the Washington Monument, and a bill to build a new bridge over the Anacostia River, a bill to improve the Washington harbor. When Congressman Robert Roosevelt sharply criticized the District&#x27;s board of public works, calling it rife with fraud and corruption, Chipman fiercely defended the board, saying Roosevelt&#x27;s charges were based on willful misinformation and false accounts.

Running for reelection in 1873, he defeated Democrat L.G. Hine, formerly of the District&#x27;s Board of Aldermen, receiving 12,443 votes to Hine&#x27;s 7,042.

In 1874, Chipman submitted a bill to annex Georgetown to the City of Washington and to rename its streets to conform to Washington&#x27;s street-naming conventions. He also tried to require the federal government to pay the District government property tax for the federal buildings located in the District.

In 1875, Congress disestablished the District&#x27;s territorial government including Chipman&#x27;s position of delegate.

===Later years===
Chipman moved to Red Bluff, California in 1876, where he served as a member of the California State Board of Trade, eventually becoming its president. He served as a supreme court commissioner in California from 1897 to 1905. Finally, he was appointed by California&#x27;s governor George Pardee as the first presiding justice of the newly created California Third District Court of Appeal, a position he held from 1906 until 1921, when he resigned due to failing health.

He died on February 1, 1924, in San Francisco at the age of 89. He is interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. A small memorial remains in the library of the California Third District Court of Appeal in Sacramento. Chipman is the second longest-serving presiding justice of the court. In April 2006, the Federalist Society of Chipman&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Cincinnati College of Law, officially honored Chipman, renaming its local chapter the &quot;Norton Parker Chipman Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies at the University of Cincinnati College of Law.&quot;

==Personal life==
Chipman married Mary Isabel Holmes (1846-1919) in 1865 while stationed in St. Louis, Missouri. They had two children: Robert Holmes (1865-1866) and Alice Helen.

==Quotes==


==In popular culture==
The story of the Andersonville trial and Chipman&#x27;s role in bringing Wirz to justice inspired the Emmy Award-winning film &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot; (1970), directed by George C. Scott. In the film, William Shatner played the protagonist Chipman (Scott had played the role in the original Broadway production), Richard Basehart played Wirz, and Martin Sheen played a minor supporting role.

<text>Walter Edward Fauntroy Jr. (born February 6, 1933) is an American pastor, civil rights activist, and politician who was the Washington, D.C. delegate to the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1991. He was a candidate for the 1972 and 1976 Democratic presidential nominations as a favorite son.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
The fourth of seven children, Walter Fauntroy was born and raised in Washington, D.C.. His mother, Ethel (Vines) Fauntroy, was a homemaker. His father, William Thomas Fauntroy Sr., was a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office. Walter grew up in the Shaw community in Northwest Washington, and attended the New Bethel Baptist Church just a few blocks from his home.

He graduated second in his class at Washington&#x27;s all-black Dunbar High School in 1951, and the members of his church held fund-raising dinners to provide him with a college scholarship. When he graduated from Dunbar in 1952, his church gave him enough money to pay for his first year at Virginia Union University in Richmond. He pledged Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity while at Virginia Union, where he graduated with honors in 1955, and then earned a B.Div. from Yale Divinity School in 1958.

===Civil rights leader===
During his stay at Virginia Union University, Fauntroy met the 22-year-old Martin Luther King Jr., himself an ordained Baptist minister. With much in common, the two men formed a friendship that began with an all-night discussion of theology. Fauntroy joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and upon his return to Washington, D.C., became an influential lobbyist for civil rights in Congress. Fauntroy also helped to coordinate the 1963 March on Washington at which King gave his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Fauntroy and King watched President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1963 address on civil rights. After the speech, King jumped up and declared, &quot;Walter, can you believe that white man not only stepped up to the plate, he hit it over the fence!&quot;

After completing his education, Fauntroy became pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church. He returned home with an unorthodox view of Christian service that his parishioners immediately embraced. Believing that religion was something more than a Sunday morning ritual, Fauntroy took part in civil rights demonstrations, sit-ins, and marches – both in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere.

As director of the Washington Bureau of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Fauntroy served as D.C. Coordinator of the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, and a coordinator for the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches and the 1966 March Against Fear. President Lyndon Johnson appointed him Vice Chairman of the White House Conference on Civil Rights in 1966 and Vice Chairman of the D.C. City Council in 1967.

Fauntroy also founded and led the Model Inner City Community Organization (MICCO). This organization, which Fauntroy headed until 1971, used federal grants to improve inner city neighborhoods using black architects, city planners, and construction engineers to design and build homes, schools, stores, and other projects in urban Washington. At one time the budget for MICCO was well over $30 million, a community planning and neighborhood development group in Washington, D.C., that established and began to implement the Shaw Urban Renewal Project.

Fauntroy played a key role after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., meeting both with President Johnson and with activist Stokely Carmichael during the immediate aftermath. Fauntroy urged people, in person, on TV, and over radio, to adhere to King&#x27;s policy of nonviolence. He also led a prayer at King&#x27;s funeral.

Because his religious beliefs placed a premium on community service, Fauntroy gravitated toward the political arena. In 1967, he was named vice-chairperson of the Washington City Council, a nine-member body appointed directly by the president of the United States. Fauntroy sat on the city council for two years, resigning when his commitments as director of MICCO began to take all of his time.

Belying his previous ecumenicism, Fauntroy asked the United States Supreme Court to stop same-sex marriage from taking place in the District of Columbia in March 2010, pending a &quot;vote by the people&quot;.

===Congressional career===
The District of Columbia had no formal representation in Congress before 1970. That year, President Nixon signed the District of Columbia Delegate Act that gave the District one non-voting delegate to Congress. Fauntroy wanted the job. With the support of his fellow pastors in the city – and with appearances by his friend Coretta Scott King — he defeated two primary opponents who had both spent twice as much money as he did. Having won the primary by a substantial margin, Fauntroy easily beat Republican John A. Nevius and other candidates, including future D.C. council members Julius Hobson of the D.C. Statehood Party and Douglas E. Moore, who ran as an independent. Fauntroy was sworn in March 23, 1971, becoming the first delegate to represent the citizens of the District of Columbia as a member of the United States House of Representatives in almost 100 years.

Although Fauntroy&#x27;s status in the Congress did not allow him to vote on the House floor, he was allowed a vote in committee and could introduce legislation on any issue. Fauntroy therefore became influential with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) as a liberal with an agenda that included the concerns of inner city residents, the poor, and minorities. Fauntroy&#x27;s special quest was for home rule – and eventually statehood – for the District of Columbia. Using his considerable political clout, he oversaw legislation that provided for direct election of a mayor and a city council in Washington by 1973. Fauntroy briefly considered running for mayor of Washington himself but instead decided to stay in Congress. He was returned to his office five times over the ensuing years, sometimes with as much as 85 percent of the vote.

In Congress, he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He chaired the Caucus in 1981 and led the organization in presenting, for the first time, a budget to be debated by the House. The &quot;Constructive Alternative Budget&quot; was debated on the House floor for two days. He was a member of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, Congressman Fauntroy chaired for six years the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and for four years chaired the Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Monetary Policy. He also chaired, for fifteen years, the Bipartisan/Bicameral Task Force on Haiti.

Fauntroy authored the Black Leadership Family Plan For the Unity, Survival and Progress of Black People in 1982. The booklet laid out a strategy for Black social, political, and economic development. On Thanksgiving Eve in 1984, Fauntroy along with Randall Robinson and Mary Francis Berry launched the Free South Africa Movement which included their arrest for a sit in at the South African Embassy in Washington, D.C.

===Presidential campaigns as favorite son===
During the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries, Fauntroy campaigned in the D.C. primary as a favorite son candidate and won the largely uncontested event with 21,217 (71.78%) votes against 8,343 (28.22%) for unpledged delegates.

In the 1976 Democratic presidential primaries, he again participated in the D.C. primary, this time losing to eventual nominee Jimmy Carter; he placed second overall according to some measurements, but received zero delegates at the Democratic convention.

===Post-congressional career===

Fauntroy stepped down from his seat in Congress in 1990 to run for mayor of Washington, D.C.. He was defeated by Sharon Pratt Kelly, finishing in fifth with 7%. He told the &quot;Washington Post&quot;: &quot;I put together a very careful and thorough plan, but unfortunately that never got over. But I believe that all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord.&quot; Indeed, Fauntroy returned to the New Bethel Baptist Church, where he resumed a full-time ministry and rededicated himself to community service.

Fauntroy also founded Walter E. Fauntroy &amp; Associates, a consulting firm that provides lobbying services for a variety of clients. The first and biggest client to sign on with Fauntroy was Nelson Mandela&#x27;s African National Congress (ANC). Since 1992, Fauntroy has been lobbying Congress to pass legislation to create an &quot;enterprise fund&quot; for South Africa. He has been actively encouraging new private U.S. investment in South Africa as well. &quot;I&#x27;m having a great time,&quot; Fauntroy told the &quot;Washington Post &quot; from his new offices on Connecticut Avenue. &quot;The chances are very slim that I would run for local office in the District.&quot;

He is president of the National Black Leadership Roundtable (NBLR), the national network vehicle of the Congressional Black Caucus that he founded in 1977. In that capacity, as a part of the NBLR&#x27;s Seven Point Program, he is co-chair of the Sudan Campaign, chairman of the Business Enterprise Development, LLC and currently heads up a U.S.-based private sector effort to cure extreme poverty in Africa by the year 2025 in pursuit of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The drive is undertaken by the Roundtable in partnership with the Zimbabwe Progress Fund (ZPF) and is known as the Millennium Villages Project. Its focus is upon villages in sub-Saharan Africa.

In 2005, along with fellow former African-American Democratic congressman, the Reverend Floyd Flake, he joined with U.S. Representative Walter Jones (R-NC) to support the Houses of Worship Freedom of Speech Restoration Act (H.R. 235), which would have allowed tax-exempt religious institutions to engage more directly in current politics.

Robust and athletic through most of his life, Fauntroy was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1993, treated, and cured. He took his condition public to demystify the illness and to assure those who might be afflicted by it that they could be cured. He and his wife, Dorothy, also adopted an abandoned baby whom they named Melissa Alice.

According to an April 25, 2015 Washington Post story, Fauntroy had been out of the country since 2012, and his exact whereabouts were unknown, even to his wife and family. He occasionally phoned from a Dubai number to briefly check on people. But he gave no information on his location or exact details on his current life. On June 23, 2016, the Washington Post reported that U.S. officials had contacted Fauntroy in Ajman, United Arab Emirates and provided assistance in arranging his return to the United States, which was expected to occur in late June or early July 2016. He returned on June 27, 2016, and was arrested at Dulles International Airport on charges related to check fraud. He was released the next day. In September 2016, the bad check charge was dropped once Fauntroy paid back $20,000.

In 2018, his financial problems placed him in danger of losing his home.

==Criticism==

===Legal problems===
In 1995, Fauntroy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of filing a false disclosure statement in 1989. He had falsely reported making a $23,887 donation to a Washington church at the end of 1988.

In 2012, Fauntroy disappeared and presumably fled the United States after a bench warrant was issued for his arrest in conjunction with allegations he had written a fraudulent check for $55,000. Fauntroy&#x27;s wife was eventually forced to file for bankruptcy. While his whereabouts were initially unknown to even his family, it was assumed Fauntroy was living somewhere in the Persian Gulf. In 2016, Fauntroy returned to the United States and was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport. He had been hiding in Ajman, the capital of the Emirate of Ajman in the United Arab Emirates.

===Opposition to gay marriage===
Despite his prominent role in the civil rights movement, Fauntroy had publicly opposed gay rights for some time. In 1983, he acted to bar LGBT inclusion in the program of Washington&#x27;s 20th anniversary observance of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s 1963 March on Washington, although the chief organizer of that march, longtime civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, was an openly gay man.

Fauntroy has been criticized by supporters of gay rights for his support in 2001 of the Federal Marriage Amendment.

In January 2007, Fauntroy was asked to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Eugene, Oregon. The city&#x27;s human rights commission, knowing Fauntroy was against gay marriage, decided to withdraw from the event, which caused a firestorm of criticism. Ultimately, the commission rejoined the event.

In 2009, Fauntroy, along with six other pastors from Maryland and Washington, D.C., filed suit in D.C. Superior Court attempting to force a referendum to keep the District from recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages. The D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics had blocked the referendum because it is illegal to put on the ballot a referendum on any issue covered by the Human Rights Act.

===Opposition to the Tea Party Movement===
Fauntroy viewed the grassroots conservative Tea Party movement as a racist political group. In an August 26, 2010 article by ABC, Fauntroy said, &quot;We are going to take on the barbarism of war, the decadence of racism, and the scourge of poverty, that the Ku Klux – I meant to say the Tea Party,&quot; Fauntroy told a news conference today at the National Press Club. &quot;You all forgive me, but I – you have to use them interchangeably.&quot;

===2011 Libyan civil war===
Fauntroy visited Libya on a &quot;peace mission&quot; during the 2011 Libyan civil war. He remained there through the invasion of Tripoli, amongst the journalists holed up at the Rixos Al Nasr, where all Western media was based; this fact was confirmed by CNN reporter Matthew Chance on August 23, 2011, who noted on Twitter that Fauntroy was among the journalists being held within the hotel. He was released with the rest of the foreign nationals on August 25, 2011, and returned to Washington, where he took part in remembrances of the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.

In an interview with &quot;The Afro&quot; in early September 2011, Fauntroy claimed to have witnessed Danish and French special forces soldiers on the ground in Libya, beheading and maiming civilians and rebels alike and placing responsibility for the violence on the Libyans. He also said he believed &quot;more than 90 percent of the Libyan people love [Muammar] Gaddafi&quot;, the Libyan strongman opposed by the rebel movement. He defended Gaddafi and condemned his opponents, including NATO, saying, &quot;We believe the true mission of the attacks on Gaddafi is to prevent all efforts by African leaders to stop the recolonization of Africa.&quot; &quot;The Afro&quot; noted that it was unable to confirm any aspects of Fauntroy&#x27;s story, and there has been no independent corroboration of his claims.

==Personal life==
Fauntroy was married to the former Dorothy Simms of Petersburg, Virginia. She died in June 2023. Together they have two children: Marvin Keith and Melissa Alice.

==Awards and honors==
In recognition of Fauntroy&#x27;s humanitarian service, both his alma maters, Virginia Union University and Yale University, have conferred honorary Doctor of Law Degrees on him. He also holds honorary degrees from Howard University and Georgetown University Law Center.

The National Urban Coalition honored Fauntroy with its Hubert H. Humphrey Humanitarian Award in 1984.

<text>Eleanor Holmes Norton (born June 13, 1937) is an American politician, lawyer, and human rights activist. Norton is a congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she has represented the District of Columbia since 1991 as a member of the Democratic Party.

Prior to serving in Congress, Norton organized for Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement. From 1977 to 1981, she was the first female chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

She is also currently a part of the Democratic Congressional Progressive Caucus.

== Early life and education ==
Norton was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Vela (&quot;née&quot; Lynch), a schoolteacher, and Coleman Holmes, a civil servant. She attended Dunbar High School, a school famous for educating black children, as a member of its last segregated class. She was elected the junior class president and graduated as a member of the National Honor Society. She attended Antioch College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1960, then Yale University, where she received a Master of Arts in American studies in 1963 and a Bachelor of Laws from Yale Law School in 1964.

While in college and graduate school, Norton was active in the civil rights movement and an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). By the time she graduated from Antioch, she had already been arrested for organizing and participating in sit-ins in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Ohio. While in law school, she traveled to Mississippi for the Mississippi Freedom Summer and worked with civil rights stalwarts such as Medgar Evers. Her first encounter with a recently released but physically beaten Fannie Lou Hamer forced her to bear witness to the intensity of violence and Jim Crow repression in the South.

Norton&#x27;s time with the SNCC inspired her lifelong commitment to social activism and her sense of feminism. She contributed the piece &quot;For Sadie and Maud&quot; to the 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan. Norton was on the founding advisory board of the &quot;Women&#x27;s Rights Law Reporter&quot; (founded 1970), the first legal periodical in the United States to focus exclusively on the field of women&#x27;s rights law. In the early 1970s, Norton was a signer of the &quot;Black Woman&#x27;s Manifesto&quot;, a classic document of the Black feminist movement.

== Career before Congress ==

Upon graduation from law school, she worked as a law clerk to Federal District Court Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. In 1965, she became the assistant legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, a position she held until 1970. In 1970, Norton represented sixty female employees of &quot;Newsweek&quot; who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that &quot;Newsweek&quot; had a policy of allowing only men to be reporters. The women won, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; agreed to allow women to be reporters.

Norton specialized in freedom of speech cases, and her work included successfully arguing &quot;Carroll v. President &amp; Commissioners of Princess Anne&quot;, a Supreme Court case brought on behalf of the white supremacist National States&#x27; Rights Party. She put this victory into perspective in an interview with one of the District of Columbia Bar&#x27;s website editors: &quot;I defended the First Amendment, and you seldom get to defend the First Amendment by defending people you like ... You don&#x27;t know whether the First Amendment is alive and well until it is tested by people with despicable ideas. And I loved the idea of looking a racist in the face—remember this was a time when racism was much more alive and well than it is today—and saying, &#x27;I am your lawyer, sir, what are you going to do about that? She worked as an adjunct assistant professor at New York University Law School from 1970 to 1971. In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay appointed her as the head of the New York City Human Rights Commission, and she held the first hearings in the country on discrimination against women. Prominent feminists from throughout the country came to New York City to testify, while Norton used the platform as a means of raising public awareness about the application of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to women and sex discrimination.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Norton as the chair of the EEOC in 1977; she became the first female head of the agency. Norton released the EEOC&#x27;s first set of regulations outlining what constituted sexual harassment and declaring that sexual harassment was indeed a form of sexual discrimination that violated federal civil rights laws.

She has also served as a senior fellow of the Urban Institute. Norton became a professor at Georgetown University Law Center in 1982. During this time, she was a vocal anti-apartheid activist in the U.S., and was a part of the Free South Africa Movement.

In 1990, Norton, along with 15 other African American women and one man, formed African-American Women for Reproductive Freedom.

She contributed the piece &quot;Notes of a Feminist Long Distance Runner&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

She received a Foremother Award for her lifetime of accomplishments from the National Research Center for Women &amp; Families in 2011.

== Delegate to Congress ==

Norton was elected in 1990 as a Democratic delegate to the House of Representatives. She defeated city council member Betty Ann Kane in the primary despite the last-minute revelation that Norton and her husband, both lawyers, had failed to file D.C. income tax returns between 1982 and 1989. The Nortons paid over $80,000 in back taxes and fines. Her campaign manager was Donna Brazile. The delegate position was open because Del. Walter Fauntroy was running for mayor rather than seeking reelection. Norton received 39 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary election, and 59 percent of the vote in the general election. Norton took office on January 3, 1991, and has been reelected every two years since.

Delegates to Congress are entitled to sit in the House of Representatives and vote in committee, and to offer amendments in the Committee of the Whole, but are not allowed to take part in legislative floor votes. The district and four U.S. territories—Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—send delegates to Congress; the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico has the same rights as delegates.

William Thomas and the White House Peace Vigil inspired Norton to introduce the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act, which would require the United States to disable and dismantle its nuclear weapons at such time as all other nations possessing nuclear weapons do likewise. Norton has been introducing a version of the bill since 1994.

Legislation strongly supported by Norton that would grant the District of Columbia a voting representative in the House, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, was passed by the United States Senate on February 26, 2009. However, the legislation stalled in the House and failed to pass prior to the end of the 111th Congress.

The legislation proposed in 2009 did not grant Norton the right to vote in the 111th Congress, as she would have had to remain in her elected office of delegate for the duration of her two-year term.

In September 2010, the national press criticized Norton after the release of a voice message in which she solicited campaign funds from a lobbyist representing a project that she oversaw. Norton countered that the message was typical of appeals made by all members of Congress and that the call was made from campaign offices not paid for by taxpayers. In March 2012, the public radio series &quot;This American Life&quot; featured the voicemail message at the start of a program on lobbying titled &quot;Take the Money and Run for Office&quot;.

In May 2012, Norton was blocked from testifying on an anti-abortion bill in her district—the second time she has been blocked from speaking about abortion. She insisted that it was a denial of a common courtesy. Representative Jerrold Nadler supported Norton&#x27;s protest, saying &quot;Never in my 20 years as a member of Congress have I seen a colleague treated so contemptuously.&quot;

In August 2014, after the D.C. Board of Elections voted to put a question about marijuana legalization on the ballot in November 2014, Norton vowed to defend against any congressional attempt to stop the district from voting on the issue and to, if approved, fight any attempt to prevent implementation.

She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus.

*On June 23, 2020, Norton announced plans to introduce legislation to remove the Emancipation Memorial. (The wages of formerly enslaved people funded the Emancipation Memorial statue.) That same day, protesters on site vowed to dismantle the statue on Thursday, June 25, at 7:00 p.m. local time. A barrier fence was installed around the memorial to protect it from vandalism, which was later removed. Norton reintroduced her bill on February 18, 2021.

=== Legislation supported ===
*Norton supported the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (S. 994; 113th Congress), a bill that would make information on federal expenditures more easily accessible and transparent.

Norton said that the bill &quot;will improve the quality of data that agencies make available about their spending.&quot;
*Norton supported the bill &quot;To amend the Act entitled An Act to regulate the height of buildings in the District of Columbia to clarify the rules of the District of Columbia regarding human occupancy of penthouses above the top story of the building upon which the penthouse is placed&quot; (). The bill would increase the height limit of penthouses in D.C. to 20 feet, allowing for human occupancy. Norton said that &quot;this bill is not a mandate directing the city to make any changes to penthouses or to its existing comprehensive plan or local zoning laws more generally.&quot;

== Appearances ==

On July 27, 2006, Norton appeared on the &quot;Better Know a District&quot; segment of Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, in which she spiritedly defended the District of Columbia&#x27;s claim to being a part of the United States. She also appeared on the joint &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;/&quot;The Daily Show&quot; &quot;Midterm Midtacular&quot; special on November 7, 2006. Norton gave further interviews to Stephen Colbert on March 22, 2007, and April 24, 2007, on the subject of representation in the District of Columbia. On February 12, 2008, Colbert and Norton discussed her status as a superdelegate as well as her support of Barack Obama for president. She appeared once again on February 11, 2009, to discuss D.C. representation and promised Colbert that she would make him an honorary citizen of Washington, D.C., and give him a key to the city, if D.C. citizens were given representation. Colbert in turn gave Norton a &quot;TV promise&quot; that he would be there should that happen. Norton made a further appearance on Colbert&#x27;s show on June 25, 2014, where she discussed the impact that African-American Democrats had on incumbent Thad Cochran&#x27;s primary defeat of Chris McDaniel, a Tea Party candidate, as well as Colbert&#x27;s final episode among a cadre of past guests.

On June 27, 2008, Norton appeared on &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; to discuss the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, which she strongly opposed. On December 5, 2014, Norton appeared on &quot;Hannity&quot; to discuss the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on which she admitted she did not read the evidence of the case, but criticized the racial profiling of young African Americans.

== Legislation regarding NFL tax-exempt status ==
On October 2, 2014, ABC News reported that Norton, discussing her co-sponsorship of a bill aimed at changing the National Football League&#x27;s tax-exempt status, stated: &quot;The NFL greed is so widespread that they&#x27;ve chosen to operate as a tax-exempt organization. So we want to take that choice away from them unless, and until, they decide not to profit from a name that has now officially been declared a racial slur.&quot; In essence, Norton&#x27;s position was that until the NFL forced the Washington Redskins owner (Daniel Marc Snyder) to change the team name she would support legislation that would change the NFL&#x27;s tax status thereby costing the league money.

<text>Tsarigrad or Tsargorod, also &quot;Czargrad&quot; and &quot;Tzargrad&quot;, is a Slavic name for the city or land of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul in Turkey), the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

== Variations ==
The terms &quot;Tsargrad&quot;, &quot;Tsarigrad&quot;, &quot;Tsargorod&quot;, etc. are rendered in several ways depending on the language, for instance:
* ;
* ; 
* South Slavic languages: &quot;Carigrad&quot; / &quot;Tsarigrad&quot; or Цариград, depending on their alphabets;
* ;

&quot;Tsargrad&quot; is an Old Church Slavonic translation of the Greek Βασιλὶς Πόλις. Combining the Slavonic words &quot;tsar&quot; for &quot;caesar / emperor&quot; and &quot;grad&quot; for &quot;city&quot;, it meant &quot;imperial city&quot;. According to Per Thomsen, the Old East Slavic form influenced an Old Norse appellation of Constantinople, &quot;Miklagard&quot; (Мikligarðr).

== Usage in Russian ==
In the Russian language, the term &quot;Tsargrad&quot; became an important piece of vocabulary in the political ideologies of Panslavists, Orthodox Christian fundamentalists, and early Russian nationalists. Constantinople/Tsargrad was the &quot;Second Rome&quot; in the line of thinking that made Moscow the &quot;Third Rome&quot;, thus giving the recapture of Constantinople by a majority-Christian country a potential proof of great power status for Russia.

The obsession by the Russian political elite with &quot;Tsargrad&quot; did not wane going into the fin de siècle period, and the capture of the city became an important Russian war goal in World War I (1914–1918). On the backdrop of the &quot;Straits Question&quot;, religious antipathy towards the majority-Muslim Ottoman Empire and the reputation of Constantinople as the capital city of the Eastern Orthodox Church combined with the geostrategic interest to secure the Bosporus and the Dardanelles and thus the security of Russia&#x27;s maritime route from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. This strategic interest did not always cleanly overlap with religious affiliations; when the Bulgarian army approached Constantinople during the First Balkan War (1912/13) in the hopes of capturing the city for majority-Orthodox Bulgaria, the Russian government pressured its Bulgarian counterpart to abstain from the conquest of the city. The Russian leadership had no interest in the potential prestige to be gained from control of Constantinople to pass to another Orthodox country besides Russia itself. During World War I, the Russian public remained positively predisposed towards a potential conquest of Constantinople by Russia; Maurice Paléologue noted his observation that the population of Petrograd was hesitant around 1915/16 to accept the prospect of an outcome of the war that would not yield the city&#x27;s conquest.

Though religious motives were less important to the leaders of the Soviet Union, the post-1917 government nonetheless inherited its predecessor&#x27;s strategic interests in the Turkish Straits, hoping to gain access to global maritime shipping routes.

In modern Russia, one namesake of Tsargrad is Tsargrad TV, a Russian television channel which supports the ruling party from a perspective of Orthodox religious conservatism.

== Usage in Bulgarian ==
Bulgarians also applied the word to Tarnovgrad (&quot;Tsarevgrad Tarnov&quot;, &quot;Imperial City of Tarnov&quot;), one of the capitals of the tsars of the Bulgarian Empire, but after the Balkans came under Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian word has been used exclusively as another name of Constantinople.

As the &quot;zeitgeist&quot; which spawned the term has faded, the word &quot;Tsargrad&quot; is now an archaic term in Russian. It is however still used occasionally in Bulgarian, particularly in a historical context. A major traffic artery in Bulgaria&#x27;s capital Sofia carries the name &quot;Tsarigradsko shose&quot; (&quot;Tsarigrad Road&quot;); the road begins as the Tsar Osvoboditel Boulevard and continues into the main highway that leads southeast to Istanbul. The name &quot;Tsarigrad&quot; is also retained in word groups such as &quot;tsarigradsko grozde&quot; (&quot;Tsarigrad grapes&quot;, meaning &quot;gooseberry&quot;), the dish &quot;tsarigradski kyuftentsa&quot; (&quot;small Tsarigrad koftas&quot;) or sayings like &quot;One can even get to Tsarigrad by asking&quot;. In Slovene it is still largely used and often preferred over the official name. People also understand and sometimes use the name &quot;Carigrad&quot; in Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.

== Non-Slavic usage ==
The Romance language Romanian borrowed the term as &quot;Țarigrad&quot;, due to the long tradition of Church Slavonic in Romania, but it is an archaic usage now that has been replaced by &quot;Constantinopol&quot; and &quot;Istanbul&quot;. Nowadays, a village in Moldova is called Țarigrad.

<text>The Malaysian Grand Prix (, officially the Malaysia Grand Prix from 1963–1965 and 2011–2017 and Malayan Grand Prix in 1962) was an annual auto race held in Malaysia. It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The Malaysian Grand Prix was held annually from 1962 to 1964 in Singapore, whilst it was a member of the Malaysian federation. Subsequent Grands Prix were held in Peninsular Malaysia.

==History==

=== Singapore and Shah Alam ===
From 1962 to 1965 an annual race weekend for motorcycles and Formula Libre cars was held at the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore, named the Malaysia Grand Prix. After Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 the event was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix and continued until 1973.

Between Singapore&#x27;s departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam&#x27;s own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969–1972), Formula Atlantic (1973–1975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978–1982) and Formula Brabham (1995).

=== Sepang International Circuit ===
As part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to the country&#x27;s other tracks, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.

The inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in , and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year&#x27;s British Grand Prix. Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated.

From 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner.

The 2001 event was hit by a heavy rainstorm in the middle of the race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so bad that the two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1–2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable.

On 8 April 2007, shortly before the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone was quoted as stating that the circuit was getting &quot;shabby&quot; and &quot;a bit tired&quot; from the lack of care, describing it as &quot;an old house that needs a bit of redecorating&quot;. He noted that the circuit itself is not the issue, but rather the surrounding environment; rubbish is said to be littered all over the place, potentially damaging the circuit&#x27;s good reputation when it was opened in 1999.

The day before, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had met Ecclestone to discuss an extension of the Formula One contract beyond 2010. While the government had been given an additional extension to host the Grand Prix until 2015, the government was still mulling the offer, as of 23 April 2007. The circuit was given a renewed contract in 2006 to organise the Malaysian Grand Prix for another five years.

On 13 February 2008, the management of the Sepang International Circuit announced its aim to become Formula One&#x27;s second night race from after Singapore, following discussions about buying a floodlighting system. Mokhzani Mahathir, the chairman of the circuit, was quoted as saying that the lights &quot;might be custom made for the circuit.&quot; However, the organisers ended up settling for a late-afternoon start time.

The 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was held around sunset, starting at 17:00 local time (09:00 UTC). This proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall. The race was red-flagged and ultimately not restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points. Later that night, Jamiroquai made an appearance in a concert for the weekend.

On 7 April 2017, it was announced that the 2017 race would be the swansong of the Malaysian Grand Prix. The race&#x27;s contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales. Malaysia&#x27;s youth and sports minister at the time Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter: &quot;I think we should stop hosting the F1. At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.&quot; The BBC reported that &quot;Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore.&quot;

<text>Madeleine Mary Zeien Bordallo (; born May 31, 1933) is an American-Guamanian politician who served as the delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives for from January 3, 2003, to January 3, 2019.

She is the first woman ever to serve as Guam&#x27;s Delegate, the first female lieutenant governor of Guam (from 1995 to 2003), the first female candidate for governor of Guam (in 1990), and the first female Democrat elected to the Legislature of Guam. Her 1990 campaign also made her the first non-Chamorro gubernatorial candidate in Guam. As the wife of Ricardo Bordallo, she was also the First Lady of Guam from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1987.

==Biography==

Madeleine Mary Zeien was born on May 31, 1933, in Graceville, Minnesota, to a family of educators who moved to Guam after her father took a job with the Guam Department of Education. She attended St. Mary&#x27;s College in Notre Dame, Indiana, and the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota, where she studied music. In the 1950s and 1960s, Bordallo was a television presenter for KUAM-TV, the NBC affiliate that was the first television station on Guam.

Bordallo was married to Ricardo Bordallo, who served as Governor of Guam from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1987. While serving as first lady, she worked to emphasize the arts in the classroom and to increase awareness of the local Chamorro culture. Bordallo&#x27;s husband, the former governor, committed suicide in 1990, when his appeals were unsuccessful and convictions of witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice would require incarceration in federal prison. Bordallo was the first female Democrat to be elected to the Guam Legislature, and she served five terms as a senator from 1981 to 1983 and again from 1987 to 1995. During the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Bordallo was a member of Guam&#x27;s uncommitted delegation to the 1988 Democratic National Convention. 
Bordallo was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Guam in 1990, following the death of her husband. Ping Duenas ran as Bordallo&#x27;s running mate for lieutenant governor in the 1990 gubernatorial election.

In 1994, she ran alongside Carl Gutierrez on the Democratic ticket and was elected lieutenant governor, serving from 1995 to 2003. She was the first woman in Guam&#x27;s history to hold this position. As lieutenant governor, she worked to promote tourism, environmentalism, and island beautification.

In 2002, Bordallo reached her term limit and, as Delegate Robert Underwood vacated his seat and attempted to run for governor, she campaigned for and was elected as a Democrat to the House, serving from January 2003 to January 2019. She was the first woman to represent Guam in Congress. She was one of six non-voting delegates to the House of Representatives. While in Congress, she devoted herself to economic issues and helped to pass legislation that aided small businesses on Guam. She also was involved in military and environmental issues.

In April 2008, Bordallo apologized after an investigative report by the &quot;Pacific Daily News&quot; revealed that she and Senator Jesse Lujan both claimed to have degrees on their official biographies and resumes when they had not graduated from college.

In August 2018, Bordallo lost her bid for renomination for another term as delegate in the Democratic primary to territorial senator Michael San Nicolas.

===Legislation===
Bordallo objected to amendments the United States Senate made to the Omnibus Territories Act of 2013. Originally, the bill would have included the provisions to create a fund in the U.S. treasury to pay reparation claims to &quot;living Guam residents who were raped, injured, interned, or subjected to forced labor or marches, or internment resulting from, or incident to, such occupation and subsequent liberation; and (2) survivors of compensable residents who died in war.&quot; This provision, however, was removed from the bill. Bordallo was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by this change and said that she was &quot;committed to continuing our fight for war claims for our manamko despite all the obstacles the conservative Republicans continue to raise.&quot; The changes were made so that the bill could pass by unanimous consent.

===Elections===
In January 2012, Republican Guam Senator Frank Blas Jr. announced he would challenge Bordallo in the upcoming November election for her delegate seat. Bordallo defeated Blas in the November general election. She received 19,765 votes (58%) to his 12,995 votes (38%)

In May 2012, Yale graduate and former White House intern Karlo Dizon, Democrat, also announced his bid as delegate to Congress. Bordallo defeated Dizon in the primary election, with 73% of the vote.

In 2014, she ran for delegate alongside Matthew Pascual Artero in the Democratic primary election. Bordallo defeated Artero in the primary election on August 30, 2014. Republican candidate Margaret McDonald Metcalfe announced that she would challenge Bordallo in the 2014 November election for her delegate seat.

In 2016, she was re-elected by the smallest margin, 53% to 47%, since she was first elected when she faced former Governor of Guam Felix Perez Camacho.

In the 2018 elections, Bordallo lost the Democratic primary to territorial Senator Michael San Nicolas for the delegate seat in the U.S. House of Representatives by 3.4%.

<text>Robert Anacletus Underwood (born July 13, 1948) is an American politician and educator who served as the delegate from Guam to the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2003 as a member of the Democratic Party. He subsequently served as the president of the University of Guam from 2008 to 2018 and is currently a co-chair of the United States Institute of Peace China-Freely Associated States Senior Study Group.

==Early life==
Underwood was born in Tamuning, Guam. He is the son of John Joseph Underwood (1911–1986) and Esther Flores Taitano (1913–2005). His paternal grandparents were James Holland Underwood and Ana Pangelinan Martinez, from Tamuning, Guam, and his maternal grandparents were Juan San Nicolas Taitano and Rosario Sablan Flores, who resided in Dededo, Guam. Underwood graduated from Guam&#x27;s John F. Kennedy High School in 1965, and attended California State University, Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. He became a high school teacher on the American mainland, and he then served as an instructor at the University of Guam from 1976 to 1983. Underwood was director of bilingual education assistance for Micronesia until 1988 and Academic Vice President of the University of Guam until 1992.

In 2009, he married former Guam Department of Education superintendent Dr. Nerissa Bretania Underwood during an intimate morning ceremony at the Superior Court of Guam. His wife is a former senator in Guam Legislature. Underwood is a regular opinion contributor in the &quot;Pacific Daily News&quot;.

==Guam Delegate (1993–2003)==

Underwood served as the Guam Delegate to the US Congress in the 103rd through 107th Congresses from January 3, 1993 to January 3, 2003 during which he sponsored major legislation for Guam, played an active role in US Department of Defense authorization bills and was an advocate for political development for insular areas and the extension of educational and social opportunities for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. During his tenure in congress, he became a senior member of both the House Armed Services and Resources committees. He emphasized the importance of Guam and the Asian Pacific region in national strategic policy and worked to enhance the benefits of military personnel, especially those in guard and reserve units.

He passed major legislation for Guam that resolved long standing land disputes with the federal government, brought recognition to Guam&#x27;s World War II generation and their case for war claims and enhanced local autonomy. Additionally, he built a successful record of bringing in federal funds for military construction, assistance to the government of Guam due to in-migration from surrounding islands and for several education programs.Underwood ensured Guam&#x27;s inclusion in major legislation such as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that brought domestic telephone rates to Pacific territories, the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program and the bill that established the Department of Homeland Security. He brought recognition to Guam&#x27;s unique people by lifting the ban on betel nut (pugua) importation into the US Customs Zone, inclusion in the National World War II Memorial, the creation of Chamorro Standard Time (CST) and participation in national commemorative events.

As a member of the Hispanic and Asian Pacific American Caucuses, he spoke out for the protection of immigrant rights, educational opportunities and sensitivity to language issues. As chairman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in the 106th Congress, he led the effort to include Asian Pacific Americans in scholarship programs, was instrumental in the development of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, spoke out against racial profiling and for including Pacific Islanders as a demographic category in federal programs.

==2002 gubernatorial campaign==

Underwood declared his candidacy for the 2002 gubernatorial election and was a candidate in the November 2002 General election. His running mate for Lt. Governor was Senator Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Ada. Underwood was defeated by Felix Perez Camacho in the general election on November 3, 2002.

==2006 gubernatorial campaign==

Underwood ran again as a Democrat for Governor of Guam in 2006, with running mate Frank Aguon for Lieutenant Governor. The Underwood-Aguon team faced former governor Carl Gutierrez and Senator Benjamin Cruz. He defeated his main Democratic rival, for the Gutierrez-Cruz team in the primary election on September 2, 2006. But on November 7, 2006 he was defeated during the general elections when incumbent Republican Governor Felix Perez Camacho, along with his new running mate Lt. Governor-elect Dr. Michael Cruz, was reelected with 50% to 48%.

==UOG president (2008–2018)==
In 2008, Underwood was selected to begin a 5-year term as the tenth president of the University of Guam and has continued to hold this position as of 2016. In June 2018, Underwood retired as President of the University of Guam and was succeeded by Thomas W. Krise.

== 2020 congressional election ==
On June 30, 2020, Underwood announced he was running for Guam Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives against incumbent Michael San Nicolas. In 2020, San Nicolas was re-elected. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Guam cancelled party primaries and all qualified candidates appeared on the November 3 general election ballot. San Nicolas came in first in a three-way race against Underwood and Republican territorial senator Wil Castro, but did not win an outright majority. In the November 17 runoff, San Nicolas defeated Underwood earning more than 59% of the vote.

<doc id="309605" wikidata="Q272580" url="?curid=309605" title="Juvénal Habyarimana">
<text>Juvénal Habyarimana (; ; 8 March 19376 April 1994) was a Rwandan politician and military officer who was the second president of Rwanda, from 1973 until his assassination in 1994. He was nicknamed &quot;Kinani&quot;, a Kinyarwanda word meaning &quot;invincible&quot;.

An ethnic Hutu, Habyarimana served in several security positions including minister of defense under Rwanda&#x27;s first president, Grégoire Kayibanda. After overthrowing Kayibanda in a coup in 1973, he became the country&#x27;s new president and eventually continued his predecessor&#x27;s pro-Hutu policies. He was a dictator, and electoral fraud was suspected for his unopposed re-elections: 98.99% of the vote on 24 December 1978, 99.97% of the vote on 19 December 1983, and 99.98% of the vote on 19 December 1988. During his rule, Rwanda became a totalitarian, one-party state in which his MRND-party enforcers required people to chant and dance in adulation of the president at mass pageants of political &quot;animation&quot;. While the country as a whole had become slightly less impoverished during Habyarimana&#x27;s tenure, the great majority of Rwandans remained in circumstances of extreme poverty.

In 1990, the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) launched the Rwandan Civil War against his government. After three years of war, Habyarimana signed the Arusha Accords in 1993 with the RPF as a peace agreement. The following year, he died under mysterious circumstances when his plane, also carrying the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, was shot down by a missile near Kigali. His assassination ignited ethnic tensions in the region and helped spark the genocide against the Tutsi.

== Early life and education ==
Juvénal Habyarimana was born on 8 March 1937, in Gisenyi, Ruanda-Urundi to a wealthy Hutu family. After receiving a primary education, he attended the College of Saint Paul in Bukavu, Belgian Congo, where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and humanities. In 1958 he enrolled in Lovanium University&#x27;s medical school in Léopoldville. After the beginning of the Rwandan Revolution the following year, Habyarimana left Lovanium and enrolled in the officer training school in Kigali. He graduated with distinction in 1961 and became an aide to the Belgian commander of the force in Rwanda. He married Agathe Kanziga in 1962.

On 29 June 1963 Habyarimana, as a lieutenant, was appointed head of the Garde Nationale Rwandaise. Two years later he was made Minister of the National Guard and Police.

== Presidency ==

On 5 July 1973, while serving as Army Chief of Staff and minister of defense, Habyarimana seized power in a coup d&#x27;état against the incumbent President Grégoire Kayibanda, ousting Kayibanda&#x27;s ruling Parmehutu party. In 1975, he created the &quot;Mouvement Révolutionnaire National pour le Développement&quot; as the country&#x27;s only legal party. The government stayed almost entirely in military hands until 1978 when a new constitution was approved in a referendum. At the same time, Habyarimana was elected to a five-year term as president; as president of the MRND, he was the only candidate. He was reelected in 1983 and 1988, both times as the only candidate.

A Hutu himself, he initially won favor among both Hutu and Tutsi groups given his administration&#x27;s reluctance to implement policies that catered to his primarily Hutu supporters. This restraint did not last and Habyarimana eventually began to oversee a government that mirrored the policies of Kayibanda. Quotas were once again applied to jobs for universities and government services which intentionally disadvantaged Tutsis. As Habyarimana continued to favor a smaller and smaller coterie of supporters, Hutu groups who felt slighted by him cooperated with Tutsis to weaken his leadership. By the start of the invasion from Uganda by the army of the Rwanda Patriotic Front, a rebel army made up mostly of refugee Tutsi who had helped Uganda&#x27;s Museveni seize control of the presidency, Habyarimana&#x27;s supporters had shrunk down to the akazu (&quot;little house&quot; or &quot;President&#x27;s household&quot;), which was mainly composed of an informal group of Hutu extremists from his home region, namely from the northwestern provinces of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.

From 1975 to 1990, the MRND and the Habyarimana government were one. Under a constitution adopted in 1978, every five years the president of the MRND, Hayarimana, was automatically elected to a five-year term as president of the republic, and was confirmed in office via a referendum. Every four years, voters had the option of choosing between two MRND candidates for the legislature. All citizens of Rwanda became members of the MRND at birth.

Local administrations simultaneously represented the official party as well as the local authority. Legal and party policies were communicated and enforced from the Head of State down through the local administrative units, especially the general policy of Umuganda, in which Rwandans were required to &quot;allocate half a day&#x27;s labour per week&quot; to infrastructural projects. Habyarimana is sometimes described as a moderate though the party is said to have used right-wing propaganda methods, advanced a conservative political agenda and was anti-communist. 

However, in 1990, before the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invasion, and because of mounting pressure from several sources—Rwanda&#x27;s main ally and financial backer, France, its main funders, the IMF and the World Bank, and from its own citizens wishing for a greater voice and economic change—he agreed to allow the formation of other parties such as the Republican Democratic Movement, the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party and the Christian Democratic Party.

=== Rwanda Civil War ===

In October 1990, an attack on Habyarimana&#x27;s government began when rebels from the RPF, a force of mostly Tutsi Rwandan refugees and expatriates who had served in the Ugandan army (many in key positions), crossed the border from Uganda. Habyarimana was in New York City attending the United Nations World Summit for Children when the attack commenced. When news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion. The French government responded by dispatching troops to his aid under the cover of protecting French nationals. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them within a week of their arrival.

With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Fred Rwigyema&#x27;s death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October, they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border. Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a &quot;rear command&quot; for the group in Kampala, and &quot;flagging off&quot; the invasion. The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.

On 4 August 1993 the Rwandan government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) signed the Arusha Accords to end the Rwandan Civil War. As stipulated by the agreement, the new transitional government was to be sworn in on 5 January 1994. Habyarimana was sworn in as interim President at the Parliament building, but then suddenly departed before calling up the new Prime Minister and cabinet to be inaugurated. Habyarimana returned that afternoon with a list of new cabinet members from Hutu extremist parties, who had not been agreed upon in the Arusha Accords, to be sworn in. Having not been formally invited for a second ceremony, Chief Justice Joseph Kavaruganda did not appear and the suggested ministers were not sworn in, infuriating Habyarimana.

== Death ==
On 6 April 1994, Habyarimana&#x27;s private Falcon 50 jet was shot down near Kigali International Airport, killing Habyarimana. Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, the Chief of Staff of the Rwandan military, and numerous others also died in the attack. The plane crashed on the grounds of the presidential residence.

The circumstances of the crash remain unclear. At the time, the Hutu Power media claimed the plane had been shot down on orders from RPF leader Paul Kagame. Others, including the RPF, accused militant Hutus from within Habyarimana&#x27;s party of orchestrating the crash to provoke anti-Tutsi outrage while simultaneously seizing power.

Since the aircraft had a French crew, a French investigation was conducted; in 2006 it concluded that Kagame was responsible for the killing and demanded that he be prosecuted. The response from Kagame, the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Rwanda since the genocide, was that the French were only trying to cover up their own part in the genocide that followed. A more recent French probe in a January 2012 report was falsely reported to exonerate the RPF. Members of Kagame&#x27;s inner circle have come out publicly stating that the attack was ordered by Kagame himself. These include his former Chief of Staff and Ambassador to the United States Theogene Rudasingwa, the former army chief and Ambassador to India General Kayumba Nyamwasa, the former secretary in the Ministry of Defense Major Jean-Marie Micombero and others.

== Aftermath ==
=== Fate of remains ===
Habyarimana&#x27;s body was identified lying in a flowerbed at about 21:30 on 6 April by the crash site. The corpses of the victims were taken into the presidential palace living room. Plans were initially made to take his body to the hospital, but the renewal of conflict made this difficult, and instead his corpse was stored in a freezer at a nearby army barracks. His family shortly thereafter fled to France, making no preparations for his burial. At some point following, Habyarimana&#x27;s remains were obtained by Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and kept in a private mausoleum in Gbadolite, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Mobutu promised Habyarimana&#x27;s family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On 12 May 1997, as Laurent-Désiré Kabila&#x27;s ADFL rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to Kinshasa, where they waited on the apron of N&#x27;djili Airport for three days. On 16 May, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire and the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Habyarimana&#x27;s remains were burned under the supervision of an Indian Hindu leader.

=== Political consequences ===

The death of Habyarimana ignited the genocide against the Tutsi by extremists from the majority Hutus, against Tutsis and those Hutus who had opposed the government in the past or who had supported the peace accords. Within 100 days, somewhere between 491,000 and 800,000 Rwandans were massacred.

==Family and personal life==

Habyarimana&#x27;s wife, Agathe Habyarimana, was evacuated by French troops shortly after his death. She has been described as having been extremely influential in Rwandan politics. She has been accused by Rwandan Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama of complicity in the genocide and was denied asylum in France on the basis of evidence of her complicity. She was arrested in March 2010 in the Paris region by the police executing a Rwandan-issued international arrest warrant. In September 2011, a French court denied Rwanda&#x27;s request for extradition of Agathe Habyarimana.

Habyarimana was a devout Catholic.

<text>Cyprien Ntaryamira (6 March 1955 – 6 April 1994) was a Burundian politician who served as President of Burundi from 5 February 1994 until his death two months later. A Hutu born in Burundi, Ntaryamira studied there before fleeing to Rwanda to avoid ethnic violence and complete his education. Active in a Burundian student movement, he cofounded the socialist Burundi Workers&#x27; Party and earned an agricultural degree. In 1983, he returned to Burundi and worked agricultural jobs, though he was briefly detained as a political prisoner. In 1986 he cofounded the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), and in 1993 FRODEBU won Burundi&#x27;s general elections. He subsequently became the Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry on 10 July, but in October Tutsi soldiers killed the president and other top officials in an attempted coup.

Ntaryamira survived the putsch and in January 1994 the National Assembly elected him to become the President of Burundi. After a prolonged constitutional dispute, he was inaugurated on 5 February, declaring that his top priorities would be restoring peace, promoting human rights, and resettling refugees. Throughout his tenure he unsuccessfully sought to mitigate ethnic conflict. He was killed on 6 April 1994 when the plane he was travelling in with Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down over Kigali.

==Early life==
Cyprien Ntaryamira was born on 6 March 1955 in the Mageyo Zone&#x27;s commune of Mubimbi, Bujumbura Rural Province, Ruanda-Urundi. Ethnically, he was Hutu and the sixth of eleven children in his family. He attended primary school in Rushubi before enrolling in the Collège du Saint-Ésprit in Bujumbura in 1968.

In 1972 a Hutu rebellion against the regime of Tutsi President Michel Micombero led to a wave of anti-Hutu genocidal repression inflicted by the Burundian Army. According to his cousin, François Ngeze, government administrator Basile Gateretse hid Ngeze and Ntaryamira in his home for two weeks. Once the authorities became suspicious, Gateretse arranged for the two of them to flee across the Ruzizi River into Zaire. Thousands of Hutus ultimately fled the country. Ntaryamira eventually went to Rwanda. He reentered school at Rilima College in Kigali Prefecture, studying there from 1973 to 1976. He subsequently attended the National University of Rwanda, earning a bachelor&#x27;s of science degree and a degree in agriculture engineering in 1976 and 1979, respectively. He married Sylvana Mpabwanayo in 1985 and had three children with her.

==Political career==
While abroad, Ntaryamira maintained an interest in Burundian politics and in 1976 cofounded a student movement, known as the Movement of Progressive Barundi Students (&quot;Mouvement des Etudiants Progressistes Barundi&quot;). He served as head of its information department. In August 1979, some of the student movement members founded the Burundi Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Umugambwe wa&#x27;Bakozi Uburundi&quot;, UBU), a revolutionary socialist political party. By 1981 he sat on its central committee as its national secretary responsible for economic and social questions. He returned to Burundi in March 1983 and was hired as an advisor in the Burundian General Directorate of Agricultural Planning. He also established a hen-breeding business in Mubimbi. The following January he took charge of the Compagnie de Gérance du Coton&#x27;s northern cotton region. In May 1985 he was arrested and held at Mpimba prison for working with a subversive political movement—UBU. Incarcerated for a year, he was reportedly freed at the request of the wife of President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, a childhood friend of his.
As the Cold War wound down Ntaryamira, Melchior Ndadaye, and several other UBU members sought to move away from socialist ideology in favor of embracing democracy and electoral processes, as was more acceptable to the international community. Ntaryamira was viewed as politically moderate with regards to ethnic issues, believing Hutus could work with the Tutsi minority to govern Burundi. In August 1986 Ntaryamira, Ndadaye, and 10 others founded the Front for Democracy in Burundi (&quot;Front pour la Démocratie au Burundi&quot;, FRODEBU). Ntaryamira served in its political bureau and was responsible for creating the party&#x27;s economic policies. In December 1987 he was appointed Burundi&#x27;s Director General of Agriculture and Livestock. FRODEBU gained power after Burundi&#x27;s first democratic presidential and parliamentary elections, which ended a long history of rule by military officers of the Tutsi minority and the Union for National Progress (&quot;Union pour le Progrès national&quot;, UPRONA). Ndadaye became president. Ntaryamira was elected to a seat in the National Assembly, representing the Bujumbura Rural constituency. On 10 July 1993, he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, serving under Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi. In that capacity he appointed several Tutsis to key posts in the agriculture ministry.

At about midnight on 20/21 October 1993, members of the Burundian Army launched a coup attempt and attacked the presidential palace in an attempt to capture Ndadaye. The president&#x27;s wife called Ntaryamira to warn him of what was occurring. Fearing he would be targeted, Ntaryamira hid in his neighbours&#x27; home, who were Tutsis. When soldiers did not find him in his own residence, they went there asking for his whereabouts. The matriarch of the household told the soldiers that Ntaryamira had fled down the road, and they quickly departed. He then hid in a foreign embassy for the remainder of the coup attempt. Ndadaye and the other officials in the line of presidential succession—the President and Vice-President of the National Assembly—were ultimately killed, creating a power vacuum. The assassination also sparked massive violence, as Hutus massacred Tutsis in rural areas and the army retaliated by murdering Hutus, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and creating a large outflow of refugees.

On 9 January 1994, the National Assembly modified Article 85 of the Burundian constitution, empowering itself to elect the next president of Burundi. FRODEBU set about trying to name a successor to Ndadaye, and this stoked a rivalry between Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Léonard Nyangoma. By his own account, Ntibantunganya decided to withdraw himself as a candidate despite having the support of the central committee, citing his desire to focus on party matters, and Jean‐Marie Ngendahayo suggested that FRODEBU back Ntaryamira for the position instead. In contrast, former president Pierre Buyoya alleged that Ntaryamira was &quot;imposed&quot; by other FRODEBU figures and some party outsiders to circumvent the rivalry. The opposition viewed Ntaryamira as free of involvement in the 1993 massacres of Tutsis, and he was offered as a &quot;consensus&quot; candidate. On 13 January, the National Assembly elected Ntaryamira to become president in a vote, 78 to one. 

Ntaryamira was scheduled to be inaugurated on 22 January, but the parliamentary opposition, led by UPRONA, filed a suit with the Constitutional Court to block the installment. They argued that Article 182 of the constitution, which stipulated that the document could not be modified in times of national crisis, rendered the National Assembly&#x27;s amending of Article 85 void. FRODEBU parliamentarians argued that the change was necessary to fill the vacancy, since holding a national election to replace the former president would have been impossible. The Constitutional Court ruled in favor of the opposition in a decision split along ethnic lines. The Hutu justices subsequently resigned and the government dismissed the Tutsi justices. This led to several days of violence in Bujumbura, but on 3 February the government and opposition parties reached an agreement to install Ntaryamira as president with an UPRONA prime minister, as well as reinstate the Constitutional Court. Ntaryamira was sworn in on 5 February. In his inaugural address, he declared that his top priorities would be to restore peace, promote human rights, and resettle thousands of Burundian refugees and internally displaced persons. His government consisted of a broad coalition including Hutu and Tutsi members from FRODEBU and UPRONA. Anatole Kanyenkiko, an UPRONA politician, was made prime minister. Kanyenkiko&#x27;s selection did not satisfy many UPRONA leaders, and while Ntaryamira allowed several other top party figures into his government, he blocked the appointment of those whom he considered responsible for the violence in the capital.

During Ntaryamira&#x27;s presidency, Burundi was troubled with severe ethnic violence and an economic crisis triggered by the conflict and low rainfall. He reorganised the National Intelligence Service — appointing Domitien Ndayizeye to head it—and the Migration services and attempted to reform municipal police. He also announced that he would appoint a commission to investigate atrocities committed in Bujumbura. 

In an attempt to demobilise civilian militias, his government dispatched delegations to meet with the groups, but these entreaties failed as the emissaries were fired upon. His government then attempted to use the army to stop the militias, but in late March the army became entangled in ethnic conflict in the capital and, acting autonomously from the government, exclusively targeted Hutu neighborhoods for disarmament. In a radio broadcast, Ntaryamira appealed to the army to withdraw to end the fighting. His support for national disarmament and for a European embargo on arms exports to Burundi brought him into disagreement with Kanyenkiko, who wanted a harsh crackdown on rebel groups and thought an embargo infringed on the country&#x27;s sovereignty. Ultimately, his efforts to stem the ethnic violence were unsuccessful. He maintained close diplomatic ties with President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania. He was also rumoured to have daily phone conversations with Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana. On 4 April, he met with Mobutu and Habyarimana in Gbadolite to discuss regional security issues.

==Death==
=== Aircraft shootdown ===
On 6 April 1994 Ntaryamira attended a regional summit in Dar es Salaam called by Mwinyi to discuss maintaining peace in Burundi. However, the focus of the meeting quickly turned towards the implementation of the Arusha Accords, a peace agreement designed to end the Rwandan Civil War. The delegates chastised President Habyarimana for stalling the peace process, and Ntaryamira criticised him for heightening local tensions and thereby jeopardising the national security of Burundi. 

Once the summit was over, Ntaryamira reportedly asked Habyarimana if he could be taken home aboard the Rwandan Dassault Falcon 50 presidential jet, which was faster than his own propeller-driven plane. A stop in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, would also allow him to pick up his wife who was there. Habyarimana agreed and allowed Ntaryamira to accompany him along with two Burundian ministers. Some observers have speculated that Habyarimana feared he was in danger and thought that the presence of another head of state on his aircraft would deter attacks. At 8:23 PM as the jet was approaching Kigali International Airport, two surface-to-air rockets were fired, with the second missile striking it. The plane crashed, killing all aboard. The precise identity of the attackers who launched the rockets remains unknown. Some people believe Hutu extremists unhappy with Habyarimana&#x27;s decision to sign the Arusha Accords were responsible, while others have alleged that Rwandan rebel leader Paul Kagame ordered the assassination.

=== Political consequences ===

Observers feared that Ntaryamira&#x27;s death would lead to widespread violence in Burundi, as had happened when Ndadaye was killed in October 1993. However, unlike in Rwanda, where the shootdown sparked a genocide, the situation in Burundi remained peaceful after word was received of its president&#x27;s death. The Burundian government initially declared that the plane crash was caused by an accident and President of the National Assembly Sylvestre Ntibantunganya made a broadcast on television, flanked by the minister of defence and the army chief of staff, appealing for calm. Several hundred Tutsis marched through the capital to celebrate the deaths of the presidents. Diplomats reported that most Burundians believed that the assassination was meant to target Habyarimana, not Ntaryamira. 

Ntibantunganya attributed Ntaryamira&#x27;s death to &quot;the facts of circumstance&quot; and believed that he was not targeted. Ntibantunganya succeeded Ntaryamira as interim president. The Kanyenkiko government officially resigned but stayed in office to manage daily affairs pending the confirmation of its replacement. As Ntibantunganya was only viewed as having assumed the presidency in an interim fashion, new power sharing discussions between FRODEBU and the opposition parties began while ethnic tensions remained high and violence spread throughout the country. On 20 April the Constitutional Court again ruled that the amendment which allowed the National Assembly to elect Ntaryamira president was unconstitutional. An agreement was reached in September, whereby the National Assembly elected Ntibantunganya to a four-year term of office while 45% of positions in the cabinet were allocated to the opposition. Regardless, violence increased as the army purged Hutu civilians and numerous rebel groups formed to fight against it.

=== Burial and commemoration ===
Ntaryamira&#x27;s body was heavily mutilated in the crash; his corpse was identified at about 03:00 on 7 April 1994. On 16 April 1994, a requiem mass was held for him at the Regina Mundi Cathedral in Bujumbura, attended by thousands of people, and he was subsequently buried on the grounds of the presidential palace.

Historians Jean-Pierre Chrétien and Melchior Mukuri wrote of Ntaryamira&#x27;s presidency, &quot;It is difficult to draw up an assessment for a regime which only worked for two months and in an immediately very tense atmosphere.&quot; Ntaryamira&#x27;s death is commemorated annually by the Burundian government on 6 April. His killing in the plane shootdown has generally been overshadowed in public memory by Habyarimana&#x27;s death and the subsequent Rwandan genocide. On 6 April 2017, his widow wrote a letter to President Pierre Nkurunziza, asking that the Burundian government recognise Ntaryamira as a national hero and request that the United Nations launch an international investigation into the downing of his plane. In April 2021, a government spokesperson indicated that the government was considering its options for further exploring the details of the shootdown.

Won Pat completed his primary education at the Normal School in Hagåtña. He then became a teacher and after teaching for eight years , Won Pat was nominated to the advisory Guam Congress in 1936. Prior to the signing of the Organic Act in 1950 which provided for US citizenship and limited self-government, Guam&#x27;s citizens were under complete US Navy rule. The pre-Organic Act Guam Congress sat only as an advisory body to the naval governor. It consisted of two houses – the House of Council and the House of Assembly. Its members were elected by the people of their districts.

Following World War II, Won Pat began to attain influence on the island forming the Guam Commercial Corporation in 1946. Supported by the naval government, he prioritized economic self-sufficiency before achieving citizenship. GCC played a role in the post-war economic boom, but ultimately went bankrupt in 1954. By this time, Won Pat was entrenched in the House of Assembly beginning in 1948 becoming speaker of the Guam Legislature in 1951.

After World War II, the drive for American citizenship gained momentum from the Chamorros&#x27; loyalty to the United States during the Japanese occupation of Guam. After attaining the role of speaker in the Guam Congress, Won Pat along with naval Governor Carlton Skinner and Francisco B. Leon Guerrero, began work on what would become the Guam Organic Act. Gaining approval in Washington D.C., the act gave the people of Guam American citizenship and the right to establish a civil government.

==Guam Delegate (1965–1985)==

Guam took another step toward self-representation under Won Pat in 1964 when I Mina’ Siete na Liheslaturan Guåhan/the 7th Guam Legislature created Guam&#x27;s Washington Office as an elected position. Won Pat lobbied for the post and won it. While in office Won Pat spread awareness to the other state representatives about Guam and the political situation it was in, and increased federal support following his effective lobbying.

In his post in Washington, D.C., Won Pat continued the battle to gain representation in Congress and in the process gained many allies. These allies included California Congressman Philip Burton, a member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. Burton used his influence to gain the support of committee chairman Wayne Aspinall and twenty co-sponsors. Public Law 92-271 was passed on April 10, 1972. The groundbreaking bill gave Guam and the Virgin Islands representation in Congress for two-year terms. Elected officials could now speak on the House floor and introduce new legislation though they could not vote on the floor. On January 3, 1973, Won Pat became the first resident of Guam to take the oath of office as a member of the 93rd Congress.

While Won Pat was Guam&#x27;s delegate to the US Congress his efforts weren&#x27;t limited to his constituents on Guam. During his tenure as delegate to the U.S. Congress, he was instrumental in helping what are now the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; the Federated States of Micronesia, comprising the island states of Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk, and Yap; the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Palau achieved more political self governance through the dismantling of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

Shortly after World War II, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, not including Guam, was created and administered by the United States. In the 1970s work began to dissolve the Trust Territory as the districts voted to end their trustee status. The last district to gain political independence was Palau in 1994. The Northern Mariana Islands is now a US Commonwealth and its people US citizens. The Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau negotiated Compacts of Free Association with the United States. Consequently, Guam&#x27;s northern neighbors, all much more recent members of the American family, have the right to determine issues on a local level, including issues such as minimum wage and immigration, whereas the residents of Guam do not. He served six terms, until he was defeated for re-election in 1984 by Republican Ben Blaz.

==Personal life==
Won Pat was married to Ana Salas Perez (1912–1995) in 1932 and they had eight children: Aveline Ploke, Marilyn (1934–1990), Jacqueline Won Pat, Ellen Chargualaf, Anthony Won Pat, Rosalind Fleet, Mark Won Pat, and Judith Won Pat, who is the former Speaker of the Legislature of Guam (2008–2017).

==Retirement and death==
After his 1984 electoral defeat, Won Pat retired to Sinajana, Guam. He died in Silver Spring, Maryland, on May 1, 1987, of a heart attack. He is interred in the Veterans Cemetery, Piti, Guam.

==Honors==
In January 1989, the Guam International Air Terminal was officially named as Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in his honor.

<doc id="309616" wikidata="Q1017943" url="?curid=309616" title="Fareham">
<text>Fareham ( ) is a market town at the north-west tip of Portsmouth Harbour, between the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton in south east Hampshire, England. It gives its name to the Borough of Fareham. It was historically an important manufacturer of bricks, used to build the Royal Albert Hall, and grower of strawberries and other seasonal fruits. In 2011 it had a population of 42,210.

== History ==

The town has a documented history dating back to the Norman era, when a part of William&#x27;s army marched up from Fareham Creek before continuing to the Saxon capital of England, Winchester. Originally known as &quot;Ferneham&quot; (hence the name of the former entertainment venue Ferneham Hall, now Fareham Live), it was listed in the Domesday Book as having 90 households. The ford of Fareham Creek (at the top of Portsmouth Harbour) was the location of the Bishop of Winchester&#x27;s mills; the foundations were subsumed in the A27 near the railway viaduct. Commercial activity continued at the port until the 1970s and continues on a smaller scale.

In the 1960s Fareham experienced major residential development. By the 1970s the town had expanded to almost encompass the surrounding villages of Funtley, Titchfield, Catisfield and Portchester. In the late 1990s a settlement called Whiteley, straddling the boundaries of Fareham Borough and the City of Winchester, was developed to the north of Junction 9 of the M27 motorway. It is predominantly residential but includes the extensive Solent Business Park.

In 1995 Cams Hall, a derelict Palladian mansion, was restored for office use, and the surrounding Cams Estate was developed as a golf course and modern technology park.
Since 1997 Fareham has been the home of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre (ARCC), at the National Maritime Operations Centre (NMOC), and responsible for coordinating all Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters.

An urban renewal initiative began in 1999, renovating the town centre and historic buildings to include a new entertainment and shopping complex. It featured a major iron sculpture park installed in 2001 to celebrate the work of influential Lancastrian iron pioneer, Henry Cort, who lived in neighbouring Gosport but who had an iron rolling mill in Funtley (or Fontley), on the outskirts of Fareham.

==Arts and culture==

Fareham was home to Ferneham Hall, a multi purpose venue with a capacity of over 700. The hall opened in 1982 and closed in 2020 to allow for renovation. Work on the remodel began in 2022, including rebranding the centre to &quot;Fareham Live.&quot;

The Ashcroft Arts Centre, on Osborn Road, has a 150-seat theatre, a gallery, a dance/music studio and a fully licensed bar. It offers a varied programme of events including films, theatre, comedy and workshops.

The pedestrianised area of West Street, in the town centre, is home to a permanent exhibition of the work of 12 blacksmith artists celebrating the achievements of Henry Cort, the 18th century &#x27;man of iron&#x27; who pioneered the iron refining process at Funtley near Fareham. The puddled wrought iron sculptures are themed on Fareham&#x27;s market town history and the exhibition is the largest of its type in Britain.

== Education ==
In 2017 Fareham College was rated by OFSTED as &quot;Outstanding&quot;.

==Sport and Leisure==

Fareham has a Non-League football club, Fareham Town F.C.

== Transport ==

===Road===
The M27 motorway passes around the northern edge of the town, and is the main traffic artery into and out of the area. It provides rapid access to Portsmouth and Southampton, and from there to London via the M3 and A3(M).

The A27 was the original route along the south coast before the building of the M27, and runs from Brighton to Southampton, passing through the centre of Fareham. The A32 passes through Fareham at the Quay Street roundabout, a notorious bottleneck, on its way from Gosport to Wickham and through the Meon Valley to Alton.

Fareham was named the most car-dependent town in the UK by the Office for National Statistics in July 2014 with 538.7 cars registered to addresses in the town for every 1,000 residents.

===Rail===
Fareham railway station is on the West Coastway Line, with regular services to Portsmouth, Southampton, Brighton, Cardiff and London. Passenger services also ran south to Gosport until 1953, and north along the Meon Valley to Alton until 1955.

===Bus===
Bus transport in the town is provided by First Hampshire &amp; Dorset, which runs nearly all bus routes. Stagecoach South service 69 does run as far north as Winchester. The bus station is adjacent to Sacred Heart Catholic Church, and replaced an older station that was demolished in the late 1980s.

===Local government===
Fareham is a part of the slightly larger Borough of Fareham local government district, with some local services provided by a non-metropolitan district council called Fareham Borough Council. Following the most recent elections to the council, the council&#x27;s administration is currently made up of councillors from the Conservative Party which as of 2022 have a total of 12 councillors. The second largest party and therefore opposition on the council is the Liberal Democrats with 3 councillors.

Welborne is a proposed new town to the north of the M27 at Fareham, intended to include 6,000 houses with businesses and community facilities.

The Planning Inspectorate Hearings into Welborne took place in 2014. Building is yet to start, with the completion date for the first houses now scheduled for 2023/24. On 6 June 2022 the Planning Inspectorate reported back on its examination of the 2037 Fareham Local Plan, and in the post-hearing letter noted that they considered completion of the first Welborne houses by 2023/24 to be &quot;overly ambitious&quot; and that &quot;the site should be pushed back a year in the trajectory&quot;.

<doc id="309620" wikidata="Q409501" url="?curid=309620" title="Trisodium phosphate">
<text>Trisodium phosphate (TSP) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula . It is a white, granular or crystalline solid, highly soluble in water, producing an alkaline solution. TSP is used as a cleaning agent, builder, lubricant, food additive, stain remover, and degreaser.

As an item of commerce TSP is often partially hydrated and may range from anhydrous to the dodecahydrate . Most often it is found in white powder form. It can also be called trisodium orthophosphate or simply [[sodium phosphate]].

== Production ==
Trisodium phosphate is produced by neutralization of phosphoric acid using sodium carbonate, which produces disodium hydrogen phosphate. The disodium hydrogen phosphate is reacted with sodium hydroxide to form trisodium phosphate and water.
:

== Uses ==

=== Cleaning ===
Trisodium phosphate was at one time extensively used in formulations for a variety of consumer-grade soaps and detergents, and the most common use for trisodium phosphate has been in cleaning agents. The pH of a 1% solution is 12 (i.e., very basic), and the solution is sufficiently alkaline to saponify grease and oils. In combination with surfactants, TSP is an excellent agent for cleaning everything from laundry to concrete driveways. This versatility and low manufacturing price made TSP the basis for a plethora of cleaning products sold in the mid-20th century.

TSP is still sold and used as a cleaning agent, but since the late 1960s, its use has diminished in the United States and many other parts of the world because, like many phosphate-based cleaners, it is known to cause extensive eutrophication of lakes and rivers once it enters a water system.

Although it is still the active ingredient in some toilet bowl-cleaning tablets, TSP is generally not recommended for cleaning bathrooms because it can stain metal fixtures and can damage grout.

=== Chlorination ===
With the formula the material called chlorinated trisodium phosphate is used as a disinfectant and bleach, like sodium hypochlorite. It is prepared using NaOCl in place of some of the base to neutralize phosphoric acid.

=== Flux ===
In the U.S., trisodium phosphate is an approved flux for use in hard soldering joints in medical-grade copper plumbing. The flux is applied as a concentrated water solution and dissolves copper oxides at the temperature used in copper brazing. Residues are water-soluble and can be rinsed out before plumbing is put into service.

TSP is used as an ingredient in fluxes designed to deoxygenate nonferrous metals for casting. It can be used in ceramic production to lower the flow point of glazes.

=== Painting enhancement ===
TSP is still in common use for the cleaning, degreasing, and deglossing of walls prior to painting. TSP breaks the gloss of oil-based paints and opens the pores of latex-based paint, providing a surface better suited for the adhesion of the subsequent layer.

=== Food additive ===
Sodium phosphates including monosodium phosphate, disodium phosphate, and trisodium phosphate are approved as food additives in the EU. They are commonly used as acidity regulators and have the collective E number E339. The United States Food and Drug Administration lists sodium phosphates as generally recognized as safe.

=== Exercise performance enhancement ===
Trisodium phosphate has gained a following as a nutritional supplement that can improve certain parameters of exercise performance. The basis of this belief is the fact that phosphate is required for the energy-producing Krebs cycle central to aerobic metabolism. Phosphates are available from a number of other sources that are much milder than TSP.

== Regulation ==
In the Western world, phosphate usage has declined because of damage it causes to lakes and rivers through eutrophication.

=== Substitutes ===

By the end of the 20th century, many products that formerly contained TSP were manufactured with TSP substitutes, which consist mainly of sodium carbonate along with various admixtures of nonionic surfactants and a limited percentage of sodium phosphates.

Products sold as TSP substitutes, containing soda ash and zeolites, are promoted as direct substitutes. However, sodium carbonate is not as strongly basic as trisodium phosphate, making it less effective in demanding applications. Zeolites, which are clay based, are added to laundry detergents as water softening agents and are essentially non-polluting; however, zeolites do not dissolve and can deposit a fine, powdery residue in the wash tub. Cleaning products labeled as TSP may contain other ingredients, with perhaps less than 50% trisodium phosphate.

<doc id="309621" wikidata="Q1811707" url="?curid=309621" title="Lee Atwater">
<text>Harvey LeRoy &quot;Lee&quot; Atwater (February 27, 1951 – March 29, 1991) was an American political consultant and strategist for the Republican Party. He was an adviser to Republican U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush and chairman of the Republican National Committee. Atwater aroused controversy through his aggressive campaign tactics, especially the Southern strategy.

== Early life ==
Atwater was born on February 27, 1951, in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Alma &quot;Toddy&quot; (Page), a school teacher, and Harvey Dillard Atwater, an insurance adjustor. He had two siblings, Ann and Joe, and grew up in Aiken, South Carolina. When Lee was five, his three-year-old brother, Joe, died of third-degree burns when he pulled a deep fryer full of hot oil onto himself.

As a teenager in Columbia, South Carolina, Atwater played guitar in a rock band, The Upsetters Revue. Even at the height of his political power, he would often play concerts in clubs and church basements, solo or with B.B. King, in the Washington, D.C., area. He released an album called &quot;Red Hot &amp; Blue&quot; on Curb Records, featuring Carla Thomas, Isaac Hayes, Sam Moore, Chuck Jackson, and King. In the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; of April 5, 1990, Robert Hilburn wrote about the album: &quot;The most entertaining thing about this ensemble salute to spicy Memphis-style 1950s and 1960s R&amp;B is the way it lets you surprise your friends. Play a selection such as &#x27;Knock on Wood&#x27; or &#x27;Bad Boy&#x27; for someone without identifying the singer, then watch their eyes bulge when you reveal that it&#x27;s the controversial national chairman of the Republican Party, Lee Atwater.&quot; During the 1960s, Atwater briefly played backup guitar for Percy Sledge.

Atwater attended A.C. Flora High School. In 1973, Atwater graduated from Newberry College, a small private Lutheran institution in Newberry, South Carolina, where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and earned a bachelor of arts degree in history At Newberry, Atwater served as the governor of the South Carolina Student Legislature. He earned a Master of Arts degree in communications from the University of South Carolina in 1977.

== Political career ==
During the 1970s and the 1980 election, Atwater rose to prominence in the South Carolina Republican Party, actively participating in the campaigns of Governor Carroll Campbell and Senator Strom Thurmond. During his years in South Carolina, Atwater became well known for managing hard-edged campaigns based on emotional wedge issues.

=== 1980 and 1984 elections ===
Atwater&#x27;s aggressive tactics were first demonstrated during the 1980 Congressional campaigns. He was a campaign consultant to Republican incumbent Floyd Spence when he ran for Congress against Democratic nominee Tom Turnipseed. Atwater&#x27;s tactics in that campaign included push polling in the form of fake surveys by so-called independent pollsters, to inform white suburbanites that Turnipseed was a member of the NAACP. He also sent out last-minute letters from Senator Thurmond telling voters that Turnipseed would disarm the United States, and turn it over to liberals and Communists. At a press briefing, Atwater planted a fake reporter who rose and said, &quot;We understand that Turnipseed has had psychiatric treatment&quot;. Atwater later told reporters off the record that Turnipseed &quot;got hooked up to jumper cables&quot;, referring to electroconvulsive therapy that Turnipseed underwent as a teenager. Spence went on to win the race.

After the 1980 election, Atwater went to Washington and became an aide in the Ronald Reagan administration, working under political director Ed Rollins. In 1984, Rollins managed Reagan&#x27;s re-election campaign, and Atwater became the campaign&#x27;s deputy director and political director. Rollins mentioned Atwater&#x27;s work several times in his 1996 book &quot;Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms&quot;. He stated that Atwater ran a dirty tricks operation against Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, including publicizing the fact that Ferraro&#x27;s parents had been indicted for numbers running in the 1940s. Rollins described Atwater as &quot;ruthless&quot;, &quot;Ollie North in civilian clothes&quot;, and someone who &quot;just had to drive in one more stake&quot;.

The day after the 1984 presidential election, Atwater became a senior partner at the political consulting firm of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly.

During his years in Washington, Atwater became aligned with Vice President George H. W. Bush, who chose Atwater to manage his 1988 presidential campaign.

=== &quot;Southern strategy&quot; ===
As a member of the Reagan administration in 1981, Atwater gave an anonymous interview to political scientist Alexander P. Lamis. Part of the interview was printed in Lamis&#x27; book &quot;The Two-Party South&quot;, later reprinted in &quot;Southern Politics in the 1990s&quot; with Atwater&#x27;s name revealed. Bob Herbert reported on the interview in the October 6, 2005, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On November 13, 2012, &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine released a 42-minute audio recording of the interview. James Carter IV, grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, had asked and been granted access to the tapes by Lamis&#x27; widow. Early in the interview, Atwater argued that Reagan did not need to make racial appeals, suggesting that Reagan&#x27;s issues transcended the racial prism of the 1968 &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;:

&quot;Atwater:&quot; But Reagan did not have to do a southern strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I&#x27;ll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.
Later in the interview, Atwater was questioned about the implicitly racist aspects of the &quot;New Southern Strategy&quot; carried out by the Reagan campaign:

&quot;Atwater&quot;: As to the whole Southern strategy that Harry S. Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act would have been a central part of keeping the South. Now you don&#x27;t have to do that. All that you need to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he&#x27;s campaigned on since 1964, and that&#x27;s fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.

&quot;Questioner&quot;: But the fact is, isn&#x27;t it, that Reagan does get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps?

&quot;Atwater:&quot; Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, &quot;Nigger, nigger, nigger&quot;. By 1968, you can&#x27;t say &quot;nigger&quot;—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states&#x27; rights and all that stuff. You&#x27;re getting so abstract now [that] you&#x27;re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you&#x27;re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I&#x27;m not saying that. But I&#x27;m saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, &quot;We want to cut this&quot;, is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than &quot;Nigger, nigger&quot;. So, any way you look at it, race is coming on the back-burner.

=== 1988 election ===

Atwater&#x27;s most noteworthy campaign was the 1988 presidential election, when he served as campaign manager for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush.

Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis supported a felon furlough program originally begun in 1972, under Republican Governor Francis Sargent. In 1976, the Massachusetts legislature passed a measure to ban furloughs for first-degree murderers, but Governor Dukakis vetoed the bill. Soon afterward, Willie Horton, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder for stabbing a boy to death during a robbery, was released on weekend furlough, during which he kidnapped a young couple, tortured the man, and repeatedly raped the woman. Horton then became the centerpiece of Atwater&#x27;s ad campaign against Dukakis.

The issue of furlough for first-degree murderers was originally brought up by Democratic candidate Al Gore, during a presidential primary debate. However, Gore never referred specifically to Horton. Dukakis had tried to portray himself as a moderate politician from the liberal state of Massachusetts. The Horton ad campaign only reinforced the public&#x27;s general opinion that Dukakis was too liberal, which helped Bush overcome Dukakis&#x27; 17-percent lead in early public opinion polls, and win both the electoral and popular vote by landslide margins.

Although Atwater clearly approved of the use of the Willie Horton issue, the Bush campaign never ran any commercial with Horton&#x27;s picture, running a similar but generic ad instead. The original commercial was produced by Americans for Bush, an independent group managed by Larry McCarthy, and Republicans benefited from the coverage it attracted in the national media. Referring to Dukakis, Atwater declared that he would &quot;strip the bark off the little bastard&quot; and &quot;make Willie Horton his running mate&quot;. Atwater&#x27;s challenge was to counter the &quot;where was George?&quot; campaign slogan Democrats were using in an effort to create an impression that Bush was a relatively inexperienced and unaccomplished candidate. Furthermore, Bush faced criticism from the Republican base, who recalled his pro-choice positions from the 1980 primary. Additionally, it was believed that the harder the campaign attacked Dukakis&#x27;s liberal positions, the larger Dukakis&#x27;s base turnout would become.

During the election, a number of allegations were made in the media about Dukakis&#x27; personal life, including the unsubstantiated claim that his wife, Kitty, had burned a United States flag to protest the Vietnam War, and that Dukakis had been treated for a mental illness. In the film &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;, Robert Novak revealed that Atwater personally tried, but failed, to get him to spread these mental-health rumors.

The 1988 Bush campaign overcame a 17-point deficit in midsummer polls to win 40 states.

During the campaign, future President George W. Bush took an office across the hall from Atwater, where his job was to serve as his father&#x27;s eyes and ears. Bush wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I was an allegiance enforcer and a listening ear.&quot; In her memoir, Barbara Bush said Atwater and the younger Bush (whom Atwater called &quot;Junior&quot;) became &quot;great friends.&quot;

=== RNC Chairman ===
After the election, Atwater was named chairman of the Republican National Committee. Shortly after Atwater took over the RNC, Jim Wright, a Democrat, was forced to resign as Speaker of the House and was succeeded by fellow Democrat Tom Foley.

On the day that Foley officially became speaker, the RNC began circulating a memo to Republican congresspeople and state party chairpeople called &quot;Tom Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet&quot;. The memo compared Foley&#x27;s voting record with that of openly gay Congressman Barney Frank, with a subtle implication that Foley, too, was gay. It had been crafted by RNC communications director Mark Goodin and by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich. Gingrich had already been attempting to convince several reporters to print the rumor. The memo was harshly condemned by both political parties. For instance, Republican Senate leader Bob Dole said in the Senate chamber, &quot;This is not politics. This is garbage&quot;.

Atwater initially defended the memo, calling it &quot;no big deal&quot; and &quot;factually accurate&quot;. However, some days later, he claimed that he had not approved it. Under pressure from Bush, Atwater fired Goodin, replacing him with B. Jay Cooper.

Following Bush&#x27;s victory, Atwater focused on organizing a public relations campaign against Arkansas governor Bill Clinton. Atwater viewed Clinton as a serious threat to Bush in the 1992 presidential election. At the time Atwater became ill in 1990, he was supporting the bid of Representative Tommy Robinson to gain the Republican gubernatorial nomination to oppose Clinton that fall. Robinson lost the primary to former Arkla Gas CEO Sheffield Nelson. In an indication of how much importance Atwater and the RNC placed on Robinson&#x27;s bid, Missouri&#x27;s John Ashcroft, attended an Arkansas event where he was scheduled to endorse Robinson, only to discover that he had a primary opponent. Up to that point, when he met Nelson, Ashcroft thought Robinson was running unopposed. After Atwater fell ill, Robinson&#x27;s RGA support evaporated.

In 1989, Atwater became a member of the historically black Howard University Board of Trustees. The university gained national attention when students rose up in protest against Atwater&#x27;s appointment. Student activists disrupted Howard&#x27;s 122nd anniversary celebrations and eventually occupied the university&#x27;s administration building. Within days, both Atwater and Howard&#x27;s president, James E. Cheek, resigned.

Also in 1989, Atwater strongly criticized the candidacy of David Duke for the Louisiana House of Representatives. He said: &quot;David Duke is not a Republican as far as I am concerned...He is a pretender, a charlatan, and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he can find to legitimate his views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance...We repudiate him and his views and we are taking steps to see that he is disenfranchised from our party.&quot;

== Musical career ==
In 1988, Atwater and several friends, including Don Sundquist, founded a restaurant named Red Hot &amp; Blue in Arlington, Virginia. The restaurant, which has since grown into a chain, served Memphis BBQ and played Memphis blues music in the dining room.

Atwater recorded a 1990 album with B.B. King and others on Curb Records, titled &quot;Red Hot &amp; Blue&quot;. He also performed with Paul Shaffer and his band in an episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. The title track from the album earned Atwater a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Recording at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards in 1991.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and children ===

Atwater married Sally Dunbar (1951–2021) in 1978. They had three daughters, Sara Lee, Ashley Page, and Sally Theodosia. His widow ran for Superintendent of Education for South Carolina in 2014. She was endorsed by former President George H. W. Bush.

=== Illness ===
On March 5, 1990, Atwater suffered a seizure during a fundraising breakfast. Doctors discovered a grade 3 astrocytoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in his right parietal lobe. He underwent interstitial implant radiationthen a new treatmentat Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, followed by conventional radiation therapy at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. The treatment left him paralyzed on his left side, disabled his tone discrimination, and made his face and body swollen. In January 1991 he finally resigned from his chairmanship of the Republican National Committee.

=== Conversion to Catholicism and repentance ===
In the months after the severity of his illness became apparent, Atwater said he had converted to Catholicism, with the aid of Fr. John Hardon. In an act of repentance, Atwater issued a number of public and written letters to individuals to whom he had been opposed during his political career. In a June 28, 1990, letter to Tom Turnipseed, he stated, &quot;It is very important to me that I let you know that out of everything that has happened in my career, one of the low points remains the so-called &#x27;jumper cable&#x27; episode&quot;, adding, &quot;My illness has taught me something about the nature of humanity, love, brotherhood, and relationships that I never understood, and probably never would have. So, from that standpoint, there is some truth and good in everything.&quot; Turnipseed accepted Atwater&#x27;s apology and later attended his funeral.

In a February 1991 article for &quot;Life&quot;, Atwater wrote:

In the article Atwater apologized to Michael Dukakis for the &quot;naked cruelty&quot; of the 1988 presidential election campaign.

In the 2008 documentary, &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;, Ed Rollins stated:

== Death ==
Atwater died after a yearlong fight against a brain tumor on March 29, 1991. He was 40 years old.

Funeral services were held at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Atwater&#x27;s final place of residence, Columbia, South Carolina. A memorial service was held at the Washington National Cathedral on April 4, 1991.

== Legacy ==
Sidney Blumenthal has speculated that, had Atwater lived, he would have run a stronger re-election campaign for Bush than the president&#x27;s unsuccessful 1992 effort against Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.

Atwater&#x27;s political career is the subject of the 2008 feature-length documentary film &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;.

Atwater appears in the second season of the 2019 alternate history television series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;, in which he is played by Dustin Seavey.

The one-man play &quot;Atwater: Fixin&#x27; to Die&quot; by Robert Myers premiered in 1992 with Dylan Baker at New York&#x27;s West Bank Theatre, directed by Ethan McSweeny, and has been performed in various venues more than a dozen times since.

<text>Daniel Clark (c. 1766 – August 13, 1813) was an Irish-American politician who served as the first Delegate from the Territory of Orleans to the United States House of Representatives. Born in Sligo, Ireland, he was reportedly educated at Eton College in England.

Clark emigrated to the United States in the early 1780s, living with family members in Germantown, Pennsylvania. In Philadelphia, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society. In 1786, at the invitation of his merchant uncle, Daniel J. Clark, Sr. of Clarksville, Mississippi, he moved to New Orleans in Spanish Louisiana. The younger Clark streaked into the New Orleans economy, conducting at least 64 notarized transactions, mostly the sale of slaves, that year - double the number of transactions ever conducted in New Orleans in a single year before then. However, Clark&#x27;s only appearance in the 1790s as a major businessman was reflected in his numerous formal protests for debts due him in 1793.

Although he was a Spanish citizen until the late 1790s, Clark worked assiduously in the interests of the U.S. government, providing first-hand, detailed responses to President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s questions on Louisiana. Concerned about possible Spanish attempts to hold New Orleans despite the Louisiana Purchase, Clark sent vital military intelligence to Mississippi territorial governor Claiborne and American general Wilkinson, and offered to seize the city for American authorities. On the day of Louisiana&#x27;s annexation, according to a news account, Clark was &quot;everywhere and had an eye to everything.&quot;

Clark engaged in land speculation, planting, ship-owning, and banking, but delegated most of the day-to-day business of the firm to the prominent merchants Chew &amp; Relf, who usually worked with him as partners. He was appointed a member of the first Legislative Council for the Territory of Orleans, but declined. Clark was elected as the territorial representative to the U.S. House of Representatives and served from December 1, 1806, to March 3, 1809. Clark may have believed Jefferson should have appointed him as territorial governor, rather than William Charles Cole Claiborne, then governor of the Mississippi Territory. However, although Clark may have been popular with some of the Spanish elite, the prominent New Orleans merchant Benjamin Morgan cautioned about Clark: &quot;...he is not popular&quot; and &quot;deficient in dignity of character and sterling veracity...liked by few of the Americans here.&quot;,

Claiborne took offense in 1807 at a speech Clark made on the floor of the House of Representatives, in which Clark maligned Claiborne&#x27;s having allegedly favored the militia of free people of color over the white militia. When Clark would not apologize, the two men met in a June 8, 1807, duel on Clark&#x27;s plantation (currently Houmas House, in Ascension Parish, Louisiana).

Clark&#x27;s pistol round struck Claiborne. Claiborne lamented in a June 17, 1807, letter to President Thomas Jefferson, “My dear sir, I continue confined to my room, and experience considerable pain—but the wound now suppurates profusely and my Surgeon gives me reason to believe that in 3 weeks I shall be enabled to walk—I fear however that the warmth of the weather will considerably retard my recovery.”

Perhaps, in part, because of his duel against Governor Claiborne, Clark was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination to Congress in 1808. A local newspaper opined of Clark, &quot;...in his manners many complain that there is something forbidding; something that keeps at a distance even those who esteem him most.&quot; In the following year, he published a long, well-documented diatribe against General Wilkinson, entitled &quot;Proofs of the Corruption of Gen. James Wilkinson, and of his Connexion with Aaron Burr&quot;, accusing Wilkinson of being a paid Spanish agent while Wilkinson commanded the U.S. military. Subsequent historians have validated Clark&#x27;s claims. Clark died unexpectedly in New Orleans on 13 August 1813, and is interred in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1

At the time of his death, he was believed to own about one-third of the real estate in New Orleans. His will and testament, contested by the child of a secret marriage, Myra Clark Gaines, became a legal struggle of titanic proportion fought over seventy years.

<text>Julien de Lallande (Lalande) Poydras (April 3, 1740 – June 23, 1824) was a French American merchant, planter, financier, poet, educator and political leader who served as Delegate from the Territory of Orleans to the U.S. House of Representatives from 1809 to 1811. He was a catalyst in the promotion of Louisiana statehood and helped draft the state&#x27;s first constitution. He served as the first President of the Louisiana State Senate from 1812 to 1813.

==Biography==
He was born in Rezé (near Nantes), then in the French province of Brittany. He served in the French Navy and was captured by the British in 1760 and taken to England. He escaped on board a West Indian merchantman to Saint-Domingue, from which he emigrated to Spanish Louisiana in 1768.

Poydras was a pioneer businessman, trading first as an itinerant merchant before establishing stores in his domicile of Pointe Coupee Parish. He invested in real estate, buying and selling plantations and retaining some major properties for the cultivation of cotton and sugar cane. He built a number of structures during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, including North Bend plantation house, in 1835, on False River, and owned properties in New Orleans.

Poydras wrote the first poetry ever published in Louisiana in 1779, in honor of Don Bernardo de Gálvez&#x27;s victory over British troops at the Battle of Baton Rouge, popularly said to have been the only battle of the American Revolutionary War fought outside of the Thirteen Colonies.

Poydras&#x27;s reputation was that of an especially indulgent slaveholder. Yet, while on business in Philadelphia in 1795, a major slave conspiracy began on several plantations along the Mississippi River including Poydras&#x27;s home plantation. The conspirators, who evidence shows to have been urged on by white Jacobin-minded immigrants, were quickly apprehended and several were executed.

Julien Poydras willed that his slaves and their offspring be freed 25 years after his death, and all were to be provided with annuities in the meantime. Though his heirs supported his wishes, the time of the anticipated manumission (1849) coincided with the growing abolitionist movement. Fearful of its consequences, the Louisiana State Legislature prohibited any manumissions, and Poydras&#x27;s slaves remained in bondage until Union troops entered Pointe Coupee Parish in connection with the Siege of Port Hudson in 1863 — an additional 14 years.

Poydras served Louisiana as a U.S. Delegate during the territorial period and, subsequently, in the Louisiana State Senate. He served in a number of community offices in Pointe Coupee, including the post of civil commandant (under Spanish rule), justice of the peace and church warden.

After a long and active life, Julien Poydras died on his home plantation near Point Coupee, Louisiana. He was originally interred in Old St. Francis Cemetery. In 1891, his remains were reinterred on the grounds of the Poydras School in New Roads, when the old cemetery caved into the Mississippi River.
OBITUARY of Julien Poydras 1824, on the 25th of June, at Point Coupee, Louisiana; JULIEN POYDRAS, esq. Mr. P. was a man of very large fortune, and magnificent disposition. He was the first Delegate in Congress, from the territory of Orleans. The act, which no doubt will do most honour to his memory, is the foundation of the Female Orphan Asylum, to which he devoted £100,000. Long after many celebrated names shall have been sunk in oblivion, the name of Julien Poydras will be remembered by the innocent creatures who, by his wise providence and humanity, shall have been sheltered against the misfortune and danger which result from misery, for a weak defenseless sex. By his will he left for a college at Pointe Coupee, 20,000 dollars. For marriage portions to poor girls of said parish, 30,000 dollars. To each of his god-sons and goddaughters, 5,000 dollars. For marriage portions to poor girls of the parish of West Baton Rouge, 30,000 dollars. To the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, his house on the Levee, between St. Louis and Conti streets, and his house in Bourbon street. To the Poydras Female Asylum, all his houses in Poydras Street, and on the Batture. The remainder of his fortune goes to his family with the exception of some legacies to his friends.

In Pointe Coupee the legacy has been diverted to educational purposes, but in West Baton Rouge it continues in its original use [1941]. Poydras himself was a bachelor. It is said that, when he came to Louisiana, he owned little more than the pack on his back and, as the girl he loved was too poor to furnish a dowry, it was impossible for them to marry. 
==Legacy==
Among the philanthropic works during his lifetime, Julien Poydras founded the Poydras Asylum in New Orleans, originally a home for female orphans. The community transitioned to nursing care for elderly females but now accommodating persons of both genders. The Poydras Home has expanded in recent years to a continuing care retirement community complete with Independent, Assisted Living, Nursing Care and an Adult Day Program on its historic Magazine Street campus.

One of Julien Poydras&#x27;s more unusual bequests was for dowries of indigent brides in Pointe Coupee and West Baton Rouge Parishes. Legend attributes Julien&#x27;s lifelong single status to the inability of his fiancée&#x27;s family to provide the usual dowry in order for them to marry. Although the dowry fund in Pointe Coupee Parish was combined with the educational fund, the dowries continued to be issued on an annual basis at least until 1991 in West Baton Rouge Parish, each year&#x27;s brides receiving an equal share of the interest accrued on the principal during the year.

One of the main streets of the New Orleans Central Business District has been named Poydras ever since Julien Poydras owned property there. There is an elegant residential thoroughfare in New Roads called Poydras. A succession of New Roads Schools were named for the philanthropist: Poydras College, Poydras School of New Roads, Poydras Academy, and Poydras High School. The latter, built in 1924, is now home to the Julien Poydras Museum and Cultural Center, a project of the Pointe Coupee Parish Historical Society. There is also a town in St. Bernard Parish called Poydras.

<text>Donna Marie Christian-Christensen, formerly Donna Christian-Green (born September 19, 1945), is an American physician and politician. She served as the 4th elected non-voting Delegate from the United States Virgin Islands&#x27;s at-large district to the United States House of Representatives from 1997 until 2015.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born Donna Christian in Teaneck, New Jersey, she is the daughter of a Virgin Islands Federal District Court judge, Almeric Christian. She received her Bachelor of Science from St. Mary&#x27;s College in Notre Dame, Indiana in 1966. Christensen then attended the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C., where she received an M.D. in 1970. She interned at San Francisco&#x27;s Pacific Medical Center from 1970 to 1971 and performed her residency in family medicine at Howard University Medical Center from 1973 to 1974.

===Career===
Donna Christian-Christensen worked as a physician, first in the emergency room and later in the maternity ward. She then served as medical director for the St. Croix Hospital in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. She was the Acting Commissioner of Health for the Virgin Islands in 1993 and 1994 and also ran a private medical practice until 1996.

Christian was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions from 1994 through 2012 elections. She has also previously served on the Status Commission and the Board of Education for the USVI.

She was also active in community organizations in the Virgin Islands, working to protect St. Croix from overdevelopment, and leading an effort to improve the quality of local judicial appointments.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Donna Christian-Christensen ran unsuccessfully for the position of USVI delegate in 1994, losing in the primary to former judge Eileen Petersen. She won a three-way race beating Victor Frazer, an Independent. That race also included future Governor Kenneth Mapp, who would defeat Christensen in 2014 during the Governor race. However, she was elected as a Democrat to the House in a 1996 runoff with Frazer and served from January 3, 1997, to January 3, 2015.

Christian-Christensen has supported Obama&#x27;s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Shortly before the Supreme Court affirmed the legislation, she said &quot;For 99 years, presidents have been trying to do this. Finally, our president has made it possible for each and every American.&quot;

Donna Christian-Christensen is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She was featured on The Colbert Report&#x27;s &quot;Better Know a Protectorate&quot; segment. She is also the first female physician to win a congressional election.

===Elections===
;2008

During the 2008 electoral campaign, she appeared in a TV advertisement endorsing the reelection of neighboring Puerto Rico Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, who went to trial after the November 2008 elections for a twenty-four-count federal Grand Jury indictment for corruption. The jury found him not guilty, though he did lose his bid for re-election.

;2010

Christian-Christensen won her 2010 reelection campaign with 71.22% of the vote.

;2012

Christian-Christensen received substantial donations, at least $37,000, for her re-election from sources that are connected to Jeffrey Thompson, the chartered health services chairman. However, since he had recently come under fire for a scandal, this money may have been considered to be &quot;pecunia non grata&quot; (unwanted money). Soon after, Thompson&#x27;s firm was awarded a $6.3 million government contract in the Virgin Islands, Christensen&#x27;s home district. Nonetheless, Christian-Christensen won her 2012 re-election bid with 60.05% of the vote.

;2014

Christian-Christensen did not seek re-election to her congressional seat. Instead, she ran for Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, ultimately losing to Kenneth Mapp in a runoff.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
**Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Black Caucus
*Congressional Caucus on Women&#x27;s Issues
*Congressional Progressive Caucus
*Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus
*International Conservation Caucus
*Congressional Arts Caucus

==Honors and recognitions==
On March 23, 2009, Delegate Christensen became the Ship Sponsor of the USCGC &quot;Reef Shark&quot; during the vessel&#x27;s commissioning ceremony in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The &quot;Reef Shark&quot; is a new 87&#x27; cutter, built at an approximate cost of $7.5 million by Bollinger Shipyards in Lockport, Louisiana.

<doc id="309638" wikidata="Q6742191" url="?curid=309638" title="Malcolm Blight">
<text>Malcolm Jack Blight AM (born 16 February 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for and coached the North Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and Woodville Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). He also coached the Geelong Football Club, Adelaide Football Club and St Kilda Football Club.

Blight is, to date, the only player to have kicked 100 goals in a season in both the VFL and the SANFL. He is also one of three players to have won the Brownlow Medal and the Magarey Medal. He was an inaugural inductee Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 and was elevated to Legend status in 2017. In addition, he has captained the state representative sides of both Victoria and South Australia.

In spite of his &quot;failure&quot; as a playing coach of North Melbourne, Blight cemented his reputation as one of the greatest coaches during his stints with and , before finishing up in an acrimonious circumstances at . In 2012, Blight was appointed director of coaching at the Gold Coast Football Club.

The surname &quot;Blight&quot; is of Cornish origin.

==Football career==

===1968–1973: First stint at Woodville===
Blight grew up living close to Alberton Oval and supported , with his favourite player at the time being forward Rex Johns. However, when a new local team Woodville began to play in the SANFL from 1964, and Blight was in their recruiting zone and made his debut for the Woodpeckers in 1969. He had a break-out year in 1972, kicking 45 goals while playing mainly as a ruck-rover. He won Woodville&#x27;s best and fairest award as well as the SANFL&#x27;s highest individual honor, the Magarey Medal, bringing him to the attention of the VFL.

===1974–1982: Success in Victoria with North Melbourne===
Blight was recruited by the North Melbourne Football Club and, although he was reluctant to join at first, he went on to play 178 games for the club between 1974 and 1982. He was a member of the Kangaroos&#x27; premiership sides in 1975 and 1977, and in 1978 won both the Brownlow Medal and the Syd Barker Medal for being the best and fairest player in the VFL and for North Melbourne respectively.

Blight was consistently one of the most brilliant players in the VFL during the 1970s. Besides taking spectacular marks, he was also a prolific goal kicker, renowned for his ability to use the torpedo punt. In 1982, Blight won the Coleman Medal as the leading the VFL goal scorer, and led the Kangaroos&#x27; goal kicking four times during his career.

====Eighty-metre goal after the siren====

In a moment that has since passed into Australian rules football folklore, Blight kicked a famous goal after the siren against Carlton in Round 10, 1976, (5 June). Carlton led by 14 points going into added time in the final quarter, but Blight kicked two goals, and then marked the ball an estimated 80 metres from goal, just seconds before the final siren. North Melbourne, trailing by one point, needed a behind to draw and a goal to win. Many assumed Blight&#x27;s effort would be futile and spectators were already exiting the arena. However, Blight kicked one of the longest-ever torpedo punts, with the ball going through the goal at the height of the posts, achieving an improbable victory for the Kangaroos: 11.15 (81) to Carlton&#x27;s 11.10 (76). (YouTube video)

This moment was the focus of a television commercial in the Toyota Legendary Moments series which featured Blight. (YouTube video)

====Infamous moments====
During the 1977 VFL season, which happened to be played during the wettest Melbourne winter in 40 years, hosted at Arden Street. The ground conditions were atrocious, and the match for the most part resembled something more akin to mud wrestling. Hawthorn led by one point when Blight was given a free kick and a set shot for goal. He scored a behind, which would have levelled the scores, but was given a second attempt after the umpire penalised Hawthorn for an infringement. Unfortunately for Blight and North Melbourne, the ball slewed off the side of his boot and went out of bounds on the full, giving the Hawks victory. In the drawn Grand Final, he was benched by Barassi after three quarters, but kept his place in the team for the replay and was one of the best players in their win.

Blight won the 1978 Brownlow Medal, but suffered a groin injury in the early minutes of the 1978 VFL Grand Final against Hawthorn.

In 1981, while still serving as playing coach, Blight made one of the most bizarre blunders ever seen in a football match. In North Melbourne&#x27;s Round 14 clash against at the MCG, Blight was on the end of a chain of handpasses deep in the forward zone. He seemed certain to score a goal as he ran into the goal square, only to run past the goal posts and kick the ball through the behinds. As he said after the match when he realised his mistake: &quot;I&#x27;ve never done that before. I&#x27;m probably going barmy.&quot; Richmond won the match by 43 points and, less than a month later, after six consecutive losses, Blight was sacked as playing coach. Freed of the coaching burden, he then kicked 11 goals against .

Blight was indirectly involved in another infamous football incident during the 1980 Escort Cup grand final against Collingwood, held at VFL Park, Waverley. Blight kicked the ball to Kerry Good as the siren sounded. However, the umpire did not hear the siren and awarded the mark to Good, who kicked the winning goal to win in controversial circumstances.

===1983–1985: Return to Woodville===
After his stint in the VFL, Blight returned to Woodville, serving as captain-coach from 1983 to 1985 before continuing as non-playing coach in 1986 and 1987. He was club best and fairest in 1983 and in his last season of playing football (1985) topped the league goalkicking list with 126 goals.

===Other matches===
Blight also played 14 interstate/State of Origin football matches (seven for South Australia and seven for Victoria), kicking 25 goals, as well as 11 pre-season/night series matches for Woodville, kicking 17 goals, and 17 pre-season/night series matches for North Melbourne, kicking 37 goals (these are counted as senior by the SANFL but not the VFL/AFL).

If these are included, Blight played a total of 372 senior career games and kicked a senior career total of 865 goals.

==Coaching and after coaching==
Blight later became a successful coach famous for employing unorthodox, and at times controversial, coaching methods as attempts to motivate his players.

===Player-coach at North Melbourne===
Appointed player-coach in 1981 after Ron Barassi departed, Blight was sacked as coach after six consecutive losses. The following week he rebounded with a club-record 11 goal haul against Footscray, at the Western Oval. Once again, Blight&#x27;s inaccurate kicking for goal may have prevented him from kicking a club record of a possible 16 to 17 goals. Blight&#x27;s total as playing coach (Wayne Schimmelbusch was captain) was 16 games (6 wins, 10 losses) and the last of the playing coaches in the VFL.

===Back at Woodville===
Playing coach 1983 to 1985, continued as non-playing coach to 1987. His tenure as coach coincided with the club&#x27;s most successful season (1986) in the entire history of the Woodville Football Club, when they reached the Preliminary Final. During the season the Warriors (who had changed from being known as the Woodpeckers to the Warriors in 1983) had defeated their hated &quot;big brother&quot; Port Adelaide once during the minor round at Woodville Oval (drawing the oval&#x27;s ground record attendance of 11,026 to their Round 18 clash), and also in the First Semi-final at Football Park, before going down to eventual premiers Glenelg in the Preliminary Final.

===Geelong Football Club senior coach (1989–1994): High-Voltage Football, September Disappointment===
Blight was appointed successor to John Devine at as senior coach for the 1989 VFL season. In Blight&#x27;s first year at Geelong, he guided them to the 1989 Grand Final but fell short to Hawthorn by six points. In the 1990 season, Geelong under Blight finished tenth on the ladder with eight wins and fourteen losses, missing out of the finals. In the 1991 season, Blight guided Geelong to finish third on the ladder, but were eliminated in the Preliminary Final by West Coast Eagles. Blight guided Geelong again to the Grand Final in 1992 but fell short again to West Coast Eagles by twenty-eight points. In the 1993 season, Blight guided Geelong to finish seventh on the ladder with twelve wins and eight losses, just missing out of the finals.

The Cats players warmed to his all-out attack philosophy, to such an extent that they broke the record for aggregate points in a home-and-away season (2916), which would again be broken in 1992 when they became the first (and so far only) team to score an aggregate of 3000 points in a home-and-away season. In the semi-final against , aware that the Demons intended to put a hard tag on their classy midfielders Paul Couch and Mark Bairstow, Blight started them on the interchange bench, and Geelong ended up winning by 63 points.

In an interview with Gerard Whateley in 2019, Blight opened up about the day he knew his time as Geelong coach was finished. In Round 12 of the 1994 AFL season, Geelong were hosting at Kardinia Park, and at last break the unfancied Saints held a 26-point lead after kicking seven goals to none in the third quarter. The frustrated home fans directed their displeasure at Blight, booing and heckling him as he made his way down to the huddle. Although he made light of this to his assistant coach and soon-to-be successor Gary Ayres by remarking &quot;I told you, the Geelong people don&#x27;t like you Hawthorn people&quot;, Blight was stung inwardly by the negative reception. Fortunately for the home side, star forward Gary Ablett kicked four of his seven goals as Geelong came from behind to win by three points. The Cats ended up making the Grand Final in 1994 for the third time under Blight, but after a difficult finals series, they were no match for , where Geelong fell short to West Coast by eighty points in the 1994 Grand Final and Blight confirmed his decision after the game to hand the coaching reins to assistant coach Gary Ayres, who replaced Blight as Geelong Football Club senior coach.

One of the strangest incidents as a coach of Geelong was his extroverted decision to stand on a metal box to watch the game against the West Coast Eagles in Perth. His excitement of &quot;seeing the game at ground level&quot;, was an attempt to get back to basics and some nostalgia.

Blight coached Geelong Football Club from 1989 to 1994 to a total of 145 games with 89 wins and 56 losses with a winning percentage of 61 percent.

===Adelaide Football Club senior coach (1997–1999) : Premiership success===
Blight&#x27;s then made his arrival at the Crows at the end of the 1996 season, when he replaced Robert Shaw as senior coach of Adelaide Football Club. This was marked with dramatic effect, with the delisting of four ageing club stalwarts Tony McGuinness, Chris McDermott, Andrew Jarman and Greg Anderson. This attracted great criticism at the time, but Blight was vindicated, when Adelaide Football Club under Blight won the AFL premiership in 1997, and again in 1998 for the second consecutive year. Blight resigned as Adelaide Football Club senior coach at the end of the 1999 season after an unsuccessful year finishing 13th. In 74 games under Blight, Adelaide won 41 games and 33 losses bringing a winning percentage to 55 percent. But he will always be remembered for his finals record with seven wins from eight games for two premierships To commemorate his legacy as Adelaide&#x27;s first premiership coach, the club named their annual best and fairest award the Malcolm Blight Medal. Blight was once again replaced by Gary Ayres, this time as Adelaide Football Club senior coach.

===St Kilda Football Club senior coach (2001): Promising start, disappointing end===
After finishing at Adelaide, Blight decided to retire from football and moved to Queensland. St Kilda officials visited him there during 2000 and overcame his reluctance to coach St Kilda in 2001 with a $1 million offer. Blight then replaced Tim Watson as the St Kilda Football Club senior coach. Blight was however sacked after Round 15 during the 2001 season with three wins and twelve losses sitting at fourteenth (third-last) on the ladder. Blight was then replaced by Grant Thomas as caretaker senior coach for the rest of the 2001 season, who was eventually appointed as full-time senior coach. Blight&#x27;s famous humiliation of the players by making them stay on Colonial Stadium after a Round 10 loss to Melbourne and again after a Round 15 loss to Adelaide in his final game as coach, highlighted the worsening relation between the coach, players and club supporters. Some years later the former president of St Kilda, Rod Butterss, questioned Blight&#x27;s commitment to the club during his tenure. Blight responded memorably from his position as media commentator with Channel Ten, saying: 

However, as early as February 2003, Butterss had admitted that his appointment of Blight as coach was &quot;an error.&quot; In August 2017, Butterss further admitted that he&#x27;d made crucial decisions (including the Blight saga) while under the influence of drugs and alcohol during his tenure at the club.

Blight coached St Kilda Football club in 2001 to a total of 15 games with three wins and twelve losses to a winning percentage of 20 percent.

===Involvement at Gold Coast Suns===
In 2009, Blight joined the Board of directors at the 17th AFL team, Gold Coast Suns.

In July 2012, Gold Coast Suns announced that Blight had stepped down from the board to take up a part-time advisory role as director of coaching under Gold Coast Suns senior coach Guy McKenna, following a similar growing trend where former coaches (among them Mark Williams, Dean Laidley and Mark Harvey) have been employed as advisors to other senior coaches. Blight left the Gold Coast Suns at the end of the 2015 season, after he was relieved of his duties as director of coaching position at Gold Coast. Blight and the club came to a mutual agreement that the position had become redundant after the appointment of Rodney Eade as senior coach of the Gold Coast Suns at the start of the year and season.

===Blight&#x27;s Squad of Champions===
Looking back over his coaching career, Blight nominated in June 2012 a team of the greatest 22 players that he had coached, plus four emergencies. This was how the team looked:

The four emergencies named were: Peter Caven (Adelaide), Kane Johnson (Adelaide), Peter Riccardi (Geelong) and Tony Modra (Adelaide).

==Media career==
Blight continued his football involvement through the media. He commentated for the Seven Network during his hiatus from coaching in 1988, 1995–1996 and 2000, and also co-hosted &quot;Talking Footy&quot; with fellow commentator Bruce McAvaney and journalist Mike Sheahan. He was one of the commentators at Waverley Park during the famous &quot;Lights Out Incident&quot; during a night match between and in 1996. After finishing up as a coach, Blight commentated for Network Ten&#x27;s television coverage.

In 2006, Blight appeared in a Toyota Legendary Moment ad recreating his goal after the siren against Carlton.

He also wrote football-related articles for the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;.

Blight is known for his dislike of the practice of players using grubber kicks when attempting to score a goal, due to the lack of control and unpredictability of the bounce. With David Wildy, he is currently the co-host of Sportsday SA on FIVEaa in Adelaide.

<text>Ronald de Lugo (August 2, 1930 – July 14, 2020) was an American politician. He was the first Delegate from the United States Virgin Islands to the United States House of Representatives.

Ron de Lugo&#x27;s parents were Puerto Ricans. His grandfather owned a hardware store and gun dealership in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas. De Lugo&#x27;s parents were living in New Jersey at the time he was born and also lived in the Virgin Islands as civil servants. He was born in Englewood, New Jersey, and attended the Colegio San José in the Río Piedras district of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

De Lugo served in the United States Army as a program director and announcer for the Armed Forces Radio Service. He worked at WSTA radio in St. Thomas and also at WIVI in St. Croix. He was a Virgin Islands territorial Senator, a Democratic National Committeeman, the administrator for St. Croix, the representative of the Virgin Islands to Washington, D.C., and a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1956, 1960, 1964 and 1968.

After the position of Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives was created for the Virgin Islands, De Lugo was the first to be elected to the office, in 1972. He served as a Democrat, from January 3, 1973 to January 3, 1979.

De Lugo chose not to seek re-election as Delegate in 1978 so as to pursue a bid for Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. He challenged incumbent Governor Juan Francisco Luis in the 1978 gubernatorial election. De Lugo chose Eric E. Dawson, a Senator in the Legislature of the Virgin Islands, as his running mate for lieutenant governor. Luis defeated de Lugo in the general election on November 7, 1978. Luis and Lt. Gov. Henry Millin won 10,978 votes (59.2%); De Lugo and Dawson placed second with 7,568 votes (40.8%). The Luis-Millin ticket won all three of the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; main islands.

De Lugo was elected Delegate again, serving from January 3, 1981 to January 3, 1995; he did not seek re-election in 1994. During this time in office De Lugo chaired the committed on creating the Guam into a Commonwealth. After retiring, he was a resident of St. Croix. De Lugo died on July 14, 2020 at an assisted living facility in Miami, Florida, less than a month before his 90th birthday.

<text>Continental philosophy is an umbrella term for philosophies most prominent in continental Europe, which the contemporary political thinker Michael E. Rosen has identified with certain common themes, deriving from a broadly Kantian tradition and focused on personal philosophical reflection rather than exclusively empirical inquiry.

Continental philosophy includes German idealism, phenomenology, existentialism (and its antecedents, such as the thought of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche), hermeneutics, structuralism, post-structuralism, deconstruction, French feminism, psychoanalytic theory, and the critical theory of the Frankfurt School as well as branches of Freudian, Hegelian and Western Marxist views. Continental philosophy is often contrasted with analytic philosophy.

There is no academic consensus on the definition of continental philosophy. Prior to the twentieth century, the term &quot;continental&quot; was used broadly to refer to philosophy from continental Europe. A different use of the term originated among English-speaking philosophers in the second half of the 20th century, who used it to refer to a range of thinkers and traditions outside the analytic movement. The term &quot;continental philosophy&quot; may mark merely a family resemblance across disparate philosophical views; Hans-Johann Glock has made a similar argument for analytic philosophy. Simon Glendinning has suggested that the term “continental philosophy” was originally more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers.

==Definition==
The term &quot;continental philosophy&quot;, in the above sense, was first widely used by English-speaking philosophers to describe university courses in the 1970s, emerging as a collective name for the philosophies then widespread in France and Germany, such as phenomenology, existentialism, structuralism, and post-structuralism.

However, the term (and its approximate sense) can be found at least as early as 1840, in John Stuart Mill&#x27;s 1840 essay on Coleridge, where Mill contrasts the Kantian-influenced thought of &quot;Continental philosophy&quot; and &quot;Continental philosophers&quot; with the English empiricism of Bentham and the 18th century generally. This notion gained prominence in the early 20th century as figures such as Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore advanced a vision of philosophy closely allied with natural science, progressing through logical analysis. This tradition, which has come to be known broadly as &quot;analytic philosophy&quot;, became dominant in Britain and the United States from roughly 1930 onward. Russell and Moore made a dismissal of Hegelianism and its philosophical relatives a distinctive part of their new movement. Commenting on the history of the distinction in 1945, Russell distinguished &quot;two schools of philosophy, which may be broadly distinguished as the Continental and the British respectively&quot;, a division he saw as operative &quot;from the time of Locke&quot;; Russell proposes the following broad points of distinction between Continental and British types of philosophy:

# in method, deductive system-building vs. piecemeal induction;
# in metaphysics, rationalist theology vs. metaphysical agnosticism;
# in ethics, non-naturalist deontology vs. naturalist hedonism; and
# in politics, authoritarianism vs. liberalism.

Since the 1970s, however, many philosophers in the United States and Britain have taken an interest in continental philosophers since Kant, and the philosophical traditions in many European countries have similarly incorporated many aspects of the &quot;analytic&quot; movement. Self-described analytic philosophy flourishes in France, including philosophers such as Jules Vuillemin, Vincent Descombes, Gilles Gaston Granger, François Recanati, and Pascal Engel. Likewise, self-described &quot;continental philosophers&quot; can be found in philosophy departments in the United Kingdom, North America, and Australia. &quot;Continental philosophy&quot; is thus defined in terms of a family of philosophical traditions and influences rather than a geographic distinction. The issue of geographical specificity has been raised again more recently in post-colonial and decolonial approaches to &quot;continental philosophy&quot;, which critically examine the ways that European imperial and colonial projects have influenced academic knowledge production. For this reason, Nelson Maldonado-Torres has advocated for &quot;post-continental philosophy&quot; as an outgrowth of continental philosophy.

===Characteristics===
The term &quot;continental philosophy&quot;, like &quot;analytic philosophy&quot;, lacks a clear definition and may mark merely a family resemblance across disparate philosophical views. Simon Glendinning has suggested that the term was originally more pejorative than descriptive, functioning as a label for types of western philosophy rejected or disliked by analytic philosophers. Nonetheless, Michael E. Rosen has ventured to identify common themes that typically characterize continental philosophy. The themes derive from a broadly Kantian thesis that knowledge, experience, and reality are bound and shaped by conditions best understood through philosophical reflection rather than exclusively empirical inquiry.
#Continental philosophers generally reject the view that the natural sciences are the only or most accurate way of understanding natural phenomena. This contrasts with many analytic philosophers who consider their inquiries as continuous with, or subordinate to, those of the natural sciences. Continental philosophers often argue that science depends upon a &quot;pre-theoretical substrate of experience&quot; (a version of Kantian conditions of possible experience or the phenomenological &quot;lifeworld&quot;) and that scientific methods are inadequate to fully understand such conditions of intelligibility.
#Continental philosophy usually considers these conditions of possible experience as variable: determined at least partly by factors such as context, space and time, language, culture, or history. Thus continental philosophy tends toward historicism (or historicity). Where analytic philosophy tends to treat philosophy in terms of discrete problems, capable of being analyzed apart from their historical origins (much as scientists consider the history of science inessential to scientific inquiry), continental philosophy typically suggests that &quot;philosophical argument cannot be divorced from the textual and contextual conditions of its historical emergence.&quot;
#Continental philosophy typically holds that human agency can change these conditions of possible experience: &quot;if human experience is a contingent creation, then it can be recreated in other ways.&quot; Thus continental philosophers tend to take a strong interest in the unity of theory and practice, and often see their philosophical inquiries as closely related to personal, moral, or political transformation. This tendency is very clear in the Marxist tradition (&quot;philosophers have only &quot;interpreted&quot; the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to &quot;change&quot; it&quot;), but is also central in existentialism and post-structuralism.
#A final characteristic trait of continental philosophy is an emphasis on metaphilosophy. In the wake of the development and success of the natural sciences, continental philosophers have often sought to redefine the method and nature of philosophy. In some cases (such as German idealism or phenomenology), this manifests as a renovation of the traditional view that philosophy is the first, foundational, &quot;a priori&quot; science. In other cases (such as hermeneutics, critical theory, or structuralism), it is held that philosophy investigates a domain that is irreducibly cultural or practical. And some continental philosophers (such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, or later Heidegger) doubt whether any conception of philosophy can coherently achieve its stated goals.

==History==
The history of continental philosophy (taken in the narrower sense of &quot;late modern/contemporary continental philosophy&quot;) is usually thought to begin with German idealism. Led by figures like Fichte, Schelling, and later Hegel, German idealism developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s and was closely linked with romanticism and the revolutionary politics of the Enlightenment. Besides the central figures listed above, important contributors to German idealism also included Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Gottlob Ernst Schulze, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, and Friedrich Schleiermacher.As the institutional roots of &quot;continental philosophy&quot; in many cases directly descend from those of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl has always been a canonical figure in continental philosophy. Nonetheless, Husserl is also a respected subject of study in the analytic tradition. Husserl&#x27;s notion of a noema, the non-psychological content of thought, his correspondence with Gottlob Frege, and his investigations into the nature of logic continue to generate interest among analytic philosophers.

J. G. Merquior argued that a distinction between analytic and continental philosophies can be first clearly identified with Henri Bergson (1859–1941), whose wariness of science and elevation of intuition paved the way for existentialism. Merquior wrote: &quot;the most prestigious philosophizing in France took a very dissimilar path [from the Anglo-Germanic analytic schools]. One might say it all began with Henri Bergson.&quot;

An illustration of some important differences between &quot;analytic&quot; and &quot;continental&quot; styles of philosophy can be found in Rudolf Carnap&#x27;s &quot;Elimination of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language&quot; (1932; &quot;Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache&quot;), a paper some observers have described as particularly polemical. Carnap&#x27;s paper argues that Heidegger&#x27;s lecture &quot;What Is Metaphysics?&quot; violates logical syntax to create nonsensical pseudo-statements. Moreover, Carnap claimed that many German metaphysicians of the era were similar to Heidegger in writing statements that were syntactically meaningless.

With the rise of Nazism, many of Germany&#x27;s philosophers, especially those of Jewish descent or leftist or liberal political sympathies (such as many in the Vienna Circle and the Frankfurt School), fled to the English-speaking world. Those philosophers who remained—if they remained in academia at all—had to reconcile themselves to Nazi control of the universities. Others, such as Martin Heidegger, among the most prominent German philosophers to stay in Germany, aligned themselves with Nazism when it came to power.

===20th-century French philosophy===

Both before and after World War II there was a growth of interest in German philosophy in France. A new interest in communism translated into an interest in Marx and Hegel, who became for the first time studied extensively in the politically conservative French university system of the Third Republic. At the same time the phenomenological philosophy of Husserl and Heidegger became increasingly influential, perhaps owing to its resonances with French philosophies which placed great stock in the first-person perspective (an idea found in divergent forms such as Cartesianism, spiritualism, and Bergsonism). Most important in this popularization of phenomenology was the author and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who called his philosophy &quot;existentialism&quot;.

Another major strain of continental thought is structuralism/post-structuralism. Influenced by the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure, French anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss began to apply the structural paradigm to the humanities. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, post-structuralists developed various critiques of structuralism. Post-structuralist thinkers include Jacques Derrida and Gilles Deleuze. After this wave, most of the late 20th century, the tradition has been carried into the 21st century by Quentin Meillassoux, Tristan Garcia, Francois Laruelle, and others.

=== Recent Anglo-American developments ===

From the early 20th century until the 1960s, continental philosophers were only intermittently discussed in British and American universities, despite an influx of continental philosophers, particularly German Jewish students of Nietzsche and Heidegger, to the United States on account of the persecution of the Jews and later World War II; Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Leo Strauss, Theodor W. Adorno, and Walter Kaufmann are probably the most notable of this wave, arriving in the late 1930s and early 1940s. However, philosophy departments began offering courses in continental philosophy in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Continental Philosophy features prominently in a number of British and Irish Philosophy departments, for instance at the University of Essex, Warwick, Newcastle, Sussex, Dundee, Aberdeen (Centre for Modern Thought), and University College Dublin; as well as Manchester Metropolitan, Kingston, Staffordshire (postgraduate only), and the Open University.

American university departments in literature, the fine arts, film, sociology, and political theory have increasingly incorporated ideas and arguments from continental philosophers into their curricula and research. North American Philosophy departments offering courses in Continental Philosophy include the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, Boston College, Stony Brook University, Vanderbilt University, DePaul University, Villanova University, the University of Guelph, The New School, Pennsylvania State University, University of Oregon, Emory University, University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, the University of Memphis, University of King&#x27;s College, and Loyola University Chicago. The most prominent organization for continental philosophy in the United States is the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP).

== Continental philosophy ==
Continental philosophy is often contrasted with analytic philosophy. There is widespread influence and debate between the analytic and continental traditions; some philosophers see the differences between the two traditions as being based on institutions, relationships, and ideology rather than anything of significant philosophical substance. The distinction has also been drawn as analytic is academic or technical philosophy, while continental is literary philosophy.

<text>Melvin Herbert Evans (August 7, 1917 – November 27, 1984) was an American politician who served as Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, the first black person elected governor in the United States&#x27; history. After his tenure as governor he served as the territory&#x27;s at-large delegate to the United States House of Representatives and ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago.

Evans was born Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands, in 1917, and was the valedictorian of his high school class. He graduated magna cum laude from Howard University and later the University of California, Berkeley. From 1959 to 1967, he was the health commissioner of the U.S. Virgin Islands and oversaw a decline in infant mortality.

President Richard Nixon appointed Evans as the islands&#x27; governor, the last one to be appointed rather than elected, and became its first elected governor. His tenure saw a great increase in road construction and he chaired the Southern Governors&#x27; Association. He lost reelection in 1974, but was elected to one term in the U.S. House.

==Early life==
Melvin Herbert Evans was born in Christiansted, U.S. Virgin Islands, on August 7, 1917, to Charles Herbert Evans and Maude Rogiers. He was raised by his mother and grandparents after his father moved to New York City. In 1935, he graduated from Charlotte Amalie High School in Saint Thomas as valedictorian.

Evans graduated from Howard University with a Bachelor of Science degree as magna cum laude in 1940, and a Doctor of Medicine in 1944. He received a Master of Public Health from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. He was a member of Phi Beta Sigma. He studied cardiology under Helen B. Taussig at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He met Mary Phyllis Anderson when she was a nurse at a hospital in New York. They married in 1945, and had four children.

==Medical and appointments==
From 1942 to 1945, Evans was a second lieutenant in the United States Army Medical Corps. He interned at Harlem Hospital in New York City from 1944 to 1945. At Frederiksted Municipal Hospital in St. Croix he was physician-in-charge from 1945 to 1948, a medical assistant in 1950, and chief municipal physician from 1951 to 1959.

Infant mortality fell to match the national average in the United States and Anopheles were eliminated during Evans&#x27; tenure as health commissioner for the U.S. Virgin Islands from 1959 to 1967. He was on the board of the island&#x27;s Selective Service Board of Appeals from 1967 to 1969. He was the first chair of the board of trustees for the University of the Virgin Islands and president of the Virgin Islands Medical Association.

==Governor==
===Elections===
Ralph Moses Paiewonsky resigned as governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. President Richard Nixon initially nominated Peter Bove of Vermont, but withdrew after the Republican members of the Interior and Insular Affairs committee refused to support his nomination. Bove faced sexual misconduct allegations and conflict of interests over properties he owned on the islands. Evans, a Democrat who became a Republican in 1968, was appointed by Nixon on June 13, 1969, and confirmed by the United States Senate on June 19. Evans was the first native-born black man to govern the island. Two inaugurations, one on St. Thomas on July 1 and another on St. Croix on July 2, were held for him.

The Elective Governor Acts of 1968 provided for the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands to be elected. At the time of the 1970 gubernatorial election the Democrats held all of the seats in the legislature and only 1,316 voters were registered Republicans compared to 13,817 Democrats. Evans became the territory&#x27;s first elected governor and the first black person elected governor in the nation after he placed first in the initial round, which saw the Democratic nominee place third, and defeated Cyril King of the Independent Citizens Movement in the run-off. King attacked him for selecting David Earle Maas, white man, as his lieutenant governor. Evans was sworn in on January 4, 1971, by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. He lost reelection in 1974.

===Tenure===
25.3 miles of roads were constructed during Evans&#x27; first year as governor, more than were constructed in the previous ten years. The Consumer Protection Council was also formed during his tenure. The size of the United States Virgin Islands Police Department rose from 105 to 445 police officers between 1969 and 1974. He was critical of prior administrations for prioritizing vacation amenities over other issues.

In 1971, Evans appointed George O&#x27;Reilly Jr. to fill a vacancy in the legislature created by Lew Muckle&#x27;s death. Evans was appointed vice-chair of the Southern Governors&#x27; Association under chair George Wallace in 1972, and chaired it from 1973 to 1974. He was the first black person to hold both roles.

===Later career and death===
A liberal Republican, Evans was the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; member of the Republican National Committee from 1976 to 1980, and attended the 1972 and 1976 Republican National Conventions as a delegate. He supported a failed 1979 referendum for a new constitution for the islands.

Ron de Lugo, the U.S. Virgin Islands&#x27; non-voting member of the United States House of Representatives, declined to run for reelection in 1978, and sought the governorship instead. Evans was elected to succeed him, but lost reelection in 1980 to de Lugo. He served on the Armed Services, Interior and Insular Affairs, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries committees during his tenure. He was the only black member of the Republican caucus and the first Republican to join the Congressional Black Caucus, with another Republican not joining until Gary Franks.

President Ronald Reagan appointed Evans as the United States&#x27; ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on November 6, 1981. He was approved on December 1, 1981, and presented his credentials on January 1, 1982. He died in Christiansted after suffering a heart attack on November 28, 1984, and was buried in the Christiansted Cemetery. In 1985, the U.S. Virgin Islands legislature declared his birthday to be Melvin H. Evans Day.

<text>Carl Milton Bernstein ( ; born February 14, 1944) is an American investigative journalist and author. While a young reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1972, Bernstein was teamed up with Bob Woodward, and the two did much of the original news reporting on the Watergate scandal. These scandals led to numerous government investigations and the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon. The work of Woodward and Bernstein was called &quot;maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time&quot; by long-time journalism figure Gene Roberts.

Bernstein&#x27;s career since Watergate has continued to focus on the theme of the use and abuse of power via books and magazine articles. He has also done reporting for television and opinion commentary. He is the author or co-author of six books: &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Final Days&quot; (1976), both with Bob Woodward; &quot;Loyalties: A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot; (1989); &quot;His Holiness: John Paul II and the History of Our Time&quot; (1996) with Marco Politi; &quot;A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton&quot; (2007); and &quot;Chasing History: A Kid in the Newsroom&quot; (2022), a memoir of his early years in journalism. Additionally, he is a regular political commentator on CNN.

==Early life and career==
Bernstein was born to a secular Jewish family in Washington, D.C. He was the son of Sylvia (née Walker) and Alfred Bernstein. Both his parents were civil-rights activists and members of the Communist Party USA in the 1940s. He attended Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, where he worked as circulation and exchange manager for the school&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Silver Chips&quot;. He began his journalism career at the age of 16 when he became a copyboy for &quot;The Washington Star&quot; and moved &quot;quickly through the ranks&quot;. The &quot;Star&quot;, however, unofficially required a college degree to write for the paper.

At the University of Maryland, College Park, he was a reporter for the school&#x27;s independent daily, &quot;The Diamondback&quot;. However, Bernstein was dismissed from the university after the fall 1964 semester for bad grades.

In 1965, Bernstein left the &quot;Star&quot; to become a full-time reporter for the &quot;Elizabeth Daily Journal&quot; in New Jersey. While there, he won first prize in New Jersey&#x27;s press association for investigative reporting, feature writing, and news on a deadline. In 1966, Bernstein left New Jersey and began reporting for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he covered every aspect of local news and became known as one of the paper&#x27;s best writing stylists.

==Watergate==

On a Saturday in June 1972, Bernstein was assigned, along with Bob Woodward, to cover a break-in at the Watergate office complex that had occurred earlier the same morning. Five burglars had been caught red-handed in the complex, where the Democratic National Committee had its headquarters; four of them turned out to be ex-CIA agents who did security work for the Republicans. In the series of stories that followed, Bernstein and Woodward eventually connected the burglars to a massive slush fund and a corrupt attorney general. Bernstein was the first to suspect that President Nixon was involved, and he found a laundered check that linked Nixon to the burglary. Bernstein and Woodward&#x27;s discoveries led to further investigations of Nixon, and on August 9, 1974, amid hearings by the House Judiciary Committee, Nixon resigned to avoid facing impeachment.

In 1974, two years after the Watergate burglary and two months before Nixon resigned, Bernstein and Woodward released the book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;. The book drew upon the notes and research accumulated while writing articles about the scandal for the &quot;Post&quot; and &quot;remained on best-seller lists for six months&quot;. In 1975, it was turned into a movie starring Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein and Robert Redford as Woodward which later went on to be nominated in multiple Oscar (including Best Picture nomination), Golden Globe and BAFTA categories. A second book, &quot;The Final Days&quot;, was published by Bernstein and Woodward in 1976 as a follow-up chronicling Nixon&#x27;s last days in office.

==After Watergate==
Bernstein left the &quot;Post&quot; in 1977 and expanded into other areas due to his reputation from the Watergate reporting. He joined broadcast news in a high growth period. He worked at ABC, CNN, and CBS as a political commentator, and was a spokesman in various television commercials. He began investigating the secret cooperation between the CIA and American media during the Cold War. He spent a year in his research, which was published as a 25,000-word article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

He then began working for ABC News. Between 1980 and 1984, Bernstein was the network&#x27;s Washington Bureau Chief and then a senior correspondent. In 1982, for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, Bernstein was the first to report during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon that Ariel Sharon had &quot;deceived the cabinet about the real intention of the operation—to drive the Palestinians out of Lebanon, not (as he had claimed) to merely establish a 25-kilometer security zone north from the border&quot;.

Two years after leaving ABC News, Bernstein released the book &quot;Loyalties: A Son&#x27;s Memoir&quot;, in which he revealed that his parents had been members of the Communist Party of America. The assertion shocked some because even J. Edgar Hoover had tried and been unable to prove that Bernstein&#x27;s parents had been party members.

In 1992, for &quot;Time&quot;, Bernstein wrote a cover story publicizing the alliance between Pope John Paul II and President Ronald Reagan. Later, along with Vatican expert Marco Politi, he published a papal biography entitled &quot;His Holiness&quot;. Bernstein wrote in the 1996 book that the Pope&#x27;s role in supporting Solidarity in his native Poland, and his geopolitical dexterity combined with enormous spiritual influence, was a principal factor in the downfall of communism in Europe.

In 1992, Bernstein wrote a cover story for &quot;The New Republic&quot; magazine indicting modern journalism for its sensationalism and celebration of gossip over real news. The article was entitled &quot;The Idiot Culture&quot;.

Bernstein&#x27;s biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton, &quot;A Woman In Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton&quot;, was published by Alfred A. Knopf on June 5, 2007. Knopf had a first printing of 275,000 copies. It appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for three weeks. A CBS News end-of-year survey of publishing &quot;hits and misses&quot; included &quot;A Woman in Charge&quot; in the &quot;miss&quot; category and implied that its total sales were somewhere in the range of perhaps 55,000–65,000 copies.

Bernstein is a frequent guest and analyst on television news programs, and in 2011 wrote articles for &quot;Newsweek&quot;/&quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, comparing Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot; phone-hacking scandal to Watergate.

In 2012, Carl Bernstein spoke at a rally of the People&#x27;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, saying he attended as an advocate &quot;who believes in basic human rights&quot; and that &quot;the evil, the terrorism, the real terrorism, is in the heart of Tehran, not in this room&quot;.

On CNN in 2024, Bernstein reported that President Biden had 15 to 20 incidents of cognitive decline in early 2024, increasing media calls for Biden to drop out before he did shortly after.

==Personal life==

Bernstein has been married three times, first to a fellow reporter at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Carol Honsa; then to writer and director Nora Ephron from 1976 to 1980; and since 2003 to the former model Christine Kuehbeck.

During his marriage to Ephron, Bernstein met Margaret Jay, daughter of British Prime Minister James Callaghan and wife of Peter Jay, then UK ambassador to the United States. They had a much-publicized extramarital relationship in 1979. Margaret later became a government minister in her own right. Bernstein and second wife Ephron already had an infant son, Jacob, and she was pregnant with their second son, Max, in 1979 when she learned of her husband&#x27;s affair with Jay. Ephron delivered Max prematurely after finding out. Ephron was inspired by the events to write the 1983 novel &quot;Heartburn&quot;, which was made into a 1986 film starring Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson.

While single, in the 1980s, Bernstein became known for dating Bianca Jagger, Martha Stewart, and Elizabeth Taylor, among others.

==Portrayals==
Bernstein was portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film version of &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; and by Bruce McCulloch in the 1999 comedy film &quot;Dick&quot;. In Nora Ephron&#x27;s &quot;Heartburn&quot;, a 1986 semi-autobiographical comedy/drama, Jack Nicholson played Mark Forman, a character based on Carl Bernstein.

==Differences between Bernstein and Woodward==
Although they worked together to report the Watergate scandal to the world, Bernstein and Woodward had very different personalities. Raised in a traditional Republican household, Woodward was very well-educated and has been described as gentle. After graduating from Yale University, he joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot;; nine months later, he was assigned the Watergate break-in story. On the other hand, Bernstein was born to a Communist Jewish family. He was rebellious, which led to him failing out of college. He was ten months further along in his career than Woodward when the scandal broke out.
They were also different in work styles. Woodward&#x27;s strength was in investigation, so he focused on investigating the Watergate scandal. He met his Deep Throat source secretly to get as much information as possible. His writing was serious and matter-of-fact. However, Bernstein was the first of the pair to think that the Watergate case could be related to President Richard Nixon. Compared to Woodward, Bernstein was a strong writer, and therefore wrote articles based on Woodward&#x27;s information from Deep Throat. Due to their different styles, other journalists described them as a perfect team. Alicia Shepard said, &quot;Carl was the big thinker, and Woodward was the one that [made] sure it got done ... [T]hey knew that each of them had strengths that the other didn&#x27;t, and they relied on one another.&quot;

<text>Sanctuary Records Group Limited was a record label based in the United Kingdom and is, as of 2013, a subsidiary of BMG Rights Management solely for reissues. Until June 2007, it was the largest independent record label in the UK and the largest music management company in the world. It was also the world&#x27;s largest independent owner of music intellectual property rights, with over 160,000 songs.

==History==
The company was formed in 1979 by Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor, who met as undergraduates at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1979, they discovered Iron Maiden in a London pub and went on to manage the group. They named the record company after the band&#x27;s song &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; which was released as a single in 1980, and later included on American pressings as well as the reissued CD version of their 1980 eponymous debut album.

Sanctuary Records has historically signed artists with long-term appeal that have had a long career and steady fan base.

Between 1989 and 1991, Sanctuary was co-owned by the Zomba Group, whose music publishing arm still held the music of Iron Maiden in 2001.

In 1994, the company diversified. Amongst the new media interests included a joint venture with screenwriter and producer, Raymond Thompson, which evolved into the Cloud9 Screen Entertainment Group.

Iron Maiden&#x27;s catalogue was re-issued by Sanctuary in conjunction with Columbia/SME Records in the US in 2002.

Kenny Rogers&#x27; 1980s catalogue (originally released on RCA Records) was re-issued by Sanctuary&#x27;s Castle Music label in conjunction with Kenny Rogers&#x27; Dreamcatcher Records in the UK. The albums were only available as imports in the US. Rogers&#x27; 2003 release &quot;Back to the Well&quot; was released by Sanctuary in the UK.

Mayan Records was an imprint of Sanctuary Records, under which Lordi&#x27;s UK album &quot;The Monster Show&quot; was released.

Sanctuary&#x27;s notable twentieth anniversary release of &quot;CD86: 48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop&quot;, was released in 2006; it is a reissue of the pivotal UK independent compilation &quot;C86&quot;.

The company incurred significant losses in its 2004 and 2005 fiscal years. Sanctuary&#x27;s losses in 2005 increased to £142.6m from £26.7m in 2004. In October 2005, the company announced that one quarter of its staff, representing 175 positions, would be eliminated. One such layoff was John Kalodner, senior vice-president of A&amp;R, with over thirty years of industry experience.

The company partly blamed the loss increase on record release delays, while announcing, in early 2006, a £110m rescue deal. These events, plus pressure from the UK financial and business leaders led to Smallwood becoming merely a general manager of the company, Taylor becoming Chief Executive and former British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling being installed as the new chairman. On 26 May 2006, Ayling dismissed Taylor, following a review of accounting practices prompted by inquiries from the Financial Reporting Review Panel. The board&#x27;s publicly stated reason for the dismissal was &quot;that certain of the prior year adjustments made in the 2005 accounts should have been presented as a correction of fundamental errors and not as changes in accounting policy&quot;. Taylor was replaced by Frank Presland, the chief executive of Sanctuary-owned Twenty-First Artists Management.

In July 2006, it was reported that MAMA, the management group behind the Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand and headed by Mean Fiddler chief Dean James, had bid for the group. This proved unsuccessful, further depressing the share value of the company. In late 2006, Rod Smallwood left the company, taking with him Iron Maiden&#x27;s management interests.
In April 2007, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that Sanctuary Records would cease to exist as a new release label in the US that summer, though catalogue, licensing, and new media operations would continue. On 15 June 2007 Universal Music Group announced it had reached an agreement to buy Sanctuary Records for £44.5 million. The agreement was completed in October 2007. By December 2007, it appeared that the Sanctuary name had begun to be phased out, with both Morrissey and Robert Plant being transferred to the Universal-owned Decca Music Group and Iron Maiden to Universal Music Enterprises (with distribution by Sony Music Entertainment, a successor to Sanctuary and Columbia&#x27;s distribution partnership for the band&#x27;s releases) for future releases.

On 21 September 2012, regulators approved Universal Music Group&#x27;s planned acquisition of EMI from Citibank for £1.2 billion. However, due to conditions imposed by the European Commission, UMG was required to sell Sanctuary. It was one of the two units of Universal Music, never fully owned by EMI, that were forced to be sold; the other unit was V2 Records. BMG Rights Management acquired Sanctuary for over €46 million. In June 2013, BMG agreed to have INgrooves distribute the label&#x27;s catalogue in North America, while the PIAS Group would handle international rights; however, Black Sabbath&#x27;s catalogue remained at Universal until March 2014, when BMG took over the band&#x27;s distribution. In March 2017, BMG transferred the distribution rights of select Sanctuary artists to Warner Music Group&#x27;s ADA division.

In 2023, BMG signed a new distribution deal with Universal Music Group, Sanctuary&#x27;s previous owner.

<text>Gauteng ( , ; Sotho-Tswana for &#x27;place of gold&#x27;; or ) is one of the nine provinces of South Africa.

Situated on the Highveld, Gauteng is the smallest province by land area in South Africa. Although Gauteng accounts for only 1.5% of the country&#x27;s land area, it is the most populous province in South Africa, with more than a quarter (26%) of the national population; the provincial population was approximately 16.1 million, according to mid-year 2022 estimates. Highly urbanised, the province contains the country&#x27;s largest city, Johannesburg. Gauteng is the wealthiest province in South Africa and is considered the financial hub of South Africa; the financial activity is mostly concentrated in Johannesburg. It also contains the administrative capital, Pretoria, and other large areas such as Midrand, Vanderbijlpark, Ekurhuleni and the affluent Sandton. The largest township, Soweto, is also found in this province. Politically, it is the closest contested province between the ANC and the DA in South Africa.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gauteng&quot; is derived from Sotho-Tswana , meaning &#x27;gold&#x27;. There was a thriving gold industry in the province following the 1886 discovery of gold in Johannesburg. In Sesotho, Setswana and Sepedi the name was used for Johannesburg and surrounding areas long before it was adopted in 1994 as the official name of the province.

==History==

Gauteng was formed from part of the old Transvaal Province after South Africa&#x27;s first multiracial elections on 27 April 1994. It was initially called Pretoria–Witwatersrand–Vereeniging (PWV) and was renamed &quot;Gauteng&quot; on the 28th of June 1995, the same day two other provinces were renamed. The term &quot;PWV&quot; describing the region existed long before the establishment of a province by that name, with the &quot;V&quot; sometimes standing for &quot;Vaal Triangle&quot; rather than Vereeniging.

At the Sterkfontein caves, some of the oldest fossils of hominids have been discovered, such as Mrs. Ples and Little Foot.

Events in this area were not written down until the 19th century; information from before that time is lost or difficult to confirm. The first records are from the early 19th century, when settlers originating from the Cape Colony defeated chief Mzilikazi and started establishing villages in the area.

The city of Pretoria, established in 1855 as the capital of the South African Republic, witnessed rapid growth until the discovery of gold in the Witswatersrand area in 1886, which led to the founding of Johannesburg. Despite slower development compared to Johannesburg, Pretoria maintained significance, notably due to its pivotal role in the Second Boer War. The nearby town of Cullinan gained international acclaim in 1905 when the largest diamond ever discovered, the Cullinan Diamond, was mined there.

Many events crucial to the anti-apartheid struggle happened in present-day Gauteng, such as the Freedom Charter of 1955, Women&#x27;s March of 1956, Sharpeville massacre of 1960, the Rivonia Trial of 1963 and 1964, the little Rivonia Trial of 1964, the Soweto Uprising of 1976 and Sharpeville Six of 1984. The Apartheid Museum documents this era.

==Law and government==
Gauteng is governed by the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, a 73-person unicameral legislature elected by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects one of its members as Premier of Gauteng to lead the executive, and the Premier appoints an Executive Council of up to 10 members of the legislature to serve as heads of the various government departments. The provincial government is responsible for the topics allocated to it in the national constitution, including such fields as basic education, health, housing, social services, agriculture and environmental protection.

The most recent election of the provincial legislature was held on 8 May 2019, and the African National Congress (ANC) won 50.19% of the vote and a 37-seat majority in the legislature. The official opposition is the Democratic Alliance, which won 27.45% of the vote and 20 seats. Other parties represented are the Economic Freedom Fighters with eleven seats and the Freedom Front Plus with three seats. The Inkatha Freedom Party and African Christian Democratic Party hold one seat each. Premier David Makhura of the ANC was re-elected as premier on 22 May 2019, at the first meeting of the legislature after the general election. Makhura resigned from the position on 6 October 2022 and Panyaza Lesufi of the ANC was elected to replace him. In the 2024 South African general election, held on 29 May, the ANC received 34% of the vote, while the DA received 28%.

The Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa, which has seats in Pretoria and Johannesburg, is a superior court with general jurisdiction over the province. Johannesburg is also home to the Constitutional Court, South Africa&#x27;s highest court, and to a branch of the Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court.

== Geography ==

Gauteng&#x27;s southern border is the Vaal River, which separates it from the Free State. It also borders on North West to the west, Limpopo to the north, and Mpumalanga to the east. Gauteng is the only landlocked province of South Africa without a foreign border. Most of Gauteng is on the Highveld, a high-altitude grassland (circa above sea level). Between Johannesburg and Pretoria, there are low parallel ridges and undulating hills, some part of the Magaliesberg Mountains and the Witwatersrand. The north of the province is more subtropical, due to its lower altitude and is mostly dry savanna habitat.

===Witwatersrand area===

In the southern half of Gauteng, the Witwatersrand area is an older term describing a 120 km wide oblong-shaped conurbation from Randfontein in the West to Nigel in the East, named after the Witwatersrand, a geologically and economically important series of low ridges and their associated plateau that greater Johannesburg developed on. This area is also often referred to simply as &quot;Witwatersrand&quot;, &quot;the Rand&quot; or &quot;the Reef&quot; (archaic, after the gold reefs that precipitated the development of the area), and was the &quot;W&quot; in &quot;PWV&quot;, the initial name for Gauteng. It has traditionally been divided into the three areas of East Rand (governed by the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality), Central Rand (approximately today&#x27;s Johannesburg Municipality) and West Rand.

===Climate===
The climate is mostly influenced by altitude. Even though the province is at a subtropical latitude, the climate is comparatively cooler, especially in Johannesburg, at above sea level (Pretoria is at ). Most precipitation occurs as brief afternoon thunderstorms; however, relative humidity never becomes uncomfortable. Winters are crisp and dry with frost occurring often in the southern areas. Snow is rare, but it has occurred on some occasions in the Johannesburg metropolitan area.

Thomas Brinkhoff lists a &quot;Consolidated Urban Area&quot; in Gauteng as having a population of 13.1 million . The future governmental plans for the region indicate the gradual urbanisation and consolidation towards the creation of a megalopolis that connects these metros. The GCRO is a collaboration between the Universities of Johannesburg and Witwatersrand, the city of Johannesburg, Gauteng Provincial Government, and SALGA-Gauteng. The GCRO&#x27;s purpose is to collect information and create a database on the Gauteng City Region to provide to government, lawmakers and civil society an informed understanding of the fastest urbanizing region in Southern Africa.

== Economy ==

Gauteng is considered the economic hub of South Africa and contributes heavily in the financial, manufacturing, transport, technology, and telecommunications sectors, among others. It also plays host to a large number of overseas companies requiring a commercial base in and gateway to Africa.

Gauteng is home to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the largest stock exchange in Africa. Some of the largest companies in Africa and abroad are based in Gauteng, or have offices and branches there, such as Vodacom, MTN, Neotel, Microsoft South Africa and the largest Porsche Centre in the world.

Although Gauteng is the smallest of South Africa&#x27;s nine provinces—it covers a mere 1.5% of the country&#x27;s total land area, the province is responsible for a third of South Africa&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). Gauteng generates about 10% of the total GDP of sub-Saharan Africa and about 7% of total African GDP. Gauteng has the highest GDP and GDP per capita of all South Africa&#x27;s provinces. Gauteng is also the province with the most taxpayers and the highest average taxable income per taxpayer according to the South African Revenue Service.

==Transport==

SANRAL, a parastatal, is responsible for the maintenance, development and management of all national road networks in South Africa. SANRAL is responsible for instituting the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project, which was met with a lot of opposition due to the tolling of Gauteng motorists. Many important national routes run through Gauteng such as the N1, N3, N4, N12, N14 and the N17. Johannesburg is quite dependent on freeways for transport in and around the city. The R21, R24, R59, M1 and M2 all run through Johannesburg while the R80 connects Pretoria Central to Soshanguve.
The Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project led to a large decrease in traffic congestion when construction finished 2011–2012. Cape Town, for the first time in decades, is now the most congested city in South Africa.

PUTCO, the largest commuter bus operator in South Africa, services the Gauteng area extensively. The bus rapid transit system Rea Vaya also serves to transport people from Johannesburg&#x27;s southern neighbourhoods into and around the CBD. In an interview, Parks Tau stated that by 2040, Johannesburg will be dominated by pedestrians and public transport as opposed to the use of private transport or informal transport, such as minibus taxis.

Gautrain and Metrorail both service the province&#x27;s public transport sector where trains are concerned and Gautrain offers a bus service that transports commuters to and from various train stations and predetermined bus stops. Metrorail trains are considered one of the most cost-effective methods of transportation in and around Gauteng.

The O. R. Tambo International Airport, Rand Airport, Lanseria International Airport, Wonderboom Airport and Grand Central Airport are located in Gauteng.

There is a large informal transport sector in Gauteng, consisting of thousands of minibus taxis, which many of the urban and rural population makes use of. However, it is noted that taxis are often unsafe as their drivers ignore the rules of the road and the vehicles are often not roadworthy. The City of Johannesburg stated that: &quot;major initiatives are under way to completely reform the taxi industry and provide more comfort and safety to customers.&quot; In March 2017, it is reported that Gauteng alone has 4,7 million registered vehicles under the &quot;GP&quot; abbreviation via the eNatis system.

== Education ==

Gauteng is a large center of learning in South Africa, and it has many universities and educational institutions of higher learning.

===Universities===

University South Africa Campus
* Tshwane University of Technology
* University of Johannesburg
* Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University
* University of Pretoria
* University of South Africa

* Vaal University of Technology

===Colleges===
In 2002, the Gauteng Department of Education founded an initiative called &quot;Gauteng Online&quot; in an attempt to get the entire province to utilize a wide assortment of electronic and telecommunications systems. In 2007, this initiative was handed over to the Gauteng Department of Finance.

In the 2013 national budget speech, it was announced that the Gauteng Department of Education would be granted over R700 million to improve education and to alleviate issues concerning the overcrowding in schools, a shortage in teaching staff and transport for poor pupils.

In 2017/2018, the Gauteng Provincial government spent R42.4 billion on education which accounted for 38% the province&#x27;s total expenditure.

== Conservation ==
Although Gauteng province is dominated by the urban areas of Johannesburg and Pretoria, it has several nature reserves. Gauteng is home to the Cradle of Humankind UNESCO World Heritage Site which includes the Sterkfontein caves and the Wonder Cave Kromdraai. Johannesburg is home to the largest human-made urban forest in the world.

== Sport ==
Gauteng is home to many stadiums and sporting grounds, notably Soccer City, Ellis Park Stadium, Odi Stadium, Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Lucas Moripe Stadium, Giant Stadium, Orlando Stadium, Johannesburg Stadium, the Wanderers Stadium and SuperSport Park.

Several teams from Gauteng play in the country&#x27;s top-level association football (more commonly referred to as soccer) league, the Premiership, including Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. The national squad Bafana Bafana&#x27;s home stadium is Soccer City in Johannesburg. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the first ever world cup held by an African nation, Gauteng&#x27;s stadia hosted many games. The first ever FIFA world cup match on African soil took place at Soccer City on 11 June 2010. Along with Soccer City, Loftus Versfeld Stadium and Ellis Park Stadium hosted matches in Gauteng.

Rugby, or more accurately rugby union, is a popular sport in South Africa, and in Gauteng in particular. Two rugby teams from Gauteng participate in the Southern Hemisphere Super Rugby championship: the Pretoria-based Bulls, and the Johannesburg-based Lions (previously the Cats). Three Gauteng-based teams play in the country&#x27;s domestic competition, the Currie Cup: the Blue Bulls from Pretoria, the Golden Lions from Johannesburg and the Falcons from the East Rand. In 1995, South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup and proceeded to win the tournament at Ellis Park Stadium on 24 June 1995. The events surrounding the world cup formed the basis of the story for the movie Invictus.

Many South African universities take part in the Varsity Rugby league. Of these, the Gauteng universities include the University of Pretoria, the University of Johannesburg and the University of the Witwatersrand.

Cricket is also widely popular among all cultural groups in the country, and is the only sport to feature in the top two among all of South Africa&#x27;s major ethnic/racial groups. The Highveld Lions represent both Gauteng and North West in the country&#x27;s three domestic competitions—the first-class SuperSport Series, the List A one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Standard Bank Pro 20 Series.

Many marathons take place in Gauteng, such as the Gauteng Marathon, the Arwyp Medical Centre 15 km Nite Race and the Trisport Joburg City Triathlon.

Gauteng&#x27;s favourable weather conditions throughout the year make it an ideal hub for sports and other out door activities. This makes golf, horse racing and swimming very popular. The Vaal River facilitates water sports in the forms of jet skiing, water skiing and motor boating. Adventure sports are also quite popular in Gauteng, particularly skydiving, paragliding and hang-gliding.

The amusement park Gold Reef City is situated in Gauteng, as is the Johannesburg Zoo and the Pretoria Zoo. Botanical gardens in the province include the Pretoria and Walter Sisulu national botanical gardens maintained by the South African National Botanical Institute as well as the Johannesburg and Manie van der Schijff botanical gardens.

The Ticketpro Dome and the Gallagher Convention Centre, which are both popular events and expos venues, are also located within Gauteng. The province also has a Formula One racetrack, the Kyalami Circuit. The most recent F1 race at the venue was in 1993.

Gauteng is home to some of South Africa’s most successful sports teams, including Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, Mamelodi Sundowns (football), the Lions (rugby), and the Titans (cricket). The province regularly hosts major sporting events such as the Soweto Derby, the Comrades Marathon, and international cricket and rugby matches at stadiums like FNB Stadium and Wanderers.

Local media extensively covers Gauteng’s sporting landscape, including Gauteng News, which provides news, match analysis, and coverage of community-level sports and major tournaments in the province.

<doc id="309664" wikidata="Q1140228" url="?curid=309664" title="Fog of war">
<text>The fog of war () is the uncertainty in situational awareness experienced by participants in military operations. The term seeks to capture the uncertainty regarding one&#x27;s own capability, adversary capability, and adversary intent during an engagement, operation, or campaign. Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through military intelligence and friendly force tracking systems.

The term has become commonly used to define uncertainty mechanics in wargames.

== Origin ==
The word &quot;fog&quot; (), but not the exact phrase, in reference to &#x27;uncertainty in war&#x27; was introduced by the Prussian military analyst Carl von Clausewitz in his posthumously published book, &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; (1832), the English translation of which was published as &quot;On War&quot; (1873):

It has been pointed out that von Clausewitz does not use the exact phrase &quot;fog of war&quot;, and also uses multiple similar metaphors, such as &quot;twilight&quot; and &quot;moonlight&quot;, to describe a &#x27;lack of clarity&#x27;. 

The first known use of the exact phrase in text dates to 1836 in a poem entitled &quot;The Battle of Bunker Hill&quot; by McDonald Clarke. The poem describes an assault by British forces upon an American redoubt during the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill: 

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Will they dare a third attack? 
Is a question seen in every eye; 
Old Put across the neck and back,
Rides slowly, their vengeance to defy—
Wildy, in that deadly hour, 
The Ramparts shove their bolted shower, 
While mid the waving fog of war, 
Thunders the Yankee’s loud hurrah&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The first known attempt to explicitly define the &quot;fog of war&quot; in a military text was made in 1896 in a book titled &quot;The Fog of War&quot; by Sir Lonsdale Augustus Hale, where it is described as &quot;the state of ignorance in which commanders frequently find themselves as regards the real strength and position, not only of their foes, but also of their friends.&quot;

== Military ==

The fog of war is a reality in all military conflict. Precision and certainty are unattainable goals, but modern military doctrine suggests a trade-off of precision and certainty for speed and agility. Militaries employ command and control (C2) systems and doctrine to partially alleviate the fog of war.

The term also applies to the experience of individual soldiers in battle: often cited is the pure confusion of direction, location, and perspective on a battlefield. Officers and soldiers become separated, orders become confused and subject to revision with poor communication. Sounds and vision are limited from the perspective of the individual and may not be easily resolved, resulting in a continuing uncertainty, a perceptual &quot;fog&quot;.

The fog of war has been decreasing as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology is improving. In 2016, Chief of Staff of the United States Army Gen. Mark A. Milley stated that &quot;On the future battlefield, if you stay in one place longer than two or three hours, you will be dead... With enemy drones and sensors constantly on the hunt for targets, there won&#x27;t even be time for four hours&#x27; unbroken sleep.&quot;

== Simulations and games ==

Abstract and military board games sometimes try to capture the effect of the fog of war by hiding the identity of playing pieces, by keeping them face down or turned away from the opposing player (as in &quot;Stratego&quot;) or covered (as in &quot;Squad Leader&quot;). Other games, such as the Dark chess and &quot;Kriegspiel&quot; chess-variants, playing pieces could be hidden from the players by using a duplicate, hidden game board.

Another version of fog of war emulation is used by block wargaming where, much like &quot;Stratego&quot;, the blocks face each player, hiding their value. However, this also allows for incremental damage, where the block is rotated up to four times to indicate battle damage before the unit is eliminated from the playing field.

Solitaire games also by their nature attempt to recreate fog of war using random dice rolls or card draws to determine events. Complex double-blind miniature wargames, including military simulations, may make use of two identical maps or model landscapes, one or more referees providing limited intelligence to the opposing sides, participants in the roles of sub-unit leaders, and the use of radio sets or intercoms.

=== In video games ===

A computer&#x27;s ability to effectively hide information from a player is seen as a distinct advantage over board games when simulating war. Fog of war in strategy video games refers to enemy units, and often terrain, being hidden from the player; this is lifted once the area is explored, but the information is often fully or partially re-hidden whenever the player does not have a unit in that area.

The earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game &quot;Empire&quot; by Walter Bright. Another early use of fog of war was the 1978 game &quot;Tanktics&quot; designed by Chris Crawford, which was criticized for its unreliable and &quot;confusing&quot; fog of war system. Crawford, in 1982, suggested &quot;limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player&quot; to compensate for the computer&#x27;s lack of intelligence. In a 1988 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; article Dave Arneson called fog of war &quot;one of the biggest &#x27;plus&#x27; factors in computer simulations&quot;, while Crawford concluded, using &quot;Tanktics&quot; as an example, that video game fog of war systems became less &quot;fun&quot; the more realistic they were, leading the medium to instead use simplified systems.

Two large Blizzard franchises, &quot;Warcraft&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot;, use a fog of war which only reveals terrain features and enemy units through a player&#x27;s reconnaissance. Without a unit actively observing, previously revealed areas of the map are subject to a shroud through which only terrain is visible, but changes in enemy units or bases are not. This is also common in both turn-based and real-time strategy games, such as &quot;League of Legends&quot;, the &quot;Close Combat&quot; series, &quot;Total War&quot; series, &quot;Age of Empires&quot; series, &quot;Red Alert&quot; series, &quot;Advance Wars&quot; series, &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, Sid Meier&#x27;s &quot;Civilization&quot; series, &quot;Supreme Commander&quot; series and the XCOM series.

Fog of war gives players an incentive to uncover a game&#x27;s world. A compulsion to reveal obscured parts of a map has been described to give a sense of exploring the unknown. Crawford said that &quot;reasonable&quot; uses of fog of war, such as needing to send out scouts, &quot;not only seem natural, but ... add to the realism and excitement of the game&quot; &quot;Merchant Prince&quot; displays over unexplored territory what &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described as a &quot;renaissance-style map of dubious accuracy&quot;. In some strategy games that make use of fog of war, enemy AI may have knowledge of the positions of all other units and buildings on the map regardless, to compensate for lack of true intelligence, which players may consider as cheating if discovered. A designer may use fog of war to keep a game that has become impossible to win enjoyable, by hiding this fact from the player.

<text>The Coral Sea () is a marginal sea of the South Pacific off the northeast coast of Australia, and classified as an interim Australian bioregion. The Coral Sea extends down the Australian northeast coast. Most of it is protected by the French Natural Park of the Coral Sea () and the Australian Coral Sea Marine Park. The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia.

The sea contains numerous islands and reefs, as well as the world&#x27;s largest reef system, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1981. All previous oil exploration projects were terminated at the GBR in 1975, and fishing is restricted in many areas. The reefs and islands of the Coral Sea are particularly rich in birds and aquatic life and are a popular tourist destination, both domestically and internationally.

==Geography==
It is bounded in the west by the east coast of Queensland, thereby including the Great Barrier Reef, in the east by Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) and by New Caledonia, and in the northeast approximately by the southern extremity of the Solomon Islands. In the northwest, it reaches to the south coast of eastern New Guinea, thereby including the Gulf of Papua. It merges with the Tasman Sea in the south, with the Solomon Sea in the north and with the Pacific Ocean in the east. On the west, it is bounded by the mainland coast of Queensland, and in the northwest, it connects with the Arafura Sea through the Torres Strait.

The sea is characterised by its warm climate, with frequent rains and tropical cyclones.

==Extent==

While the Great Barrier Reef with its islands and cays belong to Queensland, most reefs and islets east of it are part of the Coral Sea Islands Territory. In addition, some islands west of and belonging to New Caledonia are also part of the Coral Sea Islands in a geographical sense, such as the Chesterfield Islands and Bellona Reefs.

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Coral Sea as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; The South coast of New Guinea from the entrance to the Bensbach River (141°01&#x27;E) to Gadogadoa Island near its Southeastern extreme (), down this meridian to the 100 fathom line and thence along the Southern edges of Uluma Reef and those extending to the Eastward as far as the Southeast point of Lawik Reef () off Tagula Island, thence a line to the Southern extreme of Rennell Island (Solomon Islands) and from its Eastern point to Cape Surville, the Eastern extreme of San Cristobal Island [Makira], Solomons; thence through Nupani Island, the Northwestern of the Santa Cruz Islands () to the Northernmost Island of the Duff Islands ().

&quot;On the Northeast.&quot; From the Northernmost island of the Duff Islands, through these islands to their Southeastern extreme, thence a line to Méré Lava, Vanuatu Islands() and down the Eastern coasts of the islands of this Group to Anatom Island () in such a way that all the islands of these Groups, and the straits separating them, are included in the Coral Sea.

&quot;On the Southeast.&quot; A line from the Southeastern extreme of Anatom Island to Nokanhoui (reefs) () off the Southeast extreme of New Caledonia, thence through the East point of Middleton Reef to the Eastern extreme of Elizabeth Reef () and down this meridian to Latitude 30° South.

&quot;On the South.&quot; The parallel of 30° South to the Australian coast. (Bordering the Tasman Sea.)

&quot;On the West.&quot; The Eastern limit of the Arafura Sea [The entrance to the Bensbach River (141°01&#x27;E), and thence a line to the Northwest extreme of York Peninsula, Australia ()] and the East Coast of Australia as far south as Latitude 30° South.
==Geology==

The fairly deep Coral Sea basin was formed between 58 million and 48 million years ago when the Queensland continental shelf was uplifted, forming the Great Dividing Range, and continental blocks subsided at the same time. The sea has been an important source of coral for the Great Barrier Reef, both during its formation and after sea level lowering.

The geological formation processes are still proceeding, as partly evidenced by the seismic activity. Several hundred earthquakes with the magnitude between 2 and 6 were recorded in the period 1866–2000 along the Queensland coast and in the Coral Sea. However this seismic activity is much less than to the east or north of the sea, and most of the area under the sea can be regarded as now tectonically inactive except for sedimentation. On 2 April 2007, the Solomon Islands were struck by a major earthquake followed by a several metres tall tsunami. The epicentre of this magnitude earthquake was northwest of Honiara, at a depth of . It was followed by more than 44 aftershocks of a magnitude 5.0 or greater. The resulting tsunami killed at least 52 people and destroyed more than 900 homes.

The sea received its name because of its numerous coral formations. They include the Great Barrier Reef, which extends about along the northeast coast of Australia and includes approximately 2,900 individual reefs and 1000 islands. The Chesterfield Islands and Lihou Reef are the largest atolls of the Coral Sea.

===Topography===
To the east of the north Australian coast is the Great Barrier Reef on the continental shelf. To its east is a plateau that is host to the Coral Sea Islands Territory that is known as either the Coral Sea Plateau or the Queensland Plateau. To the north of the Great Barrier Reef the Eastern and Papuan Plateaus continue the southern continental shelf of New Guinea. The Coral Sea Basin, while being the main oceanic basin of the sea, is associated with much more geologically complex and younger basins situated to the seas&#x27;s east and south. It is separated to the east from these younger basins by the Louisiade Plateau. To the east of the Louisiade Plateau is what has been named geologically as the Rennell Basin, south-west of Rennell Island, but is gazetted as being known as either the Rennell or Rennel Trough. To the east of this Rennell Basin is the Rennell Island Ridge (Rennel Island Ridge) which contains both Rennell Island and the Indispensable Reefs. To the southeast of the Rennell Island Ridge is the South Rennell Trough, quite a deep spreading center linear structure extending from northeast to southwest extending along the south east border of the Mellish Rise. The main eastern basins are the north the Santa Cruz Basin and to its south the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Basin which is delimited to its south by the undersea D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Ridge. South of the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Ridge is the North Loyalty Basin (gazetted as the Loyalty Basin as an alternative name), which is bordered on its southwest by the Loyalty Ridge that contains the Loyalty Islands. This ridge is the north east border of the submerged continent of Zealandia and all the structures on the sea floor of the Coral Sea to its south east are related to this area of continental crust. In turn going to the south west they are the South Loyalty Basin, the New Caledonia Nappe, the New Caledonia Trough (previously known as the New Caledonia Basin) and to its south west the Bellona Plateau.

==Hydrology==

Major Coral Sea currents form a counter-clockwise gyro which includes the East Australian Current. It brings warm nutrient-poor waters from the Coral Sea down the east coast of Australia to the cool waters of the Tasman Sea. This current is the strongest along the Australian coasts and transforms 30 million m3/s of water within a flow band of about 100 kilometres wide and 500 metres deep. The current is strongest around February and weakest around August.

The major river flowing into the sea is the Burdekin River, which has its delta southeast of Townsville. Owing to the seasonal and annual variations in occurrence of cyclones and in precipitation (typically between 200 and 1600 mm/year), its annual discharge can vary more than 10 times between the two succeeding years. In particular, in the period 1920–1999, the average flow rate near the delta was below 1000 m3/s in 1923, 1931, 1939, 1969, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1993 and 1995; it was above 25,000 m3/s in 1927, 1940, 1946, 1950, 1951, 1959, 1968, 1972, 1974 and 1991, and reached about 40,000 m3/s in 1946. This irregularity results in concomitant fluctuations of the sea water composition near the river delta.

The surface water temperature varies on the south of the sea from 19 °C in August to 24 °C in February. It is rather warm and stable at 27–28 °С in the north all through the year. Water salinity is 34.5–35.5‰ (parts per thousand). The water is mostly very clear, with the visibility of about 30 metres (100 ft) near the reefs.

==History==
The Coral Sea takes its name from its coral formations of the Great Barrier Reef, the largest known reef system in the world.

In May 1942, a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese naval units took place in the Coral Sea, which resulted in the prevention of the Japanese sea-borne invasion of Port Moresby.

==Climate==

The sea has a subtropical climate and is frequently hit by tropical cyclones, especially between January and April. This range extends to November–May in the areas south to 10°S. Between 1969 and 1997, the GBR experienced 80 cyclones, 90% which were of category 1 or 2 (winds 17–33 m/s, central pressure 970–1000 hPa) and only 10% of category 3 (winds &gt;33 m/s, pressure &lt;970 hPa). The cyclone frequency decreased between 1997 and 2005 to 1.5 per year (12 in total).

Annual rainfall typically ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 mm depending on the area. Most rains fall between December and March, in bursts of 30–60 days. The number of clear days per year varies approximately between 80 and 125, and the typical temperature variation through the year are 18–27 °C.

Climate change made it 175 times more likely that the surface waters of the Coral Sea would reach the record-breaking temperatures March 2016 that bleached reefs, modelling analysis showed.

===Winds===
Winds in the Coral Sea can be classified by season, longitude and latitude. Southeasterly trade winds dominate through all sea areas and all seasons, especially between 20°S and 25°S, west of the meridian of 155°E. However, between September and December they change to northerly and northwesterly winds in this region, and the direction is mostly southwestern in May–August. West of 155°E, gales are common between January and August and are less frequent in September–December.

In January, the northwest monsoon may occur between the parallels of 15°S and 20°S, west of the 150°E meridian. Gales are rare in this region most of the year except for June–August, when strong southeasterly winds occur a few days per month.

The southeasterly trades are also strong north of 15°S between March and November. They weaken and often change to westerly winds in December and to northerly and northwesterly winds in January
and February.

==Flora==
The Australian shore of the Coral Sea is mostly composed of sand. The GBR is too far away to provide significant coral deposits, but it effectively screens the coast from the ocean waves. As a result, most land vegetation spreads down to the sea, and the coastal waters are rich in underwater vegetation, such as green algae. The most common genera of seagrasses are &quot;Halophila&quot; and &quot;Halodule&quot;.

The islands of the GBR contain more than 2,000 plant species, and three of these are endemic. The northern islands have 300–350 plant species which tend to be woody, whereas the southern islands have 200 which are more herbaceous; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse, supporting 1,141 species. The plants are spread by birds.

==Fauna==

The sea hosts numerous species of anemones, sponges, worms (e.g. &quot;Spirobranchus giganteus&quot; shown in the photograph), gastropods, lobsters, crayfish, prawns and crabs. Red algae &quot;Lithothamnion&quot; and &quot;Porolithon&quot; colour many coral reefs purple-red and the green alga &quot;Halimeda&quot; is found throughout the sea. The coastal plants consisting of only about 30–40 species, and mangroves occur in the northern part of the sea. Four hundred coral species, both hard corals and soft corals inhabit the reefs. The majority of these spawn gametes, breeding in mass spawning events that are triggered by the rising sea temperatures of spring and summer, the lunar cycle, and the diurnal cycle. Reefs in the inner GBR spawn during the week after the full moon in October, while the outer reefs spawn in November and December. Its common soft corals belong to 36 genera. There are more than 1500 fish species in the reef systems. Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef, including thirteen species of the genus &quot;Halimeda&quot;, which deposit calcareous mounds up to wide, creating mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover.

Crown-of-thorns starfish (&quot;Acanthaster planci&quot;) is the major predator of the reefs, as it preys upon coral polyps by climbing onto them, its stomach over them, and releasing digestive enzymes to absorb the liquefied tissue. An individual adult can eat up to 6 m2 of reef per year. In 2000, an outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish contributed to a loss of 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs. Changes in water quality and overfishing of natural predators, such as the giant Triton, may have contributed to an increase in the number of crown-of-thorns starfish.

There are at least 30 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, including the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, humpback whale and dugongs. Six species of sea turtles breed on the GBR – the green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle and the olive ridley.

More than 200 species of birds (including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds) visit, nest or roost on the islands and reefs, including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern. Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the GBR, with 1.4–1.7 million birds using the sites to breed.

Seventeen species of sea snake, including &quot;Laticauda colubrina&quot; (pictured), live on the GBR in warm waters up to deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section; none of them are endemic or endangered. The venom of many of these snakes is highly toxic; for example, &quot;Aipysurus duboisii&quot; is regarded as the world&#x27;s most venomous sea snake.

There are more than 1,500 fish species, including the clownfish (Amphiprioninae), red bass (&quot;Lutjanus bohar&quot;), red-throat emperor (&quot;Lethrinus miniatus&quot;), coral trout (&quot;Plectropomus leopardus&quot;) and several species of snapper (Lutjanidae). Forty-nine species mass spawn and eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range. With a maximum total length of 0.84 cm (0.33 in), &quot;Schindleria brevipinguis&quot;, which is native to the GBR and Osprey Reef, is one of the smallest known fish and vertebrate. There are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of . Between 300 and 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef.

Saltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast. Around 125 species of shark, stingray, skates or chimaera live on the GBR, in addition to about 5,000 species of mollusc. The latter include the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails.

One study of 443 individual sharks gives the following distribution of their species on the Australian side of the Coral Sea: grey reef shark (&quot;Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos&quot;, 69%), whitetip reef shark (&quot;Triaenodon obesus&quot;, 21%), silvertip shark (&quot;Carcharhinus albimarginatus&quot;, 10%), tiger shark (&quot;Galeocerdo cuvier&quot;, &lt;1%) and great hammerhead (&quot;Sphyrna mokarran&quot;, &lt;1%). The interaction rate (free diving) at the Coral Sea reefs ranged from a few to 26 sharks per hour. The rare &quot;Etmopterus dislineatus&quot; shark species is endemic to the central part of the Coral Sea. It has been observed at depths of 590–700 m on or near the continental slope.

==Human activities==
The coastal areas of the Coral Sea were populated at least 40,000 years ago by prehistoric people descending through the northern islands. Those Aboriginal tribes have been dispersed and nowadays only about 70 groups live in the area around the GBR.

The sea was the location for the Battle of the Coral Sea, a major confrontation during World War II between the navies of the Empire of Japan, and the United States and Australia. An example is the wreckage of the &quot;USS Lexington&quot; found in 2018.

Navigation has long been a traditional human activity on the Coral Sea and there are 10 major ports on the Queensland coast alone. More than 3,500 ships operated in this area in 2007, making over 9,700 voyages that transported coal, sugar, iron ore, timber, oil, chemicals, cattle and other goods. The abundance of coral reefs hinders shipping traffic, and about 50–60 accidents per year were reported between 1990 and 2007 in the GBR alone.

Other economic activities in the sea include fishing and exploration of petroleum deposits in the Gulf of Papua. The sea is also a popular tourism destination. In 2006–2007, tourism on the GBR contributed A$5.1 billion to the Australian economy. The tourism is mostly foreign or from remote parts of Australia, with a local contribution of about A$153 million. In particular, about 14.6 million visits were made to the Coral Sea reefs by the Queensland residents over 12 months in 2008. Growing concerns over the environmental effects of tourism resulted in establishment in 1975 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. There are also smaller state and national parks. In 1981, the Great Barrier Reef was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. From the middle of 2004, approximately one-third of the GBR Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission.

It was suggested in 1923 that the Great Barrier Reef contains a major oil reservoir. After the &quot;Commonwealth Petroleum Search Subsidies Act&quot; of 1957, hydrocarbon exploration increased in Queensland, including a well drilled at Wreck Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef in 1959. In the 1960s, drilling for oil and gas was investigated throughout the Great Barrier Reef, in the Torres Strait, along &quot;the eastern seaboard of Cape York to Princess Charlotte Bay&quot; and along the coast from Cooktown to Fraser Island. In the late 1960s, more exploratory oil wells were drilled near Wreck Island in the Capricorn Channel, and near Darnley Island in the Torres Strait, but with no results. In the 1970s, responding to concern about oil spills, the Australian government forbade petroleum drilling on the GBR. Yet oil spills due to shipping accidents are still a threat to environment, with a total of 282 spills between 1987 and 2002.
Queensland has several major urban centres on the coast including Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Sunshine Coast and the industrial city of Gladstone, which inevitably contaminate the sea. About thirty rivers and hundreds of small streams add continental water, which contains sediments, pesticides and industrial waste. Runoff is especially concerning in the region south of Cairns, as it may receive up to 4200 mm of rain per year. About 90% of sea contamination originates from land farming activities. The area is continuously urbanising, so that the population is expected to increase by 40% by 2026. As a result, 70–90% of the coastal wetlands has been lost over the past decades, and many remaining flora species are endangered.

On 3 April 2010, the Chinese ship &quot;Shen Neng 1&quot; carrying 950 tonnes of oil, ran aground east of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, Australia, causing the 2010 Great Barrier Reef oil spill and inflicting the largest damage to the GBR and the Coral Sea so far. The scarred area was roughly long and wide, and some parts of it have become completely devoid of marine life. There are concerns that there could be considerable long-term damage and it will take 10 to 20 years for the reef to recover. By 13 April 2010, oil tar balls were washing up on the beaches of North West Island, a significant bird rookery and turtle nesting colony.

===Protection===
The Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve was proclaimed in December 2013, but it was not seen to offer enough protection for the environment. A group of 10 environmental NGOs came together as a coalition called the &quot;Protect our Coral Sea&quot; campaign, asking the government to create a very large highly protected Coral Sea Marine Park. In November 2011 the Australian government announced that a protected area was planned and pending approval.

The Coral Sea Commonwealth Marine Reserve was renamed as the Coral Sea Marine Park in October 2017. It covers an area of and is assigned IUCN category IV, with some area assigned IUCN categories VI, and II. It is Australia&#x27;s largest single marine park and is one of the world&#x27;s largest protected areas.

The Marine National Park protection (IUCN II) protected areas of the original 2012 announcement were subsequently significantly reduced from 50.78% to 24% in the 2018 management plan. This 50% reduction in protection was enacted contrary to the recommendations of then Commonwealth Government&#x27;s expert review panel.

==Research==
Before 2020, only shallow parts of Coral Sea reefs had been mapped. During 2020 some of the deepest parts of the sea were mapped using an advanced multi-beam sonar system aboard a research ship owned by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, after it was diverted from a Papua New Guinea deployment because of the pandemic. A robotic submarine sent back the first ever high-resolution footage and seafloor mapping of the vital marine protected area connecting the Great Barrier Reef to the Pacific Ocean. An area of was mapped, during 14 dives by the submarine, which went down up to into the depths and spent almost 100 hours in the sea. Geoscientist Jody Webster of the University of Sydney, marine geologist Robin Beaman of James Cook University led the expedition, with colleagues controlling the diving and mapping remotely. Rare marine life was identified after the images were shared with other scientists on social media, but researchers think that some of the species captured on film could be entirely new to science. Notable finds included a species of spikefish called &quot;Hollardia goslinei&quot;, previously only seen in Hawaii, and &quot;Tosanoides bennetti&quot;, first described in 2019 and never seen alive.

<doc id="309667" wikidata="Q55392" url="?curid=309667" title="Louis Malle">
<text>Louis Marie Malle (; 30 October 1932 – 23 November 1995) was a French film director, screenwriter, and producer who worked in both French cinema and Hollywood. Described as &quot;eclectic&quot; and &quot;a filmmaker difficult to pin down&quot;, Malle made documentaries, romances, period dramas, and thrillers. He often depicted provocative or controversial subject matter.

Malle&#x27;s most famous works include the crime thriller &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot; (1958), the romantic drama &quot;The Lovers&quot; (1958), the World War II drama &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; (1974), the period drama &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978), the romantic crime film &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980), the dramedy &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), and the autobiographical &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot; (1987). He also co-directed the landmark underwater documentary &quot;The Silent World&quot; with Jacques Cousteau, which won the 1956 and the 1957 Academy Award for Best Documentary.

Malle is one of only four directors to have won the Golden Lion twice. His other accolades include three Césars, two BAFTAs, and three Oscar nominations. He was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1991.

==Early life==
Malle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France, the son of Françoise (Béghin) and Pierre Malle.

During World War II, Malle attended a Catholic boarding school near Fontainebleau. As an 11-year-old he witnessed a Gestapo raid on the school, in which three Jewish students, including his close friend, and a Jewish teacher were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz. The school&#x27;s headmaster, Père Jacques, was arrested for harboring them and sent to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. Malle depicted these events in his autobiographical film &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot; (1987).

As a young man, Malle studied political science at Sciences Po from 1950 to 1952 (some sources incorrectly state that he studied at the Sorbonne) before turning to film studies at IDHEC.

== Career ==

Malle worked as co-director and cameraman with Jacques Cousteau on the documentary &quot;The Silent World&quot; (1956), which won an Oscar and the at the 1956 Academy Awards and Cannes Film Festival, respectively. He assisted Robert Bresson on &quot;A Man Escaped&quot; (&quot;Un condamné à mort s&#x27;est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut&quot;, 1956) before making his first feature, &quot;Ascenseur pour l&#x27;échafaud&quot; in 1957 (released in the U.K. as &quot;Lift to the Scaffold&quot; and in the U.S. originally as &quot;Frantic&quot;, later as &quot;Elevator to the Gallows&quot;). A taut thriller featuring an original score by Miles Davis, &quot;Ascenseur pour l&#x27;échafaud&quot; made an international film star of Jeanne Moreau, at the time a leading stage actress of the Comédie-Française. Malle was 24 years old.

Malle&#x27;s &quot;The Lovers&quot; (&quot;Les Amants&quot;, 1958), which also starred Moreau, caused major controversy due to its sexual content, leading to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case about the legal definition of obscenity. In &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot;, a theater owner was fined $2,500 for obscenity. The Supreme Court overturned the decision, finding that the film was not obscene and hence constitutionally protected. But the court could not agree on a definition of &quot;obscene&quot;, with Justice Potter Stewart famously saying, &quot;I know it when I see it&quot;.

Malle is sometimes associated with the &quot;nouvelle vague&quot;, but his work does not directly fit in with or correspond to the auteurist theories that apply to the work of Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Éric Rohmer and others, and he had nothing to do with &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;. But Malle&#x27;s work does exemplify some of the movement&#x27;s characteristics, such as using natural light and shooting on location, and his film &quot;Zazie dans le Métro&quot; (&quot;Zazie in the Metro&quot;, 1960, an adaptation of the Raymond Queneau novel) inspired Truffaut to write Malle an enthusiastic letter.

Other films also tackled taboo subjects: &quot;The Fire Within&quot; centers on a man about to commit suicide, &quot;Le souffle au cœur&quot; (1971) deals with an incestuous relationship between mother and son, and &quot;Lacombe, Lucien&quot; (1974), co-written with Patrick Modiano, is about collaboration with the Nazis in Vichy France during World War II. The second of these earned Malle his first (of three) Oscar nominations for &quot;Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced&quot;.

===Documentary on India===
Malle visited India in 1968, and made the seven-part documentary series &quot;L&#x27;Inde fantôme: Reflexions sur un voyage&quot; and the documentary film &quot;Calcutta&quot;, which was released in cinemas. Concentrating on real India, its rituals and festivities, Malle fell afoul of the Indian government, which disliked his portrayal of the country, in its fascination with the pre-modern, and consequently banned the BBC from filming in India for several years. Malle later said his documentary on India was his favorite film.

===Move to the U.S.===
Malle later moved to the United States and continued to direct there. His later films include &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (1978), &quot;Atlantic City&quot; (1980), &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), &quot;Crackers&quot; (1984), &quot;Alamo Bay&quot; (1985), &quot;Damage&quot; (1992) and &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot; (1994, an adaptation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;) in English; and &quot;Au revoir les enfants&quot; (1987) and &quot;Milou en Mai&quot; (&quot;May Fools&quot; in the U.S., 1990) in French. Just as his earlier films such as &quot;The Lovers&quot; helped popularize French films in the U.S., &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; was at the forefront of the rise of American independent cinema in the 1980s.

Towards the end of his life, cultural correspondent Melinda Camber Porter interviewed Malle extensively for &quot;The Times&quot;. In 1993, the interviews were included in her book &quot;Through Parisian Eyes: Reflections On Contemporary French Arts And Culture&quot;.

==Personal life==
Malle was married to actress Anne-Marie Deschodt from 1965 to 1967. He later had a son, Manuel Cuotemoc Malle (born 1971), with German actress Gila von Weitershausen, and a daughter, filmmaker Justine Malle (born 1974), with Canadian actress Alexandra Stewart. From mid-1977 until early 1980, he was in a relationship with Susan Sarandon.

Malle married actress Candice Bergen in 1980. They had one child, Chloé Françoise Malle, on 8 November 1985. Malle died of lymphoma, aged 63, at their home in Beverly Hills, California, on 23 November 1995.
