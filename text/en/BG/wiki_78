<text>Ashurbanipal (, meaning &quot;Ashur is the creator of the heir&quot;) — or Osnappar in Aramaic — was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 669 BC to his death in 631. He is generally remembered as the last great king of Assyria. Ashurbanipal inherited the throne as the favored heir of his father Esarhaddon; his 38-year reign was among the longest of any Assyrian king. Though sometimes regarded as the apogee of ancient Assyria, his reign also marked the last time Assyrian armies waged war throughout the ancient Near East and the beginning of the end of Assyrian dominion over the region.

Esarhaddon selected Ashurbanipal as heir 673. The selection of Ashurbanipal bypassed the elder son Shamash-shum-ukin. Perhaps in order to avoid future rivalry, Esarhaddon designated Shamash-shum-ukin as the heir to Babylonia. The two brothers jointly acceded to their respective thrones after Esarhaddon&#x27;s death in 669, though Shamash-shum-ukin was relegated to being Ashurbanipal&#x27;s closely monitored vassal. Much of the early years of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign was spent fighting rebellions in Egypt, which had been conquered by his father. The most extensive campaigns of Ashurbanipal were those directed towards Elam, an ancient enemy of Assyria, and against Shamash-shum-ukin, who gradually began to resent the overbearing control that his younger brother held over him. Elam was defeated in a series of conflicts in 665, 653 and 647–646. Shamash-shum-ukin rebelled in 652 and assembled a coalition of Assyria&#x27;s enemies but was defeated and died during Ashurbanipal&#x27;s siege of Babylon in 648. On account of a lack of surviving records, much of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s late reign is poorly known.

Ashurbanipal is chiefly remembered today for his cultural efforts. A patron of artwork and literature, Ashurbanipal was deeply interested in the ancient literary culture of Mesopotamia. Over the course of his long reign, Ashurbanipal utilized the massive resources at his disposal to construct the Library of Ashurbanipal, a collection of texts and documents of various different genres. Perhaps comprising over 100,000 texts at its height, the Library of Ashurbanipal was not surpassed until the construction of the Library of Alexandria, several centuries later. The more than 30,000 cuneiform texts that have survived from the library are a highly important source on ancient Mesopotamian language, religion, literature and science. Artwork produced under Ashurbanipal was innovative in style and motifs and is regarded to possess an &quot;epic quality&quot; otherwise absent from much of the art produced under previous kings.

Ashurbanipal is recognized as one of the most brutal Assyrian kings; he was one of the few rulers to boast of his gory massacres of rebellious civilians. His extensive destruction of Elam is regarded by some scholars as a genocide. The Assyrians won many battles under Ashurbanipal, campaigning further from the Assyrian heartland than ever before, but several of his campaigns achieved little strategic advantage. Ashurbanipal failed to maintain control of Egypt, and his wars in Arabia cost time and resources without establishing longterm Assyrian control. His extensive sack of Babylon after defeating Shamash-shum-ukin weakened the resources of the empire and fanned anti-Assyrian sentiment in southern Mesopotamia, perhaps contributing to the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire five years after Ashurbanipal&#x27;s death. Whether Ashurbanipal&#x27;s policies led to the fall of the Assyrian Empire only two decades after his death is disputed in modern Assyriology. 

A distorted legend of Ashurbanipal was remembered in Greco-Roman literary tradition under the name Sardanapalus, purportedly the effeminate and decadent last king of Assyria whose vices led to the fall of his empire.

== Background and accession ==

=== Becoming the heir to Assyria ===

Born 685 BC, Ashurbanipal succeeded his father Esarhaddon (). Though Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions suggest that he was divinely preordained to rule, his accession was far from straightforward, and its political complexities sowed the seeds for later civil war. Ashurbanipal was probably Esarhaddon&#x27;s fourth eldest son, younger than Esarhaddon&#x27;s first crown prince Sin-nadin-apli and the other two sons Shamash-shum-ukin and Shamash-metu-uballit. He also had an older sister, Serua-eterat, and several younger brothers. 

The Assyrian court was thrown into upheaval upon the unexpected death of Sin-nadin-apli in 674. Esarhaddon&#x27;s own father Sennacherib had bypassed Esarhaddon&#x27;s elder brother Arda-Mulissu for the crown, and the rejected heir had murdered Sennacherib, with Esarhaddon winning the ensuing civil war. After the death of his own heir, Esarhaddon quickly made new succession plans, naming his younger son Ashurbanipal as primary heir and emperor of Assyria, and his eldest surviving son Shamash-shum-ukin as king of Babylon (southern Mesopotamia), with the two to rule as &quot;equal brothers&quot;. He entirely bypassed his third eldest son, Shamash-metu-uballit, older than Ashurbanipal, perhaps because of poor health.

Scholars have speculated at Esarhaddon&#x27;s reasons for the divided succession, which broke with the Assyrian tradition of unitary rule. The arrangement might have been intended to assuage the elder Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s jealousy toward his younger brother Ashurbanipal, avoiding future rivalry. One hypothesis is that Ashurbanipal&#x27;s mother was Assyrian while Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s was Babylonian, which might have disfavored him for the Assyrian throne. However, it is equally likely that the two heirs shared a mother, possibly Esharra-hammat (Esarhaddon&#x27;s primary consort).

The two princes arrived at the Assyrian capital of Nineveh together and partook in a celebration in May 672 with foreign representatives, Assyrian nobles and military commanders. Since the name Ashurbanipal (&quot;Aššur-bāni-apli&quot;) means &quot;Ashur is the creator of the heir&quot;, it was likely bestowed at this time, while his previous name is unknown. It was also perhaps around this time that Ashurbanipal married his future queen, Libbali-sharrat.

=== Crown prince and accession ===

Ashurbanipal entered the &quot;House of Succession&quot;, the palace of the crown prince. He began training for his duties as ruler, learning hunting, riding, scholarship and wisdom, archery, chariotry, and other military arts. Because his father Esarhaddon was constantly ill during his last few years, much of the administration of the empire fell upon Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin. Letters between the two heirs from this time show that Ashurbanipal managed the empire&#x27;s intelligence network, gathering strategic information from abroad and compiling reports for his father.

Ashurbanipal became king of Assyria in late 669 following Esarhaddon&#x27;s death, having been crown prince for only three years. He mounted to what may have been the most powerful throne on Earth, but his sovereignty may not have been secure. His grandmother Naqi&#x27;a wrote the Zakutu Treaty, which bound the royal family, aristocracy, and all Assyria to swear loyalty to Ashubanipal. There however appears to have been no strong opposition to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s rise to power. Shamash-shum-ukin was somewhat belatedly crowned king of Babylon in the spring of the next year. His coronation was marked by Ashurbanipal&#x27;s gift of the sacred Statue of Marduk, stolen from Babylon by Sennacherib twenty years before. Shamash-shum-ukin would rule Babylon for sixteen years, apparently without open conflict with his younger brother, but there would be repeated disagreements on the extent of his independence.

Esarhaddon&#x27;s succession decrees equivocated on the balance of power between the two heirs. Ashurbanipal was the primary heir to the empire, and Shamash-shum-ukin was to swear allegiance to him, but Ashurbanipal was not to interfere in Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s affairs. Ashurbanipal shifted the balance of power in his own favor, perhaps fearing that true independence would give his older brother the means to threaten his rule.

== Military campaigns ==

=== Egyptian campaigns ===
In 671 Ashurbanipal&#x27;s father Esarhaddon conquered Egypt, defeating the Kushite Pharaoh Taharqa, the first time Egypt had been under Assyrian rule. It was Esarhaddon&#x27;s greatest triumph and brought the Assyrian Empire to its greatest extent. Assyrian control of Egypt was weak, however, as Taharqa retreated south to Nubia and schemed to retake his lands. Esarhaddon sent troops to garrison Egyptian cities and appointed local Egyptian nobles as vassal rulers of the country. In 669, Taharqa led Egypt in a revolt against Assyria, and Esarhaddon left Nineveh to meet the threat, but fell ill and died on the way. The campaign lapsed while Ashurbanipal was succeeding to his father&#x27;s throne, and many of the Egyptian vassal rulers joined the revolt to expel the foreign conquerors. After they massacred the Assyrian garrison in Memphis, Ashurbanipal sent an army against the rebels.
On their way to Egypt, the Assyrian army collected tribute and military reinforcements from the various Levantine vassal states, including Manasseh of Judah and various rulers from Cyprus. The expeditionary forces fought their way through Egypt, winning a decisive battle at Kar-Banitu in Lower Egypt. According to Assyrian sources, Taharqa and his supporters fled from Memphis to Thebes, then escaped back to Nubia, and the Assyrian army re-occupied Memphis. Some conspirators who had remained at Memphis, including the local vassal ruler Necho I, were taken back to Assyria, and after swearing new oaths of loyalty were unexpectedly allowed to return and resume their posts in Egypt.

After Taharqa&#x27;s death in 664, his nephew Tantamani proclaimed himself pharaoh and invaded Egypt, swiftly gained control of Thebes, and marched on Memphis. Ashurbanipal once again sent the Assyrian army. By Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account, Tantamani fled south as soon as the Assyrian army entered Egypt. In retaliation for the repeated rebellion, the Assyrians heavily plundered Thebes. The sacking was the most serious calamity ever to befall the ancient city, one of the major political and religious centers in Egypt. The city might have been razed to the ground but for the skillful diplomacy of its governor Mentuemhat. Tantamani was not pursued beyond the Egyptian border. Upon the return of the Assyrian army to Nineveh, spoils from Thebes were paraded through the streets and many treasures and obelisks were refashioned to incorporate into for Ashurbanipal&#x27;s projects.

=== Initial Elamite conflicts ===

In 665, the Elamite king Urtak, who had kept peaceful relations with Esarhaddon, launched a surprise attack against Babylonia. Urtak was successfully driven back into Elam, dying shortly thereafter. He was succeeded as Elamite king by Teumman, who was unrelated to the previous monarch and had to stabilize his rule by killing his political rivals. Three of Urtak&#x27;s sons, chief rival claimants to the Elamite throne, escaped to Assyria and were harbored by Ashurbanipal, despite Teumman demanding them to be returned to Elam.

Following the 665 victory over the Elamites, Ashurbanipal had to deal with a series of revolts within his own borders. Bel-iqisha, chieftain of the Gambulians (an Aramean tribe) in Babylonia, rebelled after he had been implicated as supporting the Elamite invasion and was forced to relinquish some of his authority. Little is known of this revolt, but there is a letter preserved in which Ashurbanipal orders the governor of Uruk, Nabu-usabsi, to attack Bel-iqisha. Nabu-usabsi apparently claimed that Bel-iqisha was solely to blame for the Elamite invasion. Bel-iqisha&#x27;s revolt does not appear to have caused much damage and he was killed shortly after revolting by a boar. Shortly thereafter in 663, Bel-iqisha&#x27;s son Dunanu also surrendered to Ashurbanipal.

After a long period of peace, Teumman attacked Babylonia in 653. Because Ashurbanipal had not entrusted Shamash-shum-ukin with any substantial military forces, he was unable to defend Babylonia against the Elamite invasion and the latter had to rely on Ashurbanipal for military support. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s army first advanced south and secured the city of Der. Though Teumman marched to meet the Assyrians, he soon changed his mind and fell back to the Elamite capital of Susa. The final battle in the war with Teumman, the Battle of Ulai, took place near Susa and was a decisive Assyrian victory, partly due to defections in the Elamite army. Teumann was killed in the battle, as was one of his vassals, Shutruk-Nahhunte of Hidalu. In the aftermath of his victory, Ashurbanipal installed two of Urtak&#x27;s sons as rulers, proclaiming Ummanigash as king at Madaktu and Susa and Tammaritu I as king at Hidalu. This intervention into the Elamite succession weakened both Elamite opposition towards Assyria and Elamite royal authority. In his inscriptions, Ashurbanipal described his victory at Ulai with the following account:

Dunanu, who had joined the Elamites in the war, was captured alongside his family and executed. The Gambulians were attacked by Ashurbanipal&#x27;s army and brutally punished, with their capital of Shapibel being flooded and many of its inhabitants slaughtered. In Dananu&#x27;s stead, Ashurbanipal appointed a noble called Rimutu as the new Gambulian chieftain after he had agreed to pay a considerable sum in tribute to the Assyrian king.

=== Diplomacy and incursions into Assyria ===

The Cimmerians, a nomadic Indo-European people living in the southern Caucasus north of Assyria, had invaded Assyria during the reign of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s father. After Esarhaddon defeated them, the Cimmerians turned to attack Lydia in western Anatolia, ruled by Gyges. After allegedly receiving advice from the Assyrian national deity Ashur in a dream, Gyges sent his diplomats to ask Ashurbanipal for assistance. The Assyrians did not even know that Lydia existed; after the two states successfully established communication with the help of interpreters, the Cimmerian invasion of Lydia was defeated 665. Two Cimmerian chiefs were imprisoned in Nineveh and large amounts of spoils were secured by Ashurbanipal&#x27;s forces. The extent to which the Assyrian army was involved in the Lydian campaign is unknown, but it appears that Gyges was disappointed with the help since he just twelve years later broke his alliance with Ashurbanipal and allied with the increasingly independent Egypt instead. After this, Ashurbanipal cursed Gyges. When Lydia was overrun by its enemies 652–650 there was much rejoicing in Assyria.

While the Assyrian forces were on campaign in Elam, an alliance of Persians, Cimmerians and Medes marched on Nineveh and managed to reach the city&#x27;s walls. To counteract this threat, Ashurbanipal called on his Scythian allies and successfully defeated the enemy army. The Median king, Phraortes, is generally held to have been killed in the fighting. This attack is poorly documented and it is possible that Phraortes was not present at all and his unfortunate death instead belongs to a Median campaign during the reign of one of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s successors.

After his death 652, Gyges was succeeded by his son Ardys. Because the Scythians had driven the Cimmerians from their homes, the Cimmerians invaded Lydia again and successfully captured of the kingdom. As his father had before him, Ardys also sent for aid from Ashurbanipal, stating that &quot;You cursed my father and bad luck befell him; but bless me, your humble servant, and I will carry your yoke&quot;. It is unknown if any Assyrian aid arrived, but Lydia was successfully freed from the Cimmerians. They would not be driven out of Lydia completely until the reign of Ardys&#x27;s grandson Alyattes.

=== Civil war with Shamash-shum-ukin ===

==== Rising tensions and rebellion ====

Although Esarhaddon&#x27;s inscriptions suggest that Shamash-shum-ukin should have been granted the entirety of Babylonia to rule, contemporary records only definitely prove that Shamash-shum-ukin held Babylon itself and its vicinity. The governors of some Babylonian cities, such as Nippur, Uruk and Ur, and the rulers in the Sea Land, all ignored the existence of a king in Babylon and saw Ashurbanipal as their monarch. Despite this, Shamash-shum-ukin had initially been positively inclined towards his brother, viewing him as his equal. In letters, Shamash-shum-ukin addressed Ashurbanipal simply as &quot;my brother&quot; (unlike how he addressed his father Esarhaddon, &quot;the king, my father&quot;). Although there are several letters preserved from Shamash-shum-ukin to Ashurbanipal, there are no known replies. It is possible that Ashurbanipal, on account of his network of informers, did not feel a need to write to his brother. By the 650s, Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s opinion of Ashurbanipal had significantly deteriorated, owing to the increasing intervention and involvement of Ashurbanipal in Babylonian affairs, Ashurbanipal often delaying when help was needed, and growing dissatisfaction with his position relative to that of Ashurbanipal. A letter written during this time by Zakir, a courtier at Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s court, to Ashurbanipal described how visitors from the Sea Land had publicly criticized Ashurbanipal in front of Shamash-shum-ukin, using the phrase &quot;this is not the word of a king!&quot;. Zakir reported that though Shamash-shum-ukin was angered, he and his governor of Babylon, Ubaru, chose to not take action against the visitors.
Aspiring to become independent of Ashurbanipal and free Babylonia under his own rule, Shamash-shum-ukin revolted in 652. According to later Aramaic-language legends, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s and Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s sister Serua-eterat attempted to intervene and stop the two from fighting; after the war broke out the legends hold that she disappeared into self-imposed exile. The war between the brothers lasted for three years. In addition to resenting Ashurbanipal&#x27;s overbearing control, Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s revolt was also facilitated by the certainty of support in the south: the Babylonians constantly resented Assyrian control and the rulers of Elam were certain allies, always willing to join anyone who waged war against Assyria. Inscription evidence suggests that Shamash-shum-ukin addressed the citizens of Babylon to join him in his revolt. In Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions, Shamash-shum-ukin is quoted to have said &quot;Ashurbanipal will cover with shame the name of the Babylonians&quot;, which Ashurbanipal refers to as &quot;wind&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;. Soon after Shamash-shum-ukin began his revolt, the rest of southern Mesopotamia rose up against Ashurbanipal alongside him. The beginning of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account of the conflict reads as follows:

According to the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, Shamash-shum-ukin was very successful in finding allies. Ashurbanipal identified three groups who aided his brother: first and foremost there were the Chaldeans, Arameans and the other peoples of Babylonia, then there were the Elamites, and lastly the kings of Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha. This last group of kings might refer to the Medes (as Gutium, Amurru and Meluhha no longer existed at this point) but this is uncertain. Meluhha might have referred to Egypt, though the Egyptians are not documented to have aided Shamash-shum-ukin in the war. Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s ambassadors to the Elamites had offered gifts (called &quot;bribes&quot; by Ashurbanipal) and their king, Ummanigash, sent an army under the command of Undashe, the son of Teumman, to aid in the conflict. For the first two years of the conflict, battles were fought all across Babylonia, some won by the Assyrians and some won by Shamash-shum-ukin and his allies. The war quickly turned chaotic; several minor players repeatedly changed sides and both Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin found it difficult to keep track of their allies. Among the most notorious double agents were Nabu-bel-shumati, a governor of the far south in Babylonia whose repeated betrayals enraged Ashurbanipal.

==== Fall of Shamash-shum-ukin ====

Despite this seemingly strong alliance of Assyrian enemies, Shamash-shum-ukin failed to halt Ashurbanipal&#x27;s advance. As the war progressed, his forces were slowly defeated, his allies diminished and his lands were lost. By 650 the situation looked grim, with Ashurbanipal&#x27;s forces having besieged Sippar, Borsippa, Kutha and Babylon itself. During Ashurbanipal&#x27;s siege of Babylon, the city entered into a period of famine. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account of the siege claimed that some of the citizens grew so hungry and desperate that they ate their own children. Having endured both starvation and disease, Babylon fell in 648, after a siege lasting two years. The city was extensively plundered by Ashurbanipal. According to his own inscriptions, Ashurbanipal initiated a bloodbath: &quot;their carved up bodies I fed to dogs, to pigs, to wolves, to eagles, to birds of the heavens, to fishes of the deep&quot;. At the time of the city&#x27;s fall, a great fire also spread within Babylon. Shamash-shum-ukin is traditionally believed to have committed suicide by stepping into the flames, or by setting himself and his family on fire in his palace. Contemporary texts however only say that he &quot;met a cruel death&quot; and that the gods &quot;consigned him to a fire and destroyed his life&quot;. In addition to suicide through self-immolation or other means, it is possible that he was executed, died accidentally or was killed in some other way. If Shamash-shum-ukin was executed, it would be logical for the Assyrian scribes to leave this out of historical records since fratricide (killing a brother) was illegal and even if a soldier (and not Ashurbanipal) had carried it out, it would still constitute a murder of a member of the Assyrian royal family.
After Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s defeat, Ashurbanipal appointed a new vassal king of Babylon, Kandalanu, of whom little is known. Kandalanu&#x27;s realm was the same as Shamash-shum-ukin&#x27;s with the exception of the city of Nippur, which Ashurbanipal converted into a powerful Assyrian fortress. The authority of Kandalanu is likely to have been very limited and few records survive of his reign at Babylon. He might have been another one of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s brothers or perhaps a Babylonian noble who had allied with Ashurbanipal in the civil war and had consequently been rewarded with the rank of king. Kandalanu probably lacked any true political and military power, which was instead firmly in the hands of Ashurbanipal.

Due to the defeat and death of a member of the Assyrian royal family, the defeat of Shamash-shum-ukin was Ashurbanipal&#x27;s most problematic victory. The civil war also had significant broader consequences impacting Assyrian dominion. Though Babylonia slowly recovered after the war, the war exhausted economic resources and decreased the power and authority of the Assyrian Empire. Signs of decline had already been visible before the civil war but its conclusion is regarded by modern historians to mark the end of the height of Assyrian authority. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s sack of Babylon, the second extensive sack of the city in thirty years, also fanned anti-Assyrian sentiment in southern Babylonia and might thus have been a decisive factor in the Babylonian revolt by Nabopolassar a few years after Ashurbanipal&#x27;s death, which led to the formation of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and the fall of Assyria.

=== Destruction of Elam ===
The Elamite effort to support Shamash-shum-ukin in the civil war had largely come to an end with the early defeat of Ummanigash&#x27;s army near the city of Der. As a result of Ummanigash&#x27;s defeat, he was deposed in Elam by Tammaritu II, who then took the throne for himself. Ummanigash fled to the Assyrian court where he was granted asylum by Ashurbanipal. Tammaritu II&#x27;s rule was brief and despite success in some battles against the Assyrians, alongside the rogue governor Nabu-bel-shumati (already notorious for his role in the war with Shamash-shum-ukin), he was deposed in another revolt in 649. The new king, Indabibi, had an extremely brief reign and was murdered after Ashurbanipal threatened to invade Elam again because of the kingdom&#x27;s role in supporting Shamash-shum-ukin and his other enemies.

In Indabibi&#x27;s stead, Humban-haltash III became king in Elam. Nabu-bel-shumati continued fighting against Ashurbanipal from outposts within Elam and though Humban-haltash was in favor of giving up the Chaldean rebel, Nabu-bel-shumati had too many supporters in Elam in order for this to go through. Because Humban-haltash could thus not respond to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s threats, the Assyrians invaded Elam again in 647. After the Elamite defense collapsed, Humban-haltash abandoned his seat at Madaktu and fled into the mountains. He was briefly replaced as king by Tammaritu II, who regained his throne. After the Assyrians had plundered the region of Khuzestan they returned home, prompting Humban-haltash to reemerge from the mountains and retake the throne.

The Assyrians returned to Elam in 646 and Humban-haltash again abandoned Madaktu, fleeing first to the city Dur-Untash and then into the mountains in eastern Elam. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s forces pursued him, plundering and razing cities on their way. All major political centers in Elam were crushed and nearby chiefdoms and petty kingdoms who had previously paid tribute to the Elamite king began paying tribute to Ashurbanipal instead. Among these kingdoms was Parsua, possibly a predecessor of the empire that would be founded by the Achaemenids a century later. Parsua&#x27;s king, Cyrus (possibly the same person as Cyrus I, the grandfather of Cyrus the Great), had originally sided with the Elamites at the beginning of the campaign, and had thus been forced to supply his son Arukku as a hostage. Countries which had never previously had contact with the Assyrians, such as a kingdom ruled by a king called Ḫudimiri which &quot;extended beyond Elam&quot;, also began paying tribute to the Assyrians for the first time.

On their way back from their campaign, the Assyrian forces brutally plundered Susa. In Ashurbanipal&#x27;s triumphant inscriptions detailing the sack it is described in great detail, recounting how the Assyrians desecrated the royal tombs, looted and razed temples, stole the statues of the Elamite gods and sowed salt in the ground. The ancient Elamite capital was wiped off the face of the earth and Ashurbanipal then continued with the destruction of Elamite settlements on a massive scale. In addition to the destruction of numerous cities, thousands of those Elamites who were not killed were deported away from their homeland. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s brutal suppression of Elam is sometimes considered a genocide. The detail and length of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions concerning the destructions suggest that the events were meant to shock the world, signalling the defeat and eradication of the Elamites as a distinct cultural entity.

Despite the thorough and brutal campaign, the Elamites endured as a political entity for some time. Ashurbanipal did not annex Elam, instead leaving it to its own devices. Humban-haltash returned to rule at Madaktu and (belatedly) sent Nabu-bel-shumati to Ashurbanipal, though the Chaldean committed suicide on his way to Nineveh. After Humban-haltash was deposed, captured and sent to the Assyrians in a revolt shortly thereafter, Assyrian records cease to speak of Elam. Elam was ultimately unable to ever fully recover from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s efforts in 646 and was left open to attack from tribes and kings in the surrounding lands, eventually disappearing altogether from the historical record.

=== Arabian campaigns ===

Assyrian interests in the Levant and other western territories were at times challenged on account of Arab tribal groups raiding Assyrian territories or disrupting trade. On occasion, the Assyrian army intervened, deposing and replacing problematic tribal rulers. Ashurbanipal oversaw two campaigns against Arab tribes, though their chronology is somewhat uncertain and his narrative of these conflicts was altered over the course of his later reign. The Arabian campaigns have received relatively little attention from modern historians but they are the conflicts with the most lengthy and detailed accounts in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s own writings.

Ashurbanipal&#x27;s first campaign against the Arabs was conducted some time before the war with Shamash-shum-ukin, primarily against the Qedarites. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s earliest account of his campaign against the Qedarites was created in 649 and describes how Yauta, son of Ḫazaʾil, king of the Qedarites, revolted against Ashurbanipal together with another Arab king, Ammuladdin, and plundered the western lands of the Assyrian Empire. According to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account, the Assyrian army, together with the army of Kamas-halta of Moab, defeated the rebel forces. Ammuladdin was captured and sent in chains to Assyria but Yauta escaped. In the place of Yauta a loyal Arabian warlord called Abiyate was granted kingship of the Qedarites. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account of this conflict is markedly different from the accounts of his other campaigns: the phrase &quot;in my &quot;n&quot;th campaign&quot; (otherwise always used) is missing, the defeat of the enemy is explicitly attributed to the army rather than to Ashurbanipal personally, and Yauta escapes rather than being captured and/or executed. A second version of the narrative, composed a year later, also includes that Ashurbanipal defeated Adiya, a queen of the Arabs, and that Yauta fled to another chieftain, Natnu of the Nabayyate, who refused him and remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Even later versions of the narrative also include mentions of how Yauta previously revolted against Esarhaddon, years prior. These later accounts also explicitly connect Yauta&#x27;s rebellion to the revolt of Shamash-shum-ukin, placing it at the same time and suggesting that the western raids by the Arabs were prompted by the instability caused by the Assyrian civil war. In both accounts, the Qedarite lands were thoroughly plundered at the conclusion of the war.

Some of the Arab tribal leaders joined Shamash-shum-ukin in the Assyrian civil war. Among them were Abiyate, made king by Ashurbanipal&#x27;s forces, and his brother Aya-ammu, who sent soldiers to Babylonia. Because of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s focus on Elam, they initially escaped retaliation and punishment. As the Elamite wars dragged on, several Arab rulers ceased to pay tribute to Ashurbanipal and began raiding nearby Assyrian settlements, severely disrupting trade. This development proved enough for Ashurbanipal&#x27;s generals to organize a major campaign to restore order. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s account of this conflict largely concerns the movements of his army through Syria in search of Uiate (conflated with Yauta but possibly a different person) and his Arabian soldiers. According to the account, the Assyrian army marched from Syria to Damascus and then on to Hulhuliti, after which they captured Abiyate and defeated Uššo and Akko. The Assyrians were reportedly faced with great difficulties during this war on account of the unfamiliar and hostile terrain. The Nabayyate, who had aided Ashurbanipal in the previous campaign, are mentioned as being defeated in the second war against the Arabs, without any further information on what had led to the change in their relationship between the two campaigns. The last known version of the Arabian narrative specifies the two campaigns as together composing Ashurbanipal&#x27;s ninth campaign and further expands them with more details. In this version, Abiyate and Ammuladdin are specified to have joined Shamash-shum-ukin. Ashurbanipal is in this version also for the first time personally credited with the victories of the campaign. This later version also states that Uiate was captured and paraded in Nineveh together with prisoners captured during the wars in Elam, that Uiate was hitched up to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s chariot like a horse, and that Aya-ammu was flayed alive.

Supposedly spoils brought back from the Arabian campaigns were so extensive that they caused inflation in the Assyrian Empire and famine in Arabia. Despite this, and despite being impressive in the sense that no previous Assyrian ruler had campaigned against the Arabs with the same vigor, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s Arabian campaigns are sometimes assessed as a strategic blunder. The two wars were time-consuming, wasted valuable resources and failed to consolidate Assyrian rule over any of the lands they took place in.

== Late reign and succession ==

The end of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign and the beginning of the reign of his son and successor, Ashur-etil-ilani, is shrouded in mystery on account of a lack of available sources. Events in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign after 649 are relatively poorly recorded since the secure eponym canon (known Assyrian year names) ends in that year. After 639, only two inscriptions by Ashurbanipal are known, a sharp contrast to the abundant records known from previous years. This scarcity of documentation might reflect the beginning of a serious internal political crisis. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s late reign appears to have seen a growing disconnect between the king and the traditional elite of the empire. Ashurbanipal heavily promoted eunuchs to prominent positions, to the detriment of the nobility and aristocracy. At some point late in his reign, the chief singer, Bullutu, was made eponym, an unprecedented and perhaps self-indulgent move. Some Assyriologists, such as Eckart Frahm, have drawn parallels between the sparse evidence from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s late reign and Sardanapalus, in Greco-Roman literary tradition the decadent last king of Assyria, based on Ashurbanipal. Ashurbanipal himself recognized that he had failed to maintain the durability of the Assyrian Empire. In one of his final known inscriptions, saddened and faced with his own mortality due to illness, lamented the state of his empire. This inscription reads:

In addition to internal strife, it is clear that the hold of the Assyrian Empire on its peripheral regions had severely weakened by the end of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign. Some peripheral lands had regained independence; there was for instance no longer an Assyrian presence in the southern Levant, where the Egyptians had instead become the hegemonic power. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s late reign may have also seen the beginning of rebellious movements in Babylonia (precursors of that of Nabopolassar). Egypt already regained independence in the middle of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign. Egypt appears to have been liberated peacefully and gradually under Necho I&#x27;s son and successor Psamtik I, who had been educated at the Assyrian court. After becoming king in 664 as a loyal Assyrian vassal, Psamtik slowly extended his control across all of Egypt, unifying the country in 656 and initiating a period of renaissance and prosperity, eventually becoming fully independent of Ashurbanipal. Psamtik remained an ally of Assyria; during the later Medo-Babylonian conquest of the Assyrian Empire in the reign of Sinsharishkun (Ashur-etil-ilani&#x27;s successor and another son of Ashurbanipal) both Psamtik and his son Necho II rushed to Assyria&#x27;s aid, with Egyptian armies fighting alongside the Assyrians.

Inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani suggest that his father died a natural death, but do not shed light on when or how this happened. Though his final year is often erroneously given as 627 or even 626, this follows an estimate from an inscription written nearly a century later at Harran by Adad-guppi, the mother of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus (). The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from Nippur made in 631. If Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign had ended in 627 the inscriptions of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun in Babylon (covering several years) would have been impossible, given that the city was seized by Nabopolassar in 626 and never again fell into Assyrian hands. To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, it is generally agreed that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 or 630. 631 is typically favored as the year of his death. Ashurbanipal was succeeded as king by Ashur-etil-ilani and he seems to have been inspired by the succession plans of his father, despite its consequences, given that Sinsharishkun was granted the fortress-city of Nippur and was designated to be the successor of Kandalanu in Babylon once Kandalanu died.

A handful of historians have attempted to justify a reign of Ashurbanipal extending to 627, though no such proposal is without problems. It is possible that the 42-year (rather than 38-year) error came about in later Mesopotamian historiography on account of the knowledge that Ashurbanipal ruled concurrently with Babylonian rulers Shamash-shum-ukin and Kandalanu, whose reigns together amount to 42 years, but Kandalanu survived Ashurbanipal by three years, actually dying in 627. One possible way to justify a 42-year reign of Ashurbanipal is by assuming there was a coregency between him and Ashur-etil-ilani, but there had never been a coregency in prior Assyrian history and the idea is explicitly contradicted by Ashur-etil-ilani&#x27;s own inscriptions, which describe him as becoming king after the end of his father&#x27;s reign. Another once popular idea, for instance favored by Stefan Zawadzki, is that Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu were the same person, &quot;Kandalanu&quot; simply being the name the king used in Babylon. This idea is generally considered unlikely for several reasons, most notably that no previous Assyrian king is known to have used an alternate name in Babylon and that inscriptions from Babylonia show a difference in the lengths of the reigns of Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu (Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign is counted from his first full year as king, 668, and Kandalanu&#x27;s is counted from his first full year as king, 647). All Assyrian kings who personally ruled Babylon used the title &quot;king of Babylon&quot; in their inscriptions, but that title is not used in any of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions, even those made after 648. Most importantly, Babylonian documents clearly treat Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu as two different people.

== Family and children ==

Ashurbanipal was already married to his queen Libbāli-šarrat (Akkadian: ) at the time of his accession to the throne, perhaps marrying her around the time of his proclamation as crown prince. The marriage occurring around that time is supported by Libbali-sharrat&#x27;s name, which she is attested under before the death of Esarhaddon. The name is unique, not known to have been borne by any other individual, and incorporates the element &quot;šarratum&quot; (&quot;queen&quot;), indicating that it was not her birth name but rather a name perhaps assumed upon her marriage to Ashurbanipal. Libbali-sharrat is most famous for her appearance in the so-called &quot;Garden Party&quot; relief from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace, which depicts her and Ashurbanipal dining together. The scene is noteworthy for being organized around Libbali-sharrat rather than Ashurbanipal and for being the only known image from ancient Assyria depicting an individual other than the king effectively holding court (and even hosting the king).

Three of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s children are known by name, all sons:
*Ashur-etil-ilani ( ), who ruled as king 631–627,
*Sinsharishkun ( ), who ruled as king 627–612,
*Ninurta-sharru-usur (), who played no political role

Libbali-sharrat was presumably the mother of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s immediate successors, Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun. Ninurtas-sharru-usur&#x27;s less prominent role probably derived from him being the son of a lower wife. Libbali-sharrat might have lived for some time after Ashurbanipal&#x27;s death in 631 since there is a tablet dating to Ashur-etil-ilani&#x27;s reign referencing the &quot;mother of the king&quot;. The inscriptions of Sinsharishkun which mention him being selected for the kingship &quot;from among his equals&quot; (i.e., brothers) suggest that Ashurbanipal had more sons in addition to the three known by name. It is also known that Ashurbanipal had at least one daughter given that there are documents from his reign that reference a &quot;daughter of the king&quot;.

Ashurbanipal&#x27;s lineage may have survived the fall of Assyria in 612–609. The mother of the last Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus, Adad-guppi, was from Harran and had Assyrian ancestry. According to her own inscriptions, Adad-guppi was born in the 20th year of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign (648, as years were counted from the king&#x27;s first full year). British scholar Stephanie Dalley considers it &quot;almost certain&quot; that Adad-guppi was a daughter of Ashurbanipal on account of her own inscriptions claiming that Nabonidus was of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s dynastic line. American Professor of Biblical Studies Michael B. Dick has refuted this, pointing out that even though Nabonidus did go to some length to revive some old Assyrian symbols (such as wearing a wrapped cloak in his depictions, absent in those of other Neo-Babylonian kings but present in Assyrian art) and attempted to link himself to the Sargonid dynasty, there is &quot;no evidence whatsoever that Nabonidus was related to the Sargonid Dynasty&quot;.

== Character ==

=== Brutality ===

In Assyrian royal ideology, the Assyrian king was the divinely appointed mortal representative of Ashur. The king was seen as having the moral, humane and necessary obligation to extend Assyria since lands outside Assyria were regarded to be uncivilized and a threat to the cosmic and divine order within the Assyrian Empire. Expansionism was cast as a moral duty to convert chaos to civilization, rather than exploitative imperialism. Because of the Assyrian king&#x27;s role as Ashur&#x27;s representative, resistance or rebellion against Assyrian rule was seen as fighting against divine will, which deserved punishment. Assyrian royal ideology perceived rebels as criminals against the divine world order. Though the royal ideology could thus be used to justify enacting brutal punishments against Assyria&#x27;s enemies, levels of brutality and aggression varied considerably between kings and modern scholars do not view ancient Assyria as a whole as an unusually brutal civilization. Sargon II, the founder of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s dynasty, is for instance known for several times forgiving and sparing defeated enemies. Most kings only enacted brutal acts against enemy soldiers or elites, not against civilians.

Under Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian army campaigned further away from the Assyrian heartland than ever before. Though Ashurbanipal, contrary to the image presented in some of his reliefs and sharply contrasting with his predecessors, probably only rarely (if at all) participated in the military campaigns during his reign, he clearly stands out among the Assyrian kings for his exceptional brutality. It is possible that Ashurbanipal&#x27;s excessive brutality can be partially explained through religious zealotry; he is known to have rebuilt, repaired and expanded a majority of the major shrines throughout his empire and many of the actions he took during his reign were due to omen reports, something he was very interested in. He also appointed two of his younger brothers, Ashur-mukin-paleya and Ashur-etel-shame-erseti-muballissu, as priests in the cities Assur and Harran respectively.&quot;&quot;

When taking all Neo-Assyrian reliefs depicting scenes of brutality together, the highest concentration of them are from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign. Reliefs with brutality scenes from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s time account for 35% of all known such depictions from the Neo-Assyrian period. Ashurbanipal is also the most brutal king in terms of the variety of different scenes depicted. He is one of only four Neo-Assyrian kings (alongside Esarhaddon, Tiglath-Pileser III and Ashurnasirpal II) who in their inscriptions claimed to have killed civilians and the one with the most varied acts against them (including live flaying, dismemberment and impalement). There are also several instances where he is recorded to have brought captive enemies to Nineveh to enthusiastically torture and humiliate them. Women were rarely depicted being harmed in Assyrian artwork, but Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reliefs include some prominent exceptions to this rule. One of the reliefs from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace in Nineveh, given the modern designation BM 124927, includes both dead female bodies and direct attacks against women. The middle part of the relief includes the most brutal act against a woman ever recorded in an Assyrian relief: Assyrian soldiers ripping open a pregnant Arab woman.

=== Cultural pursuits ===

==== Library of Ashurbanipal ====
Ashurbanipal portrayed himself as powerful in both body and mind. Typically portraying himself as carrying both weapons and a stylus, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s inscriptions make him out to be unlike the kings before him, exceptionally well-versed in literature, writing, mathematics and scholarship. Deeply interested in the ancient literary culture of Mesopotamia, Ashurbanipal read complex texts in both Akkadian and Sumerian already in his youth. After he became king, using the massive resources now at his disposal, created the world&#x27;s first &quot;universal&quot; library in Nineveh. The resulting Library of Ashurbanipal is regarded to have been by far the most extensive library in ancient Assyria and the first systematically organized library in the world. In total it encompassed perhaps more than 100,000 texts and it was not surpassed in size until the creation of the Library of Alexandria, centuries later. Around 30,000 of the documents in the library survived the destruction of Nineveh in 612 and have been excavated among the city&#x27;s ruins.The library was assembled at Ashurbanipal&#x27;s command, with scribes being sent out throughout the empire to collect and copy texts of every type and genre from the libraries of the temples. Most of the collected texts were observations of events and omens, texts detailing the behavior of certain men and of animals, texts on the movements of celestial objects and so forth. Present in the library were also dictionaries for Sumerian, Akkadian and other languages and many religious texts, such as rituals, fables, prayers and incantations. In addition, the tablets were organized by shape, such as four-sided tablets recorded financial transactions while round tablets recorded agricultural information. The tablets were separated by subject, identified by colored marks and written descriptions and placed in different rooms. The library contained many tablets from Babylonia, both donated and taken as war booty. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s library probably represented a comprehensive and accurate picture of Mesopotamian learning up until his time. Ashurbanipal himself considered the library to be the signature accomplishment of his reign. In his inscriptions, he boasted of his own intelligence and the library&#x27;s construction:


The library was long remembered in Mesopotamia. As late as in the first century AD, scribes in Babylonia still referred to the long-lost library in some of their texts and letters. Most of the traditional Mesopotamian stories and tales known today, such as the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, the &quot;Enûma Eliš&quot; (the Babylonian creation myth), &quot;Erra&quot;, the &quot;Myth of Etana&quot; and the &quot;Epic of Anzu&quot;, only survived until the modern era because they were included in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s library. The library covered the entire spectrum of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s literary interests and also included folk tales (such as &quot;The Poor Man of Nippur&quot;, a predecessor of one of the tales in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;), handbooks and scientific texts.

The library was excavated in Nineveh by Austen Henry Layard, his assistant Hormuzd Rassam, and W. K. Loftus in 1853. The library tablets have been on display in the British Museum since their discovery and continue to this day, as of 2024. 

==== Artwork ====
Regarded as a patron of the arts, Ashurbanipal erected numerous sculptures and reliefs in his palaces in Nineveh, depicting the most important events from his long reign. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s artwork was innovative in terms of Assyrian art history, often having an &quot;epic quality&quot; unlike much of the more static artwork produced under his predecessors. A motif appearing in several of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s art pieces, for instance the &quot;Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal&quot;, is the king killing lions, a propaganda image illustrating his glory and power, as well as his ability to safeguard the Assyrian people through slaying dangerous animals.

Various new elements can be seen in artwork produced under Ashurbanipal. The regalia of the king changes from relief to relief depending on the scene depicted; informal events for instance typically depict Ashurbanipal with an open crown design different from the typical vaguely bucket-shaped Assyrian crown. There are no known examples of art depicting Ashurbanipal seated on a throne or holding court, a common motif under previous kings, perhaps meaning that the symbol of the throne was losing its status in art, and possible also at court, during his reign. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s artwork is the only ancient Assyrian art that depicts non-Assyrian foreigners as physically different (not only in their equipment and outfits but also in their features) from Assyrians. Possibly influenced by Egyptian art, which did depict foreigners differently, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reliefs show Elamites and Urartians as stockier, Urartians with larger noses, and Arabs with long straight hair (in contrast to the curly hair of the Assyrians). Inscriptions and annals from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s time however offer no evidence that foreigners were seen as racially or ethnically different in terms of biology or physiognomy, which means that this might only have been an artistic choice.

== Legacy ==

=== Sardanapalus legend ===
Tales of Ashurbanipal survived in the cultural memory of the Near East for centuries after the decline of Assyrian power in the region. He is almost certainly identifiable with the figure &quot;Asnappar&quot;, mentioned in the Biblical Book of Ezra (4:10). It is also either Esarhaddon or Ashurbanipal who is the &quot;king of Assyria&quot; mentioned in the Book of 2 Chronicles (33:11). Ashurbanipal has also been most commonly identified as the Assyrian king, &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot;, in the Book of Judith. Ashurbanipal and other ancient Assyrian kings and figures continued to appear in the folklore and literary tradition of northern Mesopotamia. The most prominent later legend concerning Ashurbanipal was the long-lived Greco-Roman Sardanapalus legend. According to the Assyriologist Maria de Fátima Rosa, the Sardanapalus of legend was conceived as &quot;more effeminate than a woman, a lascivious and idle man, a governor who loathed all expressions of militarism and war&quot;. This view stemmed from ancient Greek views on Mesopotamia in general; ancient Mesopotamian kings were typically seen by the Greeks as effeminate and dull despots incapable of securing the welfare for the people of their empires. The earliest known reference to Sardanapalus comes from the 5th-century BCE &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus, which includes a reference to the riches of Sardanapalus, king of Nineveh. Legendary tales in Aramaic, based on the civil war between Ashurbanipal (&quot;Sarbanabal&quot;) and Shamash-shum-ukin (&quot;Sarmuge&quot;), are attested from the 3rd century BC.

The most elaborate and lengthy ancient text concerning Sardanapalus comes from the 1st-century BCE &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; of Diodorus Siculus. Siculus&#x27;s portrayal of Sardanapalus was endowed with ancient Greek orientalism; the king was stated to have lived among women, dressed like them, used a soft voice and engaged in other activities viewed as unnatural for Greek men. In Siculus&#x27;s account, Sardanapalus&#x27;s satrap of Media, Arbaces, saw him mingling with women in the palace and quickly revolted, assaulting Nineveh together with the Babylonian priest Belesys. After failing to urge his soldiers to defend the city, Sardanapalus locked himself in his palace chamber, with treasures and concubines, and lit up a pyre, burning down the entire capital city and ending the Assyrian Empire. It is clear from the narrative that Siculus&#x27;s Sardanapalus is based not only on Ashurbanipal, but also on Shamash-shum-ukin and Sinsharishkun.

The Greek account of ancient Assyria transformed historical perception of the ancient empire and set the image of it in Western Europe for centuries. Since concrete evidence of Assyria and Babylonia was lacking, authors and artists during the Renaissance and Enlightenment based their interpretations of ancient Mesopotamia on classical Greco-Roman writings. In late 17th-century Italy, the composer Domenico Freschi wrote and performed the opera &quot;Sardanapalo&quot;, a comedic tragedy wherein Sardanapalus was portrayed as a woman-like and sex-eager king. In the opera, Sardanapalus, after watching Nineveh crumble, decides to light fire to his palace so that the Assyrian Empire did not fall without a show. In 1821, Lord Byron launched the historical tragedy play &quot;Sardanapalus&quot;, which pairs Sardanapalus with the legendary character Myrrah, often Sardanapalus&#x27;s counterpart in later tales as well. In Byron&#x27;s story, Myrrah was a female Greek slave and loyal supporter of Sardanapalus, who lit the palace on fire after Sardanapalus gave his last words, &quot;Adieu, Assyria! I loved thee well!&quot;. Many operas, inspired by Byron, included similar storylines. It was typical to portray the fall of Nineveh and Assyria as a consequence of Assyria&#x27;s supposed lack of moral values, combined with its ostentation and pomp.

Even after archaeologists and historians began to uncover the true history of ancient Assyria in the 19th century, the perception rooted in Greco-Roman tradition proved to be enduring. When the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard found evidence of a major fire in the ruins of Nimrud (which he believed to be Nineveh) in 1845, his colleagues suggested that this was proof of the Sardanapalus legend. Even after discoveries made it clear that the Sardanapalus of legend was far from a perfect match of the Ashurbanipal of history, the legend was not forgotten. Instead, plays and films featuring Sardanapalus simply began to mix the legendary tale with historical details. Many plays began to incorporate Assyrian architectural details, such as &quot;lamassus&quot;. Two films based on the Sardanapalus legend have been produced in Italy; Giuseppe de Liguoro&#x27;s &quot;Sardanapalo re dell&#x27;Assiria&quot; (1910) and Silvio Amadio&#x27;s &quot;Le sette folgori di Assur&quot; (1962), both heavily influenced by Byron&#x27;s play. Both follow Sardanapalus&#x27;s relationship with Myrrah. In Amadio&#x27;s film, the narrative is also inspired by Ashurbanipal&#x27;s conflict with Shamash-shum-ukin, who appears in the film under the shortened name Shamash.

=== Modern perception ===

==== Rediscoveries and assessments ====

The North Palace of Nineveh, constructed by Ashurbanipal, was rediscovered by the British-funded Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in December 1853. Rassam&#x27;s excavations were a somewhat strange episode in Assyriology, as his efforts were also marked by an intense rivalry with the French archaeologist Victor Place; despite agreements as to who should excavate where, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace was found by Rassam during the night, when he sent out a team of excavators under the cover of darkness to dig in the French portion of the Nineveh excavation. Excavations were conducted in the palace in 1853–1854. Among other discoveries, Rassam recovered the reliefs making up the &quot;Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal&quot;, which were taken from the palace and transported to the British Museum, reaching England in March 1856. Because of scholarly disagreements and rivalries, as well as issues of funding, studies and publications of the finds from Ashurbanipal&#x27;s palace were produced slowly, with the first detailed analyses and studies not being published until the 1930s and 1940s.

Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign was the last time when Assyrian armies campaigned all across the Middle East. He is consequently typically regarded to have been the &quot;last great king of Assyria&quot;. Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign is sometimes considered the apogee of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, though many scholars instead consider the preceding reign of Esarhaddon as such. Whether Ashurbanipal is to blame for the fall of the Assyrian Empire relatively quickly after his death is disputed. J. A. Delaunay, author of the &quot;Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot; entry on Ashurbanipal, writes that the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Ashurbanipal had already begun &quot;exhibiting clear symptoms of impending dislocation and fall&quot;, while Donald John Wiseman, in the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; article on Ashurbanipal, holds that &quot;It is no indictment of his rule that his empire fell within two decades after his death; this was due to external pressures rather than to internal strife&quot;. Gérard Chaliand holds that the fall of the Assyrian Empire should be blamed on Ashurbanipal&#x27;s &quot;mediocre heirs&quot; rather than Ashurbanipal himself; there is however no evidence that his heirs were incompetent rulers. Sinsharishkun, under whom the empire collapsed, was a militarily competent ruler, utilizing the same tactics as his predecessors.&quot;&quot; Eckart Frahm believes the seeds of Assyria&#x27;s fall were sown in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign, in particular through the disconnect between the king and the traditional elite and through Ashurbanipal&#x27;s sack of Babylon.

==== Ashurbanipal in popular culture ====

Ashurbanipal has been the subject of numerous pieces of artwork created in modern times. In 1958, surrealist painter Leonora Carrington painted &quot;Assurbanipal Abluting Harpies&quot;, an oil on canvas at the Israel Museum depicting Ashurbanipal pouring a white substance onto the heads of pigeon-like creatures with human faces. A statue of the king, called &quot;Ashurbanipal&quot;, was created by sculptor Fred Parhad in 1988 and placed on a street near the San Francisco City Hall. The statue cost $100,000 and was described as the &quot;first sizable bronze statue of Ashurbanipal&quot;. It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the Assyrian people on May 29, 1988, Parhad being of Assyrian descent. Some local Assyrians expressed fears that the statue resembled the legendary Mesopotamian hero Gilgamesh more than it resembled the actual Ashurbanipal. Parhad defended the statue as representing Ashurbanipal, though explained that he had taken some artistic liberties.

Ashurbanipal has also made occasional appearances in popular culture in various media. Robert E. Howard wrote a short story entitled &quot;The Fire of Asshurbanipal&quot;, first published in the December 1936 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine, about an &quot;accursed jewel belonging to a king of long ago, whom the Grecians called Sardanapalus and the Semitic peoples Asshurbanipal&quot;. &quot;The Mesopotamians&quot;, a 2007 song by They Might Be Giants, mentions Ashurbanipal alongside Sargon, Hammurabi, and Gilgamesh. Ashurbanipal was used as the ruler of the Assyrians in the game &quot;Civilization V&quot;.

Ashurbanipal once more entered the global spotlight and garnered increased fame in 2018, when reliefs from his reign were exhibited at the British Museum in the exhibition &quot;I am Ashurbanipal&quot; (8 November 2018 – 21 February 2019). The exhibition was well received, particularly due to its use of inventive technology, such as using lights to illustrate how many of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reliefs would have been painted in his lifetime, and its acknowledgement of the colonialist history of the collection itself. There was however also substantial controversy associated with the exhibition due to its sponsorship by the oil and gas company BP, involved in Middle Eastern oil since the early 20th century. The opening of the exhibition in November 2018 was met with protests, with protesters chanting slogans relating to BP&#x27;s exploitation of Iraqi natural resources and pretending to sip oil-contaminated champagne.

== Titles ==
In an inscription on a cylinder dated to 648, Ashurbanipal used the following titles:

A similar titulature is used on one of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s many tablets:

A longer variant is presented on one of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s building inscriptions in Babylon:

<text>Xu Huang () (died 227), courtesy name Gongming, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He later served in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period under the first two rulers, Cao Pi and Cao Rui, before his death at the start of Cao Rui&#x27;s reign. Xu Huang is best noted for breaking the siege at the Battle of Fancheng in 219 by routing the enemy commander Guan Yu on the field.

Chen Shou, who wrote the third-century historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, named Xu Huang as one of the Five Elite Generals of Cao Wei, alongside Yu Jin, Zhang He, Yue Jin and Zhang Liao.

==Early life and service under Yang Feng==
Xu Huang was born in Yang County (楊縣), Hedong Commandery, which is located southeast of present-day Hongtong County, Shanxi, in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He served as a minor official in the commandery office in his youth. Later, he became a subordinate of Yang Feng, a former White Wave Bandit who later became a general under the Han central government. Xu Huang later followed Yang Feng to attack rebels and was commissioned as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) as a reward for his efforts.

Between 192 and 195, Li Jue and Guo Si controlled the Han central government and held the figurehead Emperor Xian hostage in the imperial capital, Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi). In 195, internal conflict broke out between Li Jue and Guo Si, whose respective factions started warring with each other in the streets of Chang&#x27;an. Yang Feng and Xu Huang were Li Jue&#x27;s subordinates at the time. In the same year, Xu Huang managed to convince Yang Feng to escort Emperor Xian from Chang&#x27;an back to the old Han imperial capital, Luoyang. After Emperor Xian made it safely to Anyi County (安邑縣; west of present-day Xia County, Shanxi), he rewarded Xu Huang by granting him the peerage of a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯).

After they returned to Luoyang with Emperor Xian, internal conflict broke out between the generals Han Xian and Dong Cheng, who were among those who escorted the emperor back to Luoyang. During this time, Xu Huang persuaded Yang Feng to summon the warlord Cao Cao to Luoyang to help them deal with the crisis and protect the emperor. In early 196, Cao Cao and his troops showed up in Luoyang and fetched Emperor Xian to their base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which became the new Han imperial capital. Yang Feng initially wanted to heed Xu Huang&#x27;s suggestion and join Cao Cao, but ultimately refused and went his own way. Xu Huang followed him.

In late 196, after Cao Cao defeated Yang Feng in battle at Liang State (梁國; around present-day Shangqiu, Henan), Xu Huang pledged allegiance to Cao Cao.

==Cao Cao&#x27;s campaigns in central and northern China==
Cao Cao sent Xu Huang with an army to attack rebels at Juan County (卷縣; west of present-day Yuanyang County, Henan) and Yuanwu County (原武縣; present-day Yuanyang County, Henan). Xu Huang defeated them and was promoted to Major-General (裨將軍).

During the battles between Cao Cao and Lü Bu in Xu Province in 198, Xu Huang attacked and defeated Lü Bu&#x27;s subordinates Zhao Shu (趙庶) and Li Zou (李鄒). With aid from Shi Huan, he also defeated and killed Sui Gu (眭固) in Henei Commandery (河內郡; around present-day Jiaozuo, Henan).

In the year 200, during the Battle of Guandu between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao, Xu Huang participated in the early skirmishes at Boma (白馬; near Hua County, Henan) and Yan Ford (延津; present-day Yanjin County, Henan) where he helped to defeat the warlord Liu Bei – who had joined Yuan Shao after losing Xu Province – and Yuan Shao&#x27;s generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou. He was promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) for his achievements, and later joined Cao Hong in eliminating rebels led by Zhu Bi (祝臂) at Yinjiang (氵隱 疆; southwest of present-day Xuchang, Henan).

Yuan Shao had stored his supplies at a depot in Gushi (故市; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan). Cao Cao sent Xu Huang and Shi Huan to attack this position. They defeated the defenders at Gushi and burnt down Yuan Shao&#x27;s grain carts, forcing Yuan Shao to call for relief supplies in response to this raid. Xu Huang received the title of a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯) for his contributions.

A few years later, Xu Huang joined Cao Cao on a campaign against the heirs of Yuan Shao, who had died in 202. In 203, Han Fan (韓範), the Prefect of Yiyang County (易陽縣; northeast of present-day Handan, Hebei), pretended to surrender to Cao Cao while buying time to strengthen his defences. Xu Huang then wrote a letter to Han Fan, tied it to an arrow and fired it into the county. Han Fan became convinced after reading Xu Huang&#x27;s letter and decided to surrender Yiyang County without putting up resistance.

Before the fall of Yiyang County, Xu Huang went to see Cao Cao and asked him to refrain from massacring the population after Han Fan surrendered. The rationale of their final decision was entirely based on tactical consideration, which was to induce other enemy territories into voluntarily surrendering by setting an example. Cao Cao approved Xu Huang&#x27;s suggestion.

Xu Huang later set up an ambush and routed the Yuans&#x27; forces at Maocheng (毛城), defeated Yuan Tan at the Battle of Nanpi, and suppressed a revolt in Pingyuan Commandery (平原郡; around present-day Dezhou, Shandong). He also participated in Cao Cao&#x27;s campaign against Yuan Shang, Yuan Xi and the Wuhuan tribes which led to the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. Xu Huang was further promoted to General Who Sweeps Across the Wilderness (橫野將軍) for his contributions in battle.

==Battle of Jiangling==
In 208, Xu Huang followed Cao Cao to pacify Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), and participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209. When Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat at Red Cliffs, Xu Huang was ordered to stay behind with Cao Ren in Jiangling County to resist attacks by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces.

During this time, Xu Huang was stationed at Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei) and he defeated opposing forces in Zhonglu (中廬), Linju (臨沮) and Yicheng (宜城) counties. During the Battle of Jiangling, he joined Man Chong in attacking Guan Yu at Han Ford (漢津), and Cao Ren in resisting attacks by Zhou Yu at Jiangling.

==Cao Cao&#x27;s northwestern campaigns==
In 210, Xu Huang led his troops to attack rebels in Taiyuan Commandery (太原郡; around present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi), besieged them in Daling County (大陵縣; northeast of present-day Wenshui County, Shanxi), and defeated and killed the rebel leader Shang Yao (商曜).

In 211, when Han Sui and Ma Chao led a coalition of northwestern warlords to start an uprising in Liang Province (covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu), Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to move to Fenyin County (汾陰縣; southwest of present-day Wanrong County, Shanxi) and pacify the people in Hedong Commandery. He also awarded Xu Huang gifts of cattle and alcohol, and allowed him to repair and clean up his ancestors&#x27; tombs.

When Cao Cao led his forces to Tong Pass to engage the coalition, he became worried that he could not cross the Wei River to attack the enemy so he consulted Xu Huang for advice. Xu Huang suggested to Cao Cao to send him north and cross the Yellow River via Puban Ford to circumvent Tong Pass from the west of the river.

Cao Cao approved Xu Huang&#x27;s plan and sent him and Zhu Ling to lead 4,000 troops across the river. They crossed Puban and started pitching camps, but before the defence fortification was completed, one of the coalition members, Liang Xing (梁興), discovered their presence and led some 5,000 troops to attack them. Xu Huang and Zhu Ling managed to hold off Liang Xing and allow Cao Cao and his remaining forces to cross the river.

After Cao Cao&#x27;s victory at Tong Pass, he sent Xu Huang and Xiahou Yuan to pacify the various Di tribes in Yumi County (隃麋縣; east of present-day Qianyang County, Shaanxi) and Qian County (汧縣; south of present-day Long County, Shaanxi). Xu Huang and Xiahou Yuan later rendezvoused with Cao Cao&#x27;s main army at Anding Commandery (安定郡; around present-day Zhenyuan County, Gansu). After Cao Cao had returned to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei), he sent Xu Huang and Xiahou Yuan again to suppress revolts in Fu County (鄜縣; southwest of present-day Huangling County, Shaanxi) and Xiayang County (夏陽縣; southwest of present-day Hancheng, Shaanxi), where they defeated Liang Xing and forced some 3,000 civilian households into submission.

When Cao Cao embarked on another campaign in western China to attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong, he sent Xu Huang with a separate force to pacify the Di tribes living in Du (櫝) and Chouyi (仇夷) mountains. Xu Huang succeeded and was promoted to General Who Pacifies Bandits (平寇將軍). Later, Xu Huang also lifted rebels&#x27; siege on Zhang Shun (張順), one of Cao Cao&#x27;s officers, and defeated the rebel leader Chen Fu (陳福) and destroyed some 30 rebel camps.

==Hanzhong Campaign==
Cao Cao returned to Ye (in present-day Handan, Hebei) after his victory over Zhang Lu at the Battle of Yangping in 215. He left Xu Huang and Xiahou Yuan behind to defend Hanzhong Commandery against attacks by Liu Bei.

During this time, Liu Bei sent Chen Shi to lead troops to cut off Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s supply routes at Mamingge (馬鳴閣), Hanzhong&#x27;s main communication line. Xu Huang led a separate detachment to launch a fierce attack on Chen Shi and defeated him. The casualty rate on Chen Shi&#x27;s side was very high as many of his soldiers were forced to jump off the cliff during the attack.

Cao Cao was delighted when he heard of the victory and he gave orders to Xu Huang: &quot;This pass is a crucial gateway into Hanzhong. Liu Bei intends to isolate the pass and then move on to conquer Hanzhong. You have done well in foiling the enemy&#x27;s attempt.&quot; Cao Cao then personally led reinforcements to Hanzhong Commandery to counter Liu Bei&#x27;s advances.

==Battle of Fancheng==
Xu Huang&#x27;s most glorious moment in his military career came at the Battle of Fancheng in 219. When Fancheng (樊城; in present-day Xiangyang, Hubei) and Xiangyang were besieged by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, Cao Cao first sent Yu Jin to lead a relief force to lift the siege but Yu Jin&#x27;s seven armies were destroyed by a flood. Cao Cao then ordered Xu Huang to lead a second relief force to lift the siege. Cao Ren, the general defending Fancheng, and Lü Chang (呂常), who defended Xiangyang, were both under siege for months.

Knowing that most of his soldiers were composed of new recruits without training, Xu Huang did not go straight into battle but camped behind the enemy at Yanglingbei (陽陵陂; northwest of present-day Xiangyang, Hubei) to impose a deterrent effect. In the meantime, Cao Cao sent subordinates Xu Shang (徐商) and Lü Jian (呂建) to assist Xu Huang and instructed Xu Huang to advance only when Xu Shang, Lü Jian and all other reinforcements had arrived.

At the time, Guan Yu had set up a camp at Yancheng (偃城; north of present-day Xiangyang, Hubei). When Xu Huang showed up, he ordered his troops to pretend to dig trenches around Yancheng to fool the enemy into thinking that they were trying to cut off the supply routes leading to Yancheng. The enemy fell for his ruse, burnt down their camp and abandoned their position, thus allowing Xu Huang to gain a foothold at Yancheng. After capturing Yancheng, Xu Huang pressed on and set up two linked camps about 30 &quot;zhang&quot;s away from Guan Yu&#x27;s encirclement. Before Xu Huang attacked, Cao Cao sent Yin Shu (殷署), Zhu Gai (朱蓋) and other officers to lead another 12 military units to support him.

Guan Yu&#x27;s encirclement was made up of five camps – one main camp leading the siege and four supporting camps. Xu Huang deliberately spread news that he was going to attack the main camp to trick Guan Yu into strengthening his defences at the main camp. In the meantime, he secretly sent his forces to attack the four supporting camps and succeeded in destroying them. When Guan Yu saw that the four camps were down, he personally led 5,000 troops to engage the enemy. Xu Huang launched a fierce attack on Guan Yu and succeeded in defeating him and lifting the siege on Fancheng. During Xu Huang&#x27;s attack, many of Guan Yu&#x27;s soldiers panicked and fled towards the nearby Han River, where they drowned.

When Cao Cao heard of the victory, he praised Xu Huang: &quot;The enemy formation was very thick, yet you managed to achieve victory and destroyed their camps and killed so many of their men. I have fought in battles for over 30 years, but I have never heard of any person in history who attempted to break a siege by launching a direct attack on the enemy&#x27;s encirclement. The situation at Fancheng and Xiangyang was much worse than that at Ju and Jimo. Your achievements are comparable to those of Sun Wu and Rangju.&quot;

The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; (蜀記) recorded an incident about Xu Huang meeting Guan Yu on the battlefield. Xu Huang had a close personal friendship with Guan Yu. They often chatted about other things apart from military affairs. When they met again at Fancheng, Xu Huang gave an order to his men: &quot;Whoever manages to take Guan Yunchang&#x27;s head will be rewarded with 1,000 &quot;jin&quot; of gold.&quot; Guan Yu was shocked and he asked Xu Huang: &quot;Brother, what are you talking about?&quot; Xu Huang replied: &quot;This is an affair of the State.&quot;

Upon Xu Huang&#x27;s return, Cao Cao went seven &quot;li&quot; out of Xuchang to greet him, giving him full credit for securing Fancheng and Xiangyang. Throughout the field reception, the soldiers of other commanders shifted about in order to get a better view of Cao Cao, but Xu Huang&#x27;s men stood stationary in neat files. Seeing this, Cao Cao remarked: &quot;General Xu has truly inherited the style of Zhou Yafu.&quot;

==Service under Cao Pi and Cao Rui==
Following Cao Cao&#x27;s death in March 220, his son Cao Pi succeeded him and inherited his vassal king title as the King of Wei (魏王). Xu Huang continued to be heavily trusted by Cao Pi, and he was appointed General of the Right (右將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Lu District (逯鄉侯).

In late 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei (or Wei) with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, Cao Pi promoted Xu Huang from a district marquis to a county marquis under the title &quot;Marquis of Yang&quot; (楊侯).

Later, Cao Pi ordered Xu Huang and Xiahou Shang to lead an army to attack Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; in present-day northwestern Hubei). After completing his mission, Xu Huang moved to the garrison at Yangping County (陽平縣; present-day Shen County, Shandong), so his marquis title was changed to &quot;Marquis of Yangping&quot; (陽平侯).

Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son Cao Rui as the emperor of Wei. During that time, Xu Huang successfully repelled an invasion on Xiangyang by the Wu general Zhuge Jin. For his contributions, he was awarded another 200 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number to 3,100.

When Xu Huang became seriously ill later, he gave instructions that he was to be given a simple burial after his death. He died in 227 and was granted the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhuang&quot; (壯侯), which literally means &quot;robust marquis&quot;.

Xu Huang&#x27;s son, Xu Gai (徐蓋), inherited his father&#x27;s peerage as the Marquis of Yangping. After Xu Gai died, his son Xu Ba (徐霸) succeeded him as the next Marquis of Yangping. Cao Rui later divided their marquisate and awarded marquis titles to two descendants of Xu Huang.

==Appraisal==
Chen Shou concluded Xu Huang&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; with a brief appraisal: 

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Xu Huang is a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He makes his first appearance in Chapter 13 as a subordinate of Yang Feng. Xu Huang and Yang Feng escort Emperor Xian back to Luoyang after the emperor escapes from Li Jue and Guo Si&#x27;s clutches in Chang&#x27;an.

When Cao Cao comes to Luoyang to fetch the emperor to his base in Xuchang, Yang Feng sends Xu Huang to stop him. Cao Cao knows on first sight that Xu Huang is an extraordinary man so he orders Xu Chu to duel with Xu Huang. Neither side can gain an advantage over each other after 50 bouts, and by then, Cao Cao is very impressed by Xu Huang&#x27;s skill. Not wanting either of the two men to get hurt, Cao Cao calls for Xu Chu to retreat. Man Chong, one of Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates, knows that his lord wants to recruit Xu Huang so he volunteers to persuade Xu Huang to defect to their side. That very night, Man Chong disguises himself as a common soldier, sneaks into Xu Huang&#x27;s tent and manages to convince him to switch allegiance to Cao Cao. Man Chong then suggests that Xu Huang slays Yang Feng to prove his loyalty to Cao Cao, but Xu Huang refuses to kill his former superior out of respect for him.

In the novel, Xu Huang meets his end during the Xincheng Rebellion when he is struck by an arrow in the forehead fired by the rebel leader Meng Da. His men immediately take him back to camp, where the physician removes the arrow and tries to heal him, but Xu Huang eventually dies later that night. The novel states that he is 59 years old at the time of his death. This figure, however, is not supported by any evidence from historical records.

==In popular culture==
Xu Huang is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He also appears in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

<text>Pulse computation is a hybrid of digital and analog computation that uses aperiodic electrical spikes, as opposed to the periodic voltages in a digital computer or the continuously varying voltages in an analog computer. Pulse streams are unclocked, so they can arrive at arbitrary times and can be generated by analog processes, although each spike is allocated a binary value, as it would be in a digital computer.

Pulse computation is primarily studied as part of the field of neural networks. The processing unit in such a network is called a &quot;neuron&quot;.

<text>Eric Flint (February 6, 1947 – July 17, 2022) was an American author, editor, and e-publisher. The majority of his works are alternate history science fiction, but he also wrote humorous fantasy adventures. His works have been listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;Locus&quot; magazine best-seller lists. He was a co-founder and editor of the Baen Free Library.

==Early life and education==
Born in 1947 in Burbank, California, Flint worked on a Ph.D. in history specializing in southern African history. He left his doctoral program to become a political activist in the labor movement. He supported himself from that time until age 50 in a variety of jobs, including longshoreman, truck driver, machinist, and labor union organizer. As a long-time leftist political activist, Flint worked as a member of the Socialist Workers Party.

== Career ==
After winning the fourth quarter of 1993 Writers of the Future contest, he published his first novel in 1997 and moved to full-time writing in 1999.

Shortly afterwards, he became the first librarian of the Baen Free Library and a prominent anti–copy protection activist. He has edited the works of several classic science fiction authors, repackaging their short stories into collections and fix-up novels. This project met commercial success and returned several out-of-print authors to print.

In 2004, he was faced with a persistent drain on his time by fan fiction authors seeking comment on the four-year-old 1632 Tech Manual web forum focused on his 1632 series. In the same year, he suggested to Jim Baen the experimental serialized fan fiction e-zine &quot;The Grantville Gazette&quot;, which also found commercial success. Four of the &quot;Gazette&quot; magazine editions were collated into anthology formats, bought by Jim Baen and brought out in hardcover, paperback, or both formats. The last one purchased remains unpublished. Subsequently, Flint became editor of the new &quot;Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe&quot; science-fiction e-zine while concurrently remaining a creative writer bringing out three to five titles annually. After the death of Jim Baen due to a stroke and completing the contract for the tenth &quot;Grantville Gazette&quot;, Flint founded a new website, grantvillegazette.com, which was modeled on the JBU e-zine. It continued to bring out &quot;The Grantville Gazettes&quot; and increased the publishing rate from four annually to bimonthly, which paid better than standard magazine pay rates.

He lived with his wife Lucille (also an ex-labor organizer) in East Chicago, Indiana.

In 2008, he donated his archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.

Flint was the author guest of honor for the 2010 NASFiC, ReConStruction.

He also participated in The Stellar Guild series published by Phoenix Pick. The series pairs bestselling authors with lesser known authors in science fiction and fantasy to help provide additional visibility to them.

==Electronic publishing==
Eric Flint is noted as a co-founder and editor of the Baen Free Library. The library is an ongoing experiment in electronic publishing where Flint and Jim Baen advocated for the availability of unprotected e-books in multiple online formats. This initiative aimed to assess whether offering free electronic versions of books could boost sales of their print or paid electronic counterparts. As part of the initial phase, Flint has published a series of essays that in form have been part of blog and &quot;letters to the editor&quot; tracking the experiment and championing the practice.

Baen Books have adopted a model of unencrypted e-book publication for all their works, providing works in various common formats. This approach is often applied to the early volumes of ongoing series, with the intent that readers may purchase subsequent installments. New releases are also available as e-books in the same unencrypted formats as the free library through Baen WebScriptions. With this model, subscribers can purchase a monthly &quot;collection&quot; of five bundled works in the release stage of publication. Once the bundle reaches four months from its scheduled release date in print, about half of the work is serialized and available to readers purchasing the &quot;advanced peek&quot;. A month later, the next quarter, followed by the last quarter, available about a month on average ahead of any printed work. The last delivery contains the copyedited e-book version of the book.

In addition to the bundled offerings, &quot;electronic Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs)&quot; can be purchased separately. These followed a successful experiment with an online eMagazine, called the &quot;Grantville Gazette&quot; (see &quot;1632&quot; series). These ARCs are unproofed manuscripts and may contain numerous errors and typos. However these are released before the first part of the monthly bundles. These copies do not include the final proofed version, which is available only in the single or monthly bundle for that book. In March 2007, Flint began acting as publisher of a for-free web-access version of the gazette.

Flint also helmed Jim Baen&#x27;s Universe, an e-zine published from 2006 until 2010.

==Death and tributes==
Flint died on July 17, 2022, at the age of 75 in East Chicago, Indiana.

In February 2024, WordFire Press released an alternative history anthology, &quot;A Bit of Luck: Alternate Histories in Honor of Eric Flint&quot; () as a memorial work. Edited by Lisa Mangum, the anthology included 20 short stories by authors that included Charles E. Gannon and Kevin J. Anderson with profits supporting the endowment fund for Superstars Writing Seminars.

==Bibliography==
==Reception==

To date, six of his books have been included on The New York Times Best Seller list. They are &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair&quot; (2004), &quot;1634: The Baltic War&quot; (2007), &quot;1634: The Bavarian Crisis&quot; (2007), &quot;1636: The Kremlin Games&quot; (2013), &quot;Torch of Freedom&quot; (2009), and &quot;Cauldron of Ghosts&quot; (2014).

&quot;1635: The Papal Stakes&quot; (2012), &quot;The Crucible of Empire&quot; (2010), and &quot;Threshold&quot; (2010) were listed on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; Best-Selling Books list for Hardcover Science Fiction.

&quot;Cauldron of Ghosts&quot; (2014) was listed on &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Best-Selling Books list for Hardcover Fiction.

Almost all of Flint&#x27;s books sold well enough to get listed on the various &quot;Locus&quot; Bestsellers Lists with some titles listed multiple times and a few even reached the top spot for the month.

== Awards and honors ==

Flint was awarded the 2008 Dal Coger Memorial Hall of Fame Award primarily for his &quot;River of War&quot; series.

In 2018, he received a Special Sidewise Award for Alternate History for his encouragement of the genre of alternate history through his support of the community and writers developed around his 1632 series.

Several months after his death, Flint received the 2023 Best Alt-History award for &quot;1812: The Rivers of War&quot; and the 2023 Frank Herbert Lifetime Achievement Award from The Helicon Society.

<doc id="319114" wikidata="Q317846" url="?curid=319114" title="Lü Bu">
<text>Lü Bu (; died 7 February 199), courtesy name Fengxian, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of Imperial China. Originally a subordinate of a minor warlord Ding Yuan, he betrayed and murdered Ding Yuan and defected to Dong Zhuo, the warlord who controlled the Han central government in the early 190s. In 192, he turned against Dong Zhuo and killed him after being instigated by Wang Yun and Shisun Rui (), but was later defeated and driven away by Dong Zhuo&#x27;s followers.

From 192 to early 195, Lü Bu wandered around central and northern China, consecutively seeking shelter under warlords such as Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao, and Zhang Yang. In 194, he managed to take control of Yan Province from the warlord Cao Cao with help from defectors from Cao&#x27;s side, but Cao took back his territories within two years. In 195, Lü Bu turned against Liu Bei, who had offered him refuge in Xu Province, and seized control of the province from his host. Although he had agreed to an alliance with Yuan Shu earlier, he severed ties with him after Yuan declared himself emperor – treason against Emperor Xian of Han – and joined Cao and others in attacking the pretender. However, in 198, he sided with Yuan Shu again and came under attack by the combined forces of Cao and Liu, resulting in his defeat at the Battle of Xiapi in 199. He was captured and executed by strangulation on Cao&#x27;s order. 

Although Lü Bu is described in historical and fictional sources as an exceptionally mighty warrior, he was also notorious for his unstable behaviour. 
He switched allegiances erratically and freely betrayed his allies. He was always suspicious of others and could not control his subordinates. All these factors ultimately led to his downfall. In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the details of his life are dramatized and some fictitious elements – including his romance with the fictional maiden Diaochan – are added to portray him as a nearly unchallenged warrior who was also a ruthless and impulsive brute bereft of morals.

==Historical sources on Lü Bu&#x27;s life==
There are two official biographies of Lü Bu. The first one is in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), which was written by Chen Shou in the third century.

In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou&#x27;s original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to Lü Bu&#x27;s biography include: &quot;Yingxiong Ji&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of Heroes and Champions&quot;), by Wang Can; &quot;Xiandi Chunqiu&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of Emperor Xian&quot;), by Yuan Wei; &quot;Wei Shi Chunqiu&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Ruling Family of Wei&quot;), by Sun Sheng; &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot; (&quot;Biography of Cao Man&quot;), by an unknown writer.

The second biography of Lü Bu is in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; (&quot;Houhanshu&quot;), which was compiled by Fan Ye in the fifth century.

==Physical appearance==
No descriptions of Lü Bu&#x27;s physical appearance exist in historical records. It was noted that he specialized in archery and horse-riding, and possessed great physical strength. He was nicknamed &quot;Flying General&quot; (飛將軍) for his martial prowess. He also owned a powerful steed known as the &quot;Red Hare&quot;. The &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot; recorded that there was a saying at the time to describe Lü Bu and the Red Hare: &quot;Among men, Lü Bu; Among steeds, Red Hare)&quot;.

Lü Bu is described as follows in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;: 

==Biography==
===Service under Ding Yuan and defection to Dong Zhuo===
Lü Bu was from Jiuyuan County (九原縣), Wuyuan Commandery (五原郡), which is near present-day Baotou, Inner Mongolia. He was known for his martial valour in Bing Province. When Ding Yuan, the Inspector (刺史) of Bing Province, was appointed as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) by the Han central government and ordered to garrison at Henei Commandery, he recruited Lü Bu as a Registrar (主簿) and treated him kindly.

After the death of Emperor Ling in May 189, Ding Yuan led his troops to the capital Luoyang to assist the general He Jin in eliminating the eunuch faction. He Jin ended up being assassinated by the eunuchs instead, after which the warlord Dong Zhuo led his forces into Luoyang and occupied the capital. Dong Zhuo wanted to kill Ding Yuan and take control of Ding&#x27;s troops, so he induced Lü Bu into betraying Ding and defecting to his side. Lü Bu killed Ding Yuan, cut off his head, and presented it to Dong Zhuo, who had by then seized control of the Han central government. Dong Zhuo appointed Lü Bu as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) and placed much faith and trust in him. He also accepted Lü Bu as a foster son. Lü Bu was later promoted from the position of a Cavalry Commandant to a General of the Household (中郎將). He was also made a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯).

===Service under Dong Zhuo===
In 190, a coalition of warlords led by Yuan Shao initiated a punitive campaign against Dong Zhuo in response to Dong&#x27;s tyranny and monopoly of the central government. Dong Zhuo had deposed Emperor Ling&#x27;s successor, Emperor Shao, earlier that year and replaced him with Emperor Xian, who was actually a puppet ruler under his control. Lü Bu defended Dong Zhuo and fought in battles against the coalition. In one battle at Yangren (陽人; believed to be near present-day Wenquan, Ruzhou, Henan), Dong Zhuo ordered Lü Bu and Hu Zhen to attack Sun Jian (one of the coalition members), but Lü Bu and Hu Zhen could not get along with each other, resulting in disorder in their army. Sun Jian used the opportunity to attack them and forced them to retreat. Within months, the coalition forces had reached the capital Luoyang. Dong Zhuo personally led an army to engage the coalition vanguard, led by Sun Jian, in the area where the tombs of the Han emperors were located, but was defeated and forced to retreat. Sun Jian then passed through Luoyang&#x27;s Xuanyang Gate (宣陽城門), where he attacked Lü Bu and drove him back. Dong Zhuo was alarmed, so he decided to evacuate Luoyang and move the capital to Chang&#x27;an in the west. He sent his troops to pillage Luoyang and force its residents to move to Chang&#x27;an as well, and then had Luoyang destroyed by fire. The coalition did not pursue Dong Zhuo to Chang&#x27;an and eventually dissolved by itself in the following year.

As Dong Zhuo usually behaved rudely in front of other people, he was afraid of being assassinated, hence he often kept Lü Bu by his side as a bodyguard. Dong Zhuo also had a bad temper and was easily agitated. During his outbursts, he threw short &quot;ji&quot;s at Lü Bu, but Lü Bu reacted fast and dodged the weapons. Dong Zhuo&#x27;s anger subsided after that. Lü Bu was very unhappy and he bore a grudge against his foster father. At the same time, Lü Bu was tasked with guarding Dong Zhuo&#x27;s central living quarters, and he had a secret affair with one of Dong&#x27;s maids. He feared that Dong Zhuo would find out and felt very uneasy about it.

Earlier on, Lü Bu had been warmly received by Wang Yun, the Minister over the Masses (司徒), so he went to see Wang and complained about how Dong Zhuo almost killed him. At the time, Wang Yun and another official, Shisun Rui (士孫瑞), were plotting to get rid of Dong Zhuo so they told Lü Bu about their plan and sought his help. Lü Bu said, &quot;But we are father and son!&quot; Wang Yun replied, &quot;Your family name is Lü so you have no blood relations with him. He was not concerned about you at all when you almost died, so where was the father-son bond?&quot; Lü Bu agreed to join them and personally killed Dong Zhuo later. After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death, Wang Yun and Lü Bu took charge of the central government. Lü Bu was appointed General of Vehement Might (奮威將軍) and received the honours equivalent to those received by the Three Ducal Ministers – three high-ranking officials in the Han administration. Emperor Xian also enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Wen (溫侯).

===Expulsion from Chang&#x27;an===

After Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death, his followers in Liang Province, led by Li Jue, Guo Si and others, formed an army to attack Chang&#x27;an when Wang Yun refused to grant them amnesty for their past activities under Dong Zhuo. Guo Si led his men to attack the city&#x27;s north gate, where he met Lü Bu, who told him, &quot;Let&#x27;s not send our soldiers into battle. Instead, let&#x27;s have a man-on-man fight.&quot; Lü Bu then engaged Guo Si in a duel and injured him. Guo Si&#x27;s men saved their superior. Both sides withdrew their forces. Lü Bu was unable to resist the enemy so he eventually abandoned Chang&#x27;an and fled. His defeat and subsequent flight took place 60 days after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death.

Pei Songzhi commented that the &quot;60 days&quot; claim in the original text of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; was erroneous. According to other sources, Lü Bu killed Dong Zhuo on the 23rd day of the fourth month in the third year of the Chuping era (190–193) in Emperor Xian&#x27;s reign, and he fled from Chang&#x27;an on the first day of the sixth month. There were no interpolated dates in between, so Lü Bu could not have spent 60 days in Chang&#x27;an after Dong Zhuo&#x27;s death.

===Seeking shelter under Yuan Shu===
After leaving Chang&#x27;an, Lü Bu, accompanied by a few hundred horsemen and with Dong Zhuo&#x27;s head tied to his saddle, passed through Wu Pass and went to join Yuan Shu in Nanyang Commandery. The &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; and the &quot;Houhanshu&quot; give differing accounts of how Yuan Shu treated Lü Bu. The former claimed that Lü Bu expected to be received warmly because he felt that he had helped Yuan Shu take revenge by slaying Dong Zhuo. However, Yuan Shu detested Lü Bu because of his duplicity so he refused to accept him. The latter stated that Yuan Shu treated Lü Bu generously, but Lü behaved arrogantly as he felt that he deserved better treatment because he had done Yuan a favour by killing Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu also allowed his men to plunder the area. Yuan Shu became worried that Lü Bu would pose a threat to him, and Lü also felt uneasy after he heard that Yuan was suspicious of him, so he left.

===Joining Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang===

After leaving Yuan Shu, Lü Bu then headed to northern China to join Yuan Shu&#x27;s relative, Yuan Shao. He assisted Yuan Shao in attacking Zhang Yan at Changshan. Zhang Yan had thousands of elite soldiers and cavalry. Lü Bu led his subordinates Cheng Lian (成廉) and Wei Yue (魏越) and dozens of riders to raid Zhang Yan&#x27;s camp, killing several enemies and then fighting their way out. They did this three to four times every day continuously for a period of over ten days and eventually defeated Zhang Yan&#x27;s forces.

Lü Bu behaved arrogantly in front of Yuan Shao because he perceived that he had done the Yuans a favour by slaying Dong Zhuo. He belittled Yuan&#x27;s followers and treated them with contempt. He once asked for more soldiers from Yuan Shao but was refused, after which he sent his men to plunder Yuan&#x27;s territories. Yuan Shao was greatly displeased and felt that Lü Bu posed a threat to him. Lü Bu sensed that Yuan Shao was suspicious of him so he wanted to leave northern China and return to Luoyang. Yuan Shao pretended to agree and recommended Lü Bu to take up the appointment of Colonel-Director of Retainers (司隷校尉) while secretly plotting to kill him.

On the day of Lü Bu&#x27;s departure, Yuan Shao sent 30 armoured soldiers to escort him and personally saw him off. Along the journey, Lü Bu stopped and rested inside his tent. That night, Yuan Shao&#x27;s soldiers crept into the tent and killed the person inside, who had covered himself with a blanket, after which they reported that Lü Bu was dead. The following day, Yuan Shao received news that Lü Bu was still alive so he immediately had the gates in his city closed. In fact, Lü Bu had secretly left his tent the previous night without Yuan Shao&#x27;s soldiers knowing, and had ordered one of his men to remain inside as a decoy.

Lü Bu fled to Henei Commandery to join Zhang Yang after his escape. Yuan Shao sent his men to pursue Lü Bu but they were afraid of Lü and did not dare to approach him. Zhang Yang and his subordinates were bribed by Li Jue and Guo Si to kill Lü Bu. When Lü Bu heard about it, he told Zhang Yang, &quot;I&#x27;m from the same province as you. If you kill me, you&#x27;ll become weaker. If you recruit me, you can obtain the same honours and titles as Li Jue and Guo Si.&quot; Zhang Yang pretended to agree to help Li Jue and Guo Si kill Lü Bu but he secretly offered refuge to Lü instead. When Li Jue and Guo Si learnt that Zhang Yang had accepted Lü Bu, they became worried so they sent an imperial decree to Henei in Emperor Xian&#x27;s name, appointing Lü Bu as the Administrator (太守) of Yingchuan Commandery.

The account of Lü Bu&#x27;s association with Zhang Yang in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; differed slightly from that recorded in the &quot;Houhanshu&quot;. The former mentioned that Lü Bu joined Yuan Shao after he was rejected by Yuan Shu, and then he sought shelter under Zhang Yang after Yuan Shao sent assassins to kill him. In the &quot;Houhanshu&quot;, however, it was stated that Lü Bu went to join Zhang Yang after leaving Yuan Shu, and he managed to persuade Zhang to ignore Li Jue and Guo Si&#x27;s urgings to kill him and instead provide him refuge. He left Zhang Yang later and went to join Yuan Shao, but returned to Zhang again after surviving the assassination attempt. On his way to Henei, Lü Bu passed by Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan), where its Administrator, Zhang Miao, received him warmly. Zhang Miao made a pledge of friendship with Lü Bu when he saw him off from Chenliu.

===Battle of Yan Province===
Yuan Shao was furious when he heard that Zhang Miao – whom he had a feud with – had become Lü Bu&#x27;s friend. Around the time, Yuan Shao was still an ally of Cao Cao, so Zhang Miao feared that Cao would combine forces with Yuan to attack him. Besides, Zhang Miao&#x27;s jurisdiction, Chenliu, was in Yan Province, which was under Cao Cao&#x27;s control.

In 194, when Cao Cao left Yan Province to attack Xu Province, Zhang Miao&#x27;s younger brother Zhang Chao (張超), along with Cao&#x27;s subordinates Chen Gong, Xu Si (許汜) and Wang Kai (王楷), started a rebellion. Chen Gong persuaded Zhang Miao to join them in welcoming Lü Bu into Yan Province. With help from the defectors, Lü Bu seized control of Puyang and declared himself the Governor (牧) of Yan Province. The various commanderies and counties in Yan Province responded to Lü Bu&#x27;s call and defected to his side, except for Juancheng, Dong&#x27;e and Fan counties, which still remained under Cao Cao&#x27;s control.

Upon receiving news of the rebellion and Lü Bu&#x27;s intrusion, Cao Cao aborted the Xu Province campaign and led his forces back to Yan Province. The armies of Lü Bu and Cao Cao clashed at Puyang, where Cao was unable to overcome Lü, so both sides were locked in a stalemate for over 100 days. At the time, Yan Province was plagued by locusts and droughts so the people suffered from famine and many had resorted to cannibalism to survive. Lü Bu moved his base from Puyang further east to Shanyang. Within two years, Cao Cao managed to retake all his territories in Yan Province and he later defeated Lü Bu in a battle at Juye County. Lü Bu fled east to Xu Province and took shelter under Liu Bei.

===Warlord of Xu Province===

==== Seizing Xu Province from Liu Bei ====

Lü Bu treated Liu Bei very respectfully when he first met him, and he said, &quot;You and I are both from the northern borders. When I saw the Guandong Coalition rising up against Dong Zhuo, I already wanted to help them eliminate him. However, after I slew Dong Zhuo and left Chang&#x27;an, none of the former coalition members were willing to accept me. They even tried to kill me.&quot; He then brought Liu Bei to his camp, asked Liu to sit on his wife&#x27;s bed, and instructed his wife to pay respect to Liu. He then threw a feast for Liu Bei and called Liu his &quot;younger brother&quot;. Liu Bei knew that Lü Bu was unpredictable and untrustworthy, but he kept quiet and pretended to be friendly towards Lü Bu.

When Liu Bei was governing Xu Province, he was stationed in the provincial capital Xiapi and he drew boundaries with Yuan Shu in the areas around the Huai River. When Yuan Shu learnt that Lü Bu was in Xu Province, he wanted to instigate Lü Bu to help him deal with Liu Bei, so he wrote to Lü Bu: &quot;In the past, Dong Zhuo monopolised state power, harmed the imperial family, and murdered my family. I participated in the campaign against Dong Zhuo but did not manage to kill him. You slew Dong Zhuo and sent me his head. In doing so, you helped me take revenge and salvage my reputation. This was the first favour you did me. When Jin Yuanxiu (金元休) was heading to Yan Province to assume office, Cao Cao defeated and nearly drove him to the point of destruction. Later, you attacked Cao Cao in Yan Province and helped me regain my reputation. This was the second favour you did me. Throughout my life, I have never heard of the existence of Liu Bei, but he started a war with me. With your mighty spirit, you are capable of defeating Liu Bei, and this will be the third favour you do me. With these three favours you did me, I am willing to entrust matters of life and death to you even though I may not be worthy. You have been fighting battles for a long time and you lack food supplies. I hereby send you 200,000 &quot;hu&quot; (斛) of grain and open my doors to you. If they are insufficient, I will continue to provide you a steady flow of supplies. If you need weapons and military equipment, just ask.&quot; Lü Bu was delighted and he agreed to help Yuan Shu attack Xiapi. The contents of Yuan Shu&#x27;s letter, as recorded in the &quot;Houhanshu&quot;, were slightly different and briefer as compared to that recorded in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;.

Lü Bu led his forces to some 40 &quot;li&quot; west of Xiapi. Xu Dan (許耽), who was from Danyang (丹楊) and was serving as a General of the Household (中郎將) under Liu Bei, sent Zhang Kuang (章誑) to meet Lü Bu at night. Zhang Kuang told Lü Bu, &quot;Zhang Yide quarrelled with Cao Bao and killed him. The city is now in a state of chaos. There are 1,000 soldiers from Danyang stationed at the west white gate. When they heard of your arrival, they jumped for joy as if they have been revitalised. The Danyang soldiers will open the west gate for you when you reach there.&quot; Lü Bu mobilised his troops that night and reached Xiapi at dawn, where the Danyang soldiers opened the west gate for him. Lü Bu sat on the viewing platform above the gate and instructed his troops to set fire in the city. They defeated Zhang Fei and his men in battle and captured Liu Bei&#x27;s family, the families of Liu&#x27;s subordinates, and Liu&#x27;s supplies.

Upon receiving news of Lü Bu&#x27;s intrusion, Liu Bei immediately headed back to Xiapi Commandery but most of his troops scattered along the way. With his remaining men, Liu Bei moved eastward to take Guangling Commandery where Yuan Shu&#x27;s forces defeated him. Liu Bei then retreated to Haixi County (海西縣; southeast of present-day Guannan County, Jiangsu). Where, in hunger and desperation, he surrendered to Lü Bu. This took place in around early 196. Lü Bu was displeased that Yuan Shu&#x27;s supplies had not reached him yet, so he led his men to welcome Liu Bei. He appointed Liu Bei as the Inspector (刺史) of Yu Province and ordered him to garrison at Xiaopei, while he declared himself the Governor of Xu Province and remained in Xiapi.

==== Hao Meng&#x27;s Rebellion ====
In July or August 196, Lü Bu&#x27;s subordinate Hao Meng rebelled against him and attacked his office in Xiapi. Lü Bu&#x27;s general Gao Shun suppressed the rebellion with help from Cao Xing – Hao Meng&#x27;s subordinate, who refused to betray Lü Bu – and killed Hao Meng. Later that year, Lü Bu used his archery skill to prevent a battle between Liu Bei and Yuan Shu&#x27;s general Ji Ling from taking place. He had a &quot;ji&quot; erected at the gate of the camp, and proposed, &quot;Gentlemen, watch me fire an arrow at the lower part of the curved blade on the &quot;ji&quot;. If I hit it in one shot, all of you must withdraw your forces and leave. If I don&#x27;t, you can remain here and prepare for battle.&quot; He then raised his bow and fired an arrow at the &quot;ji&quot;, hitting exactly the lower part of the curved blade. Everyone present at the scene was shocked. They said, &quot;General, you possess Heaven&#x27;s might!&quot; The following day, they threw another party and then withdrew their forces.

===Allying with Cao Cao against Yuan Shu===

==== Cancellation of engagement ====
In early 197, Yuan Shu declared himself &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; in Shouchun, the administrative centre of his territories, and founded a Zhong (仲) dynasty. However, his declaration garnered little to no support, and this was deemed an act of treason against the reigning Emperor Xian of the Han dynasty, so Yuan Shu soon found himself the target of attacks by Cao Cao and other warlords who had received orders from the Han imperial court to eliminate the pretender.

Earlier on, Yuan Shu wanted to form an alliance with Lü Bu so he proposed a marriage between his son and Lü Bu&#x27;s daughter. Lü Bu initially agreed. After proclaiming himself emperor, Yuan Shu sent his subordinate Han Yin (韓胤) to meet Lü Bu and escort Lü Bu&#x27;s daughter back to his territory for the marriage. However, Lü Bu changed his mind after Chen Gui convinced him to do so, and after he recalled how Yuan Shu rejected him when he first sought shelter under him. He then sent his men to chase Han Yin&#x27;s convoy, which was on its way back to Shouchun, and retrieve his daughter. He also captured Han Yin and sent him as a prisoner to Xu, where Han Yin was executed.

==== Peace with Cao Cao ====
The &quot;Yingxiong Ji&quot; recorded: 

The main text of the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, however, mentioned that the Han imperial court appointed Lü Bu as General of the Left (左將軍) instead of General Who Pacifies the East (as stated in the &quot;Yingxiong Ji&quot;). Nevertheless, Lü Bu did allow Chen Deng to go to Xu as his representative to thank the imperial court. In Xu, Chen Deng urged Cao Cao to get rid of Lü Bu and agreed to serve as a mole in Xu Province to help Cao Cao eliminate Lü Bu. Chen Deng also received a promotion while his father Chen Gui got a salary increase.

When Chen Deng returned to Xu Province, an angry Lü Bu confronted him, brandished his &quot;ji&quot; at him and said, &quot;Your father advised me to side with Cao Cao and reject Yuan Shu&#x27;s offer. Now, (after following his advice,) I have gained nothing, while you and your father got promoted and rewarded. You must have tricked me! What do you have to say?&quot; Chen Deng maintained his composure and calmly replied, &quot;When I met Cao Cao, I told him, &#x27;You should treat the General (Lü Bu) in the same way you raise a tiger. Feed it well with meat. If it is not well-fed, it will attack people.&#x27; Cao Cao replied, &#x27;You&#x27;re wrong. He&#x27;s like a hawk. If it is hungry, it will hunt for you. If it is well-fed, it will fly away.&#x27; That was what we talked about.&quot; Lü Bu&#x27;s anger subsided.

===War against Yuan Shu===

Yuan Shu was furious that Lü Bu reneged on his word, so he allied with Han Xian and Yang Feng, and sent his general Zhang Xun (張勳) to attack Lü Bu. Lü Bu asked Chen Gui, &quot;Yuan Shu sends his forces to attack me because I followed your suggestion. What should I do now?&quot; Chen Gui replied, &quot;The alliance between Han Xian, Yang Feng and Yuan Shu is formed by a loose assembly of their forces. They have not decided on a common plan so they will not last long. They are like chickens tied up together and they cannot move in tandem. My son, Deng, has a plan to separate them.&quot;

Lü Bu heeded Chen Gui&#x27;s advice and sent a letter to Han Xian and Yang Feng, &quot;You two generals escorted the Emperor in Luoyang, while I personally killed Dong Zhuo. We have all accomplished deeds worthy of praise. Yuan Shu has committed treason, so everyone should attack him. Why do you side with the traitor instead and join him in attacking me? We should combine forces to defeat Yuan Shu, help the Emperor eliminate this traitor, and achieve glory. We should not lose this opportunity now.&quot; He also promised to share the spoils of war with them. Han Xian and Yang Feng were pleased and they agreed to help Lü Bu. They defeated Zhang Xun at Xiapi and captured Qiao Rui (橋蕤), one of Yuan Shu&#x27;s officers. Yuan Shu&#x27;s forces suffered heavy casualties and many of his soldiers fell into the river and drowned.

Lü Bu, Han Xian and Yang Feng later led their forces to attack Shouchun, the capital of Yuan Shu&#x27;s territories, travelling on both land and water. They plundered the lands along their journey. By the time they reached Zhongli (鍾離; around present-day Chuzhou, Anhui), they had made much gains so they retreated. Before crossing the Huai River back to the north, Lü Bu left Yuan Shu a letter: &quot;You think that your army is powerful and you always boast of having mighty warriors under your command. You wanted to destroy me, but why did you change your decision every time? I may not be courageous, but I have dominated the Huainan region. Within a short period of time, you have become like a rat scurrying for shelter in Shouchun and you cannot emerge again. Where are your mighty warriors? You enjoy telling lies to everyone, but you cannot make everyone believe you. Since ancient times, people have employed the technique of sowing discontent between their enemies to overcome them. I am not the first person to use this strategy. I am still nearby so I can wait for your response.&quot; After Lü Bu crossed the Huai River, Yuan Shu personally led 5,000 soldiers to the riverbank. Lü Bu&#x27;s forces, which were on the opposite end, laughed at their enemy and retreated.

===Conflict with Zang Ba===
Around the time, Xiao Jian (蕭建) served as the Chancellor (相) of Langya State and was stationed in Ju County. Xiao Jian, a conservative man, did not have any contact with Lü Bu. Lü Bu wrote to Xiao Jian: &quot;Initially, everyone throughout the Empire took up arms for the purpose of eliminating Dong Zhuo. I killed Dong Zhuo and headed east, where I hoped to be able to borrow troops and return west to defend the Emperor and restore the capital Luoyang. However, the warlords were fighting among themselves and none of them were concerned about the state. I am from Wuyuan (五原), which is located more than 5,000 &quot;li&quot; away from Xu Province and is somewhere in the northwestern border. As of now, I came here not to fight for the southeastern lands. Ju and Xiapi are not far from each other so it is easy to maintain communication between them. You behave like you are an emperor in a commandery and a king in a county! In the past, when Yue Yi attacked the Qi state, he conquered over 70 cities in Qi, except for Ju and Jimo because of Tian Dan. I am not Yue Yi, and neither are you Tian Dan. You can seek the counsel of wise men on this letter.&quot; After receiving Lü Bu&#x27;s letter, Xiao Jian ordered Ji Jian (齎牋) to present five fine steeds as gifts to Lü Bu.

Zang Ba defeated Xiao Jian later and seized possession of his resources. When Lü Bu heard that, he wanted to lead his forces to attack Zang Ba in Ju County, but Gao Shun advised him against it, &quot;General, you&#x27;ve earned yourself widespread fame for killing Dong Zhuo. Even if you remain in your current position, those near and far will still be afraid of you. You shouldn&#x27;t be so reckless as to personally lead your men into battle. If you lose, the damage to your reputation won&#x27;t be minimal.&quot; Lü Bu ignored him. Zang Ba heard of Lü Bu&#x27;s violent and plundering ways, so he remained inside Ju County and put up a firm defence against Lü Bu. Lü Bu was unable to conquer Ju County so he withdrew his forces and returned to Xiapi. After that, the generals of Taishan bandits include Zang Ba, Sun Guan, Wu Dun, Yin Li and Chang Xi all submitted to Lü Bu, the power of Lü Bu was significantly stronger. 

===Battle of Xiapi===

==== Conflict in Xiaopei ====
During the year 197, Yang Feng and Han Xian were brigands who raided the area between Yang and Xu provinces and were ordered by Lü Bu to lead their troops to raid Liu Bei&#x27;s supplies. However, Liu Bei successfully lured them into a trap. Yang Feng was killed while Han Xian managed to escape.

Around late 197 or early 198, Lü Bu sided with Yuan Shu. Lu Bu also ordered his soldiers to gather gold and money to buy some military horses however along the way Liu Bei led his troops and managed to capture the gold and money. In response, Lu Bu sent Gao Shun and Zhang Liao to attack Liu Bei at Peicheng. Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to support Liu Bei but Gao Shun defeated Liu Bei, as well as the reinforcements Cao Cao had sent to assist him.

==== Cao Cao&#x27;s army attack Xu Province ====
In the winter of 198, Cao Cao personally led a campaign against Lü Bu and besieged Xiapi. He wrote a letter to Lü Bu, explaining the benefits of submitting and the consequences of putting up resistance. Lü Bu wanted to surrender, but Chen Gong and the others knew that they had already offended Cao Cao (when they betrayed him earlier), so they urged Lü Bu to change his decision.

When Cao Cao&#x27;s army reached Pengcheng, Chen Gong told Lü Bu, &quot;We should attack the enemy now, since our troops have rested well while the enemy is weary. We&#x27;re sure to win.&quot; Lü Bu replied, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we wait for them to attack first? After that we&#x27;ll destroy them in the Si River.&quot; When Cao Cao&#x27;s attacks increased in intensity, Lü Bu went up the White Gate Tower (白門樓; the viewing platform above the main gate in the south of Xiapi) and told his men, &quot;Cao Cao has no intention of finding trouble with you. I should surrender to the wise lord.&quot; Chen Gong said, &quot;The treacherous Cao Cao is no wise lord! Surrendering to him is like hitting a rock with an egg! How can you expect to live (after you surrender)?&quot;

Lü Bu sent Xu Si (許汜) and Wang Kai (王楷) to request urgent aid from Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu said, &quot;Lü Bu refused to send his daughter here, so it&#x27;s expected that he&#x27;ll meet his doom. Why does he seek help from me again?&quot; Xu Si and Wang Kai replied, &quot;If Your Highness doesn&#x27;t save Lü Bu, you&#x27;ll be courting your own doom. If Lü Bu is destroyed, Your Highness will be next.&quot; Yuan Shu then prepared his troops and claimed that he would be sending reinforcements to Lü Bu. In the meantime, Lü Bu thought that Yuan Shu was reluctant to help him because he did not send his daughter to Yuan Shu, so, one night, he tied his daughter to himself and attempted to break out of the siege. However, they encountered Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers, who fired arrows at them, so they had no choice but to return to Xiapi. Lü Bu led some 1,000 riders out of the city to engage the enemy, but lost the battle so he retreated back to Xiapi and did not dare to venture out.

Lü Bu ordered Chen Gong and Gao Shun to defend Xiapi, while he personally led some horsemen to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s supply routes. However, before he left, his wife told him, &quot;General, I know you want to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s supply lines, but Chen Gong and Gao Shun can&#x27;t get along with each other. If you leave, they may not work well together in defending the city. If a mishap occurs, what will become of you, General? I hope you&#x27;ll consider this carefully and not be misled by Chen Gong and the others. When I was in Chang&#x27;an, you already abandoned me, but I managed to return to you because Pang Shu (龐舒) secretly protected me and kept me with him. You don&#x27;t need to worry about me now.&quot; Lü Bu felt gloomy after listening to his wife and could not decide on what to do.

Chen Gong told Lü Bu, &quot;Cao Cao has come a long way and he won&#x27;t be able to last long. General, you can bring some troops with you and set up a camp outside the city, while the others and I will remain behind to defend the city. If the enemy attacks you, I&#x27;ll lead the city&#x27;s soldiers to attack them from behind. If they attack the city, you can reinforce the city from outside. Within ten days, the enemy&#x27;s supplies will be depleted and we can defeat them easily.&quot; Lü Bu agreed with Chen Gong&#x27;s idea. However, Lü Bu&#x27;s wife said, &quot;In the past, the Caos treated Gongtai (Chen Gong) like a newborn child, but he still turned against them and joined you. Now, the way you treat Gongtai is no lesser than how Cao Cao treated him, and you intend to entrust the entire city to him, along with your family, while you venture out alone? If something happens, I won&#x27;t be your wife anymore!&quot; Lü Bu then changed his mind.

==== The betrayal of Hou Cheng ====
Yuan Shu was unable to come to Lü Bu&#x27;s aid. Cao Cao could not conquer Xiapi despite pressing attacks on the city and his men were growing weary. He wanted to abort the campaign and return to Xuchang, but his advisors Guo Jia and Xun You urged him to press on. He then ordered his troops to direct the waters of the Yi (沂) and Si (泗) rivers to flood Xiapi. After a siege lasting three months, the morale of Lü Bu&#x27;s forces fell drastically and his men gradually alienated him. On 7 February 199, Lü Bu&#x27;s subordinates Hou Cheng, Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續) captured Chen Gong and Gao Shun, and then led their troops to surrender to Cao Cao.

Lü Bu and his remaining subordinates went up the White Gate Tower and surrendered when they saw they had been surrounded. The &quot;Houhanshu&quot; recorded that Lü Bu asked his men to kill him and bring his head to Cao Cao but they refused. Lü Bu surrendered to Cao Cao immediately after.

===Downfall and death===

Lü Bu was tied up and brought before Cao Cao. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m being tied up too tightly. Can you loosen the bonds?&quot; Cao Cao replied, &quot;A tiger must be tightly restrained.&quot; Lü Bu then said, &quot;My lord, you dread only me, but now, since I&#x27;ve already submitted to you, you shouldn&#x27;t have any more worries. My lord, why don&#x27;t you spare me and let me help you lead your troops? In this way, you won&#x27;t need to worry about not being able to pacify the Empire.&quot; When Cao Cao showed signs of reconsideration, Liu Bei interjected, &quot;My lord, haven&#x27;t you seen what Lü Bu did to Ding Jianyang and Grand Preceptor Dong?&quot; Cao Cao rubbed his chin. Lü Bu shouted at Liu Bei, &quot;You&#x27;re the most untrustworthy person!&quot;

Additional details about the conversation between Lü Bu and Cao Cao were recorded in other texts and they were later added by Pei Songzhi as annotations to the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;.

The &quot;Yingxiong Ji&quot; recorded: 

The &quot;Xiandi Chunqiu&quot; recorded: 

Cao Cao had Lü Bu executed by hanging, along with Chen Gong, Gao Shun and others. Their dead bodies were later decapitated and their heads sent to the capital Xu and then buried.

Lü Bu&#x27;s final moments recorded in the &quot;Houhanshu&quot; are slightly different from that recorded in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, as the &quot;Houhanshu&quot; combined parts of the main text in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; with the &quot;Xiandi Chunqiu&quot; annotation, but the two accounts are generally similar.

==Appraisal==

==Family==
Not much about Lü Bu&#x27;s family was documented in historical texts, but it is known that he had a wife and a daughter, whose names were not recorded in history. Lü Bu abandoned his wife when he was fleeing from Chang&#x27;an, but his subordinate Pang Shu (龐舒) secretly protected her and kept her with him, and returned her to her husband later. She was most prominently mentioned during the Battle of Xiapi when she cautioned Lü Bu against overly trusting Chen Gong. Lü Bu&#x27;s daughter was initially arranged to be married to Yuan Shu&#x27;s son as part of an alliance between Lü and Yuan, but Lü reneged on his word and took her back when she was on her way for the marriage. When Xiapi was under siege by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, Lü Bu attempted to bring his daughter out of the city so that she could be delivered to Yuan Shu, as he hoped that Yuan would send reinforcements to him after receiving his daughter. However, Lü Bu failed to break out of the siege so he returned to Xiapi with her. The eventual fates of Lü Bu&#x27;s wife and daughter are not known.

In the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Lü Bu had two wives, a concubine, and a daughter. His concubine was Diaochan, a fictional character and Wang Yun&#x27;s foster daughter. She accompanied him after he killed Dong Zhuo and was mentioned to be with him during the Battle of Xiapi. Lü Bu&#x27;s first wife was Lady Yan (嚴氏), who was based on Lü Bu&#x27;s real-life wife (the one mentioned in historical sources). Lü Bu&#x27;s second wife, who was only mentioned by name in the novel, was a fictional daughter of Cao Bao. The role played by Lü Bu&#x27;s daughter in the novel was similar to that of her counterpart in actual history. She was also unnamed in the novel, but she is called &quot;Lü Lingqi&quot; () in video games and popular culture.

== In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; ==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which dramatises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, Lü Bu is portrayed as a nearly invincible warrior but an incapable leader who is further marred by character flaws. While adhering to historical records in the general course of events, Luo exaggerated and sentimentalised many stories about Lü Bu, drawing inspirations from traditional operas and folklore.

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Lü Bu:

* List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms#Lü Bu and Diaochan
* Battle of Xiapi#In fiction

==In popular culture==
Because of his image as an unmatched warrior in traditional folklore and in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Lü Bu is often held in high regard in works based on the Three Kingdoms and even in unrelated works.

Notable actors who have portrayed Lü Bu on screen include: Tong Chun Chung in &quot;The Beauty Diu Sim&quot; (1987); Zhang Guangbei in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Huang Lei in &quot;Lü Bu and Diaochan&quot; (2001); Peter Ho in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Godfrey Gao in &quot;God of War, Zhao Yun&quot; (2016); Yu Shirota in &quot;The Untold Tale of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (2020); Louis Koo in &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (2021). Notable actors who have portrayed Lü Bu on stage include Yang Li-hua in Taiwanese opera &quot;Diaochan and Lü Bu&quot; (1991); Wang Zhiliang in Cantonese opera &quot;Love in War&quot; (2022).

Lü Bu appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s video games based on &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, including the strategy game series of the same title as the novel, the action game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, and &quot;Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty&quot;. In the games, his name is spelled as &quot;Lu Bu&quot; without the double-dot over the &quot;u&quot; in &quot;Lu&quot;. He also appears as a boss in the ARPG published by Koei Tecmo and developed by Team Ninja, Wolong: Fallen Dynasty. Other non-Koei titles in which Lü Bu appear include the Creative Assembly&#x27;s &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;, Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;, Neo Geo&#x27;s &quot;World Heroes 2 Jet&quot;, &quot;Fate/Extra&quot;, &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;, and &quot;Arena of Valor&quot;. Additionally, Lü Bu is referenced as character skins in the games &quot;Overwatch&quot; (Reaper) and &quot;League of Legends&quot; (Jarvan IV).

Lü Bu appears in the video game Fate/EXTRA as a Berserker-class Servant possessed by Rani VIII. He later appears in the same class as a Servant able to be summoned by the protagonist in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. He reappears in Fate/Extella and Fate/Extella Link as a playable Servant.

Lü Bu appears as a girl in the manga-anime &quot;Ikki Tousen&quot;, &quot;Ryofuko-chan&quot;, and &quot;Koihime Musō&quot;. In these media, Lü Bu is usually known by the Japanese name Ryofu Hōsen.

In the collectible card game &quot;&quot;, there is a card named &quot;Lu Bu, Master-at-Arms&quot;, in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

Lü Bu appears as a character in the manga &quot;Record of Ragnarok&quot;, regarded as &quot;The Strongest Hero in the History of Mankind.&quot; He is the first combatant on the human side, and confronts the god Thor in the battle of Ragnarok. His backstory was retold as a bored man with no competition who can match his strength. He is also the main character of the spin-off manga &quot;Ryo Fu Hō Sen Hishōden&quot;. In the anime adaptation of Record of Ragnarok he is voiced in the original Japanese by Tomokazu Seki &amp; in the English dub by Kaiji Tang.

In &quot;The God of Highschool&quot;, Lü Bu appeared as a source of borrowed power for Yu Mira. Mira&#x27;s borrowed power is of the general, which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse (based on Red Hare, the legendary steed of Lü Bu).

Lu Bu is a playable character in the Mobile/PC Game Rise of Kingdoms.

<text>Ernst Eduard Kummer (29 January 1810 – 14 May 1893) was a German mathematician. Skilled in applied mathematics, Kummer trained German army officers in ballistics; afterwards, he taught for 10 years in a &quot;gymnasium&quot;, the German equivalent of high school, where he inspired the mathematical career of Leopold Kronecker.

==Life==
Kummer was born in Sorau, Brandenburg (then part of Prussia). He was awarded a PhD from the University of Halle in 1831 for writing a prize-winning mathematical essay (&quot;De cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis&quot;), which was published a year later.

In 1840, Kummer married Ottilie Mendelssohn, daughter of Nathan Mendelssohn and Henriette Itzig. Ottilie was a cousin of Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Rebecca Mendelssohn Bartholdy, the wife of the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. His second wife (whom he married soon after the death of Ottilie in 1848), Bertha Cauer, was a maternal cousin of Ottilie. Overall, he had 13 children. His daughter Marie married the mathematician Hermann Schwarz. Kummer retired from teaching and from mathematics in 1890 and died three years later in Berlin.

==Mathematics==
Kummer made several contributions to mathematics in different areas; he codified some of the relations between different hypergeometric series, known as contiguity relations. The Kummer surface results from taking the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety by the cyclic group {1, −1} (an early orbifold: it has 16 singular points, and its geometry was intensively studied in the nineteenth century).

Kummer also proved Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for a considerable class of prime exponents (see regular prime, ideal class group). His methods were closer, perhaps, to &quot;p&quot;-adic ones than to ideal theory as understood later, though the term &#x27;ideal&#x27; was invented by Kummer. He studied what were later called Kummer extensions of fields: that is, extensions generated by adjoining an &quot;n&quot;th root to a field already containing a primitive &quot;n&quot;th root of unity. This is a significant extension of the theory of quadratic extensions, and the genus theory of quadratic forms (linked to the 2-torsion of the class group). As such, it is still foundational for class field theory.

Kummer further conducted research in ballistics and, jointly with William Rowan Hamilton he investigated 
ray systems.

<text>The Pinwheel Galaxy (also known as Messier 101, M101 or NGC 5457) is a face-on, counterclockwise Intermediate spiral galaxy located from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781 and was communicated that year to Charles Messier, who verified its position for inclusion in the &quot;Messier Catalogue&quot; as one of its final entries.

On February 28, 2006, NASA and the European Space Agency released a very detailed image of the Pinwheel Galaxy, which was the largest and most detailed image of a galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope at the time. The image was composed of 51 individual exposures, plus some extra ground-based photos.

== Discovery ==
Pierre Méchain, the discoverer of the galaxy, described it as a &quot;nebula without star, very obscure and pretty large, 6&#x27; to 7&#x27; in diameter, between the left hand of Bootes and the tail of the great Bear. It is difficult to distinguish when one illuminates the [grating] wires.&quot;

William Herschel wrote in 1784 that the galaxy was one of several which &quot;...in my 7-, 10-, and 20-feet [focal length] reflectors shewed a mottled kind of nebulosity, which I shall call resolvable; so that I expect my present telescope will, perhaps, render the stars visible of which I suppose them to be composed.&quot;

Lord Rosse observed the galaxy in his 72-inch-diameter Newtonian reflector during the second half of the 19th century. He was the first to make extensive note of the spiral structure and made several sketches.

Though the galaxy can be detected with binoculars or a small telescope, to observe the spiral structure in a telescope without a camera requires a fairly large instrument, very dark skies, and a low-power eyepiece.

== Structure and composition ==

M101 is a large galaxy, with a diameter of 170,000 light-years. By comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of 87,400 light-years. It has around a trillion stars. It has a disk mass on the order of 100 billion solar masses, along with a small central bulge of about 3 billion solar masses. Its characteristics can be compared to those of Andromeda Galaxy.

M101 has a high population of H II regions, many of which are very large and bright. H II regions usually accompany the enormous clouds of high density molecular hydrogen gas contracting under their own gravitational force where stars form. H II regions are ionized by large numbers of extremely bright and hot young stars; those in M101 are capable of creating hot superbubbles. In a 1990 study, 1,264 H II regions were cataloged in the galaxy. Three are prominent enough to receive New General Catalogue numbers—NGC 5461, NGC 5462, and NGC 5471.

M101 is asymmetrical due to the tidal forces from interactions with its companion galaxies. These gravitational interactions compress interstellar hydrogen gas, which then triggers strong star formation activity in M101&#x27;s spiral arms that can be detected in ultraviolet images.

In 2001, the X-ray source P98, located in M101, was identified as an ultra-luminous X-ray source—a source more powerful than any single star but less powerful than a whole galaxy—using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. It received the designation M101 ULX-1. In 2005, Hubble and XMM-Newton observations showed the presence of an optical counterpart, strongly indicating that M101 ULX-1 is an X-ray binary. Further observations showed that the system deviated from expected models—the black hole is just 20 to 30 solar masses, and consumes material (including captured stellar wind) at a higher rate than theory suggests.

It is estimated that M101 has about 150 globular clusters, the same as the number of the Milky Way&#x27;s globular clusters.

== Companion galaxies ==
M101 has six prominent companion galaxies: NGC 5204, NGC 5474, NGC 5477, NGC 5585, UGC 8837 and UGC 9405. As stated above, the gravitational interaction between it and its satellites may have spawned its grand design pattern. The galaxy has probably distorted the second-listed companion. The list comprises most or all of the M101 Group.

==Supernovae and luminous red nova==
Six internal supernovae have been recorded:
* SN 1909A was discovered by Max Wolf in January 1909 and reached magnitude 12.1.
* SN 1951H was discovered by Milton Humason on 1 September 1951 and reached magnitude 17.5.
* SN 1970G (typeII, mag. 11.5) was discovered by Miklós Lovas on 30 July 1970.
* On August 24, 2011, a Type Ia supernova, SN 2011fe, initially designated PTF 11kly, was discovered in M101. It had visual magnitude 17.2 at discovery and reached 9.9 at its peak. 
* On February 10, 2015, a luminous red nova, known as M101 OT2015-1 was discovered in the Pinwheel Galaxy.
* On May 19, 2023, SN 2023ixf was discovered in M101, and immediately classified as a Type II supernova.

<text>A prolate rotator galaxy, or spindle galaxy, is an unusual class of galaxy that is cigar-shaped and rotates around its long axis. A prolate rotator galaxy is an elliptical galaxy in prolate rotation, meaning they possess a significant amount of rotation around their major axis. To create a prolate rotator galaxy, two large spiral galaxies must collide at right angles. One forms the central bar, the other the disk. The bar then dominates the system.

, 20 such galaxies were known. Their existence is also predicted by large-scale cosmological simulations.

<doc id="319126" wikidata="Q192078" url="?curid=319126" title="Lenticular galaxy">
<text>A lenticular galaxy (denoted S0) is a type of galaxy intermediate between an elliptical (denoted E) and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe. Connecting the E galaxies with the S0 galaxies are the ES galaxies with intermediate-scale discs.

==Morphology and structure==
===Classification===


Lenticular galaxies are unique in that they have a visible disk component as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance can be seen in the axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a disk galaxy) distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies &quot;or&quot; by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed axial ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.

Lenticular galaxies are often considered to be a poorly understood transition state between spiral and elliptical galaxies, which results in their intermediate placement on the Hubble sequence. This results from lenticulars having both prominent disk and bulge components. The disk component is usually featureless, which precludes a classification system similar to spiral galaxies. As the bulge component is usually spherical, elliptical galaxy classifications are also unsuitable. Lenticular galaxies are thus divided into subclasses based upon either the amount of dust present or the prominence of a central bar. The classes of lenticular galaxies with no bar are S01, S02, and S03 where the subscripted numbers indicate the amount of dust absorption in the disk component; the corresponding classes for lenticulars with a central bar are SB01, SB02, and SB03.

===Sérsic decomposition===

The surface brightness profiles of lenticular galaxies are well described by the sum of a Sérsic model for the spheroidal component plus an exponentially declining model (Sérsic index of n ≈ 1) for the disk, and often a third component for the bar. Sometimes there is an observed truncation in the surface brightness profiles of lenticular galaxies at ~ 4 disk scalelengths. These features are consistent with the general structure of spiral galaxies. However, the bulge component of lenticulars is more closely related to elliptical galaxies in terms of morphological classification. This spheroidal region, which dominates the inner structure of lenticular galaxies, has a steeper surface brightness profile (Sérsic index typically ranging from n = 1 to 4) than the disk component. Lenticular galaxy samples are distinguishable from the diskless (excluding small nuclear disks) elliptical galaxy population through analysis of their surface brightness profiles.

===Bars===
Like spiral galaxies, lenticular galaxies can possess a central bar structure. While the classification system for normal lenticulars depends on dust content, barred lenticular galaxies are classified by the prominence of the central bar. SB01 galaxies have the least defined bar structure and are only classified as having slightly enhanced surface brightness along opposite sides of the central bulge. The prominence of the bar increases with index number, thus SB03 galaxies, like the NGC 1460 have very well defined bars that can extend through the transition region between the bulge and disk. NGC 1460 is actually the galaxy with one of the largest bars seen among lenticular galaxies. Unfortunately, the properties of bars in lenticular galaxies have not been researched in great detail. Understanding these properties, as well as understanding the formation mechanism for bars, would help clarify the formation or evolution history of lenticular galaxies.

=== Box-shaped bulges ===
NGC 1375 and NGC 1175 are examples of lenticular galaxies that have so-called box-shaped bulges. They are classified as SB0 pec. Box-shaped bulges are seen in edge-on galaxies, mostly spiral, but rarely lenticular.

===Content===
In many respects the composition of lenticular galaxies is like that of ellipticals. For example, they both consist of predominately older, hence redder, stars. All of their stars are thought to be older than about a billion years, in agreement with their offset from the Tully–Fisher relation (see below). In addition to these general stellar attributes, globular clusters are found more frequently in lenticular galaxies than in spiral galaxies of similar mass and luminosity. They also have little to no molecular gas (hence the lack of star formation) and no significant hydrogen α or 21-cm emission. Finally, unlike ellipticals, they may still possess significant dust.

==Kinematics==

===Measurement difficulties and techniques===

Lenticular galaxies share kinematic properties with both spiral and elliptical galaxies. This is due to the significant bulge and disk nature of lenticulars. The bulge component is similar to elliptical galaxies in that it is pressure supported by a central velocity dispersion. This situation is analogous to a balloon, where the motions of the air particles (stars in a bulge&#x27;s case) are dominated by random motions. However, the kinematics of lenticular galaxies are dominated by the rotationally supported disk. Rotation support implies the average circular motion of stars in the disk is responsible for the stability of the galaxy. Thus, kinematics are often used to distinguish lenticular galaxies from elliptical galaxies. Determining the distinction between elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies often relies on the measurements of velocity dispersion (σ), rotational velocity (v), and ellipticity (ε). In order to differentiate between lenticulars and ellipticals, one typically looks at the v/σ ratio for a fixed ε. For example, a rough criterion for distinguishing between lenticular and elliptical galaxies is that elliptical galaxies have v/σ &lt; 0.5 for ε = 0.3. The motivation behind this criterion is that lenticular galaxies do have prominent bulge and disk components whereas elliptical galaxies have no disk structure. Thus, lenticulars have much larger v/σ ratios than ellipticals due to their non-negligible rotational velocities (due to the disk component) in addition to not having as prominent of a bulge component compared to elliptical galaxies. However, this approach using a single ratio for each galaxy is problematic due to the dependence of the v/σ ratio on the radius out to which it is measured in some early-type galaxies. For example, the ES galaxies that bridge the E and S0 galaxies, with their intermediate-scale disks, have a high v/σ ratio at intermediate radii that then drops to a low ratio at large radii.

The kinematics of disk galaxies are usually determined by Hα or 21-cm emission lines, which are typically not present in lenticular galaxies due to their general lack of cool gas. Thus kinematic information and rough mass estimates for lenticular galaxies often comes from stellar absorption lines, which are less reliable than emission line measurements. There is also a considerable amount of difficulty in deriving accurate rotational velocities for lenticular galaxies. This is a combined effect from lenticulars having difficult inclination measurements, projection effects in the bulge-disk interface region, and the random motions of stars affecting the true rotational velocities. These effects make kinematic measurements of lenticular galaxies considerably more difficult compared to normal disk galaxies.

===Offset Tully–Fisher relation===
The kinematic connection between spiral and lenticular galaxies is most clear when analyzing the Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and lenticular samples. If lenticular galaxies are an evolved stage of spiral galaxies then they should have a similar Tully–Fisher relation with spirals, but with an offset in the luminosity / absolute magnitude axis. This would result from brighter, redder stars dominating the stellar populations of lenticulars. An example of this effect can be seen in the adjacent plot. One can clearly see that the best-fit lines for the spiral galaxy data and the lenticular galaxy have the same slope (and thus follow the same Tully–Fisher relation), but are offset by ΔI ≈ 1.5. This implies that lenticular galaxies were once spiral galaxies but are now dominated by old, red stars.

==Formation theories==
The morphology and kinematics of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, suggest a mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. However, some lenticular galaxies are more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they are not merely the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies might result from a galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and might give the newly merged galaxy a disk-like, arm-less appearance. Alternatively, it has been proposed that they grew their disks via (gas and minor merger) accretion events.
It had previously been suggested that the evolution of luminous lenticular galaxies may be closely linked to that of elliptical galaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies, although this latter galaxy harassment scenario has since been queried due to the existence of extremely isolated, low-luminosity lenticular galaxies such as LEDA 2108986.

===Faded spirals===
The absence of gas, presence of dust, lack of recent star formation, and rotational support are all attributes one might expect of a spiral galaxy which had used up all of its gas in the formation of stars. This possibility is further enhanced by the existence of gas poor, or &quot;anemic&quot;, spiral galaxies. If the spiral pattern then dissipated the resulting galaxy would be similar to many lenticulars. Moore et al. also document that tidal harassment – the gravitational effects from other, near-by galaxies – could aid this process in dense regions. The clearest support for this theory, however, is their adherence to slightly shifted version of Tully–Fisher relation, discussed above.

A 2012 paper that suggests a new classification system, first proposed by the Canadian astronomer Sidney van den Bergh, for lenticular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (S0a-S0b-S0c-dSph) that parallels the Hubble sequence for spirals and irregulars (Sa-Sb-Sc-Im) reinforces this idea showing how the spiral–irregular sequence is very similar to this new one for lenticulars and dwarf ellipticals.

===Mergers===

The analyses of Burstein and Sandage showed that lenticular galaxies typically have surface brightness much greater than other spiral classes. It is also thought that lenticular galaxies exhibit a larger bulge-to-disk ratio than spiral galaxies and this may be inconsistent with simple fading from a spiral. If S0s were formed by mergers of other spirals these observations would be fitting and it would also account for the increased frequency of globular clusters. It should be mentioned, however, that advanced models of the central bulge which include both a general Sersic profile and bar indicate a smaller bulge, and thus a lessened inconsistency. Mergers are also unable to account for the offset from the Tully–Fisher relation without assuming that the merged galaxies were quite different from those we see today.

===Disk growth via accretion===
The creation of disks in, at least some, lenticular galaxies via the accretion of gas, and small galaxies, around a pre-existing spheroidal structure was first suggested as an explanation to match the high-redshift compact massive spheroidal-shaped galaxies with the equally compact massive bulges seen in nearby massive lenticular galaxies. In a &quot;downsizing&quot; scenario, bigger lenticular galaxies may have been built first – in a younger universe when more gas was available – and the lower-mass galaxies may have been slower to attract their disk-building material, as in the case of the isolated early-type galaxy LEDA 2108986. Within galaxy clusters, ram-pressure stripping removes gas and prevents the accretion of new gas that might be capable of furthering the development of the disk.

<text>Sally Clark (née Lockyer, 15 August 1964 – 15 March 2007) was an English solicitor who, in November 1999, became the victim of a miscarriage of justice when she was found guilty of the murder of her two infant sons. Clark&#x27;s first son died in December 1996 within a few weeks of his birth, and her second son died in similar circumstances in January 1998. A month later, Clark was arrested and tried for both deaths. The defence argued that the children had died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The prosecution case relied on flawed statistical evidence presented by paediatrician Roy Meadow, who testified that the chance of two children from an affluent family suffering SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He had arrived at this figure by squaring his estimate of a chance of 1 in 8500 of an individual SIDS death in similar circumstances. The Royal Statistical Society later issued a statement arguing that there was no statistical basis for Meadow&#x27;s claim, and expressed concern at the &quot;misuse of statistics in the courts&quot;.

Clark was convicted in November 1999. The convictions were upheld on appeal in October 2000, but overturned in a second appeal in January 2003, after it emerged that Alan Williams, the prosecution forensic pathologist who examined both babies, had failed to disclose microbiological reports that suggested her younger son had died of natural causes. Clark was released from prison having served more than three years of her sentence. Journalist Geoffrey Wansell called Clark&#x27;s experience &quot;one of the great miscarriages of justice in modern British legal history&quot;. As a result of her case, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith ordered a review of hundreds of other cases, and two other women had their convictions overturned. Clark&#x27;s experience caused her to develop severe psychiatric problems and she died in her home in March 2007 from alcohol poisoning.

== Early life ==
Sally Clark was born Sally Lockyer in Devizes, Wiltshire, and was the only daughter of a father who was a senior police officer with Wiltshire Constabulary and a mother who was a hairdresser. She was educated at South Wilts Grammar School for Girls in Salisbury. She studied Geography at Southampton University, and worked as a management trainee with Lloyds Bank and then at Citibank. She married solicitor Steve Clark in 1990, and left her job in the City of London to train in the same profession. She studied Law at City, University of London, and trained at Macfarlanes, a city law firm. She moved with her husband to join the law firm Addleshaw Booth &amp; Co in Manchester in 1994. They bought a house in Wilmslow in Cheshire.

== Conviction for murder ==
Clark&#x27;s first son, Christopher, was born on 22 September 1996. Court documents describe him as a healthy baby. On 13 December Clark called an ambulance to the family home. The baby had fallen unconscious after being put to bed, and was declared dead after being transported to the hospital. Clark had post-natal depression and received counselling at the Priory Clinic, but was in recovery by the time her second son, Harry, was born three weeks premature on 29 November 1997. However, he was also found dead on 26 January 1998, aged 8 weeks. On both occasions, Clark was at home alone with her baby and there was evidence of trauma, which could have been related to attempts to resuscitate them.

Clark and her husband were arrested on 23 February 1998 on suspicion of murdering their children. On the advice of her lawyers she twice refused to answer questions. She was later charged with two counts of murder while the case against her husband was dropped. Clark always denied the charge, and was supported throughout by her husband. During the court proceedings she gave birth to a third son.

Clark was tried at Chester Crown Court, before Mr Justice Harrison and a jury. The 17-day trial began on 11 October 1999. The prosecution, led by Robin Spencer QC, was controversial for its involvement of the paediatrician professor Sir Roy Meadow, former professor of paediatrics at the University of Leeds, who testified at Clark&#x27;s trial that the chance of two children from an affluent family suffering cot death was 1 in 73 million. He likened the probability to the chances of backing an 80–1 outsider in the Grand National four years running, and winning each time.

Home Office pathologist Dr Alan Williams withheld the results of bacteriology tests on Clark&#x27;s second baby which showed the presence of the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; in multiple sites including his cerebro-spinal fluid. During the trial the jury asked specifically if there were any &#x27;blood&#x27; test results for this child. Williams returned to the witness box to deal with their query. He was specifically asked about an entry in the notes referring to &#x27;C&amp;S&#x27; results. These referred to samples taken for culture and sensitivity (bacteriology) tests. In his responses, he failed to reveal the existence of these withheld test results.

Clark was convicted by a 10–2 majority verdict on 9 November 1999, and given the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. She was widely reviled in the press as the murderer of her children. Despite recognition of the flaws in Meadow&#x27;s statistical evidence, the convictions were upheld at appeal in October 2000. She was imprisoned at Styal women&#x27;s prison, near her home in Wilmslow, and then Bullwood Hall women&#x27;s prison in Hockley in Essex. The nature of her conviction as a child-killer, and her background as a solicitor and daughter of a police officer, made her a target for other prisoners. Her husband left his partnership at a Manchester law firm to work as a legal assistant nearer the prison, selling the family house to meet the legal bills from the trial and first appeal.

== Successful second appeal ==
Later, it came to light that microbiological tests showed that Harry had a colonisation of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; bacteria, indicating that he had died from natural causes, but the evidence had not been disclosed to the defence. This exculpatory evidence had been known to the prosecution&#x27;s pathologist, Alan Williams, since February 1998, but was not shared with other medical witnesses, police or lawyers. The evidence was unearthed by her husband from hospital records obtained by the divorce lawyer Marilyn Stowe, who provided her services free of charge because she felt that &quot;something was not right about the case&quot;. It also became clearer that the statistical evidence presented at Clark&#x27;s trial was seriously flawed.

For her second appeal a report regarding the medical evidence was provided by Sam Gulino, a prosecution forensic pathologist for the State of Florida, US. He commented scathingly about the poor quality of the pathologists&#x27; work in these cases:

Her case was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and her convictions were overturned in a second appeal in January 2003. She was released from prison having served more than three years of her sentence.

=== Statistical evidence ===
The first trial was widely criticised for the misrepresentation of statistical evidence, particularly by Meadow. He stated in evidence as an expert witness that &quot;one sudden infant death in a family is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder unless proven otherwise&quot; (Meadow&#x27;s law). He claimed that, for an affluent non-smoking family like the Clarks, the probability of a single cot death was 1 in 8,543, so the probability of two in the same family was around &quot;1 in 73 million&quot; (8543 × 8543). Given that there are around 700,000 live births in Britain each year, Meadow argued that a double cot death would be expected to occur once every hundred years.

In October 2001, the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) issued a public statement expressing its concern at the &quot;misuse of statistics in the courts&quot;. It noted that there was &quot;no statistical basis&quot; for the &quot;1 in 73 million&quot; figure. In January 2002, the RSS wrote to the Lord Chancellor pointing out that &quot;the calculation leading to 1 in 73 million is false&quot;.

Meadow&#x27;s calculation was based on the assumption that two SIDS deaths in the same family are independent. The RSS argued that &quot;there are very strong reasons for supposing that the assumption is false. There may well be unknown genetic or environmental factors that predispose families to SIDS, so that a second case within the family becomes much more likely than would be a case in another, apparently similar, family.&quot; The prosecution did not provide any evidence to support its different assumption. In a 2004 article in &quot;Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology&quot;, Professor of Mathematics Ray Hill of Salford University concluded, using extensive SIDS statistics for England, that &quot;after a first cot death the chances of a second become greatly increased&quot; by a dependency factor of between 5 and 10.

The ruling was also subject to a statistical error known as the &quot;prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy&quot;. Many press reports of the trial reported that the &quot;1 in 73 million&quot; figure was the probability that Clark was innocent. However, even if the &quot;1 in 73 million&quot; figure were valid, this should not have been interpreted as the probability of Clark&#x27;s innocence. In order to calculate the probability of Clark&#x27;s innocence, the jury needed to weigh up the relative likelihood of the two competing explanations for the children&#x27;s deaths. In other words, murder was not the only alternative explanation for the deaths in the way that one might have inferred from asserted probability of double SIDS. Although double SIDS is very rare, double infant murder is likely to be rarer still, so the probability of Clark&#x27;s innocence was quite high. Hill calculated the odds ratio for double SIDS to double homicide at between 4.5:1 and 9:1, that is double SIDS is twice as likely as double murder.

Hill raised a third objection to the &quot;1 in 73 million&quot; figure. Meadow arrived at the 1 in 8,500 figure by taking into account three key characteristics possessed by the Clark family, all of which make SIDS less likely. However, Hill said that Meadow &quot;conveniently ignored factors such as both the Clark babies being boys – which make cot death more likely&quot;. Hill also argued:

During the second appeal, the court noted that Meadow&#x27;s calculations were subject to a number of qualifications, but &quot;none of these qualifications were referred to by Professor Meadow in his evidence to the jury and thus it was the headline figures of 1 in 73 million that would be uppermost in the jury&#x27;s minds&quot;. The appeal court concluded that &quot;the evidence should never have been before the jury in the way that it was when they considered their verdicts&quot;. The judges continued, &quot;we rather suspect that with the graphic reference by Professor Meadow to the chances of backing long odds winners of the Grand National year after year it may have had a major effect on [the jury&#x27;s] thinking notwithstanding the efforts of the trial judge to down play it&quot;.

== Aftermath ==

Clark&#x27;s release in January 2003 prompted the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to order a review of hundreds of other cases. Two other women convicted of murdering their children, Donna Anthony and Angela Cannings, had their convictions overturned and were released from prison. Trupti Patel, who was also accused of murdering her three children, was acquitted in June 2003. In each case, Roy Meadow had testified about the unlikelihood of multiple cot deaths in a single family.

Meadow was struck off the medical register by the General Medical Council in 2005 for serious professional misconduct. It was during the GMC hearing that, when questioned directly, he made his first public apology for the effect of his &#x27;misleading&#x27; evidence. He cited &#x27;legal advice&#x27; and &#x27;professional etiquette&#x27; as the reasons for the delay. Then current GMC professional conduct guidance did not support his &#x27;professional etiquette&#x27; reason. He was reinstated in 2006 after he appealed and the court ruled (2 to 1) that his actions in court had amounted to misconduct though not serious enough to warrant him being struck off. The senior judge on the panel, Master of the Rolls Sir Anthony Clarke, dissented from the view of his two colleagues. In his opinion Meadow&#x27;s actions had amounted to serious professional misconduct.

In June 2005, Alan Williams, the Home Office pathologist who conducted the postmortem examinations on both the Clark babies, was banned from Home Office pathology work and coroners&#x27; cases for three years after the General Medical Council found him guilty of &quot;serious professional misconduct&quot; in the Clark case. At the same time he had chosen to withhold evidence of infection as a possible cause of the death of the second baby, he changed his original opinion regarding the first baby from death caused by lower respiratory infection to unnatural death by smothering. He failed to give any good reason for this change in opinion and his competence was called into question. His conduct was severely criticised by other experts giving evidence and opinion to the court and in the judicial summing up of the successful second appeal. He was given the opportunity to address the court to explain his decision to withhold the laboratory results. He declined to do so. The decision of the GMC was upheld by the High Court in November 2007. Earlier that year he had successfully appealed against the decision to ban him from performing Home Office postmortem examinations; the ban was replaced by an 18-month suspension which by then had passed.

== Death ==

The nature of Sally Clark&#x27;s wrongful conviction as a child-killer, and her background as a solicitor and daughter of a police officer, made her a target for other prisoners. According to her family, Clark was unable to recover from the effects of her conviction and imprisonment. After her release, her husband said she would &quot;never be well again&quot;. A family spokesman stated &quot;Sally was unable to come to terms with the false accusations, based on flawed medical evidence and the failures of the legal system, which debased everything she had been brought up to believe in and which she herself practised.&quot; It was stated in the later inquest that she was diagnosed with a number of severe psychiatric problems, &quot;these problems included enduring personality change after catastrophic experience, protracted grief reaction and alcohol dependency syndrome.&quot; Clark was found dead in her home in Hatfield Peverel in Essex on 16 March 2007. It was originally thought that she had died of natural causes, but an inquest ruled that she had died of acute alcohol intoxication, though the coroner stressed that there was no evidence that she had intended to commit suicide.

<text>The French paradox is an apparently paradoxical epidemiological observation that French people have a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats, in apparent contradiction to the widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD. The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower.

It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in part by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in part by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns that were adopted years earlier.

==Identifying and quantifying the French paradox==

In 1991, Serge Renaud, a scientist from Bordeaux University, France—considered today the father of the phrase—presented the results of his scientific study into the term and actual scientific data behind the perception of the phrase. This was followed by a public documentary broadcast on the American CBS News television channel, &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In 1991, Renaud extended his studies in partnership with then junior researchers, cardiologist Michel de Lorgeril and dietician Patricia Salen. The three enhanced Renaud&#x27;s study, with their paper concluding that: a diet based on southwestern Mediterranean cuisine (which is high in omega-3 oils, antioxidants and includes &quot;moderate consumption&quot; of red wine) created lower cases of cancer, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease; partly through increasing HDL cholesterol whilst reducing LDL cholesterol.

== Statistical illusion hypothesis ==
In 1999, Malcolm Law and Nicholas Wald published a study in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, using data from a 1994 study of alcohol and diet to explain how the French paradox might actually be an illusion, caused by two statistical distortions.

First, Law and Wald attributed about 20% of the difference in the observed rates of CHD between France and the United Kingdom to the under-certification of CHD in France, relative to the UK.

Second, Law and Wald presented a time-lag hypothesis: if there were a delay in serum cholesterol concentrations increasing and a subsequent increase in ischaemic heart disease mortality, then the current rate of mortality from CHD is more likely to be linked to past levels of serum cholesterol and fat consumption than to current serum cholesterol levels and patterns of fat consumption. They wrote,
We propose that the difference is due to the time lag between increases in consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations and the resulting increase in mortality from heart disease—similar to the recognised time lag between smoking and lung cancer. Consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations increased only recently in France but did so decades ago in Britain.

Evidence supports this explanation: mortality from heart disease across countries, including France, correlates strongly with levels of animal fat consumption and serum cholesterol in the past (30 years ago) but only weakly to recent levels. Based on past levels, mortality data for France are not discrepant
In addition, the French population has become increasingly overweight. A study published by the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) revealed an increase in obesity from 8.5% in 1997 to 14.5% in 2009, with women showing a greater tendency toward obesity than men.

==Impact==

===Cultural impact===
The overall impact of the popular perception, in the English-speaking world, that the French paradox is a real phenomenon, has been to give added credibility to health claims associated with specific French dietary practices.

This was seen most dramatically when, in 1991, an early account of the then-novel concept of the French paradox was aired in the United States on &quot;60 Minutes.&quot; The broadcast left the impression that France&#x27;s high levels of red wine consumption accounted for much of the country&#x27;s lower incidence of cardiac disease. Within a year, the consumption of red wine in the United States had increased by 40% and some wine sellers began promoting their products as &quot;health food.&quot;

The cultural impact of the French paradox can be seen in the large number of book titles in the diet-and-health field that purport to give the reader access to the secrets behind the paradox:
* &quot;The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss&quot; (William Clower, 2003);
* &quot;The French Don&#x27;t Diet Plan: 10 Simple Steps to Stay Thin for Life&quot; (William Clower, 2006)
* &quot;French Women Don&#x27;t Get Fat&quot; (Mireille Guiliano, 2004, which became a #1 best-seller in 2006)
* &quot;Cholesterol and The French Paradox&quot; (Frank Cooper, 2009);
* &quot;The French Women Don&#x27;t Get Fat Cookbook&quot; (Mireille Guiliano, 2010).

Other books sought to boost their credibility by reference to the French paradox. The American edition of &quot;The Dukan Diet&quot;, written by Pierre Dukan, a Paris-based doctor, is marketed with the subtitle, &quot;The real reason the French stay thin&quot;.

===Scientific impact===
The existence of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease might not be as strong as had previously been thought. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies that suggested this link.

Some researchers have thrown into question the entire claimed connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. In 2006, this view received some indirect support from the results of the Nurses&#x27; Health Study run by the Women&#x27;s Health Initiative. After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats did not appear to affect heart disease risk, whereas the consumption of trans fat was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Similarly, the authors of a 2009 review of dietary studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease risk.

==Possible explanations==
===Explanations based on the high per capita consumption of red wine in France===
It has been suggested that France&#x27;s high red wine consumption is a primary factor in the trend. This hypothesis was expounded in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; broadcast in 1991. The program catalysed a large increase in North American demand for red wines from around the world. It is believed that one of the components of red wine potentially related to this effect is resveratrol; however, the authors of a 2003 study concluded that the amount of resveratrol absorbed by drinkers of red wine is small enough that it is unlikely to explain the paradox.
===Explanations based on multiple factors===
In &quot;Lifestyle in France and the United States&quot; (2010), one study reviewed identifies three major factors likely to be involved in the paradox:
* Walking (On average, French people walk briskly much more often than Americans.)
* Water (On average, French people drink more water and fewer sweetened drinks than Americans.)
* Fruit and vegetables (On average, French people consume more fresh fruits and vegetables than Americans do.)

In his 2003 book, &quot;The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss&quot;, Will Clower suggests the French paradox may be narrowed down to a few key factors, namely:
* Good fats versus bad fats – French people get up to 80% of their fat intake from dairy and vegetable sources, including whole milk, cheeses, and whole milk yogurt.
* Higher quantities of fish (at least three times a week).
* Smaller portions, eaten more slowly and divided among courses that let the body begin to digest food already consumed before more food is added.
* Lower sugar intake – American low-fat and no-fat foods often contain high concentrations of sugar. French diets avoid these products preferring full-fat versions without added sugar.
* Low incidence of snacks between meals.
* Avoidance of common American food items, such as soda, deep-fried foods, snack foods, and especially prepared foods that can typically make up a large percentage of the foods found in American grocery stores.

Clower tends to downplay the common beliefs that wine consumption and smoking are greatly responsible for the French paradox. While a higher percentage of French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries.

==== Early life nutrition ====
One proposed explanation of the French paradox regards possible effects (epigenetic or otherwise) of dietary improvements in the first months and years of life, exerted across multiple generations. Following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, the French government introduced an aggressive nutritional program providing high quality foods to pregnant women and young children with the aim of fortifying future generations of soldiers (the program was implemented about three decades prior to an analogous initiative in England in response to the Boer War). It has been suggested that the particular timing of this historical intervention might help explain the relatively low rates of obesity and heart disease found in France.

<doc id="319141" wikidata="Q11349" url="?curid=319141" title="Eagle Nebula">
<text>The Eagle Nebula (catalogued as Messier 16 or M16, and as NGC 6611, and also known as the Star Queen Nebula) is a young open cluster of stars in the constellation Serpens, discovered by Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux in 1745–46. Both the &quot;Eagle&quot; and the &quot;Star Queen&quot; refer to visual impressions of the dark silhouette near the center of the nebula, an area made famous as the &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope. The nebula contains several active star-forming gas and dust regions, including the aforementioned Pillars of Creation. The Eagle Nebula lies in the Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way.

==Characteristics==

The Eagle Nebula is part of a diffuse emission nebula, or H II region, which is catalogued as IC 4703. This region of active current star formation is about 5700 light-years distant. A spire of gas that can be seen coming off the nebula in the northeastern part is approximately 9.5 light-years or about 90 trillion kilometers long.

The cluster associated with the nebula has approximately 8100 stars, which are mostly concentrated in a gap in the molecular cloud to the north-west of the Pillars.
The brightest star (HD 168076) has an apparent magnitude of +8.24, easily visible with good binoculars. It is actually a binary star formed of an O3.5V star plus an O7.5V companion. This star has a mass of roughly 80 solar masses, and a luminosity up to 1 million times that of the Sun.
The cluster&#x27;s age has been estimated to be 1–2 million years.

The descriptive names reflect impressions of the shape of the central pillar rising from the southeast into the central luminous area. The name &quot;Star Queen Nebula&quot; was introduced by Robert Burnham, Jr., reflecting his characterization of the central pillar as the Star Queen shown in silhouette.

==&quot;Pillars of Creation&quot; region==
Images produced by Jeff Hester and Paul Scowen using the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 greatly improved scientific understanding of processes inside the nebula. One of these became famous as the &quot;Pillars of Creation&quot;, depicting a large region of star formation. Its small dark pockets are believed to be protostars (Bok globules). The pillar structure resembles that of a much larger instance in the Soul Nebula of Cassiopeia, imaged with the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2005 equally characterized as &quot;Pillars of Star Creation&quot;. or &quot;Pillars of Star Formation&quot;. These columns – which resemble stalagmites protruding from the floor of a cavern – are composed of interstellar hydrogen gas and dust, which act as incubators for new stars. Inside the columns and on their surface astronomers have found knots or globules of denser gas, called EGGs (&quot;Evaporating Gaseous Globules&quot;). Stars are being formed inside some of these.

X-ray images from the Chandra observatory compared with Hubble&#x27;s &quot;Pillars&quot; image have shown that X-ray sources (from young stars) do not coincide with the pillars, but rather randomly dot the nebula. Any protostars in the pillars&#x27; EGGs are not yet hot enough to emit X-rays.

Evidence from the Spitzer Space Telescope originally suggested that the pillars in M16 may be threatened by a &quot;past supernova&quot;. Hot gas observed by Spitzer in 2007 suggested they were already – likely – being disturbed by a supernova that exploded 8,000 to 9,000 years ago. Due to the distance the main blast of light would have reached Earth for a brief time 1,000 to 2,000 years ago. A more slowly moving, theorized, shock wave would have taken a few thousand years to move through the nebula and would have blown away the delicate pillars. However, in 2014 the pillars were imaged a second time by Hubble, in both visible light and infrared light. The images being 20 years later provided a new, detailed account of the rate of evaporation occurring within the pillars. No supernova is evidenced within them, and it is estimated in some form they still exist – and will appear for at least 100,000 more years.

<doc id="319145" wikidata="Q2604921" url="?curid=319145" title="Bahamut Lagoon">
<text>is a 1996 tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; was released on the Virtual Console in Japan on September 29, 2009 for the Wii and on February 5, 2014 for the Wii U.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; is a tactical role-playing game in which players take on the role of Byuu, a soldier of the kingdom of Kahna who leads a campaign against Granbelos Empire across the floating lands of Orelus. The gameplay blends 2D RPG grid-based combat with turn-based combat. Players have the ability to raise and battle dragons to fight alongside a player&#x27;s other characters. A player has a squadron of four characters in combat, and players have six different squadron leaders they can choose from. Each squad leader has a dragon which can be evolved into different types by feeding it weapons, armor, accessories, and items. Feeding dragons foods they like will increase their loyalty, and food they don&#x27;t like will decrease loyalty, but players can still use foods dragons do not like to make a dragon more powerful. Dragons are not controlled by the player, but are given general guidelines such as &quot;Go!&quot; or &quot;Wait!&quot;.

== Plot ==
In the world of Orelus, continents called &quot;lagoons&quot; float in the sky, and war is threatened when the kingdom of Kahna is invaded by the Granbelos Empire. This leads Captain Byuu of the Dragon Squad to fight to repel this invasion, but after the initial victory, Kahna is overrun, and Byuu, the game&#x27;s silent protagonist, leads a continued campaign against the Granbelos Empire.

==Development==
The concept for &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; was created by Hitoshi Sasaki, known for his graphic design work on &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, with him describing it as a game he had wanted to make for a long time. Programmer Hiroshi Ono approached Hironobu Sakaguchi with the proposal of a team of new Square developers creating their own project. Beginning development around the concept of a traditional RPG with random encounters, it shifted to its current tactical design. Sakaguchi, who was a fan of the tactical RPG genre, approved the project; it was originally titled &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;. Production began in 1994 at Square&#x27;s Development Department 6 and lasted for two years. Sasaki acted as lead designer and lead artist. The game was directed by Kazushige Nojima, who joined the company in 1994 from Data East after working as writer for the &quot;Glory of Heracles&quot; series. The producer was Tadashi Nomura. The scenario was written by Motomu Toriyama, who also joined in 1994 and took up the role as no-one had.

The game&#x27;s setting was inspired by Sasaki&#x27;s memory of flying over the Izu Peninsula, wanting to evoke a similar feeling of a &quot;floating lagoon&quot;. The scenario, which featured complex relationships and betrayals, was directly influenced by events in Toriyama&#x27;s life. Toriyama attributed his leading role in the scenario to the team&#x27;s nature as a group of newcomers. The battle system was designed by Takatsuga Nakazawa, who wanted to make the game challenging yet balanced for players, with Sasaki calling Nakazawa &quot;brutal&quot; with some of his trap placements. Dragon breeding was implemented during the later half of development, which influenced its design transition into a tactical RPG. Ono wanted the dragons to exist as their own creatures outside player control, hence being driven by the game&#x27;s AI. An abandoned idea was dragons fighting and eating each other during battles. Sasaki also wanted the dragons not to act like party members, comparing them to pets that acted on their own. Space limitations forced a reduction in the planned character behaviour pattern.

===Music===
The music was composed and arranged by Noriko Matsueda. Teruaki Sugawara acted as sound engineer, and the sound programmer was Hidenori Suzuki. &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; was Matsueda&#x27;s second major video game, having first co-composed the score of &quot;Front Mission&quot; with Yoko Shimomura. Matsueda wanted to create a score close to orchestral music, working within the platform&#x27;s limited sound environment to create that impression through &quot;reverb, spatiality, and balance&quot;. She also wanted music that would get players emotionally invested in the narrative, thinking of that before matching songs to in-game areas. An official soundtrack album was published by NTT Publishing on February 25, 1996.

== Release ==
&quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; was released for the Super Famicom on February 9, 1996. It was one of Square&#x27;s last Super Famicom releases before they broke with Nintendo to develop for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation. As with other of Square&#x27;s Super Famicom titles of the time, copies were priced high due to the growing expense of cartridge production. It was re-released in the Japanese Virtual Console for Wii on September 29, 2009, and for Wii U on February 5, 2014. The Wii version was taken down with the console&#x27;s Virtual Console store in 2019.

The game has never been officially released outside Japan. A fan translation patch was created by a three-person team including Clyde Mandelin and released in 2002, noted as sharing many issues of translations of that era. A second notably-polished fan translation was created by Near, known for their work on Super Famicom emulators who had been working on and off on the project for over twenty years. The translation was released in 2021. The updated &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; translation was the last project completed by Near before their death by suicide in June of that year following an online harassment campaign.

== Reception ==

During 1996, &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; sold over 474,600 copies, making it the 17th best-selling game of the year and Square&#x27;s third best-selling title after &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; and &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a score of 29 points out of 40. &quot;VideoGames&quot;, as part of a feature on upcoming RPGs, described the game as looking &quot;phenomenal&quot;, highlighting its graphics and gameplay design.

The narrative saw mixed reactions. &quot;Edge&quot; praised the narrative as moving away from its initial premise, and lauding the cast as a blending of strengths between &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. French website &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; noted that the storyline evolved beyond its opening tropes due to how the characters acted and the plot secrets revealed during the last chapters. &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Seán Michael Peters noted the use of multiple overused genre tropes, but also praised the story twists and character evolution. Nick Rox of &quot;GameFan&quot; did not mention the story, but was dismissive of the premise.

The graphics and music were generally praised. &quot;Edge&quot; described the graphics and sprite work as some of the best on the system. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; gave praise to the graphics and highlighted the constant use of filters and effects, but faulted a lack of variety in the soundtrack. Peters praised the graphics despite not matching other Super Famicom titles such as &quot;Star Ocean&quot;, and generally enjoyed the music despite some repetition. Rox called the visuals and effects &quot;excellent&quot; despite finding them lacking compared to some earlier Square titles on the platform and positively noting the added character movement graphics, additionally praising Matsueda&#x27;s score.

The gameplay also met with praise from Western reviewers. Speaking about the gameplay, &quot;Edge&quot; lauded the amount of customization options given to the player and the depth of combat, comparing it favorably to later RPGs. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; positively noted the gameplay depth and gave extensive commentary and praise to the dragon raising and commanding mechanics. Peters enjoyed the gameplay mechanics, but described the difficulty as unexpectedly high. Rox was mixed on the gameplay, finding it too easy, inferior to that of &quot;Front Mission&quot; and referring to the title as &quot;basically &quot;Shining Force&quot; with dragons&quot;.

Retrospective opinions on &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; have been positive. Alex Kwan of &quot;Game On USA&quot; praised its mechanics as innovative within the genre, but considered its difficulty to be fairly low. Kurt Kalata, writing for &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot; positively noted the story&#x27;s focus on clashing personalities and its depth of tactical mechanics. Reviewing the Wii U Virtual Console release, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Kerry Brunskill noted that it stood out from other tactical RPGs due to its blend of gameplay elements and dragon raising mechanics. Rolando Orcha of &quot;Siliconera&quot; praised its blending of tactical and standard RPG elements, hoping for its eventual appearance on other platforms and a localized release. As part of an interview with Sakaguchi, Simon Parkin of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot; as one of several &quot;fascinating curios&quot; produced by Square during the early to mid 1990s. In an article on six Super Famicom imports, &quot;1Up.com&quot;″s Bob Mackey called it a &quot;fantastic game&quot; and a notable title from Square&#x27;s final year with Nintendo.

<text>The United Nations has authorized 71 peacekeeping operations as of April 2018. These do not include interventions authorized by the UN like the Korean War and the Gulf War. The 1990s saw the most UN peacekeeping operations to date. Peacekeeping operations are overseen by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and share some common characteristics, namely the inclusion of a military or police component, often with an authorization for use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Peacekeeping operations are distinct from special political missions (SPMs), which are overseen by the Department of Political Affairs (DPA). SPMs are not included in the table below.

<doc id="319149" wikidata="Q4859409" url="?curid=319149" title="Burning of Parliament">
<text>The Palace of Westminster, the medieval royal palace used as the home of the British parliament, was largely destroyed by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of carelessly in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords&#x27; chamber and up through the walls.

The resulting fire spread rapidly throughout the complex and developed into the largest conflagration in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War; the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for most of the night and destroyed a large part of the palace, including the converted St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel—the meeting place of the House of Commons—the Lords Chamber, the Painted Chamber and the official residences of the Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Commons.

The actions of Superintendent James Braidwood of the London Fire Engine Establishment ensured that Westminster Hall and a few other parts of the old Houses of Parliament survived the blaze. In 1836 a competition for designs for a new palace was won by Charles Barry. Barry&#x27;s plans, developed in collaboration with Augustus Pugin, incorporated the surviving buildings into the new complex. The competition established Gothic Revival as the predominant national architectural style and the palace has since been categorised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site of outstanding universal value.

==Background==

The Palace of Westminster originally dates from the early eleventh century when Canute the Great built his royal residence on the north side of the River Thames. Successive kings added to the complex: Edward the Confessor built Westminster Abbey; William the Conqueror began building a new palace; his son, William Rufus, continued the process, which included Westminster Hall, started in 1097; Henry III built new buildings for the Exchequer—the taxation and revenue gathering department of the country—in 1270 and the Court of Common Pleas, along with the Court of King&#x27;s Bench and Court of Chancery. By 1245 the King&#x27;s throne was present in the palace, which signified that the building was at the centre of English royal administration.

In 1295 Westminster was the venue for the Model Parliament, the first English representative assembly, summoned by Edward I; during his reign he called sixteen parliaments, which sat either in the Painted Chamber or the White Chamber. By 1332 the barons (representing the titled classes) and burgesses and citizens (representing the commons) began to meet separately, and by 1377 the two bodies were entirely detached. In 1512 a fire destroyed part of the royal palace complex and Henry VIII moved the royal residence to the nearby Palace of Whitehall, although Westminster still retained its status as a royal palace. In 1547 Henry&#x27;s son, Edward VI, provided St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel for the Commons to use as their debating chamber. The House of Lords met in the medieval hall of the Queen&#x27;s Chamber, before moving to the Lesser Hall in 1801. Over the three centuries from 1547 the palace was enlarged and altered, becoming a warren of wooden passages and stairways.

St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel remained largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, at the time the Master of the King&#x27;s Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as &quot;dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small ... when an important debate occurred ... the members were really to be pitied&quot;. When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted &quot;What I may term corporeal conveniences were ... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands.&quot; The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked &quot;Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone ... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than a foot and a half square?&quot;

By 1834 the palace complex had been further developed, firstly by John Vardy in the middle of the eighteenth century, and in the early nineteenth century by James Wyatt and Sir John Soane. Vardy added the Stone Building, in a Palladian style to the West side of Westminster Hall; Wyatt enlarged the Commons, moved the Lords into the Court of Requests and rebuilt the Speaker&#x27;s House. Soane, taking on responsibility for the palace complex on Wyatt&#x27;s death in 1813, undertook rebuilding of Westminster Hall and constructed the Law Courts in a Neoclassical style. Soane also provided a new royal entrance, staircase and gallery, as well as committee rooms and libraries.

The potential dangers of the building were apparent to some, as no fire stops or party walls were present in the building to slow the progress of a fire. In the late eighteenth century a committee of MPs predicted that there would be a disaster if the palace caught fire. This was followed by a 1789 report from fourteen architects warning against the possibility of fire in the palace; signatories included Soane and Robert Adam. Soane again warned of the dangers in 1828, when he wrote that &quot;the want of security from fire, the narrow, gloomy and unhealthy passages, and the insufficiency of the accommodations in this building are important objections which call loudly for revision and speedy amendment.&quot; His report was again ignored.
Since medieval times the Exchequer had used tally sticks, pieces of carved, notched wood, normally willow, as part of their accounting procedures. The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as &quot;roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb&quot;. These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By the end of the eighteenth century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an &quot;obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom&quot;; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that &quot;all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception.&quot; By the time the replacement process had finished, there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.

In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, received instructions from Treasury officials to clear the old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers&#x27; chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up the walls of the basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords&#x27; chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.

==16 October 1834==
The process of destroying the tally sticks began at dawn on 16 October and continued throughout the day; two Irish labourers, Joshua Cross and Patrick Furlong, were assigned the task. Weobley checked in on the men throughout the day, claiming subsequently that, on his visits, both furnace doors were open, which allowed the two labourers to watch the flames, while the piles of sticks in both furnaces were only ever high. Another witness to the events, Richard Reynolds, the firelighter in the Lords, later reported that he had seen Cross and Furlong throwing handfuls of tallies onto the fire—an accusation they both denied.

Those tending the furnaces were unaware that the heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven farther up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.

A strong smell of burning was present in the Lords&#x27; chambers during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00 pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod&#x27;s box in the corner of the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00 pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.

Shortly after 5:00 pm, heat and sparks from a flue ignited the woodwork above. The first flames were spotted at 6:00 pm, under the door of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod&#x27;s box alight, and flames burning the curtains and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, at the other end of the palace complex.

At 6:30 pm there was a flashover, a giant ball of flame that &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; reported &quot;burst forth in the centre of the House of Lords, ... and burnt with such fury that in less than half an hour, the whole interior ... presented ... one entire mass of fire.&quot; The explosion, and the resultant burning roof, lit up the skyline, and could be seen by the royal family in Windsor Castle, away. Alerted by the flames, help arrived from nearby parish fire engines; as there were only two hand-pump engines on the scene, they were of limited use. They were joined at 6:45 pm by 100 soldiers from the Grenadier Guards, some of whom helped the police in forming a large square in front of the palace to keep the growing crowd back from the firefighters; some of the soldiers assisted the firemen in pumping the water supply from the engines.

The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an organisation run by several insurance companies in the absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00 pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.

By the time Braidwood and his men had arrived on the scene, the House of Lords had been destroyed. A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow corridors into St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel. Shortly after his arrival the roof of the chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was so loud that the watching crowds thought there had been a Gunpowder Plot-style explosion. According to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;By half-past seven o&#x27;clock the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect.&quot; Braidwood saw it was too late to save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected the hall to the already burning Speaker&#x27;s House, and then soak the hall&#x27;s roof to prevent it catching fire. In doing so he saved the medieval structure at the expense of those parts of the complex already ablaze.

The glow from the burning, and the news spreading quickly round London, ensured that crowds continued to turn up in increasing numbers to watch the spectacle. Among them was a reporter for &quot;The Times&quot;, who noticed that there were &quot;vast gangs of the light-fingered gentry in attendance, who doubtless reaped a rich harvest, and [who] did not fail to commit several desperate outrages&quot;. The crowds were so thick that they blocked Westminster Bridge in their attempts to get a good view, and many took to the river in whatever craft they could find or hire in order to watch better. A crowd of thousands congregated in Parliament Square to witness the spectacle, including the Prime Minister—Lord Melbourne—and many of his cabinet. Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish philosopher, was one of those present that night, and he later recalled that:


This view was doubted by Sir John Hobhouse, the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, who oversaw the upkeep of royal buildings, including the Palace of Westminster. He wrote that &quot;the crowd behaved very well; only one man was taken up for huzzaing when the flames increased. ... on the whole, it was impossible for any large assemblage of people to behave better.&quot; Many of the MPs and peers present, including Lord Palmerston, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, helped break down doors to rescue books and other treasures, aided by passers-by; the Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms had to break into a burning room to save the parliamentary mace.

At 9:00 pm three Guards regiments arrived on the scene. Although the troops assisted in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.

At around 1:30 am the tide had risen enough to allow the LFEE&#x27;s floating fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker&#x27;s House.

Braidwood regarded Westminster Hall as safe from destruction by 1:45 am, partly because of the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change in the direction of the wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00 am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00 am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.

The House of Lords, as well as its robing and committee rooms, were all destroyed, as was the Painted Chamber, and the connecting end of the Royal Gallery. The House of Commons, along with its library and committee rooms, the official residence of the Clerk of the House and the Speaker&#x27;s House, were devastated. Other buildings, such as the Law Courts, were badly damaged. The buildings within the complex which emerged relatively unscathed included Westminster Hall, the cloisters and undercroft of St Stephen&#x27;s, the Jewel Tower and Soane&#x27;s new buildings to the south. The British standard measurements, the yard and pound, were both lost in the blaze; the measurements had been created in 1496. Also lost were most of the procedural records for the House of Commons, which dated back as far as the late 15th century. The original Acts of Parliament from 1497 survived, as did the Lords&#x27; Journals, all of which were stored in the Jewel Tower at the time of the fire. In the words of Shenton, the fire was &quot;the most momentous blaze in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz&quot; of the Second World War. Despite the size and ferocity of the fire, there were no deaths, although there were nine casualties during the night&#x27;s events that were serious enough to require hospitalisation.

==Aftermath==

The day after the fire the Office of Woods and Forests issued a report outlining the damage, stating that &quot;the strictest enquiry is in progress as to the cause of this calamity, but there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it has arisen from any other than accidental causes.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; reported on some of the possible causes of the fire, but indicated that it was likely that the burning of the Exchequer tallies was to blame. The same day the cabinet ministers who were in London met for an emergency cabinet meeting; they ordered a list of witnesses to be drawn up, and on 22 October a committee of the Privy Council sat to investigate the fire.

The committee, which met in private, heard numerous theories as to the causes of the fire, including the lax attitude of plumbers working in the Lords, carelessness of the servants at Howard&#x27;s Coffee House—situated inside the palace—and a gas explosion. Other rumours began to circulate; the Prime Minister received an anonymous letter claiming that the fire was an arson attack. The committee issued its report on 8 November, which identified the burning of the tallies as the cause of the fire. The committee thought it unlikely that Cross and Furlong had been as careful in filling the furnaces as they had claimed, and the report stated that &quot;it is unfortunate that Mr Weobley did not more effectively superintend the burning of the tallies&quot;.
King William IV offered Buckingham Palace as a replacement to parliament; the proposal was declined by MPs who considered the building &quot;dingy&quot;. Parliament still needed somewhere to meet, and the Lesser Hall and Painted Chamber were re-roofed and furnished for the Commons and Lords respectively for the State Opening of Parliament on 23 February 1835.

Although the architect Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 to design a replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity in the press and led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission, which decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen&#x27;s would all be incorporated into the new complex.

There were 97 entries to the competition, which closed in November 1835; each entry was to be identifiable only by a pseudonym or symbol. The commission presented their recommendation in February 1836; the winning entry, which brought a prize of £1,500, was number 64, identified by a portcullis—the symbol chosen by the architect Charles Barry. Uninspired by any English secular Elizabethan or Gothic buildings, Barry had visited Belgium to view examples of Flemish civic architecture before he drafted his design; to complete the necessary pen and ink drawings, which are now lost, he employed Augustus Pugin, a 23-year-old architect who was, in the words of the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner, &quot;the most fertile and passionate of the Gothicists&quot;. Thirty-four of the competitors petitioned parliament against the selection of Barry, who was a friend of Cust, but their plea was rejected, and the former prime minister Sir Robert Peel defended Barry and the selection process.

==New Palace of Westminster==

Barry planned an enfilade, or what Christopher Jones, the former BBC political editor, has called &quot;one long spine of Lords&#x27; and Commons&#x27; Chambers&quot; which enabled the Speaker of the House of Commons to look through the line of the building to see the Queen&#x27;s throne in the House of Lords. Laid out around 11 courtyards, the building included several residences with accommodation for about 200 people, and comprised a total of 1,180 rooms, 126 staircases and of corridors. Between 1836 and 1837 Pugin made more detailed drawings on which estimates were made for the palace&#x27;s completion; reports of the cost estimates vary from £707,000 to £725,000, with six years until completion of the project.

In June 1838 Barry and colleagues undertook a tour of Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry&#x27;s wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London it proved to be problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.

Although there was a setback in progress with a stonemasons&#x27; strike between September 1841 and May 1843, the House of Lords had its first sitting in the new chamber in 1847. In 1852 the Commons was finished, and both Houses sat in their new chambers for the first time; Queen Victoria first used the newly completed royal entrance. In the same year, while Barry was appointed a Knight Bachelor, Pugin suffered a mental breakdown and, following incarceration at Bethlehem Pauper Hospital for the Insane, died at the age of 40.

The clock tower was completed in 1858, and the Victoria Tower in 1860; Barry died in May that year, before the building work was completed. The final stages of the work were overseen by his son, Edward, who continued working on the building until 1870. The total cost of the building came to around £2.5 million.

==Legacy==
In 1836 the Royal Commission on Public Records was formed to look into the loss of the parliamentary records, and make recommendations on the preservation of future archives. Their published recommendations in 1837 led to the Public Record Act (1838), which set up the Public Record Office, initially based in Chancery Lane.
The fire became the &quot;single most depicted event in nineteenth-century London ... attracting to the scene a host of engravers, watercolourists and painters&quot;. Among them were J. M. W. Turner, the landscape painter, who later produced two pictures of the fire, and the Romantic painter John Constable, who sketched the fire from a hansom cab on Westminster Bridge.

The destruction of the standard measurements led to an overhaul of the British weights and measures system. An inquiry that ran from 1838 to 1841 considered the two competing systems used in the country, the avoirdupois and troy measures, and decided that avoirdupois would be used forthwith; troy weights were retained solely for gold, silver and precious stones. The destroyed weights and measures were recast by William Simms, the scientific instrument maker, who produced the replacements after &quot;countless hours of tests and experiments to determine the best metal, the best shape of bar, and the corrections for temperature&quot;.

The Palace of Westminster has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987, and is classified as being of outstanding universal value. UNESCO describe the site as being &quot;of great historic and symbolic significance&quot;, in part because it is &quot;one of the most significant monuments of neo-Gothic architecture, as an outstanding, coherent and complete example of neo-Gothic style&quot;. The decision to use the Gothic design for the palace set the national style, even for secular buildings.

In 2015 the chairman of the House of Commons Commission, John Thurso, stated that the palace was in a &quot;dire condition&quot;. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, agreed and said that the building was in need of extensive repairs. He reported that parliament &quot;suffers from flooding, contains a great deal of asbestos and has fire safety issues&quot;, which would cost £3 billion to fix.

<text>Messier 4 or M4 (also known as NGC 6121 or the Spider Globular Cluster) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Scorpius. It was discovered by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745 and catalogued by Charles Messier in 1764. It was the first globular cluster in which individual stars were resolved.

==Visibility==
M4 is conspicuous in even the smallest of telescopes as a fuzzy ball of light. It appears about the same size as the Moon in the sky. It is one of the easiest globular clusters to find, being located only 1.3 degrees west of the bright star Antares, with both objects being visible in a wide-field telescope. Modestly sized telescopes will begin to resolve individual stars, of which the brightest in M4 are of apparent magnitude 10.8.

==Characteristics==
M4 is a rather loosely concentrated cluster of class IX and measures 75 light-years across. It features a characteristic &quot;bar&quot; structure across its core, visible to moderate sized telescopes. The structure consists of 11th-magnitude stars and is approximately 2.5&#x27; long and was first noted by William Herschel in 1783. At least 43 variable stars have been observed within M4.

M4 is approximately 6,000 light-years away, making it the closest globular cluster to the Solar System. It has an estimated age of 12.2 billion years.

In astronomy, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is called the metallicity, and it is usually denoted by the abundance ratio of iron to hydrogen as compared to the Sun. For this cluster, the measured abundance of iron is equal to:
:formula_1
This value is the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen relative to the same ratio in the Sun. Thus the cluster has an abundance of iron equal to 8.5% of the iron abundance in the Sun. This strongly suggests this cluster hosts two distinct stellar populations, differing by age. Thus the cluster probably saw two main cycles or phases of star formation.

The space velocity components are (U, V, W) = (, , ) km/s. This confirms an orbit around the Milky Way of a period of with eccentricity 0.80 ± 0.03: during periapsis it comes within from the galactic core, while at apoapsis it travels out to . The inclination is at (an angle of) from the galactic plane, thus it reaches as much as above the disk. When passing through the disk, this cluster does so at less than 5 kpc from the galactic nucleus. The cluster undergoes tidal shock during each passage, which can cause the repeated shedding of stars. Thus the cluster may have been much more massive.

==Notable stars==
Photographs by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 found white dwarf stars in M4 that are among the oldest known stars in our galaxy; aged 13 billion years. One has been found to be a binary star with a pulsar companion, PSR B1620−26 and a planet orbiting it with a mass of 2.5 times that of Jupiter (). One star in Messier 4 was also found to have much more of the rare light element lithium than expected.

CX-1 Is located in M4. It is known as a possible millisecond pulsar/neutron star binary. It orbits in 6.31 hours.

==Spinthariscope analogy==
The view of Messier 4 through a good telescope was likened by Robert Burnham Jr. to that of hyperkinetic luminous alpha particles seen in a spinthariscope.

==Central black hole==

In 2023, an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope and European Space Agency&#x27;s Gaia spacecraft data from Messier 4 revealed an excess mass of roughly 800 solar masses in the center of this cluster, which appears to not be extended. This could thus be considered as kinematic evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole (even if an unusually compact cluster of compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes cannot be completely discounted).

<doc id="319152" wikidata="Q416171" url="?curid=319152" title="Akashic records">
<text>In the religion of Theosophy and the spiritual movement called Anthroposophy, the Akashic records are believed by Theosophists to be a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future in terms of all entities and life forms, not just human. They are believed by theosophists to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the mental plane. There is no evidence for the existence of Akashic records, and rigorous scientific research in this field has seen little traction.

&quot;Akasha&quot; (&quot;&quot; ) is the Sanskrit word for &quot;aether&quot;, &quot;sky&quot;, or &quot;atmosphere&quot;.

==History==
===Theosophical Society===
The Sanskrit term &quot;akasha&quot; was introduced to the language of theosophy through Helena Blavatsky (1831–1891), who characterized it as a sort of life force; she also referred to &quot;indestructible tablets of the astral light&quot; recording both the past and future of human thought and action, but she did not use the term &quot;akashic&quot;. The notion of an akashic &quot;record&quot; was further disseminated by Alfred Percy Sinnett in his book &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; (1883) when he cites Henry Steel Olcott&#x27;s &quot;A Buddhist Catechism&quot; (1881). Olcott wrote that &quot;Buddha taught two things are eternal, viz, &#x27;Akasa&#x27; and &#x27;Nirvana&#x27;: everything has come out of Akasa in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it, and, passes away. No thing ever comes out of nothing.&quot;

By C. W. Leadbeater&#x27;s &quot;Clairvoyance&quot; (1899) the association of the term with the idea was complete, and he identified the akashic records by name as something a clairvoyant could read. 
In his 1913 &quot;&quot;, Leadbeater claims to record the history of Atlantis and other civilizations as well as the future society of Earth in the 28th century.

Alice A. Bailey wrote in her book &quot;The Light of the Soul&quot; on &quot;The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Book 3 – Union Achieved and Its Results&quot; (1927):

===Rudolf Steiner===
The Austrian theosophist, and later founder of Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner used the Akashic records concept mainly in a series of articles in his journal &quot;Lucifer-Gnosis&quot; from 1904 to 1908, where he wrote about Atlantis and Lemuria, topics related to their purported history and civilization. Besides this, he used the term in the title of lectures on a &quot;Fifth Gospel&quot; held in 1913 and 1914, shortly after the foundation of the Anthroposophical Society and Steiner&#x27;s exclusion from the Theosophical Society Adyar.

===Other===
Edgar Cayce claimed to be able to access the Akashic records. Musician Prince used references to akashic records as a storytelling device throughout his album &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;, particularly in reference to the history of slavery in the United States. The character Obadiah Archer from the Valiant Comics universe series &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot; is able to access the Akashic plane to mimic all known human and superhuman abilities since the 2012 reboot.

<text>Messier 83 or M83, also known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy and NGC 5236, is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 15 million light-years away in the constellation borders of Hydra and Centaurus. Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered M83 on 17 February 1752 at the Cape of Good Hope. Charles Messier added it to his catalogue of nebulous objects (now known as the Messier Catalogue) in March 1781.

It is one of the closest and brightest barred spiral galaxies in the sky, and is visible with binoculars. It has an isophotal diameter at about . Its nickname of the Southern Pinwheel derives from its resemblance to the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101).

== Characteristics ==

M83 is a massive, grand design spiral galaxy. Its morphological classification in the De Vaucouleurs system is SAB(s)c, where the &#x27;SAB&#x27; denotes a weak-barred spiral, &#x27;(s)&#x27; indicates a pure spiral structure with no ring, and &#x27;c&#x27; means the spiral arms are loosely wound. The peculiar dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 lies near M83, and the two likely interacted within the last billion years resulting in starburst activity in their central regions.

The star formation rate in M83 is higher along the leading edge of the spiral arms, as predicted by density wave theory. NASA&#x27;s Galaxy Evolution Explorer project on 16 April 2008 reported finding large numbers of new stars in the outer reaches of the galaxy— from the center. It had been thought that these areas lacked the materials necessary for star formation.

== Supernovae ==
Six supernovae have been observed in M83:
* SN 1923A (type unknown, mag. 14) was discovered by Carl Otto Lampland on 5 May 1923.
* SN 1945B (type unknown, mag. 14.2) was discovered by William Liller on 13 July 1945.
* SN 1950B (type unknown, mag. 14.5) was discovered by Guillermo Haro on 15 March 1950.
* SN 1957D (type unknown, mag. 15) was discovered by H. S. Gates on 28 December 1957.
* SN 1968L (type II-P, mag. 11.9) was discovered by J. C. Bennett on 17 July 1968.
* SN 1983N (type Ia, mag. 11.9) was discovered by Robert Evans from Australia on July 3, 1983. On July 6, it was observed with the Very Large Array and became the first type I supernova to have a radio emission detected. The supernova reached peak optical brightness on July 17, achieving an apparent visual magnitude of 11.54. Although identified as type I, the spectrum was considered peculiar. A year after the explosion, about of iron was discovered in the ejecta. This was the first time that such a large amount of iron was unambiguously detected from a supernova explosion. SN 1983N became the modern prototype of a hydrogen deficient type Ib supernova, with the progenitor being inferred as a Wolf–Rayet star.

M83 is at the center of one of two subgroups within the Centaurus A/M83 Group, a nearby galaxy group. Centaurus A is at the center of the other subgroup. These are sometimes identified as one group, and sometimes as two. However, the galaxies around Centaurus A and the galaxies around M83 are physically close to each other, and both subgroups appear not to be moving relative to each other.

<doc id="319156" wikidata="Q15224083" url="?curid=319156" title="Hillsborough (ward)">
<text>Hillsborough is an electoral ward which includes the districts of Malin Bridge, Owlerton, Wadsley and Wisewood. It is one of the 28 electoral wards in City of Sheffield, England. It is located in the northwestern part of the city and covers an area of 4.6 km2. The population of this ward in 2011 was 18,605 people in 8,012 households.

==Governance==
Since the 2010 general election Hillsborough ward is in Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough UK parliamentary constituency. Prior to this it was covered by Sheffield Hillsborough. Since the 2015 local government boundary review, Hillsborough ward also partially lies within the boundaries of Sheffield Central constituency.

==Districts of Hillsborough ward==
===Hillsborough===

Hillsborough () is a suburb in northwest Sheffield. It lies at the point where the River Loxley and the River Rivelin flow into the River Don.

Hillsborough lies on the Sheffield Supertram route, and is home to a number of industries. Liquorice Allsorts are manufactured by Bassetts in Hillsborough. The district is also a shopping area, centred on Hillsborough Corner.

Landmarks in the district include the Hillsborough Barracks, Hillsborough House and Hillsborough Arena in Hillsborough Park and the Regent Court flats.

Opened in 1994, Sheffield Supertram&#x27;s northern terminuses (Malin Bridge and Middlewood) are in or near Hillsborough, and in the centre of Hillsborough lies the Hillsborough Interchange which is a local hub for buses and trams near Hillsborough Barracks. High Frequency Buses to/via City Centre – First South Yorkshire – 18, 52a, 81, 82, 97, 98 and 135 Stagecoach Sheffield – 52 (evenings only) and M92 . Powells 61, 62.

Hillsborough is a large suburb, and because of its prominence (particularly its large shopping area), and the presence of &quot;Hillsborough&quot; stadium in Owlerton, even local people tend to extend its boundaries beyond the strict definitions usually counting Owlerton as part of Hillsborough, and often Malin Bridge, Wadsley and Middlewood too.

===Wadsley===

Wadsley () is a village—now a district of Sheffield—that dates from Saxon times. Its name comes from the Old English &quot;Wadde&#x27;s Leah&quot;, which means &#x27;Wadde&#x27;s forest clearing&#x27;. Wadsley hall is the former residence of the lords of this manor. It was much altered in 1722 by George Bamforth, and it was the birthplace of Sir John Fowler (15 July 1817 – 20 November 1898) designer of the Forth Rail Bridge. It has its own parish church. It is not the same district as Wadsley Bridge, which is near Owlerton.

===Wisewood===

Wisewood is the area at the top of the hill between the Rivers Don and Loxley. It is mostly the Sutton Estate built by the William Sutton Housing Trust, and the Wisewood Estate. The Wisewood Estate was known locally as the Button Estate (in contrast to Sutton). When originally built in the 1930s many of the occupants worked in uniformed occupations, such as policemen and tram conductors, and the uniforms were noted for their buttons.

===Malin Bridge===

Malin Bridge () is in the northwest of Sheffield at the confluence of the rivers Loxley and Rivelin, just above the confluence with the River Don at Owlerton.

Malin Bridge was devastated by the Great Sheffield flood, which happened in 1864 when the Dale Dyke Dam collapsed while it was filling for the first time. The flood swept down the River Loxley, past Malin Bridge and Hillsborough corner, into the River Don and on into Sheffield and on to Rotherham. In the space of around twenty minutes, nearly 100 people lost their lives as the floodwaters and its payload swept much of the buildings and their occupants away.

===Owlerton===

Owlerton () is a former hamlet now a district of Sheffield to the east of Hillsborough. The name derives from &quot;Alor-tun&quot;, which means a &#x27;farmstead of the alders&#x27;. In the 18th century people came here in great numbers to take water from a &quot;holy well&quot; that had been discovered here. Owlerton Stadium is used for greyhound racing and speedway. Owlerton is also the location of the Hillsborough Stadium (not actually in Hillsborough on the strictest definition) where Sheffield Wednesday play their matches, and is the source of the team&#x27;s nickname (the Owls), even though Owlerton is not pronounced to rhyme with Owl. Hillsborough Stadium was the site of the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster.

===Neepsend===

Part of the industrial suburb of Neepsend which lies on the eastern side of the River Don is in the Hillsborough electoral ward, having previously been in the Walkley ward before boundary adjustments in 2016.

<doc id="319158" wikidata="Q7231596" url="?curid=319158" title="Porter Brook">
<text>The Porter Brook is a river which flows through the City of Sheffield, England, descending over from its source on Burbage Moor to the west of the city to its mouth where it joins the River Sheaf in a culvert beneath Sheffield railway station. Like the other rivers in Sheffield, its steep gradient made it ideal for powering water mills and works associated with the metalworking and cutlery industries, and around 20 dams were constructed over the centuries to facilitate this. At its lower end, it is extensively culverted, but parts of it are gradually being restored to open channels, as part of a daylighting scheme for the city.

The brook derives its name from its brownish colour, similar to the colour of Porter beer.

==Route==
===Source===
The Porter Brook rises from a series of springs among the sedge grass of Burbage Moor, the highest of which is close to the contour near Brown Edge Farm. Its source is just inside the Peak District National Park, to the north-west of the village of Ringinglow. It passes through Clough Hollow, and under Fulwood Lane, where it leaves the National Park. Nearby, at the junction of Fulwood Lane and Greenhouse Lane is a Rotary Club funded toposcope, Finder Cairn, a rotary orientation table which indicates the direction of local landmarks.

===Porter Valley===
Beyond Fulwood Lane the brook flows into the Porter valley. The valley is divided into a series of five green and open spaces, created along the river valley between 1885 and 1938 and collectively known as the Porter Valley Parks.

Just before it reaches the bridge carrying Woodcliffe over it, the river is joined by Mayfield Brook, which rises at a similar level but a little further to the north. Before the junction, Mayfield Brook supplied power to Fulwood corn mill, the highest mill on the system. Soon the combined flow reaches Forge Dam, now a large lake with an island. In Sheffield, &quot;dam&quot; referred to the body of water, rather than the structure which impounded it. Mills used for grinding were known as wheels, and the tail race was known as a goit.

Beyond Forge Dam, where the Porter is defined as a main river, the brook passes Wire Mill Dam, where there is a monument celebrating the life of Thomas Boulsover, the inventor of Sheffield Plate. The grade II listed structure was constructed in 1927 by a Master Cutler called David Flather, and may have been built from materials taken from the Wire Mill. Below Whiteley Wood Road bridge it is joined by a small tributary, flowing northwards from springs in the Porter Valley Woodlands Local Nature Reserve (LNR). Next it reaches Hangingwater Road bridge, a massive structure built around 1800, with two small segmental arches. Immediately below the bridge is the dam for Shepherd Wheel, with the buildings at its downstream end. The dam, goit, buildings and weir are grade II* listed, as internally, the machinery is complete and still operational. The site is run as a museum.
The river continues through Whiteley Woods, passing Ibbotson dam before crossing under Oakbrook Road and back again to reach Nether Spurgear dam. Oak Brook flows southwards from the grounds of Tapton Hall to join the north bank, and Holme dam is close to the river as it enters Endcliffe Wood. of land in Endcliffe Woods, at the eastern end of the linear park, was bought by Sheffield Corporation in 1885, to create public walks and pleasure grounds, but they also had another motive. The river at the time was a serious health risk, as sewage from newly built houses to the north of the river was flowing into the channel. Once they owned the woods, they were able to build a sewer through it. They then asked William Goldring to create a public park in the woods, which included gravelled paths, flower beds, ornamental shrubberies, rustic bridges, seating and a refreshment room. Several dams were repurposed, with Endcliffe dam used for bathing, Holme dam for skating, and Nether Spurgear dam for wildfowl.

In 1924, Sheffield&#x27;s commitment to public spaces was recognised by Patrick Abercrombie in his Civic Survey, where he described the Porter Valley parks as &quot;the finest example to be found in this country of a radial park strip, an elongated open space, leading from a built-up part of the city direct into the country.&quot;

===Inner city===
At the eastern end of Endcliffe Park the river is crossed by the B6069 Brocco Bank road, close to the roundabout on Ecclesall Road, now the A625. Ecclesall Road became a toll road in 1810, and the toll gate is situated in the centre of the roundabout, although it is not in its original location, as it was moved in the early 20th century. Beyond Brocco Bank is a small bridge built in 1899 to serve the George Woofindin almshouses, arranged in a crescent on the north side of the river. The river then enters a section of culvert, to emerge on the south side of Ecclesall Road, and weaves its way between housing to reach Sharrow Vale dam and snuff mill. The main building, dating from 1737 onwards, straddles the river, with a newer building dating from 1880 to the north, containing the original machinery which was still in use in 2004. At the eastern end of the buildings is a bridge dating from the late 18th century.
The river then runs parallel to Ecclesall Road along the north-western edge of Sheffield General Cemetery. The main gateway, built in Greek Revival style by the Sheffield architect Samuel Worth in 1836, incorporates a lodge on either side, and the whole structure is built on an elongated bridge across the river. After passing under Pear Street and Summerfield Street, it enters a site which was Ward&#x27;s Brewery until it closed in 1999. It has been redeveloped as housing, although the original entrance arch has been retained. The river then enters the Waitrose culvert, which carries it under Harrow Street and a Waitrose supermarket. It appears again near the former Sheffield Union Banking Co building, which in 2021 was the Baan Thai Restaurant, before the St Marys Gate culvert takes it under London Road and the A61 St Mary&#x27;s Gate. There is a short exposed section by the Theatre Deli car park and the Eyre Street culvert then passes under Eyre Street and the Decathlon sports shop, before the river re-emerges on the north side of Mary Street. It flows under Matilda Street Bridge, through the new Matilda Street Pocket Park and behind the BBC offices on Shoreham Street, before entering the Shoreham Street culvert beneath Leadmill Road and the A61 road. It surfaces briefly to run along the back edge of Sheffield Station car park, and enters the station culvert, which joins the culvert carrying the River Sheaf beneath the station platforms. The junction is beneath platform 5A, where there is a wooden access cover.

==Physical modification==
The river channel has been heavily modified over centuries. This has included the construction of dams to impound water for milling and metal working. The earliest mentions are of Shepherd Wheel, possibly in 1566 and certainly in 1584, while Mayfield corn mill on Mayfield Brook is mentioned in 1641. Expansion took place in the 18th century, and by 1780 there were 20 mills, with no obvious locations left where others could be built. Weirs were built with no thought for the ecology of the river, and while most were constructed to feed water into a dam at the side of the channel, the Fullwood mill impounded the whole of the flow of Mayfield Brook, as did Forge mill on the Porter Brook.

Below its junction with the River Sheaf, the tunnels which carry the combined waters under Sheffield Station and the Castlegate area have been celebrated by urban explorers and include a huge cavern known as the &#x27;Megatron&#x27;. However, a significant proportion of the Porter Brook is also heavily culverted as it meets the city. The river in the vicinity of Matilda Street was rerouted into a new straight channel between 1797 and 1808, bypassing several meanders. The channel was still open in 1832, as shown by Taylor&#x27;s map of Sheffield, but when the first Ordnance Survey map of the area was published in 1853, parts of the Porter Brook had been culverted, to allow housing and industrial buildings to be built. This included a bone mill, and later a timber yard, with further sections having been culverted by 1891 to accommodate industrial expansion.

Sheffield station opened in 1870, and was built over an area previously known as Sheaf Island, as it was hemmed in by the River Sheaf to the east, the Porter Brook cross link to the Sheaf to the south, and an unnamed dam, Bamford Dam and Pond Forge dam to the west. Both rivers had been diverted in the late 1700s, as the Bamford dam was built over the redundant course of the Sheaf, and around 1778 the Porter Brook was diverted along a cross link which ran due east to a new junction with the Sheaf. The Midland Railway bought the water rights in 1868, and effectively closed down Pond Forge. Both rivers were culverted to enable the construction of the station to proceed, and the cross link became the main channel of the Porter Brook when the dams were later filled in.

The Porter Brook is prone to flooding within the city, because it has been hemmed in to narrow channels between buildings, and passes through culverts that are of inadequate size for storm flows. Sheffield began to research the concepts of de-culvering or daylighting rivers in 2008, but found that while there were a significant number of documented projects, there were very few where the outcomes of the daylighting were critically assessed. They set about collecting such information through a web-based approach. In 2011 they embarked on two daylighting projects on the Porter Brook, one rural and one urban. The headwaters had been culverted in Victorian times, and these had been daylighted by 2013. The urban project was at Matilda Street, and took rather longer to complete, not being finished until 2016.

The chosen site is in Sheffield&#x27;s Cultural Industries Quarter, close the buildings used by BBC Sheffield and the University Technical College on Shoreham Street. The river was in a channel with vertical sides, with steel beams running over it, before it disappeared into the Shoreham Street culvert. To the north was an area of derelict land, used for car parking, and the area was overgrown. A semi-circular amphitheatre was created, leading down to the river. A chance meeting been the landscape architect Sam Thorn and Paul Gaskell of the Wild Trout Trust near the start of the project led to a rethinking of how the river would be handled, and resulted in it being re-naturalised, rather than beautified. The pocket park has two main functions, for as well as providing public green space within an area of the city which has few such facilities, it is also designed to flood under storm conditions, slowing down the progress of water further downstream. Funding came from the council&#x27;s City Centre Breathing Spaces programme, the South Yorkshire Forest Partnership, the Environment Agency Local Levy, because of its flood defence aspect, and the European Union under the Interreg IVB SEEDS project, which funded the feasibility study.

The project was announced as the winner in the &quot;Contribution to the Built Environment&quot;’ category at the 2016 Living Waterways Awards ceremony, held by the Canal and River Trust in Birmingham Town Hall on 14 September 2016. While the pocket park only covers of the river, the council are negotiating with other landowners and looking at redevelopment of some sites to extend the length of river that is improved. There are also proposals to create a walking and cycle route that follows the course of the river. One possible redevelopment site is Decathlon Sportswear, where part of the car park is unusable because the roof of the culvert collapsed into the river in January 2017.

Major engineering work took place at Endcliffe Park in 2004-5, to reduce the impact of overflows from the sewage system under storm conditions, and to reduce the likelihood of flooding on the lower river. In September 2014 Sheffield City Council announced plans for a flood alleviation scheme on the Porter Brook and its tributary the Mayfield Brook. It was planned to create floodwater storage areas at Mayfield, Whiteley Woods and Endcliffe Park while parts of the watercourse would be contained by walled defences downstream of Endcliffe Park. The work on the Porter Brook and the Sheaf was costed at £12.4 million, and was part of a larger project costing £56 million. Work started in 2015, and was expected to be completed in 2021.

==Water power==

The Porter Brook, like the other rivers in Sheffield, is ideally suited for providing water power, as the final section falls some in a little over . This enabled dams to be constructed reasonably close together, without the outflow from one mill being restricted by the next downstream dam. In addition to this water-power, natural sandstone was available in abundance in the nearby hills of Sheffield and the Peak District National Park. Lying at the edge of these hills, mill-owners found Millstone Grit was an easily extractable resource. By 1740 Sheffield became the most extensive user of water-power in Britain and probably in Europe. Ninety mills had been built, two-thirds of them for grinding. By 1850 these mills numbered well over 100. In the Porter valley alone 21 mill dams served 19 water-wheels, mostly used for grinding corn, operating forge-hammers, and rolling mills, grinding knives and the various types of blade that made Sheffield famous. Most were active during the 18th and 19th centuries.

* Fulwood Cornmill
A mill is known to have existed at Fulwood in 1641, when Ulysses Fox its builder appeared before the Court of Kings Bench changed with &quot;trespass&quot;, as the rights to grind corn were owned by the manor. Despite having to pay £35 8s 9d (£35.43) the mill survived. Later, there were two wheels served by two dams lying between Mill Lane and Mark Lane in Mayfield Valley above Forge Dam. In 1760 the mill was used by Thomas Boulsover for the production of Sheffield-plate buttons. A steam engine was used at the Nether or lower mill from 1847, and both were unused by 1884. The complex was given to Sheffield Corporation in 1937, but most of it has since been demolished. Unlike most installations in Sheffield, the dam impounded the whole of the flow from the Mayfield Brook, with the result that the dam (the normal local term for the lake, rather than the structure that creates the lake) has completely silted up.
* Forge Dam (extant) c.1760 to c.1887
This workshop was built by Thomas Boulsover, the inventor of Sheffield Plate. It was also known as ‘Upper Forge’, ‘Whiteley Wood Forge’ &quot;and&quot; ‘Bottoms Forge and Tilt’ and was used for the manufacture of saws.

Sometime before 1900 the dam became a boating pool.

Thomas Boulsover first used this site for the production of writing paper, but this was unsuccessful, as the water contained ochre. By 1765, it had become a forge and rolling mill, and by 1832 was used for the production of saws, while two drop-hammers were used to beat heated metal ingots into wrought-iron. Two water wheels were supplemented by a steam engine in 1835, and the operation ceased around 1887. A showman called Herbert Maxfield used the dam as a boating pool between 1900 and 1920, and the site was bought by Sheffield Corporation in 1939. The workers’ cottages became a café. The weir is still in good condition, but the dam has suffered from silting, as its layout was similar to the Fulwood dam.

* Wiremill Dam (extant) c.1761 to c.1876 – Previously Whiteley Wood Rolling Mill, also known as Bowser Bottom or Thomas Boulsover&#x27;s Rolling Mill.

This workshop was built by Thomas Boulsover, the inventor of Sheffield Plate. It was originally part of ‘Whiteley Wood rolling mill and a saw works’. 

The mill produced thin steel plate suitable for sawplate and for other items fashioned from strip steel, and wire used mainly in the cutlery industry. Wiremill Dam was once the site of the largest diameter water-wheel in Sheffield. Two overshot wheels were recorded in 1829, each in diameter and wide. They rotated at 6 rpm and were fed by a head of water of about .

It gained its Wire Mill name in 1855 when it was used for wire drawing.

* Nether Wheel 1754 to c.1891
This workshop was also known as ‘Porter Wheel’, ‘Holme Wheel’, &quot;and&quot; ‘Whiteley Wood Bottoms Wheel and Shops’. It had a 20ft fall, six working troughs, and was used for cutlery grinding until 1891.

By 1901 the mill was declared ‘empty’ and demolished in 1907.
* Shepherd Wheel (extant)
This was originally called Porter Wheel, and was mentioned in a will read in 1566. From 1749, it was leased to Edward Shepherd, and the wheel was then known by his name. He worked there until he died in 1794, when it passed to his son-in-law. Samuel Hind began working there when aged ten in 1818, and the Hind(e) family were associated with it until about 1930, when commercial operation ceased. The leaseholder was John Eyre, who bought the wheel from the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s estate in 1811, and ownership passed to Sheffield Corporation in the late 1890s, although the transaction was not completed until 1908. After 1930, the wheel was maintained and occasionally demonstrated by the forerunner of the South Yorkshire Industrial History Society until 1941. Its condition deteriorated, and it was almost demolished, but the Council for the Conservation of Sheffield Antiquities renovated it, and it was given to the City Museums. It is now run as a museum by the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust.

* Ibbotson&#x27;s Wheel (extant) 1754 to 1902 – previously Upper Spurgear Wheel or 4th Endcliffe Wheel.
This workshop was also known as ‘New Wheel’, &quot;and&quot; ‘Cutler Wheel’. It became ‘Ibbotson Wheel’ in 1775 and had a 22ft fall of water with 11 working troughs.

The first wheel on this site was erected by Stephen Hawksworth in 1754, but it was operated by Josepoh Ibbotson from 1759, and became known by his name from 1775. After his death, it was bought by Ebenezer Marsden, who opposed the Water Works Bill in 1835, and was charged an extra £7 rate because of his stance. In 1847, the wheel was subjected to rattening, when unknown people entered the building and broke five of the grindstones. Ownership was transferred to Sheffield Corporation, who gave the Ibbotsons notice to quit in 1902. A proposal in the 1930s for it to become an industrial museum came to nothing, and it was demolished around 1950. During the early 1900s the dam became Porter Glen Boating Lake.

* Nether Spurgear Wheel (extant) 1749 to c.1875 – also known as 3rd Endcliffe Wheel
Initially this workshop had 10 working troughs. By 1830 it had been enlarged to include 17, which were driven by a 23ft diameter wheel. Nether Spurgear Wheel was mainly used to power a cutlers’ workshop, with a brief period being used by a filesmith.
* Second Endcliffe Wheel
* Holme Wheel (extant) 1724 to c.1891 – also known as Nether Mill, Leather Wheel, or Whiteley Woods Bottoms Wheel (1754).
When first built, this workshop had 4 working troughs which were used by cutlers. It was rebuilt in 1769 and by 1830 had expanded to 17 troughs to produce high quality blades. 

Endcliffe Park was re-opened in 1887 to commemorate the Jubilee of Queen Victoria following major re-design and landscaping by landscape architect William Goldring. From about 1903 the dam was used as a boating lake.

Porter Valley Parks are all part of the Sheffield Round Walk.
* First Endcliffe Wheel – 1706 to c. 1891
This workshop was also known as ‘Elcliffe Wheel’ and was used for the manufacture of scissors. It had a 19ft fall of water and later had 10 working troughs used for knife grinding. The dam was used as a bathing pool from about 1903 until 1938. It was closed at the outbreak of World War II. Some 20 years later it was drained and filled in.
* Upper Lescar Wheel This cutlers wheel and the Nether Lescar Wheel took their names from the marshy area, Leeche Carr by the Porter Brook, carr (or &quot;kjarr)&quot; being Old Norse for a wetland undergoing transition to a woodland. The wheel existed in 1587. This dam was to supply power to the Porter Steel Works until 1890 when the works closed.
* Nether Lescar Wheel Dam Records indicate that this cutlers wheel existed in 1587. In 1630 John Bamforth paid £2-00 and two hens per annum to the Lord of the Manor to rent this wheel. This dam also supplied power to the Porter Steel Works.
* Porter Works Dam
Both Lescar Wheels and Porter Works Dams were drained to provide housing between Ecclesall Road and Sharrow Vale Road.

* Sharrow Mills
Sharrow Wheel was in use by cutlers by 1604, and was sometimes known as Bamforth Wheel, as it was leased to members of the Bamforth family from then until 1719. In the mid 1740s, Joseph Wilson enlarged the wheel, and in 1757 plans were drawn up for changes to the tail goit, which was carried under the river in a culvert, to rejoin the river further downstream. A snuff mill was erected in 1763, and the cutler wheel was not mentioned subsequently. The Wilson family bought the freehold from the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s estate in 1798, and have run the mill ever since. The water-powered snuff grinding equipment remains in place, although it is no longer used to grind snuff commercially.

* Stalker Wheel also known as Three-Square Dams
Lying between Ecclesall Road and the high wall stone wall of Sheffield General Cemetery.

* Sharrow Forge
Drained and filled in, 1870. The land was developed to build houses in Napier Street and St Matthias Primary School.

* Broomhall Cornmill
Also drained and filled in, 1870.

* Bennett&#x27;s Wheel also known as Little Sheffield Moor or Vulcan Works Dam
The original grinding wheel (1810–1851) closed and the dam was leased to the Vulcan Works a forge, and rolling-mill providing water for boilers.
* Leadmill Dam also known as Marriott&#x27;s Wheel (1732–1780s).
The White Lead Works was erected in 1759 producing pigments for paint and pottery glazes and continued in use until the later 19th century. When it closed, the dam was filled in and the site used to construct a tram-depot 1910. 
* Ponds Lane Dam

The Peak Park Anniversary Cycle Route follows the Porter Brook from Bingham Park to Porter Clough near Ringinglow.

==Water quality==
The brook derives its name from its brownish colour, similar to the colour of Porter beer.
The discolouration is created as the water passes through and over local iron-ore deposits.

The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail. The Porter Brook is designated as &quot;heavily modified&quot;, which means that the channels have been altered by human activity, and the criteria for this designation are defined by the Water Framework Directive.

The water quality of the Porter Brook was as follows in 2019.
The water quality in the river has deteriorated since 2013, when it was rated good for ecological status. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

== Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust ==

The Sheaf &amp; Porter Rivers Trust is a voluntary organisation set up on 15 May 2019, to promote public awareness of the two urban rivers and their gradual regeneration.

The trust is one of several organisations which promote remediation of these rivers, including Sheffield Corporation. The trust believe that remedial action on the lower Sheaf and Porter would improve biodiversity, as well as the health and wellbeing of the increasing population of the inner city. At the time of its formation, there were significant re-development projects taking place on the lower Porter, which gave scope to improve the level of daylight on the river and to create public spaces. A retail outlet has been persuaded not to replace the culvert roof where their car park had collapsed into the river, and the Trust are working with the Environment Agency to ensure that the exposed river gets re-naturalised. They have also negotiated with the BBC, where the river runs beneath the car park. It included a section where the exposed river was totally overgrown, to the extent that the owners did not realise there was a river. As of May 2022, the intention is to cut back the growth and so let light into the river.

The Trust are also promoting the creation of a larger park where the combined waters of the Porter and Sheaf flow into the Don. The final culvert through which they run is decaying, and the trust would like to see it removed. They would also like to see light wells added throughout the rest of the culverts, to enable wildlife to pass through them to reach the upper rivers, and believe that redevelopment as part of the HS2 high speed rail link could be the catalyst for that to take place. They are also seeking a continuous path along the river bank, joining the current disconnected sections.

==Popular culture==
The river is one of several which inspired the song &quot;Wickerman&quot; by Pulp.

The Sheffield morris dance group, Five Rivers Morris, who take their name from the city&#x27;s waterways, have a dance called &#x27;Porter&#x27; after the Porter Brook.

The Porter Brook featured heavily in a 2016 BBC Radio 4 documentary entitled &quot;A River of Steel&quot;, produced by sound recordist Chris Watson, ex-member of Caberet Voltaire. The programme included discussion of the recently completed Porter Brook daylighting scheme, which also featured in an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

<doc id="319159" wikidata="Q8053059" url="?curid=319159" title="Murder of Yetunde Price">
<text>Yetunde Hawanya Tara Price (August 9, 1972 – September 14, 2003) was the oldest half-sister of and personal assistant to tennis players Venus and Serena Williams. On September 14, 2003, she was murdered in a drive-by shooting in Compton, California, United States by Robert Maxfield.

==Background==
Yetunde was the oldest of Oracene Price&#x27;s five daughters. She was one of Venus and Serena Williams’ three other sisters, a half-sibling from a previous marriage between their mother, tennis coach Oracene Price, and Yusef Rasheed.

For a time, Price worked as a personal assistant to her tennis-playing sisters and as a nurse. At the time of her death, she also owned a hair salon. According to media reports, Price, despite &quot;accepting some financial assistance&quot; from her sisters, continued to live with her children in their house in a &#x27;run-down&#x27; district and continued to work as a nurse, also engaging in her personal-assistant responsibilities which saw her appear at Wimbledon in the year of her death. According to the reports, Price was &quot;determined to pay her own way in the world.&quot; Price was the mother of three children.

==Murder==
On the night of September 14, 2003, Price was chatting with her boyfriend in her SUV, parked outside what subsequently was revealed to be a crack house in suburban Compton, Los Angeles County. According to the prosecution at the subsequent trial, two members of the South Side Compton Crips street gang who were guarding the house, opened fire on the SUV in the belief that they were &quot;defending [the] crack house from gangland rivals&quot;, presumably the Lime Hood Piru. Price&#x27;s boyfriend, who later stated he did not realize that Price had been shot, drove her to a relative&#x27;s home, where he called emergency services. Price was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital, from a bullet wound to the head.

Both the prosecutor and the defense at the murder trial agreed that Price was an innocent victim passing through the area.

==Trial==
Southside Compton Crips street gang member Robert Edward Maxfield, 25 years old at the time of his conviction, pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter on March 22, 2006, the day before his third trial for Yetunde Price&#x27;s killing was scheduled to start. The first two trials had ended in mistrials after jurors were unable to reach a verdict. The first trial ended in November 2004 with six jurors voting for acquittal, five for guilt, and one undecided. A second mistrial was declared April 29, 2005, when jurors deadlocked at 11–1 in favor of conviction.

A murder charge against a second defendant, who was accused of firing a handgun during the incident, was dismissed after the first trial, when authorities stated he did not cause the fatal wound.

On April 6, 2006, Judge Steven Suzukawa sentenced Maxfield to 15 years in prison with the possibility of parole. He was released in 2018, but was subsequently re-arrested after violating his parole.

==Aftermath==
Compton rapper the Game dedicated his 2005 song &quot;Dreams&quot; to Yetunde Price&#x27;s memory.

In 2016, the Williams sisters opened a community center in Compton for &quot;victims of violence and their families&quot;, called the Yetunde Price Resource Center. Its tagline reads: &quot;Committed to helping others heal&quot;.

On March 8, 2018, Maxfield, was released on parole from the Deuel Vocational Institution in Tracy, California, having served approximately 12 years of a 15 year sentence in prison. He was re-arrested later that year for violating parole.

In an interview with &quot;TIME&quot;, Serena Williams said she learned of his release on July 31, through Instagram, ten minutes before her match against Johanna Konta at the 2018 Silicon Valley Classic, a match she went on to lose 6–1, 6–0 to Konta in 52 minutes.

<text>NGC 2070 (also known as Caldwell 103) is a large open cluster and candidate super star cluster forming the heart of the bright region in the centre-south-east of the Large Magellanic Cloud. This cluster was discovered by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752. It is at the centre of the Tarantula Nebula and produces most of the energy that makes the latter&#x27;s gas and dust visible. Its central condensation is the star cluster R136, one of the most energetic star clusters known. Among its stars are many of great dimension, including the second most massive star known, R136a1, at 215 and 6.16 million .

<text>William David Labov ( ; December 4, 1927 – December 17, 2024) was an American linguist widely regarded as the founder of the discipline of variationist sociolinguistics. He has been described as &quot;an enormously original and influential figure who has created much of the methodology&quot; of sociolinguistics, and &quot;one of the most influential linguists of the 20th and 21st centuries&quot;.

Labov was a professor in the linguistics department of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and pursued research in sociolinguistics, language change, and dialectology. He retired in 2015 but continued to publish research until his death in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Labov was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and raised in Rutherford, moving to Fort Lee at age 12. According to Labov, the physician who delivered him was William Carlos Williams. He attended Harvard University, where he majored in English and philosophy and studied chemistry. He graduated from Harvard in 1948.

==Career==
After graduating from Harvard, Labov worked as an industrial chemist in his family&#x27;s business (1949–61) before turning to linguistics. For his MA thesis (1963) he completed a study of change in the dialect of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, which he presented before the Linguistic Society of America. Labov took his PhD (1964) at Columbia University, studying under Uriel Weinreich. He was an assistant professor of linguistics at Columbia (1964–70) before becoming an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, then a full professor, and in 1976 becoming director of the university&#x27;s Linguistics Laboratory.

==Linguistic research==
The methods Labov used to collect data for his study of the varieties of English spoken in New York City, published as &quot;The Social Stratification of English in New York City&quot; (1966), have been influential in social dialectology. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, his studies of the linguistic features of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) were also influential: he argued that AAVE should not be stigmatized as substandard, but rather respected as a variety of English with its own grammatical rules.

He also pursued research in referential indeterminacy and is noted for his studies of the way ordinary people structure narrative stories of their own lives. Several of his classes were service-based, with students going to West Philadelphia to help tutor young children while simultaneously learning linguistics from different dialects such as AAVE.

Later, Labov studied ongoing changes in the phonology of English as spoken in the U.S., as well as the origins and patterns of chain shifts of vowels (one sound replacing a second, replacing a third, in a complete chain). In the &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot; (2006), he and his co-authors find three major divergent chain shifts taking place today: a Southern Shift (in Appalachia and southern coastal regions); a Northern Cities Vowel Shift affecting a region from Madison, Wisconsin, east to Utica, New York; and a Canadian Shift affecting most of Canada, in addition to several minor chain shifts in smaller regions.

Among Labov&#x27;s well-known students are Charles Boberg, Anne H. Charity Hudley, Penelope Eckert, Gregory Guy, Robert A. Leonard, Geoffrey Nunberg, Shana Poplack, and John R. Rickford. His methods were adopted in England around 1972 by Peter Trudgill for Norwich speech and K. M. Petyt for West Yorkshire speech. On a sabbatical in England shortly after, J. K. Chambers, reading Trudgill&#x27;s tattered copy of &quot;Sociolinguistic Patterns&quot;, left formal linguistics to become a sociolinguist.

Labov&#x27;s works include &quot;The Study of Nonstandard English&quot; (1969), &quot;Language in the Inner City: Studies in Black English Vernacular&quot; (1972), &quot;Sociolinguistic Patterns&quot; (1972), &quot;Principles of Linguistic Change&quot; (vol.I Internal Factors, 1994; vol.II Social Factors, 2001, vol.III Cognitive and Cultural factors, 2010), and, with Sharon Ash and Charles Boberg, &quot;The Atlas of North American English&quot; (2006).

The Franklin Institute awarded Labov the 2013 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science, citing him for &quot;establishing the cognitive basis of language variation and change through rigorous analysis of linguistic data, and for the study of non-standard dialects with significant social and cultural implications&quot;.

==Language in use==
In &quot;Narrative Analysis: Oral Versions of Personal Experience&quot;, Labov and Joshua Waletzky take a sociolinguistic approach to examine how language works between people. This is significant because it contextualizes the study of structure and form, connecting purpose to method. His stated purpose is to &quot;isolate the elements of narrative&quot;. This work focuses exclusively on oral narratives.

Labov describes narrative as having two functions: referential and evaluative, with its &quot;referential&quot; functions orienting and grounding a story in its contextual world by referencing events in sequential order as they originally occurred, and its &quot;evaluative&quot; functions describing the storyteller&#x27;s purpose in telling the story. Formally analyzing data from orally generated texts obtained via observed group interaction and interview (600 interviews were taken from several studies whose participants included ethnically diverse groups of children and adults from various backgrounds), Labov divides narrative into five or six sections:

* &quot;Abstract&quot; – gives an overview of the story.
* &quot;Orientation&quot; – Labov describes this as &quot;referential [free clauses that] serve to orient the listener in respect to person, place, time, and behavioral situation&quot;. He specifies that these are contextual clues that precede the main story.
* &quot;Complicating action&quot; – the main story, during which the narrative unfolds. A story may consist of multiple complication sections.
* &quot;Evaluation&quot; – author evinces self-awareness, giving explicit or implicit purpose to the retelling of the story. Thus evaluation gives some indication of the significance the author attributes to their story. But evaluation can be done subtly: for instance, &quot;lexical intensifiers [are a type of] semantically defined evaluation&quot;.
* &quot;Resolution&quot; – occurs sequentially following the evaluation. The resolution may give the story a sense of completion.
* &quot;Coda&quot; – returns listener to the present, drawing them back out of the world of the story into the world of the storytelling event. A coda is not essential to a narrative, and some narratives do not have one.

While not every narrative includes all these elements, the purpose of this subdivision is to show that narratives have inherent structural order. Labov argues that narrative units must retell events in the order they were experienced because narrative is &quot;temporally sequenced&quot;. In other words, events do not occur at random but are connected to one another; thus &quot;the original semantic interpretation&quot; depends on their original order. To demonstrate this sequence, he breaks a story down into its basic parts. He defines &quot;narrative clause&quot; as the &quot;basic unit of narrative&quot; around which everything else is built. Clauses can be distinguished from one another by &quot;temporal junctures&quot;, which indicate a shift in time and separate narrative clauses. Temporal junctures mark temporal sequencing because clauses cannot be rearranged without disrupting their meaning.

Labov and Waletzky&#x27;s findings are important because they derived them from actual data rather than abstract theorization. Labov, Waletzky, &amp;c., set up interviews and documented speech patterns in storytelling, keeping with the ethnographic tradition of tape-recording oral text so it can be referenced exactly. This inductive method creates a new system through which to understand story text.

==Linguistic principles==
One of Labov&#x27;s contributions to theories of language change is his &quot;Golden Age Principle&quot; (or &quot;Golden Age Theory&quot;). It claims that any changes in the sounds or the grammar that have come to conscious awareness in a speech community trigger a uniformly negative reaction.

==Scholarly influence and criticism==
Labov&#x27;s seminal work has been referenced and critically examined by a number of scholars, mainly for its structural rigidity. Kristin Langellier explains that &quot;the purpose of Labovian analysis is to relate the formal properties of the narrative to their functions&quot;: clause-level analysis of how text affects transmission of message. This model has several flaws, which Langellier points out: it examines textual structure to the exclusion of context and audience, which often act to shape the text; it is relevant to a specific demographic (may be difficult to extrapolate); and, by categorizing the text at a clausal level, it burdens analysis with theoretical distinctions that may not be illuminating in practice. Anna De Fina remarks that [within Labov&#x27;s model] &quot;the defining property of narrative is temporal sequence, since the order in which the events are presented in the narrative is expected to match the original events as they occurred&quot;, which differs from more contemporary notions of storytelling, in which a naturally time-conscious flow includes jumping forward and back in time as mandated by, for example, anxieties felt about futures and their interplay with subsequent decisions. De Fina and Langellier both note that, though wonderfully descriptive, Labov&#x27;s model is nevertheless difficult to code, thus potentially limited in application/practice. De Fina also agrees with Langellier that Labov&#x27;s model ignores the complex and often quite relevant subject of intertextuality in narrative. To an extent, Labov evinces awareness of these concerns, saying &quot;it is clear that these conclusions are restricted to the speech communities that we have examined&quot;, and &quot;the overall structure of the narratives we&#x27;ve examined is not uniform&quot;. In &quot;Rethinking Ventriloquism&quot;, Diane Goldstein uses Labovian notions of tellability—internal coherence in narrative—to inform her concept of &quot;untellability&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Labov had five children from his first marriage to Teresa Gnasso Labov: Susannah Page, Sarah Labov, Simon Labov, Joanna Labov, and Jessie Labov. In 1993, he married fellow sociolinguist Gillian Sankoff, and they had two children: Rebecca Labov and sociologist Alice Goffman, the latter of whom Labov adopted after the death of Sankoff&#x27;s previous husband, Erving Goffman. 

William Labov died at his home in Philadelphia on December 17, 2024, at the age of 97 from complications due to Parkinson&#x27;s.

==Honors==
In 1968, Labov received the David H. Russell Award for Distinguished Research in Teaching English.

He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1970–71 and 1987–88.

Labov received honorary doctorates from, among others, the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University (1985) and University of Edinburgh (2005).

In 1996, he won the Leonard Bloomfield Book Award from the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) for &quot;Principles of Linguistic Change, Vol. 1&quot;.; he won the Award again in 2008 as a coauthor of the &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot;.

In 2013, Labov received a Franklin Institute Award in Computer and Cognitive Science for &quot;establishing the cognitive basis of language variation and change through rigorous analysis of linguistic data, and for the study of non-standard dialects with significant social and cultural implications.&quot;

In 2013, Universitat Pompeu Fabra awarded Labov an honorary doctorate for &quot;his brilliant teaching and research track record and for being one of the leading figures in the field of linguistics, founder of variationist and quantitative sociolinguistics&quot;.

In 2015, he was awarded the Neil and Saras Smith Medal for Linguistics by the British Academy &quot;for lifetime achievement in the scholarly study of linguistics&quot; and &quot;his significant contribution to linguistics and the language sciences&quot;.

In 2020, Labov was awarded the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&#x27; Talcott Parsons Prize, recognizing &quot;distinguished and original contributions to the social sciences&quot;.

<doc id="319168" wikidata="Q212057" url="?curid=319168" title="Shield volcano">
<text>A shield volcano is a type of volcano named for its low profile, resembling a shield lying on the ground. It is formed by the eruption of highly fluid (low viscosity) lava, which travels farther and forms thinner flows than the more viscous lava erupted from a stratovolcano. Repeated eruptions result in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano&#x27;s distinctive form.

Shield volcanoes are found wherever fluid, low-silica lava reaches the surface of a rocky planet. However, they are most characteristic of ocean island volcanism associated with hot spots or with continental rift volcanism. They include the largest active volcanoes on Earth, such as Mauna Loa. Giant shield volcanoes are found on other planets of the Solar System, including Olympus Mons on Mars and Sapas Mons on Venus.

== Etymology ==
The term &#x27;shield volcano&#x27; is taken from the German term &quot;Schildvulkan&quot;, coined by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in 1888 and which had been calqued into English by 1910.

== Geology ==
=== Structure ===
Shield volcanoes are distinguished from the three other major volcanic types—stratovolcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones—by their structural form, a consequence of their particular magmatic composition. Of these four forms, shield volcanoes erupt the least viscous lavas. Whereas stratovolcanoes and lava domes are the product of highly viscous flows, and cinder cones are constructed of explosively eruptive tephra, shield volcanoes are the product of gentle effusive eruptions of highly fluid lavas that produce, over time, a broad, gently sloped eponymous &quot;shield&quot;. Although the term is generally applied to basaltic shields, it has also at times been applied to rarer volcanoes of differing magmatic composition—principally pyroclastic shields, formed by the accumulation of fragmentary material from particularly powerful explosive eruptions, and rarer felsic lava shields formed by unusually fluid felsic magmas. Examples of pyroclastic shields include Billy Mitchell volcano in Papua New Guinea and the Purico complex in Chile; an example of a felsic shield is the Ilgachuz Range in British Columbia, Canada. Shield volcanoes are similar in origin to vast lava plateaus and flood basalts present in various parts of the world. These are eruptive features which occur along linear fissure vents and are distinguished from shield volcanoes by the lack of an identifiable primary eruptive center.

Active shield volcanoes experience near-continuous eruptive activity over extremely long periods of time, resulting in the gradual build-up of edifices that can reach extremely large dimensions. With the exclusion of flood basalts, mature shields are the largest volcanic features on Earth. The summit of the largest subaerial volcano in the world, Mauna Loa, lies above sea level, and the volcano, over wide at its base, is estimated to contain about of basalt. The mass of the volcano is so great that it has slumped the crust beneath it a further . Accounting for this subsidence and for the height of the volcano above the sea floor, the &quot;true&quot; height of Mauna Loa from the start of its eruptive history is about . Mount Everest, by comparison, is in height. In 2013, a team led by the University of Houston&#x27;s William Sager announced the discovery of Tamu Massif, an enormous extinct submarine volcano, approximately in area, which dwarfs all previously known volcanoes on Earth. However, the extents of the volcano have not been confirmed. Although Tamu Massif was initially believed to be a shield volcano, Sanger and his colleagues acknowledged in 2019 that Tamu Massif is not a shield volcano. 

Shield volcanoes feature a gentle (usually 2° to 3°) slope that gradually steepens with elevation (reaching approximately 10°) before flattening near the summit, forming an overall upwardly convex shape. These slope characteristics have a correlation with age of the forming lava, with in the case of the Hawaiian chain, steepness increasing with age, as later lavas tend to be more alkali so are more viscous, with thicker flows, that travel less distance from the summit vents. In height they are typically about one twentieth their width. Although the general form of a &quot;typical&quot; shield volcano varies little worldwide, there are regional differences in their size and morphological characteristics. Typical shield volcanoes found in California and Oregon measure in diameter and in height, while shield volcanoes in the central Mexican Michoacán–Guanajuato volcanic field average in height and in width, with an average slope angle of 9.4° and an average volume of .

Rift zones are a prevalent feature on shield volcanoes that is rare on other volcanic types. The large, decentralized shape of Hawaiian volcanoes as compared to their smaller, symmetrical Icelandic cousins can be attributed to rift eruptions. Fissure venting is common in Hawaii; most Hawaiian eruptions begin with a so-called &quot;wall of fire&quot; along a major fissure line before centralizing to a small number of points. This accounts for their asymmetrical shape, whereas Icelandic volcanoes follow a pattern of central eruptions dominated by summit calderas, causing the lava to be more evenly distributed or symmetrical.

=== Eruptive characteristics ===

Most of what is currently known about shield volcanic eruptive character has been gleaned from studies done on the volcanoes of Hawaii Island, by far the most intensively studied of all shields because of their scientific accessibility; the island lends its name to the slow-moving, effusive eruptions typical of shield volcanism, known as Hawaiian eruptions. These eruptions, the least explosive of volcanic events, are characterized by the effusive emission of highly fluid basaltic lavas with low gaseous content. These lavas travel a far greater distance than those of other eruptive types before solidifying, forming extremely wide but relatively thin magmatic sheets often less than thick. Low volumes of such lavas layered over long periods of time are what slowly constructs the characteristically low, broad profile of a mature shield volcano.

Also unlike other eruptive types, Hawaiian eruptions often occur at decentralized fissure vents, beginning with large &quot;curtains of fire&quot; that quickly die down and concentrate at specific locations on the volcano&#x27;s rift zones. Central-vent eruptions, meanwhile, often take the form of large lava fountains (both continuous and sporadic), which can reach heights of hundreds of meters or more. The particles from lava fountains usually cool in the air before hitting the ground, resulting in the accumulation of cindery scoria fragments; however, when the air is especially thick with pyroclasts, they cannot cool off fast enough because of the surrounding heat, and hit the ground still hot, accumulating into spatter cones. If eruptive rates are high enough, they may even form splatter-fed lava flows. Hawaiian eruptions are often extremely long-lived; Puʻu ʻŌʻō, a cinder cone of Kīlauea, erupted continuously from January 3, 1983, until April 2018.

Flows from Hawaiian eruptions can be divided into two types by their structural characteristics: pāhoehoe lava which is relatively smooth and flows with a ropey texture, and ʻaʻā flows which are denser, more viscous (and thus slower moving) and blockier. These lava flows can be anywhere between thick. Aā lava flows move through pressure— the partially solidified front of the flow steepens because of the mass of flowing lava behind it until it breaks off, after which the general mass behind it moves forward. Though the top of the flow quickly cools down, the molten underbelly of the flow is buffered by the solidifying rock above it, and by this mechanism, aā flows can sustain movement for long periods of time. Pāhoehoe flows, in contrast, move in more conventional sheets, or by the advancement of lava &quot;toes&quot; in snaking lava columns. Increasing viscosity on the part of the lava or shear stress on the part of local topography can morph a pāhoehoe flow into an ʻaʻā one, but the reverse never occurs.

Although most shield volcanoes are by volume almost entirely Hawaiian and basaltic in origin, they are rarely exclusively so. Some volcanoes, such as Mount Wrangell in Alaska and Cofre de Perote in Mexico, exhibit large enough swings in their historical magmatic eruptive characteristics to cast strict categorical assignment in doubt; one geological study of de Perote went so far as to suggest the term &quot;compound shield-like volcano&quot; instead. Most mature shield volcanoes have multiple cinder cones on their flanks, the results of tephra ejections common during incessant activity and markers of currently and formerly active sites on the volcano. An example of these parasitic cones is at Puʻu ʻŌʻō on Kīlauea—continuous activity ongoing since 1983 has built up a tall cone at the site of one of the longest-lasting rift eruptions in known history.

The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are not located near any plate boundaries; the volcanic activity of this island chain is distributed by the movement of the oceanic plate over an upwelling of magma known as a hotspot. Over millions of years, the tectonic movement that moves continents also creates long volcanic trails across the seafloor. The Hawaiian and Galápagos shields, and other hotspot shields like them, are constructed of oceanic island basalt. Their lavas are characterized by high levels of sodium, potassium, and aluminium.

Features common in shield volcanism include lava tubes. Lava tubes are cave-like volcanic straights formed by the hardening of overlaying lava. These structures help further the propagation of lava, as the walls of the tube insulate the lava within. Lava tubes can account for a large portion of shield volcano activity; for example, an estimated 58% of the lava forming Kīlauea comes from lava tubes.

In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava pours out of a long fissure instead of a central vent, and shrouds the countryside with a long band of volcanic material in the form of a broad plateau. Plateaus of this type exist in Iceland, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; the most prominent ones are situated along the Snake River in Idaho and the Columbia River in Washington and Oregon, where they have been measured to be over in thickness.

Calderas are a common feature on shield volcanoes. They are formed and reformed over the volcano&#x27;s lifespan. Long eruptive periods form cinder cones, which then collapse over time to form calderas. The calderas are often filled up by progressive eruptions, or formed elsewhere, and this cycle of collapse and regeneration takes place throughout the volcano&#x27;s lifespan.

Interactions between water and lava at shield volcanoes can cause some eruptions to become hydrovolcanic. These explosive eruptions are drastically different from the usual shield volcanic activity and are especially prevalent at the waterbound volcanoes of the Hawaiian Isles.

==Distribution==

Shield volcanoes are found worldwide. They can form over hotspots (points where magma from below the surface wells up), such as the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain and the Galápagos Islands, or over more conventional rift zones, such as the Icelandic shields and the shield volcanoes of East Africa. Although shield volcanoes are not usually associated with subduction, they can occur over subduction zones. Many examples are found in California and Oregon, including Prospect Peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park, as well as Pelican Butte and Belknap Crater in Oregon. Many shield volcanoes are found in ocean basins, such as Kīlauea in Hawaii, although they can be found inland as well—East Africa being one example of this.

=== Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain ===
The largest and most prominent shield volcano chain in the world is the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain, a chain of hotspot volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean. The volcanoes follow a distinct evolutionary pattern of growth and death. The chain contains at least 43 major volcanoes, and Meiji Seamount at its terminus near the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench is 85 million years old. 

The youngest part of the chain is Hawaii, where the volcanoes are characterized by frequent rift eruptions, their large size (thousands of km3 in volume), and their rough, decentralized shape. Rift zones are a prominent feature on these volcanoes and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure. They are fueled by the movement of the Pacific Plate over the Hawaii hotspot and form a long chain of volcanoes, atolls, and seamounts long with a total volume of over .

The chain includes Mauna Loa, a shield volcano which stands above sea level and reaches a further below the waterline and into the crust, approximately of rock. Kīlauea, another Hawaiian shield volcano, is one of the most active volcanoes on Earth, with its most recent eruption occurring in 2021.

=== Galápagos Islands ===
The Galápagos Islands are an isolated set of volcanoes, consisting of shield volcanoes and lava plateaus, about west of Ecuador. They are driven by the Galápagos hotspot, and are between approximately 4.2 million and 700,000 years of age. The largest island, Isabela, consists of six coalesced shield volcanoes, each delineated by a large summit caldera. Española, the oldest island, and Fernandina, the youngest, are also shield volcanoes, as are most of the other islands in the chain. The Galápagos Islands are perched on a large lava plateau known as the Galápagos Platform. This platform creates a shallow water depth of at the base of the islands, which stretch over a diameter. Since Charles Darwin&#x27;s visit to the islands in 1835 during the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;, there have been over 60 recorded eruptions in the islands, from six different shield volcanoes. Of the 21 emergent volcanoes, 13 are considered active.

Cerro Azul is a shield volcano on the southwestern part of Isabela Island and is one of the most active in the Galapagos, with the last eruption between May and June 2008. The Geophysics Institute at the National Polytechnic School in Quito houses an international team of seismologists and volcanologists whose responsibility is to monitor Ecuador&#x27;s numerous active volcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt and the Galapagos Islands. La Cumbre is an active shield volcano on Fernandina Island that has been erupting since April 11, 2009.

The Galápagos islands are geologically young for such a big chain, and the pattern of their rift zones follows one of two trends, one north-northwest, and one east–west. The composition of the lavas of the Galápagos shields are strikingly similar to those of the Hawaiian volcanoes. Curiously, they do not form the same volcanic &quot;line&quot; associated with most hotspots. They are not alone in this regard; the Cobb–Eickelberg Seamount chain in the North Pacific is another example of such a delineated chain. In addition, there is no clear pattern of age between the volcanoes, suggesting a complicated, irregular pattern of creation. How the islands were formed remains a geological mystery, although several theories have been proposed.

=== Iceland ===
Located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Iceland is the site of about 130 volcanoes of various types. Icelandic shield volcanoes are generally of Holocene age, between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The volcanoes are also very narrow in distribution, occurring in two bands in the West and North Volcanic Zones. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, their formation initially begins with several eruptive centers before centralizing and concentrating at a single point. The main shield then forms, burying the smaller ones formed by the early eruptions with its lava.

Icelandic shields are mostly small (~), symmetrical (although this can be affected by surface topography), and characterized by eruptions from summit calderas. They are composed of either tholeiitic olivine or picritic basalt. The tholeiitic shields tend to be wider and shallower than the picritic shields. They do not follow the pattern of caldera growth and destruction that other shield volcanoes do; caldera may form, but they generally do not disappear.

=== Turkey ===
Bingöl Mountains are one of the shield volcanoes in Turkey.
=== East Africa ===

In East Africa, volcanic activity is generated by the development of the East African Rift and from nearby hotspots. Some volcanoes interact with both. Shield volcanoes are found near the rift and off the coast of Africa, although stratovolcanoes are more common. Although sparsely studied, the fact that all of its volcanoes are of Holocene age reflects how young the volcanic center is. One interesting characteristic of East African volcanism is a penchant for the formation of lava lakes; these semi-permanent lava bodies, extremely rare elsewhere, form in about 9% of African eruptions.

The most active shield volcano in Africa is Nyamuragira. Eruptions at the shield volcano are generally centered within the large summit caldera or on the numerous fissures and cinder cones on the volcano&#x27;s flanks. Lava flows from the most recent century extend down the flanks more than from the summit, reaching as far as Lake Kivu. Erta Ale in Ethiopia is another active shield volcano and one of the few places in the world with a permanent lava lake, which has been active since at least 1967, and possibly since 1906. Other volcanic centers include Menengai, a massive shield caldera, and Mount Marsabit in Kenya.


=== Extraterrestrial shield volcanoes ===

Shield volcanoes are not limited to Earth; they have been found on Mars, Venus, and Jupiter&#x27;s moon, Io.

The shield volcanoes of Mars are very similar to the shield volcanoes on Earth. On both planets, they have gently sloping flanks, collapse craters along their central structure, and are built of highly fluid lavas. Volcanic features on Mars were observed long before they were first studied in detail during the 1976–1979 Viking mission. The principal difference between the volcanoes of Mars and those on Earth is in terms of size; Martian volcanoes range in size up to high and in diameter, far larger than the high, wide Hawaiian shields. The highest of these, Olympus Mons, is the tallest known mountain on any planet in the solar system.

Venus has over 150 shield volcanoes which are much flatter, with a larger surface area than those found on Earth, some having a diameter of more than . Although the majority of these are long extinct it has been suggested, from observations by the Venus Express spacecraft, that many may still be active.

<doc id="319170" wikidata="Q17643392" url="?curid=319170" title="Sheffield Manor Lodge">
<text>Sheffield Manor Lodge, also known as Sheffield Manor or locally as Manor Castle, is a lodge built about 1516 in what then was a large deer park southeast of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, to provide a country retreat and further accommodate George Talbot, the 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, and his large family. The remnant of this estate is now known as Norfolk Park. The housing estate of Manor is named after Sheffield Manor Lodge. 

==Description==
The remains of Sheffield Manor Lodge include parts of the kitchens, long gallery, and the Grade II* listed Turret House (also called &quot;Queen Mary&#x27;s Tower&quot;), which contains fine sixteenth-century ceilings. Writing in the 17th century, William Dugdale noted that the heraldic decoration in the long gallery dating from around 1525 included the arms of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, and the George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury&#x27;s second wife Elizabeth Walden. 

Some evidence points to the Turret House being built by 1574, when George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury&#x27;s accounts record payments for masonry work on the &quot;Tyrret&quot; at Sheffield Manor. It has three storeys of two rooms. The stair at one corner rises above the building onto the roof. This seems to have been designed as a viewing platform and is comparable with the &quot;Hunting Tower&quot; at Chatsworth House.

On 5 August 1577, the Earl of Shrewsbury wrote to William Cecil (who was at Buxton for his health). In a postscript he mentioned that he was sending him a &quot;platt&quot; (plan) of the front or facade of a lodge that he was building. This may have been a drawing for the lodge at Sheffield, or a similar building.

==Mary, Queen of Scots==

Mary, Queen of Scots, was held prisoner by the 6th Earl of Shrewsbury at both Sheffield Manor Lodge and Sheffield Castle (her ghost is said by some to haunt the Turret House building). Wolsey&#x27;s Tower was built to accommodate Cardinal Wolsey, who then died after travelling on to Leicester.

Mary came to England in 1568 after her defeat at the battle of Langside seeking the support of the Catholic nobility. Mary&#x27;s freedom was restricted after her cousin Elizabeth was advised of the threat that Mary posed to her own crown. 

She was handed over to the custody of George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury on 4 February 1569. Talbot had armed guards watching her constantly, however she was still able, with the help of the Duke of Norfolk and others of the Catholic nobility, to plot against Elizabeth. Several times Mary had to be moved to places of greater safety and stricter control.

On 28 November 1570 she was taken to the Earl of Shrewsbury&#x27;s castle at Tutbury, where, apart from a few breaks at Chatsworth and Buxton, and more regular visits to Sheffield and the Manor House, she remained for 14 years.

Despite Mary&#x27;s actions, Elizabeth still seemed to support her cousin&#x27;s claim to the Scottish throne, and Mary wrote regularly to her supporters in Scotland asking them to be faithful and to await the help she believed Elizabeth would provide. Two of Mary&#x27;s letters are preserved in the Sheffield Archives.

The Duke of Norfolk, not long released from the Tower of London, was caught in collusion with the papal agent Roberto di Ridolfi plotting to bring about a Catholic uprising in England. Parliament demanded the execution of both Mary Stuart and Norfolk. At this stage no action was taken against Mary, but the Duke of Norfolk was beheaded in 1572.

===Material culture of a queen and her household in captivity===

Mary, Queen of Scots, wrote for turtle doves and Barbary doves to keep in a cage as companions in her captivity at Sheffield. A type of portrait showing her standing beside a table became known as the &quot;Sheffield Portrait&quot; because of two references to artists at work at Sheffield. In March 1577, Mary&#x27;s secretary Claude Nau wrote that a painter was still working and had not yet perfected the Queen&#x27;s image. Mary sat for a portrait painter at Sheffield in August 1577. She received a portrait of her son James VI at Sheffield in October 1582, sent by the French ambassador Michel de Castelnau. Later collectors and historians thought Mary&#x27;s embroiderer Pierre Oudry was a painter, and his name &quot;P. Oudry Pinxit&quot; was added Mary&#x27;s portrait at Hardwick Hall.

In 1582, while Mary was still being held at Sheffield, an inventory of all the household goods and furniture belonging to George, Earl of Shrewsbury was made. The inventory describes the castle and contents and gives an idea of the types of rooms in the castle at this date. These included a chapel, a porch going into the great hall from the great chamber (which was probably the large dining room), a wardrobe, the Lord&#x27;s chamber and outer chamber, the Lady&#x27;s chamber, a bakehouse, brewhouse, pantry, washhouse and low washhouse, a round tower, a square tower and a turret, round towers on either side of the gatehouse and walls running along the waterside, a porter&#x27;s lodge, a dungeon, a square room, little kitchen, old kitchen, a kennel and a range of stables.

A 1583 inventory made by John Dickonson and William Catterall included the &quot;stuff&quot; of the &quot;Queen of Scots and her people&quot;. Mary had a large entourage, which varied over time, made up of Scots, French and English friends and servants. The list of rooms for &quot;her people&quot; furnished by the Earl of Shrewsbury includes those of the Master of the queen&#x27;s &quot;howsholde&quot;; her secretary Claude Nau; Mademoiselle Rallay; Mary Seton; Mr Burgoing her doctor; Gilbert Curle; Mr Jarvys her &quot;surgion&quot;; Bastian Pagez; the embroiderer Pierre Oudry (his name written as &quot;Pyrawdrawe&quot;); Dedier the pantryman; Hannibal; and Scottish servant Will Black. The 1582 survey also lists the furnishings &quot;in the hawle at the Poandes&quot;, now known as the Old Queen&#x27;s Head, which included painted canvas hangings.

There was a slight earthquake on 16 February 1584. Mary wrote that her ladies were sitting on boxes and chairs working (on sewing and embroidery) on the Saturday evening when the tremor occurred.

===Letters and the Throckmorton Plot===
Mary kept up a secret correspondence with her allies. The letters, some encoded in cipher, were carried by her supporters, including George More, a local man whose uncle had a house near Sheffield Manor. In 1583, Francis Walsingham investigated her letters and revealed the Throckmorton Plot.

===Mary leaves Sheffield===
In August 1584 Queen Elizabeth finally agreed to Earl George&#x27;s petition releasing him from his duty of Mary&#x27;s care. The task which had broken his marriage, his health and his chances of further political advancement. After leaving Sheffield, Mary was taken to Wingfield Manor in Derbyshire by her new gaolers, Sir Ralph Sadler and John Somers, and then to Tutbury. From there she went to Chartley Manor in Staffordshire, where she became involved in the Babington Plot.

==Earl of Shrewsbury==
Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury and his wife Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury stayed at Sheffield Lodge. He wrote in December 1604 that they had, &quot;no other music this Christmas than the waits of the next town, besides a taber and a whistle&quot;. The Earl had gout and wrote in September 1607 that he was laid up on a couch at Sheffield Lodge, &quot;neither fit for football nor tennis&quot;.

==Duke of Norfolk==
After Sheffield Manor fell into the hands of the Duke of Norfolk, it was neglected, sold to tenant farmers, and largely dismantled in 1706. Some remaining walls and a window were removed to the grounds of Queen&#x27;s Tower in Norfolk Park by Robert Marnock in 1839. In 1953 the Duke of Norfolk Estate leased the site to Sheffield City Council for 999 years.

==&quot;Restoration&quot; plan==
In 2004, the building featured on the BBC TV programme &quot;Restoration&quot; and was the subject of a National Lottery funding bid to convert it to a heritage centre and traditional farm. Green Estate, which was established by the Manor and Castle Development Trust and Sheffield Wildlife Trust, received £1.25 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund to restore the Turret House and develop the site as a visitor attraction.

== Visitor attraction ==
The Sheffield Manor Lodge visitor attraction includes the Turret house, Tudor grounds, Discovery Centre, and Rhubarb Shed Cafe. The Turret House is open to the public every Sunday between April and September, in Sheffield school holidays and on special event days.

<doc id="319178" wikidata="Q1478622" url="?curid=319178" title="Pennine Way">
<text>The Pennine Way is a National Trail in England, with a small section in Scotland. The trail stretches for from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park and ends at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The path runs along the Pennine hills, sometimes described as the &quot;backbone of England&quot;. Although not the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest National Trail, it is, according to The Ramblers, &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s best known and toughest&quot;.

==History==

The path was the idea of the journalist and rambler Tom Stephenson, inspired by similar trails in the United States, particularly the Appalachian Trail. Stephenson proposed the concept in an article for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in 1935, and lobbied Parliament for the creation of an official trail. The walk was planned to end at Wooler but it was decided that Kirk Yetholm would be the finishing point. The final section was declared open in a ceremony held on Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. Before the official opening of the Pennine Way the British Army was invited to test the route, a task that was accomplished in one day. Junior soldiers from the Junior Tradesman&#x27;s Regiment of the Army Catering Corps, based in Aldershot, were split into patrols of four or five and each was allocated an approximately section of the walk. A report was then provided on the signage and route feasibility.

The Pennine Way celebrated its 50th anniversary in April 2015. A special four-part BBC One series &quot;The Pennine Way&quot; was broadcast throughout April.

==Usage==

The Pennine Way is popular with walkers, and in 1990 the Countryside Commission reported that 12,000 long-distance walkers and 250,000 day-walkers were using all or part of the trail annually and that walkers contributed £2 million (1990) to the local economy along the route, directly maintaining 156 jobs. The popularity of the walk has resulted in substantial erosion to the terrain in places, and steps have been taken to recover its condition, including diverting sections of the path onto firmer ground, and laying flagstones or duckboards in softer areas. The actions have been effective in reducing the extent of broken ground, though the intrusion into the natural landscape has at times been controversial.

Accommodation is available at youth hostels, camp sites, bed-and-breakfasts and pubs, but is limited on upland stretches, so when planning the walk one must sometimes choose between a long day (between two places offering on-route accommodation) or two shorter days involving an evening descent off-route (to a nearby village or farm) with a morning re-ascent.

There are 535 access points where the Pennine Way intersects with other public rights of way. The route is crossed by many roads and passes through many villages and towns with good public transport. This makes it easy to sample a short section of the trail, or to split the Pennine Way across several holidays or long weekends.

Most of the Pennine Way is on public footpaths, rather than bridleways, and not accessible to travellers on horseback or bicycle, but a roughly parallel Pennine Bridleway is open from Derbyshire to Cumbria. This route, open to anyone not using motorised vehicles, starts slightly farther south than the Pennine Way.

==Route==

A survey by the National Trails agency reported that a walker covering the entire length of the trail is obliged to navigate 287 gates, 249 timber stiles, 183 stone stiles and 204 bridges. of the route is on public footpaths, on public bridleways and on other public highways. The walker is aided by the provision of 458 waymarks.

===Peak District National Park===

The Pennine Way originally climbed north from Edale across the middle of the Kinder Scout plateau. It was rerouted to reduce erosion, and now heads west to climb onto the plateau by steps known as Jacob&#x27;s Ladder. It then turns north to follow the western edge of the plateau past Kinder Downfall, crosses the Snake Pass road (A57) and climbs Bleaklow. From the summit the trail descends to Longdendale. In the dale it crosses the dam of Torside Reservoir to Crowden, the first village since the start of the trail away.

From Crowden the Pennine Way climbs a side valley past Laddow Rocks to the summit of Black Hill on the border of Yorkshire. It descends across Wessenden Head Moor (the eastern part of Saddleworth Moor) and the A635 road to the Wessenden Valley. It climbs out of the valley to leave the National Park at Standedge on the A62 road.

===South Pennines===

From Standedge the Pennine Way follows the Yorkshire–Greater Manchester border north along a series of gritstone edges. It crosses the A640 road, then the A672, before crossing the M62 motorway by a long footbridge near Windy Hill. Past the motorway the trail follows Blackstone Edge to the A58 road, then passes a series of reservoirs. It crosses the Calderdale Way high above the village of Mankinholes, then climbs to the prominent monument on Stoodley Pike. From the monument it descends steeply to the valley of the River Calder, which it crosses about west of the town of Hebden Bridge, the largest settlement near the route.

The trail climbs out of the Calder valley through the scattered hamlet of Colden, crossing Colden Water by an ancient clapper bridge. It then passes the Walshaw Dean Reservoirs and climbs to the ruins of Top Withens, said to have been the inspiration for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. The trail then descends to Ponden Hall, and crosses more moorland to the villages of Cowling and Lothersdale.

From Lothersdale the trail crosses Pinhaw Beacon to Thornton-in-Craven. There then follows gentler country, including a short section of the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at East Marton, to reach the village of Gargrave in Airedale, on the busy A65.

===Yorkshire Dales National Park===

North of Gargrave the Pennine Way ascends Airedale and enters the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It follows field paths, through the small villages of Airton and Hanlith to the larger village of Malham. It then climbs steps on the west side of Malham Cove, traverses the limestone pavement at the top of the cove, and continues north to Malham Tarn. The trail then crosses a shoulder of Fountains Fell, crosses the head of Silverdale and ascends the nose of Pen-y-Ghent in a very steep section. From the summit of Pen-y-Ghent the Pennine Way descends to the village of Horton in Ribblesdale (on the Settle–Carlisle Railway).

The Pennine Way then heads up Ribblesdale along the old Settle–Langstrothdale packhorse road. It passes the eastern end of Ling Gill and climbs Cam Fell, where it follows the line of a Roman road, shared with the Dales Way. The trail then passes Dodd Fell Hill and follows a ridge between Widdale and Sleddale, before descending into Wensleydale at Gayle and the adjoining town of Hawes.

The path crosses the dale to Hardraw, then begins the ascent of Great Shunner Fell. From the summit of the fell the trail descends to upper Swaledale and the village of Thwaite. It then crosses the side of Kisdon, with good views down Swaledale, passes Kisdon Force, a waterfall on the River Swale, and reaches the village of Keld.

From Keld the path crosses the route of the Coast to Coast Walk, then ascends a side valley known as Stones Dale to reach Tan Hill and its isolated inn at the northern boundary of the National Park.

===North Pennines===

At Tan Hill the Pennine Way enters the North Pennines AONB and follows moorland tracks to the isolated settlement of Sleightholme, where the route divides. The main route heads directly north across the moors, crossing God&#x27;s Bridge and passing beneath the A66 road in a tunnel. The alternative route enters the town of Bowes and rejoins the main route at Baldersdale. From Baldersdale the trail crosses Lunedale and descends to the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale.

From Middleton the path ascends Teesdale on the right bank of the River Tees, below the village of Holwick. It passes the waterfalls of Low Force and High Force, and reaches the scattered settlement of Forest-in-Teesdale. Further up the Tees, the path climbs beside the waterfall of Cauldron Snout below the dam of Cow Green Reservoir. The trail then ascends the gently rising side valley of Maize Beck to reach High Cup Gill, one of the most photographed areas on the Pennine Way. From High Cup the trail descends to the village of Dufton.

From Dufton the Pennine Way climbs back up the fells, passing in turn the summits of Knock Fell, Great Dun Fell, Little Dun Fell and finally Cross Fell, at the highest point on the entire path. Here, walkers can face tricky conditions in bad weather as a result of the Helm Wind which sweeps down the south-west slope of the escarpment. A long descent follows to the valley of the South Tyne at Garrigill. The trail then keeps close to the river to enter the town of Alston.

The trail continues down the valley of the South Tyne, past the Roman fort of Whitley Castle, to Slaggyford and Knarsdale. Above the village of Lambley the trail leaves the valley to cross more moorland to the A69 near the village of Greenhead.

===Northumberland National Park and the Scottish border===

Outside Greenhead the Pennine Way passes Thirlwall Castle on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. For the next the route coincides with the Hadrian&#x27;s Wall Path, following the wall closely past Once Brewed to Rapishaw Gap, west of the Housesteads Roman Fort.

From the wall the trail heads north through Wark Forest. Past the forest it follows field paths to Shitlington Crags and descends to the large village of Bellingham. More remote country follows, across Padon Hill and the edge of Redesdale Forest. The trail eventually reaches Redesdale at Blakehopeburnhaugh and Cottonshopeburnfoot, two neighbouring hamlets which compete for the longest name in England. The route then follows the River Rede upstream to the village of Byrness.

The last stage of the Pennine Way, across the Cheviot Hills from Byrness to Kirk Yetholm, is long, with no habitation en route. It is usually tackled in one long day, although there are two refuge huts (or bothies). The trail climbs steeply from the village, then heads north to cross the Scottish border near Ogre Hill. For the rest of the stage the path switches between England and Scotland, along a fence which marks the border itself. Back in England the trail passes the Roman fort at Chew Green, and briefly follows the Roman road of Dere Street. The path then follows the border ridge, passing the high point of Windy Gyle. At the west top of Cairn Hill (), from where the path leads to the summit of The Cheviot and back down, the path turns sharply northwest with the border fence, descending to a refuge hut before climbing The Schil at , above the College Valley. The path then descends into Scotland and enters the village of Kirk Yetholm. The path ends at the Border Hotel.

==Records==
The record time for completion of the Pennine Way is 2 days, 10 hours, 4 minutes and 53 seconds, set by John Kelly on 15–17 May 2021. Kelly had previously held the record for just one week in July 2020 with a time of 2 days, 16 hours and 46 minutes, before this was broken by Damian Hall with a time of 2 days, 13 hours and 35 minutes. Before this, the record had been held for 31 years by Mike Hartley (time of 2 days, 17 hours and 20 minutes).

In 1984, after many attempts, Mike Cudahy became the first person to go under 3 days. He completed the route in 2 days, 21 hours, 54 minutes and 30 seconds. His journey is well-documented in his book, &#x27;Wild Trails to Far Horizons&#x27;.

The fastest women&#x27;s time is 3 days and 46 minutes, set by Anna Troup on 14–17 August 2021. The previous record of 3 days, 2 hours and 28 minutes was set by Sabrina Verjee on 12–15 September 2020.

The route of the Pennine Way is the basis of the Spine Race, which was inaugurated in 2012.

== Further reading ==
The Pennine Way has attracted a number of writers over the years, including Tom Stephenson, who wrote the first official guidebook. A popular guide was written and illustrated by the writer Alfred Wainwright, whose offer to buy a half-pint of beer for anyone who finished the Pennine Way is estimated to have cost him up to £15,000 by his death in 1991. The National Trail Guide contains a description of the route, GPS waypoints and 1:25000 maps of the entire walk.
Barry Pilton&#x27;s book &quot;One Man and His Bog&quot; gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding. Mark Wallington&#x27;s book &quot;Pennine Walkies&quot; (in which the author is accompanied by his dog) is another humorous personal story of the walk, as is &quot;Walking Home&quot; by Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage, who walked north-to-south along the Pennine Way without money, relying on his &#x27;earnings&#x27; from nightly poetry readings along the way. Movement artists Tamara Ashley and Simone Kenyon performed the entire length of the trail in August 2006; their book documents the performance and invites readers to create their own interpretations of the landscapes along the way.

<text>Lone Tree is a community in eastern Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, United States, approximately seven and one-half miles from Morris, traveling east on U.S. Route 62, then south on N4080 Rd. It was named for a &quot;lone tree&quot; sitting on the skyline of a mountain. Lone Tree Church is also located in this area near the so-called High Spring Mountains.

Lone Tree is the birthplace of Anita Hill, notable for accusing Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his confirmation hearings in 1991.

<text>The Red Line is a rapid transit line operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) as part of the MBTA subway system. The line runs south and east underground from Alewife station in North Cambridge through Somerville and Cambridge, surfacing to cross the Longfellow Bridge then returning to tunnels under Downtown Boston. It continues underground through South Boston, splitting into two branches on the surface at JFK/UMass station. The Ashmont branch runs southwest through Dorchester to Ashmont station, where the connecting light rail Mattapan Line (shown as part of the Red Line on maps, but operated separately) continues to Mattapan station. The Braintree branch runs southeast through Quincy and Braintree to Braintree station.

The Red Line operates during normal MBTA service hours (all times except late nights) with six-car trains. The 218-car active fleet consists of three orders of cars built in 1969–70, 1987–89, and 1993–94. A 252-car order from CRRC is being built from 2019 to 2024. The Red Line is fully grade-separated; trains are driven by operators with automatic train control for safety. Cabot Yard in South Boston is used for heavy maintenance and storage; yards at Alewife, Ashmont, and Braintree are also used for storage. All 22 Red Line stations are fully accessible. Averaging 119,000 weekday passengers in 2023, the Red Line has the highest ridership of the MBTA subway lines.

The Boston Elevated Railway opened its Cambridge tunnel between and in 1912. It was extended south as the Dorchester Tunnel to Washington (now ) in 1915, in 1916, in 1917, and in 1918. The Dorchester extension added three stops to in 1927 and two more stops to Ashmont in 1928. Charles (now ) was added as an infill station in 1932. The newly formed MBTA assigned colors to its subway lines in 1965, with the Cambridge–Dorchester line becoming the Red Line. The MBTA added the three-station South Shore Line to in 1971; it was extended to Braintree in 1980, with added as an infill in 1983. The Red Line Northwest Extension, originally planned to run to Arlington Heights or Route 128, opened to in 1984 and Alewife in 1985.

==History==

===Cambridge tunnel===
The Red Line was the last of the four original Boston subway lines (the others being the Green, Orange, and Blue Lines, opened in 1897, 1901, and 1904, respectively) to be constructed.

Construction of the Cambridge tunnel, connecting Harvard Square to Boston, was delayed by a dispute over the number of intermediate stations to be built along the new line. Cambridge residents, led by Mayor Wardwell, wanted at least five stations built along the line, while suburbanites interested in faster through travel argued for only a single intermediate station, at Central Square. The contending groups finally compromised on two intermediate stations, at Central and Kendall Squares, allowing construction to start in 1909.

The section from Harvard (and new maintenance facilities at Eliot Yard) to Park Street was opened by the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) on March 23, 1912. At Harvard, a prepayment station provided easy transfer to streetcars routed through what is now the Harvard bus tunnel. From Harvard, the Cambridge tunnel traveled beneath Massachusetts Avenue to Central Square station. It then continued under Mass. Ave until Main Street, which it followed to reach Kendall station. The underground line then rose onto the Longfellow Bridge, using a central right-of-way which had been reserved during the bridge&#x27;s 1900–1906 construction. On the Boston side, the line briefly became an elevated railway, as vehicle lanes descended beneath it to Charles Circle; the tracks then immediately entered a tunnel beneath Beacon Hill, leading to new lower-level platforms at Park Street Under. Charles Station (now Charles/MGH) was added above the traffic circle in 1932.

===Dorchester Tunnel and extension===

The Dorchester Tunnel to Washington Street and South Station Under opened on April 4, 1915 and December 3, 1916, with transfers to the Washington Street Tunnel and Atlantic Avenue Elevated, respectively. Further extensions opened to Broadway on December 15, 1917 and Andrew on June 29, 1918, both prepayment stations for streetcar transfer. The Broadway station included an upper level with its own tunnel for streetcars, which was soon abandoned in 1919 due to most lines being truncated to Andrew. The upper level at Broadway was later incorporated into the mezzanine.

Next came the Dorchester extension (now the Ashmont branch), following a rail right-of-way created in 1870 by the Shawmut Branch Railroad. In 1872, the right-of-way was acquired by the Old Colony Railroad to connect their main line at Harrison Square with the Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad, running from the Old Colony at Neponset, west to what is now Mattapan station. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad succeeded the Old Colony in operating the branch, but passenger service ceased on September 4, 1926, in anticipation of the construction of the BERy&#x27;s Dorchester extension.

The BERy opened the first phase of the Dorchester extension, to Fields Corner station, on November 5, 1927, south from Andrew, then southeast to the surface and along the west side of the Old Colony mainline in a depressed right-of-way. Columbia and Savin Hill stations were built on the surface at the sites of former Old Colony stations. The remainder of the extension opened to Ashmont and Codman Yard on September 1, 1928, and included Shawmut station, where there had been a surface Old Colony station, but where the new rapid transit station was placed underground. The first phase of the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line opened on August 26, 1929, using the rest of the Shawmut Branch right-of-way, including Cedar Grove station, and part of the old Dorchester and Milton Branch.

On January 13, 1961, the MTA began operating &quot;modified express service&quot; on the line during the morning rush hour, following the introduction of similar service on the Forest Hills–Everett line the month before. Every other train bypassed Shawmut, Savin Hill, Columbia, and Charles stations. This was discontinued in September 1961 to reduce wait times at the skipped stations, most of which were outdoors.

Charles was renamed Charles/MGH in December 1973, and Kendall was renamed Kendall/MIT on August 7, 1978. In January 1981, the MBTA proposed to close the Ashmont branch on Sundays – and the Mattapan Line at all times – beginning that March due to severe budget issues. The closure was cancelled, though the lines were closed from June 20, 1981, to January 16, 1982, for track replacement and tunnel repairs.

===MBTA era and branding===
The line was sometimes referred to as the Cambridge–Dorchester line and the Cambridge–Dorchester subway. It was marked on maps as &quot;Route 1&quot;. After taking over operations in August 1964, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston&#x27;s public transportation network. Colors were assigned to the rail lines on August 26, 1965 as part of a wider modernization developed by Cambridge Seven Associates, with the Cambridge–Dorchester line becoming the Red Line. Peter Chermayeff claims to have assigned red to the line because of Harvard&#x27;s association with crimson.
===South Shore line===
On July 28, 1965, the MBTA signed an agreement with the New Haven Railroad to purchase of the former Old Colony mainline from Fort Point Channel to South Braintree in order to construct a new rapid transit line along the corridor. The line was expected to be completed within two years. The agreement also provided for the MBTA to subsidize commuter service on the railroad&#x27;s remaining commuter rail lines for $1.2 million annually. Original plans called for the South Shore line to be largely independent of the existing Red Line, with either a northern terminus at the surface level at South Station or a tunnel leading to a stub-end terminal between Post Office Square and State Street. However, it was later decided to have the line be a new southern branch of the Red Line.

The first section of the South Shore line, under construction since 1966, opened on September 1, 1971, branching from the original Red Line at a flying junction north of Columbia (now JFK/UMass). It ran along the west side of the Old Colony rail right-of-way (which has since been reduced to one track), crossing to the east side north of Savin Hill. The northernmost station was North Quincy, with others at Wollaston and Quincy Center. Service began alternating between Ashmont and Quincy. Ashmont service operated with 1400-series cars, while the Quincy branch only had 1500- and 1600-series cars because they had cab signaling.

In December 1969, the MBTA purchased Penn Central&#x27;s Dover Street Yards for $7 million. The site was used for the South Bay Maintenance Center (later Cabot Yard), which included Red Line shops (to replace Eliot Yard) and an adjacent bus garage. A $7.8 million construction contract was awarded in 1972, with groundbreaking on September 16. The facility was dedicated on June 24, 1974; on December 28, Bartlett Street garage in Roxbury was closed.

Three southbound trains collided inside the Beacon Hill tunnel on August 1, 1975, injuring 132 passengers.

====Braintree extension====

Beyond Quincy Center, the Braintree extension runs southward to Braintree, opened on March 22, 1980, via an intermediate stop at Quincy Adams which opened on September 10, 1983 due to delays. The extension was part of the massive 1965 extension plan, although it was delayed due to questions over station siting in Braintree. The Boston Transportation Planning Review, published in 1969, proposed North Braintree and South Braintree stations following the Quincy Center station.

Several outlying sections of the MBTA subway system, including Quincy Adams and Braintree, originally charged a double fare to account for the additional costs of running service far from downtown. Passengers paid two fares to enter at the stations, and an exit fare when leaving the station. Double fares on the Braintree extension, the last on the system, were discontinued in 2007 as part of a wider fare restructuring.

===Northwest extension===

By 1922, the BERy believed that Harvard would be the permanent terminus; the heavy ridership from the north was expected to be handled by extending rapid transit from Lechmere Square. The 1926 &quot;Report on Improved Transportation Facilities in the Boston Metropolitan District&quot; proposed an extension from Lechmere to North Cambridge via the Southern Division and the Fitchburg Cutoff, with a possible further extension along the Lexington Branch. An extension of the Cambridge–Dorchester Line under Mount Auburn Street to Watertown, and thence along the Watertown Branch to Waltham, was also raised as a possibility. A northwards extension from Harvard to the North Cambridge/Arlington border was proposed by Cambridge mayor John D. Lynch in 1933 and by then-freshmen state representative Tip O&#x27;Neill in 1936, but was not pursued.

The 1945 Coolidge Commission report – the first major transit planning initiative in the region since 1926 – recommended an extension from Harvard to Arlington Heights via East Watertown. The 1947 revision recommended an extension north to Porter Square instead, with branches along the Fitchburg Division to Waltham and the Lexington Branch to Lexington. The 1966 &quot;Program for Mass Transportation&quot; by the 1964-created MBTA called for an immediate extension to Alewife Brook Parkway via Porter Square, with possible future extensions to Arlington or Waltham. Original plans called for a subway under Massachusetts Avenue to Porter Square, then a surface route along the Fitchburg Route to Alewife. In the late 1960s, the project was expanded to follow the Lexington Branch to a terminal at Route 128.

In 1970, Cambridge began advocating for the project, and for the consideration of an all-subway route under Garden Street. That October, then-governor Francis Sargent suspended most highway construction inside Route 128 and created the Boston Transportation Planning Review, which focused on the implementation of new transit routes. In 1972, a new all-subway route via Porter Square and Davis Square was considered (and ultimately chosen). By the mid-1970s, the project was split into two phases: an all-subway extension to Arlington Heights via Alewife, with a later extension to Route 128.

Arlington did not wish for Arlington Heights to be even a temporary terminal. In March 1977, Arlington voters rejected the project in a nonbinding referendum, citing fears of increased taxes and congestion. A May 1977 state bill prohibiting extension into Arlington was vetoed by then-governor Michael Dukakis. The Environmental Impact Statement, released in August 1977, primarily evaluated the Arlington Heights terminus but also provided for a shorter Alewife extension. By the time the northwest extension began construction in 1978, opposition in Arlington and reductions in federal funding had caused the MBTA to choose the shorter Alewife alternative.

The Red Line was extended temporarily to Harvard–Brattle over former yard and storage tracks on March 24, 1979. This allowed for bus transfers to be provided. The Harvard bus tunnel was closed temporarily at the time. On January 31, 1981, the original Harvard station was permanently closed, as its demolition was required. To replace it, a temporary station at Harvard–Holyoke was built across the tracks. The two temporary stations were closed on September 2, 1983 in preparation for the opening of the new Harvard station. On September 6, 1983, the new station at Harvard opened, with trains changing direction at Davis Square without carrying passengers. Eliot Yard was demolished; Harvard Kennedy School now sits inside its retaining walls.

The line was extended to Davis with a station at Porter on December 8, 1984. The line was extended to its current terminus at Alewife on March 30, 1985. At the time, all off-peak trains terminated there, but due to the incomplete construction of a yard at Alewife, only Ashmont trains ran to Alewife during rush hours. Davis was the terminal for rush hour Braintree trains. These trains were finally extended to Alewife during rush hours on December 26, 1985, with the completion of the yard at Alewife. During the expansion, the MBTA pioneered an investment in the &quot;Arts on the Line&quot; public art program. Fill from the tunnel excavation was used to create Danehy Park on the former site of the Cambridge City Dump, and to restore Russell Field in Cambridge and Magnolia Park in Arlington.

===Station renovations===

A 1979 renovation of added two elevators, making it the first accessible station on the Red Line. In the early 1980s, the MBTA began extending platforms for six-car trains: and in 1981, in 1982, and and in the mid-1980s. (The Northwest and South Shore extensions had been built for longer trains, while had been modified in 1970.) In the mid-1980s, the MBTA spent $80 million to extend the platforms of seven underground Red Line stations (, , Park Street, Washington, , , and ) and three Orange Line stations. Six-car trains entered service on January 21, 1988.

Central, Kendall/MIT, Park Street, and Downtown Crossing (renamed from Washington in 1987) were completed in 1988. A major reconstruction of JFK/UMass added a platform for the Braintree branch, which opened on December 14, 1988. Renovations to Broadway were completed in October 1989. and were accessible by 1989, if not from their original construction. South Station was completed around 1992, followed by Andrew in 1994.

The 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act spurred the renovation of additional stations. was modified in 1991, followed by in 1998. Charles/MGH was rebuilt from 2003 to 2007. The agency began design for the four Ashmont branch stations in 2001. Savin Hill was closed from May 2004 to July 31, 2005 for reconstruction. It was followed by the completion of the rebuilt Fields Corner station in 2008, the modified Shawmut in 2009, and the rebuilt Ashmont in 2011. The final Red Line station to be modified for accessibility was , which was closed from January 2018 to August 2019 for a complete reconstruction.
===2010s and 2020s===
 A $255 million project, which started in Spring 2013, replaced structural elements of the Longfellow Bridge, which carries the line across the Charles River between the Charles/MGH and Kendall/MIT stations. The project required at least 25 weekend shutdowns, including temporary relocation of the tracks and a substitute bus shuttle service. All outbound roadway traffic was detoured from the bridge for the three years of construction. The bridge finished construction in May 2018.
During the unusually frigid and snowy winter of 2014–15, almost the entire MBTA rail system was shut down on several occasions by heavy snowfalls. The aboveground sections of the Orange and Red lines were particularly vulnerable due to their exposed third rail power feed, which iced over during storms. If a single train were stopped due to power loss, other trains behind it soon had to stop as well; without continually running trains pushing snow off the rails, the lines would become quickly blocked by heavy snowfalls. (Because the Blue Line was built with overhead catenary on its surface section due to its exposure to corrosive salt air, it was not as easily disabled by the icing conditions.)

During 2015, the MBTA implemented its $83.7 million Winter Resiliency Program, much of which focused on preventing similar vulnerabilities with the Orange and Red lines. The section of the Braintree branch between JFK/UMass and Wollaston had old infrastructure and was largely built on an embankment, rendering it more vulnerable. New third rail with heaters and a different metal composition to reduce wear was installed, along with snow fences and switch heaters. The work required bustitution of the line from JFK/UMass to North Quincy on many weeknights. This program did not include work south of Wollaston.

In July 2016, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board approved a $18.5 million contract to complete work along the remainder of the southern branches. The project included all remaining third rail replacement, track work between Fields Corner and Savin Hill, signal system work between North Quincy and Braintree, and track replacement at Quincy Center, Quincy Adams, and Braintree. The work was completed in the second half of 2016.

On December 10, 2015, a Red Line train in revenue service traveled from to without an operator in the cab before it was stopped by cutting power to the third rail. The MBTA initially said that the train appeared to have been tampered with and the incident was not an accident, but later determined operator error to have been the cause.

On February 21, 2018, a Red Line train motor failed on approach to Andrew station causing the train to derail. On June 11, 2019, a Red Line train derailed just north of JFK/UMass station, damaging three sheds of signal equipment that control the complex interlockings around the station. The Red Line was limited to 10 trains per hour (instead of the usual 13-14) for several months while repairs were made. The derailment was caused by a broken axle, which had been made brittle by sparks from a faulty grounding component on a motor. Full service resumed on September 25, 2019.

Speed restrictions were placed on much of the MBTA subway system in March 2023 due to deteriorated track conditions. Portions of the line were shut down for several periods in 2023–2024 to allow for track work to remove the speed restrictions. A shutdown of the Braintree branch from September 6–29, 2024, was intended to &quot;lay the groundwork&quot; for a future speed increase as well as removing speed restrictions. The branch had been restricted to for several decades, but the MBTA intended to eventually increase some portions to . This would save up to 3 minutes per round trip. , the increase was expected to occur within several days.

== Operations and signaling ==

, both branches were scheduled to operate on 12–13-minute headways during weekday peak hours (with a combined 6-minute headway between Alewife and JFK/UMass) and 12 to 16 minute headways at other times. Fleet utilization ranged from 16 trains (96 cars) on weekends to 20 trains (120 cars) at peak hours. However, rolling stock availability and longer trip times due to slow zones reduced service. By July 2023, headways were 18 minutes on each branch on weekdays and every 22 minutes on weekends. This was improved to 14–16 minute weekday headways and 20–22 minute weekend headways on August 27, 2023.

The Ashmont and Harvard branches were both built with automatic block signaling and trip-stop train protection, while the Braintree and Alewife extensions of the 1980s were constructed with Automatic Train Control (ATC) using audio frequency cab signaling. In 1985 the entire Red Line was converted to the new cab signal standard with any remaining interlocking towers being closed with a relay based centralized traffic control machine being installed in a dispatch office at 45 High Street. This in turn was replaced in the late 1990s with a software-controlled Automatic Train Supervision product by Union Switch &amp; Signal, subcontracted to Syseca Inc. (now ARINC), in a new control room. Subsequent revisions to the system were made internally at the MBTA.

Scheduled headways were as low as 2 minutes after the 1928 extension to Ashmont. When Stadium station was in use for Harvard football games, headways as low as 1 minutes were used. Ridership peaked around 1947, when passenger counters logged over 850 people per four-car train during peak periods. After the conversion to ATC, throughput in the downtown corridor was 13 trains per hour or a little less than 5 minute headway which gives a maximum capacity of 20,280 passengers per hour.

In October 2018, the MBTA awarded a $218 million improved signal contract for the Red and Orange Lines, which will allow 3-minute headways between JFK/UMass and Alewife beginning in 2022. The decreased headway will be achieved through increased vehicle performance, an upgrade of the existing ATC system to use higher performance digital components and a reduction in the length of signaling blocks to 500 feet.

During snowstorms, the MBTA runs an empty train during non-service hours to keep the tracks and third rail clear. The Red Line experienced major service disruptions in the winter of 2014–15 due to frozen-over third rails, leaving unpowered trains stranded between stations with passengers on board.

==Rolling stock==
The Red Line is standard gauge heavy rail. Trains consist of mated pairs of electric multiple unit cars powered from a 600 V DC third rail. All trains run in six-car sets. All cars are roughly long, wide, and have a platform height of above the top of rail.

Rolling stock is maintained at the Cabot Yard in South Boston. Yard leads connect to the mainline at Columbia Junction, just north of JFK/UMass station. Trains are also stored at Braintree (Caddigan Yard), Ashmont (Codman Yard), and Alewife. Eliot Yard, on the surface near Harvard Square, served East Boston Tunnel cars for a short time and Red Line cars until it was demolished in the 1970s. (East Boston Tunnel cars accessed the yard through the now-closed Joy Street portal near Bowdoin station and a track connection on the Longfellow Bridge).

===1912 Cambridge subway and 1928 Dorchester cars===

The Cambridge subway began service in 1912 with 40 all-steel motor cars built by the Standard Steel Car Company, and 20 cars from the Laconia Car Company. They had a novel design as a result of studies about Boston&#x27;s existing lines, with a then-extraordinary length of over buffers, and a large standee capacity, while weighing only . They had an all-new door arrangement: three single sliding doors per side evenly distributed along the car&#x27;s length so that the maximum distance to a door was around . Upon their debut, the new subway cars were the largest in the world; they remained so until the Toronto M1 cars were built in 1962. A similar configuration was later adopted by the BMT&#x27;s Standard cars in New York and the Broad Street Subway cars in Philadelphia.

About of the Boston car was separated by a bulkhead for a smoking compartment. In contrast to the elevated lines, passenger flowthrough was not intended, and every door was used as both entrance and exit. Thirty-five cars of similar design were added in 1919 from the Pressed Steel Car Company, followed by 60 more in 1928 from the Bradley Car Company for the Cambridge–Dorchester subway.

=== 1963 Pullman cars ===

The 1912–1928 Cambridge–Dorchester fleet remained in service until 1963, when it was replaced all at once by 92 married-pair cars from Pullman-Standard numbered 01400–01491. These carbon-steel cars were originally delivered in a blue, white and gold paint scheme (the state colors of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which funded their purchase), and retained that color scheme into the early 1980s when most were finally repainted into Red Line colors for the opening of the Alewife Extension. The 01400s (or 1400s) were the last pre-MBTA transit cars and also the last ones built without air conditioning. With delivery of the 1800-series, all cars were retired from passenger service by 1994 due to mechanical and electrical equipment not being able to operate with six-car trains.

Cars 01450 and 01455 were sent to the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine for preservation. Four other cars - 01470/01471 and 01480/01481 - remained as Red Line work equipment, but were sidelined after some time and are awaiting disposal.

===Aluminum-bodied cars===

Three series of older aluminum-bodied cars were built: the 1500 and 1600 series by Pullman-Standard 1969–1970 (known as the &quot;No. 1&quot; fleet), and 1700–57 by UTDC in 1988 (&quot;No. 2&quot; fleet). These cars seat 62 to 64 each and approximately 132 cars are in active service , including some of the oldest cars still in regular revenue service on the MBTA system. All cars are painted white with red trim, with manually operated exterior roll signs. Before their overhauls, the 1500 and 1600 series had a brushed aluminum livery with a thin red stripe and were usually called &quot;Silverbird&quot; cars from their natural metal finish.

All these cars use traditional DC traction motors with electromechanical controls manufactured by Westinghouse and can interoperate. The 1500 and 1700 series cars could operate as singles, but in practice are always operated as married pairs. The 1600 series could only operate as married pairs. Originally, the 1500s were double-ended and had two cabs, but were converted to single ended during their midlife overhaul. Headlights are still present on the non-cab ends on the 1500s. The 1700s also have headlights on their non-cab end, but they were built with only one cab.

===Stainless steel–bodied cars===

The 1800–85 series of stainless steel–bodied cars was built in 1993–94 by Bombardier from components manufactured in Canada and assembled in Barre, Vermont. (This is known as the &quot;No. 3&quot; fleet.) These cars seat 50, and all 86 cars are in active service. An automated stop announcement system provides station announcements synchronized with visual announcements in red LED signs ceiling-mounted in each car. These cars are stainless steel with red trim, and use yellow LCD exterior signs. These cars originally had red cloth seats (in contrast to the black leather seats of other cars), but in the early 21st century the cloth seats were replaced with black leather seats. More recently the black leather seats were replaced with vandalism-proof reinforced carpet type seats containing multi-colored patterns, as with the other Red Line stock.

They have modern AC traction motors with solid state controls manufactured by General Electric, very similar to the Breda A650 for the Los Angeles Metro Rail, the Bombardier R110B prototype for the New York City Subway, and the Washington Metro 1000 series. They can operate only as mated pairs and can partially interoperate with older cars in emergencies or non-revenue equipment moves, but not in revenue service.

In December 2008, the MBTA began running a pair of modified 1800 series cars without seats, in order to increase train capacity. The MBTA became the first transit operator in the United States with heavy rail operations to run cars modified for this purpose. These cars, set 1802–1803, have been designated as &quot;Big Red&quot; cars, denoted by large stickers adjacent to the doors. Automated service announcements at stations alert passengers to the arrival of these high-capacity trains. As of 2018, both Big Red cars have been retrofitted with seats, about half as many as the standard 01800 series cars.

Cars 01816 and 01817, out of service since 2004, were donated to the US Coast Guard in November 2021. They were relocated to Otis Air Force Base for training use.

===CRRC cars and upgraded signal system===
In October 2013, MassDOT announced plans for a $1.3 billion subway car order for the Orange and Red Lines, which would provide 74 new cars to replace the 1500/1600-series cars, with an option to increase the number to 132 to replace the 1700-series cars.

On October 22, 2014, the MassDOT Board awarded a $567 million contract to build 132 replacement railcars for the Red Line, as well as additional cars for the Orange Line to a China based manufacturer CNR (which became part of CRRC the following year). CRRC will build the new cars at a new manufacturing plant in Springfield at the site of the former New England Westinghouse Company, with initial deliveries of Red Line cars expected in 2020 (Orange Line deliveries began a year earlier) and all cars required to be in service by 2023. The Board forwent federal funding to allow the contract to specify the cars be built in Massachusetts, to create a local railcar manufacturing industry. In conjunction with the new rolling stock, the remainder of the $1.3 billion allocated for the project will pay for testing, signal improvements and expanded maintenance facilities, as well as other related expenses. Sixty percent of the car&#x27;s components are sourced from the United States. The new cars will hold 15 additional passengers, will have four wheelchair parking areas per car, and will be equipped with on-board video surveillance. The cars will have wider doors to allow faster boarding at busy stations, and can allow wheelchair access even if one of a pair of door panels fails to open. The MBTA rebuilt Track 61 to serve as a test track for the new Red Line cars.

In December 2016, the MBTA opted to purchase additional identical cars from CRRC, allowing replacement rather than costly refurbishment of the 01800 series cars. The second order is for 120 cars costing $277 million, with an option for 14 additional cars. Combined, the 2014 and 2016 orders will provide a single common fleet for the entire Red Line, with enough cars to eventually run 3-minute headways at peak. Replacement of the signal system is expected to be complete by 2021 on the Red Line; the total cost is $218 million for both the Red and Orange Lines. The first trainset of new cars entered revenue service on December 30, 2020. The cars were taken out of service on March 16, 2021 after a CRRC car on the Orange Line derailed. After investigations were completed, they returned to service in January 2022, at which point an increased number of deliveries was expected during 2022. The cars were pulled from service again in June 2022 after a battery failure; they returned in July 2022.

Production delays became apparent in 2019, and then factory shutdowns and staffing limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic delayed projected final delivery to 2024, with subsequent issues with staffing, supply chain, and delaying expected completion to summer 2025. The CRRC contract specifies a penalty of $500 per car per day of delay after September 2023; as of February 14th 2025, 36 of the red line cars have been delivered with 24 of them in service.
==Art and architecture==
The MBTA pioneered a &quot;percentage for art&quot; public art program called Arts on the Line during its Northwest Extension of the Red Line in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Arts on the Line was the first program of its kind in the United States and became the model for similar programs for art across the country.

The Kendall/MIT station features an interactive public art installation by Paul Matisse called the &quot;Kendall Band&quot;, which allows the public to activate three sound-producing machines utilizing levers on the wall of the station. Above the tracks at Alewife hangs a series of red neon tubes called &quot;The End of the Red Line&quot;, by the Boston artists Alejandro and Moira Sina. Many stations built or renovated in the past three decades now feature public art.

The MBTA maintains an online catalog of the over 90 artworks installed along its six major transit lines. Each downloadable guide is illustrated with full-color photographs, titles, artists, locations, and descriptions of individual artworks.

Newer aboveground stations (particularly Alewife, Braintree, and Quincy Adams, which all have large parking garages) are excellent examples of brutalist architecture.

<text>The Hungarian Rhapsodies, S.244, R.106 (, , ), are a set of 19 piano pieces based on Hungarian folk themes, composed by Franz Liszt during 1846–1853, and later in 1882 and 1885. Liszt also arranged versions for orchestra, piano duet and piano trio.

Some are better known than others, with Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 being particularly famous and No. 6, No. 10, No. 12, No. 14 (especially as arranged for piano and orchestra as the Hungarian Fantasy), and No.15 also being well known.

In their original piano form, the &quot;Hungarian Rhapsodies&quot; are noted for their difficulty (Liszt was a virtuoso pianist as well as a composer).

==Form==
Liszt incorporated many themes he had heard in his native western Hungary and which he believed to be folk music, though many were in fact tunes written by members of the Hungarian upper middle class, or by composers such as József Kossovits, often played by Roma (Gypsy) bands. The large scale structure of each was influenced by the verbunkos, a Hungarian dance in several parts, each with a different tempo. Within this structure, Liszt preserved the two main structural elements of typical Gypsy improvisation—the &quot;lassan&quot; (&quot;slow&quot;) and the &quot;friska&quot; (&quot;fast&quot;). At the same time, Liszt incorporated a number of effects unique to the sound of Gypsy bands, especially the pianistic equivalent of the cimbalom. He also makes much use of the Hungarian gypsy scale.

==Arranged versions==
Nos. 2, 5, 6, 9, 12, and 14 were arranged for orchestra by Franz Doppler, with revisions by Liszt himself. These orchestrations appear as S.359 in the Searle catalogue; however, the numbers given to these versions were different from their original numbers. The orchestral rhapsodies numbered 1–6 correspond to the piano solo versions numbered 14, 2, 6, 12, 5 and 9 respectively.

In 1874, Liszt also arranged the same six rhapsodies for piano duet (S.621). In 1882 he made a piano duet arrangement of No. 16 (S.622), and in 1885 a piano duet version of No. 18 (S.623) and No. 19 (S.623a). Liszt also arranged No. 12 (S.379a) and No. 9 (S.379) for piano, violin and cello.

No. 14 was also the basis of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Fantasia&quot; for piano and orchestra, S.123. 
==List of the Hungarian Rhapsodies==
The set is as follows:

The first two were published in the year 1851, nos. 3–15 in 1853, and the last four were published in 1882 and 1886.

<doc id="319186" wikidata="Q3705235" url="?curid=319186" title="Kame delta">
<text>A kame delta (or ice-contact delta, morainic delta) is a glacial landform formed by a stream of melt water flowing through or around a glacier and depositing material, known as kame (stratified sequence of sediments) deposits. Upon entering a proglacial lake at the end (terminus) of a glacier, the river/stream deposit these sediments. This landform can be observed after the glacier has melted and the delta&#x27;s asymmetrical triangular shape is visible. Once the glacier melts, the edges of the delta may subside as ice under it melts. Glacial till is deposited on the lateral sides of the delta, as the glacier melts.

== Associations ==

Kame deltas form in association with other glacial features such as kettles and eskers. Kettle lakes can form in between kame deltas. Eskers are remnants of old stream sediment flows that are exposed after the glacier has melted. These formations give indication that kame deltas formed during times of glaciation.

== Formation ==
As a river or stream empties into a proglacial lake, sediments of silt, sand, and gravel are deposited into the lake. Since these sediments are stream deposited, the stratigraphy of the beds will be well sorted. In these bed layers, sharp distinct size variations may occur in the clast size. This indicates a quick change in the river or stream&#x27;s velocity. Over time, depending on how deep the proglacial lake was and if the stream melt water was a constant, these sediments would build up and out of the lake. Sediments will then begin depositing against the terminus, or toe, of the glacier. This type of formation causes the asymmetrical triangular shaped mound, with a flat top. The longer side of the triangle, is the side that slopes down into the proglacial lake. The steeper side is the one that was up against the terminus. As the glacier retreats and the ice under the delta melts, the edges of the glacier will drop, causing a fault line to be visible on the side of the kame delta.

== Locations ==
The Fonthill Kame Delta is the highest point in the Niagara Peninsula region.

Tree River, in Nunavut, Canada.

Glacial Park, Ringwood, Illinois.

Manor () is a large low-rise housing estate in eastern Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. It is divided into &quot;Manor Park&quot;, &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower Manor&quot;, and &quot;Manor Top&quot;.

Until the 1930s, the area was mostly rural, with housing only along the main roads. The estate was started during the 1930s as a garden city type development, to alleviate overcrowding in central Sheffield. However, unlike true garden cities, places of work were not included in the scheme, although nearby Darnall and Attercliffe had some industry.

Manor is named for Sheffield Manor and is adjacent to Manor Park. Manor Top is now served by the Sheffield Supertram. Large areas of the estate were demolished, and in some cases rebuilt with private funding, from the late 1990s onwards.

===Wybourn===
Wybourn () is a council estate, built in the 1920s, lying north of Manor Park and east of Park Hill. In the north west of the district lies Hyde Park, originally a larger version of Park Hill, but since reduced in scale with the demolition of some blocks and the recladding and alteration of circulation elsewhere.

===Park Hill===

Park Hill () is the name of the district in which the Park Hill flats are sited. The name relates to the deer park attached to Sheffield Manor, the remnant of which is now known as Norfolk Park.

==In popular culture==
The Reverend and the Makers song &quot;Heavyweight Champion of the World&quot; includes the line &quot;At school he used to dream about being Bruce Lee/But the need for chops in Manor Top ain&#x27;t all that great you see&quot;.

<doc id="319195" wikidata="Q1428793" url="?curid=319195" title="Sud Aviation">
<text>Sud Aviation (, &#x27;Southern Aviation&#x27;) was a French state-owned aircraft manufacturer, originating from the merger of Sud-Est (SNCASE, or &quot;Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-est&quot;) and Sud-Ouest (SNCASO or &quot;Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du sud-ouest&quot;) on 1 March 1957. Both companies had been formed from smaller privately owned corporations that had been nationalized into six regional design and manufacturing pools just prior to the Second World War.

The company became a major manufacturer of helicopters, designing and producing several types which went on to be built in large numbers, including the Alouette II (the first production helicopter powered by a gas turbine engine; first flight in 1955), the Puma (1965) and Gazelle (1967). In 1967, an agreement between France and the United Kingdom arranged for joint production and procurement of the Puma and Gazelle, together with the British-manufactured Westland Lynx. Sud Aviation also developed the Caravelle, the first jet-powered passenger airliners for the short-medium range market.

In 1970, Sud Aviation merged with both Nord Aviation and the Société d&#x27;étude et de réalisation d&#x27;engins balistiques (SEREB) to form Aérospatiale.

==History==
Sud Aviation became an early innovator in the field of commercial jetliners. Almost two years prior to its formation, on 27 May 1955, the first prototype of the Sud Aviation Caravelle had conducted its maiden flight. The company continued the Caravelle&#x27;s flight test programme, which received its certificate of airworthiness in May 1959, and it commenced operations with the French flag carrier Air France shortly thereafter. Further orders for the type would be received from various airlines and in four years, 172 Caravelles had been sold. The Caravelle&#x27;s favourable early sales record was attributed to it having effectively no jet-powered rivals, being the only short-haul jetliner for several years following its introduction.

Several models of the Caravelle were developed, generally in response to the increasing power of available engines, which allowed progressively higher takeoff weights. By 1963, there were six versions of the Caravelle in production, designated &quot;III&quot;, &quot;VI-N&quot;, &quot;VI-R&quot;, &quot;10A&quot;, &quot;10B&quot;, and &quot;X-BIR&quot;. The final assembly line for the Caravelle was at Sud Aviation&#x27;s factory at Blagnac Airport near Toulouse. Parts of the aircraft were also manufactured at other sites across France and in other countries. Production ceased after 282 Caravelles of all types had been manufactured, including 2 prototypes or pre-production aircraft and 280 production aircraft. Sud Aviation&#x27;s break-even point had been forecast to be around the 200-unit mark.

Despite its commercial success, the Caravelle was not the focus of Sud Aviation&#x27;s development efforts during the early 1960s as the majority of the company&#x27;s design engineers were reallocated onto a successor for the Caravelle. The project ambitiously aimed at producing a supersonic transport with the same general size and range as the Caravelle. It was decided that this should be named after the firm&#x27;s recent success, thus the Super-Caravelle name was applied to the design. The French Government had requested supersonic transport designs from Sud Aviation, as well as French rival firms Nord Aviation and Dassault during the late 1950s and of the three submissions, the Super-Caravelle won the contest with a medium-range design, which was deliberately sized to avoid competition with designs assumed to already be on the drawing board.

However, in part due to the high projected cost of the project, it was decided, at the direction of both the French and British governments, to form a consortium with the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) in November 1962, merging their design and production efforts to develop a supersonic transport. Out of these combined efforts, Concorde would emerge. At first, the new consortium intended to produce long-range and short-range versions, however there was no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped to focus on the long-range airliner. The consortium received non-binding options for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day, and Pan Am, BOAC, and Air France were to be the launch customers, with six Concordes each. Other airlines in the order book included Panair do Brasil, Continental Airlines, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, American Airlines, United Airlines, Air India, Air Canada, Braniff, Singapore Airlines, Iran Air, Olympic Airways, Qantas, CAAC Airlines, Middle East Airlines, and TWA. Concorde sold very poorly due to several factors. Costs spiralled to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23 million in 1977 (equivalent to £ million in ). Its sonic boom also made supersonic travel over land unrealistic. World events, such as the 1973–74 stock market crash and the 1973 oil crisis, had made airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates; and new wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had made subsonic aircraft more efficient, presenting a low-risk option for airlines. Only Air France and British Airways (the successor company to BOAC) ultimately took up their orders for Concorde.

In the early 1960s, Sud Aviation entered the general aviation light aircraft market when it introduced the GY-80 Horizon, designed by Yves Gardan. The first GY-80 prototype flew on 21 July 1960 and 267 of the type were eventually built.

The Super Frelon was developed by Sud Aviation from the original SE.3200 Frelon. During the type&#x27;s development, Sud Aviation had risen to prominence as a major helicopter manufacturer, having exported more rotorcraft than any other European rival. Having already developed the popular Alouette II and Alouette III series, the firm was keen to establish a range of helicopters fulfilling various roles, functions, and size requirements; two of the larger models in development by the early 1960s were the Super Frelon and what would become the Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma. The Super Frelon was the largest helicopter in development by the firm, being substantially increased over the earlier Frelon, and was considered to be an ambitious design at the time. The earlier Frelon had been developed to meet the requirements of both the French Navy and the German Navy, which both had released details on its anticipated demands for a heavy helicopter; however, these requirements were revised upwards by the customer, leading to the redesign and emergence of the Super Frelon.

On 23 July 1963, a modified prototype Super Frelon helicopter was used to break the FAI absolute helicopter world speed record, having attained a maximum speed of during the flight. Flown by Jean Boulet and Roland Coffignot, a total of three international records were broken, these being: speed over 3 km at low altitude,
212.03 mph; speed at any altitude over 15 and 25 km, 217.77 mph; and 100 km closed circuit 207.71 mph. By July 1964, the French Government had placed an initial order for the Super Frelon, intended to perform logistic support duties at the Centre Experimental du Pacifique; negotiations for a further order was already being negotiated for the naval version, which were to be equipped for anti-submarine duties. However, West German support for the Super Frelon programme had already declined by this point, partially due to interest in the rival Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, which was evaluated against the type. Both civilian and military versions of the Super Frelon were built, with the military variants being the most numerous by far, entering service with the French military as well as being exported to Israel, South Africa, Libya, China and Iraq. Three military variants were produced: military transport, anti-submarine and anti-ship. The transport version is able to carry 38 equipped troops, or alternatively 15 stretchers for casualty evacuation tasks.

During 1963, Sud Aviation began work on what would become the Puma, a mid-sized helicopter, to meet a requirement of the French Army for a medium-sized all-weather helicopter capable of carrying up to 20 soldiers as well as various cargo-carrying duties. The choice was made to develop a completely new design for the helicopter with backing from the French government. The first of two Puma prototypes flew on 15 April 1965; deliveries to the French Army commenced in early 1969. The Puma was an instant success on the export market, numerous countries purchased military variants to serve in their armed forces; the type was also popularly received in the civil market, finding common usage by operators for transport duties to off-shore oil platforms. Throughout most of the 1970s, the SA 330 Puma was the best selling transport helicopter being produced in Europe. By July 1978, over 50 Pumas had already been delivered to civil customers, and the worldwide fleet had accumulated in excess of 500,000 operational hours.

Numerous nations struck deals of manufacture the Puma overseas. Romania produced it under license as the IAR 330, manufacturing at least 163 of the type for the Romanian armed forces, civil operators, and several export customers. Indonesia also undertook domestic manufacturing of the Puma. South Africa became a prolific Puma operator as well, performed their own major modification and production program conducted by the government-owned Atlas Aircraft Corporation to upgrade their own Pumas; the resulting rotorcraft was named the Oryx.

On 20 May 1965, Sud Aviation acquired the bankrupt Morane-Saulnier aircraft company from Potez, and established a new subsidiary, (GEMS), to manage its assets. In early 1966, Sud Aviation created a new subsidiary, SOCATA, to continue development and production of the Rallye family of light aircraft inherited from Morane-Saulnier. Sud Aviation soon transferred GY-80 production to SOCATA as well.

During 1966, Sud Aviation began working on a light observation helicopter as a successor to its Alouette II. The first prototype Gazelle made its maiden flight on 7 April 1967, it initially flying with a conventional tail rotor. However, this was replaced with the distinctive fenestron tail in early 1968 on the second prototype. Four Gazelle prototypes were flown, including one for British firm Westland Helicopters. On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307 km/h over 3 kilometres and 292 km/h over 100 kilometres. Early on, the Gazelle had attracted British interest, which would culminate in the issuing of a major joint development and production work share agreement between Aerospatiale and Westland. The deal, signed in February 1967, facilitated the licensed production in Britain of 292 Gazelles and 48 Pumas for the British armed forces; additionally, Westland received a 65% work share in the manufacturing of the Gazelle, becoming a joint partner for further refinements and upgrades of the type. While principally sold to military operators, a number of Gazelles for the civil market were also sold.

As part of the Anglo-French helicopter agreement signed in February 1967, Sud Aviation gained a 30 per cent share of production work in the Westland Lynx while Westland Helicopters performed the remainder of the work share. It was intended that France would procure the Lynx for its navy, along with a heavily modified armed reconnaissance variant for the French Army. However, in October 1969, the French Army cancelled its requirement for the Lynx, thus development of the specialised army variant was terminated at an early stage.

<text>Tripura () is a state in northeastern India. The third-smallest state in the country, it covers ; and the seventh-least populous state with a population of 3.67 million. It is bordered by Assam and Mizoram to the east and by Bangladesh to the north, south and west. Tripura is divided into 8 districts and 23 sub-divisions, where Agartala is the capital and the largest city in the state. Tripura has 19 different tribal communities with a majority Bengali population. Bengali, English and Kokborok are the state&#x27;s official languages.

The area of modern Tripura — ruled for several centuries by the Manikya Dynasty — was part of the Tripuri Kingdom (also known as Hill Tippera). It became a princely state under the British Raj during its tenure, and acceded to independent India in 1947. It merged with India in 1949 and was designated as a &#x27;Part C State&#x27; (union territory). It became a full-fledged state of India in 1972.

Tripura lies in a geographically isolated location in India, as only one major highway, National Highway 8, connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges — Baramura, Atharamura, Longtharai, Shakhan and Jampui Hills — run north to south, with intervening valleys; Agartala, the capital, is located on a plain to the west. The state has a tropical savanna climate, and receives seasonal heavy rains from the south west monsoon.

Forests cover more than half of the area, in which bamboo and cane tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of primate species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is hindered. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state&#x27;s gross domestic product.

According to the 2011 census, Tripura is one of the most literate states in India, with a literacy rate of 87.75%. Mainstream Indian cultural elements coexist with traditional practices of the ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites Unakoti, Pilak and Devtamura provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and indigenous religions.

==Etymology==

The name Tripura is linked to the Hindu goddess Tripura Sundari, the presiding deity of the Tripura Sundari Temple at Udaipur, one of the 51 &quot;Shakti Peethas&quot; (pilgrimage centres of &quot;Shaktism&quot;), and to the legendary tyrant king Tripur, who reigned in the region. Tripur was the 39th descendant of Druhyu, who belonged to the lineage of Yayati, a king of the Lunar Dynasty.

There are alternative theories regarding the origin of the name Tripura, such as a possible etymological reinterpretation to Sanskrit of a Tibeto-Burman (Kokborok) name. Variants of the name include &quot;Tipra&quot;, &quot;Tuipura&quot; and &quot;Tippera&quot;, which can all denote the indigenous people inhabiting the area. A Kokborok etymology from &quot;tüi&quot; (water) and &quot;pra&quot; (near) has been suggested; the boundaries of Tripura extended to the Bay of Bengal when the kings of the Tipra Kingdom held sway from the Garo Hills of Meghalaya to Arakan, the present Rakhine State of Burma; so the name may reflect vicinity to the sea.

==History==

Although there is no evidence of lower or middle Paleolithic settlements in Tripura, Upper Paleolithic tools made of fossilised wood have been found in the Haora and Khowai valleys. The Indian epic, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;; ancient religious texts, the &quot;Puranas&quot;; and the Edicts of Ashoka – stone pillar inscriptions of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka dating from the third century BC – all mention Tripura. An ancient name of Tripura (as mentioned in the Mahabharata) is &quot;Kirat Desh&quot; (English: &quot;The land of Kirat&quot;), probably referring to the Kirata Kingdoms or the more generic term Kirata. However, it is unclear whether the extent of modern Tripura is coterminous with &quot;Kirat Desh&quot;. The region was under the rule of the Twipra Kingdom for centuries, but when this dynasty began is not documented. The &quot;Rajmala&quot;, a chronicle of Tripuri kings which was first written in the 15th century, provides a list of 179 kings, from antiquity up to Krishna Kishore Manikya (1830–1850), but it is not a reliable source.
The boundaries of the kingdom changed over the centuries. At various times, the borders reached south to the jungles of the Sundarbans on the Bay of Bengal; east to Burma; and north to the boundary of the Kamarupa kingdom in Assam. There were several Muslim invasions of the region from the 13th century onward, which culminated in Mughal dominance of the plains of the kingdom in 1733, although their rule never extended to the hill regions. The Mughals had influence over the appointment of the Tripuri kings.
Tripura became a princely state during British rule in India. The kings had an estate in British India, known as &quot;Tippera district&quot; or Chakla Roshanbad (now the Comilla district of Bangladesh), in addition to the independent area known as &quot;Hill Tippera&quot;, roughly corresponding to the present-day Tripura state. Udaipur, in the south of Tripura, was the capital of the kingdom, until the king Krishna Manikya moved the capital to Old Agartala in the 18th century. It was moved to the new city of Agartala in the 19th century. Bir Chandra Manikya (1862–1896) modelled his administration on the pattern of British India, and enacted reforms including the formation of Agartala Municipal Corporation.

===Post-independence (1947–present)===
Following the independence of India in 1947, Tippera district – the estate in the plains of British India – became Comilla district of East Pakistan, and Hill Tippera remained under a regency council until 1949. The Maharani Regent of Tripura signed the Tripura Merger Agreement on 9 September 1949, making Tripura a Part C state of India. It became a Union Territory, without a legislature, in November 1956 and an elected ministry was installed in July 1963. Full statehood was conferred in 1971 by the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act, 1971. The geographic partition that coincided with the independence of India resulted in major economic and infrastructural setbacks for the state, as road transport between the state and the major cities of the newly independent India had to follow a more circuitous route, around East Pakistan. The road distance between Kolkata and Agartala before the partition was less than , and increased to , as the route now avoided East Pakistan. The geopolitical isolation was aggravated by an absence of rail transport.

After the partition of India, many Bengali Hindus migrated to Tripura as refugees fleeing religious persecution in Muslim-majority East Pakistan, especially after 1949. Settlement by Hindu Bengalis increased during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. Parts of the state were shelled by the Pakistan Army during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Following the war, the Indian government reorganised the North East region to ensure effective control of the international borders – three new states came into existence on 21 January 1972: Meghalaya, Manipur, and Tripura. Before Tripura&#x27;s merger with the Union of India, majority of the population composed of Tripuri people. Ethnic strife between the indigenous Tripuri tribe and the predominantly immigrant Bengali community led to scattered violence, and an insurgency spanning decades, including occasional massacres such as the 1980 Mandai massacre. This gradually abated following the establishment of a tribal autonomous district council and the use of strategic counter-insurgency operations. Tripura remains peaceful, as of 2016. In retaliation of the communal violence against the Hindu minority in neighbouring Bangladesh, mosques in several areas in Tripura were attacked from 19 to 26 October 2021. The influx of refugees from erstwhile East Pakistan and present day Bangladesh leads to minoritisation of the indigenous peoples of Tripura.

==Geography==

Tripura is a landlocked state in North East India, where the seven contiguous states – Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura – are collectively known as the Seven Sister States. Spread over , Tripura is the third-smallest among the 28 states in the country, behind Goa and Sikkim. It extends from 22°56&#x27;N to 24°32&#x27;N, and 91°09&#x27;E to 92°20&#x27;E. Its maximum extent measures about from north to south, and east to west. Tripura is bordered by the country of Bangladesh to the west, north and south; and the Indian states of Assam to the north east; and Mizoram to the east. It is accessible by national highways passing through the Karimganj district of Assam and Mamit district of Mizoram.

===Topography===
The physiography is characterised by hill ranges, valleys and plains. The state has five anticlinal ranges of hills running north to south, from Baramura in the west, through Atharamura, Longtharai and Shakhan, to the Jampui Hills in the east. The intervening synclines are the Agartala–Udaipur, Khowai–Teliamura, Kamalpur–Ambasa, Kailasahar–Manu and Dharmanagar–Kanchanpur valleys. At an altitude of , Betling Shib in the Jampui range is the state&#x27;s highest point. The small isolated hillocks interspersed throughout the state are known as &quot;tillas&quot;, and the narrow fertile alluvial valleys, mostly present in the west, are called &quot;Doóng/lungas&quot;. A number of rivers originate in the hills of Tripura and flow into Bangladesh. The Khowai, Dhalai, Manu, Juri and Longai flow towards the north; Sumli to the north west; the ; Gumti to the west; and the Muhuri and Feni to the south west.

The lithostratigraphy data published by the Geological Survey of India dates the rocks, on the geologic time scale, between the Oligocene epoch, approximately 34 to 23 million years ago, and the Holocene epoch, which started 12,000 years ago. The hills have red laterite soil that is porous. The flood plains and narrow valleys are overlain by alluvial soil, and those in the west and south constitute most of the agricultural land. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, on a scale ranging from in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the state lies in seismic zone V.

===Climate===
The state has a tropical savanna climate, designated &quot;Aw&quot; under the Köppen climate classification. The undulating topography leads to local variations, particularly in the hill ranges. The four main seasons are winter, from December to February; pre-monsoon or summer, from March to April; monsoon, from May to September; and post-monsoon, from October to November. During the monsoon season, the south west monsoon brings heavy rains, which cause frequent floods. The average annual rainfall between 1995 and 2006 ranged from . During winter, temperatures range from , while in the summer they fall between . According to a United Nations Development Programme report, the state lies in &quot;very high damage risk&quot; zone from wind and cyclones.

===Flora and fauna===
Like most of the Indian subcontinent, Tripura lies within the Indomalayan realm. According to the Biogeographic classification of India, the state is in the &quot;North-East&quot; biogeographic zone. In 2011 forests covered 57.73% of the state. Tripura hosts three different types of ecosystems: mountain, forest and freshwater. The evergreen forests on the hill slopes and the sandy river banks are dominated by species such as &quot;Dipterocarpus&quot;, &quot;Artocarpus&quot;, &quot;Amoora&quot;, &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot;, &quot;Syzygium&quot; and &quot;Eugenia&quot;. Two types of moist deciduous forests comprise the majority of the vegetation: moist deciduous mixed forest and Sal (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;)-predominant forest. The interspersion of bamboo and cane forests with deciduous and evergreen flora is a peculiarity of Tripura&#x27;s vegetation. Grasslands and swamps are also present, particularly in the plains. Herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees such as &quot;Albizia&quot;, &quot;Barringtonia&quot;, &quot;Lagerstroemia&quot; and &quot;Macaranga&quot; flourish in the swamps of Tripura. Shrubs and grasses include &quot;Schumannianthus dichotoma&quot; (&quot;shitalpati&quot;), &quot;Phragmites&quot; and &quot;Saccharum&quot; (sugarcane).

According to a survey in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, including such species as elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;), bear (&quot;Melursus ursinus&quot;), binturong (&quot;Arctictis binturong&quot;), wild dog (&quot;Cuon alpinus&quot;), porcupine (&quot;Artherurus assamensis&quot;), barking deer (&quot;Muntiacus muntjak&quot;), sambar (&quot;Cervus unicolor&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), leopard (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;), clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is the highest number of primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (&quot;Bubalus arnee&quot;) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.

Wildlife sanctuaries of the state are Sipahijola, Gumti, Rowa and Trishna wildlife sanctuaries. National parks of the state are Clouded Leopard National Park and Rajbari National Park. These protected areas cover a total of . Gumti is also an Important Bird Area. In winter, thousands of migratory waterfowl throng Gumti and Rudrasagar lakes.

==Administrative divisions==

In January 2012, major changes were implemented in the administrative divisions of Tripura. There had previously been four districts – Dhalai (headquarters Ambassa), North Tripura (headquarters Kailashahar), South Tripura (headquarters Udaipur, Tripura), and West Tripura (headquarters Agartala). Four new districts were carved out of the existing four in January 2012 – Khowai, Unakoti, Sipahijala and Gomati. Six new subdivisions and five new blocks were also added. Each is governed by a district collector or a district magistrate, usually appointed by the Indian Administrative Service. The subdivisions of each district are governed by a sub-divisional magistrate and each subdivision is further divided into blocks. The blocks consist of &quot;Panchayat&quot;s (village councils) and town municipalities. As of 2012, the state had eight districts, 23 subdivisions and 58 development blocks. National census and state statistical reports are not available for all the new administrative divisions, as of March 2013. Agartala, the capital of Tripura, is the most populous city. Other major towns with a population of 10,000 or more (as per 2015 census) are Sabroom, Dharmanagar, Jogendranagar, Kailashahar, Pratapgarh, Udaipur, Amarpur, Belonia, Gandhigram, Kumarghat, Khowai, Ranirbazar, Sonamura, Bishalgarh, Teliamura, Mohanpur, Melaghar, Ambassa, Kamalpur, Bishramganj, Kathaliya, Santirbazar and Baxanagar.

==Government and politics==

Tripura is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature it shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The Tripura government has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary. The Tripura Legislative Assembly consists of elected members and special office bearers that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in case of Speaker&#x27;s absence. The Assembly is unicameral with 60 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). The members are elected for a term of five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The judiciary is composed of the Tripura High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister. The Governor, the titular head of state, is appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or a coalition of parties with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the chief minister by the governor. The Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the chief minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.
Tripura sends two representatives to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament of India) and one representative to the Rajya Sabha (parliament&#x27;s upper house). In the 2019 Indian general election, both parliament lower house seats were won by the Bharatiya Janata Party. &quot;Panchayats&quot;, (local self-governments) elected by local body elections operate in many villages for self-governance. Tripura also has a unique tribal self-governance body, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council. This council is responsible for some aspects of local governance in 527 villages with high density of the scheduled tribes.

The main political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Left Front, the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress along with regional parties like the IPFT and INPT. Until 1977, the state was governed by the Indian National Congress. The Left Front was in power from 1978 to 1988, and then again from 1993 to 2018. In 1988–93, the Congress and Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti were in a ruling coalition. In the 2013 Tripura Legislative Assembly election, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly. The 2018 assembly election resulted in loss for the Left Front; the Bharatiya Janata Party won an overall majority in the state, resulting in the end of the Communist Party&#x27;s uninterrupted twenty-five year rule. The BJP won 44 out of 60 seats in the Assembly by coalition with the IPFT. The CPI (M) only got 16 seats and Indian National Congress lost by huge margins in all constituencies.

Communism in the state had its beginnings in the pre-independence era, inspired by freedom struggle activities in Bengal, and culminating in regional parties with communist leanings. It capitalised on the tribal dissatisfaction with the mainstream rulers, and has been noted for connection with the &quot;sub-national or ethnic searches for identity&quot;.

Since the 1990s, there has been an ongoing irredentist Tripura rebellion, involving militant outfits such as the National Liberation Front of Tripura and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF); terrorist incidents involving the ATTF claimed a recorded number of 389 victims in the seven-year period from 1993 to 2000. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) was first enforced in Tripura on 16 February 1997 when terrorism was at its peak in the state. The Act, as per its provisions, was subsequently reviewed and extended every six months. However, in view of the improvement in the situation and fewer terrorist activities being reported, the Tripura government in June 2013 reduced operational areas of the AFSPA to 30 police station areas. The last six-month extension to AFSPA was approved in November 2014, and after about 18 years of operation, it was repealed on 29 May 2015.

==Economy==

Tripura&#x27;s gross state domestic product for 2022–23 was at constant price (2022–23), recording 10.38% growth over the previous year. In the same period, the GDP of India was , with a growth rate of 8.55%. Annual per capita income at current price of the state was , compared to the national per capita income . In 2009, the tertiary sector of the economy (service industries) was the largest contributor to the gross domestic product of the state, contributing 53.98 per cent of the state&#x27;s economy compared to 23.07 per cent from the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, mining) and 22.95 per cent from the secondary sector (industrial and manufacturing). According to the Economic Census of 2005, after agriculture, the maximum number of workers were engaged in retail trade (28.21% of total non-agricultural workforce), followed by manufacturing (18.60%), public administration (14.54%), and education (14.40%).

Tripura is an agrarian state with more than half of the population dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27% of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91% of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics &amp; Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised &quot;jhum&quot; method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on &quot;jhum&quot; has declined over the years.
Fish farming has made significant advances in the state. At the end of 2009–10, the state produced a surplus of 104.3 million fish seeds, primarily carp. Rubber and tea are the important cash crops of the state. Tripura ranks second to Kerala in the production of natural rubber in the country. The state is known for its handicraft, particularly hand-woven cotton fabric, wood carvings, and bamboo products. High quality timber including sal, garjan, teak and gamar are found abundantly in the forests of Tripura. Tata Trusts signed a pact with Government of Tripura in July 2015 to improve fisheries and dairy production in the state.
The industrial sector of the state continues to be highly underdeveloped – brickfields and tea industry are the only two organised sectors. Tripura has considerable reservoirs of natural gas. According to estimates by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the state has 400 billion metres3 reserves of natural gas, with 16 billion metres3 is recoverable. ONGC produced 480 million metres3 natural gas in the state, in 2006–07. In 2011 and 2013, new large discoveries of natural gas were announced by ONGC. Tourism industry in the state is growing – the revenue earned in tourism sector crossed for the first time in 2009–10, and surpassed in 2010–11. Although Bangladesh is in a trade deficit with India, its export to Tripura is significantly more than import from the state; a report in the newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot; estimated Bangladesh exported commodities valued at about to the state in 2012, as opposed to &quot;very small quantity&quot; of import. Alongside legal international trade, unofficial and informal cross-border trade is rampant. In a research paper published by the Institute of Developing Economies in 2004, the dependence of Tripura&#x27;s economy on that of Bangladesh was emphasised.

The economy of Tripura can be characterised by the high rate of poverty, low capital formation, inadequate infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities contribution to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resource shortages for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistent progress in the quality of life and income of people across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has not been much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center.

The Planning Commission estimates the poverty rate of all North East Indian states by using headcount ratio of Assam (the second largest state in North East India after Arunachal Pradesh). According to 2001 Planning Commission assessment, 22 per cent of Tripura&#x27;s rural residents were below the poverty line. However, the Tripura government&#x27;s independent assessment, based on consumption distribution data, reported that, in 2001, 55 per cent of the rural population was below the poverty line. Geographic isolation and communication bottlenecks coupled with insufficient infrastructure have restricted economic growth of the state. High rate of poverty and unemployment continues to be prevalent.

== Transport==
===Air===

Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport, located 12 km northwest of Agartala at Singerbhil, is the second busiest airport in northeast India after Guwahati. There are direct flights to Kolkata, Imphal, Delhi, Shillong, Guwahati, Bangalore, Dibrugarh, Aizawl, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Chittagong. The major airlines are flybig, Air India, Akasa Air, Spicejet and IndiGo. Passenger helicopter services are available between the capital and major towns (Kailashahar, Dharmanagar) as well as to more remote areas such as Kanchanpur, Belonia and Gandacherra.

===Railway===

Agartala was connected to India&#x27;s railway network with the advent of the railways in the subcontinent in 1853 but the link was broken when India was partitioned in 1947. Railway services were established in Tripura in 1964 by constructing track from Lumding in Assam to Dharmanagar and Kailasahar in Tripura but the track did not reach Agartala. Rail transport was absent in the state until 2008–09 when the railway track was extended to the capital Agartala. The metre gauge rail track was connected to broad gauge at Lumding. The major railway stations in this line are in Agartala, Dharmanagar, and Kumarghat. This metre gauge track was converted to broad gauge in 2016 and now trains run from Agartala to Kolkata and Delhi. The total length of this railway track in Tripura state is 153 km. It is a single line without electrification. The Agartala sabroom line was coupled and became fully operational from 2019.

A new railway line is being laid westwards from Agartala to Akhaura in Bangladesh. This will reduce the distance between Agartala and Kolkata by over 1000 km and provide rail access to the Port of Chittagong.

Some major Express trains that operate from Agartala are –
Agartala – Anand Vihar Terminal Rajdhani Express

* Agartala – KSR Bengaluru Humsafar Express
* Agartala – Firozpur Cantonment Tripura Sundari Express
* Agartala – Sealdah Kanchanjunga Express
* Agartala – Deoghar Weekly Express
* Agartala – Rani Kamlapati(Bhopal) Weekly Express
* Agartala – Secunderabad Superfast Special
* Agartala – Jiribam Janshatabdi Express

===Road===

Only one major road, the National Highway 8 (NH-8), connects Tripura to the rest of India. Starting at Sabroom in southern Tripura, it heads north to the capital Agartala, turns east and then north-east to enter the state of Assam. Locally known as &quot;Assam Road&quot;, the NH-8 is often called the lifeline of Tripura. However, the highway is single lane and of poor quality; often landslides, rains or other disruptions on the highway cut the state off from its neighbours. Another National Highway, NH 108, connects the town of Panisagar in northern Tripura with Aizawl, Mizoram. The Tripura Road Transport Corporation is the government agency overlooking public transport on road. A hilly and land-locked state, Tripura is dependent mostly on roads for transport. The total length of roads in the state is of which national highways constitute and state highways , as of 2009–10. Residents in rural areas frequently use waterways as a mode of transport.

Tripura has an long international border with Bangladesh, of which is fenced, as of 2012. Several locations along the border serve as bilateral trading points between India and Bangladesh, such as Akhaura near Agartala, Raghna, Srimantpur, Belonia, Khowai and Kailasahar. A bus service exists between Agartala and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In 2013, the two countries signed an agreement to establish a railway link between Agartala and the Akhaura junction of Bangladesh. Citizens of both countries need visa to legally enter the other country; however, illegal movement and smuggling across the border are widespread.

==Media and communication==
Doordarshan (DD) has a television station in Agartala. Other full-time based channels are Headlines Tripura, News Vanguard, PB 24, Prime Television Network, Chini Khorang, Swrangchati News and many more.

As of 2014, 56 daily and weekly newspapers are published in Tripura. Most of the newspapers are published in Bengali, except for one Kokborok daily (&quot;Hachukni Kok&quot;), one Manipuri weekly (&quot;Marup&quot;), two English dailies and three bilingual weeklies. Notable dailies include &quot;Ajkal Tripura&quot;, &quot;Daily Desher Katha&quot;, &quot;Dainik Sambad&quot; and &quot;Syandan Patrika&quot;. In a study by Indian Institute of Mass Communication in 2009, 93% of the sampled in Tripura rated television as very effective for information and mass education. In the study, 67% of the sampled listened to radio and 80–90% read newspaper. Most of the major Indian telecommunication companies are present in the state, such as Airtel, Vi, Jio and BSNL. Mobile connections outnumber landline connections by a wide margin. As of 2011, the state-controlled BSNL has 57,897 landline subscribers and GSM mobile service connections. There are 84 telephone exchanges (for landlines) and 716 post offices in the state, as of 2011.

===Electricity===
Till 2014, Tripura was a power deficit state. In late 2014, Tripura reached surplus electricity production capacity by using its recently discovered natural gas resources, and installing high efficiency gas turbine power plants. The state has many power-generating stations. These are owned by Tripura State Electricity Corporation (TSECL), natural gas-powered thermal power stations at Rokhia and Baramura, and the ONGC Tripura Power Company in Palatana. The ONGC plant has a capacity of 726.6 MW, with the second plant&#x27;s commissioning in November 2014. It is the largest individual power plant in the northeast region.

The state also has a hydro power station on the Gumti River. The combined power generation from these three stations is 100–105 MW. The North Eastern Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) operates the 84 MW Agartala Gas Turbine Power Plant near Agartala. As of November 2014, another thermal power plant is being built at Monarchak.

With the newly added power generation capacity, Tripura has with enough capacity to supply all seven sister states of northeast India, as well export power to neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. With recent discoveries, the state has abundant natural gas reserves to support many more power generation plants, but lacks pipeline and transport infrastructure to deliver the fuel or electricity to India&#x27;s national grid.

===Irrigation and fertilizers===
As of 2011, of land in Tripura cultivable, of which has the potential to be covered by irrigation projects. However, only is irrigated. The state lacks major irrigation projects; it depends on medium-sized projects sourced from Gumti, Khowai (at Chakmaghat) and Manu rivers, and minor projects administered by village-level governing bodies that utilise tube wells, water pumps, tanks and lift irrigation.

ONGC and Chambal Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals are jointly building a fertiliser plant to leverage ONGC&#x27;s natural gas discoveries in Tripura. Expected to be in operation by 2017, the 1.3 million tonnes per year plant will supply the northeastern states.

===Drinking water===
Drinking Water and Sanitation (DWS) wing] of Public Works Department manages the drinking water supply in the state. Schools and Anganwadi Centers have been specifically targeted to improve drinking water supply as well as attendance to these institutions. Many areas of Tripura have the problem of excessive iron content in groundwater requiring the installation of Iron Removal Plants (IRP). Tripura State has received the best State Award for Water &amp; Sanitation under the category of Small States in the IBN7 Diamond State Award function for doing commendable work to provide drinking water supply to the people with the sparsely distributed tribal population in hamlets of hilly regions of the State. However, a study by the DWS Department found a depleting water table and excessive contamination. Still, packaged drinking water under brands &quot;Tribeni&quot;, &quot;Eco Freshh&quot;, &quot;Blue Fina&quot;, &quot;Life Drop&quot; and &quot;Aqua Zoom&quot; among others is manufactured and sold in the state. Filters of many types and brands, in addition to locally manufactured ceramic type filters, are sold in the state although their acceptance in rural areas is less.

==Education==


As per 2011 census, the literacy rate of Tripura was 87.75 per cent, the fourth-highest in India (which had a national literacy rate of 74.04 per cent). A state government survey in 2013 announced that Tripura has the highest literacy rate in India at 94.65 per cent. Schools in Tripura are run by the state government, TTAADC or private organisations, which include religious institutions. Instruction in schools is mainly in Bengali or English, though Kokborok and other regional languages are also used. Some of the special schools include Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, residential schools run by Tripura Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TTWREIS), missionary organisations like St. Paul&#x27;s,
St. Arnold&#x27;s, Holy Cross, Don Bosco, and St. John&#x27;s. The schools are affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) or the Tripura Board of Secondary Education. Under the 10+2+3 plan, after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for two years in a junior college or in a higher secondary school affiliated either to the Tripura Board of Secondary Education or to other central boards. Students choose from one of the three streams—liberal arts, commerce or science. As in the rest of India, after passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the grade 12 examination), students may enroll in general degree programs such as bachelor&#x27;s degree in arts, commerce or science, or professional degree programs such as engineering, law or medicine.

According to the Economic Review of Tripura 2010–11, Tripura has a total of 4,455 schools, of which 2,298 are primary schools. The total enrolment in all schools of the state is 767,672. Tripura has one Central University (Tripura University), one State University (M. B. B. University) and one private university (a branch of the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India). There are 15 general colleges, three engineering colleges (Tripura Institute of Technology, National Institute of Technology, Agartala and NIEILT, Agartala), two medical colleges (Agartala Government Medical College and Tripura Medical College), three nursing or paramedical colleges, three polytechnic colleges, one law college, one Government Music College , one College of Fisheries, Institute of Advance Studies in Education, one Regional College of Physical Education at Panisagar and one art college.

==Healthcare==

Healthcare in Tripura features a universal health care system run by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure is divided into three tiers – the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey – 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20% of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers the private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less than the national level, where 65.6% do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over the public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facilities, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state&#x27;s performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of malaria, diarrhoea, Japanese encephalitis and meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major malaria outbreak.

==Demographics==
===Population===
Tripura ranks second to Assam as the most populous state in North East India. According to the provisional results of 2011 census of India, Tripura has a population of 3,671,032 with 1,871,867 males and 1,799,165 females. It constitutes 0.3% of India&#x27;s population. The sex ratio of the state is 961 females per thousand males, higher than the national ratio 940. The population density is 350 persons per square kilometre. The literacy rate of Tripura in 2011 was 87.75%, above the national average of 74.04%, and third highest among all the states.

Tripura ranked sixth in Human Development Index (HDI) among 35 states and union territories of India, according to the 2006 estimate by India&#x27;s Ministry of Women and Child Development; the HDI of Tripura was 0.663, better than the all-India HDI of 0.605.

In 2011, the police in Tripura recorded 5,803 cognisable offences under the Indian Penal Code, a number second only to Assam (66,714) in North East India. The crime rate in the state was 158.1 per 100,000 people, less than the all-India average of 192.2. However, 2010 reports showed that the state topped all the states for crime against women, with a rate of 46.5 per 100,000 people, significantly more than the national rate of 18.

===Ethnic groups===

According to the 2001 census of India, Bengalis represented almost 65 per cent of Tripura&#x27;s population while the scheduled tribe population (including the Tripuris) amounted to a little over 30 per cent, with rest belonging to other minorities including Hindi speakers. The state&#x27;s &quot;scheduled tribes&quot;, recognised by the country&#x27;s constitution, consist of 19 ethnic groups and many sub-groups, with diverse languages and cultures. In 2001, the largest such group were Kokborok-speaking Tripuris, who had a population of 543,848, representing 17.0 per cent of the state&#x27;s population and 54.7 per cent of the &quot;scheduled tribe&quot; population. The other major groups, in descending order of population, were the Reang (16.6), Jamatia (7.5 per cent), Chakma (6.5 per cent), Halam (4.8 per cent), Mog (3.1 per cent), Munda (1.2 per cent), Kuki (1.2 per cent), Garo (1.1 per cent) and a sizeable Meitei population.

===Languages===

The official languages of the state are Bengali, English and Kokborok (Tripuri). Bengali is the most widely spoken language, while Kokborok is the most prominent language among the Tripuri people. Other minority languages such as Mog, Manipuri, Halam (old Kuki), Garo and Chakma, Odia, Bishnupriya, belonging to Indo-European and Sino-Tibetan families are spoken in the state. Thadou, a nearly extinct language, was spoken by only four people in one village as of 2012.

=== Religion ===
According to 2011 census, Hinduism is the majority religion in the state, followed by 83.40% of the population. Muslims make up 8.60% of the population, Christians 4.35%, and Buddhists 3.41%. Christianity is chiefly followed by members of the Kuki tribes (Halam, Ranglong, Hrangkhol, Lushai, Darlong, Thadou people etc. also known as Old Kukis) and as per 2011 census has 159,882 adherents.

===Demography of indigenous population===

Before Indian independence, Tripura was a tribal majority state. In 1941, the native Tripuris made up 62.06% of the population in present- day Tripura while the non-Tripuri people, mainly Bengalis and non-Bengalis occupies rest of the percentage. The percentage of Tripuris decreased from 62.06% in 1941 (before partition) to 48.65% (after partition) in 1951 due to East Bengali refugees who were coming from East Pakistan present-day-Bangladesh. Since 1971, the indigenous Tripuri population of Tripura has increased from 28.44% in 1981 to 31.05% in 2001. The 2011 census stated that indigenous Tripuri constitute 31.78% of the state population which is up from the previous census record of 31.05% in 2001.

===By geography===

Most of the area of Tripura is part of the TTAADC area, which is an Autonomous Region within Tripura under 6th schedule of the Indian Constitution and the western part of Tripura is called the General ward area, where Bengalis formed the overwhelming majority of the population.
The total area of the TTAADC is about 7,132.56 km2, which covers about 68% of the total area (10,491 km2) of Tripura respectively. It&#x27;s a thinly populated area of the state with vast area.

The population of the TTAADC area is 1,216,465 out of which the Native Scheduled Tribes (Tripuris) are 1,021,560, constituting an overwhelming 83.4% of the region&#x27;s population. While the population of General ward area of Tripura is 2,457,452 but out of total 10,491 km2 state area, the General region have a total area of only 3,358.44 km2, which covers only about 32% of the total area of the state.

Out of the total population of 3,673,917 (as per 2011 census) the population of Scheduled Tribes is 1,166,813 (31.76% of the state population). Therefore, the number of Scheduled Tribes of the state who reside in the TTAADC area is 87.55% of the total Indigenous population of Tripura as a whole, while small segments of the native Tribes population also reside in General ward area.

===Arrival of Bengali refugees===
During the Partition of Bengal in 1947, hundreds of thousands of Bengali refugees fled from East Bengal into India&#x27;s Tripura following the Partition of India. It is estimated that between the years 1947–51, around 610,000 Bengalis — a figure almost equal to the state&#x27;s total population poured into the state leading to a profound demographic change during this first phase. Again during the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971, in the second phase of migration, around 1.038 million Bengalis (most being Hindus) moved into various parts of Tripura as refugees with most of them settling down permanently afterwards. Until Bangladesh liberation war, Tripura had sheltered around 1.3 million refugees. The number of the refugees was almost equal to the indigenous population and the majority of them were rehabilitated and permanently settled in Tripura, altering the demography which became the basis of changes in resource distribution, economy, culture, polity, society and a cause of conflicts between the immigrants and the indigenous peoples.

==Culture==
The diverse ethno-linguistic groups of Tripura have given rise to a composite culture. The major Tripuri clans are: Tripura, Debbarma, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, and Murasing. And there are tribal groups such as Chakma, Halam(old kuki), Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Uchoi, Dhamai, Roaza, Mag, Munda, Oraon and Santhal who migrated in Tripura as tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguistic community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main non-indigenous culture. The Tripuri Maharajas were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language replaced Kokborok as the language of the court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.

Tripura is noted for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane are used to create an array of furniture, utensils, hand-held fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral to the culture of the state. Some local musical instruments are the &quot;sarinda&quot;, &quot;chongpreng&quot; (both string instruments), and &quot;sumui&quot; (a type of flute). Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls balanced on earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the last day of the month of &quot;Chaitra&quot; in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala dance of the Garo people, hai-hak dance of the Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa dance of the Mog. Alongside such traditional music, mainstream Indian musical elements such as Indian classical music and dance, Rabindra Sangeet are also practised. Sachin Dev Burman, a member of the royal family, was a maestro in the filmi genre of Indian music.

Hindus believe that &quot;Tripura Sundari&quot; is the patron goddess of Tripura and an aspect of &quot;Shakti&quot;. Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Dolyatra, Ashokastami and the worship of the &quot;Chaturdasha&quot; deities are important festivals in the state. Some festivals represent confluence of different regional traditions, such as Ganga puja, Garia puja, Kharchi puja and Ker puja. Unakoti, Pilak and Devtamura are historic sites where large collections of stone carvings and rock sculptures are noted. Like Neermahal is a cultural Water Palace of this state. Sculptures are evidence of the presence of Buddhist and Brahmanical orders for centuries, and represent a rare artistic fusion of traditional organised religions and tribal influence.

<text>The French Communist Party (, , PCF) is a communist party in France. The PCF is a member of the Party of the European Left, and its MEPs sit with The Left in the European Parliament – GUE/NGL group.

The PCF was founded in 1920 by Marxist–Leninist members of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) who supported the Bolsheviks in the 1917 Russian Revolution. It became a member of the Communist International, and followed a Marxist-Leninist line under the leadership of Maurice Thorez. In response to the threat of fascism, the PCF joined the socialist Popular Front which won the 1936 election, but it did not participate in government. During World War II, it was outlawed by the occupying Germans and became a key element of the Resistance. The PCF participated in the provisional government of the Liberation from 1944 to 1947, but for the next 30 years was excluded from government despite consistently winning more than 20 percent of the vote in elections. It fell behind the Socialist Party in the 1970s, though entered government early in François Mitterrand&#x27;s presidency (1981–1984) and participated in the Plural Left cabinet led by Lionel Jospin (1997–2002).

From 2009, the PCF was a leading member of the Left Front (), alongside Jean-Luc Mélenchon&#x27;s Left Party (PG). During the 2017 presidential election, the PCF supported Mélenchon&#x27;s candidature; however, tensions between the PCF and Mélenchon&#x27;s movement, La France Insoumise, have led the two parties to campaign separately for the general elections. Although its electoral support has declined in recent decades, the PCF retains a strong influence in French politics, especially at the local level. In 2012, the PCF claimed to have had 138,000 members, 70,000 of whom had paid their membership fees.

==History==
The French Communist Party (PCF) originated in 1920, when a majority of members resigned from the socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) party to set up the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC) with Ludovic-Oscar Frossard as its first secretary-general, with the involvement of Ho Chi Minh as one of the notable agitators participating in its creation. The new SFIC defined itself as revolutionary and democratic centralist. The 1920s saw a number of splits within the party over relations with other left-wing parties and over adherence to Comintern&#x27;s dictates. The party entered the French parliament, but also promoted strike action and opposed colonialism, a position that was isolated in the French political landscape at the time. The Intercolonial Union, created in 1922, brought together activists from the French colonies around demands for political equality (the right to vote) and social equality (&quot;equal pay for equal work&quot;). The communists thus called for fraternization with the Moroccan insurgents during the Rif War (1925–1926) and to the evacuation of Morocco by the French army, they called for an end to the fighting and the independence of French Syria during the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925–1927, and denounced the festivities of the centenary of the colonization of Algeria, organizing in particular a campaign to boycott the Paris Colonial Exposition (1931).

The party was organized around leaders who were mostly from the working class, setting up training and promotion schemes and encouraging the presentation of working-class candidates in elections. The Maurice Thorez, Jacques Duclos and Benoît Frachon team, who had been miners, metalworkers and pastry cooks respectively, had an exceptional longevity and led the French party for almost three decades. The railroad worker Pierre Semard had been secretary general of the party from 1924 to 1929.

Semard sought party unity and alliances with other parties; but leaders including Thorez (party leader from 1930 to 1964) imposed a Marxist-Leninist line from the late 1920s. With the rise of fascism after 1934 the PCF supported the Popular Front, which came to power under Léon Blum in 1936. The party supported the Second Spanish Republic and opposed the 1938 Munich Agreement with Hitler. It was the only political party in France to denounce this agreement.

The party was banned in 1939 by the government of Édouard Daladier as a result of the German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact, due to its membership in the Comintern, which opposed the War (prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany). The leadership, threatened with execution, fled abroad. After the German invasion of 1940 the party began to organise opposition to the occupation. Shortly before Germany invaded the Soviet Union the next year, the PCF formed, in May 1941, the National Front movement within the broader Resistance, together with the armed &quot;Francs-Tireurs et Partisans&quot; (FTP) group. At the same time the PCF began to work with de Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;Free France&quot; government in exile, and later took part in the National Council of the Resistance (CNR).

By the time the German occupation ended in 1944, the party had become a powerful force in many parts of France. It was among the leading parties in elections in 1945 and 1946, and entered into the governing Tripartite alliance, which pursued social reforms and statism. However, amid concerns within France and abroad over the extent of communist influence, the PCF was excluded from government in May 1947. Under pressure from Moscow, the PCF thereafter distanced itself from other parties and focused on agitation within its trade union base. For the rest of the Fourth Republic period the PCF, led by Thorez and Jacques Duclos, remained politically isolated, still taking a Marxist-Leninist line, though retaining substantial electoral support.

Although the PCF opposed de Gaulle&#x27;s formation of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the following years saw a with other left-wing forces and an increased strength in parliament. With Waldeck Rochet as its new secretary-general, the party supported François Mitterrand&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential bid in 1965. During the student riots and strikes of May 1968, the party supported the strikes while denouncing the revolutionary student movements. After heavy losses in the ensuing parliamentary elections, the party adopted Georges Marchais as leader and in 1973 entered into a &quot;Common Programme&quot; alliance with Mitterrand&#x27;s reconstituted Socialist Party (PS). It provided for an increase in wages and social benefits, a reduction in working hours, a retirement age of 60 for men and 55 for women, the expansion of workers&#x27; rights and freedoms, the abolition of the death penalty and nuclear disarmament. In 1979 it was proposed by revisionists in France that party documents should omit Marxism–Leninism and use scientific socialism in its place. Under the Common Programme, however, the PCF steadily lost ground to the PS, a process that continued after Mitterrand&#x27;s victory in 1981.

Initially allotted a minor share in Mitterrand&#x27;s government, the PCF resigned in 1984 as the government turned towards fiscal orthodoxy. Under Marchais the party largely maintained its traditional communist doctrines and structure. Extensive reform was undertaken after 1994, when Robert Hue became leader. This did little to stem the party&#x27;s declining popularity, although it entered government again in 1997 as part of the Plural Left coalition. Elections in 2002 gave worse results than ever for the PCF. Under Marie-George Buffet, the PCF turned away from parliamentary strategy and sought broader social alliances. To maintain a presence in parliament after 2007 the party&#x27;s few remaining deputies had to join others in the Democratic and Republican Left group (GDR). Subsequently, a broader electoral coalition, the Left Front (FG), was formed including the PCF, the Left Party (PG), Unitary Left, and others. The FG has brought the French communists somewhat better electoral results. Pierre Laurent was leader from 2010 to 2018, being succeeded by Fabien Roussel who stood as the party&#x27;s candidate at the 2022 French presidential election. Roussel received 2.28% of votes cast, coming in eighth place.

==Ideology==
The PCF, in contrast to weaker and more marginal communist parties in Europe, is usually seen as a left wing, rather than far-left, party in the French context. While the French far-left (LCR/NPA, LO) has refused to participate in government or engage in electoral alliances with centre-left parties such as the PS, the PCF has participated in governments in the past, and still enjoys a &quot;de facto&quot; electoral agreement with the PS (mutual withdrawals, the common practice since 1962 and in 1934–1939). Nonetheless, some observers and analysts classify the PCF as a far-left party, noting their political proximity to other far-left parties.

In the 1980s, under Georges Marchais, the PCF mixed a partial acceptance of &quot;bourgeois&quot; democracy and individual liberties with more traditional Marxist–Leninist ideas. During this same period the PCF was run on democratic centralist lines and structured itself as a revolutionary party in the Leninist sense and rejected criticism of the Soviet Union. Under Robert Hue&#x27;s leadership after 1994, the PCF&#x27;s ideology and internal organization underwent major changes. Hue clearly rejected the Soviet model, and reserved very harsh criticism for Soviet leaders who had &quot;rejected, for years, human rights and &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; democracy&quot; and had oppressed individual liberties and aspirations. Today, the PCF considers the Soviet Union as a &#x27;perversion&#x27; of the communist model and unambiguously rejects Stalinism. It has not attributed the failure of the Soviet Union as being that of communism, rather stating that the failure of Soviet socialism was the failure of one model &quot;among others&quot;, including the capitalist or social democratic models. It also tried to downplay the PCF&#x27;s historic attachment to Moscow and the Soviet Union.

Since then, the PCF&#x27;s ideology has been marked by significant ideological evolution on some topics, but consistency on other issues. Some of the most marked changes have come on individual rights and immigration. After having vilified homosexuality and feminism as &quot;the rubbish of capitalism&quot; in the 1970s, the PCF now supports gay rights and feminism. In the 1980s, the PCF supported reducing the age of consent for homosexual relationships, and opposed attempts to re-penalize homosexuality. In 1998, the PCF voted in favour of the civil solidarity pact (PACS), civil unions, including for homosexual couples. The PCF supports both same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption. On 12 February 2013, PCF deputies voted in favour of same-sex marriage and adoption rights in the National Assembly, though PCF deputy Patrice Carvalho voted against. The PCF also supports feminist movements, and supports policies to further promote gender equality and parity.

Despite its moral conservatism in the 1930s and 1960s, in 1946, it elected seventeen of the first thirty-three women deputies. In 1956, there were only nineteen women in the National Assembly, but fifteen were Communists.

On the issue of immigration, the PCF&#x27;s positions have also evolved significantly since the 1980s. In the 1981 presidential election, Georges Marchais ran a controversial campaign on immigration which was harshly criticized by anti-racism organizations at the time. In 1980, the PCF&#x27;s leadership voted in favour of limiting immigration. The same year, Marchais supported the PCF mayor of Vitry-sur-Seine who had destroyed a home for Malian migrant workers; the PCF claimed that the right-wing government was trying to push immigrants into ghettos in Communist working-class cities. The newspaper also alleged that PCF municipal administrations had been working to limit the number of immigrants in housing projects. However, today the PCF supports the regularization of illegal immigrants.

One historical consistency in the PCF&#x27;s ideology has been its staunch opposition to capitalism, which must be &quot;overcome&quot; because according to the PCF the capitalist system is &quot;exhausted&quot; and &quot;on the verge of collapse&quot;. The PCF has interpreted the current course of globalization as a confirmation of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels&#x27;s view on the future evolution of capitalism. The party feels that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the Great Recession have further justified its calls to overcome capitalism. However, the PCF has remained somewhat vague on how capitalism will be &#x27;overcome&#x27; and what will replace it, placing heavy emphasis on utopic models or values.

The text adopted at the XXXVI Congress in February 2013 reiterated the party&#x27;s call on the need to &quot;overcome&quot; capitalism, fiercely denounced by the PCF as having led to &quot;savage competition&quot;, &quot;the devastation of the planet&quot; and &quot;barbarism&quot;. It contrasts its vision of capitalism with its proposed alternative, described as an egalitarian, humanist, and democratic alternative. It emphasizes human emancipation, the development of &quot;each and every one&quot;, the right to happiness and the equal dignity of each human being regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. The party further posits that such an egalitarian society is impossible within capitalism, which &quot;unleashes domination and hatred&quot;.

The party is generally seen as Eurosceptic.

For the 2022 French legislative election, the party joined the New Ecologic and Social People&#x27;s Union (NUPES) bloc of left-wing and green parties. In the alliance, they were the only party to support nuclear energy.

===2012 platform===
Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the FG&#x27;s platform in the 2012 presidential election was broken up into nine overarching themes.
* &quot;Sharing the wealth and abolishing social insecurity&quot; – banning market-based layoffs () for companies which make profits, raise the minimum wage (SMIC) to €1,700, setting a maximum wage differential of 1 to 20 in all businesses, right to retirement with a full pension at 60, defending public services, stopping public sector spending cuts (RGPP), setting a maximum wage at €360,000 and a 35-hour workweek.
* &quot;Reclaiming power from banks and financial markets&quot; – changing the European Central Bank&#x27;s policy to favour job creation and public services, controlling financial speculation, raising the capital gains tax and the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF), abolishing fiscal loopholes and privileges, taxing corporations&#x27; financial revenues and creating a &quot;public financial pole&quot; to reorient credit towards jobs, innovation and sustainable development.
* &quot;Ecological planning&quot; – nationalizing &quot;Électricité de France&quot;, &quot;Gaz de France&quot; and Areva to create a publicly owned energy sector, creating a national public water service, a new transportation policy promoting public transportation and taxing the transportation of non-vital merchandise.
* &quot;Producing differently&quot; – a new model of development and economic growth which respects the environment and individuals, redefining industrial priorities, new rights for employees and creating a gross national happiness indicator.
* &quot;The Republic, for real&quot; – reaffirming the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, creating a ministry for women and equality, repealing the HADOPI law, regularizing illegal immigrants, opposition to the golden rule of fiscal balance and creating jobs in the public sector.
* &quot;Convene a constituent assembly for the Sixth Republic&quot; – convening a constituent assembly, repealing the 2010 local and regional government reform, proportional representation in all elections, reducing presidential powers and strengthening parliamentary powers, and guaranteeing judicial and press freedom.
* &quot;Repealing the Lisbon Treaty and creating another Europe&quot; – repealing the Treaty of Lisbon, opposition to the European Fiscal Compact, proposing and adopting a new European treaty which would &quot;prioritize social progress and democracy&quot; and reforming the statutes of the European Central Bank.
* &quot;To change the course of globalization&quot; – withdrawing French troops from the war in Afghanistan, French withdrawal from NATO, recognizing the independence of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders, creation of a Tobin tax to finance international development and cooperation, debt forgiveness for low-income countries.
* &quot;Prioritizing human emancipation&quot; – creating jobs in public education, spending 1% of GDP on arts and culture, and doubling investment in research.

The platform also supported same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, voting rights for resident foreigners, euthanasia, and constitutional recognition of abortion.

===French nationalism===
The French Communist Party inherited from the Jacobins the concept of France as a centralised, French-speaking, unitary state, with a unitary culture and it is opposed to the separatism and regional identity of other European minority groups native to the area of what consists the French Republic. For instance in 1984, the Soviet ethnographer Solomon Bruk (who had worked under Sergey Tolstov) published a study on France and mentioned the existence of other ethnic groups in the state such as Bretons, Corsicans, Alsatians, Basques, Catalans, Flemish and others. In response to this work, General Secretary Georges Marchais wrote a letter of protest in February 1984, complaining bitterly to the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
==Elected officials==
* Deputies: Elsa Faucillon, Soumya Bourouaha, Pierre Dharréville, Jean-Paul Dufrègne, Sébastien Jumel, André Chassaigne, Stephane Little, Alain Bruneel, Hubert Wulfranc, Fabien Roussel, Jean-Paul Lecoq
* Senators: Peter Lawrence, Pierre Ouzoulias, Christine Prunaud, Michelle Greaume, Éric Bocquet, Celine Brulin, Fabien Gay, Cathy Apourceau-Poly, Éliane Assassi, Laurence Cohen, Cécile Cukierman, Pascal Savoldelli

The PCF does not, , have any MEPs. It has two Presidents of the General Council – in the Val-de-Marne and Allier. The PCF lost Seine-Saint-Denis, which it had held since the 1960s, to the PS in 2008.

==Internal organization==
The PCF has traditionally been a &quot;mass party&quot;, although Maurice Duverger had differentiated it from other mass parties because the PCF kept a tight control over membership and regularly expelled unsuitable members. In its heyday, the PCF maintained a large base of members and the party&#x27;s political and electoral actions were supported in society by a trade union, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT); a newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;; and a large number of front organizations or associations in civil society which organized a large number of political or non-political social activities for PCF members. One such activity which still exists today is the annual &quot;Fête de l&#x27;Humanité&quot; organized by the &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;. French and foreign left-wing parties, organizations or movements are represented and the activities feature musical performances.

Since the PCF&#x27;s decline began in the 1970s, however, it has seen its membership base slowly dry up and its allied organizations disappear or distance themselves from the party. The PCF claimed 520,000 members in 1978; 330,000 in 1987; 270,000 in 1996; and 133,000 in 2002. In 2008, the party claimed that it had 134,000 members of which 79,000 were up to date on their membership fees. In the 2011 internal primary, 69,277 members were registered to vote and 48,631 (70.2%) did so. The party likely has about 70,000 members as of today, but only about 40 to 50 thousand seem to actively participate in the party&#x27;s organization and political activities.

According to studies by the CEVIPOF in 1979 and 1997, the makeup of the PCF&#x27;s membership has also changed significantly since 1979. The most marked change was a major decline in the share of manual workers () in the party&#x27;s membership, with a larger number of employees and middle-classes, especially those who work in the public sector. The form of political action taken by members has also changed, with less emphasis on direct political or electoral action but a greater emphasis on social work and protests.

The party&#x27;s structures were democratized at the 1994 Congress, dropping democratic centralism and allowing for the public expression of disapproval or dissent with the party line or leadership. The party&#x27;s top posts, like that of &#x27;secretary-general&#x27;, were renamed (secretary-general became national-secretary). The party, since 2000, is now led by a national council, which serves as the leadership between congresses; and the executive committee, which is charged with applying the national council&#x27;s decisions. The national-secretary is elected by delegates at the congress. Likewise, the national council is elected by list voting at every congress. A reform of statutes in 2001 has allowed &quot;alternative texts&quot; – dissent from the text proposed by the PCF leadership – to be presented and voted on; dissident lists to those backed by the leadership may also run for the national council.

The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) was dominated by the PCF after 1946, with almost all its leaders between 1947 and 1996 (Benoît Frachon, Georges Séguy, Henri Krasucki, Louis Viannet) also serving in the PCF&#x27;s national leadership structures. For years, the CGT and the PCF were close and almost indissociable allies – notably in May 1968 when both the CGT and PCF were eager for a restoration of social order and welcomed the Grenelle agreements. While the CGT has remained the largest trade union in France, it has taken its independence vis-à-vis the PCF. Louis Viannet spectacularly quit the national bureau of the PCF in 1996 and Bernard Thibault, the CGT&#x27;s leader between 1999 and 2013, left the PCF&#x27;s national council in 2001.

&quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; has retained closer ties with the PCF. The newspaper was founded by Jean Jaurès in 1904 as the socialist movement&#x27;s mouthpiece, and it followed the communist majority following the split in 1920. After having been the official newspaper of the PCF, with a readership of up to 100,000 in 1945, the newspaper&#x27;s readership and sales declined substantially partly due to the PCF&#x27;s concomitant decline. In 1999, the mention of the newspaper&#x27;s link to the PCF was dropped and the PCF no longer determines its editorial stance. It sold an average of 46,929 newspapers per day in 2012; down from 53,530 in 2007.

===Factions===
There are no formal organized factions or political groupings within the PCF. This was originally due to the practice of democratic centralism, but even after the democratization of the PCF structure after 1994 the ban on the organization of formal factions within the party remained. According to party statutes, the PCF supports the &quot;pluralism of ideas&quot; but the right to pluralism &quot;may not be translated into an organizations of tendencies&quot;. Nevertheless, certain factions and groups are easily identifiable within the PCF and they are &quot;de facto&quot; expressed officially by different orientation texts or lists for leadership elections at party congresses.
* Majority: the current leadership of the PCF since 2003 is around Marie-George Buffet and Pierre Laurent and supports the continued existence of the PCF, but with the need for internal transformations. Vis-à-vis the PS, the PCF leadership has taken a more autonomous stance but it still sees the PS as a potential electoral partner (in runoff elections or in local elections) and even as a potential governing partner. The leadership has been generally strongly supportive of the Left Front alliance with other parties, which it sees as a &quot;new Popular Front&quot; as a culmination of its attempts, undertaken since 2003, to broaden the PCF&#x27;s base to social movements, associations, unions and other left-wing or far-left parties.
* Orthodox: the heterogeneous faction of PCF &quot;orthodox&quot; refers to those traditionalist members who opposed the of the 1990s and wish to return to Marxist–Leninist fundamentals. The orthodox faction opposes electoral alliances or governing coalitions with the PS, and it has also proven fairly lukewarm to the Left Front and has often been critical of Jean-Luc Mélenchon&#x27;s influence over the FG and his 2012 candidacy. Unlike the majority which supports European integration under the form &quot;social Europe&quot; or &quot;another Europe&quot;, the orthodox wish to withdraw from the European Union and the Eurozone. Prominent orthodox factions and leaders include Jean-Jacques Karman&#x27;s Communist Left, Emmanuel Dang Tran&#x27;s PCF section in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, André Gerin, Alain Bocquet, and Patrice Carvalho. The PCF orthodox factions has strong support in the old PCF federations in northern France (Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Somme, Seine-Maritime) or other federations such as the Meurthe-et-Moselle, the Haute-Saône, Aisne and Tarn.
: Some orthodox communists have chosen to leave the PCF. In 2004, the FNARC group around Georges Hage founded the small Pole of Communist Revival in France (PRCF). Maxime Gremetz was sidelined from the PCF in 2006, after major disagreements with the leadership, and has since founded a small political movement (Anger and Hope, &quot;Colère et espoir&quot;) active only in his native Picardy. A group of hardline orthodox around former PCF senator founded the &quot;Communistes&quot; party.
* &quot;Novateurs&quot;, also known as conservatives: a small faction led by supporters of Georges Marchais&#x27; old political line (i.e. traditional Marxism adapted to modern circumstances) as developed by PCF economist and historian Paul Boccara, who developed the idea of state monopoly capitalism. Leaders of the faction include Nicolas Marchand and Yves Dimicoli.
* &quot;La Riposte&quot;: a political association within the PCF which was the French section of the International Marxist Tendency, a Trotskyist entryist organization, until 2014. They are ideologically close to the orthodox faction on rejecting alliances with the PS or a return to Marxist fundamentals but they differ significantly from the orthodox faction in their severe condemnations of Stalinism and the later Soviet Union. They also support the Left Front.
* &quot;Huistes&quot;: the allies of former secretary-general Robert Hue (1994–2001) have mostly left the PCF. Hue&#x27;s leadership was marked by internal democratizations as part of his &quot;mutation&quot;, but also close cooperation and alliances with the PS. The &quot;Huistes&quot; tend to be the most supportive of electoral and government alliances with the PS. Hue remains, technically, a member of the PCF; but he has broken with the current leadership. As a senator, he sits in the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE) and leads a small political movement, the Progressive Unitary Movement (MUP) which has one deputy elected in 2012 with PS support and who sits with the Radical Party of the Left (PRG) group in the National Assembly. The MUP supports the creation of a broad alliance with the PS, the Greens (EELV), the PRG and even some centrists. Besides Hue, some of prominent followers include Jean-Claude Gayssot, Jack Ralite or Ivan Renar.
* &quot;Refondateurs&quot;/&quot;Rénovateurs&quot;: the reformist faction of the PCF, known either as &quot;refondateurs&quot; or &quot;rénovateurs&quot;, has mostly left the PCF today, but they played an important role in the PCF&#x27;s internal politics for decades and they continue to be closely associated to the PCF through the Left Front. The reformist faction, ideologically aligned with the New Left, Eurocommunism, ecosocialism, feminism and democratic socialism, has long been at odds with the PCF&#x27;s leadership. Under Marchais, they opposed the traditionalist Marxist and pro-Soviet direction of the party and chafed at the party&#x27;s democratic centralism.
: Many dissident Communist reformists supported Pierre Juquin&#x27;s candidacy in the 1988 presidential election, alongside &#x27;red-green&#x27; ecosocialists, the remnants of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) and the LCR. PCF dissidents who had backed Juquin&#x27;s candidacy, including former cabinet ministers Marcel Rigout and Charles Fiterman participated in the foundation of the Convention for a Progressive Alternative (CAP) in 1994, which has since obtained limited support only in a few departments. Jean-Pierre Brard, the CAP&#x27;s sole parliamentarian until his defeat in 2012, sat with the PCF in the National Assembly.
: Reformists who remained within the PCF, such as Patrick Braouezec, François Asensi and Jacqueline Fraysse, opposed Hue and Buffet&#x27;s leadership: they did not support the PCF&#x27;s presidential candidates in 2002 and 2007, and they clamored for the re-foundation of the PCF as part of a broader left-wing movements including left-wing Greens, ecosocialists, the far-left, social movements and left-wing associations. Despite the creation of the Left Front, the reformists led by Braouezec left the PCF in 2010 and joined the small Federation for a Social and Ecological Alternative (FASE) which is now a component of the Left Front.

====Factional strength====
Preparatory votes on orientation texts for PCF Congresses since 2003:
At the XXXIV Congress in 2008, for the election of the national council, the majority&#x27;s list won 67.73% from the congress&#x27; delegates against 16.38% for Marie-Pierre Vieu&#x27;s &quot;huiste&quot; list backed by the &quot;refondateurs&quot;, 10.26% for André Gerin&#x27;s orthodox list and 5.64% for Nicolas Marchand&#x27;s &quot;novateur&quot; list.

==Popular support and electoral record==
Currently, the PCF retains some strength in suburban Paris, in the Nord section of the old coal mining area in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, the industrial harbours of Le Havre and Dieppe, in some departments of central France, such as Allier and Cher (where a form of sharecropping existed, in addition to mining and small industrial-mining centres such as Commentry and Montceau-les-Mines), the industrial mining region of northern Meurthe-et-Moselle (Longwy) and in some cities of the south, such as the industrial areas of Marseille and nearby towns, as well as the working-class suburbs surrounding Paris (the ), Lyon, Saint-Étienne, Alès and Grenoble. The PCF is also strong in the Cévennes mountains, a left-wing rural anti-clerical stronghold with a strong Huguenot minority.

Communist traditions in the &quot;Red Limousin&quot;, the Pas-de-Calais, Paris proper, Nièvre, Finistère, Alpes-Maritimes and Var have been hurt significantly by demographic changes (Var, Alpes-Maritimes, Finistère), a loss of voters to the Socialist Party due to good local Socialist infrastructure or strongmen (Nièvre, Pas-de-Calais, Paris) or due to the emergence of rival parties on the radical left (the Convention for a Progressive Alternative, a party of reformist communists, in the Limousin and Val-de-Marne).

There exist isolated Communist bases in the rural anti-clerical areas of southwestern Côtes-d&#x27;Armor and northwestern Morbihan; in the industrial areas of Le Mans; in the shipbuilding cities of Saint-Nazaire, La Seyne-sur-Mer (there are no more ships built in La Seyne); and in isolated industrial centres built along the old Paris-Lyon railway (the urban core of Romilly-sur-Seine, Aube has elected a Communist general councillor since 1958).

During the course of the 20th century, the French communists were considered to be pioneers in local government, providing not only efficient street lighting and clean streets, but also public entertainment, public housing, municipal swimming pools, day nurseries, children&#x27;s playgrounds, and public lavatories. In 1976, for instance, the communist mayor of Sarcelles, Henry Canacos, was named &quot;best mayor in the Paris region&quot; by Vie Publique (a trade periodical for urban planners and administrators) for enriching Sarcelles&#x27; public spaces with new restaurants, movie theatres, cafes, more parks, a large shopping mall, and better transportation. Education also became, in the words of one text, an &quot;identifiable characteristic of Communist government at the local level&quot;. A study of municipal budgets that was completed in 1975 (but using data from 1968) found that while Communist local government spent 34% less than non-Communist Left governments and 36% less than moderate-Right governments for maintenance, it nevertheless spent 49% more than moderate Right governments and 36% more than non-Communist Left governments for education and educational support.

==Publications==
The PCF publishes the following:
* &quot;Communistes&quot; (&quot;Communists&quot;)
* &quot;Info Hebdo&quot; (&quot;Weekly News&quot;)
* &quot;Economie et Politique&quot; (&quot;Economics and Politics&quot;)

Traditionally, it was also the owner of the French daily &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; (&quot;Humanity&quot;), founded by Jean Jaurès. Although the newspaper is now independent, it remains close to the PCF. The paper is sustained by the annual &quot;Fête de L&#x27;Humanité&quot; festival, held in La Courneuve, a working class suburb of Paris. This event remains the biggest festival in France, with attendees during a three-day period.

During the 1970s, the PCF registered success with the children&#x27;s magazine it founded, &quot;Pif gadget&quot;.

<text>Nemesis the Warlock is a comic series created by writer Pat Mills and artist Kevin O&#x27;Neill which appeared in the pages of the British weekly comics anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot;. The title character, a fire-breathing demonic alien, fights against the fanatical Torquemada, Grand Master of the Terran Empire in Earth&#x27;s distant future, and his attempts to exterminate all alien life.

==Publication history==

The series began in 1980, in prog 167 of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, with a story called &quot;Comic Rock&quot; &quot;The Terror Tube&quot;, in which a freedom fighter called Nemesis escaped from Torquemada, the chief of the Tube Police, after a protracted chase through a complex travel-tube system on a planet called Termight, later revealed to be Earth (&quot;Mighty Terra&quot;). All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his streamlined organic spaceship, the Blitzspear. In &quot;Terror Tube&quot; the police were portrayed as a cross between the Spanish Inquisition (Torquemada is named after the notorious inquisitor Tomás de Torquemada) and the Ku Klux Klan (or from Spanish Easter penitents), making it easier to position them as the villains.

&quot;Terror Tube&quot; was the first of a planned series of one-offs inspired by popular music, called &quot;Comic Rock&quot; – in this case The Jam&#x27;s &quot;Going Underground&quot;. The series never got going, but did produce a second Nemesis story, a two-parter called &quot;Killer Watt&quot;, in which Torquemada chased Nemesis through a bizarre teleport system based on telephone lines.

These stories proved popular, prompting Mills and O&#x27;Neill to develop a regular series, &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;, which combined the early high-concept science fiction with fantasy in the &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; mould. Torquemada was promoted from chief of the Tube Police to Grand Master of Termight. Nemesis was revealed as a demonic alien with a horned dragon-like head based on the finned nose of his Blitzspear, fighting to protect aliens from Torquemada&#x27;s genocidal tyranny, although his inhuman attitude and anarchic &quot;Khaos&quot; philosophy gave him an ambiguous morality; for example, in Book Five, &quot;The Vengeance of Thoth&quot;, Nemesis is forced to hijack a bus full of children, which he then deliberately crashes, killing all on board as he escapes.

Book Nine concluded in 1989, and the character barely appeared for ten years. Finally, in 1999, Mills and artists Henry Flint and O&#x27;Neill wrapped up the series with Book Ten: The Final Conflict, and an epilogue of sorts, &quot;Deadlock&quot;, which explored the political state of Termight in the aftermath of Nemesis&#x27; and Torquemada&#x27;s deaths.

==Production==
O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s imaginative, grotesque art helped to establish the popularity of the series, but the efforts he put into creating it led to a low rate of productivity. There were a number of delays in the publication of Book One, and a second book was drawn by Jesus Redondo. This and the higher rates of pay available in America led O&#x27;Neill to leave the series prior to Book Four - although a handful of episodes he had drawn just after &quot;Killer Watt&quot; introduced the fourth book. O&#x27;Neill was replaced by Bryan Talbot. Other artists to draw the series include John Hicklenton, David Roach, Clint Langley and Henry Flint. O&#x27;Neill returned to the strip to illustrate its intended last-ever episode and later for a special anniversary story.

==Characters==
===Warlocks===

Warlocks are a sexually dimorphic species of aliens who are capable of sorcery. Both males and females are horned, fire-breathing and of demonic appearance; females have a centaur-like quadrupedal morphology while males are bipedal but have unusual combination plantigrade / digitigrade leg joints, somewhat resembling satyrs.
; Nemesis the Warlock : The main character and antihero of the series, Nemesis ostensibly fights to free the galaxy from tyranny. Mills decided that with a religious fanatic as the arch-villain, it would be fitting to have a demon as the hero.
; Chira : White Warlock and first wife of Nemesis, mother of his son Thoth. Assassinated by agents of Termight.
; Magna : Black Warlock and second wife of Nemesis. Jealous of Chira, she swallowed Nemesis&#x27; familiar Grobbendonk whole as the first phase of her plan to separate him from his allies, and leaked information to Torquemada that allowed him to locate Chira and Thoth. Killed by Nemesis minutes after their wedding, when her telepathic block failed and he discovered her misdeeds.
; Thoth : Son of Nemesis and Chira. As a hideous larva-like infant he hypnotizes Sir Hargan, the Terminator who killed his mother, into believing him to be a cute little human baby that he needed to protect. Years later he grows into a powerful rival to Nemesis, as he blames his father for not being there to save his mother.
; Great Uncle Baal : Nemesis&#x27; eccentric great uncle and former master of Grobbendonk, banished by Nemesis for his controversial experiments on humans.

===Humans===
; Tomas de Torquemada: Primary antagonist of the series, a haughty tyrant and fascist human supremacist who rules the Earth with an iron fist and is hellbent on ridding the universe of all alien life. Through Past life regression it is shown that he was many people from Earth&#x27;s history, including Matthew Hopkins, Colonel John Chivington, Adolf Hitler and the original Torquemada himself. His motto is &quot;Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave!&quot;
; Purity Brown : Human aide to Nemesis. Her father was taken away and presumably killed when she was only fourteen (as revealed in Book Five; The Vengeance of Thoth) by thought detectors for having a dream in which he insulted Torquemada.
; Candida de Torquemada : Wife of Tomas de Torquemada and mother of two of his children, both of whom are among those slain in a bus crash caused by Nemesis. On several occasions, including a major plot arc for book 5, Tomas is shown to genuinely love Candida to the extent he is willing to consort with aliens in an effort to prevent her from leaving him.
; Sister Stern : Insane wife of Tomas de Torquemada and mother of his third child, whom she occasionally considered impure, so tried to commit Filicide, before Tomas ordered her to commit suicide.
; Grand Dragon Mazarin : The leader of Termight after Torquemada&#x27;s death. A reformer, he ended the persecution of aliens. After a Terminator mutiny upon Torquemada&#x27;s return he was executed by Tomas via torture.
; Nostradamus de Torquemada : Insane brother of Tomas de Torquemada. He was horribly disfigured when Tomas abandoned him during an ambush by the Primords, and was later hidden away in a lunatic asylum to conceal Tomas&#x27; disgrace. Nostradamus was originally introduced into the series as Tomas&#x27; Grandfather, and not shown to be his brother until Book five.

===Other aliens===
; Grobbendonk : The comical little rat/caterpillar-like alien familiar of Nemesis stolen from his Great Uncle Baal. Grobbendonk speaks Gibberish, a Fringe World dialect. Deliberately eaten alive by Magna days before her wedding to Nemesis.

===Robots===
; The ABC Warriors : Robot mercenaries and allies of Nemesis.

==Stories==

Most of the saga was told in &#x27;books&#x27; of between 9 and 20 episodes, with additional stories told in one-offs, which appeared in annuals, specials, or in the weekly comic.
There are a number of collections of the original instalments available, which roughly follow the books as they were originally published. The first four books were not given individual titles upon their original publication.

a. This Prog 2000 was a special edition outside the comic&#x27;s normal numbering scheme released to mark the year 2000. Another issue numbered 2000 was published within the comic&#x27;s normal numbering scheme in 2016. 

The series &quot;Deadlock&quot;, by Pat Mills and Henry Flint, was a direct sequel to Nemesis. Prog 2000 (20 September 2016) featured a follow-up Nemesis story (written by Mills and once more drawn by O&#x27;Neill) &#x27;Tubular Hells&#x27; which reversed the destruction of Nemesis but it has to this point not led to further exploration of the character.

==Collected editions==
The series has been collected into a number of trade paperbacks, including:

*&quot;The Complete Nemesis the Warlock&quot;:
** &quot;Volume 1&quot; (collects &quot;Terror Tube&quot;, &quot;Killer Watt&quot;, &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; Books 1–4, &quot;The Sword Sinister&quot; and &quot;The Secret Life of the Blitzspear&quot;, 320 pages, Rebellion, 2007, )
** &quot;Volume 2&quot; (collects &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; Books 5–7, Rebellion, 2007, )
** &quot;Volume 3&quot; (collects &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot; Books 8–10, Rebellion, 2007, )

==In other media==

===Computer games===
&quot;Nemesis the Warlock: The Death of Torquemada&quot; was released as a game made for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. The C64 version of this game was made by Martech in 1987, programmer Michael J. Archer, musician Rob Hubbard

===Music video===
The video for Shriekback&#x27;s 1985 single &quot;Nemesis&quot; from the album &quot;Oil &amp; Gold&quot; features Nemesis the Warlock.

===Toys and games===
Wizkids / NECA have released three figures of Nemesis the Warlock as part of their Heroclix collectable miniatures game (Rookie, Experienced and Veteran versions). These were only released in the United Kingdom, alongside other 2000AD related figures, as part of the &quot;Indy&quot; expansion to the game. This led to something of an outcry from the American fans of both the game and the character, and this style of &quot;regional&quot; figure-release was not continued in later sets of Heroclix.

<text>The acoustic bass guitar (sometimes shortened to acoustic bass or initialized ABG) is a bass instrument with a hollow wooden body similar to, though usually larger than, a steel-string acoustic guitar. Like the traditional electric bass guitar and the double bass, the acoustic bass guitar commonly has four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an octave below the lowest four strings of the 6-string guitar.

Because it can sometimes be difficult to hear an acoustic bass guitar without an amplifier even in settings with other acoustic instruments, most acoustic basses have pickups, either magnetic or piezoelectric or both, so that they can be amplified with a bass amp.

Traditional music of Mexico features several varieties of acoustic bass guitars, such as the [[Guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]], a very large, deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass guitar played in Mariachi bands, the [[leona (instrument)|león]], plucked with a pick, and the [[bajo sexto]], with six pairs of strings.

Also another name can be Bajoloche the bajoloche is used when slapping or plucking the string. Groups who made it popular were Arsenal Effectivo and Herencia de Patrones.

==History==

The Bassoguitar built by the Regal Musical Instrument Company was likely the first mass-produced acoustic bass to make use of a guitar-like body. This was an upright instrument, too big to play in a transverse position. The first modern acoustic bass guitar was developed in the mid-1950s by Kay of Chicago. Harptone started producing their B4 model in 1965 under the name Supreme; production ended in 1975. They also made a very limited number under the Standel logo. Ernie Ball began producing a model in the early 70&#x27;s. Ball&#x27;s aim was to provide bass guitarists with a more acoustic-sounding instrument that would match better with the sound of acoustic guitars. Ball stated that &quot;...if there were electric bass guitars to go with electric guitars then you ought to have acoustic basses to go with acoustic guitars.&quot; Ball said that &quot;...the closest thing to an acoustic bass was the Mexican guitarron...in mariachi bands, so I bought one down in Tijuana and tinkered with it.&quot;

Ball collaborated with George William Fullerton, a former employee at Fender, to develop the Earthwood acoustic bass guitar, which was introduced in 1972. Production of this instrument ceased in 1974, resuming a few years later under the direction of Ernie Ball&#x27;s employee Dan Norton, until production finally ended again in 1985. The Earthwood acoustic bass guitar was quite large and deep in contrast to most instruments in current production, which gave it more volume, especially in the low register.photo 1 The Ernie Ball company describes Ball&#x27;s design as &quot;an idea before its time&quot;; the instrument was little used in acoustic musical performances until the late 1980s, when the acoustic basses were used in performances on the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; television program. The Earthwood was quickly supplanted by the Washburn AB-40 designed by Mick Donner and Richard Siegle. The AB-40 and the more affordable AB-20 became the instrument of choice for bass players appearing on &quot;Unplugged&quot;.

Folk bass player Ashley Hutchings used the acoustic bass guitar with his Etchingham Steam Band in 1974 and 1975. An early user of the acoustic bass guitar in rock was English multi-instrumentalist and composer Mike Oldfield, who had one custom-built for him by luthier Tony Zemaitis in the mid-1970s and used the bass on a number of his recordings from that time onwards, a prominent example being his 1975 album &quot;Ommadawn&quot;.

==Construction and tuning==
Unlike the electric bass guitar, which is generally a solid body instrument, the acoustic bass guitar usually has a hollow wooden body similar to (though usually somewhat larger than) that of the steel-string acoustic guitar. The majority of acoustic basses are fretted, but some are fretless instead. Semi-fretted versions also exist, although they are quite rare.

Like the traditional electric bass and the double bass, the acoustic bass guitar commonly has four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an octave below the lowest four strings of the 6-string guitar. Like the electric bass guitar, models with five or more strings have been produced, although these are less common. In part, this is because the body of an acoustic bass guitar is too small to produce a resonance of acceptable volume at lower pitches on the low &quot;B&quot; string. One solution uses the five string acoustic bass to add an additional high string (&quot;E-A-D-G-C&quot;) instead of adding a low &quot;B&quot;. Another solution is to rely on amplification to reproduce the low &quot;B&quot; string&#x27;s notes, or by making the body a little bit larger.

There are also semi-acoustic models, fitted with pickups, for use with an amplifier. The soundbox of these instruments is not large enough to amplify the sound. Instead, it produces a distinctive tone when amplified, similarly to semi-acoustic electric guitars. Thin-body semi-acoustic basses such as the violin-shaped Höfner made famous by the early Beatles and several Fender models are not normally regarded as acoustic basses at all, but rather as hollow-bodied bass guitars. There are also semi-acoustic basses such as Godin Guitars&#x27; &quot;A-Series&quot; that, once amplified, sound much closer between acoustic bass guitars and upright basses (double bass), and have been used in professional circles to &quot;simulate&quot; one when it would be impractical for transportation and other reasons to use a full-sized upright bass. As with semi-acoustic electric guitars, the line between acoustic instruments fitted with pickups and electric instruments with tone-enhancing bodies is sometimes hard to draw. Some instruments can also be equipped with a variety of pickups such as piezo pickups, the &quot;standard&quot; of acoustic-electric instruments as well as synth pickups that can replay &quot;virtual&quot; upright bass sounds and bring a semi-acoustic bass much closer to a double bass sonically.

Saga Musical Instruments produces a four-string bass resonator guitar under their &quot;Regal&quot; brand name.videos National Reso-Phonic Guitars also produce three models of resonator bass guitar. One notable player of the resonator bass guitar is Les Claypool of Primus, who plays Regal RD-05 resonator basses.

==Manufacturers==
Other manufacturers of acoustic bass guitars (not mentioned above) include Alvarez, Baton Rouge, Boulder Creek Guitars, Breedlove, Chesbro Music Company (Teton Guitars), Cort, Crafter, Jerzey, Dean, Eko, Epiphone, Eston, Fender, Furch, Gibson, Gold Tone, Guild, Ibanez, Larrivée, Lindo Guitars, Luna Guitars, Martin, Maton, Michael Kelly, Oscar Schmidt by Washburn, Ovation and its subsidiary Applause, Ozark, Prestige, Ribbecke Halfling Bass, Samick, Sigma Guitars, Sunlite, Sandberg, Spector, Stagg, Tagima, Tacoma, Takamine, Tanglewood, Taylor, Vintage Guitars, Washburn and Warwick.

==Mexican bass guitars==

Traditional music of Mexico features varieties of acoustic bass guitars. The guitarrón is a very large, deep-bodied Mexican 6-string acoustic bass guitar played in Mariachi bands. The bajo sexto, with six pairs of strings, resembles a twelve-string guitar tuned an octave lower. The heavy gauge strings generate a large string tension, yet the guitar is built relatively lightly. Musicians began to adopt the bajo sexto in Texas in the 1920s with the rise of &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; music, and it remains in common use for parts that would be played by the piano in traditional American popular music. The tuning of these instruments is (capital letters are an octave lower than small letters):
:Baja sexto: Ee Aa Dd Gg Cc Ff
:Bajo sexto: Ee Aa Dd Gg Bb ee 

Other Latin American acoustic bass guitars exist as well, such as the Bordonua.

&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; debuted at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, on which it charted for 18 weeks. It was promoted with four singles; including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Nigga&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot;. &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2006, has sold 1.5 million copies in the United States. A critical success, it has been ranked on several publications&#x27; lists of hip-hop&#x27;s greatest albums, while many hip hop fans have viewed it as Jay-Z&#x27;s best work.

In August 2019, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was released to digital and streaming platforms under Roc Nation&#x27;s independent label, Equity Distribution.

== Background ==
In 1989, aspiring rapper Jay-Z was recruited by mentor Jaz-O to appear on his song &quot;Hawaiian Sophie&quot;. He appeared on two more Jaz-O songs in the next year, but after Jaz-O was dropped from his record label, Jay-Z dealt drugs to support himself. He continued to pursue a rap career and appeared on two songs from Original Flavor&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Beyond Flavor&quot;. Jay-Z then caught Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s attention and toured with him; they collaborated on Kane&#x27;s 1994 posse cut &quot;Show &amp; Prove&quot; along with Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard, Wu-Tang affiliate Shyheim, Sauce Money, and Scoob Lover.

Despite the exposure he received from Kane, Jay-Z was still without a record deal. He began selling tapes from his car with help from friend Damon Dash. The success of his street-level marketing led to a deal with Payday Records, which released his first solo single, &quot;In My Lifetime&quot; and its B-side &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get wit Dat&quot;. In an unconventional move, Jay-Z then spurned the record contract he had long sought and left Payday Records to form his own label, Roc-A-Fella Records, with Damon Dash and Kareem &quot;Biggs&quot; Burke. Jay-Z later explained that he thought he could do a better job of marketing his records on his own:

Jay-Z rented a small, cheap office for Roc-A-Fella Records on John Street in one of the &quot;dreariest parts of the busiest city in the world&quot;. Jay-Z and his compatriots thought of their low-rent headquarters as a &quot;starting point&quot; that would eventually lead them to Manhattan. In 1995 and early 1996, Jay-Z appeared on records by Big L and Mic Geronimo, further raising his profile. At this point, he was still considered an &quot;underground&quot; rapper with a &quot;new jack&quot; style.

==Recording==
&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was recorded at D&amp;D Studios and mixed at Platinum Island, however, its beats were formed elsewhere. &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot; was produced by Knobody at his mother&#x27;s home in 1994, while the vocals were recorded on tour at a studio in Tampa Florida named Progressive Music with Mary J. Blige. Ski produced &quot;Feelin&#x27; It&quot; and &quot;Politics as Usual&quot; while recording with Camp Lo. The recording sessions were often competitive; Ski and Clark Kent created similar beats for &quot;Politics as Usual&quot;, but Ski submitted his to Jay-Z first causing his to appear on the album. &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; was a competitive, though friendly battle between Jay-Z and The Notorious B.I.G. in which Jay-Z tried proving that he is of Biggie&#x27;s caliber, while Biggie tried brushing his rhymes off as insignificant. Although the rappers had already met on the set for the &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; music video, they discovered that neither wrote down their rhymes while recording. The recording of &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot; spanned two months and moved from D&amp;D Studios to Giant Studios where the Clark Kent-sung chorus was recorded. Irv Gotti and Dame Dash noted that Nas was supposed to be featured on &quot;Bring It On&quot; and &quot;Can I Live&quot; but sessions for neither song ended up happening.

== Music and lyrics ==
An East Coast hip hop record, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was noted for having mafioso rap themes, with lyrics characterized by &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; as &quot;gritty realism&quot;. Writer dream hampton believed that although rappers had alluded to hustling before, Jay-Z &quot;talks about what it can do to a person&#x27;s inner peace, and what it can do to their mind&quot;. Jay-Z later said, &quot;the studio was like a psychiatrist&#x27;s couch for me&quot; while recording &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey described him as &quot;a street hustler from the projects who rapped about what he knew—and he was very, very good at it...detailing his experiences on the streets with disarming honesty&quot;. Huey summarizes the album&#x27;s subject matter saying:

AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier writes that the album&#x27;s production exhibits characteristics of &quot;the pre-gangsta era, a foregone era when samples fueled the beats and turntablism supplied the hooks&quot;, which &quot;sets &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; apart from Jay-Z&#x27;s later work&quot;. &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot; features a smooth beat. &quot;Politics as Usual&quot; has an R&amp;B sound and a sample of &quot;Hurry Up This Way Again&quot; by the Stylistics. &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; samples Nas&#x27; voice from &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; in its chorus. According to IGN&#x27;s Spence D., &quot;Ski brings back the stripped down piano fill style lending the track a late night jazz vibe&quot; on &quot;Feelin&#x27; It&quot;, and &quot;22 Two&#x27;s&quot; has a &quot;mournful jazz inclined groove&quot; that prominently features string instruments. &quot;Coming of Age&quot; contains a Clark Kent-produced beat that samples the melody and drums from &quot;Inside You&quot; by Eddie Henderson.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was met with widespread acclaim from music critics. Charlie Braxton of &quot;The Source&quot; praised Jay-Z for evolving &quot;from hip-hop sidekick to Mafia-style front man, blowing up the spot with vivid tales about the economic reality fueling what&#x27;s left of contemporary ghetto politics&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Dimitri Ehrlich commended him for rapping &quot;with an irresistible confidence, a voice that exudes tough-guy authenticity&quot;, also noting the &quot;unadorned but suitably militant&quot; production. Tonya Pendleton of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; stated that the album &quot;hits you with rap&#x27;s trends – Mary J. Blige riffs, Foxy Brown rhymes, Isley Brothers loops and more fashion info than Cindy Crawford&quot;, adding that &quot;his sassy way with a lyric transcends the material&quot; on the album.

===Retrospect===
&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; has often been considered by many fans to be Jay-Z&#x27;s best record. According to Birchmeier, it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking &quot;pop-crossover&quot; songs and hits. Shaheem Reid of MTV explained, &quot;&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; might not have the radio hits or club bangers of many of his other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical—and certainly at his most honest, according to him&quot;. Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;effortless, unaffected cool&quot; flow, and knack for &quot;writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time&quot;. According to Huey, this &quot;helped &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; rank as one of the finest albums of New York&#x27;s hip-hop renaissance of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Birchmeier, on the other hand, believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album&#x27;s reputation as a classic more so than Jay-Z. In a retrospective review for &quot;MSN Music&quot;, Robert Christgau said the album was &quot;designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it,&quot; finding it &quot;richer than any outsider could have known, and benefiting from everything we&#x27;ve since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where his mouth was. You can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was released by Roc-A-Fella on June 25, 1996, through a distribution deal with Priority. It was not an immediate success, reaching a peak position of 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with a sales total of 43,000 in its first week. It spent 18 weeks on the chart, and 55 weeks on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, on which it reached number 3. The album was promoted with the release of four singles, none of which reached the Top 40; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Nigga&quot; was the highest-charting single at number 50, &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; It&quot; did not peak higher than 70, and &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; did not chart altogether. By year end, the album had sold 420,000 copies.

On February 7, 2002, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of a million copies in the US. It remains the lowest charting album of Jay-Z&#x27;s career. According to &quot;Respect&quot; magazine, it had sold 1.5 million copies in the United States by 2006.

==Legacy and influence==
Since its initial reception, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; has received further acclaim from music critics and writers. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ryan Schreiber, it has often been &quot;considered one of hip-hop&#x27;s landmark albums&quot;, while Birchmeier said it was viewed like Nas&#x27; &quot;Illmatic&quot; (1994) as a classic hip hop album by a young rapper about their street and criminal experiences. &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; helped transfigure gangsta rap into mafioso rap, popularizing the subgenre and the imagery of high class, expensive lifestyles and tastes in hip hop, including drinking Cristal, driving Lexus automobiles, and living out the plots of films such as &quot;Scarface&quot; and &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;. In the opinion of Miles Marshall Lewis, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was a &quot;seminal&quot; work that &quot;shocked the world ... a personal touchstone for fans then Jay&#x27;s own age who were getting their own hustles on—hip hop&#x27;s young, gifted, and black&quot;. Jay-Z said that recreating &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; would be challenging, as he was living a different lifestyle with a completely different state of mind when he wrote the album.

&quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; was named one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time by &quot;The Source&quot; in 1998, &quot;Vibe&quot;, who ranked it seventh on their 2002 list, MTV.com, who ranked it sixth on their 2005 list, and About.com&#x27;s Henry Adaso; Adaso ranked it as the 14th greatest hip hop album, the second best rap record of 1996, and the fifth most &quot;essential&quot; hip hop album ever. &quot;Blender&quot; included &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; on the magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of &quot;500 CDs You Must Own Before You Die&quot;. That same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 248 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, number 250 on the 2012 revision, and the album&#x27;s rank shot up to number 67 on the 2020 reboot of the list. The magazine also named it the 17th best album of the 1990s. It was included in &quot;Vibe&quot;″s &quot;51 Essential Albums&quot; (2004), and &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot;″s &quot;The 100 Greatest Rap Albums 1995–2005&quot;.

In 2006, Jay-Z performed the songs from &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot; at the Radio City Music Hall to celebrate its tenth anniversary. The concert&#x27;s band included the Roots&#x27; drummer Questlove, the Illadelphonics, a 50-piece orchestra dubbed the Hustla&#x27;s Symphony and Just Blaze, the performance&#x27;s disc jockey. On &quot;Can&#x27;t Knock the Hustle&quot;, Beyoncé replaced Mary J. Blige, who was preparing for her Breakthrough Tour at the time. Jay-Z rapped the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s verses on &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s Finest&quot;, and Jaz-O&#x27;s verse was left out of &quot;Bring It On&quot;. Jay-Z added a verse to &quot;22 Two&#x27;s&quot; in which he says variations of the words &quot;for/four&quot; 44 times over the beat of &quot;Can I Kick It?&quot; by A Tribe Called Quest. Other alterations include Jay-Z changing a lyrical mention of Cristal to Dom Pérignon and Jay-Z&#x27;s band &quot;spruc[ing] up tracks like &#x27;Regrets&#x27; to add more energy&quot;. Celebrities such as Alicia Keys, Young Jeezy, Jadakiss, Chris Tucker, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony attended the concert. 3,000 tickets were put on sale; all were sold within two minutes according to Roc-A-Fella Records&#x27; website.

<doc id="319218" wikidata="Q762653" url="?curid=319218" title="Stillmatic">
<text>Stillmatic is the fifth studio album by American rapper Nas, released on December 18, 2001, by Ill Will and Columbia Records. In contrast to his previous work&#x27;s gangsta rap themes, the album contains socially conscious and philosophical themes similar to that of his 1994 debut &quot;Illmatic&quot;. Nas&#x27; lyrics address topics such as ghetto life, American politics, and his feud with rapper Jay-Z.

&quot;Stillmatic&quot; was a commercial and critical success and helped re-establish Nas&#x27; career, following a period of critical disappointment with his previous album &quot;Nastradamus&quot; (released in 1999). It debuted at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold over 342,600 in its first week of sales, eventually going on to sell over 2,026,000 copies in the United States. It has been certified Platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Background ==
Though he had gained critical acclaim with his classic debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot; in 1994, Nas&#x27; image had been quickly deteriorating in the hip-hop community with his change of theme, from the philosophical topics of &quot;Illmatic&quot; to the gangsta rap and commercialized sound that became the focus of his later albums. While his second album, &quot;It Was Written&quot; received positive reviews and introduced him to a greater audience, the follow-ups &quot;I Am...&quot; and &quot;Nastradamus&quot; were considered mediocre in comparison by critics. The release of &quot;Stillmatic&quot; was an attempt by Nas to reestablish his credibility in the hip-hop community, with the title signifying his intentions to continue where &quot;Illmatic&quot; left off.

=== Feud with Jay-Z ===
Jay-Z had previously dissed Nas in his song &quot;Takeover&quot;, taken from his September 2001 release, &quot;The Blueprint.&quot; On &quot;Stillmatic&quot;, Nas retaliated with the anticipated song, &quot;Ether,&quot; a response to &quot;Takeover&quot; which insinuated that Jay-Z had stolen lyrics from The Notorious B.I.G. several times, that he had sold out, and that he was a misogynist, among other things. Several hip-hop aficionados believe Nas won the feud based on this track, which many felt was much more vicious and ruthless than &quot;Takeover&quot;, although this is still a subject of debate within hip-hop circles. Jay-Z would respond with &quot;People Talkin&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know&quot;, &quot;Blueprint 2&quot; from &quot;The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse&quot; and the radio freestyle &quot;Supa Ugly.&quot;

== Singles ==
The first single from &quot;Stillmatic&quot; was &quot;Rule&quot; featuring R&amp;B singer Amerie. It was not heavily promoted but still managed to reach number 67 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. It did not receive a video and was issued on compact disc, so many are unaware that it was a single. &quot;Got Ur Self A...&quot; was believed to have been the first single from &quot;Stillmatic&quot;. &quot;Got Ur Self A...&quot;, produced by Megahertz, contains a sample from the theme song to the HBO crime drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The third single was &quot;One Mic&quot;, which received acclaim for its content and video.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Stillmatic&quot; was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 12 reviews.

&quot;The Source&quot; awarded the album a perfect &quot;five-mic&quot; rating, and &quot;Blender&quot; Alex Pappademas praised it as &quot;a surprising return to form&quot;. Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds said: &quot;&quot;Stillmatic&quot; isn&#x27;t merely a reunion or rehash of &quot;Illmatic&quot; themes. The Nas on this record has grown, with the emotional expansion such maturation suggests. For one, he has never before drawn upon his anger, with a burning focus and controlled intensity that underscores nearly every song. Some of it can surely be ascribed to the Jay-Z battle, but more seems due to the deeper, internal struggle Nas has waged against the fallout from his early, precocious success&quot;. Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; stated, &quot;diss songs aside, Nas&#x27; strength has always been his incisive lyrical analyses of current events.&quot; John Bush from AllMusic said: &quot;Dropping many of the mainstream hooks and featured performers in order to focus his rapping, Nas proves he&#x27;s still a world-class rhymer, but he does sound out of touch in the process of defending his honor. Despite the many highlights, a few of the tracks just end up weighing him down&quot;. Elizabeth Mendez Berry of &quot;Vibe&quot; called it &quot;infuriatingly inconsistent&quot; but also &quot;an exercise in lyrical courage and musical might&quot;.

Some reviewers were more critical. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Kathryn McGuire said: &quot;Striving to maintain street cred while reaching for pop success has left Nas vacillating clumsily on past projects, and this record is riddled with similar inconsistencies. One moment he casts himself as a gritty cat who feels most at home on a project bench, calling out neighborhood snakes (&#x27;Destroy and Rebuild&#x27;) and ducking gunshots (&#x27;One Mic&#x27;). The next, he&#x27;s delivering dumbed-down verses over the Track Masters&#x27; rinky-dink rendition of Tears for Fears&#x27; &#x27;Everybody Wants to Rule the World.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot; &quot;Consumer Guide&quot;, Robert Christgau found the release unworthy of a review and instead relegated it to a listing of ungraded &quot;duds&quot; in the column.

Retrospective appraisals have been relatively positive. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Chris Ryan wrote that &quot;Stillmatic&quot; &quot;finds Nas sticking with what works, creative storyraps and trenchant social commentary. He still errs when he makes attempts at club tracks, but the album is largely a success.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot;, Colin Larkin commended Nas for &quot;rebuilding his creative and commercial standing&quot; in the early 2000s with &quot;Stillmatic&quot;. In 2005, Chris Rock compiled a list of his Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all time, to which he ranked &quot;Stillmatic&quot; at number 20, commenting &quot;It&#x27;s like &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; eleven years earlier, where a guy just reclaimed his spot with some great records&quot;.

<doc id="319219" wikidata="Q244699" url="?curid=319219" title="Phetchaburi province">
<text>Phetchaburi (, ) or Phet Buri () is one of the western or central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Ratchaburi, Samut Songkhram, and Prachuap Khiri Khan. In the west it borders the Tanintharyi Division of Myanmar. Phetchaburi is home to Kaeng Krachan National Park.

==Geography==
Phetchaburi is at the north end of the Malay Peninsula, with the Gulf of Thailand to the east and the Tanaosi mountain range forming the boundary to Myanmar. Except for these border mountains most of the province is a flat plain. With an area of Kaeng Krachan National Park is Thailand&#x27;s largest national park, covering nearly half of the province. It protects mostly rain forests in the mountains along the boundary to Myanmar, but also the Kaeng Krachan Reservoir is part of the park. The total forest area is or 57.7% of provincial area. The only significant river of the province is the Phetchaburi River.

==History==

Originally, Phetchaburi was known as &quot;Pipeli&quot; (พลิพลี), or &quot;Pribpri&quot; (พริบพรี) as it used to be one of the southern kingdoms in Thai history alike to Tambralinga. Its name was recorded in De la Louère&#x27;s memo during the reign of King Narai in the middle of the Ayutthaya period.

Phetchaburi has been the location of multiple summer palaces commissioned by various kings. In 1860, King Rama IV built a palace near the city of Phetchaburi, commonly known as &quot;Khao Wang&quot;, but its official name is Phra Nakhon Khiri. Next to the palace the king built a tower for his astronomical observations. On the adjoining hill is the royal temple Wat Phra Kaeo. 

In 1910, King Rama V, constructed Phra Ram Ratchaniwet, now also known as Ban Puen Palace, slightly further south of Khao Wang. This was completed in the reign of King Rama VI, who also constructed Mrigadayavan Palace in 1923. in Cha-am district.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the Khao Wang palace in the background. In front are rice fields bordered by two coconut palm trees, symbolizing the major crops in the province.

The provincial tree is &quot;Eugenia cumini&quot;. Thai mahseer (&quot;Tor tambroides&quot;) is a provincial fish that is delicious and used to be found in the Phetchaburi River.

==Environment==
Phetchaburi&#x27;s shoreline on the Inner Gulf of Thailand in the area of Pak Thale consists of salt pans, mudflats, mangroves, and sand spits. It has been termed, &quot;...the premier bird watching site for shorebirds in Thailand...&quot; The 123-acre site provides sustenance for both passage and wintering species, as well as residents. The area hosts more than 7,000 waterbirds during the northern hemisphere winter. Economic development of the tidal flats, compounded by the impacts of climate change, threaten this ecosystem&#x27;s future. Several regular visitors are under threat, including the critically endangered Spoon-billed sandpiper and Great knot, Nordmann&#x27;s greenshank, and Far Eastern curlew.

==Economy==
Phetchaburi province is an important salt producer. In 2011, 9,880 rai worked by 137 families were devoted to salt production in Phetchaburi.

The province is known for its palm sugar (; ). It has more sugar palm trees than any other province. Producing sugar is a specialty of Ban Lat District in particular. It is a vital ingredient for the production of many Thai desserts such as Khanom mo kaeng etc. And that gave Phetchaburi the nickname &quot;city of desserts&quot;.

Tourism plays a significant role in the economy of Phetchaburi province. The province, however, has dropped from the fourth to the sixth most popular destination in Thailand due to coastal erosion, much of it in Cha-am District, caused by rising sea levels leading to &quot;deteriorating scenery&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), which are further divided into 93 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 681 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

Phetchaburi and Cha-am have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 69 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations – SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

Traditionally, they were used to decorate crematoriums during funerals, and Thai lacquer works etc.

==Tourism==
Hat Cha-am (หาดชะอำ) Appearing to have been frozen in time warp, midway between remaining a Thai-style resort, and modernising to meet international tastes and requirements, this extensive pine-fringed beach is considered to be one of the most popular beaches of Thailand.

Mrigadayavan Palace (พระราชนิเวศน์มฤคทายวัน) This beachside wooden palace was formerly used as a royal summer residence by King Rama VI during the 1920s. Facing the open sea, the palace is referred to as the palace of love and hope.

Phra Nakhon Khiri Historical Park (อุทยานประวัติศาสตร์พระนครคีรี) This covers a hilly area with an old palace and historical temples in the vicinity of the town. It consists of royal halls, temples and groups of buildings, constructed mostly in harmonious Thai, Western neoclassic and Chinese architectural styles.

Phra Ram Ratchaniwet Palace (พระรามราชนิเวศน์) also known as Ban Puen Palace (วังบ้านปืน) This palace was built by King Rama V in the German Art Nouveau Style. It is now located within Fort Ram Ratchaniwet and has a museum operated by the Royal Thai Army.

Wat Kamphaeng Laeng (วัดกำแพงแลง) This temple was originally a Khmer place of worship. It was later turned into a Buddhist temple and a shrine hall was constructed. However, the outlook of the place has not much changed due to the existence of sandstone walls and four Khmer style pagodas.

Hat Chao Samran (หาดเจ้าสำราญ) Legend says that King Naresuan the Great and King Eka Thotsarot made several royal visits here and highly appreciated its beauty. The villagers thus rendered it a name &quot;Hat Chao Samran&quot;, which means &quot;beach of royal leisure&quot;.

Hat Chomphon (หาดจอมพล) Another beach that is quiet therefore is especially suitable for those who like peace, located next to the southern part of Hat Chao Samran. It has a restaurant and a hotel. This beach is under the maintain of the Royal Thai Army (RTA), similar to Hat Suan Son Pradiphat of neighboring province Prachuap Khiri Khan. Its name meaning &quot;field marshal&#x27;s beach&quot;.

Chang Hua Man Royal Project (โครงการชั่งหัวมัน ตามพระราชดำริ) Royal agricultural project of the late King Rama IX, offering organic farm tours &amp; a restaurant. Initiated in 2009 on 250 rai (99 acres) of land, the Chang Hua Man Royal Project is an experimental farm where a range of experimental crops are being tested, not only to help the local people of the Phetchaburi area, but farmers throughout the country. Located in the area of Ban Nong Kho Kai, Khao Puk Sub-district, Tha Yang District.

Laem Phak Bia and Pak Thale (แหลมผักเบี้ยและปากทะเล) Large area of salt pans, mudflats, mangrove remnants and sand spit in Phetchaburi. This is without doubt the premier birdwatching site for shorebirds in Thailand, with large numbers of birds and many rare species appearing annually.

Whale Watching (ดูวาฬ) Duration from October to February coincides with the period of water compression (according to vernacular, &quot;water compression&quot; will take place during the time that tide in the Gulf of Thailand will spin out of Samut Songkhram and Phetchaburi provinces. Animals that are feed for whales would come out along). With any luck, it is possible to watch Bryde&#x27;s whales come out to find feed on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Going on a cruise for watching these whales with mouths fully open above the water surface to stalk prey (anchovies and krill) is an impressive experience. There are cruise service both at Hat Chao Samran and Laem Phak Bia piers.

Kaeng Krachan National Park (อุทยานแห่งชาติแก่งกระจาน) The largest national park in Thailand overlapping with Prachuap Khiri Khan province, was established in 1981. Just like other national parks, this place is full of wildlife. Kaeng Krachan National Park considered to be the place where wild elephants can be seen and most easily in the country.

*Kaeng lok: authentic curry of Phetchaburi province. It is a rare food that many people do not know, and even in the province itself, today there are only a few restaurants that are still cooked and sold.

<text>The 1 Broadway–Seventh Avenue Local is a rapid transit service in the A Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored , since it uses the Interborough Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s (IRT) Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

The 1 operates 24 hours a day between Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street in Riverdale, Bronx and South Ferry in Lower Manhattan, making all stops along the full route.

The modern 1 train has always run up to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, but its route below 96th Street has varied through the years. Initially, there were two main service patterns south of 96th Street: a local service to South Ferry in Manhattan, and an express service to Brooklyn. The express service was discontinued in 1959. From 1989 to 2005, the 1 ran in a skip-stop service pattern during rush hours, with the 9 providing the complementary skip-stop service on the same route. The 1 and 9 trains were rerouted after the September 11 attacks in 2001; although they had mostly resumed their normal route by 2002, the 1 train skipped the Cortlandt Street station until 2018.

==Service history==
=== Early service ===


When the New York City Subway began operation between 1904 and 1908, one of the main service patterns was the West Side Branch, which the modern 1 train uses. Trains ran from Lower Manhattan to the 242nd Street station near Van Cortlandt Park, using what is now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, 42nd Street Shuttle, and IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. There was both local and express service with express trains using the express tracks south of 96th Street. Some express trains ran to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn via the Joralemon Street Tunnel during rush hours while all other trains terminated at City Hall or the South Ferry outer loop.

On November 15, 1906, a petition with 20,000 signatures was sent to the Rapid Transit Commission to request the restoration of express service on the third track north of 96th Street. Residents of Inwood, Marble Hill, and Kingsbridge joined Washington Heights residents in requesting this service to speed their commutes. After receiving that petition, on November 16, the Rapid Transit Commission ordered the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) to extend express service from 96th Street to 137th Street in three days. Limited express service was inaugurated on November 19, 1906, operating daily, except Sundays and holidays, between 7:20 and 8:58 a.m. and 4:54 and 6:18 p.m. to and from 181st Street. Only expresses starting and ending at Kingsbridge would run express in this section; expresses from 168th Street would make local stops in this section. The Kingsbridge express trains would have two red signal markers on the top of the front motor car and a red lantern carried on the front end of the train on the center of the car platform. The previous schedule had local and express trains both running every four minutes south of Kingsbridge, while the new schedule had express trains running every eight minutes on the express track north of 96th Street, and local trains running every eight minutes. The number of local trains south of 96th Street did not change, with half of express trains becoming locals at this point. Waits at local stations north of 96th Street were ten minutes. In December 1906, the IRT prepared plans to relieve overcrowding on the platforms at 96th Street and train congestion at the station. To reduce the significant number of people transferring between people taking Lenox Avenue Line locals and Broadway express trains, the IRT planned to have Broadway express trains pass through the station without stopping. This would force people wanting to take Lenox Avenue Line trains to do so further down the line without needing to transfer, allowing trains to move through 96th Street more quickly.

In 1906, some of the local trains that started at 168th Street in the morning bypassed 157th Street without stopping.

On January 23, 1911, ten-car express trains began running on the Lenox Avenue Line, and the following day, ten-car express trains were inaugurated on the West Side Line.

On June 3, 1917, the first portion of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of Times Square–42nd Street (to 34th Street–Penn Station) opened. A separate shuttle service between Times Square and 34th Street was placed into service as well. On July 1, 1918, this shuttle was extended south to South Ferry, with a shorter shuttle on the Brooklyn branch between Chambers Street and Wall Street. Finally, the new &quot;H&quot; system was implemented on August 1, 1918, joining the two halves of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and sending all West Side trains south from Times Square. Local trains (Broadway and Lenox Avenue) were sent to South Ferry, while express trains (Broadway and West Farms) used the new Clark Street Tunnel to Brooklyn.

On January 16, 1928, the New York State Transit Commission announced that it had reached an agreement with the IRT to increase service on its lines by 8,000,000 car miles a year; the greatest increase since 1922. As part of the changes, on January 30, all 242nd Street trains started running to New Lots Avenue. This change eliminated the splitting of trains at Brooklyn Museum, with the first half going to New Lots Avenue and the second half to Flatbush Avenue. In addition, the span of rush hour service on both Broadway–Seventh Avenue locals and expresses was increased.

On January 25, 1931, the start time for southbound split train operation was changed from 1 p.m. to 9 a.m. passing Franklin Avenue in order to increase the frequency of service to Flatbush Avenue and New Lots Avenue from every sixteen minutes to every eight minutes.

As of 1934, all express 1 trains were running from 242nd Street to New Lots Avenue weekdays and Saturdays during the day, alternating between New Lots and Flatbush Avenues evenings and Sunday afternoons, and were split at Brooklyn Museum on Sunday morning with the first half going to New Lots Avenue and the second half to Flatbush Avenue. All local 1 trains ran from 137th Street (extended to Dyckman Street during rush hours) to South Ferry days and evenings, and 242nd Street to either New Lots or Flatbush Avenues during late nights (from midnight to 5:30 a.m.).

On September 5, 1937, the practice of splitting Sunday morning trains at Brooklyn Museum was discontinued, with the alternate trains going to New Lots Avenue or Flatbush Avenue. Trains were cut from being 10-car trains to 7-car trains. On July 1, 1938, all evening and Sunday trains were rerouted to New Lots Avenue. By 1945, all local 1 trains were cut back from Dyckman Street to 137th Street during peak periods.

Beginning on May 10, 1946, all 1 trains in Brooklyn ran express during late nights, with service running every twelve minutes. Previously all 1 trains ran local from 12:30 to 5:30 am and they alternated between Flatbush and New Lots Avenues. On December 20, 1946, all late night trains were routed to Flatbush Avenue, while Sunday service still alternated between Flatbush and New Lots Avenues.

The IRT routes were given numbered designations with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The first such fleet, the R12, was put into service in 1948. The Broadway route to 242nd Street became known as the 1.

On June 12, 1949, 137th Street to South Ferry Sunday local trains were discontinued, but were resumed on March 5, 1950, at which time Sunday service was also rerouted to New Lots Avenue. On March 15, 1954, weekend 137th Street to South Ferry local trains were once again discontinued, and simultaneously weekend Brooklyn trains were rerouted to Flatbush Avenue.

An attempt was made to extend express service further north on January 14, 1955, when Broadway express trains, or every other 1 train, began running express between 137th and 96th Streets in the peak direction, between 7:32 and 8:33 a.m. and between 5:10 and 5:59 p.m.. Express trains terminated at 242nd Street.

On January 17, 1955, the bottleneck at 96th Street forced some southbound 1 trains that ran express south of 96th Street to remain on the local track at 96th Street, skipping local stops before switching to the express track at 72nd Street.

Broadway express service between 137th and 96th Street proved unsuccessful, and ended on June 28, 1956. Meanwhile, in Brooklyn, weekday trains were rerouted to Flatbush Avenue and evening 137th Street to South Ferry local trains were discontinued.


=== West Side improvement ===
Under a $100-million rebuilding program, increased and lengthened service was implemented during peak hours on the 1 train. Trains then stopped using the switches north of 96th Street, except for General Orders, when temporary construction-related service diversions were in effect. Once most of the work on the project was completed on February 6, 1959, all 1 trains became local, running at an increased frequency, and all 2 and 3 trains became express, and eight-car local trains began operation. 1 trains began to run between 242nd Street and South Ferry at all times. Trains began to be branded as Hi-Speed Locals, being as fast as the old express service with new R21 and R22 subway cars on the route. During rush hours in the peak direction, alternate trains from 242nd Street only stopped at 168th Street while running express from Dyckman to 137th Streets in the direction of heavy traffic. The bypassed stations were served by locals originating from Dyckman Street. By May 26, 1959, 15,000 riders switched from using express trains to the Hi-Speed Locals during rush hours, increasing riders on local trains south of 96th Street by 75 percent.

Evening rush local/express service was discontinued on February 2, 1959. Morning rush hour express service was revised on January 8, 1962, with express trains stopping at 191st Street and 181st Street, and skipping 215th Street and 207th Street. This express service was discontinued on May 24, 1976, after which all 1 trains began to make all stops.

=== Skip-stop implementation ===
In April 1988, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) unveiled plans to speed up service on the Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line through the implementation of skip-stop service. As soon as the plan was announced, some local officials were opposed to the change. Initially, skip-stop service would have been operated north of 116th Street, with the 1 service skipping 125th Street, 157th Street, 207th Street, and 225th Street, and a new 9 service skipping 145th Street, 181st Street, Dyckman Street, 215th Street and 238th Street. As part of the study that resulted in the skip-stop plan, the NYCTA studied using the center track for express service. However, the agency settled on skip-stop service because the center track existed in two discontinuous segments, which would require complicated track-switching maneuvers to accommodate the express trains. Most passengers would not have to wait longer for a train: previously, one-third of 1 trains had terminated at 137th Street, but under the new service pattern these trains would run the full route to 242nd Street instead. Previously, stations north of 137th Street were served by a train every 10 minutes. At stations served by only one of the skip-stop services, the maximum wait was to be 10 minutes, while at stations served by all trains, the maximum wait would be 5 minutes. Skip-stop trains would not speed through stations, instead passing through skipped stops at ; the maximum allowed per NYCTA rules.

In July 1988, it was announced that the 1/9 skip-stop service would begin on August 29, 1988. Skip-stop service was expected to speed up travel times for almost half of riders north of 96th Street. In August 1988, the NYCTA postponed plans for 1/9 skip-stop service due to public opposition. NYCTA officials recognized that they did not do a good job informing the community, and indicated that they planned to continue to look into it. Plans to implement skip-stop service on the IRT Pelham Line (), which were contingent on the success of 1/9 skip-stop, were indefinitely postponed. In September 1988, the MTA Board formally voted to defer implementation of 1/9 skip-stop service for these reasons. NYCTA planned to initiate outreach in January 1989 and implement the change at some point later that year. In October 1988, the NYCTA informed local communities that it planned to implement skip-stop the following spring. However, residents of Inwood and Washington Heights were particularly opposed to the change, since most stops in these neighborhoods would be skipped by one of the two routes, and since they had not been included in the planning process.

In March 1989, the NYCTA stated that there was no set date for the implementation of the plan, with service possibly starting as late as the fall. To convince local communities, it set up meetings with residents and distributed leaflets advertising the change. In attempt to win their favor, they changed the name of the service from skip-stop to express service.

A public hearing on the NYCTA&#x27;s plan for skip-stop service was held on June 27, 1989. The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the 1, including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the 1 and the 9, and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either 1 or 9 trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional -minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.

On July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised 1/9 skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989. Unlike the original plan, 1 trains would skip 145th Street, 191st Street, 207th Street and 225th Street, while 9 trains would skip 157th Street, Dyckman Street, 215th Street and 238th Street.

Beginning at 6:30 a.m. on Monday, August 21, 1989, the services were coordinated as the 1/9 and both ran between Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street and South Ferry. The plan was to have skip-stop service begin north of 116th Street–Columbia University, but due to objections, most notably that riders did not want 125th Street to be a skip-stop station, skip-stop service was only implemented north of 137th Street–City College between the hours of 6:30 am and 7:00 pm weekdays. All 1 trains skipped Marble Hill–225th, 207th, 191st and 145th Streets, while all 9 trains skipped 238th, 215th, Dyckman and 157th Streets. On September 4, 1994, midday skip-stop service was discontinued, and 191st Street became a common station for skip-stop service.

=== 2000s to present ===

==== 9/11 and recovery ====
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, 1 trains had to be rerouted since the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line ran directly under the World Trade Center site and was heavily damaged in the collapse of the Twin Towers. It initially ran as a shuttle alongside the 2 and 3 trains to Times Square, due to debris that fell on the tracks south of Pennsylvania Station. When the debris was cleared by September 17, the 1 ran only between 242nd Street and 14th Street, making local stops north of 96th Street and express stops south of that point. Local service was replaced by the 2 and 3 trains, running express from Canal Street to Fulton Street due to debris covering the stops between them. The skip-stop service with the 9 train was suspended for the duration of the 9/11 emergency service plan. On September 19, after a few switching delays at 96th Street, service was changed. 1 trains made all stops at all times from 242nd Street to New Lots Avenue via the Clark Street Tunnel and IRT Eastern Parkway Line, replacing the route of 3 trains within Brooklyn, as the 3 terminated at 14th Street during this period. All 1 trains continued running express with the 2 between the aforementioned streets until October 1, when it terminated at Chambers Street in Manhattan overnight. Limited AM rush hour trains terminated at Flatbush Avenue instead of New Lots Avenue.

Over the next year, the section of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line&#x27;s South Ferry spur south of Chambers Street was cleaned and the tunnel was rebuilt through the World Trade Center site. The tunnel was completed and opened to service on September 15, 2002, when 1 trains returned to the South Ferry Loop and 9 skip-stop service was reinstated. However, the Cortlandt Street station, which was directly underneath the World Trade Center, was demolished as part of the clean-up and was rebuilt as part of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub until September 8, 2018, when it reopened as WTC Cortlandt.

==== Other changes ====

On April 27, 2004, it was announced that New York City Transit was considering eliminating 9 service, and thus, the skip-stop pattern. By that time, riders at skip-stop stations were experiencing longer wait times, and fewer riders were benefiting from the service pattern overall. The MTA estimated that eliminating skip-stop service only added to 3 minutes of travel time for passengers at the northernmost stations at 242nd Street and 238th Street, while many passengers would see trains frequencies double, resulting in decreased overall travel time because of less time waiting for trains. Though the MTA had planned to vote on the future of the skip-stop service in summer 2004, it approved the change on January 11, 2005. The 9 train was discontinued on May 27, 2005, and the 1 now makes all stops on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, replacing the original loop station. However, Hurricane Sandy flooded the station, requiring it to be shut down for repairs. Rector Street served as a temporary terminal for the 1 until April 4, 2013, when the 1 returned to the reopened loop station. The old loop station then served as a temporary terminal until the replacement South Ferry station reopened on June 27, 2017. In August 2023, weekend headways on the 1 were reduced from eight to six minutes. Effective December 15, 2024, two evening PM trains started terminating at 215th Street.

<text>Dakota Heights is an unincorporated community in Portage Charter Township, Houghton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is an enclave surrounded on all four sides by the extreme western part of the city of Houghton (on the fourth by Portage Lake (or, depending on the definition of terms, the Portage Lake Shipping Canal)); it is non-contiguous with any other part of Portage Township. (However, it was formerly served by the water lines of Adams Township.) Living in Dakota Heights is at least sometimes regarded as living &quot;in town&quot; (Houghton).
==History==
Dakota Heights was platted in 1906 and named after the Dacotah Mining Company, which operated briefly in its vicinity. It provided housing for workers on the Copper Range Railroad, which had a number of facilities immediately to the north; the company owned most of the housing. It remains &quot;primarily residential,&quot; though some businesses have opened (and closed) in it over the years, including a former motel, and currently a podiatrist&#x27;s office, restaurant spa, and bank.

==Geography==
Dakota Heights originally sat at the west end of Houghton&#x27;s Shelden Avenue. West of Dakota Heights was originally countryside, prior to the development of the M-26 corridor that began in the mid-1970s.

===Climate===
Dakota Heights has a humid continental climate but winters are typically long and snowy with much lake effect snow.

===Environmental issues===
Pollution in Huron Creek, arguably from inadequate private septic systems
 has contributed to the growth of algae.

==Education==
The local school district is Houghton-Portage Township Schools. Students K-12 are served by Houghton Elementary (K-5), Middle (6-8), and High (9-12) schools.Houghton-Portage Township Schools

The Rock School formerly served Dakota Heights and the surrounding area.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
In 1979 Highway M-26 was rerouted through the community, bisecting it. Park Avenue had formerly served as the main route from Houghton to Atlantic Mine, but this was replaced by the new route of the highway.

Houghton Motor Transit operates a demand bus that serves the community, but &quot;curb to curb&quot; services is only for Houghton residents, and as it is outside the city limits of Houghton rates with one terminus in Dakota Heights are higher. However, there are no regularly scheduled route buses operating in the community.

A snowmobile trail runs along Dakota Heights&#x27; Park Avenue.

<text>The verbal morphology of [[Armenian language|Armenian]] is complicated by the existence of two main dialects, Eastern and Western. The following sketch will be a comparative look at both dialects.

==Non-finite forms==

===Infinitive===
The infinitive of Armenian verbs is formed with the stem, the theme vowel, and the affix -լ (&quot;-l&quot;).

The endings reflect the number of conjugations possible. Western Armenian is conservative, retaining three conjugations in a, e, and i, while Eastern Armenian has collapsed I and II:

===Stems===
There are two main stems per verb, the present stem and past stem. For conjugations I/II, the past stem is identical to the present stem, which is basically the verb minus the theme vowel and ending:

The augment for the third conjugation is sometimes in -եց (-&quot;ec῾&quot;).

===Participles===
The number and type of participles varies by dialect.

====Future participle====
Both Eastern and Western Armenian form the common future participle in -լու (-&quot;lu&quot;). Western Armenian has one additional future participle in -լիք (-&quot;lik῾&quot;):

====Present and past participles====

=====Present=====
Eastern Armenian has three present participles, while Western Armenian has one. The two exclusively Eastern present participles are in -ում (-&quot;um&quot;) (for all verb classes) and -լիս (-&quot;lis&quot;); both affixes attach to the present stem. Eastern and Western Armenian have a common present participle -ող (-&quot;oġ&quot;), which attaches to the past stem; it is sometimes used as an agentive noun: ուսանող (&quot;usanoġ&quot; student) [fr. ուսանել &quot;usanel&quot; to study)].

=====Past=====
All affixes here attach to the past stem. Both dialects have a common past passive participle in -ած (WA -&quot;aj&quot;/EA -&quot;ac&quot;). Where the dialects differ is the past active participle. The Western Armenian participle is -եր (-&quot;er&quot;) for all conjugations, while Eastern Armenian has -ել (-&quot;el&quot;).

==Finite forms==

===Introduction: general overview===
Armenian features within its verbal system a system that encodes person and number, as well as tense, mood, and aspect (see following section for more.)

Armenian inherited from Indo-European two sets of synthetic affixes corresponding roughly to a &quot;present&quot; or general series, and a past series:

How these affixes are used varies between the two modern dialects of Armenian.

===Tense/mood/aspect===
Both dialects have five moods: indicative, conditional, optative/subjunctive, necessitative, imperative; of these only the imperative has no tense distinction. The number of tenses varies by dialect. Aspect is divided roughly the same in both dialects, but the distribution is slightly different.

====Indicative mood====
Both Eastern and Western feature one present, one future, and two past tenses (imperfect, preterite). Their formation varies by dialect.

=====Present=====
Formation of the present tense differs between Eastern and Western. In form, the present indicative of Eastern Armenian has no corresponding Western formation. However, the &quot;Western&quot; present indicative is formed identically to the &quot;Eastern&quot; present conditional.

Eastern Armenian uses the -ում (&quot;-um&quot;) participle with the present tense of Eastern Armenian verb լինել (&quot;linel&quot; &quot;to be&quot;). Western Armenian uses a synthetic general form of the verb preceded by the particle կը &quot;gë&quot; /gə/. The synthetic form conjugates according to the verb&#x27;s theme vowel (i.e., &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, or &quot;a&quot;).

*In Armenian, final /j/ in polysyllabic words is silent.

=====Imperfect=====
The formation of the imperfect is similar to the present-tense formation in both dialects. Eastern Armenian uses the -ում (&quot;-um&quot;) participle with the imperfect of verb լինել (&quot;linel&quot; &quot;to be&quot;). Western Armenian uses a synthetic imperfect form of the verb preceded by the particle կը &quot;gë&quot; /gə/.

Note that in all forms, Eastern and Western, that feature the combination էի (e.g., սիրում էիմ/կը սիրէիմ, etc.), there is an epenthetic yod: sirum ēi or ; &quot;gë sirēi&quot; .

=====Future=====
Like the formation of the present tense, the future tense in Armenian intersects two varying constructions with opposite meanings. The Eastern future tense is made with the future participle in -լու (&quot;-lu&quot;) with the present tense of verb լինել (&quot;linel&quot;). (This Eastern form is identical to the Western Armenian non-past necessitative (see below.)) The Western future tense is made with the general synthetic verb preceded by the particle պիտի (&quot;bidi&quot;). (This Western form is identical to the Eastern Armenian non-past necessitative (see below.))

Note that in all Eastern forms that feature the combination ու + ե (e.g., կարդալու եմ, etc.), epenthetic yod appears: &quot;kardalu em&quot; or .

=====Preterite=====
In various grammars, this is called the preterite, the perfect, or sometimes the aorist. Both Eastern and Western Armenian use a synthetic preterite, which is formed by deleting the infinitive marker and theme vowel, then:
&lt;br&gt;· Class I and II verbs (in both dialects) add -եց (-&quot;ec῾&quot;);
&lt;br&gt;· Class III verbs add -աց (-&quot;ac῾&quot;).

The preterite affixes are similar to the imperfect endings of the verb &quot;to be&quot; (Eastern լինել &quot;linel&quot;, Western ըլլալ &quot;ëllal&quot;)

In Class III verbs (&quot;a&quot;-thematic verbs), the preterite stem and the past stem are identical.

====Optative mood====
The optative mood (called the subjunctive in some grammars) in Armenian is identical in both dialects. There are two tenses: non-past (present, etc...) and past (perfect, etc. ...).

=====Non-past=====
The non-past optative is the simple &quot;present&quot; conjugated form, as compared to other Indo-European languages:

1Historically, verbs of the third conjugation ended in final յ, which in traditional orthography is silent in word final position. Due to spelling reforms conducted in the earliest 20th century, final յ is missing from the Eastern conjugation

=====Past=====
The past optative is the simple &quot;imperfect&quot; conjugated form, as compared to other Indo-European languages:

1
In both dialects, the combinations եի and էի are pronounced as though spelt &quot;եյի&quot; and &quot;էյի&quot;, meaning that սիրեի and սիրէի are both pronounced . The latent yod &quot;յ&quot; is written and pronounced in class III verbs.

====Conditional mood====

The conditional is mostly similar in both dialects.

In Eastern Armenian, the non-past conditional is formed by affixing կ- before the non-past optative. With this formation, Eastern Armenian also has a past conditional with &quot;k- &quot; plus past optative. Due to phonological restrictions, կ is pronounced before another consonant: կկարդա (&quot;He would read&quot;); կկարդային (&quot;They would have read&quot;&#x27;).

Western Armenian does the same, but it has another form identical to its Future in the Past (for the past conditional). The former has always been more prevalent, while the latter is falling in disuse.

The Eastern conditional forms, with slight orthographic variation, are identical to the Western present and imperfect indicative forms:

The second (less prevalent) Western Armenian conditional is identical to the Eastern Past Necessitative.

====Imperative mood====

1Optional spoken forms

In both Eastern and Western Armenian, the imperative consists of the affirmative and the negative, and singular and plural forms (based on the second person &quot;you&quot;).

====Necessitative mood====

Both dialects have what is known as the necessitative mood (also found in Turkish). Both dialects have a past and a non-past necessitative. Eastern Armenian forms its necessitative by adding particle &quot;piti&quot; before the optative forms. Western Armenian forms its necessitative with the &quot;lu&quot; future participle plus the forms of &quot;әllal&quot; (to be)

Note that the EA particle &quot;piti&quot; is orthographically identical to the Western particle &quot;bidi&quot;, meaning that the Eastern necessitative forms are identical in form to the Western future indicative and conditional. Also note that the Western necessitative forms correspond to Eastern future indicative (and future perfect (see below)):

====Voice====
Armenian has two voices: Active and Passive.

All the forms above are Active. To make them passive, add the identifying letter վ in front of the ending.

=====Present and past perfect=====

Note: In Western Armenian, the present perfect and past perfect have two forms. One is formed by the past active participle and the verb to be (սիրեր եմ), while the other uses the more prevalent past (passive) participle (սիրած եմ). The first may denote the mediative (evidential or non evidential), the inferential, or the reportative. The second is more akin to the Eastern Perfect and the resultative.

The present perfect is formed with the &quot;l&quot;-past participle plus the present form of լինել (&quot;linel&quot; &quot;to be&quot;). The past perfect (pluperfect) is the l-past participle plus the imperfect of &quot;linel&quot;.

=====Future perfect (future in the past)=====

The Eastern future perfect (future in the past) indicative is formed like the future indicative tense (using the &quot;lu&quot;-participle), substituting the present forms of the verb լինել &quot;linel&quot; with the imperfect.

In Western Armenian, it is identical to the imperfect, substituting կը with պիտի.

This tense is used with events which were most likely to happen, which were to happen, according to the speaker&#x27;s firm conviction, but they either haven&#x27;t happened, or it&#x27;s not known.

<doc id="319232" wikidata="Q126698" url="?curid=319232" title="42nd Street Shuttle">
<text>The 42nd Street Shuttle is a New York City Subway shuttle train service that operates in Manhattan. The shuttle is sometimes referred to as the Grand Central/Times Square Shuttle, since these are the only two stations it serves. The shuttle operates during daytime hours only, with trains running on two tracks underneath 42nd Street between Times Square and Grand Central; for many decades, three tracks had been in service until a major renovation was begun in 2019 reducing it to two tracks. With two stations, it is the shortest regular service in the system by number of stops, running about in 90 seconds . The shuttle is used by over 100,000 passengers every day, and by up to 10,200 passengers per hour during rush hours.

The 42nd Street Shuttle was constructed and operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and is part of the A Division of New York City Transit . The shuttle tracks opened in 1904 as part of the city&#x27;s first subway. The original subway line ran north from City Hall on what is now the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to 42nd Street, from where it turned west to run across 42nd Street. At Broadway, the line turned north, proceeding to 145th Street on what is now the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. This operation continued until 1918, when construction on the Lexington Avenue Line north of 42nd Street, and on the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line south of 42nd Street was completed. One trunk would run via the new Lexington Avenue Line down Park Avenue, and the other trunk would run via the new Seventh Avenue Line up Broadway. The section in the middle, via 42nd Street, was converted into shuttle operation.

Through the 20th century, various attempts to convert, replace, or extend the shuttle have failed. The proposals have included conveyor-belt systems, as well as reconstruction of connections to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue and Lexington Avenue lines. One of the shuttle&#x27;s trains was outfitted with automatic train operation on a trial basis in 1962, although the trial ended after a fire in 1964. A major reconstruction of the shuttle took place between 2019 and 2022. The reconstruction allowed trains to be lengthened to six cars while also expanding both shuttle stations&#x27; capacity, and brought the shuttle into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

The shuttle does not operate overnight, and each of the shuttle tracks in operation at any given time is independent of the other. Its route bullet is colored on route signs, station signs, and rolling stock with the letter &quot;S&quot; on the official subway map.

== History ==

===Creation and early years===

The subway through which the shuttle runs was opened on October 27, 1904, by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the first day of subway service in Manhattan. The current shuttle line was part of the first IRT subway line, which ran north to 145th Street via Broadway and south to City Hall via Park Avenue and Lafayette Street. The 42nd Street section of the line connected Broadway at Times Square, on the west, to Park Avenue at Grand Central Terminal, on the east. At the Times Square end of this segment, the line curved sharply to the north under One Times Square, swinging northeast under Seventh Avenue before shifting under Broadway. The platforms at Times Square are located on this curve. Like the rest of the Original Subway, the line was built with a vertical clearance of , and a total width of . The maximum grade of the line is 1.0 percent between Sixth Avenue and Broadway. In 1910, the platforms at the two stations were extended.

In 1913, the IRT, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit, and the city agreed to the Dual System of Rapid Transit to expand the city&#x27;s transportation. As part of the agreement, the existing IRT subway would be split into two north–south lines and a shuttle along 42nd Street. The section of the line south of Grand Central–42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line stretching from 41st Street and Park Avenue to the Bronx, running via Lexington Avenue, while the section of the line north of Times Square–42nd Street would be connected to a newly constructed line heading south under Seventh Avenue. The section along 42nd Street was left as a shuttle to connect the new East Side and West Side Lines.

The new Lexington Avenue route curved off of the old line at 41st Street and ran underneath private property to reach Lexington Avenue at 43rd Street with a new Grand Central station located in the diagonal segment. Since there was 400 feet between the eastern end of the original line&#x27;s station and the new Lexington Avenue Line station, a new shuttle station was to be built near the Lexington Avenue Line station. The construction of the narrow island platform station required building two new trackways extending east under 42nd Street. The two-track layout was expected to provide ample capacity for the shuttle. On August 1, 1918, the Dual System&#x27;s &quot;H system&quot; was put into service, with through trains over the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and only shuttle trains under 42nd Street. The station was not ready in time, and therefore wooden flooring was temporarily laid over sections of the trackways at Times Square and Grand Central. The shuttle was heavily used, and the crowding conditions were so bad that the shuttle was ordered closed the next day by the Public Service Commission.
The new, unused trackways of the planned station were covered with flooring and turned into a passageway between the Shuttle and Lexington Avenue stations. The shuttle reopened on September 28, 1918, with improved passageways and platforms. Track 2 at the Grand Central station was covered over by a wooden platform. A &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist later said that former southbound express track 2 was still usable for the first few hours of the shuttle&#x27;s operation, but the wooden platform was placed over that track later the same day to allow shuttles to use former northbound express track 3, due to high demand for the shuttles on the former local tracks, numbered 1 and 4. On the walls of the stations, black bands (at Times Square) and green bands (at Grand Central) were painted to guide passengers to the shuttle platforms. The shuttle was meant to be &quot;temporary,&quot; and by 1922, there were proposals for the shuttle to be replaced by a moving sidewalk.

On March 14, 1927, the extension of the IRT Flushing Line from Fifth Avenue to Times Square under 41st Street was completed and opened for operation. The extension was expected to significantly reduce overcrowding on the shuttle, and on its first night of operation, it reduced shuttle ridership by 50%. Crowding was expected to be reduced further as riders became familiar with the extension. In 1921, of the 100,000 daily shuttle riders, 25,000 transferred to the Flushing Line (then called the Queensboro subway). Originally, plans for the Flushing Line called for the use of two of the four tracks between Times Square and Grand Central for the new line, and the other two for shuttle service.

=== Proposed improvements ===
Throughout the history of the shuttle there have been proposals to improve service on the line and to extend the line both to the east and to the west. However, it is not feasible to extend the line in either direction, as the line is at the same level as the tracks of the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and those of the Lexington Avenue Line. There have been several proposals to replace the line with moving walkways or conveyor belts. In 1923, H.S. Putnam proposed to replace the shuttle with an endless moving platform system. There would have been three platforms with speeds of , and . The fastest platform was to have been installed with seats. Even though the plan was supported by the Chief Engineer of the New York City Rapid Transit Commission, it was not adopted. In 1930, Charles E. Smith, vice president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, proposed allowing trains from the Broadway–Seventh Avenue and Lexington Avenue Lines to use the shuttle tracks for through service, as well as discontinuing shuttle service. This also was not carried out.

On February 12, 1946, work began to double the width of the passageway connecting the shuttle platforms at Grand Central and the main mezzanine over the Lexington Avenue Line platforms. As part of the work, the wooden passenger walkway, which had an average width of was replaced by a wide passageway with concrete flooring. This walkway had been &quot;temporary&quot; when it was put into place in August 1918. The new -long passageway covered most of the trackways used by downtown trains of the Original Subway prior to 1918. The iron railings along the planked walkway were removed. The project cost $45,800 and was intended to ease congestion. As part of the project, the upper passageway was moved to within fare control to allow passengers to go between the subway mezzanine and the entrance to Grand Central Terminal at the shuttle without paying a fare. This was accomplished by moving the turnstiles at the eastern end of the passageway. In March, members of the Metallic Lathers Union Local 46 sought to halt construction on the project, which was 80 percent complete, as the union objected to having the work done by city employees who made less than union workers. The rebuilt passageway opened on March 18, 1946.

On June 21, 1949, William Reid, the Chairman of the New York City Board of Transportation, announced that his capital budget request for 1950 would include $3.5 million to improve the shuttle for the first time since it was created. As part of the project, double platforms would have been constructed at both ends of the shuttle, the abandoned track 2 would have been removed, and switches would have been installed on track 3 to allow trains to pull into either platform on either track 1 or track 3. In addition, the shuttle would have been extended to the east to shorten transfers to the Lexington Avenue Line. Chairman Reid also stated that he would look for ways to improve service for riders before any funding arrived, noting that a way was needed to get riders to the proper platform before the car doors closed. While there were lights giving the number of the platform for the next train, they did not give passengers enough time to get to the train before their doors closed.

On October 28, 1953, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) asserted that it was impossible for its members to follow the schedule of the shuttle, which called for a train every two minutes during rush hours. Its president, Michael Quill, said that if the New York City Transit Authority took action against train crews skipping scheduled runs, there would be unrest among the TWU&#x27;s members.

Between 1948 and 1951, the Stephens–Adamson Manufacturing Company and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company proposed that the shuttle be replaced by a pedestrian conveyor system called &quot;Carveyor&quot;. The &quot;Carveyor&quot; would have consisted of a set of wheelless cars running on conveyor belts. They would have run slowly–at speeds of –in stations and would have run more quickly–at speeds of –between stations. 12 cars would move along the conveyor belt, and each car would have held 12 seated and 5 standing passengers. The system was expected to travel between Grand Central and Times Square in 1 minute 15 seconds, and was expected to move 18,000 passengers per hour as opposed to the 12,000 that could be accommodated by the existing shuttle. This proposal was formally presented to the Board of Transportation in March 1951. Even though New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) and the Board of Estimate approved the plan it was not completed due to union opposition and high cost.

On April 21, 1953, Board of Transportation Chairman Sidney H. Bingham, announced that the installation of the conveyor would cost $3.8 million and could be completed in 18 months after funding was budgeted for the project. He hoped that the city and Federal Government would each foot 25% of the bill, with the remaining 50% to come from the State. Funding for the project was included in the 1953 and 1954 capital budgets. On October 19, 1954, the single bid for the project was submitted by Passenger Belt Conveyors, which was a subsidiary formed the previous month by Stephens–Adamson Corporation and Goodyear Tire. The project was expected to be completed in 550 days. The cost of the project was expected to increase to $5.5 million to pay for additional structural changes needed for the new system. On November 4, 1954, the $3,881,000 contract for a modified version of the plan was awarded. The &quot;New York Times&quot; lauded the plan, stating that &quot;the Times Square–Grand Central subway shuttle was an atrocity from the beginning and has had no substantial improvement in a third of a century.&quot; Bids on the structure to accommodate the conveyor, which was expected to cost $1.1 million, were to be received on December 10, 1954. The contract required the approval of the New York City Board of Estimate, but never received it. In May 1955, it was announced that the project was tabled for discussion for August 25 of that year at the request of City Controller Lawrence Gerosa, who considered the plan to be dangerous. He hoped to convince the Board of Estimate to scrap the project. On September 15, 1955, the Chairman of the New York City Transit Authority, which had taken over operations of the Board of Transportation in June 1953, said that the allocation of funds for the project was questionable. On October 20, 1955, the NYCTA told the Board of Estimate that it was rescinding its request for $4,991,000 to build the conveyor. The plan was canceled due to its high cost.

In 1954, NYCTA created a design concept to reconfiguring the shuttle onto a tangent alignment under 42nd Street. This design was never executed because of the significant impact it would have had on utilities and the street above, and because it would have required a full shutdown of the station.

On August 16, 1954, a project to replace 1,000 incandescent bulbs with of new fluorescent lighting at Grand Central platform was completed. The new lighting fixtures replaced the green and red lines of light bulbs that had indicated the way to and from the shuttle, respectively, and lit up signs directing riders to the shuttle, with additional fixtures to direct riders from the shuttle to be installed in two weeks. In addition to replacing platform lighting, lighting was replaced to the mezzanine. This project, which cost $440,000, was the beginning of a program to improve lighting at old stations across the IRT system.

===1960s: Automation test===

==== Testing and operation ====
As part of a demonstration for automation, track 4 was briefly automated from 1962 to 1964. It was the first automated service in the New York City subway system. On January 26, 1959, the Chairman of the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), Charles Patterson announced that the NYCTA was exploring converting the shuttle to pilot automatic operation. If the pilot were successful, the rest of the system could be converted to automatic operation in phases. The automatic system would make use of existing tracks, platforms and rolling stock with minor modifications. The project would cost $1 million, and Patterson said that automating the shuttle would save $150,000 annually by reducing 25 train operators and conductors. If the whole system were automated, 90% of the 3,100 train operators, and 75% of the conductors and platform conductors could be eliminated.

Starting in December 1959, the fully automatic train, consisting of three cars, was tested on of one of the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks (E4) between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train was equipped with a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the train&#x27;s starting, acceleration, braking, and stopping, as well as the opening and closing of the car doors. The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a punched tape. At full speed, the train ran at , slowing to when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the tripper arms would stay upright and the train&#x27;s brakes would automatically be set. The equipment was built and installed by the General Railway Signal Company and the Union Switch and Signal division of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, after several years of research and development. The NYCTA contributed between $20,000 to $30,000 on the project, while the bulk of it, between $250,000 and $300,000, was contributed by the two companies. The automation of the shuttle was opposed by the president of the Transport Workers Union, Michael J. Quill, who pledged to fight the project and called the device &quot;insane&quot;. A June 1961 report from the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) mentioned the automatic train was planned to be placed into service that November.

On February 29, 1960, the NYCTA began to test a new tieless roadbed on track 1, which had been installed since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, the rest of the tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The setup included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto&#x27;s subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on track 1.

In the afternoon of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. Tape recorded messages warned passengers that the doors of the train were closing. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, the Myrtle Avenue Elevated, the BMT Canarsie Line, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.

==== Demise ====
On April 16, 1964, an automated train derailed on the northernmost track east of Times Square during the morning rush hour, causing a short circuit, and thus, suspending service on all three tracks.

A severe fire at the Grand Central station on April 21, 1964, destroyed the demonstration train and resulted in the subsequent restoration of manual operations. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of track 3 was delayed because of the need to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.

From September 19, 1966, to April 1967, service on the shuttle was limited in order to allow for the reconstruction of parts of the line. The entire project cost $419,000 and included the construction of a new mezzanine at Grand Central and the replacement of the wooden platform at Times Square with a new concrete one of . As part of the project, the tiles damaged by the smoke from the fire were replaced with tiles in the city&#x27;s colors of blue, white and orange, with black tiles interspersed. In addition, fluorescent lighting, which was 12 times brighter than the old lighting, was installed.

===1980s–2000s===
In 1978, the United States Department of Transportation undertook a study to analyze and determine the feasibility of installing an Accelerating Walkway System in an urban environment. The study used the 42nd Street Shuttle as a case study. The two options the study analyzed were a one-directional reversible linear walkway and a bi-directional loop. The study found that the walkways would provide a better level of service during off-peak hours and a similar level of service during peak hours. It was estimated that it would cost between $5.4 million and $13 million to install the system.

On October 3, 1987, ten R62s made their debut on the shuttle, replacing the R17s that previously ran on the shuttle. In June 1992, these were replaced by R62As.

On November 17, 1988, the NYCTA announced plans to drop $343 million of projects from its Capital Program, including $23 million allocated for the reconfiguration of the Shuttle. The shuttle would have been rebuilt with two tracks and the platforms at Times Square would have been moved closer to other subway lines. Work was to begin in 1991, but was deferred so it could be done in conjunction with other rehabilitation work at Times Square, which was delayed.

The shuttle ran at all times until September 10, 1995, when night service was discontinued in order to avoid raising fares, meaning that late-night passengers had to use the train. New York City Transit had been expecting a $160 million surplus in 1995, but due to reductions in state and Federal contributions, it was left with a deficit expected to reach $172 million. The elimination of late night service was part of a larger plan to reduce spending in order to avert a fare increase, which Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani had pressured the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to avoid. Eliminating night service on the shuttle was done to avoid the need to reduce service on corridors without alternate service. Shuttle service had been running every ten minutes overnight, and was used by 275 passengers per hour.

On February 28, 2005, a shuttle train crashed into the bumper block of track 3 at Grand Central, injuring the train operator and hospitalizing two passengers. The crash caused $100,000 in damage to the 4-car train. The New York State Public Transportation Safety Board&#x27;s investigation into the collision concluded that the most likely cause of the accident was the train operator falling asleep while operating the train, which led to his overrunning the stop sign and colliding into the bumper block.

===Reconstruction===
==== Planning ====
In 1998, MTA officials announced that the Times Square station would be renovated and that the entire complex would become compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The project was to be split into two phases, each lasting four years; the renovation of the 42nd Street Shuttle platforms would occur during the second phase of renovations. However, the curved platforms at Times Square made it very difficult to convert to ADA standards, and the shuttle platform renovation project was delayed. Although planning was completed in 2006, the project was delayed due to a lack of funding.

In 2014 and 2015, the MTA commissioned WSP to undertake constructibility and feasibility studies to increase capacity on the shuttle and to make it ADA-accessible. NYCT called for a plan that would include a wider center platform to accommodate two six-car trains to the east of the existing station. WSP developed a plan that allowed the shuttle to be reconstructed without any need to excavate along 42nd Street. The initial study, TO-1, only called for the elimination of 36 columns along platform edges to align with train doors, and for the elimination of 20 columns in the concourse area. This plan would have kept the remaining platform columns, which are located every . NYCT considered using platform screen doors to separate trains from the platforms. NYCT then asked WSP to engage in a study, TO-3, to look into eliminating all platform edge columns while keeping the station open with minimal impacts.

==== Funding and approval ====
Initially, $1 million in funding for a study to develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle was included in the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program. However, this study was removed from the program in the July 2017 amendment to the Capital Program.

Funding for the renovation of the Times Square shuttle platforms and the reconfiguration of the shuttle was provided as part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program. Improving access to Times Square will cost $28.93 million, while the reconfiguration project will cost $235.41 million. The contract for the construction of the project was originally scheduled to be awarded in June 2018. However, this was delayed by several months because of changes to the project schedule and cost. The construction duration was expected to be extended by three months, and the cost would increase by $25 million, because of additions to the original construction plan. A construction contract was awarded on March 7, 2019, with an estimated completion date of March 2022. The project is expected to take three years to complete. On August 2, 2019, the MTA announced that work on the project would begin on August 16.

Work on the project will be completed in multiple phases, which were originally intended to create minor reductions in service, since only one track at a time would be taken out of service for construction. During the first phase of work, service operated on tracks 1 and 4. The second phase of work began on October 6, 2019, with service being limited to tracks 3 and 4. During this phase, only three of the four cars of the train on track 3 were available for use. On November 8, 2019, the MTA solicited bids for a consultant to manage, oversee, and coordinate work on construction projects taking place in the subway system between Times Square and Grand Central, in order to improve customer communication, minimize inconveniences, and to reduce the length and cost of these projects by bundling work. In January 2020, the MTA announced that it would package work on eight projects along 42nd Street, including the work to renovate the 42nd Street Shuttle, together into the newly branded 42nd Street Connection Project. The new approach was expected to reduce the time needed to complete renovations on the shuttle from 49 months to 36 months, allowed for the reengineering of project scope to reduce cost overruns, and improved the schedule of subway service during work. In February, work began on surveying the area that will be the new connection between the Times Square and Bryant Park stations.

On April 6, 2020, a new phase of work on the project was scheduled to begin, with service then only running on tracks 1 and 3. However, on that date, New York City Transit issued a General Order that called for a complete shutdown of the line until December 31, 2020. Because the shuttle was already temporarily shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the upgrades were expedited by two months. These upgrades included work laying new trackbed and track, and improvements in drainage and flood mitigation systems. The closure of the shuttle allowed the contractor to fix an unexpected tunnel settlement condition at Times Square, which would have otherwise delayed the project by three to four months.

Despite the General Order, the shuttle reopened on August 10, 2020, to accommodate passengers displaced by unrelated construction on the Lexington Avenue Line, which caused a partial closure of that line. At midnight on November 7, 2020, another phase of work on the project began as track 3 was taken out of passenger service. Shuttle service on track 4 resumed on November 9. As part of this phase of work, track 3 and its infrastructure was removed to allow for the construction of new platforms. In addition, structural work, and new power and signaling systems will be completed, and work will also begin on the new transfer passageway between the Times Square and Bryant Park stations. As of December 2020, work on the project was 55 percent complete. In preparation for the opening of the new platform, weekend service ran on a single track during July and August 2021, and the shuttle was closed for four days in July and twelve days in August and September 2021. The new platforms finally opened on September 7, 2021.

==== Components ====

As part of the project, the 42nd Street Shuttle became ADA-accessible, and track 3 was removed, reducing the shuttle from three to two tracks. As part of the project, train reliability will be improved with the installation of a new signal system, replacing the existing system, which dates back to the 1930s. The new signaling system will not use communications-based train control (CBTC), but will be CBTC-ready.

The shuttle now runs with two six-car trains, compared to the two three-car trains used for tracks 1 and 4, and the one four-car train used on the former track 3, increasing capacity by 20 percent, from 100 cars of capacity per hour to 120 per hour. Times Square and Grand Central stations were reconfigured with wide island platforms, and access improvements will be completed at Times Square. Certain features of the Times Square station would be repaired and restored, and to increase capacity, 122 spaced columns between the trackways and 11 mezzanine columns were removed and replaced by 45 new spaced columns that are at least two feet away from the platform edges for safety and to provide space for tactile warning strips. These columns will be supported by 45 new foundations. A plaque describing the history of the station was installed underneath the replicated Knickerbocker lintel.

At Times Square, a new and platform was built atop the trackways of tracks 2 and 3, the former express tracks of the original subway. The platform will extend to the east, and will be flanked by track 1 on the south and track 4 on the north. Passengers at Times Square are no longer able to board trains on track 1 from the south, as the track would be cut back a few hundred feet to the east, and as a portion of the area used for boarding will be used for the reconfiguration of the fare control area for the entrance leading to the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway. Passengers are also no longer able to board trains on track 4 from the north; extending the platform to the east allowed for the abandonment of the platform currently serving trains on track 4, which is on a very sharp curve and has gap fillers to bridge a large gap between the platform and trains. This platform will be converted into employee space. The exit to 43rd Street was closed, covered over, and turned into an emergency exit starting on October 19, 2019, allowing the metal bridge over track 4 to access the exit to be removed, which in turn will eliminate the need to remove the bridge every time a train on track 4 needed to be removed from service. As a result of the changes, dwell times will slightly be reduced at Times Square.

As part of the redevelopment of One Times Square, a new entrance with a glass canopy will be built. A new elevator to the building&#x27;s observation deck will be installed and maintained by Jamestown Developers. The entrance will replace the exit to 43rd Street and will lead to the west side of Broadway between 42nd Street and 43rd Street, as well as a previously closed exit to the northeastern corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue. The space currently used by passengers heading to and from the 43rd Street exit or to and from trains on track 4 will be placed outside of fare control for this new entrance. The portion of the existing station to the west of this new control area will no longer be accessible to passengers. To the west of the end of the platform on track 4, a wall decorated by artwork will be installed, blocking the view of the connection between track 4 and the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

A new underpass at the eastern end of the new platform was originally planned to be constructed. This underpass was to pass under track 4 and lead to an existing easement passageway in the basement of the Bank of America Tower. A new fare control area was to be constructed at the west end of the passageway, leading to a new entrance on the north side of 42nd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue. The passageway was to be used for a free transfer to the IND Sixth Avenue Line&#x27;s 42nd Street–Bryant Park station, allowing passengers access to the B, D, F, and M trains. The underpass was to be mined below track 4, and trains running on the track would have been supported by micropiles and skeletonized track. In July 2021, the MTA amended the contract to eliminate the passageway under track 4 in favor of a new ramp between tracks 1 and 4, connecting at its eastern end to two staircases to the Sixth Avenue Line. The amendment was made because the Bank of America Tower&#x27;s owner The Durst Organization did not want to pay for the new underpass, as it had been obliged to do, and because mining the underpass would have disrupted shuttle service.

At Grand Central, the center track, track 3, was removed and the two existing platforms were connected, providing one wide island platform, with an area of . This became the largest platform in the subway system. The existing northern platform was extended further west to accommodate six-car trains, using existing employee facility rooms. New consolidated employee facility rooms were constructed on the existing location of the switch connecting tracks 1 and 3. The P-4 staircase at the western end of the station leading to Madison Avenue from the existing northern platform was demolished and the P-3 staircase leading there from the existing southern platform was considerably widened.

===Post-reconstruction===
In September 2024, the MTA announced that it had finished retrofitting the 42nd Street Shuttle tunnels with 5G cell service. This made the 42nd Street Shuttle the first New York City Subway line to be fully equipped with 5G.

== Track layout ==
Of the four shuttle tracks, only two are in use ; the former express track spaces are used as platform space at each terminal. The former southbound local track is now shuttle track 1. Tracks 2 and 3 no longer exist, but the trackbed of track 2 can be seen inside the tunnel from passing trains on track 1. At the two terminals, the trackway for track 2 was occupied by platforms that formerly provided access to track 3, which was the former northbound express track. There was also a switch between tracks 1 and 3 just west of Grand Central station. The former northbound local track, track 4, was not connected to either track 1 or track 3. Track 2 was removed between the two stations in 1975, and circuit breaker houses have been constructed on the roadbed of track 2. Track 3, the former northbound express track, was taken out of service on November 7, 2020, then removed in 2021. Prior to the 2020 renovation at the Times Square station, in order to provide a connection between the platform for track 4, the former 43rd Street entrance, and the rest of the station complex, there was a pedestrian bridge over track 4. The pedestrian bridge could be temporarily removed to allow the train on track 4 to leave for maintenance on an as-needed basis.

Track 1 is connected to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line&#x27;s southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line&#x27;s northbound local track north of Times Square station. Since 1918, it has been physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks.

== Operation ==
The shuttle operates at all times except between midnight and 5:50 a.m. weekdays, and between midnight and 6:00 a.m. weekends, when alternate service is provided by the parallel . When in service, each of the shuttle trains uses its own track; e.g., the train on track 1 simply runs back and forth on track 1, and there is no switching involved in reversing at each terminal. To provide for quick turnaround of the shuttle trains, there is a motorman at each end of the train. Depending on which direction the train is traveling the operators swap jobs when the train gets to one end; one acts as the operator in the front and the other acts as conductor in the rear. Trains run on weekdays every 2 to 4 minutes during rush hours and every 5 minutes at other times. On weekends, trains run every 5 minutes during daytime hours and every 10 minutes during the early morning and late evening. 10 trains per hour run on each track in each direction. It takes 90 seconds for trains to travel between Times Square and Grand Central, and trains reach a top speed of before they have to decelerate. Prior to the shuttle&#x27;s renovation project, shuttle service was provided by three-car trains on tracks 1 and 4, and a four-car train on track 3.

It is common for shuttle trains to display advertising that entirely covers the interiors and exteriors of the train, as opposed to other routes, whose stock only displays advertising on placards inside the train. Since 2008, the MTA has tested full-train advertisements on 42nd Street Shuttle rolling stock. While most advertisements are well received, a few advertisements have been controversial. Among the more contentious wraps that were withdrawn are a 2015 ad for the TV show &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, which featured a Nazi flag, and an ad for FS1, in which a shuttle train and half of its seats were plastered with negative quotes about the New York Knicks, one of the city&#x27;s NBA teams.

When the shuttle is closed, the area is sometimes used for movie and TV filming. For instance, some scenes from &quot;The French Connection&quot; were filmed on the 42nd Street Shuttle.
