<text>Karel Ančerl (11 April 1908 – 3 July 1973) was a Czechoslovak conductor and composer, renowned especially for his performances of contemporary music and for his interpretations of music by Czech composers.

Ančerl was born into a prosperous Jewish family in the village of Tučapy in southern Bohemia. After graduating from the Prague Conservatory, he pursued his conducting studies under Hermann Scherchen and Václav Talich. He was the assistant conductor at the Munich premiere of Alois Hába&#x27;s quarter-tone opera &quot;Mother&quot; (1931) and conducted the orchestra of the avant-garde theatre &quot;Osvobozené divadlo&quot; in Prague (1931–1933). Conducting work for Czechoslovak radio was interrupted by World War II which resulted in his being imprisoned with his family in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942 and then sent to Auschwitz in 1944. Unlike his wife and young son, Ančerl survived Auschwitz.

After the war, Ančerl conducted for Radio Prague until 1950, when he became artistic director of the Czech Philharmonic, a post he held successfully for eighteen years. Following the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, Ančerl emigrated to Toronto, Canada, where he worked as music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra until his death in 1973.

As a conductor, Ančerl helped foster a distinctly Czech orchestral sound, both within the Czech Philharmonic and elsewhere. Highly regarded also as a studio artist, Ančerl made a wide range of recordings on the Supraphon label, including repertoire by various Czech composers (remastered in the Karel Ančerl Gold Edition).

==Life==
He was born into a prosperous Jewish family in the village of Tučapy in southern Bohemia, where his father Leopold was a large-scale producer of liquors and spirits. After graduating from the gymnasium in Prague (1918–24) he studied composition and conducting at the Prague Conservatory between 1925 and 1929, along with chamber music, violin and percussion. In 1931 he participated as assistant conductor at the Munich premiere of Alois Hába&#x27;s quarter-tone opera &quot;Mother&quot;. Ančerl also studied conducting under Hermann Scherchen in Strasbourg and with Václav Talich in Prague. Between 1931 and 1933, he conducted the orchestra of the avant-garde theatre &quot;Osvobozené divadlo&quot; in Prague, where he brought about a marked improvement in playing standards. From 1933 to 1939, he conducted for the Czechoslovak radio, but his career as a conductor was interrupted by World War II.

He was sent with his family to the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Terezín) on 12 November 1942. There, he became the leader of the large &quot;Terezín String Orchestra&quot; and started to organize cultural and music life in the ghetto. His final performance was for the propaganda film &quot;Theresienstadt&quot;, directed, under coercion of the camp commandant Karl Rahm, by Kurt Gerron to fool the Red Cross. The film showed Ančerl conducting a work by Pavel Haas on a wooden pavilion, with flowerpots hiding the fact that many of the orchestra were barefoot. The film also featured Martin Roman&#x27;s big band, the Ghetto Swingers. As soon as the film was over, Gerron, Ančerl, Haas, Roman and all those who had participated in the film were herded into cattle trucks for the final transport to Auschwitz on 15 October 1944. Ančerl managed to survive Auschwitz, but his wife Valy and son Jan (born in Terezín) were murdered in the gas chambers.

From 1946 to 1947 he was a conductor for The State Opera. Later he conducted for Prague Radio Symphony Orchestra until he was appointed artistic director of the Czech Philharmonic on the recommendation of David Oistrakh in 1950. His eighteen-year tenure with this orchestra is often regarded as its greatest period, which brought it much international recognition. In 1950 he joined masonic lodge &quot;Dílna lidskosti&quot; in Prague, which was part of the National Grand Lodge of Czechoslovakia. In August 1968, after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he decided to emigrate to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He conducted his last two concerts with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra at the Prague Spring Festival in 1969. He conducted the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1968 until his death in Toronto in 1973. His tomb is located in Vyšehrad cemetery in Prague.

Some of his notable pupils include Brian Jackson, Štěpán Koníček, Libor Pešek, Jan Tausinger, and Martin Turnovský.

==Style==
As a conductor, Ančerl followed a recognizably Czech tradition. Along with Václav Talich, Karel Šejna, Václav Neumann and others, he helped foster a distinctly Czech orchestral sound. Rhythmic sharpness, vibrant dynamics, and a keenly etched sound were hallmarks of his conducting style. While these characteristics were especially evident when he conducted his home orchestra, the Czech Philharmonic, he also persuaded orchestras as diverse as the Toronto Symphony, the Vienna Symphony and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra to play with a distinctive Czech sound. Ancerl&#x27;s work on the podium brought out the indigenous characteristics of repertoire to which that would apply, and always displayed a flexibly molded and incredibly minute attention to detail. Also remarkable was an innate classical sense to his work in Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms. There was a grace to Ancerl&#x27;s music-making, and a spiritually-infused lyricism absorbed by a love of life and of nature - sample his discs of Martinu&#x27;s Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, or Mahler&#x27;s Ninth on Supraphon - that was a clear stand-out. He himself may have attributed some of this to the horrors he witnessed or experienced during the war - certainly a few others have.

Ančerl remains highly regarded as a recording artist. His broad range of recordings for the Czech Supraphon label have been carefully remastered for the Karel Ančerl Gold Edition, which was awarded the &quot;Grand Prix du Disque&quot; by &quot;l&#x27;Académie Charles Cros&quot;. In addition to performances of Czech composers, including Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, Leoš Janáček, Bohuslav Martinů and Miloslav Kabeláč, Ančerl is also admired for his interpretations of 20th-century composers such as Gustav Mahler, Igor Stravinsky, Béla Bartók, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich, as well as the Toronto-based organist/composer Healey Willan. He also championed less widely known Czech composers, such as Jan Hanuš, Iša Krejčí, Otmar Mácha and Ladislav Vycpálek. Performances with several orchestras have appeared on labels such as Tahra, CBC Records and EMI. Line Classics has issued some radio recordings made during the late 1940s, when Ančerl returned to Prague.

<doc id="317532" wikidata="Q165671" url="?curid=317532" title="Sergiu Celibidache">
<text>Sergiu Celibidache (; 13 August 1996) was a Romanian conductor, composer, musical theorist, and teacher. Educated in his native Romania, and later in Paris and Berlin, Celibidache&#x27;s career in music spanned over five decades, including tenures as principal conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the  RAI National Symphony Orchestra, the  Orchestre de Radio France, the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and many other European orchestras such as the  Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra or the London Symphony Orchestra.

Considering teaching as one of the most important activities, he taught music and musical phenomelogy at the  Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, Italy as well as at Mainz University in Germany, at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the  Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival in Germany and towards the end at the  Schola Cantorum  in Paris.

Celibidache categorically refused to release his performances on commercial recordings during his lifetime, claiming that a listener could not have a &quot;transcendental experience&quot; outside the concert hall. Many of the recordings of his performances were released posthumously. He has nonetheless earned international acclaim for his interpretations of the classical repertoire and was known for a spirited performance style informed by his study and experiences in Zen Buddhism. He is regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==

Sergiu Celibidache was born on 28 June 1912 to Demostene Celebidachi, a cavalry officer of the Romanian army and later prefect of the Iași region and Maria Celebidachi (née Brăteanu), in Roman, a small city in the Moldavia region of Romania, where his father was a government official. He grew up in Iași, where his family soon moved after his birth. He was already improvising at the piano by the age of four, and after a traditional schooling in mathematics, philosophy and music in Iași, was sent by his father to Bucharest and then to Paris, where he continued his studies. His father had expected him to pursue a political career in Romania, but in 1936 Celibidache enrolled in the Hochschule für Musik (Academy of Music) in Berlin (German authorities erroneously changed his surname from Celebidachi to Celibidache, the form he was known under), where he studied composition with Heinz Tiessen and conducting with Kurt Thomas, Walter Gmeindl and Fritz Stein. He continued with doctoral studies at the Friedrich Wilhelm University (Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität), where he studied philosophy with Nicolai Hartmann and Eduard Spranger and musicology with Arnold Schering and Georg Schünemann. He submitted a dissertation on Josquin des Prez and received his degree in 1944. Throughout the 1940s, he accompanied and was romantically involved with Romanian-born dancer and choreographer Iris Barbura. During his studies in Berlin, Celibidache was introduced to Zen Buddhism by his teacher Martin Steinke, and Buddhism informed Celibidache&#x27;s worldview and work for the rest of his life. In a 1986 interview, he said, &quot;I was born a Christian Orthodox, and studied philosophy, but I still couldn&#x27;t find solutions to my problems. It was through Steinke that I found [...] the way of Zen. All I can say is that without Zen I couldn&#x27;t have known this strange principle that the beginning is in the end, and the end is in the beginning. Music is nothing but the materialization of this principle.&quot;

==Career==

 Wilhelm Furtwängler being banned for having conducted under Hitler, Celibidache was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic from 1945 to 1952. He got his big break shortly after the end of World War II in tragic circumstances: Leo Borchard, who was cleared to conduct by the American forces, was shot during a nocturnal car ride. 
Celibidache just won the contest organised by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra. In search of a replacement, the Berlin Philharmonic took Celibidache away from the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra to become the youngest General Musik Director of the Berlin Philharmonic
. Following  Furtwängler denazification in 1947, Furtwängler was able to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic in alternance with Celibidache. 

When in 1954 Furtwängler died, Celibidache who was already creating waves with the management regarding the age of some of the musicians as well as the limitations and dangers of recordings, was overlooked to be Furtwängler’s official successor. Instead, the Berlin Philharmonic chose Herbert von Karajan. It took 37 years before a collaboration could once again take place: the concert of Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7 happened only at the instigation of the German president at the time, Richard von Weizsäcker.

Celibidache later worked with radio orchestras in Stockholm, Stuttgart and Paris. He also worked in Britain in the late 1940s and 1950s, due partly to the promotional efforts of the pianist Eileen Joyce and her partner, an artists&#x27; agent. Joyce said that Celibidache was the greatest conductor she had ever worked with: &quot;he was the only one who got inside my soul&quot;. In 1970 he was awarded Denmark&#x27;s Sonning Award. From 1979 until his death he was music director of the Munich Philharmonic. He regularly taught at Hochschule für Musik Mainz in Germany and in 1984 taught at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Teaching was a major focus throughout his life and his courses were frequently open to all without any fee. Among his notable students are Enrique García Asensio, Konrad von Abel, Françoys Bernier, Raffaele Napoli, Rony Rogoff, Bernhard Sieberer, Markand Thakar, and Nils-Göran Areskoug.

He appeared in the film &quot;Ambassadors of Music&quot; (1952), conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Egmont overture.
Later, he was the subject of two major documentaries: &quot;Celibidache, let it evolve&quot; by Jan Schmidt-Garre and &quot;Celibidache&#x27;s Garden&quot; by his son Serge Ioan Celebidachi.

==Later years==

A controversy arose over discriminatory behaviour that came to light during a 12-year legal battle during his tenure at the Munich Philharmonic with trombonist Abbie Conant. Celibidache claimed Conant lacked the &quot;necessary strength&quot; and &quot;emotional empathy&quot; to lead the trombone section. She was asked to sit in the second chair. Celibidache was not invited to give testimony at the trials. Finally, the courts found in favour of Conant. As a consequence, Conant was paid the same as her male colleagues.

After 37 years of absence, Celibidache was asked by Federal President Richard von Weizsacker to return to Berlin and conduct the Berlin Philharmonic one more time in order to symbolise the end of communism in Europe and the German Reunification. Celibidache conducted Bruckner 7th on the 31st of March 1992 with the Berlin Philharmonic.

Celibidache died at the age of 84 on 14 August 1996 at Nemours, near Paris. He was buried in the Cimetière de Neuville sur Essonne.

==Performance style==

Celibidache&#x27;s approach to music-making is often described more by what he did not do instead of what he did. For example, much has been made of Celibidache&#x27;s &quot;refusal&quot; to make recordings even though almost all of his concert activity actually was recorded - having accepted live radio broadcasts - with many released posthumously by major labels such as EMI and Deutsche Grammophon with the consent of his family. In his view, music is made of the cumulation of thousands of &quot;Nos&quot; and one final &quot;yes&quot; when the conditions are eventually all gathered during a concert. It was all about the live experience, the ability to be &quot;in the now&quot;. 

Celibidache&#x27;s focus was indeed on creating, during each concert, the optimal conditions for what he called a &quot;transcendent experience&quot;. Aspects of Zen Buddhism, such as &quot;ichi-go ichi-e&quot;, strongly influenced his music making. He believed that transcendental experiences were extremely unlikely to ensue when listening to recorded music, so he eschewed them. As a result, some of his concerts did provide audiences with exceptional and sometimes life-altering experiences, including, for example, a 1984 concert in Carnegie Hall by the Orchestra of the Curtis Institute that New York Times critic John Rockwell described as the best of his 25 years of concert-going.

Celibidache was well known for his demands for extensive rehearsal time with orchestras. An oft-mentioned feature of many of his later concerts, captured in the live recordings of them, is a slower tempo than what is considered the norm, while in fast passages (especially in his earlier performances) his tempi often exceeded metronome markings by far. In Celibidache&#x27;s own view, however, criticism of a recording&#x27;s tempo is irrelevant, as it is not (and cannot be) a critique of the performance but rather of a transcription of it, without the ambience of the moment, for him, a key factor in any musical performance. As Celibidache explained, the acoustic space in which one hears a concert directly affects the likelihood of the emergence of his sought-after transcendent experience. The acoustic space within which one hears a recording of one of his performances, on the other hand, has no impact on the performance, as it is impossible for the acoustic features of that space to stimulate musicians to play slower or faster.

That his recorded performances differ so widely from the majority of other recordings has led them to be seen by some as collectors&#x27; items rather than mainstream releases and &#x27;one-offs&#x27; rather than reference recordings.

==Personal life==
In 1965, Celibidache married Ioana Procopie Dumitrescu (1924-2012). They had one son, Sergiu Ioan Celibidache (&quot;Serge&quot;), born 19 June 1968.

<text>Robert Lawson Craft (October 20, 1923 – November 10, 2015) was an American conductor and writer. He is best known for his intimate professional relationship with Igor Stravinsky, on which Craft drew in producing numerous recordings and books.

==Life==
Craft was born in Kingston, New York, to Raymond and Arpha Craft, and studied music at the Juilliard School. He became particularly interested in early music, such as that of Claudio Monteverdi, Carlo Gesualdo, and Heinrich Schütz, and in contemporary music by the composers of the Second Viennese School and others.

Craft met Stravinsky in 1948, and from then until the composer&#x27;s death in 1971, Craft worked with Stravinsky in a variety of roles, eventually evolving into a full artistic partnership. Craft compiled the libretti for Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Flood&quot; and &quot;A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer&quot;, and lived with Igor and Vera Stravinsky in Hollywood and later in New York City. He remained close to the composer&#x27;s widow until her death in 1982.

After Stravinsky&#x27;s death, Craft continued to concertize and to write. His 2002 autobiography &quot;An Improbable Life&quot; details his life before, during, and after his friendship with Stravinsky. The memoir elaborates on the impact Stravinsky had on his life.

Shortly after Stravinsky&#x27;s death, Craft married the composer&#x27;s longtime nurse, Rita Christiansen, but the marriage did not endure. His survivors include a son from that marriage, Alexander; a sister, Phyllis Crawford; his second wife, the former Alva Celauro Minoff, a singer and actress; two stepchildren, Edward Minoff and Melissa Minoff; and four grandchildren. 

Craft died on November 10, 2015, at age 92, at his home in Gulf Stream, Florida.

==Writing==
Craft collaborated with Stravinsky on a series of books that covered various musical and non-musical subjects: &quot;Conversations with Igor Stravinsky&quot; (1959); &quot;Memories and Commentaries&quot; (1960); &quot;Expositions and Developments&quot; (1962); &quot;Dialogues and a Diary&quot; (1963); &quot;Themes and Episodes &quot;(1967); and &quot;Retrospectives and Conclusions&quot; (1969). They include transcribed conversations between the two men and interviews culled from various published sources, essays, diary entries, and the like, all with the professed aim of presenting Stravinsky&#x27;s views on music and culture.

==Conducting==
Craft conducted most of the major U.S. orchestras (New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony, and Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra), as well as in Canada, Europe, Russia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. He was the first American to conduct Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot; and Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Cardillac&quot;. Craft also led the world premieres of Stravinsky&#x27;s later, dodecaphonic works: &quot;Agon&quot;, &quot;The Flood&quot;, &quot;Abraham and Isaac&quot;, &quot;Variations&quot;, &quot;Introitus&quot;, &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot;, and his Bach orchestration &quot;Vom Himmel Hoch&quot;.

Craft was a two-time recipient of the Grand Prix du Disque, as well as the Edison Prize for his recordings of music by Varèse and Stravinsky. His recordings of the music of Stravinsky with the Orchestra of St. Luke&#x27;s were originally available on 11 now out-of-print releases from MusicMasters and seven volumes from Koch. In the mid 1950s he recorded the complete works of Anton Webern. Since 2005, Naxos Records has gradually rereleased these recordings.

== Legacy ==
Craft remained in a vanguard position in relation to 20th-century art music throughout his life. Besides working closely with Stravinsky, he produced volumes of academic and personal writings on Stravinsky and other musicians and composers.

In 2002, Craft was awarded the International Prix du Disque at the Cannes Music Festival.

<text>Antal Doráti (, , ; 9 April 1906 – 13 November 1988) was a Hungarian-born conductor and composer who became a naturalized American citizen in 1943.

==Biography==
Antal Doráti was born in Budapest to a Jewish family. His father Alexander Doráti was a violinist with the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra and his mother Margit Kunwald was a piano teacher.

He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy with Zoltán Kodály and Leó Weiner for composition and Béla Bartók for piano. His links with Bartók continued for many years: he conducted the world premiere of Bartók&#x27;s Viola Concerto, as completed by Tibor Serly, with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1949, with William Primrose as the soloist.

He made his conducting debut in 1924 with the Budapest Royal Opera.

As well as composing original works, he compiled and arranged pieces by Johann Strauss II for the ballet &quot;Graduation Ball&quot; (1940), premiered by the Original Ballet Russe in Sydney, Australia, with himself on the conductor&#x27;s podium. For Ballet Theatre (later renamed American Ballet Theatre) he created scores for the ballets &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1941) from music by Jacques Offenbach and &quot;The Fair at Sorochinsk&quot; (1943) from music by Modest Mussorgsky.

His autobiography, &quot;Notes of Seven Decades&quot;, was published in 1979.

In 1983, Doráti was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).

His wife was Ilse von Alpenheim, an Austrian pianist. Doráti died at the age of 82 in Gerzensee, Switzerland.

==Career==
Doráti held posts as principal conductor of the following orchestras:
* Ballet Russe, Music Director (1937–1941).
* Ballet Theatre orchestra (1941–1945).
* Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1945–1948)
* Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (1949–1960)
* BBC Symphony Orchestra (1963–1966), which bid him a fond farewell playing his &quot;Symphony in Five Movements&quot; and his &quot;Madrigal Suite&quot;.
* Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra (1966–74), with which he recorded his &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot; and his &quot;Symphony No. 2, &quot;Querela Pacis&quot;&quot; on the BIS label. He took that orchestra on its first international tours.
* National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. (1970–1977), which he rescued from bankruptcy and a players&#x27; strike.
* Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (1975–1979)
* Detroit Symphony Orchestra (1977–1981)

==Recordings==
He made his first recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra for the recording label His Master&#x27;s Voice. This was later transferred to RCA Records with whom HMV were for some time associated. Over the course of his career Doráti made over 600 recordings.

With the Philharmonia Hungarica, Doráti was the second conductor to record the complete symphonies of Joseph Haydn (the first complete recorded edition was conducted by Ernst Märzendorfer and the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, but it had a very limited release). He also recorded an unprecedented cycle of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s operas and Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot;, Suites 1, 2 and 3.

Doráti became especially well known for his recordings of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music. He was the first conductor to record all three of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballets – &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; – complete. The albums were recorded in mono in 1954 and 1955, for Mercury Records released on CD by The Doráti Society, with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (later renamed the Minnesota Orchestra), as part of their famous &quot;Living Presence&quot; series. All three ballets were at first issued separately, but were later re-issued in a 6-LP set. Dorati did re-record &quot;Swan Lake&quot; [released on CD by Universal Mercury], but he made a stereo recording of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (complete) with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam for Philips Classics Records, and two complete recordings in stereo of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, one with the London Symphony Orchestra (again for Mercury), and the other with the Concertgebouw Orchestra for Philips – all this within a span of about twenty-seven years. He also recorded all four of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s orchestral suites with the New Philharmonia Orchestra, and he was the first conductor to make a recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812&quot; Overture (featuring the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra) with real cannons, brass band, and church bells, first in mono in 1954 and then in stereo in 1958. Both the mono and stereo &quot;1812&quot; versions sold over one million copies, and were awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He also recorded all six of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphonies with the London Symphony Orchestra.

Other prominent composers in Doráti&#x27;s recording career were Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky. His comprehensive series of Bartók&#x27;s orchestral works for Mercury have been brought together on a 5-CD set.

He also made the first stereo recording of Léo Delibes&#x27; &quot;Coppélia&quot;, with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. An album set of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; is also among Doráti&#x27;s popular recordings.

In 1969, he made the world premiere recording of Sibelius&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Luonnotar&quot;, with Gwyneth Jones as soprano soloist. In 1973 he conducted the world premiere recording of Max Bruch&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, which was written in 1912 but only rediscovered in 1971.

In 1969, with the Stockholm Philharmonic Dorati conducted the first recording of the Symphony No. 7 of Swedish composer [[Allan Pettersson], of which he was the dedicatee.

He made [[digital recording]]s, for English [[Decca Records]] (released in the U.S. on the London label), with the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] for Philips. One of these, the recording of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;[[The Rite of Spring]]&quot; with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, received the coveted French award [[Grand Prix du Disque]].

<text>William Lincoln Christie (born December 19, 1944) is an American-born French conductor and harpsichordist. He is a specialist in baroque and classical repertoire and is the founder of the ensemble Les Arts Florissants.

== Biography ==

Christie studied art history at Harvard University, where he was briefly assistant conductor of the Harvard Glee Club. From 1966, he began studies at Yale University in music, where he was a student of harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick. He was opposed to the Vietnam War, and served in a reserve officers course to avoid the draft. He subsequently taught at Dartmouth College. When his Dartmouth post was not renewed, Christie moved first to the United Kingdom (1970), and in 1971 to France. He was one of a number of young men who left the United States at this time because of disagreement with the Vietnam War, and in order to avoid the draft. In France, he became known for his interpretations of Baroque music, particularly French Baroque music, working with René Jacobs and others. He also performed contemporary music alongside baroque music with the Ensemble Five Centuries.

Christie took French citizenship in 1995. He was appointed Grand Croix de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 2014 and he is an Officier in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He was elected a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts on November 12, 2008, in the &quot;Unattached members&quot; section (&quot;Membres libres&quot;), at the seat formerly held by Marcel Marceau, Seat #1. The elaborate gardens Christie designed for his house in Thiré were designated as a monument historique in 2006. He has also received the Georges Pompidou Prize (2005) as well as the Liliane Bettencourt Choral Singing Prize, which was awarded by the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 2004. In 2002 he was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal.

== Les Arts Florissants ==

In 1979, Christie founded Les Arts Florissants, named after the opera of the same name by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, which was to be its first fully staged production. Major recognition came in 1987 with the production of Lully&#x27;s &quot;Atys&quot; at the Opéra-Comique in Paris. Christie has also presented and recorded many unknown works by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (most of them were world premieres), &quot;Médée&quot; H.491, &quot;David and Jonathas&quot; H.490, &quot;Le Malade imaginaire&quot; H.495, &quot;La Descente d&#x27;Orphée aux enfers&quot; H.488, &quot;Les Plaisirs de Versailles&quot; H.480, &quot;Actéon&quot; H.481, many works composed for Christmas time, but also André Campra, Henry Desmarest, Michel-Richard Delalande, François Couperin, Jean-Joseph de Mondonville, Claudio Monteverdi and Jean-Philippe Rameau.

== Teaching ==

Christie was a professor at the Paris Conservatoire from 1982 to 1995, and maintains an active role in pedagogy by participating in master classes and academies. In 2002, he founded &quot;Le Jardin des Voix&quot;, a biennial academy for young singers in Caen. Since 2007, he has had an affiliation with the Juilliard School, providing master classes in historical performance practice.

== Repertoire ==
Christie has widened his group&#x27;s core French repertoire, performing Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Henry Purcell, George Frideric Handel, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He has been guest conductor at the Glyndebourne Festival, and productions for Zurich Opera, Festival d&#x27;Aix and the Opéra de Lyon. He has also conducted period-instrument performances with more modern ensembles such as the Berlin Philharmonic.
In 2016 he conducted Les Arts Florissants in Bach&#x27;s B Minor Mass at the Royal Albert Hall Proms.

<text>Charles Édouard Dutoit is a Swiss conductor. He is the principal guest conductor for the Saint Petersburg Philharmonia.

In 2017, he became the 103rd recipient of the Royal Philharmonic Society Gold Medal Award. Dutoit held previous positions with the London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, the Tokyo NHK Symphony and the Orchestre National de France. As of 2017, he was conductor emeritus of the Verbier Music Festival Orchestra. He is an honorary member of the Ravel Foundation in France and the Stravinsky Foundation in Switzerland.

In December 2017, following allegations of sexual assault, the Boston and San Francisco Symphonies cancelled his engagements. In a statement, Dutoit denied the charges.

==Biography==
Dutoit was born on the 10th of July 1936 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He studied there, and graduated from the Conservatoire de musique de Genève, where he won first prize in conducting. Then he went to the Accademia Chigiana in Siena at the invitation of Alceo Galliera. In his younger days, he frequently attended Ernest Ansermet&#x27;s rehearsals and had a personal acquaintance with him. He also worked with Herbert von Karajan at Lucerne as a member of the festival youth orchestra and studied at Tanglewood.

Dutoit began his professional music career in 1957 as a viola player with various orchestras across Europe and South America. In January 1959, he made his debut as a professional conductor with an orchestra of Radio Lausanne and Martha Argerich. From 1959 he was a guest conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra. After this, he was the conductor for Radio Zurich until 1967, when he took over the Bern Symphony Orchestra from Paul Kletzki, where he stayed for 11 years.

While head of the Bern Symphony, he also conducted the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico from 1973 to 1975, and Sweden&#x27;s Gothenburg Symphony from 1975 to 1978. Dutoit was principal guest conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra in the early 1980s.

In 1977, Dutoit became the artistic director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (OSM). In the words of Glasgow-based music critic Kate Molleson: &quot;A 20-year recording contract with Decca made the MSO the most recorded orchestra in the world, and the best of these recordings — Ravel&#x27;s &quot;La Valse&quot; and &quot;Daphnis et Chloe&quot;, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot;, Stravinsky&#x27;s French-period ballets — remain unsurpassed.&quot; Reaction to Dutoit joining the Montreal Symphony was positive. Peter G. Davis stated that Dutoit transformed the Montreal Symphony. New York Magazine wrote similarly about Dutoit, adding that he was noted for the championing of new Canadian music. Throughout these years, he called without success for a new symphony concert hall for Montréal. Dutoit resigned from the Montreal Symphony in April 2002, with immediate effect, after the Quebec Musicians Guild complained about what it called Dutoit&#x27;s &quot;offensive behaviour and complete lack of respect for the musicians&quot;. In January 2018, the OSM acknowledged ignoring complaints from musicians of verbal and &#x27;psychological harassment&#x27; by Dutoit dating back to the 1990s. He did not return to the OSM as a guest conductor until 2016, in a concert at the new &quot;Maison Symphonique de Montréal&quot;.

Dutoit has received more than 40 international awards and distinctions, including two Grammy Awards (United States), several Juno Awards (Canada), the Grand Prix du Président de la République (France), the Prix mondial du disque de Montreux (Switzerland), the Amsterdam Edison Award, the Japan Record Academy Award, and the German Music Critics&#x27; Award. He and the OSM made many recordings for the Decca/London label.

Dutoit first conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1980. From 1990 to 1999, he was music director of the orchestra&#x27;s summer concerts at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts. From 1990 to 2010, he was artistic director and principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s summer festival in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1991, he was made an Honorary Citizen of the city of Philadelphia. In February 2007, Dutoit was named the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor and artistic adviser, for a contract of four years, effective September 2008. Following the conclusion of his contract in Philadelphia in 2012, the orchestra named him its conductor laureate, as of the 2012–13 season.

Since 1990, Dutoit has directed the Pacific Music Festival in Japan. From 1991 to 2001, Dutoit was music director of the Orchestre National de France, with whom he made a number of recordings and toured extensively. In 1996, he was appointed principal conductor and in 1998 music director of Tokyo&#x27;s NHK Symphony Orchestra. For the NHK television network, he made a series of documentary films for the young people called &quot;Cities of Music&quot; in Venice, St Petersburg, Tokyo, Buenos Aires (plus Rio de Janeiro and Manhaus), New York, Vienna, Budapest, Leipzig, Dresden, Paris and London. In 1997, he was made an honorary Officer of the Order of Canada. He is also one of a handful of non-Canadian citizens to be a Grand Officer of the Ordre national du Québec.

In April 2007, Dutoit was named principal conductor and artistic director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as of 2009. In October 2019 he was scheduled to stand down as the RPO&#x27;s principal conductor and to take the title of Honorary Conductor for Life of the orchestra, but instead he resigned in January 2018.

Between 2009 and 2017, Dutoit also served as the music director of the Verbier Festival Orchestra in Switzerland. In April 2014, Dutoit received the Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Classical Music Awards. He was also made an honorary member of Fondation Igor Stravinsky in Geneva and Fondation Ravel in Monfort l&#x27;Amaury, France.

In September 2018, Dutoit was named principal guest conductor of the St Petersburg Philharmonic, effective May 2019.

In late 2021, Dutoit withdrew from a scheduled subscription concert of the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra due to his infection with COVID-19. He was subsequently booked by the Orchestra to conduct in Summer, 2023.

==Personal life==
Dutoit shuns publicity and protects his private life from the media. He has been married four times. His first marriage was to Ruth Cury, by whom he has a son, Ivan, who lives in Santa Monica, California, with his family; his children are Anne-Sophie and Jean-Sebastian. Dutoit was also married to Argentine concert pianist Martha Argerich (with whom he has a daughter, Anne-Catherine) and to Canadian economist Marie-Josée Drouin. He is now married to Canadian violinist Chantal Juillet.

==Allegations of sexual assault==
In 2017 four women accused Dutoit of sexually assaulting them between the late 1970s and 2010. The alleged incidents occurred in a variety of places.
One allegation was contested by witnesses. The allegations were made by Paula Rasmussen, mezzo-soprano (1991, Los Angeles); Sylvia McNair, soprano (1985, Minnesota); and Jenny Q. Chai, pianist. A singer with the Philadelphia Orchestra also claimed that Dutoit assaulted her in 2006 in upstate New York and again in 2010 in Philadelphia. A 24-year-old musician with the Civic Orchestra of Chicago alleged that Dutoit forced himself on her in 2006. In January 2018, Fiona Allan, a British theatre administrator, said that when she was an intern Dutoit sexually assaulted her at Tanglewood 20 years earlier.

In March 2018, the Boston Symphony said that Allan&#x27;s allegations were &quot;credible&quot; and that three other women &quot;credibly described incidents in the 1980s and 1990s in which they, too, were victims of Dutoit&#x27;s sexual misconduct.&quot;

Other women also claimed assault.

===Reaction===
In January 2018 Dutoit resigned from his position as artistic director and principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Several other orchestras either cancelled engagements or severed ties with him, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra (which also removed his title of conductor laureate), the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

The same month, Canadian CBC Radio/CBC Radio Two adopted a policy of no longer crediting Dutoit as conductor when it played his recordings.

<text>Carlo Maria Giulini (; 9 May 1914 – 14 June 2005) was an Italian conductor.
From the age of five, when he began to play the violin, Giulini&#x27;s musical education was expanded when he began to study at Italy&#x27;s foremost conservatory, the Conservatorio Santa Cecilia in Rome at the age of 16. Initially, he studied the viola and conducting; then, following an audition, he won a place in the Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia.

Although he won a conducting competition two years later, he was unable to take advantage of the prize, which was the opportunity to conduct, because of being forced to join the army during World War II despite being a pacifist. As the war was ending, he hid until the liberation to avoid continuing to fight alongside the Germans. While in hiding, he married his girlfriend, Marcella, and they remained together until her death in 1995. Together, they had three children.
After the 1944 liberation, he was invited to lead what was then known as the Augusteo Orchestra (now 
the Santa Cecilia Orchestra) in its first post-Fascist concert, and quickly other conducting opportunities came along. These included some of the world&#x27;s major orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, London&#x27;s Philharmonia Orchestra and the Vienna Philharmonic. His career spanned 54 years with retirement coming in 1998. He died in Brescia, Italy, at 91 years of age.

==Early life==
Giulini was born in Barletta, Kingdom of Italy, to a father from Lombardy and a mother from Naples; but he was raised in Bolzano, which at the time of his birth was part of Austria (it became Italian, following a provision included in the Treaty of London (1915), with the end of First World War in 1919). Therefore, most of the neighbors spoke a dialect of German, and the local music he heard tended to be Austrian/Tyrolean. He recalled being transfixed by the town band.

For Christmas in 1919, when he was five, Giulini was given a violin and he progressed rapidly with local instructors, notably a Bohemian violinist (and local pharmacist) whom he called &quot;Brahms.&quot; In 1928, the distinguished Italian violinist/composer Remy Principe (1889–1977) gave a recital in Bolzano, and auditioned Giulini; he invited Giulini to study with him at Italy&#x27;s foremost conservatory, the Conservatorio Santa Cecilia in Rome. Giulini undertook his studies there two years later, at the age of 16. He studied viola with Principe, composition with Alessandro Bustini (1876–1970), and conducting with Bernardino Molinari.

At the age of 18, in order to supplement his family&#x27;s income (which had been depleted by the Great Depression), he auditioned for the viola section of the Orchestra dell&#x27;Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, at the time Italy&#x27;s foremost orchestra. He recalled crying for joy when informed that he had won the audition and would be the orchestra&#x27;s last-desk violist.

Among the guest conductors he played under were Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Richard Strauss, Victor de Sabata, Fritz Reiner, Pierre Monteux, Igor Stravinsky, and Otto Klemperer. His first public performance was the First Symphony of Brahms under Walter. Giulini told interviewers that he loved the gentle manner of Bruno Walter, who he said had a gift for making every musician feel important.

==Career==

In 1940, Giulini won a conducting competition, whose prize was the chance to conduct the St. Cecilia orchestra, but before the concert, Giulini was drafted into the Italian army, made a second lieutenant, and sent to the front in Croatia. However, because of his commitment to pacifism and intense opposition to fascism and to Benito Mussolini, he did not fire his gun at human targets.

In 1942, on a 30-day break in Rome, he married Marcella de Girolami (1921–1995), his girlfriend since 1938; they remained together until her death 53 years later. In September 1943, the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces was signed, but the Nazi occupation refused to abandon Rome, and Giulini&#x27;s Italian commander ordered his troops to fight with the Nazis. Giulini chose instead to go into hiding, living for nine months in a tunnel underneath a home owned by his wife&#x27;s uncle, along with two friends and a Jewish family which was avoiding Nazi arrest and deportation. Posters around Rome with his face and name instructed that he be shot on sight.

After the Allies liberated Rome on 4 June 1944, Giulini—who was among the few conductors not tainted by associations with Fascism—was chosen to lead the Accademia&#x27;s first post-Fascist concert, held on 16 July 1944. On the program was the Brahms Symphony No. 4, which he had studied while in hiding. It became the work he conducted most frequently over the course of his career, with a total of 180 performances.

Giulini began working with the Chamber Orchestra of Rome in 1944, and was made its music director in 1946. Also in 1944 he became assistant conductor of the RAI (Italian Radio) Orchestra in Rome, becoming its principal conductor in 1946. Four years later he was involved in the founding of the Milan Radio Orchestra, working with them from 1946 to 1954, as well as with the RAI&#x27;s Rome orchestra.

===Giulini and conducting opera===
Although Giulini conducted &quot;La traviata&quot; for Italian radio in 1948, he conducted his first staged opera in 1950 in Bergamo. It was &quot;La traviata&quot; and he returned the following year, this time with Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi alternating in the role of Violetta. Also, he revived several obscure operas, including works by Alessandro Scarlatti. His work in Bergamo came to the attention of Arturo Toscanini, who asked to meet the young conductor, and the two men formed a deep bond. Toscanini recommended Giulini for the musical directorship at La Scala; Giulini had also won the attention and support of Victor de Sabata, the principal conductor of La Scala, who engaged him as his assistant. Giulini conducted his first opera at La Scala, Falla&#x27;s &quot;La vida breve&quot;, in February 1952 and succeeded De Sabata as its music director in 1953 after a heart attack caused the older man to leave the position.

In his five years in the position, Giulini conducted 13 productions, which included:

Though highly admired, he resigned after members of the audience jeered Maria Callas during a run of operas from 16 February to 27 April 1956.

His UK debut took place at the 1955 Edinburgh Festival conducting Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; for the Glyndebourne Opera company when it toured to that city.

In 1958, Giulini conducted a highly acclaimed production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (directed by Visconti), where it was also noted that &quot;what emerged under Giulini&#x27;s baton was a consistent, convincing masterpiece of astonishing power and lyrical tension.&quot; Although he returned to Covent Garden in 1957, it became clear that, after two more Covent Garden performances in 1961 and 1964 (the famous black-and-white &quot;Il trovatore&quot;) and another at the Holland Festival in 1965, where he disagreed so strongly with the visual treatment of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; on the stage that he refused to conduct, and only concert performances were given, Giulini would abandon opera, not wanting to compromise his artistic vision. Almost without exception from then on, he concentrated on orchestral works.

As illustrated, his relationships with opera managements were not always of the best: &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;he rebelled against the decor and production of a &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival, conducting it with a minimum of scenery; and in 1968, after a production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in Rome, he became so disenchanted with the management of opera that he was not seen in an opera house for 14 years.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; summed up Giulini&#x27;s approach to working in the area of operas as follows:
===Giulini as orchestra conductor===

Giulini expanded his repertoire at a careful pace, not conducting the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven until the 1960s. During the 1960s, he was in great demand as a guest conductor of leading orchestras around the world, and made numerous well-received recordings with the Philharmonia Orchestra of London and several others.

In 1955 he had made his American debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, leading to a 23-year association with the orchestra; he was its Principal Guest Conductor from 1969 to 1972, although he continued to appear with them regularly until 18 March 1978. In 1956, he began his association with the Philharmonia of London and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

In addition to his role in Chicago, he was music director of the Vienna Symphony from 1973 to 1976. From 1978 to 1984, he served as principal conductor and music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, launching his tenure there with performances of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony. In 1982 he returned once more to opera, conducting a widely acclaimed production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Overall, his impact on the musical world of the mid-to-late 20th century is summed up by Anthony Tommasini in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary of 2005:

Far from being an autocratic conductor or a kinetic dynamo of the podium, Mr. Giulini was a probing musician who achieved results by projecting serene authority and providing a model of selfless devotion to the score. His symphonic performances were at once magisterial and urgent, full of surprise yet utterly natural. He brought breadth and telling detail to the operas of Mozart and Verdi.

===Notable recordings===
Giulini&#x27;s most notable opera recordings include the 1959 Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus versions of Mozart&#x27;s operas &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; for EMI, as well as his live 1955 recording of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; with Maria Callas. He also made recordings of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; and the &quot;Four Sacred Pieces&quot;, which were highly praised.

Admired orchestral records include Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot; and &quot;Nocturnes&quot;, Dvořák&#x27;s 9th Symphony and Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 6th Symphony with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, Brahms&#x27;s 4th Symphony and Mahler&#x27;s 1st and 9th symphonies with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Beethoven&#x27;s 3rd and 5th Symphonies, and Schumann&#x27;s 3rd Symphony with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Brahms&#x27;s four Symphonies and German requiem, and Anton Bruckner&#x27;s 7th, 8th and 9th symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic, Dvořák&#x27;s 7th and 9th Symphonies with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, and Schubert&#x27;s 8th and 9th Symphonies with the Bavarian Radio Symphony. Most of these discs were recorded for the Deutsche Grammophon label. His live recording of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; made in the Royal Albert Hall in 1969 which is available as a BBC Legends recording was a Gramophone Award winner.

<text>Ascoli Piceno (; ; ) is a (municipality) and capital of the province of Ascoli Piceno, in the Italian region of Marche.

==Geography==
The town lies at the confluence of the River Tronto and the small River Castellano and is surrounded on three sides by mountains. Two natural parks border the town, one on the northwestern flank (Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini) and the other on the southern (Parco Nazionale dei Monti della Laga).
Ascoli has good rail connections to the Adriatic coast and the city of San Benedetto del Tronto, by highway to Porto d&#x27;Ascoli and by the Italian National Road 4 Salaria to Rome.

==History==
&quot;Ausculum&quot; of ancient Picenum was founded by the Italic (Piceni) and was originally a Sabine city.

Following its defeat by the Romans in 268 BC, Asculum became a &quot;civitas foederata&quot;, a &quot;federated&quot; city with nominal independence from Rome. It was later connected by the important Via Salaria, the salt road that connected Latium with the salt production areas on the Adriatic coast.

It was the first Italian city to rise up against Rome in 90 BC during the Social War. An account described the city as home to a war-like people that bore generation-old grudge against Rome for encroaching on its northern territories. It was besieged and captured following the Battle of Asculum (89 BC). Discovered artifacts in the city such as sling bullets show that the siege included at least four Roman legions as well as Gallic and Spanish auxiliaries. Following the war, it became a &quot;municipium&quot;. In the triumviral period or under Augustus, it became a &quot;colonia&quot;.

During the Middle Ages Ascoli was ravaged by the Ostrogoths and then by the Lombards of King Faroald (578). After nearly two centuries as part of the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto (593–789), Ascoli was ruled by the Franks through their vicars, but ultimately it was the bishops that gained influence and power over the city.

In 1189 a free republican municipality was established but internal strife led dramatically to the demise of civic values and freedom and to unfortunate ventures against neighboring enemies. This unstable situation opened the way to foreign dictatorships, like those of Galeotto I Malatesta (14th century), initially recruited as a mercenary (condottiero) in the war against Fermo, and Francesco Sforza. Sforza was ousted in 1482, but Ascoli was again compelled to submit to the Papal suzerainty. In 1860 it was annexed, together with Marche and Umbria, into the newly unified Kingdom of Italy.

==Main sights==

Many of the buildings in the historical part of the city are built using local travertine. Near the Renaissance square Piazza del Popolo, the Piazza Arringo was the administrative and religious centre of the town, surrounded by the Cathedral, the baptistery, the Bishop&#x27;s residence, and the Palace of the Commune. 

According to traditional accounts, Ascoli Piceno housed some two hundred towers in the Middle Ages: today some fifty can still be seen.

===Churches and convents===
*Cathedral of Sant&#x27;Emidio, dedicated to Saint Emygdius, houses an altarpiece by Carlo Crivelli.
*Tempietto di Sant&#x27;Emidio alle Grotte
*Tempietto di Sant&#x27;Emidio Rosso
*San Francesco: Gothic style church begun in 1258. The dome was completed in 1549. A monument to Pope Julius II is in the side portal, while the central portal is one of the finest examples of local travertine decoration. Adjacent to the church is the 16th century &quot;Loggia dei Mercanti&quot;, in Bramantesque style of the Roman High Renaissance.
*Convent of San Francesco: adjacent to the above-named church, of which two noteworthy cloisters remain today. It was once a prestigious center of culture, whose students included Pope Sixtus V.
*Sant&#x27;Agostino: 14th century church built originally with a single nave, was enlarged with two aisles in the late 15th century. The rectangular façade has a 1547 portal similar to that of Sant&#x27;Emidio. The convent houses the town library, the Contemporary Art Gallery and an auditorium.
*San Cristoforo: Catholic Baroque church located in the historic center of the city
*San Domenico: former convent, now school. It has a Renaissance cloister with 17th century frescoes.
*Santa Maria Inter Vineas: 13th century church
*San Pietro Martire: 13th century church with a 1523 side portal by Nicola Filotesio, known locally as Cola d&#x27;Amatrice. The interior contains the precious reliquary of the Holy Thorn, a gift of Philip IV of France.
*San Tommaso: 1069 Romanesque-style church built with &quot;spolia&quot; from the neighboring Roman amphitheater
*San Vittore: Romanesque church documented from 996 with a low bell tower
*Edicola di Morelli: monumental Baroque niche attached to the exterior of the church of San Francesco at the Piazza del Popolo. The niche housed a venerated Madonna image, putatively designed by Lazzaro Morelli, a disciple of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

===Secular buildings===

*The Roman Ponte del Gran Caso
*Roman Solestà Bridge
*Ponte di Cecco: Roman bridge over the Castellano
*The Roman walls of the &quot;Fortezza Pia&quot; in the upper part of the town
* &quot;Vesta&#x27;s&quot; temple: devoted to the cult of Isis
* Roman temple rebuilt as an auditorium
*The Palazzo dei Capitani del Popolo (&#x27;Palace of the People&#x27;s Captains&#x27;). Built in the 13th century connecting three pre-existing edifices, it was the seat of the &quot;podestà&quot;, the people&#x27;s captains and, later, of the Papal governors. In the 15th century the southern side was enlarged and, in 1520, a Mannerist façade was added in the rear side. In 1535 it underwent a general renovation, and in 1549 a new portal, with a monument of Pope Paul III, was added.
*Palazzo dell&#x27;Arengo: located near the Cathedral
*Palazzo Malaspina: palace in Corso Mezzini, previous 14th century structure reconstructed in the 16th century using designs attributed to architect Nicola Filotesio
*Porta Gemina (&#x27;Twin Gate&#x27;): an ancient Roman gate from the 1st century BC, through which the Via Salaria entered the city. The ruins of the ancient theater are located nearby. It had two passageways, each tall and wide.
*Porta Tufilla: a tower-like gate built in 1552–55. It is annexed to the Ponte Tufillo, a medieval bridge built in 1097 over the River Tronto.
*Ponte Maggiore (&#x27;Great Bridge&#x27;), of medieval origin
*Lombard Palace and the Ercolani Tower (11th-12th centuries)
*Loggia dei Mercanti: a 16th century portico annexed to the church of San Francesco. It was commissioned by the city&#x27;s wool traders guild and finished in 1513.
*Fortezza Pia: a fortress commanding the city, rebuilt in 1560 by Pope Pius IV (whence the name)
*Malatesta Fortress, in a site probably occupied by Roman baths. It was rebuilt by Galeotto I Malatesta, lord of Rimini, during the war against Fermo. The construction, used as a jail until 1978, was enlarged by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger in 1543.
*Grotte dell&#x27;Annunziata (&#x27;Grottoes of the Annunciation&#x27;), a large portico with niches from the 2nd-1st centuries BC, whose original function is unknown (it has been suggested that they could be barracks or slaves dwellings, or a fortified palace)

In Castel Trosino, not far from the city, in 1893 a rare 6th century Lombard necropolis was found.

===Parks and gardens===
*Giardino Botanico, Istituto Tecnico Agrario Statale &quot;Celso Ulpiani&quot;, a botanical garden

==Economy==
Recent industrialization has brought to Ascoli several Italian and multinational companies (YKK, Manuli, Pfizer, Barilla) but the bulk of the economy is made up of small and medium-sized enterprises and by those providing professional services to the area. Agriculture is still important (wheat, olives, fruits).

==Transport==
Ascoli Piceno railway station, opened in 1886, is the southwestern terminus of the San Benedetto del Tronto–Ascoli Piceno railway, a branch of the Adriatic railway.

==Education==
The city is the administrative headquarters and teaching the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Camerino and the International School on Safety and Environmental Protection private university&#x27;s Alma Mater Europaea.

==Culture and sport==
The main festivity is on the first Sunday in August. The historical parade with more than 1500 people dressed in Renaissance costume is held in celebration of Saint Emidio, protector of the city. The parade is followed by a tournament, called &quot;Quintana&quot;, in which six knights, each competing for one of the six neighborhoods in the city, ride the course one after the other trying to hit an effigy of an Arab warrior. Strength and ability are necessary for the knight to win the &quot;palio&quot; or grand prize.

The River Castellano is a site for swimming and bathing in summer.

Founded in 1898, Ascoli Calcio is the main football team in the city. It is one of the oldest teams in Italy and it played for 16 years in Serie A.

<text>The Fokker E.V was a German parasol-monoplane fighter aircraft designed by Reinhold Platz and built by Fokker-Flugzeugwerke. The E.V was the last Fokker design to become operational with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte,&quot; entering service in the last months of World War I. After several fatal accidents due to wing failures, the aircraft was modified and redesignated Fokker D.VIII. Dubbed the &quot;Flying Razor&quot; by post-war pulp-fiction writers, the D.VIII had the distinction of scoring the last aerial victory of the war.

==Design and development==
In early 1918, Fokker produced several rotary-powered monoplane prototypes, submitting V.26 and V.28, small parasol-winged monoplanes with his usual steel-tube fuselages, for the second fighter trials at Adlershof in May/June 1918. V.28 was tested with the 108 kW (145 hp) Oberursel Ur.III and 119 kW (160 hp) Goebel Goe.III, though neither of these engines were ready for operational service. The V.26 used the standard Oberursel Ur.II engine, producing only 82 kW (110 hp). The engine was obsolete but the low drag of the V.26 and light weight meant that it was still quite fast. The Fokker designs were only barely beaten by the Siemens-Schuckert D.III with the complex bi-rotary Siemens-Halske Sh.III engine and the V.26 was ordered into production as the Fokker E.V. Four hundred were ordered immediately with either the Ur.III or Goe.III. Because neither engine was available in any quantity, all production examples mounted the Ur.II.

==Operational history==

The first production E.V aircraft were shipped to &quot;Jasta&quot; 6 in late July. The new monoplane was also delivered to &quot;Jasta&quot; 1, &quot;Jasta&quot; 19, &quot;Jasta&quot; 24 and &quot;Jasta&quot; 36. &quot;Leutnant&quot; Emil Rolff scored the first kill in an E.V on August 17, 1918, but two days later he was killed when his aircraft&#x27;s wing collapsed in flight. After another E.V of &quot;Jasta&quot; 19 crashed, &quot;Idflieg&quot; grounded all E.V aircraft. Pending the investigation of these wing failures, production ceased at the Fokker Flugzeugwerke. According to Fokker, the wing failures were caused by the army technical bureau, which had forced him to modify the original design by over-strengthening the rear main spar. This faulty design allegedly caused the wing to twist and fail. Fokker claimed that this defect was resolved by reverting to his original design.

According to most other accounts, the source of the wing failures lay not in the design, but in shoddy and rushed construction. Fokker had subcontracted construction of the E.V wings to the Gebrüder Perzina Pianoforte Fabrik factory. Due to poor quality control, inferior timber had been used and the spar caps, forming the upper and lower members of each spar assembly, had been placed too far apart during the fabrication. Because the resulting spars were vertically too large to pass through the ribs, excess material was simply planed away from the exposed upper and lower surfaces of the cap pieces, leaving the assembled spars dangerously weak. Other problems included water damage to glued parts, and pins that splintered the spars, rather than securing them.

Tests showed that, when properly constructed, the original E.V wing had a considerable margin of safety. Satisfied that the basic design was safe, &quot;Idflieg&quot; authorized continued production, after personnel changes and improved quality control measures were introduced at the Perzina factory.

Deliveries resumed in October. At the direction of the &quot;Kogenluft&quot; (&quot;Kommandierenden General der Luftstreitkräfte&quot;), &quot;Idflieg&quot; redesignated the modified aircraft D.VIII. The earlier &quot;E.&quot; and &quot;Dr.&quot; prefixes for fighter monoplanes and triplanes, respectively, were abolished and all fighters would henceforth receive the &quot;D.&quot; prefix instead. The D.VIII commenced operations on 24 October with &quot;Jasta&quot; 11. The aircraft proved to be agile and easy to fly. Allied pilots nicknamed it the &quot;Flying Razor&quot;, presumably because the wing resembled the blade of a straight razor.

&quot;Jasta&quot; 5 was issued a D.VIII. The famed ace Erich Lowenhardt performed a test flight of a Fokker EV whilst paying a visit to Jasta 6 in the summer of 1918, but no evidence of him flying this aircraft on any other occasion exists to date.

A total of 381 aircraft were produced, but only some 85 aircraft reached frontline service before the Armistice. Some reached Italy, Japan, the United States, and England as trophies, but most were scrapped in accordance with the terms of the Armistice.

===Postwar===
The Polish Air Force captured 17 aircraft, but only seven (six E.V and one D.VIII) were in airworthy condition. All were used against Soviet forces in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1920. Lieutenant Stefan Stec earned the first kill for the Polish Air Force by shooting down a Ukrainian Nieuport 21 fighter on 29 April 1919. In 1921, the remaining Fokkers were withdrawn from frontline units and transferred to the &quot;Szkoła Obsługi Lotniczej&quot; (Air Personnel School) at Poznań-Ławica airfield.

==Variants==
* V 26 : Initial prototype.
* V 27 : V.26 with Benz Bz.IIIb V8 engine. Participated in the second D-type competition.
* V 28 : Prototype fitted with either a 108 kW (145 hp) Oberursel Ur.III, or a 118 kW (160 hp) Goebel Goe.III rotary engines.
* V 29 : Larger version of the V.27 initially fitted with a Mercedes D.III and later with a BMW IIIa, both inline water-cooled engines. Participated in the third D-type competition.
* V 30 : Single-seat glider modification of V.26.

==Operators==
* Belgian Air Force operated a single captured E.V from 1919 until the early 1920s.
* &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; received 381 aircraft before 11 November 1918.
* &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;
* Royal Netherlands Air Force
* Polish Air Force captured 16 E.V and one D.VIII aircraft, but only 7 were operated. Last E.V was still on inventory in 1924.
* Soviet Air Force captured one aircraft during the Polish-Soviet War and operated it until the mid-1920s.
* United States Army Air Service - Postwar.

<doc id="317549" wikidata="Q7695" url="?curid=317549" title="March (territory)">
<text>In medieval Europe, a march or mark was, in broad terms, any kind of borderland, as opposed to a state&#x27;s &quot;heartland&quot;. More specifically, a march was a border between realms or a neutral buffer zone under joint control of two states in which different laws might apply. In both of these senses, marches served a political purpose, such as providing warning of military incursions or regulating cross-border trade.

Marches gave rise to the titles marquess (masculine) or marchioness (feminine).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;march&quot; derives ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;mereg-&quot;, meaning &quot;edge, boundary&quot;. The root *&quot;mereg-&quot; produced Latin &quot;margo&quot; (&quot;margin&quot;), Old Irish &quot;mruig&quot; (&quot;borderland&quot;), Welsh &quot;bro&quot; (&quot;region, border, valley&quot;) and Persian and Armenian &quot;marz&quot; (&quot;borderland&quot;). The Proto-Germanic &quot;*marko&quot; gave rise to the Old English word &quot;mearc&quot; and Frankish &quot;marka&quot;, as well as Old Norse &quot;mǫrk&quot; meaning &quot;borderland, forest&quot;, and derived from &quot;merki&quot; &quot;boundary, sign&quot;, denoting a borderland between two centres of power.

In Old English, &quot;mark&quot; meant &quot;boundary&quot; or &quot;sign of a boundary&quot;, and the meaning only later evolved to encompass &quot;sign&quot; in general, &quot;impression&quot; and &quot;trace&quot;.

The Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia took its name from West Saxon &quot;mearc&quot; &quot;marches&quot;, which in this instance referred explicitly to the territory&#x27;s position on the Anglo-Saxon frontier with the Romano-British to the west.

During the Frankish Carolingian dynasty, usage of the word spread throughout Europe.

The name &quot;Denmark&quot; preserves the Old Norse cognates &quot;merki&quot; (&quot;boundary&quot;) &quot;mǫrk&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;, &quot;forest&quot;) up to the present. Following the Anschluss, the Nazi German government revived the old name &quot;Ostmark&quot; for Austria.

== Historical examples of marches and marks ==

==Frankish Empire and successor states==

===Marca Hispanica===

In the early ninth century, Charlemagne issued his new kind of land grant, the &quot;aprisio&quot;, which redisposed land belonging to the Imperial &quot;fisc&quot; in deserted areas, and included special rights and immunities that resulted in a range of independence of action. Historians interpret the &quot;aprisio&quot; both as the basis of feudalism and in economic and military terms as a mechanism to entice settlers to a depopulated border region. Such self-sufficient landholders would aid the counts in providing armed men in defense of the Frankish frontier. &quot;Aprisio&quot; grants (the first ones were in Septimania) emanated directly from the Carolingian king, and they reinforced central loyalties, to counterbalance the local power exercised by powerful marcher counts.

After some early setbacks, Emperor Louis the Pious ventured beyond the province of Septimania and eventually took Barcelona from the Moorish emir in 801. Thus he established a foothold in the borderland between the Franks and the Moors. The Carolingian &quot;Hispanic Marches&quot; (&quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;) became a buffer zone ruled by a number of feudal lords, among them the count of Barcelona. It had its own outlying territories, each ruled by a lesser &quot;miles&quot; with armed retainers, who theoretically owed allegiance through a count to the emperor or, with less fealty, to his Carolingian and Ottonian successors. Such territory had a &quot;catlá&quot; (&quot;castellan&quot; or lord of the castle) in an area largely defined by a day&#x27;s ride, and the region became known, like Castile at a later date, as &quot;Catalunya&quot;. Counties in the Pyrenees that appeared in the 9th century, in addition to the County of Barcelona, included Cerdanya, Girona and Urgell.

Communications were arduous, and the power centre was far away. Primitive feudal entities developed, self-sufficient and agrarian, each ruled by a small hereditary military elite. The sequence in the County of Barcelona exhibits a pattern that emerges similarly in marches everywhere: the count is appointed by the king (from 802), the appointment settles on the heirs of a strong count (Sunifred) and the appointment becomes a formality, until the position is declared hereditary (897) and then the count declares independence (by Borrell II in 985). At each stage the &quot;de facto&quot; situation precedes the &quot;de jure&quot; assertion, which merely regularizes an existing fact of life. This is feudalism in the larger landscape.

Some counts aspired to the characteristically Frankish (Germanic) title &quot;Margrave of the Hispanic March&quot;, a &quot;margrave&quot; being a &quot;graf&quot; (&quot;count&quot;) of the march.

The early history of Andorra provides a fairly typical career of another such march county, the only modern survivor in the Pyrenees of the Hispanic Marches.

=== Marches set up by Charlemagne ===

* The Danish March (sometimes regarded as just a series of forts rather than a march) between the Eider and Schlei rivers, against the Danes;
* the Saxon or Nordalbingen march between the Eider and Elbe rivers in modern Holstein, against the Obotrites;
* the Thuringian or Sorbian march on the Saale river, against the Sorbs dwelling behind the &quot;limes sorabicus&quot;;
* the March of Lusatia, March of Meissen, March of Merseburg and March of Zeitz;
* the Franconian march in modern Upper Franconia, against the Czechs;
* the Avar march between Enns river and Wienerwald (the later Eastern March that became the Margraviate of Austria);
* the Pannonian march east of Vienna (divided into &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot;);
* the Carantanian march;
* Steiermark (Styria), established under Charlemagne from a part of Carantania (Carinthia), erected as a border territory against the Avars and Slavs;
* the March of Friuli;
* the Marca Hispanica against the Muslims of Al-Andalus

===France===

The province of France called Marche (), sometimes &quot;Marche Limousine&quot;, was originally a small border district between the Duchy of Aquitaine and the domains of the Frankish kings in central France, partly of Limousin and partly of Poitou.

Its area was increased during the 13th century and remained the same until the French Revolution. Marche was bounded on the north by Berry, on the east by Bourbonnais and Auvergne; on the south by Limousin itself and on the west by Poitou. It embraced the greater part of the modern &quot;département&quot; of Creuse, a considerable part of the northern Haute-Vienne, and a fragment of Indre, up to Saint-Benoît-du-Sault. Its area was about its capital was Charroux and later Guéret, and among its other principal towns were Dorat, Bellac and Confolens.

Marche first appeared as a separate fief about the middle of the 10th century when William III, duke of Aquitaine, gave it to one of his vassals named Boso, who took the title of count. In the 12th century it passed to the family of Lusignan, sometimes also counts of Angoulême, until the death of the childless Count Hugh in 1303, when it was seized by King Philip IV. In 1316 it was made an appanage for his youngest son Charles and a few years later (1327) it passed into the hands of the family of Bourbon.

The family of Armagnac held it from 1435 to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons, and in 1527 it was seized by King Francis I and became part of the domains of the French crown. It was divided into Haute-Marche (i.e. &quot;Upper Marche&quot;) and Basse-Marche (i.e. &quot;Lower Marche&quot;), the estates of the former being in existence until the 17th century. From 1470 until the Revolution the province was under the jurisdiction of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris.

Several communes of France are named similarly:
* Marches, Drôme in the Drôme &quot;département&quot;
* La Marche in the Nièvre &quot;département&quot;

===Germany and Austria===
The Germanic tribes that Romans called Marcomanni, who battled the Romans in the 1st and 2nd centuries, were simply the &quot;men of the borderlands&quot;.
Marches were territorial organisations created as borderlands in the Carolingian Empire and had a long career as purely conventional designations under the Holy Roman Empire. In modern German, &quot;Mark&quot; denotes a piece of land that historically was a borderland, as in the following names:

====Later medieval marches====
*Nordmark, the &quot;Northern March&quot;, the Ottonian empire&#x27;s territorial organisation on the conquered areas of the Wends. In 1134, in the wake of a German crusade against the Wends, the German magnate Albert the Bear was granted the Northern March by the Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II.
* the March of the Billungs on the Baltic coast, stretching approximately from Stettin (Szczecin) to Schleswig;

====Other====
*The Margraviate of Brandenburg, its ruler designated (margrave, literally &quot;march-count&quot;). It was further divided into regions also designated &quot;Mark&quot;:
**Altmark (&quot;Old March&quot;), the western region of the former margraviate, between Hamburg and Magdeburg.
**Mittelmark (&quot;Central March&quot;), the area surrounding Berlin. Today, this region makes up for the bulk of the German federal state of Brandenburg, and thus in modern usage is referred to as Mark Brandenburg.
**Neumark (&quot;New March&quot;) since the 1250s was Brandenburg&#x27;s eastern extremity between Pomerania and Greater Poland. Since 1945, the area is a part of Poland.
**Uckermark, the Brandenburg–Pomeranian borderland. The name is still in use for the region as well as for a Brandenburgian district.
*Mark, a medieval territory that is recalled in the Märkischer Kreis district (formed in 1975) of today&#x27;s North Rhine-Westphalia. The northern portion (north of the Lippe River) is still called Hohe Mark (&quot;Higher Mark&quot;). The former &quot;Lower Mark&quot; (between Ruhr and Lippe rivers) is the present Ruhr area and is no longer called &quot;Mark&quot;. The title, in the form &quot;Count of the Mark&quot;, survived the territory as a subsidiary title of the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
*Ostmark (&quot;Eastern March&quot;) is a modern rendition of the term &quot;marchia orientalis&quot; used in Carolingian documents referring to the area of Lower Austria that was later a &quot;markgraftum&quot; (margraviate or &quot;county of the mark&quot;). &quot;Ostmark&quot; has been variously used to denote Austria, the Saxon Eastern March, or, as &quot; Ostmarkenverein&quot;, the territories Prussia gained in the partitions of Poland.

===Habsburg Empire===

===Italy===

From the Carolingian period onwards the name &quot;marca&quot; begins to appear in Italy, first the Marca Fermana for the mountainous part of Picenum, the Marca Camerinese for the district farther north, including a part of Umbria, and the Marca Anconitana for the former Pentapolis (Ancona). In 1080, the &quot;marca Anconitana&quot; was given in investiture to Robert Guiscard by Pope Gregory VII, to whom the Countess Matilda ceded the marches of Camerino and Fermo.

In 1105, the Emperor Henry IV invested Werner with the whole territory of the three marches, under the name of the March of Ancona. It was afterwards once more recovered by the Church and governed by papal legates as part of the Papal States. The Marche became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. After Italian unification in the 1860s, Austria-Hungary still controlled territory Italian nationalists still claimed as part of Italy. One of these territories was Austrian Littoral, which Italian nationalists began to call the Julian March because of its positioning and as an act of defiance against the hated Austro-Hungarian empire.

&quot;Marche&quot; were repeated on a miniature level, fringing many of the small territorial states of pre-Risorgimento Italy with a ring of smaller dependencies on their borders, which represent territorial &quot;marche&quot; on a small scale. A map of the Duchy of Mantua in 1702 (Braudel 1984, fig 26) reveals the independent, though socially and economically dependent arc of small territories from the principality of Castiglione in the northwest across the south to the duchy of Mirandola southeast of Mantua: the lords of Bozolo, Sabioneta, Dosolo, Guastalla, the count of Novellare.

==Hungary==

In medieval Hungary the system of &quot;gyepű&quot; and &quot;gyepűelve&quot;, effective until the mid-13th century, can be considered as marches even though in its organisation it shows major differences from Western European feudal marches. For one thing, the &quot;gyepű&quot; was not controlled by a Marquess.

The &quot;Gyepű&quot; was a strip of land that was specially fortified or made impassable, while &quot;gyepűelve&quot; was the mostly uninhabited or sparsely inhabited land beyond it. The &quot;gyepűelve&quot; is much more comparable to modern buffer zones than traditional European marches.

Portions of the &quot;gyepű&quot; were usually guarded by tribes who had joined the Hungarian nation and were granted special rights for their services at the borders, such as the Székelys, Pechenegs and Cumans. A ban on settlement north of Niš by the Byzantine Empire in the twelfth century helped to establish uninhabited marchland between the empire&#x27;s territory and Hungary.

The Hungarian &quot;gyepű&quot; originates from the Turkish &quot;yapi&quot; meaning &quot;palisade&quot;. During the 17th and 18th centuries these borderlands were called Markland in the area of Transylvania that bordered with the Kingdom of Hungary and was controlled by a Count or Countess.

==Iberia==
In addition to the Carolingian &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;, Iberia was home to several marches set up by the native states. The future kingdoms of Portugal and Castile were founded as marcher counties intended to protect the Kingdom of León from the Cordoban Emirate, to the south and east respectively.

Likewise, Córdoba set up its own marches as a buffer to the Christian states to the north. The Upper March (&quot;al-Tagr al-A&#x27;la&quot;), centered on Zaragoza, faced the eastern &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; and the western Pyrenees, and included the Distant or Farthest March (&quot;al-Tagr al-Aqsa&quot;). The Middle March (&quot;al-Tagr al-Awsat&quot;), centred on Toledo and later Medinaceli, faced the western Pyrenees and Asturias. The Lower March (&quot;al-Tagr al-Adna&quot;), centred on Mérida and later Badajoz, facing León and Portugal. These too would give rise to Kingdoms, the Taifas of Zaragoza, Toledo, and Badajoz.

==Scandinavia==
Denmark means &quot;the march of the Danes&quot;.

In Norse, &quot;mark&quot; meant &quot;borderlands&quot; and &quot;forest&quot;; in present-day Norwegian and Swedish it has acquired the meaning &quot;ground&quot;, while in Danish it has come to mean &quot;field&quot; or &quot;grassland&quot;.

Markland was the Norse name of an area in North America discovered by Norwegian Vikings. 

The forests surrounding Norwegian cities are called &quot;Marka&quot; – the marches. For example, the forests surrounding Oslo are called Nordmarka, Østmarka and Vestmarka – i.e. the northern, eastern and western marches.

In Norway, there are – or have been – the counties:

* Finnmark, &quot;the borderlands of the Sámi&quot; (known to the Norse as &quot;Finns&quot;)
* Hedmark, &quot;the borderlands of heath&quot;
* Telemark, &quot;the borderlands of the Þela tribe&quot;

In Finland, &quot;mark&quot; occurs in the following placenames in Satakunta:
* Noormarkku (Swedish: Norrmark), a former municipality of Finland
* Pomarkku (Swedish: Påmark), a municipality of Finland
* (Swedish: Södermark), a village in Noormarkku, Finland

In Värmland in Sweden, Nordmark Hundred was the frontier area near the border to Norway. Almost all of it is now a part of Årjäng Municipality. In the Middle Ages the area was called &quot;Nordmarkerna&quot; and was a part of Dalsland and not of Värmland.

==British Isles==

The name of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom in the midlands of England was Mercia. The name &quot;Mercia&quot; comes from the Old English for &quot;boundary folk&quot;, and the traditional interpretation was that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the Welsh and the Anglo-Saxon invaders, although P. Hunter Blair has argued an alternative interpretation that they emerged along the frontier between the Kingdom of Northumbria and the inhabitants of the River Trent valley.

Latinizing the Anglo-Saxon term &quot;mearc&quot;, the border areas between England and Wales were collectively known as the Welsh Marches (&quot;marchia Wallia&quot;), while the native Welsh lands to the west were considered Wales Proper (&quot;pura Wallia&quot;). The Norman lords in the Welsh Marches were to become the new Marcher Lords.

The title &quot;Earl of March&quot; is at least two distinct feudal titles: one in the northern marches, as an alternative title for the Earl of Dunbar (c. 1290 in the Peerage of Scotland); and one, that was held by the family of Mortimer (1328 in the Peerage of England), in the west Welsh Marches.

The Scottish Marches is a term for the border regions on both sides of the border between England and Scotland. From the Norman conquest of England until the reign of King James VI of Scotland, who also became King James I of England, border clashes were common and the monarchs of both countries relied on Marcher Lords to defend the frontier areas known as the Marches. They were hand-picked for their suitability for the challenges the responsibilities presented.

Patrick Dunbar, 8th Earl of Dunbar, a descendant of the Earls of Northumbria was recognized in the end of the 13th century to use the name March as his earldom in Scotland, otherwise known as Dunbar, Lothian, and Northumbrian border.

Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, Regent of England together with Isabella of France during the minority of her son, Edward III, was a usurper who had deposed, and allegedly arranged the murder of, King Edward II. He was created an earl in September 1328 at the height of his &quot;de facto&quot; rule. His wife was Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville, whose mother, Jeanne of Lusignan was one of the heiresses of the French Counts of La Marche and Angouleme.

His family, Mortimer Lords of Wigmore, had been border lords and leaders of defenders of Welsh marches for centuries. He selected &quot;March&quot; as the name of his earldom for several reasons: Welsh marches referred to several counties, whereby the title signified superiority compared to usual single county-based earldoms. Mercia was an ancient kingdom. His wife&#x27;s ancestors had been Counts of La Marche and Angouleme in France.

In Ireland, a hybrid system of marches existed which was condemned as barbaric at the time. The Irish marches constituted the territory between English and Irish-dominated lands, which appeared as soon as the English did and were called by King John to be fortified. By the 14th century, they had become defined as the land between The Pale and the rest of Ireland. Local Anglo-Irish and Gaelic chieftains who acted as powerful spokespeople were recognised by the Crown and given a degree of independence. Uniquely, the keepers of the marches were given the power to terminate indictments. In later years, wardens of the Irish marches took Irish tenants.

== Titles ==
Marquis, marchese and margrave (&quot;Markgraf&quot;) all had their origins in feudal lords who held trusted positions in the borderlands. The English title was a foreign importation from France, tested out tentatively in 1385 by Richard II, but not naturalized until the mid-15th century, and now more often spelled &quot;marquess&quot;.

===Armenia===
The specific subdivisions of Armenia are each called &quot;marz, մարզ&quot; (pl. &quot;marzer, մարզեր&quot;), a loanword from Persian.

===Byzantine Empire===
===China===
The Chinese concept of March is called &quot;Fan&quot; (藩), referring to feudatory domains and petty kingdoms on the borderlands of the empire.

In their initial development during the later Zhou dynasty, the commanderies (&quot;jùn&quot;, 郡) functioned as marches, ranking below the dukes&#x27; and kings&#x27; original fiefs and below the more secure and populous counties (&quot;xiàn&quot;). As the commanderies formed the front lines between the major states, however, their military strength and strategic importance were typically much greater than the counties&#x27;. Over time, however, the commanderies were eventually developed into regular provinces and then discontinued entirely during the Tang dynasty reforms.

===Japan===
The European concept of &quot;marches&quot; applies just as well to the fief of Matsumae clan on the southern tip of Hokkaidō which was at Japan&#x27;s northern border with the Ainu people of Hokkaidō, known as Ezo at the time. In 1590, this land was granted to the Kakizaki clan, who took the name Matsumae from then on. The Lords of Matsumae, as they are sometimes called, were exempt from owing rice to the &quot;shōgun&quot; in tribute, and from the &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot; system established by Tokugawa Ieyasu, under which most lords (&quot;daimyōs&quot;) had to spend half the year at court (in the capital of Edo).

By guarding the border, rather than conquering or colonizing Ezo, the Matsumae, in essence, made the majority of the island an Ainu reservation. This also meant that Ezo, and the Kurile Islands beyond, were left essentially open to Russian colonization. However, the Russians never did colonize Ezo, and the marches were officially eliminated during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, when the Ainu came under Japanese control, and Ezo was renamed Hokkaidō, and annexed to Japan.

===Persia (Sassanid Empire)===
===Roman Empire===
===Ukraine===
&quot;Ukraine&quot;, from the Moscow-centric Russian viewpoint,
functioned as a &quot;borderland&quot; or &quot;march&quot; and arguably could have gained its current name, which is derived from a Slavic term that can take on the same meaning (see above for similar in Slovenia, etc.), ultimately from this function. This, though, was merely a continuation of a semi-formal arrangement with the Poles, before escalating feuds, political infighting in Poland, and religious differences (mainly Eastern Orthodox vs. Roman Catholic) saw a loose coalition of Ukrainian lords and independent landowners collectively known as the Cossacks shift to ally with the Russian Empire.

The Cossacks became a significant part of Russian military history in their role as military border/buffer-troops in the Wild Fields of Ukraine. The Tatar slave raids in East Slavic lands brought considerable devastation and depopulation to this area prior to the rise of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. As settlement advanced and the borders moved, the Tsars transferred or formed Cossack units to perform similar functions on other borderlands/marches further south and east in (for example) the Kuban and in Siberia, forming (for example) the Black Sea Cossack Host, the Kuban Cossack Host and the Amur Cossack Host.

<text>The UCPH Department of Computer Science () is a department in the Faculty of Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). It is the longest established department of Computer Science in Denmark and was founded in 1970 by Turing Award winner Peter Naur. As of 2021, it employs 82 academic staff, 126 research staff and 38 support staff. It is consistently ranked the top Computer Science department in the Nordic countries, and in 2017 was placed 9th worldwide by the Academic Ranking of World Universities.

== History ==
DIKU has its roots at the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where in 1963, the first computer was bought.
In 1969, Peter Naur became the first professor in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, and in 1970, DIKU was officially established its own department.

== Research ==
As of 2021, the department is home to 82 academic staff, 126 research staff and 38 support staff. Research is organised into seven research sections:
* The Algorithms and Complexity Section, headed by Mikkel Thorup, who conduct basic algorithms research, as well as research on data structures and computational complexity
* The Human‐Centered Computing Section, headed by Kasper Hornbæk, who research human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, as well as health informatics
* The Image Section, headed by Kim Steenstrup Pedersen, who work on image processing including medical image processing, computer vision, physics based animation and robotics.
* The Machine Learning Section, headed by Christina Lioma, researching theoretical machine learning, information retrieval, and machine learning in biology
* The Natural Language Processing Section, headed by Isabelle Augenstein, who conduct research on core natural language processing, natural language understanding, computational linguistics, as well as multimodal learning 
* The Programming Languages and Theory of Computation section, headed by Martin Elsman, researching programming languages, theory of computation, computer security, and approaches to financial transparency
* The Software, Data, People &amp; Society Section, headed by Thomas Troels Hildebrandt, who work on decentralised systems, data management systems, and process modelling

== Teaching ==
The department offers programmes at BSc as well as MSc level, both in core computer science and in interdisciplinary subjects. Bachelor&#x27;s programmes are 3-year programmes and mostly taught in Danish, whereas Master&#x27;s programmes are 2-year programmes and taught in English. In 2020, DIKU enrolled 610 new Bachelor&#x27;s students and 136 new Master&#x27;s students.
As of 2021, DIKU offers the following study programmes:
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Machine Learning and Data Science
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Computer Science and Economy
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Communication and IT
* Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Health and IT
* Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science
* Part-time Master of Science (MSc) in Computer Science
* Master of Science (MSc) in IT and Cognition
* Master of Science (MSc) in Communication and IT

In addition, the department awards the research degree Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). PhD students are enrolled in the Faculty of Science&#x27;s Doctoral School for a typical study period of between three and four years.

== Location ==
DIKU is based at University Park in Copenhagen, part of the university&#x27;s North Campus. Its building complex comprises the former Department of Anatomy. The building was completed in 1942 to design by Kaj Gottlob.

The Human-Centered Computing Section is located in Sigurdsgade, close to the North Campus.

== Student life ==
An important social event is the DIKU revue which is held each year in June. The DIKU revue is always in competition with the physics revue and never misses an opportunity to computer-animate the complete and utter destruction of the physics institute at the H. C. Ørsted Institute.

As something unique among the institutes of Copenhagen University, the DIKU cantine is entirely student driven and open 24 hours. It is the natural hub for all social events on DIKU.

The two largest social events are the DIKU revue and the &quot;Julefrokost&quot; (Christmas lunch) of the canteen.

== Notable faculty ==
* Corinna Cortes, who co-developed the highly influential supervised machine learning method support vector machines, has been an adjunct professor at the department since 2011.
* Mikkel Thorup, best known for his work on shortest path problem in undirected graphs, has been a professor at the department since 2013.
* Kasper Hornbæk, who won a SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award for his work on usability in human-computer interaction, has been a professor at the department since 2014.
* Serge Belongie, known for his work on object recognition and image segmentation, has been a professor at the department since 2021.
* Isabelle Augenstein, known for her research on natural language processing, and for being appointed the youngest female full professor in Denmark in October 2022.

== Notable alumni ==
* Peter Naur, a Turing Award recipient, was a professor at the department between 1969 and 1998.
* Per Brinch Hansen, a IEEE Computer Pioneer Award winner, was a professor at the department between 1984 and 1987.
* Mads Tofte, the first managing director of the IT University of Copenhagen and co-developer of the Standard ML programming language, who graduated with a MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics in 1984.
* Michael Seifert, a Danish computer programmer who developed the popular multiplayer text-based role-playing game DikuMud, was a BSc then MSc student at the department from 1990 to 1996.

== Miscellaneous ==
The domain codice_1 was registered on October 29, 1987, and was one of the first .dk domain names to be registered.

The popular DikuMUD codebase was developed at DIKU in March 1990, and derives its name from the institute.

In the 1994 Danish thriller Nattevagten (Nightwatch) directed by Ole Bornedal, the main entrance and stairwell of the institute was used as a main location.

<doc id="317552" wikidata="Q331481" url="?curid=317552" title="Cover (topology)">
<text>In mathematics, and more particularly in set theory, a cover (or covering) of a set formula_1 is a family of subsets of formula_1 whose union is all of formula_1. More formally, if formula_4 is an indexed family of subsets formula_5 (indexed by the set formula_6), then formula_7 is a cover of formula_1 if
formula_9
Thus the collection formula_10 is a cover of formula_1 if each element of formula_1 belongs to at least one of the subsets formula_13. 

== Definition ==
Covers are commonly used in the context of topology. If the set formula_1 is a topological space, then a cover formula_15 of formula_1 is a collection of subsets formula_17 of formula_1 whose union is the whole space formula_1. In this case formula_15 is said to cover formula_1, or that the sets formula_22 cover formula_1.

If formula_24 is a (topological) subspace of formula_1, then a cover of formula_24 is a collection of subsets formula_27 of formula_1 whose union contains formula_24. That is, formula_7 is a cover of formula_24 if
formula_32
Here, formula_24 may be covered with either sets in formula_24 itself or sets in the parent space formula_1.

A cover of formula_36 is said to be locally finite if every point of formula_36 has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many sets in the cover. Formally, formula_38 is locally finite if, for any formula_39, there exists some neighborhood formula_40 of formula_41 such that the set
formula_42
is finite. A cover of formula_36 is said to be &quot;point finite&quot; if every point of formula_36 is contained in only finitely many sets in the cover. A cover is point finite if locally finite, though the converse is not necessarily true.

== Subcover ==
Let formula_15 be a cover of a topological space formula_36. A &quot;subcover&quot; of formula_15 is a subset of formula_15 that still covers formula_36. The cover formula_15 is said to be an &quot;&quot; if each of its members is an open set. That is, each formula_51 is contained in formula_52, where formula_52 is the topology on &quot;X&quot;).

A simple way to get a subcover is to omit the sets contained in another set in the cover. Consider specifically open covers. Let formula_54 be a topological basis of formula_1 and formula_56 be an open cover of formula_1. First, take formula_58. Then formula_59 is a refinement of formula_56. Next, for each formula_61 one may select a formula_62 containing formula_6 (requiring the axiom of choice). Then formula_64 is a subcover of formula_65 Hence the cardinality of a subcover of an open cover can be as small as that of any topological basis. Hence, second countability implies space is Lindelöf.

== Refinement ==
A refinement of a cover formula_66 of a topological space formula_1 is a new cover formula_68 of formula_1 such that every set in formula_68 is contained in some set in formula_66. Formally,

:formula_72 is a refinement of formula_73 if for all formula_74 there exists formula_75 such that formula_76

In other words, there is a refinement map formula_77 satisfying formula_78 for every formula_79 This map is used, for instance, in the Čech cohomology of formula_1.

Every subcover is also a refinement, but the opposite is not always true. A subcover is made from the sets that are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any sets that are subsets of the sets in the cover.

The refinement relation on the set of covers of formula_1 is transitive and reflexive, i.e. a Preorder. It is never asymmetric for formula_82.

Generally speaking, a refinement of a given structure is another that in some sense contains it. Examples are to be found when partitioning an interval (one refinement of formula_83 being formula_84), considering topologies (the standard topology in Euclidean space being a refinement of the trivial topology). When subdividing simplicial complexes (the first barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex is a refinement), the situation is slightly different: every simplex in the finer complex is a face of some simplex in the coarser one, and both have equal underlying polyhedra.

Yet another notion of refinement is that of star refinement.

==Compactness==
The language of covers is often used to define several topological properties related to compactness. A topological space formula_36 is said to be:
* compact if every open cover has a finite subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a finite refinement);
* Lindelöf if every open cover has a countable subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a countable refinement);
* metacompact: if every open cover has a point-finite open refinement; and
* paracompact: if every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement.

For some more variations see the above articles.

==Covering dimension==
A topological space &quot;X&quot; is said to be of covering dimension &quot;n&quot; if every open cover of &quot;X&quot; has a point-finite open refinement such that no point of &quot;X&quot; is included in more than &quot;n+&quot;1 sets in the refinement and if &quot;n&quot; is the minimum value for which this is true. If no such minimal &quot;n&quot; exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

<doc id="317555" wikidata="Q686598" url="?curid=317555" title="Close to the Edge">
<text>Close to the Edge is the fifth studio album by English progressive rock band Yes, released in the UK on 8 September 1972 and in the US on 13 September 1972 by Atlantic Records. It is their last album of the 1970s to feature original drummer Bill Bruford, who found the album particularly laborious to make and felt unable to contribute better ideas, which influenced his decision to join King Crimson once recording had finished.

After scoring a critical and commercial hit with their previous album &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971) and touring the album, Yes regrouped with producer and engineer Eddy Offord to record a follow-up. The album&#x27;s centrepiece is the 18-minute title track, with lyrics inspired by the Hermann Hesse novel &quot;Siddhartha&quot;. Side two contains two non-conceptual tracks, the folk-inspired &quot;And You and I&quot; and the comparatively straightforward rocker &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover, designed by Roger Dean, marked the debut of the band&#x27;s &quot;bubble&quot; logo.

&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; became the band&#x27;s greatest commercial success at the time of release, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 3 in the US, where it sold over one million copies. The album&#x27;s 1972-1973 tour comprised over 90 dates worldwide and marked the debut of drummer Alan White, who joined the band three days before it started. It was reissued in 1994, 2003, and 2013; the latter release includes previously unreleased tracks and new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes. &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; has since received widespread critical acclaim; in 2020, it was ranked 445th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Background ==
By late 1971, Yes&#x27;s line-up comprised lead vocalist Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Bill Bruford, guitarist Steve Howe, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman. In March 1972, they wrapped their six-month Fragile Tour of the UK and North America in support of their fourth album, &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971). The album became their biggest commercial and critical hit since their formation, helped by the track &quot;Roundabout&quot; receiving considerable airplay on American radio. On 1 and 2 February 1972, during one of the tour&#x27;s rest periods, the band booked time at Advision Studios in London to put down some tracks for a follow-up record. When touring finished, they took another break before they entered rehearsals at the Una Billings School of Dance in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush in May 1972. Although some arrangements were worked out and put onto tape during this time, none of the tracks were fully written at this stage, leaving the group to devise the rest of the songs in the studio and learn to play them through afterwards. On several occasions the arrangements that Yes had started to assemble were so complex that they were forgotten by the time the next day&#x27;s session began. This caused the band to record each rehearsal for future reference. Bruford devised the album&#x27;s title to reflect the state of the band at the time.

== Recording ==
By June 1972, Yes had worked out songs for the album and returned to Advision to record it. Eddy Offord, who had worked with Yes since &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970) and had mixed their live sound on the &quot;Fragile&quot; tour, assumed his role as audio engineer and producer, sharing his production duties with the band. Having worked on the band&#x27;s live sound, Offord wished to recreate, in the studio, the high feeling the band had on nights when they performed well in concert. To attempt this, he got their road crew to construct a large stage in the studio for the band to perform on; he noted that Bruford&#x27;s drums resonated with the wooden platform and made the band sound &quot;more live&quot;. The studio also housed a booth-like structure constructed of wooden boards which Howe performed in to enhance his sound further. In one incident, the band decided to use a particular take for a track, but realised that the studio&#x27;s cleaning staff had put the tape in the rubbish. A scramble in the bins outside the studio ensued, and the missing piece was found and inserted into the master. Around halfway through recording, Anderson decided to walk home from the studio after one exhausting session ended at dawn. He broke down in tears upon arriving, because he decided that he could &quot;officially call myself a musician now&quot;, and wrote it on the occupation section of his passport which he had previously left blank until that point.
During their month at Advision, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter and band biographer Chris Welch paid a visit to observe the group at work. Welch described a stressful atmosphere, coupled with &quot;outbursts of anarchy&quot; from Bruford, Howe, and Wakeman and disagreement from each member after one mix of a song section was complete. Welch sensed that the band were not a cohesive unit, with Anderson and Howe the only ones who knew what direction the album was to take, leaving the rest adding bits and pieces &quot;to a vast jigsaw of sound&quot;, to which Squire and Offord were the two who helped put their idea into shape. Wakeman and Bruford, to Welch, remained &quot;innocent bystanders&quot; in the matter. In one instance, Welch arrived at the studio to hear a preview of a completed passage that took several days of round-the-clock work to produce. He heard a dull thud, to find that Offord had fallen asleep on top of the mixing console from exhaustion, &quot;leaving music from the spinning tape deck blaring at an intolerable level&quot;. Howe later disagreed with Welch&#x27;s description, and said his report might have been based on Bruford&#x27;s comments at the time. Howe said that the main source of tension was between Squire and Bruford, particularly when Squire suggested that Bruford alter his drumming to accommodate bass parts that Squire wanted to play.

Bruford found &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; particularly difficult to write and record with the rest of the band, calling the process torturous and like &quot;climbing Mount Everest&quot;. He became frustrated with the band&#x27;s happy, diatonic music and favoured more jazz-oriented and improvisational compositions. This became an issue with the group&#x27;s way of composing and recording, as each section of a track was played through and discussed section by section. Bruford said: &quot;Every instrument was up for democratic election, and everybody had to run an election campaign on every issue. It was horrible, it was incredibly unpleasant, and unbelievably hard work&quot;. Squire became a growing source of discontent for Bruford, citing his frequent lateness for rehearsals and his way of working. In one instance, Bruford fell asleep on a sofa in the studio control room while Squire was &quot;poring over a couple of knobs on the [mixing] desk&quot; to determine how much equalisation should be applied to his bass tracks, only to wake up several hours later, finding Squire &quot;in the same place, still considering the relative position of the two knobs&quot;. Bruford was constantly encouraged by Anderson to write, something he felt grateful for years later, but by the time recording was complete, he felt he had done his best on &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and could not offer better arrangements. &quot;So then I knew I needed a breath of fresh air&quot;, and left the group.

== Songs ==
=== Side one ===
&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; was written by Anderson and Howe, both of whom also share lyrical credits. Its 18-minute length marked the longest track Yes had recorded at the time. Anderson gained initial inspiration from a moment in his hotel room during the Fragile Tour when he was reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien while listening to Symphony Nos. 6 and 7 by Jean Sibelius, one of his favourite composers. The seventh struck Anderson the most as he noticed that its main theme was introduced some time in the composition which influenced how &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; was shaped. He studied No. 7 for the remainder of the tour; roughly halfway, he discussed his initial ideas with Howe. During a break the two resumed writing at Howe&#x27;s home in Hampstead, north London, at which point Howe devised the lyric &quot;Close to the edge, round by the corner&quot;, itself inspired when he had lived in Battersea, an area beside the River Thames. Anderson was inspired to base its theme and lyrics on &quot;Siddhartha&quot; (1922) by German novelist Hermann Hesse, and revised the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;three or four&quot; times, saying &quot;it&#x27;s all metaphors&quot;. The lyrics for the concluding verse were based on a dream he once had about the &quot;passing on from this world to another... yet feeling so fantastic about it that death never frightened me ever since&quot;.

The song&#x27;s tape loop introduction, a combination of keyboard and nature sounds, including flowing water and bird chirps recorded on location, measured approximately 40 feet in length and took two days to record. Anderson was inspired to include the bird sounds, and the instrumental section in &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down&quot;, from hearing &quot;Sonic Seasonings&quot; (1972), an electronic ambient album by Wendy Carlos. Anderson suggested starting with an improvised group jam, which the group saw as adventurous and is one of the reasons why the band comes in out of nowhere on the final take. The track was assembled in pieces throughout, as Bruford described, &quot;in ten, twelve, sixteen-bar sections&quot;. Its introduction came about after the band had toured with fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra; someone in the band suggested having the piece open with improvisation with pre-arranged pauses.

The music played during the &quot;Close to the edge, round by the corner&quot; section was originally a same-titled song that Howe had put together several years prior, in part based on the longest day of the year. Anderson and Howe agreed this section fit best with an Anderson composition titled &quot;Total Mass Retain&quot;, thus joining the two ideas together. Howe had prepared another song, of which its middle eight was adapted into the &quot;In her white lace&quot; section of &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down&quot;. Wakeman&#x27;s organ solo was written by Howe for the guitar originally, but he thought the arrangement sounded better on the organ. It is played on the pipe organ at St Giles-without-Cripplegate church in Barbican, London. The band produced a take of the section after the church organ solo that they were satisfied with, but when it came to inserting it into the final mix, Offord had inserted the take he thought was the right one and placed the good take in the bin of scrapped tape. The result caused a noticeable tape edit that had to stay in the mix as the task of reproducing the sound exactly would have been a near impossibility. Anderson sings the final verses in G minor, which had to be scaled down to F on stage due to the strain on his voice.

=== Side two ===
&quot;And You and I&quot; originated as a more folk-oriented song that Anderson developed which was based around the idea of presenting a theme and building it as the track progresses. The track is in four sections; its style and themes were worked on by Howe, Bruford, and Squire, the only track on the album that credits Bruford and Squire as writers. Anderson pitched his ideas for the track while strumming chords on a guitar, singing the section where the first lyric comes in. It was a theme that Howe particularly enjoyed and was keen to develop. While introducing the song on tour, Anderson said its working title was &quot;The Protest Song&quot;. In its original form, the song had an extended ending that Welch described as &quot;a shattering climax&quot;, but its popularity amongst the band decreased over time, leading to their decision to cut it from the final version. In a newspaper review of a Yes show in August 1972, the writer paraphrased that Anderson calls the song &quot;a tale of the search for truth and purity between two people&quot;. Anderson himself said it is similar to that of a hymn, in the sense of feeling &quot;secure in the knowledge of knowing there is somebody... God maybe&quot;. The track starts with Howe on a Guild 12-string acoustic that belonged to Squire, initially playing improvised harmonics and saying &quot;Okay&quot; in response to Offord who signalled to Howe that he was ready to record. The moment was not part of the song, but Offord liked it and persuaded the band to keep it in. &quot;The Preacher, the Teacher&quot; was developed in a single afternoon. Anderson suggested the idea of it having a more country feel, to which Howe and Squire came up with respective guitar and bass arrangements that Anderson thought &quot;sat together so sweet&quot;.

&quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; is a more straightforward rock song that developed from an idea that Anderson had on an acoustic guitar. He did not have the entire track worked out, so the rest of the group took the sections he needed help with and discussed what riffs best suited it as it lacked one strong enough to carry the song. Wakeman received a writing credit on the song, and has a solo played on a Thomas Goff model harpsichord. He recalled Goff visiting the studio and directing Offord on the best way to set up and record the instrument. In terms of its lyrics, Anderson noted the song is a collection of &quot;interesting words, though it does relate to the dreams of clear summer days&quot;. He claimed &quot;khatru&quot; translates to &quot;as you wish&quot; in the Yemeni dialect of Arabic, but had no idea what the word meant at the time until he asked someone to look up its meaning. Howe said the group were inspired by Igor Stravinsky when it came to the end of the song, &quot;by having that staccato pounding and at the same time throwing those accents on voice and drums and having me driving through it with that constant guitar motif.&quot; When it came to recording Howe&#x27;s ending guitar solo, one experiment involved Offord placing one microphone by the amplifier and having his assistant swing a second microphone around the room to create a Doppler effect. John Frusciante of Red Hot Chili Peppers has cited the closing solo as an influence for his own guitar solo on &quot;Get on Top&quot;. He said: &quot;The band sound is really big – and they&#x27;re playing fast – and then this clean guitar comes out over the top. It&#x27;s really beautiful, like it&#x27;s on its own sort of shelf. For &#x27;Get on Top&#x27;, I wanted to play something that would create a contrast between the solo and the background.&quot;

== Artwork ==
&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; was packaged with a gatefold sleeve designed and illustrated by Roger Dean, who had also designed the cover for &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971). It marked the first appearance of the band&#x27;s bubble logotype, placed on top of a simple front cover design of a linear colour gradient from black to green. Dean came up with the logo without the band&#x27;s knowledge and before they had started work on &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. He sketched it out during a train journey from London to Brighton with the idea that the three letters could be put together &quot;in an interesting way&quot;. Upon Dean&#x27;s arrival in Brighton, he had finished it. Dean pitched the idea of having the title lettering silver-blocked like a traditional book but it never materialised. Dean&#x27;s logo has been described as a &quot;calligraphed colophon&quot;.

In his original design, Dean wanted the album to resemble the quality of a gold embossed book and have a leather texture as he had owned many leather-bound sketchbooks. Dean gained inspiration for the artwork during a visit to Haystacks, a tall hill in the Lake District. He took a photograph at its summit and observing the many tarns surrounding it. &quot;I was imagining this lake as something grander [...] How could it sustain itself on the tippy top of a mountain?&quot; The sleeve includes pictures of the group and Offord that were photographed by Dean and Martyn Adelman, who had played with Squire in the late 1960s as a member of The Syn. Dean wrote the sleeve&#x27;s text and lyric sheet by hand. On reflection on the album&#x27;s design, Dean said: &quot;There were a couple of ideas that merged there. It was of a waterfall constantly refreshing itself, pouring from all sides of the lake, but where was the water coming from? I was looking for an image to portray that&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; was released on 8 September 1972 in the UK and on 13 September 1972 in the US, six weeks into the band&#x27;s 1972–73 world tour to promote the album. It became their biggest commercial success since their formation, reaching number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the United States and number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. In the Netherlands, the album went to number one. The album received 450,000 advanced orders in the United States. On 30 October 1972, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for 500,000 copies sold in the United States. Atlantic Records owner Ahmet Ertegun presented the group with their gold disc award at a restaurant in New York City on 20 November, where their manager, Brian Lane, announced the band&#x27;s new five-year contract with Atlantic. The album continued to sell, and was certified platinum for one million copies sold on 10 April 1998.

Yes released &quot;And You and I&quot; as a two-part single in the United States in October 1972. In the United Kingdom, the song was released in its entirety with &quot;Roundabout&quot; on its B-side. It peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in the United States for the week of 16 December 1972. A single edit of &quot;Total Mass Retain&quot; was released as the B-side to the group&#x27;s non-album single, a rendition of &quot;America&quot; made famous by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, released on 17 July 1972.

=== Reissues ===
In 1987, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; was reissued by Atlantic Records on CD in the United States and Europe. Another issue of the album was digitally remastered by Joe Gastwirt in 1994. In 2003, the album was reissued again on disc in an expanded and remastered edition by Rhino and Elektra Records. Included were two previously unreleased tracks: an alternate version of &quot;And You and I&quot;, an early run-through of &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, and Yes&#x27;s 1972 single &quot;America&quot; with its b-side, an edit of &quot;Total Mass Retain&quot;.

In 2013, two new editions of the album were released. Steve Hoffman of Audio Fidelity Records conducted a remastering in both CD and Super Audio CD formats. For the Panegyric label, Steven Wilson used the original multi-track recordings to produce a &quot;2013 stereo mix&quot;, a 5.1 surround sound mix, and an &quot;original stereo mix&quot; from a flat transfer of the LP, in both a CD and DVD-Audio and CD and Blu-ray Disc package. Bonus tracks include single edits, an early rough mix of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, and instrumental versions of the album&#x27;s three tracks.

In January 2025, a seven-disc super deluxe edition of &quot;Close To the Edge&quot; was announced, which is set to release on 7 March. The reissue will feature a remaster of the original album, instrumental mixes, and a new Steven Wilson, 5.1 surround sound, Dolby Atmos, and stereo mix. The box set will also include three discs of rarities and live material.

== Reception and legacy ==

&quot;Close to the Edge&quot; received favourable reviews among critics at the time of release in magazines and newspapers. &quot;New Musical Express&quot; printed a more mixed review from Ian MacDonald on 2 September 1972. He thought the group were &quot;not just close to the edge, they&#x27;ve gone right over it&quot;, though they &quot;played their God-damned guts out&quot; on the album which he called &quot;an attempt to overwhelm us which resulted in only unmemorable meaninglessness&quot;. MacDonald concluded: &quot;On every level but the ordinary aesthetic one, it&#x27;s one of the most remarkable records pop has yet produced&quot;. American music magazine &quot;Cashbox&quot; hailed the album as &quot;a recording masterpiece&quot;. In a positive review, &quot;Billboard&quot; selected the album in its weekly &quot;Billboard Pick&quot; feature, noting that Yes had &quot;progressed to the point where they are light years beyond their emulators, proving to be no mere flash in the pan. The sound tapestries they weave are dainty fragments, glimpses of destinies yet to be formed, times that fade like dew drops in the blurriness of desires half-remembered. All involved deserve praise and thanks, this being not a mere audio experience, transcending the medium it brings all senses into play.&quot;

Henry Medoza opened his review for &quot;The San Bernardino Sun&quot; with: &quot;Not since ... &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; has there been one side on an album that expressed such a complete and exciting a musical thought as side one&quot;, and thought it presented the group with a new level of sophistication. He praised the group&#x27;s vocal harmonies and Bruford&#x27;s &quot;deep irregular bass drum&quot; on the opening of the title track, but picked its third section as the most interesting with the trading vocals, Wakeman&#x27;s &quot;dream-like&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; organ playing. Mendoza described side two as more &quot;uninspiring&quot; than the first, but praised the vocals and harmonies on both tracks, noting they sound like its own instrument on &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;. The &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot; printed another positive review by Jon Clemens. He called the title track a &quot;virtual sound trip&quot;, moving &quot;quickly, loudly, in a frenzy&quot; that &quot;contrasts brilliantly&quot; during &quot;I Get Up, I Get Down&quot;, and praises the vocals during the section. Clemens thought highly of Howe and Wakeman&#x27;s interplay throughout, but thought the group&#x27;s tendency to change tempo frequently risks distracting the listener. For the &quot;San Mateo Times&quot;, Peter J. Barsocchini thought the album is &quot;good in concept and performance&quot;, with the title track &quot;quite likely the best piece of music&quot; the band had recorded in its career. &quot;And You and I&quot;, Barsocchini thought, is &quot;an interesting meshing of acoustic and electronic music&quot; that is &quot;tightly, integrally produced&quot;. To him, &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; was comparable to their &quot;Fragile&quot; album that does not further the group&#x27;s sound like the album&#x27;s other two cuts do.

The album has continued to receive many positive retrospective reviews. In his review for AllMusic, Dave Thompson gave the album five stars out of five, hailing it as a &quot;flawless masterpiece&quot;. Paul Stump&#x27;s 1997 &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; asserted that &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, with its equal measures of ambition and heartfelt playing, &quot;even today draws grudging respect from Yes&#x27;s most trenchant critics.&quot; In a special edition of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; magazines published in 2005, &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; came in at number 3 in its 40 Cosmic Rock Albums list. The record is also listed in the musical reference publication &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; by Robert Dimery. In a reader&#x27;s choice of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time for &quot;Guitar World&quot;, the album came in at number 67. &quot;Sound &amp; Vision&quot; ranked it number 32 on its Top 50 Albums of All Time list. The album came in at number 5 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the top 50 greatest progressive rock albums of all time. It was voted number 130 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums. The album came in at number 1 on a list of the 100 greatest progressive rock albums of all time by &quot;Prog&quot; magazine. It also made &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the top 500 greatest albums of all time at number 445.

== Bruford&#x27;s departure and tour ==
On 19 July 1972, once recording for the album was complete, Bruford left the band to join King Crimson. He offered to tour with Yes for the remainder of the year, yet Howe wanted him to leave sooner as he no longer had the commitment. Howe later regretted his decision as he would have enjoyed playing the album live with Bruford at the time. His replacement was Alan White of the Plastic Ono Band and Terry Reid&#x27;s group. As he played on &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; but left before the subsequent tour, Bruford was obliged by management to share his album royalties with White and claims that Lane enforced a compensation payment of $10,000 from him for leaving. Years later, White agreed to return his share of the royalties upon Bruford&#x27;s request. The band embarked on their largest yet world tour to promote the album. White had one full rehearsal with the band prior to the tour&#x27;s start on 30 July 1972, which saw the band play a total of 95 concerts in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia. The tour ended in April 1973. Recordings from the tour, both film and audio, were released on the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Yessongs&quot; (1973), and concert film of the same name, filmed at the Rainbow Theatre in London and released in 1975.

<doc id="317557" wikidata="Q152395" url="?curid=317557" title="Feast of Corpus Christi">
<text>The Feast of Corpus Christi (), also known as the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, is a liturgical solemnity celebrating the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist; the feast is observed by the Latin Church, in addition to certain Western Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican churches. Two months earlier, the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is observed on Maundy Thursday in a sombre atmosphere leading to Good Friday. The liturgy on that day also commemorates Christ&#x27;s washing of the disciples&#x27; feet, the institution of the priesthood, and the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.

The feast of Corpus Christi was proposed by Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church, to Pope Urban IV, in order to create a feast focused solely on the Holy Eucharist, emphasizing the joy of the Eucharist being the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ. Having recognized in 1264 the authenticity of the Eucharistic Miracle of Bolsena, on input of Aquinas, the pontiff, then living in Orvieto, established the feast of Corpus Christi as a Solemnity and extended it to the whole Roman Catholic Church.

The feast is liturgically celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday or, &quot;where the Solemnity of The Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ is not a holy day of obligation, it is assigned to the Sunday after the Most Holy Trinity as its proper day&quot;.

At the end of Holy Mass, there is often a procession of the Blessed Sacrament, generally displayed in a monstrance. The procession is followed by the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. A notable Eucharistic procession is that presided over by the Pope each year in Rome, where it begins at the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran and passes to the Basilica of Saint Mary Major, where it concludes with the aforementioned Benediction. Corpus Christi wreaths, which are made of flowers, are hung on the doors and windows of the Christian faithful, in addition to being erected in gardens and fields.

The celebration of the feast was suppressed in many Protestant churches (especially those of a Calvinist persuasion) during the Reformation for theological reasons, because it celebrated the doctrine of the real presence. Though Lutheranism maintained the confession of the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist via a sacramental union, in contrast, the Reformed affirmed a spiritual (pneumatic) presence. Today, most Protestant denominations do not recognize the feast day, with exception of certain Lutheran churches and the Church of England, the latter of which abolished it in 1548 as the English Reformation progressed, but later reintroduced it. Some Anglican churches now observe Corpus Christi, sometimes under the name Thanksgiving for Holy Communion.

==History==

The institution of Corpus Christi as a feast in the Christian calendar resulted from approximately forty years of work on the part of Juliana of Liège, a 13th-century Norbertine canoness, also known as Juliana de Cornillon, born in 1191 or 1192 in Liège, Belgium, a city where there were groups of women dedicated to Eucharistic worship. Guided by exemplary priests, they lived together, devoted to prayer and to charitable works. Orphaned at the age of five, she and her sister Agnes were entrusted to the care of the Augustinian nuns at the convent and leprosarium of Mont-Cornillon, where Juliana developed a special veneration for the Blessed Sacrament.

She always longed for a feast day outside of Lent in its honour. Her vita reports that this desire was enhanced by a vision of the church under the appearance of the full moon having one dark spot, which signified the absence of such a solemnity. In 1208, she reported her first vision of Christ in which she was instructed to plead for the institution of the feast of Corpus Christi. The vision was repeated for the next 20 years but she kept it a secret. When she eventually relayed it to her confessor, he relayed it to the bishop.

Juliana also petitioned the learned Dominican Hugh of St-Cher, and Robert de Thorete, Bishop of Liège. At that time bishops could order feasts in their dioceses, so Bishop Robert ordered in 1246 a celebration of Corpus Christi to be held in the diocese each year thereafter on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. The first such celebration occurred at St Martin&#x27;s Church in the city that same year.

Hugh of St-Cher travelled to Liège as Cardinal-Legate in 1251 and, finding that the feast was not being observed, reinstated it. In the following year, he established the feast for his whole jurisdiction (Germany, Dacia, Bohemia, and Moravia), to be celebrated on the Thursday after the Octave of Trinity (one week later than had been indicated for Liège), but with a certain elasticity, for he granted an indulgence for all who confessed their sins and attended church &quot;on a date and in a place where [the feast] was celebrated&quot;.

Jacques Pantaléon of Troyes was also won over to the cause of the Feast of Corpus Christi during his ministry as Archdeacon in Liège under the diocesan bishop Robert of Thourotte. It was he who, having become Pope as Urban IV in 1264, instituted the Solemnity of Corpus Christi on the Thursday after Pentecost as a feast for the entire Latin Church, by the papal bull &quot;Transiturus de hoc mundo&quot;. The legend that this act was inspired by a procession to Orvieto in 1263, after a priest Peter of Prague and his congregation witnessed a Eucharistic miracle of a bleeding consecrated host at Bolsena, has been called into question by scholars who note problems in the dating of the miracle, whose tradition begins in the 14th century, and the interests of Urban IV, a former Archdeacon in Liège.

Though this was the first papally imposed universal feast for the Latin Church, it was not widely celebrated for half a century. It was adopted by a number of dioceses in Germany and by the Cistercians, and in 1295 was celebrated in Venice. It became a truly universal feast only after the bull of Urban IV was included in the collection of laws known as the Clementines, compiled under Pope Clement V, but promulgated only by his successor Pope John XXII in 1317.

While the institution of the Eucharist is celebrated on Holy (Maundy) Thursday, the liturgy on that day also commemorates Christ&#x27;s washing of the disciples&#x27; feet, the institution of the priesthood and the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane. So many other functions took place on this day that the principal event was almost lost sight of. This is mentioned in the Bull &quot;Transiturus&quot; as the chief reason for the introduction of the new feast. Hence, the feast of Corpus Christi was established to create a feast focused solely on the Holy Eucharist.

Three versions of the office for the feast of Corpus Christi in extant manuscripts provide evidence for the Liège origins and voice of Juliana in an original office, which was followed by two later versions of the office. A highly sophisticated and polished version can be found in BNF 1143, a musical manuscript devoted entirely to the feast, upon which there is wide scholarly agreement: the version in BNF 1143 is a revision of an earlier version found in Prague, Abbey of Strahov MS D.E.I. 7, and represents the work of Thomas Aquinas following or during his residency at Orvieto from 1259 to 1265. The office can also be found in the 1343 codex &quot;Regimen Animarum&quot;. This liturgy may be used as a votive Mass of the Blessed Sacrament on weekdays in ordinary time. The hymn Aquinas composed for Vespers of Corpus Christi, &quot;Pange Lingua&quot; or another eucharistic hymn, is also used on Maundy Thursday during the procession of the Blessed Sacrament to the altar of repose.

The last two verses of &quot;Pange Lingua&quot; are also used as a separate hymn, &quot;Tantum Ergo&quot;, which is sung at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. &quot;O Salutaris Hostia&quot;, another hymn sung at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, comprises the last two verses of &quot;Verbum Supernum Prodiens&quot;, Aquinas&#x27; hymn for Lauds of Corpus Christi. Aquinas also composed the propers for the Mass of Corpus Christi, including the sequence &quot;Lauda Sion Salvatorem&quot;. The epistle reading for the Mass was taken from Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians (), and the Gospel reading was taken from the Gospel of John ().
When Pope Pius V revised the General Roman Calendar (see Tridentine calendar), Corpus Christi was one of only two &quot;feasts of devotion&quot; that he kept, the other being Trinity Sunday. In that calendar, Corpus Christi was celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. The feast had an octave until 1955, when Pope Pius XII suppressed all octaves, even in local calendars, except those of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII).

From 1849 until 1969, a separate Feast of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ was assigned originally to the first Sunday in July, later to the first day of the month. This feast was removed from the General Roman Calendar in 1969, &quot;because the Most Precious Blood of Christ the Redeemer is already venerated in the solemnities of the Passion, of Corpus Christi and of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and in the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. But the Mass of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ is placed among the votive Masses&quot;.

==Celebration==
===Western Christianity===
====Roman Catholic Church====

The feast of Corpus Christi is one of five occasions in the year on which a diocesan bishop is not to be away from his diocese unless for a grave and urgent reason.

In many countries, the day is a holy day of obligation to participate in the celebration of Mass and takes place on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. On that day or on the following Sunday, which is the feast day where it is not a holy day of obligation, it is traditional to hold in the streets of a town or in an individual parish a procession with prayers and singing to honor the Blessed Sacrament. During the procession, the consecrated host is displayed in a monstrance held aloft by a member of the clergy. At the end of the procession, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament is imparted.
A notable procession in the Philippines is that of the Archdiocese of Manila. The archbishop celebrates a mid-afternoon Mass at the Shrine of the Blessed Sacrament in Santa Cruz before presiding over a procession to the Manila Cathedral.

====Lutheranism====
Martin Luther spoke out against processing with the consecrated elements, which he viewed as &quot;only play-acting&quot; and &quot;just vain idolatry&quot;. In one of his &quot;postils&quot; (homilies), he wrote

Many personal opinions of Martin Luther were not adopted by the Lutheran Churches, however, and because Lutheranism retained much of the pre-Reformation liturgical and devotional practices, the Lutheran Reformation is generally considered to be the most conservative among the Protestant traditions. The Feast of Corpus Christi was retained in the calendars of the Lutheran Church until about 1600. Lutherans were recorded to have prominent celebrations of the Feast of Corpus Christi in Dessau (1532), Brandenburg (1540), and Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach (1548). The Feast of Corpus Christi continues to be celebrated in certain Lutheran churches, particularly those of Evangelical Catholic churchmanship.

====Anglicanism====
The celebration of Corpus Christi was abolished in England in 1548. However, in the Church of England since the 2000 edition of &quot;Common Worship,&quot; &quot;the Thursday after Trinity Sunday may be observed as The Day of Thanksgiving for the Institution of Holy Communion (Corpus Christi)&quot; as one of the church&#x27;s Festivals and with a special liturgy.

The feast is also celebrated by Anglican parishes of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, even in provinces of the Anglican Communion that do not officially include it in their calendars. &quot;McCausland&#x27;s Order of Divine Service&quot;, the most commonly used ordo in the Anglican Church of Canada, provides lections for the day.

====Old Catholicism and Western-Rite Orthodoxy====
Corpus Christi is also celebrated by the Old Catholic Church, the Liberal Catholic Church and by some Western Rite Orthodox Christians.

====Reformed====
Followers of the Reformed tradition (including the Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist denominations) do not observe the feast.

=== Eastern Christianity ===
==== Byzantine rite: Italo-Greek and Ukrainian traditions ====
Eucharistic devotion in Byzantine rite before introduction of the feast of Holy Eucharist was primarily expressed in the offices of preparation to Holy communion, that borrow their structure from the liturgical hour of Orthos (appropriate psalms followed by a Canon and a sequence of prayers). In the most developed form, practiced in old believer communities, the preparation for Communion includes also three minor hours adapted for the occasion.

As both the devotion to the Eucharist and the texts that can be put to liturgical use existed by that time, the Byzantine rite Christians of South Italy who were in communion with the Pope at time of &quot;Transitus de hoc mundo&quot;, were quick to arrange them into a new feast that was set on the same date as in the Latin rite. From the beginning of the 14th century, manuscripts of Grottaferrata liturgical books include the feast of &quot;Holy and Immaculate Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, with liturgical texts taken from either preparation to Communion prayers, or the preexisting feasts, e.g. Holy Thursday. Over the following centuries, new texts were added to them.

After the Union of Brest, Ruthenian Greek Catholics gained access to educational institutions in Rome, and became familiar with Italo-Byzantine feast of the Holy and Immaculate Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. This liturgical tradition became the foundation of adopting this feast in Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, having the Italo-Greek texts as its core, and adding some new proper compositions. In fact, before the standardization of the texts of the feast around the time of the Synod of Zamoisk, it existed in existed several versions, that shows its &quot;bottom-to-top&quot; origins, as opposed to the idea of it being introduced forcefully by a Latin-minded central authority. The only properly Latin elements of the celebration were the Synaxarion that is adapted from a homily of Thomas Aquinas and the procession with the Holy Gifts. In the current use of UGCC, both of these elements are excluded.

===Folk traditions===

On the eve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, clergy bless Corpus Christi wreaths that are made of flowers. Corpus Christi wreaths and bouquets are often &quot;attached to flags and banners, to houses, and to the arches of green boughs that span the streets.&quot; In Christian homes, these Corpus Christi wreaths are suspended on walls or displayed on doors and in windows. Corpus Christi wreaths are also &quot;put up in gardens, fields, and pastures, with a prayer for protection and blessing upon the growing harvest.&quot;

Throughout Christendom, &quot;the custom developed of carrying the Blessed Sacrament in a splendid procession through the town after the Mass on Corpus Christi Day.&quot; The monstrance which holds the host is surrounded by a Corpus Christi wreath of flowers. During the procession, church bells are rung and &quot;the faithful kneel in front of their homes to adore the Eucharistic Lord.&quot; Along the route in which the procession occurs, Christian homes &quot;are decorated with little birch trees and green boughs&quot;, with candles being lit in the windows. Oftentimes, stops are made at various points called &quot;stations&quot; during the procession and &quot;the Blessed Sacrament is put on an altar table&quot; while a Gospel passage is read and hymns are sung, along with prayer being made.

====Austria====
Corpus Christi is not only a high festival of the Catholic church year in Austria, but also a public holiday. This is always celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity, which means it can take place between May 21 and June 24.

====Brazil and Portugal====
Street carpets for the Feast of Corpus Christi () are made of different materials such as coffee grounds, flowers, sand, and salt.

====Croatia====
In Croatian language, there are various names for the Feast: &quot;Brašančevo&quot; (after hypocorism &quot;brašance&quot; of the noun &quot;brašno&quot;, meaning &quot;flour&quot;; dating from 18th century and used in Požega area, Otok, Varoš, Sikirevci and southern Baranja, Luč, as well among Croats of Vojvodina and Herzegovina) with variations (&quot;Brošančevo&quot;, &quot;Brešančevo&quot;), &quot;Korosante&quot; (from Latin &quot;Corpo Sancto&quot;; used in Dubrovnik area and Pelješac), &quot;Božji dan&quot; (&quot;Božji don&quot;; literally &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day&quot;) and &quot;Božji blagdan&quot; (lit. &quot;Lord&#x27;s/God&#x27;s Feast&quot;).

Feast (officially known as &quot;Tijelovo&quot;) is a national holiday and non-working day in Croatia since 2001. Around churches and in the city centers processions are held, headed with priests carrying Blessed Altair Sacrament. They are usually followed by four men carrying a canopy above the Sacrament and children in white who throw flower petals (usually rose) along the way.

====England====
In medieval times in many parts of Europe, Corpus Christi was a time for the performance of mystery plays. The plays in York, England, were performed on Corpus Christi Day for some 200 years until their suppression in the sixteenth century during the Protestant Reformation.

====Peru====
In the southern highlands of the Cusco Region of Peru, the festival of Quyllurit&#x27;i is held near Corpus Christi in the Sinaqara Valley. As many as 10,000 pilgrims come from neighboring areas. Culminating on Trinity Sunday, this festival marks the return in the sky of the Pleiades constellation, known in the Quechua language as &quot;Qullqa&quot;, or &quot;storehouse&quot;, as it is associated with the upcoming harvest and New Year. The festival precedes the official feast of Corpus Christi, held the Thursday following Trinity Sunday, but it is closely associated with it.
The official feast on Thursday is a baroque display of religious syncretism between Catholicism and Incan traditions. Ten days before the main event, the Virgin of Bethlehem and Saint Joseph are taken in procession to the Church of Santa Clara. On the main day, the Eucharist is celebrated with a special mass and a procession around the main square, followed by a procession of saint images, including Saint Jerome, Saint Sebastian, Saint Anne, Saint Barbara, Saint James, Saint Blaise, Saint Anthony the Abbot, Saint Christopher, the Virgin of Remedies, the Virgin of the Nativity, the Purified Virgin, the Virgin of Bethlehem, and the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception.

The saints remain in the Cusco Cathedral for eight days, where they are believed to &quot;debate&quot; the city&#x27;s future and the behavior of the faithful. Afterward, they have a farewell procession around the Plaza de Armas and return to their respective temples over the following week. The festival also features the consumption of &quot;&quot;chiriuchu&quot;,&quot; a traditional dish.

====Poland====

In Spycimierz in central Poland (Gmina Uniejów), parishioners arrange a carpet of live flowers about one kilometre long. A solemn procession passes over it at 5 pm. Long carpets of flowers are also laid in four parishes in the Opole Voivodeship in southern Poland. Flower carpets tradition for Corpus Christi processions was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2021.

====Spain====
In Spain, Corpus Christi is celebrated in all dioceses. It has special relevance in Castilla-La Mancha, a community that marks this date as a holiday.

=====Andalucia=====
The celebrations in Seville are depicted in a section of &quot;Iberia&quot;, the masterpiece of the composer Albéniz.

=====Castile-La Mancha=====
Corpus Christi is one of the main festivals in Toledo, Spain.

=====Castile and León=====
In the village of Castrillo de Murcia near Burgos, the celebration includes the practice of El Colacho (baby jumping).

=====Catalonia=====
In Catalonia, Corpus Christi is celebrated with the tradition of the dancing egg. There is evidence this tradition dates from the 16th century.

The &quot;Patum de Berga&quot; is a popular and traditional festival that is celebrated each year in the Catalan city of Berga (Barcelona) during Corpus Christi. It consists of a series of &quot;dances&quot; (&quot;balls&quot;) by townspeople dressed as mystical and symbolical figures. The &quot;balls&quot; are marked by their solemnity and their ample use of fire and pyrotechnics. It was declared a &quot;Traditional Festival of National Interest&quot; by the Generalitat de Catalunya in 1983, and as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2005.

== Date ==
Corpus Christi is a moveable feast, celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday, 60 days after Easter, or, in countries where it is not a holy day of obligation, on the following Sunday.

The earliest possible Thursday celebration falls on May 21 (as in 1818 and 2285), the latest on June 24 (as in 1943 and 2038). The Sunday celebration of the feast, introduced in the second half of the 20th century, occurs three days later, between May 24 at earliest (for the first time in 2285) and June 27 at latest (for the first time in 2038). For Western Rite Orthodox Christians, since they use the Julian calendar, at least for all Feast Days dependent on the date of Pascha, their date of the celebration of Corpus Christi, translates to, in the Gregorian calendar, from June 3 at the earliest, to July 7, at the latest.

Corpus Christi is a public holiday in some countries with a predominantly Catholic population including, among others, Argentina, Austria, Bolivia, parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, parts of Germany, Grenada, Haiti, Jerusalem in Israel, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Saint Lucia, San Marino, Spain, parts of Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, parts of the United States (including parts of Puerto Rico), and Venezuela.

<text>Rostov-on-Don is a port city and the administrative centre of Rostov Oblast and the Southern Federal District of Russia. It lies in the southeastern part of the East European Plain on the Don River, from the Sea of Azov, directly north of the North Caucasus. The southwestern suburbs of the city lie above the Don river delta. Rostov-on-Don has a population of over one million people and is an important cultural, educational, economic and logistical centre of Southern Russia.

==History==
===Early history===
From ancient times, the area around the mouth of the Don River has held cultural and commercial importance. Ancient indigenous inhabitants included the Scythian and Sarmatian tribes. It was the site of Tanais, an ancient Greek colony, Fort Tana under the Genoese, and Fort Azak in the time of the Ottoman Empire.

In 1749, a custom house was established on the Temernik River, a tributary of the Don, by edict of the Empress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, in order to control trade with Turkey. It was co-located with a fortress named for Dimitry of Rostov, a metropolitan bishop of the old northern town of Rostov the Great. Azov, a town closer to the Sea of Azov on the Don, gradually lost its commercial importance in the region to the new fortress, but it remains an important historical center.

In 1756, the &quot;Russian commercial and trading company of Constantinople&quot; was founded at the &quot;merchants&#x27; settlement&quot; (Kupecheskaya Sloboda) on the high bank of the Don. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, with the incorporation of previously Ottoman Black Sea territories into the Russian Empire, the settlement lost much of its militarily strategic importance as a frontier post.

In 1796, the settlement was chartered and in 1797, it became the seat of Rostovsky Uyezd within Novorossiysk Governorate. In 1806, it was officially renamed Rostov-on-Don. During the 19th century, due to its river connections with Russia&#x27;s interior, Rostov developed into a major trade centre and communications hub. A railway connection with Kharkiv was completed in 1870, with further links following in 1871 to Voronezh and in 1875 to Vladikavkaz.

Concurrent with improvements in communications, heavy industry developed. Coal from the Donets Basin and iron ore from Krivoy Rog supported the establishment of an iron foundry in 1846. In 1859, the production of pumps and steam boilers began. Industrial growth was accompanied by a rapid increase in population, with 119,500 residents registered in Rostov by the end of the nineteenth century along with approximately 140 industrial businesses. The harbour was one of the largest trade hubs in southern Russia, especially for the export of wheat, timber, and iron ore.

In 1779, Rostov-on-Don became associated with a settlement of Armenian refugees from Crimea at Nakhichevan-on-Don. The two settlements were separated by a field of wheat. In 1928, the two towns were merged. The former town border lies beneath the Teatralnaya Square of central Rostov-on-Don. By 1928, following the incorporation of the hitherto neighbouring city of Nakhichevan-on-Don, Rostov had become the third-largest city in Russia.

In the early 20th century, epidemics of cholera during the summer months were not uncommon.

===20th century===
During World War I Rostov-on-Don was briefly occupied by the German Empire in 1918.

During the Russian Civil War, the Whites and the Reds contested Rostov-on-Don, then the most heavily industrialized city of South Russia. By 1928, the regional government had moved from the old Cossack capital of Novocherkassk to Rostov-on-Don.

In the Soviet years, the Bolsheviks demolished two of Rostov-on-Don&#x27;s principal landmarks: St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral (1908) and St. George Cathedral (1783–1807).

During World War II, Nazi German forces occupied Rostov-on-Don, at first from 19/20 November to 2 December 1941, after attacks by the German First Panzer Army in the Battle of Rostov, and then for seven months from 24 July 1942 to 14 February 1943. The town was of strategic importance as a railway junction and a river port accessing the Caucasus, a region rich in oil and minerals. It took ten years to restore the city from the damage during World War II.

In 1942 up to 30,000 Russian Jews were massacred by the German military in Rostov-on-Don at a site called Zmievskaya Balka.

=== 21st century ===
On 19 March 2016, Flydubai Flight 981, a Boeing 737-800 operating from Dubai to Rostov-on-Don in Russia, crashed during a go-around in inclement weather at Rostov-on-Don Airport, killing all 62 people (55 passengers and 7 crew) on board.

Rostov-on-Don hosted several matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Rostov-on-Don is the location of the Russian Southern Military District, which includes the 58th Combined Arms Army. As such, it was a key logistical hub during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive.

On 23 June 2023, amid the war, the Wagner Group, a private military company fighting on behalf of the Russian Federation, declared a rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defence and took control of Rostov-on-Don. On June 24, after reaching a negotiated settlement with the Russian government and military, the Wagner Group withdrew from the city.

=== Climate ===
Albert Parry, born in 1901 in Rostov-on-Don, wrote of the summers of his childhood:
:There were sultry days of brassy sun, but also cool evenings on the balconies facing the Don River, with the soft glow of charcoal in the samovar, with the ripe cherries crushed by your spoon against the bottom and sides of your glass of scalding tea.

Rostov-on-Don lies in a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;). The winter is moderately cold, with an average January temperature of . The lowest recorded temperature of occurred in January 1940.

==Symbols==
In December 1996, Rostov-on-Don adopted a coat of arms, a flag and a mayoral decoration as the symbols of the town. The first coat of arms of Rostov-on-Don was designed in 1811 and approved by the Tsar. In 1904, some changes were made. One lasting oil painting of the coat-of-arms is kept in the regional local history museum but its accuracy and authenticity are uncertain. In June 1996, the Rostov-on-Don City Duma adopted a variant of the coat-of-arms in which a tower represents the St. Dimitry Rostovsky Fortress. The ancient Russian arms reference the role Rostov played in the defense of Russia&#x27;s borders. The coat-of-arms adorns the mayor&#x27;s decoration but all other cases of its use are first considered for approval by the City Duma.

===Flag===
The flag of Rostov-on-Don was approved by the Duma on September 20, 1864. At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries the home guard regiments, which defended the Southern borders of Russia, were raised under this flag. The &quot;Flag of Rostov&quot; is kept in the town&#x27;s municipal building under glass. Its length is and width, . The flag is taken out of the building only on Victory Day and Rostov-on-Don Day by a guard of honour.

In 1870, an oval-shaped mayoral decoration wrought from precious or semi-precious white metal was introduced. On the front is written &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; at the top, the Rostov-on-Don coat-of-arms is in the center and the inscription, &quot;Mayor of the City&quot; is written at the bottom. On its reverse side, the day of its adoption, April 9, 1996, is recorded. The decoration is worn over the suit on a large chain. The mayor returns the decoration to the Duma on his or her retirement from office.

The Emblem of the Don Host Oblast was introduced in July 5 (18), 1878. The flag of the All Great Don Army was introduced in May 1918 on the &quot;Circle of the Don Saving&quot;.

<text>The canton of Glarus ( ; ; ; ) is a canton in east-central Switzerland. The capital is Glarus.
The population speaks a variety of Alemannic German.
The majority of the population (81%) identifies as Christian, about evenly split between Protestants and Catholics.

== History ==
According to legend, the inhabitants of the Linth Valley were converted to Christianity in the 6th century by the Irish monk Saint Fridolin, the founder of Säckingen Abbey in what is now the German state of Baden-Württemberg. From the 9th century, the area around Glarus was owned by Säckingen Abbey, the town of Glarus being recorded as &quot;Clarona&quot;. The Alemanni began to settle in the valley in the early 8th century. The Alemannic German language took hold only gradually and was dominant by the 11th century. By 1288, the Habsburgs had claimed all the abbey&#x27;s rights.

Glarus joined the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1352 as one of the foundational eight cantons (&quot;Acht Orte&quot;) of the period of 1353–1481. The first recorded Landsgemeinde of Glarus took place in 1387. Habsburg&#x27;s attempts to reconquer the valley were repelled in the Battle of Näfels of 1388. A banner depicting Saint Fridolin was used to rally the people of Glarus at that battle, and from that time, Glarus has used the image of Saint Fridolin on its flags and in its coat of arms.

The County of Werdenberg was annexed to Glarus in 1517.
Between 1506 and 1516, the later reformer Huldrych Zwingli was a priest in Glarus, but Glarus remained Catholic, and by 1564, all of Zwingli&#x27;s followers were eliminated. This, however, did not end the struggles between the Protestants and the Catholics in the area. To secure peace it was decided that each party should have its own assembly (&quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;) in 1623, and at a later stage in 1683, each side was granted the right to have its own tribunals.

Between 1798 and 1803, Glarus was part of the canton of Linth as established by Napoleon. In 1836 the constitution was adapted to unite the assemblies and establish a single &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot;.

In the early 1840s, after several years of failed crops and as food became scarce, much of the canton found itself deep in poverty. With more workers than available jobs, emigration to the United States of America was seen as a solution. The Glarus Emigration Society was established in 1844, which offered loans to help residents purchase land in the New World. Many of the resulting emigrants went to the state of Wisconsin, where they founded the town of New Glarus.

On May 6, 2007, Glarus became the first Swiss canton to lower the voting age to 16.

== Geography ==
The canton of Glarus is dominated by the deep valley of the Linth River and the smaller Sernftal on the east. Most of the area is mountainous. The highest peak in the Glarus Alps is the Tödi at Other mountains include the Hausstock () and the Glärnisch (). The canton contains part of a thrust fault that was declared a geologic UNESCO World Heritage Site, under the name Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona, in 2008. Famous outcrops in the Swiss Tectonic Arena Sardona include those at Lochsite near Glarus and in a mountain cliff called &quot;Tschingelhörner&quot; between Elm and Flims (in the same cliff is a natural hole called the Martinsloch). There is also a large lake called Walensee (Lake Walen) on the north. The total area of the canton of Glarus is , of which about half is considered productive. Forestry is an important branch of industry in the canton.

== Municipalities ==

The &quot;Landsgemeinde&quot; (cantonal assembly) of 2006 decided that the 25 municipalities of Glarus be consolidated to three, effective 1 January 2011.

* The new municipality of Glarus subsumed the former municipalities of Glarus, Ennenda, Netstal and Riedern.
* Glarus Nord subsumed Bilten, Filzbach, Mollis, Mühlehorn, Näfels, Niederurnen, Oberurnen and Obstalden.
* Glarus Süd subsumed Betschwanden, Braunwald, Elm, Engi, Haslen (including Leuggelbach and Nidfurn), Linthal, Luchsingen (including Diesbach and Hätzingen), Matt, Mitlödi, Rüti, Schwanden, Schwändi and Sool.

== Economy ==

The canton&#x27;s geography helped establish slate works in the 17th century. The mountainous surroundings of Glarus also served as an advantage in industrialisation. Cotton spinning was important in the 18th century, complementing traditional woollen spinning. Industrialisation also brought cotton printing, hydroelectric plants, metal and machinery factories, and paper mills.

In 2014, about 5% of the workers in Glarus worked in the primary sector (the total for all of Switzerland is 3.3%). Of these 5%, in 2008, nearly three-quarters were involved in dairy farming and cattle breeding. In 2014 the secondary sector employed 8,322 or about 38.2% of the total, which is much higher than 21.8% for the entire country. Over one-quarter of those in the secondary sector worked in the construction industry. The tertiary sector employed 12,366, or about 56.8% of the total, almost 18% lower than 74.9% nationwide. Of those in the tertiary sector, 11.72% work in retail shops and 10.37% are in health care.

<text>Colonel Edward Sexby (or Saxby; 1616 – 13 January 1658) was an English Puritan soldier and Leveller in the army of Oliver Cromwell. Later he turned against Cromwell and plotted his assassination, which Sexby considered tyrannicide, as a decapitation strike, which would then be followed by a joint regime change uprising by both Cavaliers and Levellers. Failing in his efforts, Sexby was taken prisoner and died in the Tower of London.

==Biography==
Sexby was born in Suffolk in 1616, but little else is known about his life before the English Civil War. Reportedly he was a son of a gentleman, had been apprenticed as a grocer in London, and may have had family connections to Cromwell. In 1643 he was a trooper in Cromwell&#x27;s Roundhead cavalry regiment (nicknamed the Ironsides).

In 1647, being still a private in the same regiment, which was then commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, he took a leading part in the movement against disbanding the army, and was one of the three soldiers charged with the letter from the army to their generals which Skippon brought before the House of Commons on 30 April 1647. He became one of the leaders of the &quot;Agitators&quot;, and acted as their chief spokesman in the Putney Debates of the Army Council in October 1647. In the debates, he drew a distinction between property ownership and political liberty: We have engaged in this kingdom and ventured our lives, and it was all for this: to recover our birthrights and privileges as Englishmen; and by the arguments urged there is none. There are many thousands of us soldiers that have ventured our lives; we have had little propriety in the kingdom as to our estates, yet we have had a birthright. But it seems now, except a man hath a fixed estate in this kingdom, he hath no right in this kingdom. I wonder we were so much deceived ... I shall tell you in a word my resolution. I am resolved to give my birthright to none. His contributions irritated Cromwell, who complained: &quot;I confess I was most dissatisfied with that I heard Mr Sexby speak, of any man here, because it did savor so much of will.&quot; His speeches were vigorous and effective, opposing all compromise with King Charles I and demanding the immediate establishment of manhood suffrage. He may have been involved in the capture of the king at Holdenby House in 1647.

Sexby appears to have left the army about the close of 1647, but happening to be present at the Battle of Preston, with a letter from the Levellers leader John Lilburne to Cromwell, he was entrusted with a despatch from Cromwell to the speaker of the House of Commons announcing his victory. The House of Commons voted him £100 as a reward. In February 1649 Parliament entrusted him with the duty of arresting the Scottish commissioners, for which he was ordered £20. He was also appointed governor of Portland, is henceforth described as Captain Sexby, and was more than once charged with commissions requiring courage and dexterity.

In June 1650, at Cromwell&#x27;s suggestion, Sexby was charged to raise a foot regiment for service in Ireland, but when completed it was ordered to Scotland. Sexby, who held the rank first of lieutenant-colonel and then of colonel, took part with his regiment in the siege of Tantallon Castle in February 1651. In June 1651 he was tried by court-martial for detaining the pay of his soldiers, and lost his commission.

A few months later Cromwell and the intelligence committee of the Council of State sent Sexby on a mission to France. He was charged to give an account of the political condition and the temper of the people. He negotiated with the Prince de Conti and the Frondeurs of Guienne, to whom he proposed an adaptation of the &quot;Agreement of the People&quot; as the basis of a republican constitution for France, and with the Huguenots of Languedoc. One of his emissaries was captured, and (according to Edmund Ludlow), Sexby had a narrow escape himself. Sexby returned to England about August 1653, and on 23 August 1654 was ordered £1,000 for his expenses during his mission.

Sexby was eager for an Anglo-Spanish league against France, and hoped to obtain the command of the levies which it was proposed to send to the support of the Frondeurs. Cromwell&#x27;s abandonment of the projects against France, and still more his assumption of The Protectorate, caused a breach with Sexby, who allied himself with other disaffected republicans, disseminated &quot;Samizdat&quot; pamphlets denouncing the Protector, and took a leading part in the planning for a regime change uprising of both royalists and levellers in the spring of 1655. In February 1655 Cromwell&#x27;s officers in the west of England were in hot pursuit of Sexby, but he succeeded in escaping to Flanders. At Antwerp he made the acquaintance of Colonel Robert Phelips and other royalists, to whom he described Cromwell as a false, perjured rogue, and affirmed that, if proper security for popular liberties were given, he would be content to see Charles II and the House of Stuart restored.

Sexby also sought an interview with Count Fuensaldaña, second in command of the Spanish Royal Army in the Spanish Netherlands, to whom he revealed all he knew of Cromwell&#x27;s foreign plans and of the expedition to the West Indies, and from whom he asked a supply of money and the assistance of some of the Irish troops in the Spanish service to raise an insurrection in England. Fuensaldanha sent Sexby to Spain that his proposals might be considered by the Spanish council (June 1655), and he returned again about December with supplies of money and conditional promises of support. Father Peter Talbot, who acted as interpreter in Sexby&#x27;s dealings with Fuensaldanha, communicated his proposals to Charles II, urging the King to come to an agreement with Spain, and to use Sexby and his party. In December 1656 Sexby presented a paper of proposals to Don John of Austria, offering to raise a regime change uprising in England, and requesting a thousand Irish foot and four hundred horses (for which he undertook to provide troopers). The royalists were to assist, but he stipulated &quot;that no mention be made of the king before such time Cromwell be destroyed, and till then the royalists that shall take arms shall speak of nothing but the liberty of the country, according to the declaration whereof I have spoken with the King of England&#x27;s ministers&quot;.

The Protector&#x27;s government through its agents abroad was kept well informed of Sexby&#x27;s negotiations with Spain, and a number of his intercepted letters, written under the assumed names of &quot;Brookes&quot; and &quot;Hungerford&quot;, were in its hands. In Cromwell&#x27;s speech at the opening of the Second Protectorate Parliament (17 September 1656), he informed them of Sexby&#x27;s plot, terming him &quot;a wretched creature, an apostate from religion and all honesty&quot;. The assassination of Cromwell was an essential preliminary to the success of the rising. Sexby sent over &quot;strange engines&quot; for the purpose, but his agents missed their opportunities, and in January 1657 an attempt to fire the Palace of Whitehall led to the arrest of their leader, Miles Sindercombe. Still confident, Sexby devised new plots. &quot;Be not discouraged&quot;, he wrote to Father Talbot, &quot;for so long as Sexby lives there is no danger but Cromwell shall have his hands full, and I hope his heart ere long, for I have more irons in the fire for Cromwell than one. … Either I or Cromwell must perish&quot;.
A few months after the arrest of Sindercombe, an apology for tyrannicide, entitled &quot;Killing No Murder&quot;—which was dedicated to Cromwell—arrived in England from Holland. It was published by Sexby, probably with the assistance of Silius Titus, under the name of a former Army agitator called William Allen. In June he followed the pamphlet to England, to concert measures for carrying out its principles, and on 24 July, just as he was embarking for Flanders again, he was arrested &quot;in a mean habit disguised as a countryman&quot;. He died in the Tower on 13 January 1658, &quot;having been a while distracted in his mind and long sick&quot;. His body was buried in the cemetery near the Tower chapel two days later.

&quot;Killing No Murder&quot; was answered by Michael Hawke of the Middle Temple in &quot;Killing is Murder, and no Murder: or An exercitation concerning a scurrilous pamphlet, of one William Allen, a Jesuitical impostor, intituled Killing No Murder&quot;, London, Printed for the author, 1657. Sexby&#x27;s authorship of the former is proved by internal evidence, and by his own confession made in the Tower. Captain Silius Titus, who was intimate with Sexby and may perhaps have assisted him in writing it, repudiated him after the Restoration.

==Family==
His wife visited him during his imprisonment in the Tower, but no other information about her has been found.

==Fictional portrayals==
A character based on Sexby was portrayed by John Simm in the 2008 television drama &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Whore&quot;, with several significant changes to the facts of his biography.

Sexby appears in the novel Rebels and Traitors by Lindsey Davis.

Sexby also appears as a character in the 1976 play by Caryl Churchill, &quot;Light Shining in Buckinghamshire&quot;, as a participant in the Putney Debates.

<text>Miles Sindercombe (died 13 February 1657) was the leader of a group that tried to assassinate Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell during the period of the Protectorate in 1657.

==Early military career==
Sindercombe was born in Kent and was apprenticed to a surgeon. During the English Civil War, he became a Roundhead and a Leveller. In 1649, he took part in the mutiny of his regiment and when it failed he fled. In 1655, he re-appeared as a member of a cavalry regiment in Scotland and took part in a plot to take control of the local army. This failed as well, and Sindercombe fled to the Netherlands.

==Plotters==
In Flanders, he met another Leveller and anti-Cromwell plotter, Edward Sexby, in 1656. Sindercombe joined his plot to assassinate Cromwell in hope of restoring the Puritan republic as they saw it. Sexby supplied Sindercombe with money and weapons.

In 1656, Sindercombe returned to England and gathered a group of co-conspirators, including renegade soldier John Cecil, apparent conman William Boyes and John Toope, a member of Cromwell&#x27;s s. Toope gave the other plotters information about Cromwell&#x27;s movements.

==Assassination attempts==
First, Sindercombe rented a house in King Street in Westminster, where they intended to shoot Cromwell when he rode past in his coach. However, they noticed that it would be a difficult place to escape from after the attempt, so they abandoned the plan.

Next, Sindercombe rented another house near Westminster Abbey, using the name &quot;John Fish&quot;. He intended to shoot Cromwell with an arquebus on his way from Westminster Abbey to Parliament on 17 September 1656. However, when a large crowd gathered outside, Boyes panicked and left, and the attempt had to be abandoned.

Sindercombe&#x27;s group then intended to shoot Cromwell when he left for Hampton Court, as he customarily did every Friday. They intended to shoot at Cromwell&#x27;s coach while it was going through a narrow passage. As it happened, Cromwell changed his mind on that particular Friday, and the plotters waited in vain.

The next idea was to shoot Cromwell when he was walking in Hyde Park. They broke the hinges of the park gates to facilitate their escape, and John Cecil began to follow Cromwell and his entourage. However, Cromwell became interested in Cecil&#x27;s horse and called him over. Cecil lost his nerve and could not shoot him. He afterwards claimed that the horse was ill and that he could not have escaped.

==Capture==
After so many failed attempts, Cromwell&#x27;s spymaster, John Thurloe, had noticed the would-be assassins. He had already heard about the plot from his spies on the Continent.

Sindercombe&#x27;s next idea was to burn down Whitehall Palace and the Lord Protector with it. Boyes made an explosive device out of gunpowder, tar and pitch, and the group planted it in the palace chapel on 8 January 1657. However, Toope, who had had a change of heart, revealed the plan to authorities. When the plotters left, guards disarmed the bomb.

Thurloe gave an order to arrest the plotters. Cecil was easily captured, but Boyes escaped. Sindercombe fought the guards until one guard cut off part of his nose. Cecil and Sindercombe were sent to the Tower.

Cecil decided to tell all. With Toope&#x27;s aid, Thurloe learned Sexby&#x27;s part in the plot and presented his findings to the Parliament.

==Trial and death==
Sindercombe remained uncooperative. On 9 February 1657, he was found guilty of High treason when both Cecil and Toope testified against him and was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. Sindercomb&#x27;s sister brought him poison the night before he was to be executed, either to spare him the agony of such a death, or because he did not want to face the humiliation of execution. He drank it and was found dead in his cell in the Tower of London on 13 February 1657. His body was dragged to the erected gallows and buried beneath it by the hangman.(He was actually gibbeted on Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green.)

<text>John Thurloe (June 1616 – 21 February 1668) was an English politician who served as secretary to the council of state in Protectorate England and spymaster for Oliver Cromwell and held the position of Postmaster General between 1655 and 1660. He was from Great Milton in Oxfordshire and of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

==Origins==
Thurloe was born in Essex in 1616 and was baptised on 12 June. His father was Rev. Thomas Thurloe, Rector of Abbess Roding.

==Career==
He trained as a lawyer in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was first in the service of Oliver St John, solicitor–general to King Charles I and Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. In January 1645, he became a secretary to the parliamentary commissioners at the Treaty of Uxbridge. In 1647, Thurloe was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a member. He remained on the sidelines during the English Civil War but after the accession of Oliver Cromwell, became part of his government. In March 1651, Thurloe accompanied Oliver St John as his secretary on his embassy to the United Provinces to propose a union between the Commonwealth and the Dutch. In 1652, he was named a secretary for state.

In 1653, he became head of intelligence and developed a widespread network of spies in England and on the continent. These included Henry Manning, the Dutch diplomat and historian Lieuwe van Aitzema, the mathematician John Wallis, who established a code-breaking department, as well as diplomat and mathematician Samuel Morland, who served as Thurloe&#x27;s assistant. Thurloe&#x27;s service broke the Sealed Knot, a secret society of Royalists and uncovered various other plots against the Protectorate. In 1654, he was elected to Parliament as the member for Ely.
He supported the idea that Cromwell should adopt a royal title.

In 1655, Thurloe became Postmaster General, a post he held until he was accused of treason and arrested in May 1660.
His spies were able to intercept mail, and he exposed Edward Sexby&#x27;s 1657 plot to assassinate Cromwell and captured would-be assassin Miles Sindercombe and his group. (Ironically, Thurloe&#x27;s own department was also infiltrated: in 1659 Morland became a Royalist agent and alleged that Thurloe, Richard Cromwell and Sir Richard Willis – a Sealed Knot member turned Cromwell agent – were plotting to kill the future King Charles II.) About forty years after his death, a false ceiling was found in his rooms at Lincolns Inn; the space was full of letters seized during his occupation of the office of Postmaster-General. These letters are also now at the Bodleian.

In 1657, Thurloe became a member of Cromwell&#x27;s second council, as well as governor of the London Charterhouse school, and in 1658, he became chancellor of the University of Glasgow. After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, he supported his son Richard Cromwell as Lord Protector and, in 1659, represented Cambridge University in the Third Protectorate Parliament. Later that year, various parties accused him of arbitrary decisions as head of intelligence, and he was deprived of his offices. Reinstated as a secretary of state on 27 February 1660, he resisted the return of Charles II.

After the Restoration, Thurloe was arrested for high treason on 15 May 1660 but was not tried. He was released on 29 June on the condition that he would assist the new government upon request. He retired from public life but served as a behind-the-scenes authority on foreign affairs and wrote informative papers for Edward Hyde, but he did not become part of any new government.

==Marriages and children==
He married twice:
*Firstly to a lady of the Peyton family, by whom he had two sons who died as infants;
*Secondly he married Anne Lytcott, 3rd daughter of Sir John Lytcott (died 1645), of East Molesey in Surrey, a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber who in 1633 had purchased the manor of East Molesey from Ralph Freeman. He was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, East Molesey, where survives his monument and several to members of the Clerk family, the children of his daughter Ursula, who became his heirs. Anne Lytcott&#x27;s mother was Mary Overbury, daughter of Nicholas Overbury of Bourton on the Hill in Gloucestershire and sister of the famous Sir Thomas Overbury. By Anne Lytcott he had four sons and two daughters, including:
**John Thurloe, eldest son, admitted at Lincoln&#x27;s–Inn in 1665, died at Amesbury in Wiltshire, where he was buried.
**Oliver Thurloe, 2nd son, who married but died childless.
**Thomas Thurloe, 3rd son, born in March 1650 or 1651, in about January 1676 or 1677 appointed Governor of James Island in the River Gambia, where he died.
**Nicholas Thurloe, 4th son, &quot;educated to the sea&quot;, living in 1678.
**Mary Thurloe, eldest daughter, married to Thomas Ligoe of Burcott in Buckinghamshire, by whom she had issue:
***Thomas Ligoe, married to a sister of John Hamilton;
***Eleanor Ligoe, married to the said John Hamilton.
**Anne Thurloe, 2nd daughter, married to Francis Brace of Bedford, by whom she had issue:
***John Thurloe Brace, a Member of Parliament for Bedford; ***Francis Brace;
***John Thurloe Brace, who married a lady of the name of Harris, by whom he had one son, Harris Thurloe Brace, and a daughter, Anna Maria, married to Godfrey Copley of Yorkshire.

==Death and burial==
John Thurloe died on 21 February 1668 in his chambers in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was buried in the chapel. His monument is inscribed as follows: 
:&quot;Here lyeth the body of John Thurleo, Esq; Secretary of State to the Protector Oliver Cromwell, and a member of this honourable Society. He died Feb. 21, 1667. Here lyeth the body of Francis Brace, Esq; a member of this society. He was son of Francis Brace, esq; of the town of Bedford, by Anne, one of the daughters and co–heirs of the late John Thurleo. He died on the 6th day of April 1721, in the 34th year of his age.&quot;

His correspondence is kept in the Bodleian Library, Oxford and in the British Museum. Thomas Birch published part of it in 1742.

==Landholdings==
He owned several manors including Whittlesey St Mary&#x27;s and Whittlesey St Andrew&#x27;s and an estate at Astwood in Buckinghamshire worth £400 per annum. He held the rectory of Whittlesey St Mary&#x27;s, in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire. He purchased the Wisbech Castle estate, sold off some of the land, cleared the remains of the bishop&#x27;s palace and built and furnished a mansion (demolished 1816 by Joseph Medworth) just before the Restoration of the Monarchy, after which it was restored to the Bishop of Ely. Thurloe Square, Thurloe Street and Thurloe Place in South Kensington, London, are all named after him. They were built in the 1820s on land he once owned.

==Legacy==

Apart from building his mansion in Wisbech, in 1658 he gave £50 to purchase books for the Public library and contributed eighty-one volumes and £50 for making a road &#x27;from the corn market to the little sluice&#x27; and £150, the interest to be applied towards putting out poor children apprentice.
A portrait of Thurloe was presented to Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum by D.Gurney in 1847. A photograph of this is held on the National Portrait Gallery website. There is a Thurloe Close in Wisbech.
Two of his portraits now in the local museum are in the online BBC collection.

<doc id="317572" wikidata="Q696217" url="?curid=317572" title="Shimabara Rebellion">
<text>The , also known as the or , was an uprising that occurred in the Shimabara Domain of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan from 17 December 1637 to 15 April 1638.

Matsukura Katsuie, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Shimabara Domain, enforced unpopular policies set by his father Matsukura Shigemasa that drastically raised taxes to construct the new Shimabara Castle and violently prohibited Christianity. In December 1637, an alliance of local &quot;rōnin&quot; and mostly Catholic peasants led by Amakusa Shirō rebelled against the Tokugawa shogunate due to discontent over Katsuie&#x27;s policies. The Tokugawa shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops supported by the Dutch to suppress the rebels, which defeated them after a lengthy siege against their stronghold at Hara Castle in Minamishimabara.

Following the successful suppression of the rebellion, Shirō and an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers were beheaded, and the Portuguese traders suspected of helping them were expelled from Japan. Katsuie was investigated for misruling, and was eventually beheaded in Edo, the only &quot;daimyō&quot; executed during the Edo period. The Shimabara Domain was given to Kōriki Tadafusa. Japan&#x27;s policies of national seclusion and persecution of Christianity were tightened until the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; in the 1850s. 

Shimabara Rebellion is often portrayed as a Christian rebellion against violent suppression by Matsukura Katsuie. However the main academic understanding is that the rebellion was mainly by peasants against Matsukura&#x27;s misgovernance, with Christians later joining the rebellion. 

The Shimabara Rebellion was the largest civil conflict in Japan during the Edo period, and was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate&#x27;s rule.

==Leadup and outbreak==
In the mid-1630s, the peasants of the Shimabara Peninsula and Amakusa, dissatisfied with overtaxation and suffering from the effects of famine, revolted against their lords. This was specifically in territory ruled by two lords: Matsukura Katsuie of the Shimabara Domain, and Terasawa Katataka of the Karatsu Domain. Those affected also included fishermen, craftsmen and merchants. As the rebellion spread, it was joined by &quot;rōnin&quot; (masterless samurai) who had once served extinct local clans such as the Amakusa and Shiki, as well as former Arima clan and Konishi retainers. The image of a fully &quot;peasant&quot; uprising is also not entirely accurate.

Shimabara had formerly been the domain of the Arima clan, which had been Christian; as a result, many local people were also Christian. The Arima were moved out in 1614 and replaced by the anti-Christian Matsukura. The new lord, Matsukura Shigemasa, hoped to advance in the shogunate hierarchy by sponsoring expensive construction projects, including the building and expansion of Edo Castle, and contributed funding for a planned shogunate invasion of Luzon in the Spanish East Indies, today a part of the Philippines. Matsukura also built a new castle for his own clan in Shimabara. He placed a greatly disproportionate tax burden on the people of his new domain to pay for these policies, and further angered them by strictly persecuting Christianity. The policies were continued by Shigemasa&#x27;s heir, Katsuie.

The inhabitants of the Amakusa Islands, which had been part of the fief of Konishi Yukinaga, suffered the same sort of persecution at the hands of the Terasawa family, which, like the Matsukura, had been granted the territory. Another growing problem was the presence of numerous unemployed &quot;samurai&quot;, including former retainers of Katō Tadahiro and Sassa Narimasa, both of whom had once ruled parts of Higo Province.

==Rebellion==

===Start===

The discontented &quot;rōnin&quot; of the region, joined by impoverished peasants, began to meet in secret on Yushima (also called &quot;meeting island&quot;) and plot an uprising, which broke out on 17 December 1637, when the local &quot;daikan&quot; (magistrate) Hayashi Hyōzaemon was assassinated. At the same time, others rebelled in the Amakusa Islands. The rebels quickly increased their ranks by forcing all in the areas they took to join in the uprising. A charismatic 16-year-old youth, Amakusa Shirō, soon emerged as the rebellion&#x27;s leader.

The rebels laid siege to the Terasawa clan&#x27;s Tomioka and Hondo castles, but just before the castles were about to fall, armies from the neighboring domains in Kyūshū arrived, forcing them to retreat. The rebels then crossed the Ariake Sea and briefly besieged Matsukura Katsuie&#x27;s Shimabara Castle but were again repelled. At this point they gathered near the ruins of Hara Castle, which had been the home of the Arima clan before their move to the Nobeoka Domain and was subsequently demolished. They built up palisades using the wood from the boats they had crossed the water with, and were greatly aided in their preparations by the weapons, ammunition, and provisions they had plundered from the Matsukura clan&#x27;s storehouses.

===Siege at Hara Castle===
The allied armies of the local domains, under the command of the Tokugawa shogunate (during shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu&#x27;s reign) with Itakura Shigemasa as commander-in-chief, then began their siege of Hara Castle. The legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi was present during the battle; he served as a military advisor and aide to Hosokawa Tadatoshi. Musashi was knocked off his horse by a stone thrown by a peasant rebel in one of the few verifiable records of him taking part in a campaign.

The shogunate troops requested aid from the Dutch, who provided gunpowder and cannons. Nicolaes Couckebacker, Opperhoofd of the Dutch factory (trading post) on Hirado oversaw the transfer of military stores, and when the shogunate forces requested naval support, he personally accompanied the vessel &quot;de Ryp&quot; to a position offshore, near Hara Castle. The cannons sent previously were mounted in a battery, and an all-out bombardment of the fortress commenced, both from the battery and the &quot;de Ryp&quot;″s cannons, but without great result. The ship withdrew at the request of the Japanese, following contemptuous messages sent by the rebels to the besieging troops:

Are there no longer courageous soldiers in the realm to do combat with us, and weren&#x27;t they ashamed to have called in the assistance of foreigners against our small contingent?

===Final push and fall===
Itakura Shigemasa was killed in a failed advance. More shogunate troops under Matsudaira Nobutsuna, Itakura&#x27;s replacement, soon arrived. However, the rebels at Hara Castle, who were led by well-trained former samurai, resisted the siege for months and caused the shogunate heavy losses. Both sides had a hard time fighting in winter conditions. On February 3, 1638, the rebels achieved a major victory when a surprise attack killed 2,000 warriors from the Hizen Domain. However, with their position surrounded and no means of establishing supply lines, their food and ammunition quickly ran out.

On 4 April 1638, over 27,000 rebels, facing about 125,000 shogunate soldiers mounted a desperate assault, but were soon forced to withdraw. From the survivors (including Yamada Emosaku, who was believed to have willingly betrayed the rebels), the shogunate forces learned of the rebels&#x27; poor condition and how they would likely be unable to withstand another direct attack.

On 12 April 1638, troops under the command of the Kuroda clan of Hizen stormed the fortress and captured the outer defenses. The remaining rebels continued to hold out and caused heavy casualties until they were routed three days later, on 15 April 1638.

===Forces present at Shimabara===
The Shimabara rebellion was the first massive military effort since the Siege of Osaka where the shogunate had to supervise an allied army made up of troops from various domains. The first overall commander, Itakura Shigemasa, had 800 men under his direct command; his replacement, Matsudaira Nobutsuna, had 1,500. Vice-commander Toda Ujikane had 2,500 of his own troops and 2,500 samurai of the Shimabara Domain were also present. The bulk of the shogunate&#x27;s army was drawn from Shimabara&#x27;s neighboring domains. The largest component, numbering over 35,000 men, came from the Saga Domain, and was under the command of Nabeshima Katsushige. Second in numbers were the forces of the Kumamoto and Fukuoka domains; 23,500 men under Hosokawa Tadatoshi and 18,000 men under Kuroda Tadayuki, respectively. From the Kurume Domain came 8,300 men under Arima Toyouji; from the Yanagawa Domain 5,500 men under Tachibana Muneshige; from the Karatsu Domain, 7,570 under Terasawa Katataka; from Nobeoka, 3,300 under Arima Naozumi; from Kokura, 6,000 under Ogasawara Tadazane and his senior retainer Takada Matabei; from Nakatsu, 2,500 under Ogasawara Nagatsugu; from Bungo-Takada, 1,500 under Matsudaira Shigenao, and from Kagoshima, 1,000 under Yamada Arinaga, a senior retainer of the Shimazu clan. The only non-Kyushu forces, apart from the commanders&#x27; personal troops, were 5,600 men from the Fukuyama Domain, under the command of Mizuno Katsunari, Katsutoshi, and Katsusada. A small number of troops from various other locations amounted to 800 additional men. In total, the shogunate&#x27;s army is known to have comprised over 125,800 men. The strength of the rebel forces is not precisely known, but combatants are estimated to have numbered over 14,000, while noncombatants who sheltered in the castle during the siege were over 13,000. One source estimates the total size of the rebel force as somewhere between 27,000 and 37,000, at best a quarter fraction of the size of the force sent by the shogunate.

==Aftermath==

After the castle fell, the shogunate forces executed an estimated 37,000 rebels and sympathizers as punishment. Amakusa Shirō&#x27;s severed head was taken to Nagasaki for public display, and the entire complex at Hara Castle was burned to the ground and buried, together with the bodies of all the dead.

Because the shogunate suspected that European Catholics had been involved in spreading the rebellion, Portuguese traders were driven out of the country. The policy of national seclusion was made stricter by 1639. An existing ban on the Christian religion was then enforced stringently, and Christianity in Japan survived only by going underground.

Another part of the shogunate&#x27;s actions after the rebellion was to excuse the clans which had aided its efforts militarily from the building contributions which it routinely required from various domains. However, Matsukura Katsuie&#x27;s domain was given to another lord, Kōriki Tadafusa, and Matsukura began to be pressured by the shogunate to commit honourable ritual suicide (seppuku). However, after the body of a peasant was found in his residence, proving his misrule and brutality, Matsukura was beheaded in Edo. The Terazawa Katataka&#x27;s lands were also taken from him, and he committed seppuku as well, ending his family line.

On the Shimabara peninsula, most towns experienced a severe to total loss of men as a result of the rebellion. In order to maintain the rice fields and other crops, immigrants were brought from other areas across Japan to resettle the land. All inhabitants were registered with local temples, whose priests were required to vouch for their members&#x27; religious affiliation. Following the rebellion, Buddhism was strongly promoted in the area. Certain customs were introduced which remain unique to the area today. Towns on the Shimabara peninsula also continue to have a varied mix of dialects due to the mass immigration from other parts of Japan.

With the exception of periodic, localized peasant uprisings, the Shimabara Rebellion was the last large-scale armed clash in Japan until the Boshin War.

==Memorials==

The , also known as the in the town of Reihoku, Kumamoto was erected in 1647 by Suzuki Shigenari, the first magistrate of the Amakusa islands following the rebellion. Located on a slight elevation at the sea edge, at the northwestern tip of Shimoshima Island, it is a natural andesite monolith 1.92 meters high by 82 centimeters wide and 41 centimeters thick. A &quot;kuyōtō&quot; with a Buddhist inscription, it is a form of stupa built for the purpose of memorial service so that the deceased can rest in peace. The site marks the spot where rebels assembled prior to marching on nearby Tomioka Castle, and is claimed to be the mass grave of the surviving rebels who were executed by the Tokugawa Shogunate following the end of the rebellion. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1937.

<doc id="317574" wikidata="Q219918" url="?curid=317574" title="Samora Machel">
<text>Samora Moisés Machel (29 September 1933 – 19 October 1986) was a Mozambican politician and revolutionary. A socialist in the tradition of Marxism–Leninism, he served as the first President of Mozambique from the country&#x27;s independence in 1975 until his death in a plane crash in 1986.

==Early life==
Machel was born in the village of Madragoa (today&#x27;s Chilembene), Gaza Province, Mozambique, to a family of farmers. His grandfather had been an active collaborator of Gungunhana. Under Portuguese rule, his father, like most Black Mozambicans, was classified by the demeaning term &quot;indígena&quot; (native). He was forced to accept lower prices for his crops than White farmers; compelled to grow labour-intensive cotton, which took time away from the food crops needed for his family; and forbidden to brand his mark on his cattle to prevent thievery. However, Machel&#x27;s father was a successful farmer: he owned four plows and 400 head of cattle by 1940. Machel grew up in this farming village and attended mission elementary school. In 1942, he was sent to school in the town of Zonguene in Gaza Province. The school was run by Catholic missionaries who educated the children in Portuguese language and culture. Although having completed the fourth grade, Machel never completed his secondary education. However, he had the prerequisite certificate to train as a nurse anywhere in Portugal at the time, since the nursing schools were not degree-conferring institutions.

Machel started to study nursing in the capital city of Lourenço Marques (today Maputo), beginning in 1954. In the 1950s, he saw some of the fertile lands around his farming community on the Limpopo river appropriated by the provincial government and worked by White settlers who developed a wide range of new infrastructure for the region. Like many other Mozambicans near the southern border of Mozambique, some of his relatives went to work in the South African mines where additional job opportunities were found. Shortly afterwards, one of his brothers was killed in a mining accident. Unable to complete formal training at the Miguel Bombarda Hospital in Lourenço Marques, he got a job working as an aide in the same hospital and earned enough to continue his education at night school. He worked at the hospital until he left the country to join the Mozambican nationalist struggle in neighbouring Tanzania.

==Independence struggle==
Machel was attracted to anti-colonial ideals and began his political activities in the Miguel Bombarda hospital in Lourenço Marques, where he protested against the fact that black nurses were paid less than whites doing the same job. Machel decided to leave Lourenço Marques (Maputo), when a white anti-fascist, the pharmaceutical representative João Ferreira, warned him that he was being watched by the Portuguese political police, the PIDE. He slipped across the border, and made his way to join FRELIMO in Dar es Salaam, via Swaziland, South Africa and Botswana. In Botswana, he hitched a lift on a plane carrying recruits of the African National Congress (ANC) of South Africa to Tanzania. Impressed by the young Mozambican, a senior ANC official J.B. Marks (according to Joe Slovo) bumped one of the ANC recruits off the flight to let Machel on.

In Dar es Salaam, Machel volunteered for military service, and was one of the second group of FRELIMO guerrillas sent for training in Algeria. Back in Tanzania, he was put in charge of FRELIMO&#x27;s own training camp, at Kongwa. After FRELIMO launched the independence war, on September 25, 1964, Machel soon became a key commander, making his name in particular in the grueling conditions of the eastern area of the vast and sparsely populated province of Niassa. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the guerrilla army, the FPLM, and became the head of the army after the death of its first commander, Filipe Samuel Magaia, in October 1966.

Frelimo&#x27;s founder and first president, Eduardo Mondlane, was assassinated by a parcel bomb on February 3, 1969. His deputy, Rev Uria Simango, expected to take over – but instead the FRELIMO Executive Committee appointed a presidential triumvirate, consisting of Simango, Machel and veteran nationalist and poet Marcelino dos Santos. Simango soon broke ranks, and denounced the rest of the FRELIMO leadership in the pamphlet “Gloomy Situation in Frelimo”. This led to Simango&#x27;s expulsion from the liberation front, and the election, in 1970, of Machel as Frelimo President, with dos Santos as Deputy President.

Like the late Mondlane, Machel identified himself with Marxism–Leninism, and under his leadership these positions became central to FRELIMO, which evolved from a broad front into a more Marxist party.

The new commander of the Portuguese army in Mozambique, Gen. Kaúlza de Arriaga, boasted that he would eliminate FRELIMO in a few months. He launched the largest offensive of Portugal&#x27;s colonial wars, Operation Gordian Knot, in 1970, concentrating on what was regarded as the FRELIMO heartland of Cabo Delgado in the far north. Kaúlza de Arriaga boasted of destroying a large number of guerrilla bases – but since such a base was just a collection of huts, the military significance of such supposed victories was dubious. 
Machel reacted by shifting the focus of the war elsewhere, stepping up FRELIMO operations in the western province of Tete. This was where a massive dam was being built at Cahora Bassa, on the Zambezi, to sell electricity to South Africa. Fearful that FRELIMO would attack the dam site, the Portuguese set up three concentric rings of defence around Cahora Bassa. This denuded the rest of Tete province of troops, and in 1972 FRELIMO crossed the Zambezi, striking further and further south.
By 1973, FRELIMO units were operating in Manica and Sofala Province and began to hit the railway from Rhodesia to Beira, causing panic among the settler population of Beira, who accused the Portuguese army of not doing enough to defend white interests.

The end came suddenly. On April 25, 1974, Portuguese officers, tired of fighting three unwinnable wars in Africa, overthrew the government in Lisbon. The coup was almost bloodless. Nobody came onto the streets to defend Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano. Within 24 hours, the Armed Forces Movement (MFA) was in full control of Portugal.

==Independence==

Frelimo&#x27;s immediate warning was that there was no such thing as democratic colonialism, and that nobody should imagine that Mozambicans would tolerate Portuguese rule just because there had been a change of government in Lisbon.
Frelimo&#x27;s fears were well-founded. The MFA allowed General António de Spínola to become the first post-coup President. He had been commander of the Portuguese forces in Guinea-Bissau, then Portuguese Guinea, and was believed to be deeply implicated in the assassination of the Guinean nationalist leader, Amílcar Cabral.
Spinola had no intention of letting Mozambique and Angola go. He dreamed of a Lusophone commonwealth run from Lisbon, and wanted a referendum on independence. Machel rejected such plans with the pithy remark: &quot;You don&#x27;t ask a slave if he wants to be free, particularly when he is already in revolt, and much less if you happen to be a slave-owner&quot;.
Initial discussions between Frelimo and the new Portuguese government, held in Lusaka in June 1974, proved fruitless. It was clear to Machel that the Portuguese foreign minister, Socialist Party leader Mário Soares, had no power to negotiate independence. So Machel sent one of his top advisers, Aquino de Bragança, to Lisbon to find out who really held power in Portugal. His answer was that Frelimo should really be talking to the MFA, particular to military intellectuals such as Col. Ernesto Melo Antunes, whose power was on the rise, as that of Spinola waned.
Machel refused to give the Portuguese the ceasefire they wanted. For as long as there was no commitment to Mozambican independence, the war would continue. Frelimo re-opened its front in Zambezia province, and stepped up operations throughout the war zone.
There was little resistance. Following the collapse of the Caetano government, rank and file Portuguese soldiers saw little point in continuing to fight, preferring to stay in their barracks.
More serious talks between the Lisbon government and Frelimo ensued, and this time the MFA played a dominant role. The result was an agreement, signed in Lusaka on September 7, 1974, which agreed to transfer full power to Frelimo with the date for independence set for June 25, 1975. That day there was a short-lived settler revolt against the agreement, put down within a day by Portuguese and Frelimo troops acting jointly. A transitional government was set up, containing ministers appointed by both Frelimo and Portugal, but headed by Frelimo&#x27;s Joaquim Chissano as Prime Minister. Machel continued to run Frelimo from Tanzania. He returned home triumphantly, in a journey &quot;from the Rovuma to the Maputo&quot; (the rivers marking the northern and southern boundaries of the country), in which he addressed rallies in every major population centre in the country.
The journey was interrupted at the beach resort of Tofo, in Inhambane Province, for a meeting of the Frelimo Central Committee, which drew up Mozambique&#x27;s first Constitution. This gave the outline of the one-party, socialist state which Frelimo intended to establish. Frelimo was constitutionally the leading force in Mozambican society, and the President of Frelimo would automatically be President of Mozambique.
On June 25, 1975, Machel proclaimed &quot;the total and complete independence of Mozambique and its constitution into the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique&quot;. This, he said, would be &quot;a state of People&#x27;s Democracy, in which, under the leadership of the worker-peasant alliance, all patriotic strata commit themselves to the destruction of the sequels of colonialism, and to annihilate the system of exploitation of man by man&quot;.
Machel&#x27;s government moved quickly to bring key areas under state control. All land was nationalized – individuals and institutions could not hold land, but leased it from the state. On July 24, 1975, just a month after independence, all health and education institutions were nationalized. National health and education services were set up, and all private schools and clinics were abolished. The Catholic Church immediately lost the privileged position it had held in these areas. On February 3, 1976, the government nationalized all rented housing. “Landlords? What do we want landlords for in our country for?”, asked Machel at the rally announcing the measure. Private ownership of houses was not banned. Anyone, Mozambican or foreign, could own a house for their own use - but building private property for rent was forbidden. This changed the face of Mozambican cities – black Mozambicans moved from the suburbs into blocks in the centre of the cities, occupying houses and flats, once owned by Portuguese landlords, and many of which had now been abandoned.
In February 1977, at its 3rd Congress, Frelimo declared that it was now a Marxist–Leninist party, dedicated to the building of socialism, based on the “worker-peasant alliance”. The Congress re-elected Machel as President of Frelimo, and thus automatically as President of the Republic.
Frelimo was reorganized into &quot;celulas&quot; (“branches”) throughout the county. The party was to be a Leninist vanguard, and state institutions, at whatever level, were to be subordinate to the party. In 1978 elections were held. Since this was a one-party state, there was no organized opposition. Instead, candidates were presented by Frelimo at meetings – and were sometimes rejected when people complained of offences ranging from wife-beating and drunkenness to acting as an informer for the PIDE during the colonial government.
Frelimo faced a hostile environment, with the white minority governments of Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa on Mozambique&#x27;s borders. In March 1976, Machel&#x27;s government implemented United Nations sanctions against the Smith government, and closed the borders with Rhodesia. In retaliation, Smith&#x27;s Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) recruited dissatisfied Mozambicans and former Portuguese settlers and helped set up an anti-Frelimo movement. Initially this “Mozambique National Resistance” operated as an auxiliary branch of the Rhodesian armed forces. Frelimo dismissed them as “armed bandits”.

As part of the measures accompanying the new Frelimo government, Machel introduced &quot;reeducation centers&quot; in which petty criminals, political opponents, and alleged anti-social elements such as prostitutes and drug users were imprisoned, often without trial. The conditions in these centers were harsh. Although there is a lack of reliable figures, Benedito Machava estimated that over a thousand inmates may have died due to starvation, disease, punishments or execution. In discussing Machel&#x27;s role, Machava stated that the president took on a &quot;salvationist stance&quot;, influenced both by Christianity and Maoism, which led him to believe in the beneficial effects of reeducation for enforcing his vision of social and moral purity. Despite the abuses and harsh conditions, there was also an emphasis on rehabilitation. For example, in 1979-80, three reeducation centers were closed, leading to the reintegration of 2600 former inmates (including hundreds of &quot;political offenders&quot;) into society. In an October 1981 speech, Machel himself acknowledged and criticized the existence of lengthy arbitrary detentions.

However, Machel was unapologetic about the repression of dissidents inside and outside FRELIMO. In 1975, he had made a public appearance at the Nachingwea military camp for a lengthy show trial of former FRELIMO militants who had opposed the party&#x27;s power consolidation, including Paulo Gumane and Uria Simango. Under pressure, the captives confessed to a variety of serious crimes. They are presumed to have been executed sometime in the years that followed; according to a 1995 report by Jose Pinto de Sa and Nelson Saute, they were burned alive by a convoy of soldiers in 1977.

==Rhodesian Bush War==
Frelimo had longstanding links with Zimbabwean nationalist movements. Even during the independence war, guerrillas of ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army), the armed wing of ZANU (Zimbabwe African National Union), were able to operate from Frelimo-held areas in Tete province into northern areas of Rhodesia. After the implementation of the UN sanctions against the Rhodesian government, the entire length of the border was now available for nationalist incursions into Rhodesia.
ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, released from Salisbury Prison, Rhodesia in 1974, made his way into Mozambique the following year. Initially, Machel was suspicious of the apparent coup within ZANU that had brought Mugabe to power, and he was effectively rusticated to the central city of Quelimane, where he taught English. Tired of the divisions within Zimbabwean nationalism, Machel sponsored an alternative to both ZANU and its rival ZAPU. This was the Zimbabwean People&#x27;s Army (ZIPA), which took credit for many operations in eastern Zimbabwe, and was enthusiastically promoted by the Mozambican media. But it soon turned out that the dominant force within ZIPA were ZANLA guerrillas who had never abandoned their loyalty to ZANU and to Mugabe.
Machel accepted the reality that the people doing most of the fighting in Zimbabwe were ZANLA. To bring the war to a successful conclusion, Machel embarked on a dual strategy, military and diplomatic. He sent Mozambican units into Zimbabwe to fight alongside ZANU guerrillas, while also insisting that the new British Conservative government, under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, should resume its responsibilities as the colonial power.
The UK Government hosted a conference at Lancaster House in London, aimed at ending White minority rule and drawing up a constitution for an independent Zimbabwe. Mozambicans, notably Machel&#x27;s British-trained advisor, Fernando Honwana, were in London to advise the ZANU delegation – and ensured that Mugabe accepted the Lancaster House Agreement, despite its failure to solve the land question, with a small minority of white commercial farmers still holding most of the country&#x27;s fertile farmland. Machel, with his own intelligence teams on the ground, was certain that ZANU would win any fair election. Indeed, ZANU won 57 of the 80 seats reserved for Black Zimbabweans, while the second nationalist movement, ZAPU, won 20. Ian Smith&#x27;s Rhodesian Front took the 20 seats, which Mugabe had reluctantly agreed to allocate to the Whites.

Machel was fully aware of the dangerous ethnic divisions in Zimbabwe, with ZANU drawing most of its support from the Shona majority, and ZAPU from the minority Ndebele people. On his first state visit to Zimbabwe, in 1980, Machel gave a warning: &quot;To ensure national unity, there must be no Shonas in Zimbabwe, there must be no Ndebeles in Zimbabwe, there must be Zimbabweans. Some people are proud of their tribalism. But we call tribalists reactionary agents of the enemy&quot;.

==Civil War==
In 1977, a rebel army known as RENAMO launched a rebellion backed by Rhodesia, plunging the country into civil war. Following the collapse of Smith&#x27;s government, the rebel force began to receive backing from South Africa. The movement was initially known as the RNM (translated into English as MNR), but as from 2003 adopted the acronym Renamo.
During the 1980s, the South African government took an increasingly hostile attitude to the Front Line States. Mozambique, in particular, was accused of harbouring military bases of the African National Congress. On June 30, 1981, South African commandos attacked three houses in the southern city of Matola, killing 12 ANC members as well as a Portuguese electrician. While those killed were members of the ANC&#x27;s armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK - Spear of the Nation), the houses were not a guerrilla base, as visiting diplomats and journalists soon confirmed. A fortnight later, Machel threw down the gauntlet. At a rally in Maputo&#x27;s independence square, he embraced ANC leader Oliver Tambo and declared &quot;They want to come here and commit murder. So we say: Let them come! Let all the racists come!... Let the South Africans come, but let them be clear that the war will end in Pretoria!&quot;
Helped by weapons airdropped by the South African Defence Force (SADF), Renamo spread its operations across the entire country with the exception of the far north. Frelimo reacted with a series of authoritarian measures, some of which deeply shocked its supporters inside and outside the country. The death penalty, already in force for serious security offences, was now extended to a range of economic crimes. In addition, corporal punishment was imposed as a penalty for a range of offences. Both laws fell into disuse within a year or so but had done severe damage to Frelimo&#x27;s image. It is widely believed that, at about this time, former Frelimo officials regarded as “traitors” were executed, including Simango and his wife Celina. To this day, Frelimo has published nothing about the circumstances of the execution, though in the Mozambican parliament, in 1995, former security minister Sergio Vieira publicly confirmed “the traitors were executed”. Renamo supporters published colourful versions claiming that the executions happened in 1977, but a date of 1983 seems more likely. In either case, this violated a promise which Machel gave to the Tanzanian and Zambian Presidents, Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda in 1975.
At the Frelimo Fourth Congress, in April 1983, Frelimo reaffirmed its commitment to Marxism, but admitted economic mistakes, particularly in agriculture. Machel was re-elected President of Frelimo, and once again warmly embraced Oliver Tambo.
But the deteriorating military and economic situation drove Frelimo to give the apartheid government what it said it wanted – a non-aggression pact. On March 16, 1984, on a railway carriage in the non-man&#x27;s land between South Africa and Mozambique, Machel and South African President P. W. Botha signed the Nkomati Accord on Non-Aggression and Good Neighbourliness. The deal expressed in the agreement was extremely simple – South Africa would drop its support for Renamo in exchange for Mozambique dropping support for the ANC.
Machel only partially honoured commitments to expel various ANC members from his territory. South African support for Renamo did not stop – massive shipments of arms were airlifted to Renamo immediately prior to the Accord, and a senior South African official, Deputy Foreign Minister Louis Nel, even visited the Renamo base at Casa Banana in Gorongosa district, using an airstrip which South Africa had helped Renamo build. In mid-1985, the Mozambican and Zimbabwean armed forces launched a joint offensive to drive Renamo out of Gorongosa. Zimbabwean paratroopers ensured the capture of Casa Banana, but Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama fled north, and re-established the Renamo HQ in the district of Maringué. Visiting Casa Banana on September 5, Machel was optimistic. &quot;We have broken the back of the snake, but the tail will still thrash around,&quot; he said.
But in fact, the war continued, although its focus shifted northwards to Zambezia and Tete provinces, with Renamo operating with impunity out of Malawi. Machel loathed the Malawian &quot;life President&quot; Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who was the only leader of an independent African state who had established diplomatic relations with Pretoria. After an unsuccessful meeting with Banda, Machel openly threatened to place missiles on the Mozambique-Malawi border and to prevent trade from landlocked Malawi passing through Mozambican territory.

==Fatal aircrash and investigations==
On 19 October 1986, Machel attended a summit in Mbala, Zambia, called to put pressure on Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, over his support for the Angolan opposition movement UNITA. The strategy of the Front Line States was to move against Mobutu and Banda in an attempt to end their support for UNITA and Renamo, who they regarded as South African surrogates. Although the Zambian authorities invited Machel to stay in Mbala overnight, he insisted on returning to Maputo. He had a meeting scheduled for the following morning at which he intended to reshuffle the leadership of the armed forces. Machel thus overrode the instruction from the Security Ministry that the President should not travel at night – with fatal consequences. The plane never reached Maputo. That night it crashed into a hillside at Mbuzini, just inside South Africa. Machel and 33 others died. Nine people sitting at the back of the plane survived.

The Margo Commission, set up by the South African government, but which included high-level international representation, investigated the incident and concluded that the accident was caused by pilot error. Despite the acceptance of its findings by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the report was rejected by the Mozambican and Soviet governments. The latter submitted a minority report suggesting that the aircraft was intentionally lured off course by a decoy radio navigation beacon set up specifically for this purpose by the South Africans. Speculation about the accident has therefore continued to the present day, particularly in Mozambique.

Hans Louw, a Civil Cooperation Bureau operative, claims to have helped bring about Machel&#x27;s death. Pik Botha, South African foreign affairs minister at the time, who later joined the ANC, said that the investigation into the plane crash should be re-opened.

The Portuguese journalist, , who lived in Moscow from 1977 to 2015 and currently works for the Portuguese newspaper &quot;Público&quot; and as a correspondent for the Portuguese television channel &quot;SIC&quot;, maintains that the plane crash had nothing to do with any attempt or any mechanical failure, but was due to several errors of the Russian crew (including the pilot), who, instead of diligently performing their duties, were busy with futile things, like sharing alcoholic and soft drinks unavailable in Mozambique that they had had the possibility to bring from Zambia. In Milhazes&#x27; opinion, both the Soviet and the Mozambican authorities had an interest to spread the thesis of an attempt by the South African government: the Soviets wanted to safeguard their reputation (exempting the plane and the crew from any responsibility), the Mozambicans wanted to create a hero.

In 2007, however, Jacinto Veloso, one of Machel&#x27;s most unconditional supporters within Frelimo, had sustained in his memoirs that Machel&#x27;s death was due to a conspiracy between the South African and the Soviet secret services, both of which had reasons to get rid of him. According to Veloso, the Soviet ambassador once asked the President for an audience to convey the USSR&#x27;s concern about Mozambique&#x27;s apparent &quot;sliding away&quot; towards the West, to which Machel supposedly replied &quot;Vai à merda!&quot; (Go to hell!). Having then commanded the interpreter to translate, he left the room. Convinced that Machel had irrevocably moved away from their orbit, the Soviets allegedly did not hesitate to sacrifice the pilot and the whole crew of their own plane.

==Funeral and burial==
Machel&#x27;s state funeral was held in Maputo on 28 October 1986. It was attended by numerous political leaders and other notable people from Africa and elsewhere, including Dr. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Dr. Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Dr. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, King Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho, Dr. Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Dr. Yasser Arafat of Palestinian State. Also present were the ANC leader Oliver Tambo, the U.S. President&#x27;s daughter Maureen Reagan, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the Soviet Union Heidar Aliyev, and the civil rights leader, Jesse Jackson.

At the funeral, the acting leader of Frelimo, Marcelino dos Santos, said in a speech: &quot;The shock of your journey from which there is no return still shudders through the body of the entire nation. You fell in the struggle against apartheid… You understood apartheid as a problem for all humanity.&quot;

Samora Machel was buried in a star-shaped crypt at Mozambican Heroes&#x27; Square, a traffic junction in Maputo.

==Marriages and family life==

In the late 1950s, when Machel was working as a nurse on Inhaca Island, he met a local girl, Sorita Tchaiakomo, and set up house with her. Their first child, Joscelina, was born on Inhaca in 1958. Idelson (1959) and Olívia (1961) were both born after the family returned to the mainland, where they lived in Mafalala, a suburb of Lourenço Marques. Machel returned to the Miguel Bombarda Hospital and was accepted onto a course of further training. At the hospital he began a relationship with another nurse, Irene Buque. She gave birth to their daughter Ornila in February 1963, three weeks before Machel left Mozambique to join Frelimo. N’tewane, Tchaiakomo&#x27;s fourth child with Machel, was born that September, six months after Machel had left the country. Later, Machel expressed remorse for what he had come to see as bad behaviour towards Sorita and Irene.

Machel was not married to either Tchaiakomo or Buque. When he joined Frelimo in 1963 it was widely believed that the war for independence would last years, if not decades, and that the chances of Frelimo cadres being reunited with their families in Mozambique were vanishingly small. Josina Abiatar Muthemba, who had been active in the anti-colonial student organisation NESAM, arrived in Tanzania in 1965, on her second attempt to flee Mozambique. In Tanzania she worked first as an assistant to Janet Mondlane, Eduardo Mondlane&#x27;s wife and director of the Mozambique Institute. She became one of the earliest recruits to the Women&#x27;s Detachment of the guerrilla army, and campaigned vigorously for women&#x27;s full inclusion within all aspects of the liberation struggle. She and Machel were married at Tunduru in southern Tanzania in May 1969. In November their only son Samora, known as Samito, was born. Josina returned to work as head of Social Affairs, with special responsibility for the welfare of war orphans, and for the health and education of all children in the war zones of northern Mozambique. But she felt increasingly unwell. In 1970 she travelled to the Soviet Union to seek a diagnosis for her chronic ill-health, but to no avail. She was probably suffering from leukaemia, although pancreatic cancer is another possibility. She died on April 7, 1971, aged twenty-five. Machel was devastated.

Machel&#x27;s second wife, Graça Simbine, joined Frelimo in 1973 after graduating in modern languages from Lisbon University. She worked as a teacher, first in Frelimo-held areas in Cabo Delgado province, and then at the Frelimo school in Tanzania. She became Minister for Education and Culture in newly independent Mozambique. She and Machel were married three months after Independence, in September 1975. In April 1976 a daughter, Josina, was born, and in December 1978 a son, Malengane. At Independence Machel&#x27;s five older children joined Josina Machel&#x27;s son Samito in the Presidential household. In 1998, twelve years after Samora Machel&#x27;s death, Graça Machel married Nelson Mandela, President of South Africa, thus becoming the only woman to have been First Lady of two countries.

==International relationships==

Samora Machel established a strong relationship with Italy, because of its interest in fighting apartheid and Portuguese colonialism. In particular, the city of Reggio Emilia organized many initiatives to draw Italian attention to the great political problems of southern Africa. On 24 and 25 March 1973, Machel took part in the first &quot;National Conference of solidarity against colonialism and imperialism for freedom and independence of Mozambique, Angola and Guinea Bissau&quot;. 
When Reggio Emilia sent the first solidarity ship &quot;Amanda&quot;, Machel welcomed it at the port of Maputo. He said: &quot;Solidarity is not a charity act. It&#x27;s cooperation, mutual support between peoples striving to reach the same goal. This ship brings peace, it brings the solidarity of the whole Italian people for every population.&quot;
He returned to visit Reggio Emilia in 1981.

===Memorial===

A memorial at the Mbuzini crash site was inaugurated on January 19, 1999, by Nelson Mandela and his wife Graça, and by President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique. Now the monument is made professional and the memorial service is held on October 19 each year. Designed by Mozambican architect José Forjaz, at a cost to the South African government of 1.5 million Rand (US$300,000), the monument comprises 35 steel tubes symbolising the number of lives lost in the air crash. At least eight foreigners were killed there, including the four Soviet crew members, Machel&#x27;s two Cuban doctors and the Zambian and Zairean ambassadors to Mozambique.

There is a large street in downtown Dar es Salaam, the de facto capital of Tanzania, called Samora Avenue. One of the largest streets in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, was renamed Samora Machel Avenue (from Jameson Avenue) after independence in a gesture of gratitude for Machel&#x27;s support for black liberation activities before majority rule. Also, a street in Moscow bears his name and the Zimbabwean band R.U.N.N. family had a hit song that mourned his loss.

<text>Sarah Baartman (; 1789 – 29 December 1815), also spelled Sara, sometimes in the diminutive form Saartje (), or Saartjie, and Bartman, Bartmann, was a Khoekhoe woman who was exhibited as a freak show attraction in 19th-century Europe under the name Hottentot Venus, a name that was later attributed to at least one other woman similarly exhibited. The women were exhibited for their steatopygic body type uncommon in Western Europe that was perceived as a curiosity at that time, and became subject of scientific interest as well as of erotic projection.

&quot;Venus&quot; is sometimes used to designate representations of the female body in arts and cultural anthropology, referring to the Roman goddess of love and fertility. &quot;Hottentot&quot; was a Dutch-colonial era term for the indigenous Khoekhoe people of southwestern Africa, which then became commonly used in English,and was shortened to &quot;hotnot&quot; as an offensive term, the term &quot;Hottentot&quot; refers to the tribe, eg. Zulu, Xhosa. The Sarah Baartman story is the epitome of racist colonial exploitation, and of the commodification and dehumanization of black people.

==Life==

===Early life in the Cape Colony ===
Baartman was born to a [Xhosa and Khoekhoe] family in the vicinity of the Camdeboo Dutch Cape Colony; a British colony by the time she was an adult. Her birth name is unknown, but is thought by some to have been Ssehura, supposedly the closest to her given name. Saartjie is the diminutive form of Sarah; in Cape Dutch the use of the diminutive form commonly indicated familiarity, endearment or contempt. Her surname has also been spelt Bartman and Bartmann. She was an infant when her mother died and her father was later killed by Bushmen (San people) while driving cattle.

Baartman spent her childhood and teenage years on Dutch European farms. She went through puberty rites, and kept a small tortoise shell necklace, most likely her mother&#x27;s, until her death in France. In the 1790s, a free black (a designation for people of enslaved descent) trader named Peter Cesars (also recorded as Caesar) met her and encouraged her to move to Cape Town. She lived in Cape Town for at least two years working in households as a washerwoman and a nursemaid, first for Peter Cesars, then in the house of a Dutch man in Cape Town. She finally moved to be a wet-nurse in the household of Peter Cesars&#x27; brother, Hendrik Cesars, outside Cape Town in present day Woodstock. There is evidence that she had two children, though both died as babies. She had a relationship with a poor Dutch soldier, Hendrik van Jong, who lived in Hout Bay near Cape Town, but the relationship ended when his regiment left the Cape.

Hendrik Cesars began to show her at the city hospital in exchange for cash, where surgeon Alexander Dunlop worked. Dunlop, (sometimes wrongly cited as William Dunlop), a Scottish military surgeon in the Cape slave lodge, operated a side business in supplying showmen in Britain with animal specimens, and suggested she travel to Europe to make money by exhibiting herself. Baartman refused. Dunlop persisted, and Baartman said she would not go unless Hendrik Cesars came too. He agreed in 1810 to go to Britain to make money by putting Baartman on stage. It is unknown whether Baartman went willingly or was forced, although the acceptance of her earlier refusal could mean that she was coerced, or simply changed her mind when joined by Cesars.

Dunlop was the frontman and driver of the plan to exhibit Baartman. According to a British legal report of 26 November 1810, an affidavit supplied to the Court of King&#x27;s Bench from a &quot;Mr. Bullock of Liverpool Museum&quot; stated: &quot;some months since a Mr. Alexander Dunlop, who, he believed, was a surgeon in the army, came to him to sell the skin of a Camelopard, which he had brought from the Cape of Good Hope... Some time after, Mr. Dunlop again called on Mr. Bullock, and told him, that he had then on her way from the Cape, a female Hottentot, of very singular appearance; that she would make the fortune of any person who shewed her in London, and that he (Dunlop) was under an engagement to send her back in two years...&quot; Lord Caledon, governor of the Cape, gave permission for the trip, but later said he regretted it after he fully learned the purpose of the trip.

=== On display in Europe ===
Hendrik Cesars and Alexander Dunlop brought Baartman to London in 1810. The group lived together in Duke Street, St. James, the most expensive part of London. In the household were Sarah Baartman, Hendrik Cesars, Alexander Dunlop, and two African boys, possibly brought illegally by Dunlop from the slave lodge in Cape Town.

Dunlop had to have Baartman exhibited and Cesars was the showman. Dunlop exhibited Baartman at the Egyptian Room at the London residence of Thomas Hope at No. 10 Duchess Street, Cavendish Square, London. Dunlop thought he could make money because of Londoners&#x27; lack of familiarity with Africans and because of Baartman&#x27;s pejoratively perceived large buttocks. Crais and Scully allege that: &quot;People came to see her because they saw her not as a person but as a pure example of this one part of the natural world&quot;. She became known as the &quot;Hottentot Venus&quot; (as was at least one other woman, in 1829). A handwritten note made on an exhibition flyer by someone who saw Baartman in London in January 1811 indicates curiosity about her origins and probably reproduced some of the language from the exhibition; thus the following origin story should be treated with skepticism: &quot;Sartjee is 22 Years old is 4 feet 10 Inches high, and has (for a Hottentot) a good capacity. She lived in the occupation of a Cook at the Cape of Good Hope. Her Country is situated not less than 600 Miles from the Cape, the Inhabitants of which are rich in Cattle and sell them by barter for a mere trifle. A Bottle of Brandy, or small roll of Tobacco will purchase several Sheep – Their principal trade is in Cattle Skins or Tallow. – Beyond this Nation is an other, of small stature, very subtle &amp; fierce; the Dutch could not bring them under subjection, and shot them whenever they found them. 9 Jany, 1811. [H.C.?]&quot; The tradition of freak shows was well established in Europe at this time, and historians have argued that this is at first how Baartman was displayed. Baartman never allowed herself to be exhibited nude, and an account of her appearance in London in 1810 makes it clear that she was wearing a garment, albeit a tight-fitting one. She became a subject of scientific interest, albeit of racist bias frequently, as well as of erotic projection. It is alleged she was marketed as the &quot;missing link between man and beast&quot;. 

Her exhibition in London just a few years after the passing of the 1807 Slave Trade Act, which abolished the slave trade, created a scandal. A British abolitionist society, the African Association, conducted a newspaper campaign for her release. The British abolitionist Zachary Macaulay led the protest, with Hendrik Cesars protesting in response that Baartman was entitled to earn her living, stating: &quot;has she not as good a right to exhibit herself as an Irish Giant or a Dwarf?&quot; Cesars was comparing Baartman to the contemporary Irish giants Charles Byrne and Patrick Cotter O&#x27;Brien. Macaulay and The African Association took the matter to court and on 24 November 1810 at the Court of King&#x27;s Bench the Attorney-General began the attempt &quot;to give her liberty to say whether she was exhibited by her own consent.&quot; In support he produced two affidavits in court. The first, from William Bullock of Liverpool Museum, was intended to show that Baartman had been brought to Britain by people who referred to her as if she were property. The second, by the Secretary of the African Association, described the degrading conditions under which she was exhibited and also gave evidence of coercion. Baartman was then questioned before an attorney in Dutch, in which she was fluent, via interpreters.

Some historians have subsequently expressed doubts on the veracity and independence of the statement that Baartman then made, although there remains no direct evidence that she was lying. She stated that she was not under restraint, had not been sexually abused and had come to London on her own free will. She also did not wish to return to her family and understood perfectly that she was guaranteed half of the profits. The case was therefore dismissed. She was questioned for three hours. Her statement contradicts accounts of her exhibitions made by Zachary Macaulay of the African Institution and other eyewitnesses. A written contract was produced, which has been suggested by some interested modern commentators to be a legal subterfuge.

The publicity given by the court case increased Baartman&#x27;s popularity as an exhibit. She later toured other parts of England and was exhibited at a fair in Limerick, Ireland in 1812. She also was exhibited at a fair at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk. On 1 December 1811 Baartman was baptised at Manchester Cathedral and there is evidence that she got married on the same day.

===Later life ===
If indeed she had come to England of her own free will, her situation appears to have changed when she travelled to France. A man called Henry Taylor took Baartman there around September 1814. Taylor then sold her to a man sometimes reported as an animal trainer, S. Réaux, but whose name was actually Jean Riaux and belonged to a ballet master who had been deported from the Cape Colony for seditious behaviour. Riaux exhibited her under more pressured conditions for 15 months at the Palais Royal in Paris. In France she may have been in effect enslaved, although her exact position remains unclear. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with scientific racism. French scientists were curious about whether she had the elongated labia which earlier naturalists such as François Levaillant had purportedly observed other Khoekhoe women to have at the Cape. French naturalists, among them Georges Cuvier, head keeper of the menagerie at the Muséum national d&#x27;Histoire naturelle and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy, visited her. She was the subject of several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi, where she was examined in March 1815.

She was brought out as an exhibit at wealthy people&#x27;s parties and private salons. In Paris, Baartman&#x27;s promoters did not need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully suggest: &quot;By the time she got to Paris, her existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor&quot;. At some points a collar was placed around her neck (although it is unclear whether that was just a prop for the performance). Specifically, she was exhibited with a collar on some occasions. At the end of her life she was penniless, which was probably connected to the economic depression in France after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, resulting in a dearth of audiences that were able and willing to pay to see her. According to present-day accounts in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, she was also working as a prostitute, but the biography by Crais and Scully only notes that as an uncertain possibility (since she was exhibited, besides other places, at the brothel in Cours des Fontaines).

== Death and aftermath ==
Baartman died on 29 December 1815 around age 26, of an undetermined inflammatory ailment, possibly smallpox, while other sources suggest she contracted syphilis, or pneumonia. Cuvier conducted a dissection but no autopsy to inquire into the reasons for Baartman&#x27;s death.

The French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville published notes on the dissection in 1816, which were republished by Georges Cuvier in the &quot;Memoires du Museum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; in 1817. Cuvier, who had met Baartman, notes in his monograph that its subject was an intelligent woman with an excellent memory, particularly for faces. In addition to her native tongue, she spoke fluent Dutch, passable English, and a smattering of French. He describes her shoulders and back as &quot;graceful&quot;, arms &quot;slender&quot;, hands and feet as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;pretty&quot;. He adds she was adept at playing the Jew&#x27;s harp, could dance according to the traditions of her country, and had a lively personality. Despite this, Cuvier interpreted her remains as evidencing ape-like traits. He thought her small ears were similar to those of an orangutan and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a monkey. He was part of a movement of scientists who sought to identify and study differences between human races, with the aim of theorising a racial hierarchy.

===Display of remains===
Saint-Hilaire applied on behalf of the Muséum d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle to retain her remains (Cuvier had preserved her brain, genitalia and skeleton), on the grounds that it was of a singular specimen of humanity and therefore of special scientific interest. The application was approved and Baartman&#x27;s skeleton and body cast were displayed in Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle d’Angers. Her skull was stolen in 1827 but returned a few months later. The restored skeleton and skull continued to arouse the interest of visitors until the remains were moved to the Musée de l&#x27;Homme, when it was founded in 1937, and continued up until the late 1970s. Her body cast and skeleton stood side by side and faced away from the viewer which emphasised her steatopygia (accumulation of fat on the buttocks) while reinforcing that aspect as the primary interest of her body. The Baartman exhibit proved popular until it elicited complaints for being a degrading representation of women. The skeleton was removed in 1974, and the body cast in 1976.

From the 1940s, there were sporadic calls for the return of her remains. A poem written in 1998 by South African poet Diana Ferrus, herself of Khoekhoe descent, entitled &quot;I&#x27;ve come to take you home&quot;, played a pivotal role in spurring the movement to bring Baartman&#x27;s remains back to her birth soil. The case gained world-wide prominence only after American paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; in the 1980s. Mansell Upham, a researcher and jurist specializing in colonial South African history, also helped spur the movement to bring Baartman&#x27;s remains back to South Africa. After the victory of the African National Congress (ANC) in the 1994 South African general election, President Nelson Mandela formally requested that France return the remains. After much legal wrangling and debates in the French National Assembly, France acceded to the request on 6 March 2002. Her remains were repatriated to her homeland, the Gamtoos Valley, on 6 May 2002, and they were buried on 9 August 2002 on &quot;Vergaderingskop&quot;, a hill in the town of Hankey over 200 years after her birth.

=== Symbolism ===
Sarah Baartman was not the only Khoekhoe to be taken from her homeland. Her story is sometimes used to illustrate social and political strains, and through this, some facts have been lost. Dr. Yvette Abrahams, professor of women and gender studies at the University of the Western Cape, writes, &quot;we lack academic studies that view Sarah Baartman as anything other than a symbol. Her story becomes marginalized, as it is always used to illustrate some other topic.&quot; Baartman is used to represent African discrimination and suffering in the West although there were many other Khoekhoe people who were taken to Europe. Historian Neil Parsons writes of two Khoekhoe children 13 and six years old respectively, who were taken from South Africa and displayed at a holiday fair in Elberfeld, Prussia, in 1845. &quot;Bosjemans&quot;, a travelling show including two Khoekhoe men, women, and a baby, toured Britain, Ireland, and France from 1846 to 1855. P. T. Barnum&#x27;s show &quot;Little People&quot; advertised a 16-year-old Khoekhoe girl named Flora as the &quot;missing link&quot; and acquired six more Khoekhoe children later.

Baartman&#x27;s tale may be better known because she was the first Khoekhoe taken from her homeland, or because of the extensive exploitation and examination of her body by scientists such as Georges Cuvier, an anatomist, and the public as well as the mistreatment she received during and after her lifetime. She was brought to the West for her &quot;exaggerated&quot; female form, and the European public developed an obsession with her reproductive organs. Her body parts were on display at the Musée de l&#x27;Homme for 150 years, sparking awareness and sympathy in the public eye. Although Baartman was the first Khoekhoe to land in Europe, much of her story has been lost, and she is defined by her exploitation in the West.

==Her body as a foundation for science==

Julien-Joseph Virey used Sarah Baartman&#x27;s published image to validate typologies. In his essay &quot;Dictionnaire des sciences medicales&quot; (Dictionary of medical sciences), he summarizes the true nature of the black female within the framework of accepted medical discourse. Virey focused on identifying her sexual organs as more developed and distinct in comparison to white female organs. All of his theories regarding sexual primitivism are influenced and supported by the anatomical studies and illustrations of Sarah Baartman which were created by Georges Cuvier.

It has been suggested by anthropologists that this body type was once more widespread in humans, based on carvings of female forms dating to the Paleolithic era which are collectively known as Venus figurines, also referred to as Steatopygian Venuses.

===Colonialism===
Much speculation and study about colonialist influence relates to Baartman&#x27;s name, social status, her illustrated and performed presentation as the &quot;Hottentot Venus&quot;, although considered an extremely offensive term, and the negotiation for her body&#x27;s return to her homeland. These components and events in Baartman&#x27;s life have been used by activists and theorists to determine the ways in which 19th-century European colonists exercised control and authority over Khoekhoe people and simultaneously crafted racist and sexist ideologies about their culture. In addition to this, recent scholars have begun to analyze the surrounding events leading up to Baartman&#x27;s return to her homeland and conclude that it is an expression of recent contemporary post colonial objectives.

In Janet Shibamoto&#x27;s book review of Deborah Cameron&#x27;s book &quot;Feminism and Linguistic Theory&quot;, Shibamoto discusses Cameron&#x27;s study on the patriarchal context within language, which consequentially influences the way in which women continue to be contained by or subject to ideologies created by the patriarchy. Many scholars have presented information on how Baartman&#x27;s life was heavily controlled and manipulated by colonialist and patriarchal language.

Baartman grew up on a farm. There is no historical documentation of her birth name. She was given the Dutch name &quot;Saartjie&quot; by Dutch colonists who occupied the land she lived on during her childhood. According to Clifton Crais and Pamela Scully:

Her first name is the Cape Dutch form for &quot;Sarah&quot; which marked her as a colonialist&#x27;s servant. &quot;Saartje&quot; the diminutive, was also a sign of affection. Encoded in her first name were the tensions of affection and exploitation. Her surname literally means &quot;bearded man&quot; in Dutch. It also means uncivilized, uncouth, barbarous, savage. Saartjie Baartman – the savage servant.

Dutch colonisers also bestowed the term &quot;Hottentot&quot;, which is derived from &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;tot&quot;, Dutch approximations of common sounds in the Khoekhoe language. The Dutch used this word when referencing Khoekhoe people because of the clicking sounds and staccato pronunciations that characterise the Khoekhoe language; these components of the Khoekhoe language were considered strange and &quot;bestial&quot; to Dutch colonisers. The term was used until the late 20th century, at which point most people understood its effect as a derogatory term.

Travelogues that circulated in Europe would describe Africa as being &quot;uncivilised&quot; and lacking regard for religious virtue. Travelogues and imagery depicting Black women as &quot;sexually primitive&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; enforced the belief that it was in Africa&#x27;s best interest to be colonised by European settlers. Cultural and religious conversion was considered to be an altruistic act with imperialist undertones; colonisers believed that they were reforming and correcting Khoekhoe culture in the name of Christianity and the empire. Scholarly arguments discuss how Baartman&#x27;s body became a symbolic depiction of &quot;all African women&quot; as &quot;fierce, savage, naked, and untamable&quot; and became a crucial role in colonising parts of Africa and shaping narratives.

During the lengthy negotiation to have Baartman&#x27;s body returned to her home country after her death, the assistant curator of the Musée de l&#x27;Homme, Philippe Mennecier, argued against her return, stating: &quot;We never know what science will be able to tell us in the future. If she is buried, this chance will be lost ... for us she remains a very important treasure.&quot; According to Sadiah Qureshi, due to the continued treatment of Baartman&#x27;s body as a cultural artifact, Philippe Mennecier&#x27;s statement is contemporary evidence of the same type of ideology that surrounded Baartman&#x27;s body while she was alive in the 18th century.

==Feminist reception==

===Traditional iconography of Sarah Baartman and feminist contemporary art===
Many African female diasporic artists have criticised the traditional iconography of Baartman. According to the studies of contemporary feminists, traditional iconography and historical illustrations of Baartman are effective in revealing the ideological representation of black women in art throughout history. Such studies assess how the traditional iconography of the black female body was institutionally and scientifically defined in the 19th century.

Renee Cox, Renée Green, Joyce Scott, Lorna Simpson, Carrie Mae Weems and Deborah Willis are artists who seek to investigate contemporary social and cultural issues that still surround the African female body. Sander Gilman, a cultural and literary historian states: &quot;While many groups of African Blacks were known to Europeans in the 19th century, the Hottentot remained representative of the essence of the Black, especially the Black female. Both concepts fulfilled the iconographic function in the perception and representation of the world.&quot;
His article &quot;Black Bodies, White Bodies: Toward an Iconography of Female Sexuality in the Late Nineteenth Century Art, Medicine and Literature&quot; traces art historical records of black women in European art, and also proves that the association of black women with concupiscence within art history has been illustrated consistently since the beginning of the Middle Ages.

Lyle Ashton Harris and Renee Valerie Cox worked in collaboration to produce the photographic piece Hottentot Venus 2000. In this piece, Harris photographs Victoria Cox who presents herself as Baartman while wearing large, sculptural, gilded metal breasts and buttocks attached to her body.

&quot;Permitted&quot; is an installation piece created by Renée Green inspired by Sarah Baartman. Green created a specific viewing arrangement to investigate the European perception of the black female body as &quot;exotic&quot;, &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;monstrous&quot;. Viewers were prompted to step onto the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the basic setting of Baartman&#x27;s exhibition. At the centre of the platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman&#x27;s buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of the peephole, demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the 19th century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartman&#x27;s exhibit.

In her film &quot;Reassemblage: From the firelight to the screen&quot;, Trinh T. Minh-ha comments on the ethnocentric bias that the coloniser&#x27;s eye applies to the naked female form, arguing that this bias causes the nude female body to be seen as inherently sexually provocative, promiscuous and pornographic within the context of European or western culture.
Feminist artists are interested in re-representing Baartman&#x27;s image, and work to highlight the stereotypes and ethnocentric bias surrounding the black female body based on art historical representations and iconography that occurred before, after and during Baartman&#x27;s lifetime.

===Media representation and feminist criticism===
In November 2014, &quot;Paper Magazine&quot; released a cover of Kim Kardashian in which she was illustrated as balancing a champagne glass on her extended rear. The cover received much criticism for endorsing &quot;the exploitation and fetishism of the black female body&quot;. The similarities with the way in which Baartman was represented as the &quot;Hottentot Venus&quot; during the 19th century have prompted much criticism and commentary.

According to writer Geneva S. Thomas, anyone that is aware of black women&#x27;s history under colonialist influence would consequentially be aware that Kardashian&#x27;s photo easily elicits memory regarding the visual representation of Baartman.
The photographer and director of the photo, Jean-Paul Goude, based the photo on his previous work &quot;Carolina Beaumont&quot;, taken of a nude model in 1976 and published in his book &quot;Jungle Fever&quot;.

A &quot;People Magazine&quot; article in 1979 about his relationship with model Grace Jones describes Goude in the following statement:

Jean-Paul has been fascinated with women like Grace since his youth. The son of a French engineer and an American-born dancer, he grew up in a Paris suburb. From the moment he saw West Side Story and the Alvin Ailey dance troupe, he found himself captivated by &quot;ethnic minorities&quot; — black girls, PRs. &quot;I had jungle fever.&quot; He now says, &quot;Blacks are the premise of my work.&quot;

Days before the shoot, Goude often worked with his models to find the best &quot;hyperbolised&quot; position to take his photos. His model and partner, Grace Jones, would also pose for days prior to finally acquiring the perfect form. &quot;That&#x27;s the basis of my entire work,&quot; Goude states, &quot;creating a credible illusion.&quot; Similarly, Baartman and other black female slaves were illustrated and depicted in a specific form to identify features, which were seen as proof of ideologies regarding black female primitivism.

The professional background of Goude and the specific posture and presentation of Kardashian&#x27;s image in the recreation on the cover of &quot;Paper Magazine&quot; has caused feminist critics to comment how the objectification of the Baartman&#x27;s body and the ethnographic representation of her image in 19th-century society presents a comparable and complementary parallel to how Kardashian is currently represented in the media.

In response to the November 2014 photograph of Kim Kardashian, Cleuci de Oliveira published an article on Jezebel titled &quot;Saartjie Baartman: The Original Bootie Queen&quot;, which claims that Baartman was &quot;always an agent in her own path.&quot; Oliveira goes on to assert that Baartman performed on her own terms and was unwilling to view herself as a tool for scientific advancement, an object of entertainment, or a pawn of the state.

Neelika Jayawardane, a literature professor and editor of the website Africa is a Country, published a response to Oliveira&#x27;s article. Jayawardane criticises de Oliveira&#x27;s work, stating that she &quot;did untold damage to what the historical record shows about Baartman&quot;. Jayawardane&#x27;s article is cautious about introducing what she considers false agency to historical figures such as Baartman.

An article entitled &quot;Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Work of Six African Women Artists&quot;, curated by Cameroonian-born Koyo Kouoh, mentions Baartman&#x27;s legacy and its impact on young female African artists. The work linked to Baartman is meant to reference the ethnographic exhibits of the 19th century that enslaved Baartman and displayed her naked body. Artist Valérie Oka&#x27;s (&quot;Untitled&quot;, 2015) rendered a live performance of a black naked woman in a cage with the door swung open, walking around a sculpture of male genitalia, repeatedly. Her work was so impactful it led one audience member to proclaim, &quot;Do we allow this to happen because we are in the white cube, or are we revolted by it?&quot;. Oka&#x27;s work has been described as &#x27;black feminist art&#x27; where the female body is a site for activism and expression. The article also mentions other African female icons and how artists are expressing themselves through performance and discussion by posing the question &quot;How Does the White Man Represent the Black Woman?&quot;.

Social scientists James McKay and Helen Johnson cited Baartman to fit newspaper coverage of the African-American tennis players Venus and Serena Williams within racist trans-historical narratives of &quot;pornographic eroticism&quot; and &quot;sexual grotesquerie.&quot; According to McKay and Johnson, white male reporters covering the Williams sisters have fixated upon their on-court fashions and their muscular bodies, while downplaying their on-court achievements, describing their bodies as mannish, animalistic, or hyper-sexual, rather than well-developed. Their victories have been attributed to their supposed natural physical superiorities, while their defeats have been blamed on their supposed lack of discipline. This analysis claims that commentary on the size of Serena&#x27;s breasts and bottom, in particular, mirrors the spectacle made of Baartman&#x27;s body.

Heather Radke&#x27;s 2022 &quot;&quot; heavily relied on Baartman&#x27;s story to examine the cultural history of women&#x27;s buttocks.

===Reclaiming the story===
In recent years, some black women have found her story to be a source of empowerment, one that protests the ideals of white mainstream beauty, as curvaceous bodies are increasingly lauded in popular culture and mass media.

Paramount Chief Glen Taaibosch, chair of the Gauteng Khoi and San Council, says that today &quot;we call her our Hottentot Queen&quot; and honour her.

<text>Black Hand () was a type of Italian extortion racket. Originally developed in the eighteenth century, Black Hand extortion was exported to the United States in the later nineteenth century with Italian immigrants.

Black Hand was a method of extortion practiced by Italian immigrant gangsters of the Camorra and the Mafia, especially in the United States in Italian-American ghettos or neighborhoods. American newspapers in the first half of the twentieth century sometimes made reference to an organized &quot;Black Hand Society&quot;, a criminal enterprise composed of Italians, mainly Neapolitan and Sicilian immigrants. However, many Sicilians disputed its existence and objected to the associated negative ethnic stereotype, but this was not the only viewpoint among Italian-Americans. &quot;Il Telegrafo: The Evening Telegraph&quot;, a newspaper for the Italian American community in New York City, printed an editorial on 13 March 1909 in response to Joseph Petrosino&#x27;s assassination, which read in part, &quot;The assassination of Petrosino is an evil day for the Italians of America, and none of us can any longer deny that there is a Black Hand Society in the United States.&quot;

==Origin==
The roots of the Black Hand can be traced to the Kingdom of Naples as early as the 1750s. The English language term typically refers to the organization established by Italian immigrants in the United States during the 1850s and 60s. Some of the immigrants formed criminal syndicates, living alongside each other and largely victimizing fellow immigrants.

The first use of the term &quot;Black Hand&quot; to describe Italian-on-Italian crime in the United States was in a 1903 Brooklyn, NY extortion case. &quot;Black Hand&quot; continued to be the preferred terminology in American newspapers to describe unsolved crimes involving the Italian community until the early 1920s.

In 1907, a Black Hand headquarters was discovered in Hillsville, Pennsylvania, a village located a few miles west of New Castle, Pennsylvania. The Black Hand in Hillsville established a school to train members in the use of the stiletto. Another Black Hand headquarters was later discovered in Boston, Massachusetts. This headquarters, managed by Antonio Mirabito, allegedly operated from New England to as far south as New York City. Police were hopeful that Mirabito&#x27;s arrest would assist in ending the practice of Black Hand, but it continued in the area for about another decade. More successful immigrants were usually targeted, although as many as 90% of Italian immigrants and workmen in New York and other communities were threatened with extortion.

Typical Black Hand tactics involved sending a letter to a victim threatening bodily harm, kidnapping, arson, or murder. The letter demanded a specified amount of money to be delivered to a specific place. It was decorated with threatening symbols such as a smoking gun, hangman&#x27;s noose, skull, or knife dripping with blood or piercing a human heart, and was frequently signed with a hand, &quot;held up in the universal gesture of warning&quot;, imprinted or drawn in thick black ink.

Author Mike Dash states &quot;it was this last feature that inspired a journalist writing for &quot;The New York Herald&quot; to refer to the communications as &#x27;Black Hand&#x27; letters a name that stuck, and indeed, soon became synonymous with crime in Little Italy.&quot; The term &quot;Black Hand&quot; was readily adopted by the American press and generalized to the idea of an organized criminal conspiracy, which came to be known as &quot;The Black Hand Society.&quot;

Tenor Enrico Caruso received a Black Hand letter on which were drawn a black hand and dagger, demanding $2,000. He decided to pay, &quot;and, when this fact became public knowledge, was rewarded for his capitulation with &#x27;a stack of threatening letters a foot high,&#x27; including another from the same gang for $15,000.&quot; He reported the incident to the police who arranged for him to drop off the money at a prearranged spot, then arrested two Italian businessmen who retrieved the money.

On occasion, criminals used violence against law enforcement officials who battled Black Hand schemes. Victims of assassinations linked to Black Hand operations include New Orleans Police Department chief David Hennessy and New York Police Department lieutenant Joseph Petrosino.

<text>Bridey Murphy (December 20, 1798-1864) is a purported 19th-century Irishwoman whom U.S. housewife Virginia Tighe (April 27, 1923 – July 12, 1995) claimed to be in a past life. The case was investigated by researchers and determined to be the result of cryptomnesia.

==Hypnotic regression==
In 1952, Colorado businessman and amateur hypnotist Morey Bernstein (1919–1999) put housewife Virginia Tighe of Pueblo, Colorado, in a trance that elicited revelations about Tighe&#x27;s alleged past life as a 19th-century Irishwoman. Bernstein used a technique called hypnotic regression, during which the subject is gradually taken back to childhood. He then attempted to take Virginia one step further, before birth (so-called &quot;past life regression&quot;), and was astonished to find he was listening to Bridey Murphy.

Tighe&#x27;s tale began in 1806, when Bridey was eight years old and living in a house in Cork. She was the daughter of Duncan Murphy, a barrister, and his wife Kathleen. At the age of 17 ( 1815), she married barrister Sean Brian McCarthy, who she claimed taught at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, to which she moved. Tighe told of a fall that caused Bridey&#x27;s death c. 1864, and of watching her own funeral, describing her tombstone and the state of being in life after death. It was, she recalled, a feeling of neither pain nor happiness. 

Somehow, she was reborn in America 59 years later, although Tighe/Bridey was not clear how this event happened. Tighe herself was born as Virginia Mae Reese in the Midwest in 1923, had never been to Ireland, and did not speak with even the slightest hint of an Irish accent. Murphy, however, spoke with a heavy brogue and used Irish expressions (some of which were not actually used in the 19th century).

==Book publication and response==

The story of Bridey Murphy was first told in a series of articles by William J. Barker, published in the &quot;Denver Post&quot; in 1954. In early 1956, Doubleday released a book by Bernstein, &quot;The Search for Bridey Murphy&quot;. Film rights had already been sold by the time of its publication (see below). At her insistence, Tighe was given the pseudonym &quot;Ruth Mills Simmons&quot;.

===The Bridey Murphy craze===
The best-selling book created a sensation; people would throw Bridey Murphy-themed &quot;come as you were&quot; parties and dances, and jokes abounded, such as cartoons of parents greeting newborns with &quot;welcome back!&quot;

Popular songs of the time included &quot;The Ballad of Bridey Murphy&quot; by Fran Allison, &quot;The Love of Bridey Murphy&quot; by Billy Devroe&#x27;s Devilaires, and &quot;Do You Believe (In Reincarnation)&quot; by Lalo Guerrero. There was a &quot;Reincarnation cocktail&quot;.

Stan Freberg recorded a satirical sketch in 1956 titled &quot;The Quest For Bridey Hammerschlaugen&quot;, parodying the LP released of excerpts of the first hypnosis session. Freberg hypnotizes Goldie Smith (voiced by June Foray) to regress her to different eras, with humorous interruptions by Smith. At the end, Smith hypnotizes Freberg, who becomes Davy Crockett. When Smith mocks Freberg-as-Crockett for not being able to profit from the recent Davy Crockett craze, &quot;Crockett&quot; replies that in his next life, he &quot;may be Walt Disney.&quot;

The past-life themed 1956 film &quot;I&#x27;ve Lived Before&quot; is said to have been inspired by the craze.

===Research challenging the story===
The biographical details related by Bridey were not rigorously checked before the book&#x27;s publication. However, once the book had become a bestseller, almost every detail was thoroughly checked by reporters who were sent to Ireland to track down the background of the elusive woman. It was then that the first doubts about her &quot;reincarnation&quot; began to appear.
Bridey said she was born on December 20, 1798, in Cork and that she had died in 1864. No record was found of either event. Also, no evidence could be found of a wooden house called The Meadows, in which Bridey said she had lived, just of a place of that name near Cork. Additionally, during the 19th century, most houses in Ireland were made of brick or stone. Bridey pronounced her husband&#x27;s name as &quot;See-an&quot;, although Seán is typically pronounced &quot;Shawn&quot;, especially in Ireland. Queen&#x27;s University Belfast did not exist at the time Bridey claimed her husband was working there. Brian, which is what Bridey preferred to call her husband, was also the middle name of the man to whom Virginia Tighe was married. Tighe claimed Bridey went to a St. Theresa&#x27;s Church, which did indeed exist, but it was not built until 1911, long after Bridey was said to have died.

Some of the details provided by Tighe proved to be more plausible. For example, her descriptions of the Antrim coastline were very accurate, as was her account of a journey from Belfast to Cork. She recounted that the young Bridey shopped for provisions with a grocer named Farr; it was discovered that such a grocer had existed, although this may simply have been a coincidence.

Some researchers came to the conclusion that the best way to discover the truth was to check back not to Ireland, but rather to Tighe&#x27;s own childhood and her relationship with her parents. Morey Bernstein stated that Tighe/Simmons was brought up by a Norwegian uncle and his German-Scottish-Irish wife. However, he did not mention that her birth parents were both partly Irish, and that she had lived with them until the age of three. He also did not mention that an Irish immigrant named Bridie Murphy Corkell (1892–1957) lived across the street from Tighe&#x27;s childhood home in Chicago, Illinois. Bridie emigrated to the U.S. in 1908. Although Tighe claimed that she did not know Mrs. Corkell&#x27;s maiden name, Bridie&#x27;s spinster sister Margaret Murphy was living with the Corkells in the 1930 census. Researchers noted that many of the elements Virginia Tighe described in Bridey&#x27;s life corresponded to ones in her own childhood. Similarly, Tighe had used an Irish brogue in theatrical plays as a teenager. Cryptomnesia has been frequently mentioned as an explanation for Tighe&#x27;s memories. Because of correlations with Tighe&#x27;s past life and discrepancies with the Ireland of the Bridey Murphy story&#x27;s time, writers such as Michael Shermer consider any paranormal interpretation of the case to be &quot;thoroughly disproven&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

&quot;The Search for Bridey Murphy&quot; was made into a 1956 film of the same name. Produced by Paramount, the film starred Teresa Wright (as Ruth Simmons), Louis Hayward, and Nancy Gates. It was directed by Noel Langley.

==Later events==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;, in Bernstein&#x27;s obituary, characterized the eventual feelings held by supporters of the story:
Virginia Tighe disliked being in the spotlight and was skeptical about reincarnation, although in later years she would add, &quot;The older I get the more I want to believe.&quot; She died in Denver in 1995 (as &quot;The New York Times&quot; later put it, &quot;perhaps for the second time&quot;). Bernstein gave up hypnotism after Bridey Murphy and began working in business. Success followed, and he became a prominent local philanthropist. He died in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1999.

== Pop culture references ==
In the Carl Barks-produced Scrooge McDuck comic book story &quot;Back to Long Ago!&quot; (1956), Scrooge and Donald Duck get hypnotized to find out about their past lives, learning of their existence as sailors Malcolm McDuck and Pintail Duck in a frigate of the English Navy in 1564. Scrooge&#x27;s hired hypnotist, &quot;Prof. Mesmer J. Spellcaster, H. P., D. H.,&quot; has a row of books on his office shelf that includes &quot;Quest for Tidie Brophy&quot;, &quot;Search for Lydie Burfee&quot;, &quot;Paging Gracie Macie&quot;, and &quot;The Search for Murphy&#x27;s Bridie&quot;.

In Robert Wise&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Haunting&quot;, Julie Harris&#x27;s character is jokingly accused of being a reincarnation of Bridey Murphy by Russ Tamblyn&#x27;s character.

In Thomas Pynchon’s &quot;V.&quot; (1963), a character is mentioned as reading &quot;The Search for Bridey Murphy&quot;, described as a book written by a Colorado businessman to tell people there was life after death.

In the &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; episode &quot;Extra! Extra! Sensory Perception&quot; (1964), &quot;The Search for Murphy&#x27;s Bridie&quot; is mentioned when Mrs Brown is accidentally regressed.

Bridey Murphy, a band consisting of Bill, Paul, and Barry Cowsill, and Waddy Wachtel, released a single in 1974, &quot;The Time Has Come.&quot;

In the movie &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), Peggy&#x27;s grandfather mentions reading a book about a woman in Colorado who claimed to have lived 159 years ago in Ireland.

In Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s novel &quot;Tell Me Your Dreams&quot; (1998), Bridey Murphy is referenced after a hypnosis session is carried out on the main character.

In a December 9, 2024 appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, comedian Billy Crystal discussed the origin of his current TV series &quot;Before&quot; (2024), a past-life regression saga. The basic idea was his own, he said, and inspired by the &quot;true story&quot; of Bridey Murphy. (Colbert allowed as how he had never heard of Bridey Murphy.)

<text>The &quot;Catalpa&quot; rescue was the escape, on 17–19 April 1876, of six Irish Fenian prisoners from the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison), a British penal colony in Western Australia. They were taken on the convict ship &quot;Hougoumont&quot; to Fremantle, Western Australia, arriving 9 January 1868. In 1869, pardons had been issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians. Another round of pardons was issued in 1871, after which only a small group of &quot;military&quot; Fenians remained in Western Australia&#x27;s penal system.

In 1874, prisoner James Wilson secretly sent a letter to New York City journalist John Devoy, who worked to organize a rescue. Using donations collected by Devoy from Irish-Americans, Fremantle escapee John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly, then living in Boston, purchased a merchant ship, &quot;Catalpa&quot;, and sailed her to international waters off Rockingham, Western Australia. On 17 April 1876 at 8:30 am, Wilson and five other Fenians working outside the prison walls, Thomas Darragh, Martin Hogan, Michael Harrington, Thomas Hassett, and Robert Cranston, boarded a whaleboat O&#x27;Reilly had dispatched, were taken aboard &quot;Catalpa&quot;, and escaped to New York.

==Fenians and plans to escape==
From 1865 to 1867, British authorities rounded up supporters of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to the penal colony of Western Australia. They were convicted of crimes ranging from treason-felony to outright rebellion. Sixteen were soldiers who were court-martialled for failing to report or stop the treason and mutinous acts of the others. Among them was John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly, later to become the editor of the Boston newspaper &quot;The Pilot&quot;. They were sent on the convict ship &quot;Hougoumont&quot;, arriving at Fremantle on 9 January 1868, at the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison).

In 1869, O&#x27;Reilly escaped on the whaling ship &quot;Gazelle&quot; in Bunbury with assistance of the local Catholic priest, Father Patrick McCabe, and settled in Boston. Soon after his arrival, O&#x27;Reilly found work with &quot;The Pilot&quot; newspaper and eventually became editor. In 1871, another Fenian, John Devoy, was granted amnesty in England on condition that he settle outside Ireland. He sailed to New York City and became a newspaperman for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. He joined the Clan na Gael, an organization that supported armed insurrection in Ireland.

In 1869, pardons had been issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians. Another round of pardons were issued in 1871, after which only a small group of &quot;military&quot; Fenians remained in Western Australia&#x27;s penal system. In 1874, Devoy received a smuggled letter from imprisoned Fenian James Wilson, who was among those the British had not released.

Dear Friend, remember this is a voice from the tomb. For is not this a living tomb? In the tomb it is only a man&#x27;s body that is good for worms, but in the living tomb the canker worm of care enters the very soul. Think that we have been nearly nine years in this living tomb since our first arrest and that it is impossible for mind or body to withstand the continual strain that is upon them. One or the other must give way. It is in this sad strait that I now, in the name of my comrades and myself, ask you to aid us in the manner pointed out... We ask you to aid us with your tongue and pen, with your brain and intellect, with your ability and influence, and God will bless your efforts, and we will repay you with all the gratitude of our natures... our faith in you is unbound. We think if you forsake us, then we are friendless indeed. —James Wilson

Devoy discussed the matter with O&#x27;Reilly and Thomas McCarthy Fennell, and Fennell suggested that a ship be purchased, laden with a legitimate cargo, and sailed to Western Australia, where it would not be expected to arouse suspicion. The Fenian prisoners would then be rescued by stealth rather than force of arms. Devoy approached the 1874 convention of the Clan na Gael and got the Clan to agree to fund a rescue of the men. He then approached whaling agent John T. Richardson, who told them to contact his son-in-law, whaling captain George Smith Anthony, who agreed to help.

==&quot;Catalpa&quot;==

In 1875, the Clan&#x27;s committee purchased (in the name of their member James Reynolds) three-masted merchant bark &quot;Catalpa&quot; for $5,500 ($ in dollars). She measured 202.05 tons and was 90 feet long, 25 feet in breadth and 12.2 feet deep. She had earlier been a whaleship, sailing out of New Bedford, but had been converted to merchant service with an open hold. Under Captain Anthony&#x27;s direction, &quot;Catalpa&quot; was carefully restored to the fitting and rigging of a whaleship &quot;ostensibly for a voyage of eighteen months or two years in the North and South Atlantic&quot;. Anthony&#x27;s recruited crew of twenty-three included a highly qualified first mate, Samuel P. Smith, and a representative of the conspirators, Dennis Duggan, who shipped as a carpenter. The remainder were mostly Kanakas, Malays and Africans, some with invented names.

===Departure and voyage===
On 29 April 1875, &quot;Catalpa&quot; sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts. At first, most of the crew was unaware of their real mission. Anthony noticed too late that the ship&#x27;s marine chronometer was broken, so he had to rely on his personal skills for navigation. They hunted whales in the Atlantic for five months before sailing to Fayal Island in the Azores, where they offloaded 210 barrels of sperm whale oil in late October. Unfortunately, much of the crew deserted the ship and they also had to leave behind three sick men. Anthony recruited replacement crew members and set sail for Western Australia on 6 November.

==Undercover operatives==
To manage the &quot;land end&quot; of the rescue operation, John Devoy signed up Fenian agents John J. Breslin and Thomas Desmond to go to Western Australia. Breslin masqueraded as American businessman &quot;James Collins&quot;, with suitable letter of introduction, while Desmond adopted the alias of Johnson. They departed the US in September 1875 and arrived in Fremantle in November 1875, after which &quot;they separated and became ostensible strangers.&quot; Coincidentally, the Irish Republican Brotherhood had sent two of their own agents (Denis Florence MacCarthy This Denis Florence MacCarthy is not the Denis Florence McCarthy who was dispatched to Western Australia. The correct person was born May 27, 1844 in Kenmare and died in Chicago Nov 10, 1909 
and John Walsh) to organise an escape attempt, and a local Fenian named John King was working on his own plan. John Breslin was able to bring all three plans together. Breslin, as Collins, lodged in the Emerald Isle Hotel in Fremantle, while Thomas Desmond took a job as a wheelwright and recruited five local Irishmen who were to cut the telegraph lines connecting Perth to Albany on the day of escape (there was no link to the eastern colonies of Australia until 1877). Breslin became acquainted with Sir William Cleaver Robinson, the Governor of Western Australia. Robinson took Breslin on a tour of the Convict Establishment (now Fremantle Prison) where he secretly informed the prisoners that an escape was due. While staying at the hotel, Breslin engaged in a love affair with 22-year-old chamber maid, Mary Tondut. She became pregnant and Anthony paid for her to go to Sydney but never saw her again. In December 1876, Tondut gave birth to Breslin&#x27;s only child, John Joseph Tondut.

===Rescue preparations===
&quot;Catalpa&quot; fell behind the intended schedule owing to weather conditions. After 11 months at sea, she dropped anchor off Bunbury on 28 March 1876. Anthony and Breslin met and began to prepare for the rescue.

While in Bunbury, Breslin (a.k.a. Collins) stayed in Spencer&#x27;s Hotel (operated by William Spencer). Anthony and Breslin briefly travelled back together to Fremantle on on 1 April, arriving the next day and were horrified to find the Royal Navy gunboat HMS &quot;Conflict&quot; in port, necessitating postponement of their plan. Breslin and Anthony travelled to the intended escape departure point in Rockingham. A couple of days later, Anthony and Breslin were invited to a party at the governor&#x27;s residence. Anthony returned to Bunbury via mail coach on 6 April and discovered that the crew had stowed away another ticket-of-leave convict. Anthony informed the authorities and they took the man ashore. Anthony departed for Rockingham on 15 April.
The escape had been planned for 6 April, but the appearance of HMS &quot;Conflict&quot; and other Royal Navy ships and customs officers led to a postponement. The escape was rearranged for 17 April, when most of the Convict Establishment garrison was watching the Perth Yacht Club regatta.

==Escape and pursuit==
&quot;Catalpa&quot; dropped anchor in international waters off Rockingham and dispatched a whaleboat to shore. At 8:30 am, six Fenians who were working in work parties outside the prison walls, absconded—Thomas Darragh, Martin Hogan, Michael Harrington, Thomas Hassett, Robert Cranston and James Wilson. They were met by Breslin and Desmond and picked up in horse traps. According to Anthony, a seventh Fenian, James Kiely, was intentionally left behind because during his trial he had offered to divulge the names of comrades in an effort to obtain a reduced sentence for himself. Kiely, however, claimed that he was unable to get away from his guard. He was released on licence in 1878 and pardoned in 1905. The men raced south to Rockingham pier where Anthony awaited them with the whaleboat. A local named James Bell he had spoken to earlier saw the men and quickly alerted the authorities.

As they rowed to &quot;Catalpa&quot;, a fierce squall struck, breaking the whaleboat&#x27;s mast. The storm lasted till dawn on 18 April and was so intense that Anthony later stated that he did not expect the small boat to survive. At 7 am, with the storm over, they again made for &quot;Catalpa&quot; but an hour later spotted the screw steamer &quot;Georgette&quot;, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor, making for the whaler. The men lay down in the whaleboat and it was not seen by &quot;Georgette&quot;. &quot;Georgette&quot; found &quot;Catalpa&quot; but, in Captain Anthony&#x27;s absence, the first mate refused to allow the colonial police to board as the ship was outside the colony&#x27;s three-mile limit. The steamer was forced to return to Fremantle for coal after following the &quot;Catalpa&quot; for several hours.

As the whaleboat again made for the ship, a police cutter with 30 to 40 armed men was spotted. The two boats raced to reach the &quot;Catalpa&quot; first, with the whaleboat winning, and the men climbing aboard as the police cutter passed by. The cutter turned, lingered briefly beside &quot;Catalpa&quot;, and then headed to shore.

===Saved by the US flag===
Early on 19 April the refuelled and now armed &quot;Georgette&quot; returned and came alongside the whaler, demanding the surrender of the prisoners and attempting to herd the ship back into Australian waters. They fired a warning shot with a 12-pounder (5 kg) cannon that had been installed the night before. Ignoring the demand to surrender, Anthony hoisted and pointed towards the U.S. flag, warning that an attack on &quot;Catalpa&quot; would be considered an act of war against the U.S., and proceeded westward. This was well recognised by Captain O&#x27;Grady of &quot;Georgette&quot;, who had sailed out of New York, was friendly toward Anthony and had, on 1 April, unwittingly entertained him in the steamer&#x27;s pilot house, closely briefing him on the coast between Fremantle and Rockingham.

Governor Robinson had ordered the police on &quot;Georgette&quot; not to create an incident outside territorial waters. After steaming around threateningly for about an hour, &quot;Georgette&quot; headed back to Fremantle and &quot;Catalpa&quot; slipped away into the Indian Ocean.

== Aftermath ==

&quot;Catalpa&quot; did her best to avoid Royal Navy ships on her way back to the U.S. O&#x27;Reilly received the news of the escape on 6 June and released the news to the press. The news sparked celebrations in the United States and Ireland and anger in Britain and Australia (although there was also sympathy for the cause within the Australian population). &quot;Catalpa&quot; returned to New York on 19 August 1876. On the other hand, it did not cause any diplomatic issues between the U.S. and the U.K., and the governor of Western Australia was glad to that the Fenians had &quot;become the problem of some other nation&quot;.

On 1 December 1876, seven months after the escape, &quot;Georgette&quot; sank near Busselton.

George Smith Anthony remained in New Bedford with his wife and children, never returning to sea. He was appointed New Bedford Port Inspector in 1886. With the help of a journalist, Z. W. Pease, he published an account of his journey, &quot;&quot;, in 1897. He died in 1913.

Thomas Desmond went on to become Sheriff of San Francisco from 1880 to 1881

John Breslin returned as a hero. He continued contact with the Clan na Gael and Devoy, and died in 1887.

&quot;Catalpa&quot; was presented to Captain Anthony, John Richardson and Henry Hathaway in lieu of payment. She was eventually sold and turned into a coal barge. Not of great value in this capacity, &quot;Catalpa&quot; was finally condemned at the port of Belize, British Honduras.

===Mythologising===
The story of &quot;Catalpa&quot; escape grew more dramatic in each retelling. After the first mate declined to allow the police to board the ship, he wrote in the ship&#x27;s log:
At 8 Am the Steam Ship &quot;Georgette&quot; hailed me and her captian asked me if I had seen a boat with a lot of men in it—I told him no. Another man asked me if the Captian was on board—I told him no. Asked if I had any strangers on board—I told him no. Then asked if he might come on board—I told him no. The steamer then left me and I stood on my course.

In the version of the tale told by Anthony (who was not a witness), it became:
The captain of the English steamer asked where the boat was which was missing from the cranes... &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about it,&quot; said Mr. Smith. &quot;Can I come aboard?&quot; asked the officer. &quot;Not by a damned sight,&quot; was Mr. Smith&#x27;s reply.

In &quot;The Emerald Whaler&quot; (1960) by William Laubenstein, a fictionalised version, the encounter became much more confrontational:
This is Her Majesty&#x27;s ship of war &quot;Georgette&quot;... &quot;Hell of a lookin&#x27; warship,&quot; Sam jibed. &quot;What&#x27;s yer guns?&quot; ... &quot;What is your business?&quot; ... &quot;I&#x27;m on th&#x27; high seas, as any fool can see,&quot; Sam countered ... &quot;Your larboard boat is missing&quot; ... &quot;Captain has it&quot; ... &quot;I am going to board your ship!&quot; ... &quot;Like hell you are! You try it an&#x27; you&#x27;ll be goddamned good and sorry! ... What the hell did we lick the pants offn&#x27; you damn Britishers in 1812 about? ... You don&#x27;t own the goddamn ocean!&quot;

In addition, over the years, &quot;Georgette&quot; was presented as bigger and larger than it actually was: roughly the same size as &quot;Catalpa&quot;, and outfitted with a single cannon. In Thomas Keneally&#x27;s &quot;The Great Shame and the Triumph of the Irish in the English-Speaking World&quot; (1999), she is described as the Royal Navy&#x27;s newest ship, twice the size of &quot;Catalpa&quot;.

===Memorials===

On 9 September 2005 a memorial was unveiled in Rockingham to commemorate the escape. The memorial, a large statue of six wild geese, was created by Western Australian artists Charlie Smith and Joan Walsh Smith. The geese refer to the phrase &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; which was a name given to Irish soldiers who served in European armies after being exiled from Ireland. The Fenians transported to Western Australia adopted the phrase for themselves during their voyage on board &quot;Hougoumont&quot;, even publishing a shipboard newspaper entitled &quot;The Wild Goose&quot;.

In 1976 a memorial stone was erected in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the rescue. New Bedford was the home port of &quot;Catalpa&quot;.

===Exhibition===

From 22 September 2006 to 3 December 2006 an exhibition, called &quot;Escape: Fremantle to Freedom,&quot; opened at Fremantle Prison displaying many artefacts relating to the &quot;Catalpa&quot; rescue. The exhibition received over 20,000 visitors.

<text>Andreas Hofer (22 November 1767 – 20 February 1810) was a Tyrolean innkeeper and drover, who in 1809 became the leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion against the Napoleonic and Bavarian invasion, and against compulsory smallpox vaccination, during the War of the Fifth Coalition. He was subsequently captured and executed.

Hofer is still today venerated as a folk hero, freedom fighter and Austrian patriot. His great-grandson Andreas Hofer was a member of the very important resistance group against Nazi Germany around the priest Heinrich Maier.

==Life==

Andreas Hofer was born 1767 in St. Leonhard in Passeier, in the Habsburg crown land of Tyrol. His father was an innkeeper of the &quot;Sandhof&quot; inn and Andreas followed in his footsteps when he inherited the establishment. He also traded wine and horses in adjacent Northern Italy and learned the Italian language. He married Anna Ladurner. In 1791 he was elected to the Tyrolean Landtag assembly. In German he was known as a &quot;Wirt&quot; (innkeeper) and thus ever after &quot;Sandwirt&quot;.

In the War of the Third Coalition against the French he became a sharpshooter and later a militia captain in the Austrian Imperial and Royal Army. After the Austrian defeat, Tyrol was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria (France&#x27;s ally) according to the 1805 Treaty of Pressburg. During the stern measures of Minister Maximilian von Montgelas and the forced recruitment into the Bavarian Army, Hofer became a leader of the anti-Bavarian movement. In January 1809, he was part of a delegation to Vienna to ask Emperor Francis I of Austria for support for a possible uprising. The Emperor gave his assurances and the delegation returned home.

Hofer begun to secretly organize insurrection, visiting villagers and holding councils of war in local inns. Reputedly he was so much on the move that he signed his messages &quot;Andreas Hofer, from where I am&quot; and letters to him were addressed to &quot;wherever he may be&quot;. At the same time other leaders organized their own forces elsewhere in the Alps. Hofer became a leader of a militia contingent in the Passeier Valley.

===Armed rebellion begins===

The Tyrolean Rebellion began on 9 April 1809 in Innsbruck. The previous night, organizers dumped sacks of sawdust into the River Inn as a sign to start the rebellion; floating through the town and down the Inn Valley, it alerted the rebels. Church bells summoned men to fight with muskets and farmyard implements. They soon overran smaller Bavarian garrisons and surprised a column of French infantry that was passing through the area.

On 11 April Tyrolean militia defeated a Bavarian force in Sterzing which led to the occupation of Innsbruck before noon. Though French forces came across the Brenner Pass as a relief and a united French-Bavarian contingent counterattacked the next night, the Tyroleans fought them in the First Battle of Bergisel until Hofer and his allies won on the morning of the 13th. While Austrian forces under General Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles moved into the Tyrolean capital and installed a provisional government led by Joseph Hormayr, Hofer advanced south, taking Bozen and Trent.

Hopes of a successful rebellion waned when Napoleon defeated the Austrian forces of Archduke Charles of Austria in a series of battles of Teugen-Hausen, Abensberg, Eckmühl, and Ratisbon, whereafter the Austrian troops withdrew from Tyrol and Hofer had to pull back to the mountains. The French Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre took charge of the Tyrolean theatre, and Bavarian and Saxon forces under the command of Karl Philipp von Wrede on 13 May defeated the Austrians in a bloody skirmish at Wörgl. The Bavarians re-occupied Innsbruck on 19 May. However, when their French allies left, the rebellion flared up again.

===Hofer takes command===

Hofer became the effective commander-in-chief of the Tyrolean rebels, with the support of other leaders such as Josef Speckbacher and Father Joachim Haspinger. He commanded a force of Tyroleans approximately 20,000 strong, together with a couple of hundred Austrian soldiers who had joined them after the retreat of the Austrian army.

In the second Battle of Bergisel, from 25 to 29 May 1809, Hofer&#x27;s troops again defeated the Bavarians, driving them out of the country and retaking Innsbruck on 30 May. On 29 May Hofer received a letter from Emperor Francis in which he promised not to sign any peace treaty that would include giving up Tyrol. An Austrian intendant came to rule Tyrol and Hofer returned to his home. However, Napoleon again defeated Austrian troops in the Battle of Wagram on 6 July. The Armistice of Znaim ceded Tyrol to Bavaria again. Napoleon sent 40,000 French and Bavarian troops to take over Tyrol and they re-occupied Innsbruck.

After little hesitation, Hofer joined battle again. The French offered a reward for his head. On 13–14 August, in the third Battle of Bergisel, Hofer&#x27;s Tyroleans defeated the French troops of Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre in a 12-hour battle after a downhill charge. The Tyroleans retook Innsbruck.
Hofer declared himself Imperial Commandant of the Tyrol in the absence of the ruler and for two months ruled the land from Hofburg in the name of the Emperor of Austria. He announced new laws and taxes and minted his own coins. He also sent two men to Britain to ask for assistance. On 29 September he received a medal from the emperor and another promise that Austria would not abandon Tyrol.

Hofer&#x27;s hopes were dashed on 14 October, when the Treaty of Schönbrunn again ceded Tyrol to Bavaria. French and Bavarian troops advanced and Hofer retreated to the mountains. Promised amnesty, Hofer and his followers laid down their weapons on 8 November. Hofer retired to his home valley.

===Final attempt and capture===

On 12 November Hofer received false reports of Austrian victories and tried to summon his troops on 15 November. This time he had little following and French troops defeated his forces. His subordinate commanders surrendered and urged him to escape over the mountains.

Hofer hid in a hut in the mountains in the Passeiertal and the French announced a reward of 1500 guilders for his head. His neighbor Franz Raffl betrayed him and revealed his hiding place to the authorities. Hofer was captured by Italian troops on 28 January 1810 and was sent to Mantua in chains to face a court-martial. Raffl died impoverished in Bavaria twenty years later.

===Court martial and execution===

Officers holding the court-martial disagreed on the exact sentence until they received a message from Milan. It was supposedly from Eugène de Beauharnais, transmitting Napoleon&#x27;s order to &quot;give him a fair trial and then shoot him&quot;. Napoleon later claimed to Klemens von Metternich that Hofer was executed against his wishes. Hofer was executed by a firing squad on 20 February 1810. He refused a blindfold or to kneel, and gave money to a corporal in charge, telling him to &quot;shoot straight&quot;. He gave the order to fire himself. Hofer became a martyr in Germany and Austria and a rallying symbol against the power of Napoleon.

==Legacy and monuments==

In 1809 William Wordsworth wrote some sonnets to Andreas Hofer which contributed to the romanticisation of his image and the legend surrounding the insurrection.

In 1818, his family was given a patent of nobility by the emperor of Austria (he and Anna had 7 children, at least two of whom emigrated to America). In 1823, Hofer&#x27;s remains were moved from Mantua to Innsbruck, and in 1834, his tomb was decorated with a marble statue. In 1893, a bronze statue of Hofer was erected in Bergisel (Innsbruck). A large painting depicting his arrest hangs in the Palace of Maria Theresa in Innsbruck, and there is an annual open-air play in Meran based on his life. In Meran there is also a monumental statue of him opposite the train station at the beginning of the Via Andreas Hofer, which was erected by Tyrolean nationalists in 1915. In New Glarus, Wisconsin there is a large mural of Hofer inside Puempel&#x27;s Olde Tavern.

The song &quot;Zu Mantua in Banden&quot; (today the anthem of the State of Tyrol) tells the story of his tragic fate and execution.
His most famous quote: &quot;I will not trade my life for a lie&quot;.

<text>Timothy Dexter (January 22, 1747 – October 23, 1806), self-styled Lord Timothy Dexter, was an American businessman noted for his eccentric behavior and writings. He became wealthy through marriage and a series of improbably successful investments and spent his fortune lavishly. Though barely educated or literate, Dexter considered himself &quot;the greatest philosopher in the known world&quot;, and authored a book, &quot;A Pickle for the Knowing Ones&quot;, which espouses his views on various topics and became notorious for its unusual misspellings and grammatical errors.

== Life and works ==

Dexter was born in Malden in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. He was from a poor family of Irish immigrants who had moved to the New World the century before. He had little schooling and dropped out of school to work as a farm laborer at the age of 8.

When he was 16, he became a tanner&#x27;s apprentice. In 1769, he moved to Newburyport, Massachusetts. He married 32-year-old Elizabeth Frothingham, a rich widow, and he then bought a mansion with the money. Dexter set up shop in the basement, selling moosehide trousers, gloves, hides, and whale blubber. Elizabeth also opened a shop that sold notions.

At the end of the American Revolutionary War, he purchased large amounts of depreciated Continental currency that were worthless at the time. At the war&#x27;s end, the U.S. government made good on its notes at one percent of face value, while Massachusetts paid its own notes at par. His investment enabled him to amass a considerable profit. He built two ships and began an export business to the West Indies and Europe.

To elevate his social status, Dexter began to write petitions supporting that he be considered for public office. It is thought that because of Dexter&#x27;s multiple petitions, Newburyport&#x27;s government decided that the best way to silence him was to give him the title of &quot;Informer of Deer,&quot; since there were no deer in Newburyport.

Because he was largely uneducated, his business sense was considered peculiar. He was advised to send bed warmers—used to heat beds in the cold New England winters—for resale in the West Indies, a tropical area. This advice was a deliberate ploy by rivals to bankrupt him. His ship&#x27;s captain sold them as ladles to the local molasses industry and made a handsome profit. Next, Dexter sent wool mittens to the same place, where Asian merchants bought them for export to Siberia.

People jokingly told him to &quot;ship coal to Newcastle&quot;. Fortuitously, he did so during a Newcastle miners&#x27; strike, and his cargo was sold at a premium. On another occasion, practical jokers told him he could make money by shipping gloves to the South Sea Islands. His ships arrived there in time to sell the gloves to Portuguese boats on their way to China.

He exported Bibles to the East Indies and stray cats to Caribbean islands and again made a profit; Eastern missionaries needed the Bibles and the Caribbean welcomed a solution to rat infestation. He also hoarded whalebones by mistake, but ended up selling them profitably as corset stays.

While subject to ridicule, Dexter&#x27;s boasting makes it clear that he understood the value of cornering the market on goods that others did not see as valuable and the utility of &quot;acting the fool&quot;.

New England high society snubbed him. Dexter bought a large house in Newburyport from Nathaniel Tracy, a local socialite, and tried to emulate Tracy&#x27;s prominent mansion. He decorated this house with minarets, a golden eagle on the top of the cupola, a mausoleum for himself, and a garden of 40 wooden statues of famous men, including George Washington, William Pitt, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Jefferson, and himself. The last had the inscription, &quot;I am the first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher in the Western World&quot;. Dexter also bought an estate in Chester, New Hampshire. There, Dexter recommended people to call him the Earl of Chester. He offered one quarter to children who called him Lord Chester, and dinner and drinks for adults who did so.

Despite his good fortune, his relationship with his family suffered. He frequently told visitors that his wife (who was actually alive) had died, and that the woman frequenting the building was simply her ghost. In one notable episode, Dexter faked his own death to see how people would react, and about 3,000 people attended Dexter&#x27;s mock wake. When Dexter did not see his wife cry, he revealed the hoax and promptly caned her for not sufficiently mourning his death.

== Writing ==
At age 50, Dexter authored the book &quot;A Pickle for the Knowing Ones&quot;, also known as &quot;Plain Truth in a Homespun Dress&quot;. in which he complained about politicians, the clergy, and his wife. The book contains 8,847 words and 33,864 letters, but without any punctuation and with unorthodox spelling and capitalization. Dexter also signs his name at the end of each chapter, as though they were letters. One section begins:


The first edition was self-published in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1802. Dexter initially distributed his book for free, but it became popular and was reprinted eight times. The second edition was printed in Newburyport in 1805. In the second edition, Dexter responded to complaints about the book&#x27;s lack of punctuation by adding an extra page of 11 lines of punctuation marks with the instruction that printers and readers could insert them wherever needed—or, in his words, &quot;thay may peper and solt it as they plese&quot;.

==Legacy==
Some of Dexter&#x27;s social contemporaries considered him very unintelligent; his obituary considered &quot;his intellectual endowments not being of the most exalted stamp&quot;. Dexter attempted to burnish his own legacy by enlisting the efforts of Jonathan Plummer, a fish merchant and amateur poet, who extolled his patron in verse: 

The Massachusetts Probate Office valued his estate at $35,027.39 (roughly ) at the time of Dexter&#x27;s death in 1806. After his death, Dexter&#x27;s Newburyport house had its household furniture, gilt balls, and much of the garden statuary auctioned off on 12 May 1807. The Great September Gale of 1815 toppled most of the remaining statues, and the survivors were sold at another auction; some ended up being burned for firewood.

Ultimately, fewer than six of the original 40 statues survived to the present day, being rediscovered during the Great Depression as a result of a Works Progress Administration survey; the most prominent one being that of William Pitt, restored by the Smithsonian Institution. It was loaned to the local Museum of Old Newbury in 1994, and its ownership was transferred to the local museum in January 2025. In 2013, a pair of carved figurines that once adorned the house&#x27;s entrance, titled &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Plenty&quot;, were put on auction by an Amesbury auction house, but failed to meet the $40,000 reserve price expected by the seller.

The Timothy Dexter House was briefly converted into an inn shortly after Dexter&#x27;s widow Elizabeth died in 1809, followed by a succession of private owners. In 1984, William Quill, a Newburyport local raised on Johnston St, purchased the house for $200,000 and restored it. As restoration works came close to completion, a blowtorch accident on 15 August 1988 caused a fire that gutted the building, but original blueprints preserved by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities allowed the house to be rebuilt exactly as it was. The Timothy Dexter House remains the Quill family&#x27;s private residence to this day.

After Dexter&#x27;s death, a street that intersects the High St corner where the Timothy Dexter House is located was named &quot;Dexter Ln&quot; in his honor. The first house built on the street was constructed in 1967. The Dexter Lane Project, a 16-unit affordable housing development, is currently planned to be built at 14 Dexter Ln.

<text>The marbled godwit (Limosa fedoa) is a large migratory shorebird in the family Scolopacidae. On average, it is the largest of the four species of godwit.

==Taxonomy==
In 1750 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the marbled godwit in the third volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Greater American Godwit&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from the Hudson Bay area of Canada by James Isham. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the marbled godwit with godwits and ibises in the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Scolopax fedoa&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The marbled godwit is now placed in the genus &quot;Limosa&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name &quot;Limosa&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;muddy&quot;, from &quot;limus&quot;, &quot;mud&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;fedoa&quot; may be an Old English name for a godwit. The word was mentioned by the English naturalist William Turner in 1544.

Two subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;L. f. beringiae&quot; Gibson &amp; Kessel, 1989 – breeds in Alaska and winters in the west United States. Averages shorter legs and bill than nominate subspecies.
*&quot;L. f. fedoa&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds in central, south-central Canada, and the north-central United States, winters in southern United States to northwest South America. A disjunct breeding population breeds in James Bay.

==Description==
The total length is , including a large bill of , and wingspan is . Body mass can vary from . The average weight of 40 males was and that of 45 females was . Bill length is from . Among all the members of the sandpiper family, only the curlews attain sizes that significantly exceed this species.

Adults have long blue-grey legs and a very long pink bill with a slight upward curve and dark at the tip. The long neck, breast and belly are pale brown with dark bars on the breast and flanks. The back is mottled and dark. They show cinnamon wing linings in flight.

==Distribution and habitat==
Marbled godwits breed in three distinct areas with their own unique route. The vast majority occur in mid-continental North America, followed by eastern Canada and the Alaska Peninsula, USA. In addition, the largest winter ranges are the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts of the US and Mexico.

Godwits breeding in the western USA and Canada follow a route through the Utah stopover site, with a final arrival in the winter sites of Mexico and the Caribbean. Species breeding in eastern Canada migrate across the US, and stopover at sites along the Gulf of California and Mexico. Furthermore, those breeding in North and South Dakota winter in coastal Georgia. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge located at Great Salt Lake in Utah (USA), is one of the most popular stopover sites for godwits in the spring and fall.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===
They nest on the ground, usually in short grass.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage by probing on mudflats, in marshes, or at the beach (see picture below). When the tide is out, they eat. In short grass, they may pick up insects by sight. They mainly eat insects and crustaceans, but also eat parts of aquatic plants.

When the tide is in, they roost. They often sleep by standing on one leg and tucking their bill into their body (see picture below).

==Conservation==
Their numbers were reduced by hunting at the end of the 19th century. Although they had recovered somewhat since that time, their population has declined in recent times as suitable habitat is used for farming.

<text>The Texas 7 were a group of prisoners who escaped from the John B. Connally Unit near Kenedy, Texas, on December 13, 2000. Six of the seven were apprehended over a month later, between January 22–24, 2001, as a direct result of the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. The seventh committed suicide before he could be arrested. The surviving members were all convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Irving, Texas, police officer Aubrey Wright Hawkins, who was shot and killed when responding to a robbery perpetrated by the Texas Seven. Four of the six sentenced have since been executed, and another has been granted a new trial based on alleged judicial bias.

== Members ==
The group included the following Texas state prisoners:
* Joseph Christopher Garcia (November 6, 1971, in San Antonio, Texas – December 4, 2018, in Huntsville, Texas), &quot;executed&quot;.
** Garcia was originally convicted of murder for killing Miguel Luna in 1996 during a drunken altercation.
* Randy Ethan Halprin (born September 13, 1977, in McKinney, Texas), convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 but awarded a new trial by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on November 6, 2024.
** Halprin was originally convicted for child abuse after &quot;[breaking] a 16-month-old&#x27;s arms and legs, fracturing his skull and beating his face until one eye filled with blood.&quot;
* Larry James Harper (September 10, 1963, in Danville, Illinois – January 22, 2001, in Woodland Park, Colorado), committed suicide by a gunshot to the heart before he could be captured by law enforcement.
** Harper was originally convicted on three counts of aggravated sexual assault after &quot;a series of violent rapes&quot; against women in El Paso.
* Patrick Henry Murphy Jr. (born October 3, 1961, in Dallas, Texas), on Texas Death Row awaiting execution.
** Murphy was originally convicted for aggravated sexual assault after &quot;breaking into a woman&#x27;s home and sexually assaulting her at knifepoint.&quot;
* Donald Keith Newbury (May 18, 1962, in Albuquerque, New Mexico – February 4, 2015, in Huntsville, Texas), &quot;executed&quot;.
** Newbury was originally convicted for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon.
* George Angel Rivas Jr. (May 6, 1970, in El Paso, Texas – February 29, 2012, in Huntsville, Texas), &quot;executed&quot;.
** Rivas was originally convicted of robbery.
* Michael Anthony Rodriguez (October 29, 1962, in San Antonio, Texas – August 14, 2008, in Huntsville, Texas), &quot;executed&quot;.
** Rodriguez was originally convicted of capital murder for hiring Rolando Ruiz to murder his wife Theresa in 1992. Also convicted were Rodriguez&#x27;s brother Mark, Joe Ramon and Robert Silva. He was an alumnus of Central Catholic Marianist High School, and had taken teacher training classes at Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University). Michael Anthony Rodriguez&#x27;s father, Raul Rodriguez, pled guilty to escape and providing implements for escape and elected to have a jury determine his sentence. He was sentenced to 10 years for escape and 5 years for providing implements for escape and fined $10,000 for each of the convictions. A later appeal was rejected in 2006.

On December 13, 2000, the seven carried out an elaborate scheme and escaped from the John B. Connally Unit, a maximum-security state prison near the South Texas city of Kenedy.

At the time of the breakout, the reported ringleader of the Texas Seven, 30-year-old George Rivas, was serving 18 consecutive 15-to-life sentences. Michael Anthony Rodriguez, 38, was serving a 99-to-life term for contracting the murder of his wife by Rolando Ruiz Jr., who was later executed for the crime on March 7, 2017. Larry James Harper, 37, Joseph Garcia, 29, and Patrick Henry Murphy Jr., 39, were all serving 50-year sentences. Donald Keith Newbury, 38, the member with the longest rap sheet in the group, was serving a 99-year sentence. Randy Halprin, 23, was serving a 30-year sentence for injury to a child, and was the youngest member.

Using several well-planned ploys, the seven convicts overpowered and restrained nine civilian maintenance supervisors, including their boss, four correctional officers, and three uninvolved inmates, at approximately 11:20. The escape occurred during lunch and at count time; the &quot;slowest&quot; period of the prison day, when there was less surveillance of certain locations, such as the maintenance area. Most of these plans involved one of the offenders calling someone over while another hit the unsuspecting person on the head from behind. Once each victim was knocked unconscious, the offenders removed some of his clothing, tied him up, gagged him, and placed him in an electrical room behind a locked door full of electronics, including warning alarms. The attackers stole clothing, credit cards, and identification from their victims. The group impersonated prison officers on the phone and created false stories to ward off suspicion from authorities. After this first phase, three of the group made their way to the back gate of the prison, some disguised in stolen civilian clothing. They pretended to be there to install video monitors. One guard at the gatehouse was subdued, and the trio raided the guard tower and stole numerous weapons. Meanwhile, the four offenders who stayed behind called the prison tower guards to distract them. They then stole a prison maintenance pick-up truck, which they drove to the back gate of the prison, picked up their cohorts, and drove away from the prison.

Rodriguez&#x27;s father, Raul, had provided the men a getaway car. For this act, he was later convicted of escape and providing implements for escape.

A &quot;Crime Library&quot; article about the seven compared the breakout to the June 1962 Alcatraz escape that occurred decades earlier.

== Crime spree and Officer Aubrey Hawkins ==

The white prison truck was found in the Walmart parking lot in Kenedy, Texas. The Texas Seven first entered San Antonio right after breaking out of the complex. Realizing that they were running out of funds, they robbed a Radio Shack in Pearland, Texas, in Greater Houston, the following day.

On December 19, four of the members checked into an Econo Lodge motel in Farmers Branch, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, under assumed names. They decided to rob an Oshman&#x27;s Sporting Goods in nearby Irving. On December 24, 2000, they entered the store, bound and gagged all the staff, and stole at least 40 guns and sets of ammunition, including $70,000 from the store&#x27;s safe. An ex-employee in her car outside the store noticed the commotion inside and called the police. Irving police officer Aubrey Wright Hawkins (February 23, 1971 – December 24, 2000) responded to the call and, upon arriving at the scene, was almost immediately ambushed, being shot 11 times and run over by the escaped convicts as they fled the scene. Hawkins died at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas shortly after his arrival. Hawkins had been an officer with the Irving police department since October 4, 1995, and was married and had a son.

After Officer Hawkins&#x27; murder, a $100,000 reward was offered to whoever could snare the group of criminals. The reward climbed to $500,000 before the six surviving members of the group were apprehended.

== Capture ==

Following an episode of the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; that first aired on January 20, 2001, several people phoned in possible sightings of the suspects at the Coachlight Motel and R.V. Park in Woodland Park, Colorado. They had apparently tried to pass themselves off as missionaries, playing loud Christian music within earshot of their neighbours.

The El Paso County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, Colorado, and Teller County Deputies SWAT team found Garcia, Rodriguez, and Rivas in a Jeep Cherokee in the RV Park, before following them to a nearby gas station where they were arrested, and later found Halprin and Harper in an RV; Halprin surrendered peacefully, but Harper was found dead after a standoff, having shot himself in the chest with a pistol. The surviving four were taken into federal custody.

On January 23, 2001, the FBI received information that the remaining two escapees, Newbury and Murphy, were hiding in a Holiday Inn in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A deal was brokered with the two, allowing them to make live TV appearances before they were arrested. Media was tipped off when a guest asked KKTV chief photographer Mike Petkash and reporter Jeannette Hinds why he could not get to the hotel. The pair drove to the hotel, finding it flooded with law enforcement. In the early hours of January 24, a local KKTV television anchorman, Eric Singer, was taken into the hotel where he interviewed the two by telephone while on camera. Newbury and Murphy harshly denounced the criminal justice system in Texas, with Newbury adding, &quot;the system is as corrupt as we are.&quot;

==Convictions and executions==

In 2008, authorities indicted Patsy Gomez and Raul Rodriguez, the parents of Michael Rodriguez, for conspiring to help the Texas Seven.

George Rivas, the ringleader, was the first to be brought to trial; he was convicted and sentenced to death. Subsequently, the other five surviving members of the Texas Seven were brought to trial, convicted, and sentenced to death.

Rodriguez announced that he wished to forgo further appeal beyond the mandatory death-penalty appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. A court-ordered psychiatric evaluation in January 2007 concluded that he was mentally competent to decide to forgo further appeals. Twenty months later, he became the first of the six surviving members to be executed on August 14, 2008, at 18:30. Rodriguez was TDCJ#999413, and his pre-death sentence TDCJ number was 698074.

George Rivas, TDCJ#999394, was executed almost four years later, on February 29, 2012, at 18:22.

Donald Newbury, TDCJ#999403, was executed by lethal injection on February 4, 2015, at 18:25.

Joseph Garcia, TDCJ#999441, was executed by lethal injection on December 4, 2018, at 18:43.

The remaining two members are incarcerated on death row at the Polunsky Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, located in West Livingston. Neither currently has an execution date.
* Halprin has the TDCJ number 00999453.
* Murphy has the TDCJ number 00999461.

Murphy was scheduled for execution twice, first on March 28, 2019. The United States Supreme Court granted him a last-minute reprieve on the basis that TDCJ&#x27;s denial of his request to have a Buddhist priest in the execution room with him violated the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution. Murphy was then given a second execution date, November 13, 2019. However, his execution was stayed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on November 7 to decide whether his religious discrimination lawsuit had merit.

Halprin was scheduled to be executed on October 10, 2019. However, his execution was stayed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on October 4, 2019, due to concerns of racial and religious discrimination from his trial judge. Trial Judge Vickers &quot;Vic&quot; Cunningham allegedly referred to Halprin, who is Jewish, as a &quot;kike&quot; and a &quot;fucking Jew&quot; and said Jews &quot;needed to be shut down because they controlled all the money.&quot; On November 6, 2024, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted Halprin&#x27;s request for a new trial based on the finding that Judge Cunningham&#x27;s anti-Semitic bias deprived Halprin of due process of law.

The bodies of Harper, Rodriguez, Newbury, and Garcia are buried at Captain Joe Byrd Cemetery.

== Media portrayals ==
In 2001, the American Court TV (now TruTV) television series &quot;Mugshots&quot; released an episode covering Rivas, titled &quot;Mugshots - George Rivas&quot;.

In 2007, Wild Dream Films produced &quot;The Hunt For The Texas 7&quot;, a 90-minute feature documentary about the prison break. The film features interviews with members of The Texas 7 currently on Death Row and eyewitnesses to their crimes. The film was aired in late September 2008 on MSNBC.

On March 25, 2011, Investigation Discovery aired an episode about the case on the show , subtitled &quot;The Deadly Seven&quot;. One year later, on March 23, 2012, Investigation Discovery aired an episode of Werner Herzog&#x27;s documentary series &quot;On Death Row&quot;, which dealt with Rivas and Garcia. The seven were also featured in an episode of &quot;Real Prison Breaks&quot; on ITV4 in the UK.

On July 30, 2014, Investigation Discovery&#x27;s &quot;I (Almost) Got Away with It&quot; aired an episode titled &quot;Got to Be Part of the Texas Seven.&quot;

Rivas had married a Canadian woman by proxy.

Halprin had also married by proxy.
On December 22, 2017, rapper Jay-Z released a music video for his song &#x27;Legacy&#x27;, in which a dramatized version of events is depicted by several well known actors.

In Spring 2019, ITV UK produced the series: &quot;Death Row: Countdown To Execution&quot; hosted by Susanna Reid. Episode 1 chronicles the case of one of the members of Texas 7: Patrick Murphy. The series aired in the UK in June 2019.

The December 8, 2023, episode of the Oxygen Network series &quot;Homicide for the Holidays&quot; portrayed the events in an episode entitled &quot;Christmas Eve Killing&quot;.

<doc id="317597" wikidata="Q320002" url="?curid=317597" title="Sampler (musical instrument)">
<text>A sampler is an electronic musical instrument that records and plays back samples (portions of sound recordings). Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sound effects or longer portions of music.

The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played sounds recorded on tape, such as the Mellotron. As technology improved, cheaper standalone samplers with more memory emerged, such as the E-mu Emulator, Akai S950 and Akai MPC.

Samples may be loaded or recorded by the user or by a manufacturer. The samples can be played back by means of the sampler program itself, a MIDI keyboard, sequencer or another triggering device (e.g., electronic drums). Because these samples are usually stored in digital memory, the information can be quickly accessed. A single sample may be pitch-shifted to different pitches to produce musical scales and chords.

Often samplers offer filters, effects units, modulation via low frequency oscillation and other synthesizer-like processes that allow the original sound to be modified in many different ways. Most samplers have Multitimbrality capabilities – they can play back different sounds simultaneously. Many are also polyphonic – they are able to play more than one note at the same time.
==History==
Prior to computer memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron was the most notable model, used by a number of groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical.

The earliest digital sampling was done on the EMS Musys system, developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing) and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio c. 1969. The system ran on two mini-computers, Digital Equipment PDP-8&#x27;s. These had a pair of fast D/A and A/D converters, 12,000 (12k) bytes of core memory (RAM), backed up by a hard drive of 32k and by tape storage (DecTape). EMS equipment was used to control the world&#x27;s first digital studio (EMS London (Putney) Studio), and their earliest digital sampling was done on that system during 1971–1972 for Harrison Birtwistle&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Chronometer&quot; released in 1975.

The first commercially available sampling synthesizer was the Computer Music Melodian by Harry Mendell (1976), while the first polyphonic digital sampling synthesizer was the Australian-produced Fairlight CMI, first available in 1979. These early sampling synthesizers used wavetable sample-based synthesis. The Fairlight CMI played and recorded low quality samples at 8-bit audio depth and 824 kHz sampling rate.

In 1981, Toshiba introduced the LMD-649 in Japan. It was an early digital sampler that played and recorded high quality pulse-code modulation (PCM) samples at 12-bit audio depth and 50 kHz sampling rate, stored in 128 KB of dynamic RAM. It was created by engineer Kenji Murata for Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who used it for extensive sampling and looping in their 1981 album &quot;Technodelic&quot;. The LMD-649 was also used by other Japanese synthpop artists in the early 1980s, including Chiemi Manabe and Logic System.

Sampling keyboards were notable for their high price which was out of reach for the majority of working musicians – with the early Fairlight starting at $30,000. The E-mu Emulator brought the price down to under $10,000 but it was not until the mid-1980s that genuinely affordable keyboard samplers began to hit the market with the Ensoniq Mirage in 1985 and the E-mu Emax the following year, which had a sub-$2000 price point. The Korg DSS-1 and Roland&#x27;s S-Series followed shortly afterwards.

During the 1980s, hybrid synthesizers began to utilize short samples (such as the attack phase of an instrument) along with digital synthesis to create more realistic imitations of instruments than had previously been possible. Examples are the Korg M1, Roland U-110, Yamaha&#x27;s SY series, and the Kawai K series of instruments. Limiting factors at the time were the cost of physical memory (RAM) and the limitations of external data storage devices, and this approach made best use of the tiny amount of memory available to the design engineers. 

The E-mu SP-1200 percussion sampler, upon its release in August 1987, popularized the use of digital samplers within hip hop music in the late 1980s. Akai pioneered many processing techniques, such as crossfade looping and &quot;time stretch&quot; to shorten or lengthen samples without affecting pitch and vice versa. The Akai MPC60, released in 1988, went on to become the most influential sampler in hip hop music. That same year, the Ensoniq EPS – the successor to the Mirage – was launched and was the first sampling keyboard which was designed specifically for live performance rather being a purely studio based tool as most samplers had been hitherto.

The 2010s-era music workstation usually uses sampling, whether simple playback or complex editing that matches all but the most advanced dedicated samplers, and also includes features such as a sequencer. Samplers, together with traditional Foley artists, are the mainstay of modern sound effects production. Using digital techniques various effects can be pitch-shifted and otherwise altered in ways that would have required many hours when done with tape.

==Elements==

===Interface===
Usually a sampler is controlled by an attached music keyboard or other external MIDI controller or source. Each note-message received by the sampler accesses a particular sample. Often multiple samples are arranged across the keyboard, each assigned to a note or group of notes. Keyboard tracking allows samples to be shifted in pitch by an appropriate amount, typically in semitones and tones. Each group of notes to which a single sample has been assigned is often called a &quot;keyzone&quot;, and the resultant set of zones is called a keymap.

For example, in Fig 1, a keymap has been created with four different samples. Each sample, if pitched, should be associated with a particular center pitch. The first sample (Violin G#2) is distributed across three different notes, G2, G#2, and A2. If the note G#2 is received the sampler will play back the Violin G#2 sample at its original pitch. If the note received is G2 the sampler will shift the sample down a semitone while the note A2 will play it back a semitone tone higher. If the next note (Bb2) is input the sampler will select the Violin B2 sample, playing it a semitone lower than its center pitch of B2.

In general, samplers can play back any kind of recorded audio. Most samplers offer editing tools that allow the user to modify and process the audio and apply a wide range of effects. This makes the sampler a powerful and versatile musical tool.

===Hierarchy===
A sampler is organized into a hierarchy of progressively more complicated data structures. At the bottom lie samples, individual recordings of any sound, recorded at a particular sample rate and resolution. While a common sound to sample is a musical instrument being played (e.g., a pianist playing a piano note or an organist playing a pipe organ), a sample could be any sound, including &quot;non-musical&quot; sounds such as a typewriter clacking or a dog barking. A reference center pitch indicates the actual frequency of the recorded note. Samples may also be &quot;looped&quot; by defining points at which a repeated section of the sample starts and ends, allowing a relatively short sample to play endlessly. In some cases, a &quot;loop crossfade&quot; is indicated, allowing less obvious transitions at the loop point by fading the end of the loop out while fading its beginning in.

Keymaps are arranged into instruments. At this level parameters may be added to define how the keymaps are played. Filters can be applied to change the sound-color while low frequency oscillators and envelope generators can shape the amplitude, pitch, filter or other parameters of the sound. Instruments may have multiple layers of keymaps to play more than one sample at the same time and each keymap may have a different set of parameters so that the incoming note-events affect each layer differently. For example, two layers may have a different sensitivity to the velocity of the incoming note, altering the resulting timbre according to how hard the note is played.

At this level, there are two basic approaches to sampler organization. In a bank approach, each instrument is assigned to a different MIDI channel and multiple banks can be stored to reconfigure the sampler. A different and more powerful approach is to associate each instrument with a patch number or ID so that each MIDI channel can be configured separately by sending controller information on the individual channel.

===Types===
Many samplers work as described above: the keymapping system &quot;spread out&quot; a sample over a certain range of keys. This has side-effects that may be desirable in some contexts, such as speeding up or slowing down drum loops. However, the higher and lower-pitched parts of such a keymap may sound unnatural. For example, if a harpsichord is sampled in its lower register and then the samples are moved up to very high pitches, the high notes may not sound natural and authentic. When arranging a pitched instrument over several keymaps, the transition from one to another may be too noticeable for realistic imitation of the instrument – the art is to make transitions as smooth as possible.

Some phrase samplers are more optimised for triggering single &quot;one-shot&quot; sounds such as drum hits. Each keymap spans only a single key, requiring a large number of zones (61 on a five-octave keyboard), each with its own settings. &quot;Phrase sampling&quot; aims to simplify this, particularly on interfaces such as the 16 pads on the Akai MPC series: the fact that each pad is actually a note is hidden from the user. The sampling engine does not re-pitch samples, it only plays them back. The user interface is simplified. Phrase samplers often have a groovebox format, which makes them lightweight, easy to operate and light to carry.

===Specifications===
Samplers can be classified by several specifications;
*Polyphony: How many voices (or notes) can play simultaneously, to create chords
*Sample Space: How much memory is available to load samples
*Channels: How many different MIDI channels are available for different instruments
*Bit depth: How much sample resolution can be supported
*Outputs: How many discrete audio outputs are available

==Manufacturers and models==

===Computer Music Melodian===
Computer Music Inc. was started in New Jersey United States in 1972 by Harry Mendell and Dan Coren. The company was established to develop and market musical instruments based on computer software. The Melodian, developed in 1976, was based on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s PDP-8 computer. It included hand-wired digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion functions, as well as tracking anti-aliasing filters. The Melodian was first used by Stevie Wonder on his album &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; (1979).

The Melodian was a monophonic synthesizer with 12-bit analog-to-digital sampling at rates up to 22 kHz. It was designed to be compatible with analog synthesizers and had a feature allowing it to synchronize to the pitch of an analog synthesizer, such as an ARP 2600. This meant that the Melodian captured all frequency modulation effects, including those produced through the ARP&#x27;s touch ribbon control. It also could trigger off the ARPs keyboard, thus functioning somewhat as a hybrid of sampler and analog synthesizer and making the most of the technology available at the time.

===Synclavier===

The Synclavier System was an early digital synthesizer and sampler, manufactured by New England Digital. First released in 1977, it proved to be highly influential among both music producers and electronic musicians, due to its versatility, its cutting-edge technology and distinctive sound. Synclavier Systems were expensive – the highest price ever paid for one was about $500,000, although average systems were closer to about $200,000 – $300,000. Although this made it inaccessible for most musicians, it found widespread use among producers and professional recording studios, and it competed in this market with other high-end production systems, such as the Fairlight CMI. Though scarce, the Synclavier remains in use in many studios to this day.

===Fairlight Instruments===
Fairlight Instruments was started in Sydney, in 1975 by Peter Vogel and Kim Ryrie. The company was originally established as a manufacturer and retailer of video special effects equipment.

The Fairlight CMI or Computer Music Instrument, released in 1979, started life as the Qasar M8. The M8 was handwired and legend has it that it took two hours to boot up. The CMI was the first commercially available polyphonic digital sampling instrument. The original Fairlight CMI sampled using a resolution of 8 bits per sample, at a rate of 24 kHz, and used two 8-bit Motorola 6800 processors (later upgraded to the more powerful 16/32-bit Motorola 68000). It was equipped with two six-octave keyboards, an alphanumeric keyboard, and an interactive video display unit (VDU) where soundwaves could be edited or even drawn from scratch using a light pen. Software allowed for editing, looping, and mixing of sounds which could then be played back via the keyboard or the software-based sequencer. It retailed for around US$25,000.

Fairlight later released the Series IIx, which increased the sampling rate to 32 kHz and was the first to feature basic MIDI functionality. In 1985, the Series III was released with two significant upgrades: bit rate and sampling rate were increased to CD quality (16 bit/44.1 kHz) and SMPTE time code was now supported. Notable users of the Fairlight CMI include Peter Gabriel, Herbie Hancock, Trevor Horn, Art of Noise, Yello, Pet Shop Boys, Jean Michel Jarre, Duran Duran and Kate Bush. Horn, considered the &quot;Man who invented the eighties&quot;, first used his well-known sampling techniques on the album &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot;, the second studio album released under the name of his project The Buggles. Saying that he was &quot;quite fascinated by Fairlight brass and all of those kind of things that Geoffrey and I had started messing around with before he went off to join Asia&quot;, the sampling techniques on &quot;Adventures&quot; would later be used for records Horn produced like &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; by Grace Jones, Art of Noise&#x27;s &quot;The Seduction of Claude Debussy&quot; and Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;.

===E-mu Systems===

E-mu Emulator (1981) was E-mu Systems&#x27; initial foray into sampling, and saved the company from financial disaster after the complete failure of the Audity due to a price tag of $70,000. The name &#x27;Emulator&#x27; came as the result of leafing through a thesaurus and matched the name of the company perfectly. The Emulator came in 2-, 4-, and 8-note polyphonic versions, the 2-note being dropped due to limited interest, and featured a maximum sampling rate of 27.7 kHz, a four-octave keyboard and 128 kB of memory.

E-mu Emulator II (1984) was designed to bridge the gap between the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier and the Ensoniq Mirage. It featured 8 notes polyphony, 8-bit sampling, 512kb of RAM (1mb in the EII+ though only accessible as two independent 512kb banks), an 8-track sequencer, and analog filtering. With the addition of the hard disk option, the Emulator II was comparable to samplers released 5 years later.

E-mu SP-12 (1986) was a forerunner of E-mu SP-1200.

E-mu Emulator III (1987) was a 16-bit stereo digital sampler with 16-note polyphony, 44.1 kHz maximum sample rate and had up to 8 MB of memory. It featured a 16 channel sequencer, SMPTE and a 40 MB hard disk.

E-mu SP-1200 (1987) was, and still is, one of the most highly regarded samplers for use in hip-hop related production. Its 12-bit sampling engine gave a desirable warmth to instruments and a gritty punch to drums. It featured 10 seconds of sample time spread across four 2.5-second sections.

E-mu Emax, sold between 1985 &amp; 1995, and aimed at the lower end of the market.

E-mu ESI-32 (1994) was a stripped down, far cheaper, and simplified EIIIx, and could use the same samples. The unit could accommodate up to 32 MB RAM, 32 note polyphony and sounds could be routed internally to one of four polyphonic outputs. Via optional SCSI interface, the ESI-32 could access external CD-ROM, Zip-100, and hard drives.
===Akai===


Akai entered the electronic musical instrument world in 1984 when Roger Linn, the creator of the Linn LM-1, the Linn 9000, and the LinnDrum, partnered with the Japanese/Singaporean Akai Corporation to create samplers similar to the ones created at Linn&#x27;s own company, Linn Electronics. With this came the first in a series of affordable samplers, the S612, a 12 bit digital sampler module. The S612 was superseded in 1986 by the S900.

The Akai S900 (1986) was the first truly affordable digital sampler. It was 8-note polyphonic and featured 12-bit sampling with a frequency range up to 40 kHz and up to 750 kB of memory that allowed for just under 12 seconds at the best sampling rate. It could store a maximum of 32 samples in memory. The operating system was software based and allowed for upgrades that had to be booted each time the sampler was switched on.

The Akai MPC60 Digital Sampler/Drum Machine and MIDI Sequencer (1988) was the first non-rack mounted model released. It is also the first time a sampler with touch sensitive trigger pads was produced by AKAI, giving birth to the popular MPC series of sampler sequencers.

The Akai S950 (1988) was an improved version of the S900, with a maximum sample frequency of 48 kHz and some of the editing features of the contemporary S1000.

The Akai S1000 (1988) was possibly the most popular 16-bit 44.1 kHz stereo sampler of its time. It featured 16-voices, up to 32 MB of memory, and 24-bit internal processing, including a digital filter (18 dB/octave), an LFO, and two ADSR envelope generators (for amplitude and filtering). The S1000 also offered up to 8 different loop points. Additional functions included Autolooping, Crossfade Looping, Loop in Release (which cycles through the loop as the sound decays), Loop Until Release (which cycles through the loop until the note begins its decay), Reverse and Time Stretch (version 1.3 and higher).

Other samplers released by AKAI include the S01, S20, S700, S2000, S2800, S3000, S3000XL, S3200, S5000, S6000, MPC500, MPC1000, MPC2000, MPC2000XL, MPC2500, MPC3000, MPC3000XL, MPC3000LE, MPC4000, MPC5000, Z4 and Z8.
===Roland===
Roland Corporation manufactured the S series. These were true samplers that provide all of the features described above, including sampling, sample editing, pitch transposition, and keyzone mapping:
* Roland S-10
* Roland S-50
* Roland S-330
* Roland S-550
* Roland S-760
* Roland S-770
More recently, Roland introduced the &quot;Groove Sampler&quot; concept. These devices are renowned for their ease of use, but a few lack the pitch transposition and keyzone mapping capabilities that most samplers have. Some have limits to rendering loops or sound effects samples that are played back at the same pitch they were recorded. Although these machines are equipped with a wide range of built-in effects, a few lack pitch transposition and keyzone mapping that diminishes their utility significantly. The Roland &quot;Groove Sampler&quot; line includes the following:
* Roland DJ-70MKII
* Roland DJ-70 
* Roland JS-30
* Roland MC-909
* Roland MC-808
* Roland MC-09
* Roland MS-1
* Roland MV-8800
* Roland MV-8000
* Roland SP-808EX
* Roland SP-808
* Roland SP-404
* Roland SP-606
* Roland SP-555
* Roland W-30
* Roland SPD-SX
===Boss===
Being a division of the Roland Corporation, Boss also contributed to the &quot;Groove Sampler/Groove Box&quot; concept with several samplers.
* Boss SP-202
* Boss SP-303
* Boss SP-505

===Sample storage===
Most older samplers use SCSI as the protocol for getting sample data in and out of the machine. SCSI interfaces were either standard on the sampler or offered as an option. SCSI provides the ability to move large quantities of data in and out of a sampler in reasonable times. Hard drives, CD-ROM drives, Zip drives and removable cartridge drives such as Syquest and Iomega Jaz drives are the most popular SCSI devices used with samplers. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, with hard drives being the fastest devices. Modern (after 2000) samplers use solid-state memory cards (such as compact Flash or SmartMedia) for sample storage and transfer.

==Software samplers==
In the 1990s and 2000s, the increases in computer power and memory capacity have made it possible to develop software applications that provide the same capabilities as hardware-based units. These are typically produced as plug-in instruments – for example, using the VST system. Some such samplers provide relatively simple sample playback facilities, requiring the user to turn to other software for such tasks as sample editing, sample recording, and DSP effects, while others provide features beyond those offered by rack-mounted units.

=== Trackers ===

In the 1980s, users on Home computers invented Trackers. Sequencers are software samplers as the real-time resampling is a required capability for the Tracker concept. Since the 1980s, Trackers were able to perform 4-channel resampling in realtime under usage of the Paula Chip on the Amiga. Since the early 1990s Trackers performed on PCs multi-track resampling in realtime as pure software solution. This was possible under the usage of highly optimized assembly code, an early example is the &quot;InertiaPlayer&quot; released in 1993. A recent PC Tracker with good sampler capabilities is for instance the &quot;Renoise&quot; Tracker.

<text>St Kilda is an inner seaside suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, southeast of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. St Kilda recorded a population of 19,490 at the 2021 census.

St Kilda was named by Charles La Trobe, then superintendent of the Port Phillip District, after a schooner, &quot;Lady of St Kilda&quot;, which moored at the main beach in early 1842. Later in the Victorian era, St Kilda became a favoured suburb of Melbourne&#x27;s elite, and many palatial mansions and grand terraces were constructed along its hills and waterfront. After the turn of the century, the St Kilda foreshore became Melbourne&#x27;s favoured playground, with electric tram lines linking the suburbs to the seaside amusement rides, ballrooms, cinemas and cafes, and crowds flocked to St Kilda Beach. Many of the mansions and grand terraces became guest houses, and gardens were filled in with apartment buildings, making St Kilda the most densely populated suburb in Melbourne.

After World War II, St Kilda became Melbourne&#x27;s red-light district, and the guest houses became low-cost rooming houses. By the late 1960s, St Kilda had developed a culture of bohemianism, attracting prominent artists and musicians, including those in the punk and LGBT subcultures. While some of these groups still maintain a presence in St Kilda, since the 2000s the district has experienced rapid gentrification, pushing many lower socio-economic groups out to other areas, with the suburb again being sought after by the wealthy. Since at least the 1950s, the suburb has been the centre of Melbourne&#x27;s Jewish community.

St Kilda is home to many of Melbourne&#x27;s visitor attractions including Luna Park, St Kilda Pier, the Palais Theatre and the Esplanade Hotel. It hosts many of Melbourne&#x27;s big events and festivals.

==Name==

Before being officially named &quot;St Kilda&quot; in 1842 by Charles La Trobe, who was superintendent of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales, the area was known by several names, including &#x27;Green Knoll&#x27;, &#x27;Punk Town&#x27; and &#x27;The Village of Fareham&#x27;. It was eventually named after the schooner &quot;Lady of St Kilda&quot;, which was owned between 1834 and 1840 by Sir Thomas Acland. Acland sold the vessel in 1840 to Jonathan Cundy Pope of Plymouth. The vessel sailed for Port Phillip in February 1841. The ship was used in Port Phillip as a cargo vessel; in January 1842 it was docked in Hobson Bay and listed for sale by exchange of sheep. The vessel was moored at the main beach for the early part of 1842, which was soon known as &quot;the St Kilda foreshore&quot;.

The schooner &quot;Lady of St Kilda&quot; was named in honour of Lady Grange, who was imprisoned by her husband between 1734 and 1740 on the island of Hirta, the largest island in the St Kilda archipelago, on the western edge of Scotland.

==History==


The Euroe Yroke area (now known as St Kilda) was inhabited an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years ago. Evidence has been found of shellfish middens and huts along Albert Park and Lake and axes which were most likely sharpened on the sandstone cliffs behind the main beach. Corroborees were held at the historic tree which still stands at St Kilda Junction, at the corner of Fitzroy Street and Queens Road. Much of the area north of present-day Fitzroy Street was swampland, part of the Yarra River delta, which comprised vast areas of wetlands and sparse vegetation.

The first European settler in St Kilda was Benjamin Baxter in around 1839. He was a settler from Melbourne on a grazing lease. In 1840, St Kilda was the home to Melbourne&#x27;s first quarantine station for Scottish immigrants.

The area was officially named &quot;St Kilda&quot; in 1842. The first sale of Crown lands for the village of St Kilda took place on 7 December 1842. The first block was bought by James Ross Lawrence, who had been master of the &quot;Lady of St Kilda&quot; until 1842. Lawrence had now settled in Melbourne. His block was bounded by three unmade roads. One of these roads he named Acland Street, after Thomas Acland, who had been his employer until 1840 but who had never been to Port Phillip District. The remaining two became Fitzroy Street and The Esplanade. (A plaque at the junction of Acland and Fitzroy Streets marks the site of the block.) By 1845, Lawrence had subdivided and sold the land on which he had built a cottage. The land on the sea side of The Esplanade has continued to be Crown land.

Within a few years St Kilda became a fashionable area for the wealthy, and the indigenous peoples were driven out to surrounding areas. The high ground above the beach offered a cool fresh breeze during Melbourne&#x27;s hot summer months.

St Kilda became a separate municipality on 24 April 1857, and in the same year, the railway line connected St Kilda to Melbourne city, and a loop line to Windsor. These railway lines made the area even more attractive as a place to settle, and attracted visitors to St Kilda Beach, the St Kilda Pier, the privately run sea baths, and events like the St Kilda Cup. Cricket and bowling clubs were formed in 1855 and 1865 respectively. By the mid-1860s St Kilda had about fifteen hotels, including the George (which began as the Terminus in 1857).

===Land boom===

St Kilda&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1870 and 1890, to about 19,000 persons. By the time of the Land Boom of the 1880s St Kilda had become a district of great mansions, large villas in extensive gardens, grand terraces, and palatial hotels, particularly along the main streets such as Fitzroy Street, Grey Street and Acland Street, while the other streets were lined with villas and terraces of more modest dimensions. The area known as St Kilda Hill, on the other side of High Street (now known as the St Kilda part of St Kilda Road and originally lined with shops), between Wellington Street, Alma Road, and Chapel Street was also developed with mansions and large houses, as well as St Kilda&#x27;s Synagogue. The Esplanade Hotel was built in 1878 overlooking St Kilda Beach, and the George Hotel opposite the station was greatly expanded in 1889. The smaller streets with smaller blocks between the big estates were developed with modest cottages and terraces, housing the working class population of the area.

The flatter inland areas of St Kilda East was also dominated by mansions and large villas in extensive grounds, but also smaller more typical Victorian houses. Much of the area which is now St Kilda West was swampland, but was reclaimed and subdivided in the 1870s, with more large houses and terraces, mostly in the area close to Fitzroy Street.

Cable tram lines across Melbourne were built in the late 1880s, with a line from Swanston Street in central Melbourne along St Kilda Road to St Kilda Junction completed in 1888, and a line from Windsor station at Chapel Street along Wellington Street and Fitzroy Streets, then around the Esplanade opening in 1891, making the suburb and the beachfront easily accessible.

===Seaside playground===
The boom of the 1880s ended with the bank crashes of the early 1890s and subsequent depression, affecting all levels of society, but ruining many of the newly wealthy. Many of St Kilda&#x27;s mansions and spacious terrace houses became guest houses, and the wealthy elite retreated to other exclusive suburbs such as Brighton and Toorak.

From 1906, the Victorian Railways operated a tram line, described as an &#x27;Electric Street Railway&#x27;, from St Kilda Station to Brighton, via Grey Street, Barkly Street and Mitford Street in Elwood. The developing electric tram lines in the east and southeastern suburbs soon arrived as well, with two lines terminating in front of Luna Park by 1913, joined by the electric line that replaced the cable car in 1925, bringing cords of day-trippers to the beach front.
Carlo Catani, a native of Italy, a local resident, and Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department, was a founding member of the St Kilda Foreshore Committee established in 1906, tasked with the beautification of the St Kilda foreshore, for which he did the design. His plan saw the creation of park and lawn areas, paths and promenades, rockeries and gardens and avenues of trees and palms right along the foreshore. The committee also oversaw the leases for the various amusement operators wishing to cater to the growing visitation to the area, which included the Dreamland amusement park (1906 - 1909), a new St Kilda Sea Baths (1910), which replaced the 1862 &quot;Gymnasium Baths&quot;, Luna Park (1912), the Palais de Danse (1919 and 1926), the Palais Theatre (1927), and many others. Catani died in 1918 before he could see the full vision realised, and several landmarks along the foreshore have been named after him, including a memorial clock tower, gardens and an arch. Other amusements developed in the area, such as the Wattle Path Palais dance hall (later the St Moritz Ice Rink) on the Upper Esplanade, and the Venue next door, and the Victory Cinema in 1928 on the corner of Barkly and Carlisle (later the National Theatre). St Kilda served a similar function for Melburnians as did Coney Island to the residents of New York City. with Acland Street and Fitzroy Street became lined with shops, often built in the front gardens of the earlier houses, which housed numerous restaurants and cafes. Apartment development also concentrated in the area, some in the gardens of the mansions, some replacing them, or transforming them, with the result that St Kilda became the most densely populated suburb in Melbourne, often single people who moved away from family life, which combined with the numerous sometimes late night amusements, gave the suburb a racy reputation. This reputation was exacerbated by the Great Depression, and it became the growing focus of many of Melbourne&#x27;s social issues including crime, prostitution and drug abuse.

St Kilda had become a favoured location for Melbourne&#x27;s wealthier Jewish community in the 19th century, which continued through the interwar years. The community grew markedly just before and after World War II, with refugees from war-torn European, and developed an Orthodox community along with the existing Reformed one, opening new synagogues and schools. They settled in apartments in St Kilda, East St Kilda and Elwood, and Acland Street. Cafe Scheherazade on Acland Street was established in the 1950s, and served up borscht and latkes for decades, becoming an icon for this community. By the 1980s, the Jewish centre of Melbourne had moved eastward to more affluent Caulfield. Scheherazade moved to Caulfield in 2008.

===Decline===
World War II saw servicemen flock to the beach amusements, where they also met members of the opposite sex, increasing St Kilda&#x27;s reputation for loose morals. Leo&#x27;s Spaghetti bar and gelateria was opened for the Olympics in 1956 by an Italian migrant as one of Melbourne&#x27;s first Italian restaurants and quickly became a Melbourne establishment.

With numerous small apartments, and plenty of meeting places, St Kilda became one of the city&#x27;s main areas of bohemianism, as well as attracting a gay and lesbian population. From 1965, Mirka Mora&#x27;s Tolarno Hotel became the focus of many of the local artists. By the mid 1960s the Fitzroy Street area had become known for prostitution, with a number of strip-tease cabarets, notably at the once high-class George Hotel.

In the early 1960s works to the Lower Esplanade turned it into a fast moving connection between Marine Parade and Beaconsfield Parade, creating a barrier to the beach, except for a pedestrian crossover and several traffic lights. In 1968, the Palais de Danse, adjacent to the Palais was gutted by fire. The Palace nightclub was built in its place in 1971 (in 2007 this building was closed, gutted by fire, and demolished).

In the late 1960s St Kilda Junction was rebuilt to create a Queens Way underpass connection to Dandenong Road, and in the early 1970s St Kilda Road (formerly High Street) from the junction to Carlisle Street was widened by demolishing all the properties on the west side. The landmark Junction Hotel was lost, and High Street, once St Kilda&#x27;s shopping centre, ceased to function as such. The widening also had the effect of creating a physical barrier between St Kilda&#x27;s foreshore, civic area and eastern residential streets.

The St Moritz ice rink was closed in 1981; around 1982, it was destroyed by a fire.

In 1987, the St Kilda railway line was closed, rationalised and re-opened to become part of route 96, one of the first light rail lines in Melbourne, which left the former rail line at Fitzroy Street, running around the Esplanade, terminating at Acland Street.

===Gentrification===
St Kilda also experienced increased gentrification during the 1990s, particularly popular with yuppies due to its proximity to the CBD. The increased cost of rentals led many long-term residents to leave and removed much of the bohemian and artistic character of the area.

In 1991, the St Moritz hotel opened in the site of the St Moritz ice rink, later the Novotel Bayside in 1993, then Novotel St Kilda in 1999, and itself demolished in 2020.

On 11 September 2003, the St Kilda icon, the 99-year-old pier kiosk, burned down in an arson attack. In a swift and overwhelming response to the loss, the government committed to its original plans using what remained of the original materials.

In mid-1998, Becton, new owners of the Esplanade Hotel announced its plan to build a 125-metre, 38-storey tower behind the historic hotel. The plans were later scaled down due to a strong community campaign, but in 2004, Baymour Court, a significant 1920s Spanish Mission flats behind were demolished despite the campaigning of the National Trust of Victoria and The Esplanade Alliance, as part of the hi-rise Esplanade apartment building.
For the 2006 Commonwealth Games, St Kilda hosted an interpretive public artwork called the Lady of St Kilda, a mock timber sculpture of the shipwreck. The installation was visited by locals and tourists and it was left erected for many months afterward. However, the sculpture was subject to vandals disassembling parts of it as well as concern for children&#x27;s safety on the high unprotected bow of the &quot;ship&quot; so the local council removed it in November 2006.

The area adjacent to the Palais Theatre known as the Triangle Site, including the Palace music venue, is the subject of a major re-development, first proposed in 2005. The proposals stipulated the restoration of the Palais Theatre, but controversially many advocated the demolition of the Palace, one of the area&#x27;s main live music venues. To save the Palace, a legal battle ensued. Ironically, the Palace burned down spectacularly during an arson attack, and fears were held for the Palais. The winning development in 2007 plans a series of lanes, promenades and walkways rambling through eating and drinking spaces, art installations, entertainment venues, retail outlets and open grassy spaces. Further controversy over the new development was caused when the tenants who vacated the Palais illegally removed its 80-year-old chandeliers.

In 2006, plans went out for a foreshore re-development, which included promenade widening and saw the demolition of the bicentennial pavilion which marked the land end of the St Kilda pier.

In 2006, the proposed development of a skate park and concrete urban plaza over parkland on Fitzroy Street next to the primary school at Albert Park caused significant local controversy. The council received a large number of objections. Alternative sites along the foreshore were ignored by council and all of the mature trees on the site were removed before the plans were presented for consultation.
In February 2008, the Port Phillip Council&#x27;s approval of the proposed Triangle site development despite over 5,000 written objections (representing over a quarter of the population of St Kilda) caused an uproar in St Kilda which saw media attention across Victoria with local resident lobby groups including Save St Kilda and UnChain St Kilda banding thousands of residents together in protest and enlisting the help of celebrities including Dave Hughes, Magda Subzanski and Rachel Griffiths in their fight against the local council. The council had refused to allow a secret agreement between it, the developers and state government to be released which effectively allowed for the transfer of ownership of a large amount of Crown land to private owners. As well as the outrage over the sale of public land, many residents believed that the state government and council should have funded the restoration of the heritage Palais themselves rather than pass the costs on to the developers who had proposed a larger development to recover their own costs.

In May 2008, the skate park development was stopped by the Supreme Court of Victoria, claiming that the council had acted inappropriately. A hearing was scheduled with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The mayor at the time, Janet Bolitho, was cited to have commented &quot;the area would remain public open space – just maybe not green&quot;.

In December 2009, a new council elected to largely replace the councillors who approved the Triangle development voted almost unanimously to terminate the agreement with the developers, agreeing to pay them $5 million over a period of three years.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 St Kilda reported a median house price of A$1.34 million for a three bedroom house.

==Demography==
In the 2016 census, there were 20,230 people in St Kilda. 51.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.2%, New Zealand 3.8%, India 2.1%, Ireland 1.9% and China 1.4%. 66.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 1.7%, Spanish 1.7%, Italian 1.5%, French 1.4% and Russian 1.2%. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 45.5%.

Today, St Kilda is an area of sharp social contrast, with many homeless and other disadvantaged people living among the wealthy and fashionable who crowd its shops and cafes. The suburb is noted for its many itinerant backpackers, but also for its many long-term permanent residents.

For many years, St Kilda has had the highest population density in the Melbourne statistical area, and the highest for a metropolitan area outside of Sydney. This density is reflected in the built form, which consists primarily of strata titled units, apartments and flats, including a single Housing Commission of Victoria tower.

==Culture==
===Theatre and cinema===

St Kilda has three historic theatres, each catering to a different niche use; all are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.
*The National Theatre (formerly the Victory) on the corner of Barkly and Carlisle Streets is a Beaux Arts styled performing arts venue built in 1920 and rebuilt in 1928, which has been home to the oldest theatre school in Australia since 1974.
*The Palais Theatre is located on the Lower Esplanade and was built in 1927 to the design of Henry Eli White as a cinema and has been used as a live music and concert venue since the 1970s. 
*The Astor Theatre on Chapel Street is a Art Deco style cinema built in 1935 to the design of Ray Morton Taylor. It features the largest screen in the Southern Hemisphere, and operates as an arthouse cinema with its own year-long film festival and private functions. 

A cinema duplex called the George was built in the 1990s on Fitzroy Street next to the George Hotel, and has been occupied since 2015 by The Alex Theatre.

===Places of worship===

St Kilda is home to a large number of places of worship built over the years to serve primarily the Christian and Jewish faiths, although many of the churches have since been converted for other uses. The St Kilda Hebrew Congregation was established in the 1870s in Charnwood Road, with the present building consecrated on 13 March 1927. Temple Beth Israel, the country&#x27;s largest Progressive Jewish congregation, on Alma Road in East St Kilda, was consecrated in 1938.

The oldest church is Christ Church on the corner Acland Street and Church Square, built in 1854-57 to the designs of Purchas &amp; Swyer in Gothic Revival style and enlarged in 1874 and 1881. It is part of complex including a manse and a hall. The small bluestone Gothic Wesleyan Methodist (later Uniting) Church on the corner Fitzroy and Princes Streets was built in 1858, designed by Crouch &amp; Wilson, and became part of an apartment complex in the late 1990s. All Saints&#x27; Anglican Church, on the corner of Dandenong Road and Chapel Street, was designed by Nathaniel Billing with the foundation stone laid in 1858, becoming what is believed to be the largest Anglican parish church in the southern hemisphere, able to seat 1400 people, All Saints&#x27; is also known for its male choir, which is the only parish church choir of its kind remaining in Australia. The former Baptist Church, built in 1876 at 16 Crimea Street served as a masonic hall before being acquired by St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School. The St Kilda Parish Mission Uniting Church, built in 1877 on the corner Chapel and Carlisle Streets, has a polychromatic brick and slate roof design. St Kilda Presbyterian Church, built in 1878 on the corner of Alma Road and Barkly Street was designed by Wilson &amp; Beswicke architects, in a notably bold Italian medieval style. The Holy Trinity Church built between 1882 and 1889 on the corner of Brighton Road and Dickens Street is by renowned architect Joseph Reed of Reed &amp; Barnes. The Sacred Heart Church, a St Kilda landmark with its tall tower, built on Grey Street in 1890 is another church by Reed in partnership with Henderson &amp; Smart architects.

===Events and festivals===

St Kilda is home to many major annual events. The largest of these is the St Kilda Festival. Hailed as Australia&#x27;s Largest Free Music Festival the one-day event features live music, dance performances, community activities, carnival rides, street performances, market and food stalls, and a dedicated children&#x27;s area. Since the first St Kilda Festival in 1980 the event has grown in scale and now attracts over half a million visitors each year. St Kilda also hosts the annual gay Pride March, which starts at Lakeside Drive and heads down Fitzroy Street to the Catani Gardens. The St Kilda Short Film Festival is Australia&#x27;s longest running short film festival and has been showcasing Australian short films since 1983. The week-long event kicks off with a star-studded Opening Night at St Kilda&#x27;s Palais Theatre each year. St Kilda is also home to the many venues of the Melbourne Underground Film Festival. Until 2009, St Kilda was home to the Community Cup festival which celebrates grassroots Australian rules football having attracted record attendances of up to 23,000 and raising money for local charity the Sacred Heart Mission. A similar annual celebrity cricket match known as Batting for the Battlers is played at the Peanut Farm opposite Luna Park and attracts a crowd of up to 2,000. Other local events include the St Kilda Film Festival and St Kilda Writers Festival. St Kilda even has its own, locally organised TEDx event TEDxStKilda, which is based on the TED format and ideals.

St Kilda has run Melbourne&#x27;s first major arts and crafts market which has been run on the Esplanade every Sunday since the 1980s. It has been rivalled in Melbourne in recent years by the Southbank art and craft market on Southbank promenade.

===Music===

St Kilda has a vibrant music scene that has produced many notable bands and artists. During the late 1970s, it became a hotbed of dark, noisy post-punk, pioneered by locals bands The Birthday Party (featuring Nick Cave and Rowland S. Howard), The Moodists and Crime &amp; the City Solution. These and other groups such as Hunters &amp; Collectors regularly played at the Crystal Ballroom, one of the city&#x27;s most iconic venues. Paul Kelly, Tex Perkins, Fred Negro, and dozens of other independent musicians have also called St Kilda home at some point. Prominent local music venues include the Palais Theatre for larger concerts, the Esplanade Hotel (commonly known as &quot;The Espy&quot;), the Prince of Wales Hotel for larger gigs and DJ&#x27;s (and backpackers), The George Public Bar on Saturday afternoons, and the St Kilda Bowls Club.

===Sport===


St Kilda has very strong historical links with Australian rules football. The St Kilda Football Club, nicknamed the Saints, formed in 1873, and currently competes in the national Australian Football League (AFL). Originally based locally at Junction Oval, the team has played its home games at several venues outside St Kilda since 1965. Its current home ground is Docklands Stadium. The St Kilda City Football Club of the Southern Football League is based at the Peanut Farm. St Kilda also has Women&#x27;s Australian rules football team, the St Kilda Sharks, who won back-to-back Victorian Women&#x27;s Football League titles in 1998&amp;99. Albert Park and Lake reserve has a number of ovals which are home to Australian rules football clubs. These include the historic Junction Oval which has in the past been a prominent VFL/AFL venue and more recently a training facility for the Melbourne Football Club. Several amateur VAFA clubs also use the park for their home grounds including the Collegians Football Club (Harry Trott Oval), Powerhouse Football Club (Ross Gregory Oval) and Old Melburnians (Junction Oval) are based in the St Kilda section of Albert Park. The Community Cup was a community Australian rules event, run for 14 years by the local Sacred Heart Mission, which until 2007 drew crowds of up to 23,000 spectators.

St Kilda also has a strong cricket presence. The Junction Oval is home to the St Kilda Cricket Club and occasionally the Victorian Bushrangers Cricket Club and was the debut venue of Shane Warne. St Kilda has a wide range of other minor sports including the Collegians-X hockey club, the St Kilda baseball club, an ultimate disc club, and several social soccer clubs.

St Kilda has a Lawn Bowls scene which attracts younger players and has been popularised in film and television. The St Kilda Lawn Bowls Club on Fitzroy Street has a long history and retains its heritage clubhouse building as well as hosts many community events.

Many of the open water events of the 2007 World Aquatics Championships were held at St Kilda beach. The 2006 Commonwealth Games triathlon and cycling time trials were held along the foreshore, and the marathon passed through some of St Kilda&#x27;s main streets. The annual Melbourne Marathon also passes through St Kilda. St Kilda Beach is regularly used for state and international beach volleyball tournaments.

===Recreation and leisure===
Recreation on St Kilda West and Middle Park beaches includes most watersports, including windsurfing, sailing, kitesurfing, rollerblading, beach volleyball, diving, jetskiing, waterskiing, sunbathing and skydiving with Skydive the Beach Melbourne. A skate park for the Fitzroy street end of Albert Park is in the planning stages as well as the existing skate park on Marine Parade.

==Built environment==
===Local landmarks===
St Kilda has many distinctive local landmarks, most centred on the St Kilda Esplanade and foreshore area, several featuring domes of a Moorish architecture theme established at the turn of the century. Perhaps the best known is Luna Park an early-20th century amusement park with its &quot;Moonface&quot; entry and its historic scenic railway.

The St Kilda Pier is another local landmark and major tourist attraction. The pier is terminated by the St Kilda Pavilion, an Edwardian building in the mould of English pier pavilions which is considered of high cultural importance to Melbournians. It was reconstructed and listed on the Victorian Heritage Register after burning down. The pier has a long breakwater which shelters St Kilda Harbour and hosts a little penguin colony.

St Kilda Beach, with gentle bay waves, is popular with swimmers and sunbathers during the summer months. As with most metropolitan beaches near the mouth of the Yarra, however, it has poor water quality.

The St Kilda Sea Baths was a Moorish-themed building constructed in the late 1920s and demolished in the 1990s, leaving only the two turrets. After much delay, after the original developer Hannah Friedman ran out of money, it was redeveloped to resemble in a small way the original style and continues a history of sea baths in St Kilda which dates back to the 1850s. Sometime referred to as &quot;Chadstone by the Sea&quot; (Chadstone being a huge shopping mall).

Acland Street is a shopping and restaurant precinct with numerous cake shops and cafes. It also features a number of public artworks. It is now a dead-end street, with a tram stop and plaza blocking it at Barkly Street.

St Kilda Town Hall is a building originally by William Pitt. It was burnt down in the 1980s and the interior has been extensively redesigned. Directly opposite is the St Kilda Public Library, built between 1971 and 1973 at 150 Carlisle Street. This is a brutalist design by architect Enrico Taglietti, designed to open like a book; it also includes Ashton Raggatt McDougall&#x27;s award-winning extension (1994).

===Residential architecture===
With many layers of development, St Kilda is characterised by an eclectic mix of residential styles, ranging from rows of Victorian terrace houses, Edwardian and interwar homes and apartments to post-war and modern infill development. Much of St Kilda&#x27;s innovative architecture is recognised nationally.

St Kilda is home to many &quot;boom style&quot; mansions, dating back to the early days of the seaside resort. Historic residences include Eildon Mansion on Grey Street built in 1855 (later modified) to the design of Reed and Barnes is a significant grand old mansion. Hewison House, built at 25 Chapel Street in 1869, is a former mansion that has become an administration building of St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School. Marion Terrace in Burnett Street was built in 1883 and is considered one of the finest Second Empire styled terrace houses in Australia. Myrnong Hall built in 1890 on Acland Street is a large Victorian mansion richly decorated in cast iron.

Edwardian buildings include The Priory, built in 1890 at 61 Alma Road, it is one of the few Richardsonian Romanesque homes in Melbourne, built as the boarding house for a ladies&#x27; school, but now a private residence.

During the interwar years St Kilda was heavily subdivided into apartments. This era produced some outstanding early apartment designs, including Majestic Mansions on Fitzroy Street (1912). Tompkins is a mixture of Edwardian styles and are some of the earliest self-contained flats in Melbourne. Summerland Mansions built in 1920 on Fitzroy Street is another block in the &quot;mansion flats&quot; style, a style rare in Melbourne. Belmont Flats on the corner of Alma Road and Chapel Street was built in 1923, an outstanding blend of Arts and Crafts and Californian Bungalow influences applied to an apartment building, was built in 1923. Belvedere Flats at 22 Esplanade on the corner of Robe Street was built in 1929 and is a Spanish Mission styled block of flats designed by William H. Merritt and has featured on &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;. All of these buildings are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. A significant block of Spanish Mission flats, the Baymor Court, built in 1929 was demolished in November 2004 to make way for the Esplanade high-rise apartment development.

Edgewater Towers, completed in 1961, was Melbourne&#x27;s first privately developed high-rise block and the tallest in Victoria.

St Kilda is also home to some contemporary residential designs. St Leonards Apartments in St Leonards Street is two blocks of post-modern apartments, built in 1996 to the design of Nonda Katsalidis, and is recognised with multiple RAIA Victorian Architecture Awards.

===Historic hotel buildings===

St Kilda features many grand old hotels, some which still operate as licensed premises and others that function as accommodation, most of which are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. These include the Esplanade Hotel on the Esplanade. Built in 1878 and later modified, the Esplanade is a pub and live music venue known by locals as the &#x27;Espy&#x27;. The St Kilda Coffee Palace, built in the 1870s was once the St Kilda&#x27;s main coffee palace. It is now a hostel. The George Hotel was built in 1887 on the corner of Fitzroy and Grey streets. From 1979 to the mid 1980s the &quot;Crystal Ballroom&quot; at the George (briefly the Seaview Hotel) became a punk music venue, launching artists such as Nick Cave, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Models and many more. In the 1990s, it was converted into studio apartments. More recently, the ground floor has been renovated and is now a function venue, nightclub and bar called The George Whitebar and Gallery. The Prince of Wales Hotel was built in 1940 in the moderne style on the site of the first Prince of Wales which was built in 1920. It has been used as a cabaret venue and is now another live music venue.

===Parks and gardens===
St Kilda is known for its many parks and gardens, many featuring combinations of the predominant Canary Island date palms, which are synonymous with the area and Californian fan palms. Some of the gardens include St Kilda Botanic Gardens on Blessington Street, which has heritage features and gates, a conservatory, rose garden, lake and a sustainable Eco Centre building. The gardens were once surrounded by mansions, but were subject to unit development in the 1960s. The St Kilda Foreshore and Catani Arch are on Jacka Boulevard, while the upper Esplanade reserve where the Sunday markets are held features the Catani Clock Tower, heritage toilets and vaults. The Catani Gardens which sit between the foreshore, Beaconsfield Parade and the Esplanade includes a War Memorial, Captain Cook statue and Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron Buildings. O&#x27;Donnell Gardens is adjacent to Luna Park on Acland Street and features an art-deco monument and tall palms. Alfred Square on the upper Esplanade has numerous war memorials, which include the South African War Memorial (1905) listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Albert Park is a large park which spans many suburbs, including St Kilda on Fitzroy Street and hosts a number of sporting fields and a recreational lake. The St Kilda Town Hall features a small public Victorian garden facing the corner of Brighton Road and Carlisle Street.
St Kilda is also home to one of Melbourne&#x27;s few remaining Indigenous Australian landmarks, the Corroboree Tree. The red gum eucalyptus, estimated at being between four and seven hundred years old, is located next to Queens Road, close to the junction with Fitzroy Street. A plaque close to its base reads &quot;Aboriginals of early settlement days congregated and held their ceremonies under and in the vicinity of this tree&quot;. These ceremonies celebrated important events, told traditional stories and promoted unity between communities, and are commonly known by the generic term &quot;corroboree&quot;, or &quot;ngargee&quot; in the local language. The site continued to be used, both for ceremonial purposes and as a fringe camp, for some years after British settlement in 1835, as is evidenced by Jacob Miller who told his son how he had witnessed the remnant Kulin population &quot;perform their dancing about the old tree&quot; after moving into the area during the 1850s.

The &quot;Veg Out&quot; Community Gardens, at the former St Kilda Bowling Club in the Peanut Farm reserve, form another public garden. The gardens are primarily rented by residents of apartments in the area and offer local residents the opportunity to express themselves in a small plot of dirt, which results in many colourful artistic displays.

==Education and schools==
St Kilda is home to several schools, including secondary schools St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School, St Mary&#x27;s College and primary schools St Kilda Primary School (on Brighton Road) and St Kilda Park Primary School (on Fitzroy Street) all of which have imposing heritage buildings on campus.

Former schools include

The main characters were often depicted playing social games of soccer in Catani Gardens and social lawn bowls at St Kilda bowls club, both of which have since become local traditions. The show featured a fictional pub called the Foo Bar which was often sought after by tourists but did not actually exist. The popularity of the name later inspired a real licensed venue in nearby beachside Brighton. St Kilda was also the venue for &quot;My Restaurant Rules&quot; 2004 series, with the Melbourne restaurant &quot;Seven Stones&quot;.

<text>The Laura Recovery Center (LRC) is a non-profit organization that worked to prevent kidnappings and abductions and to recover victims of such events. The center was located in Friendswood, Texas, and was named for Laura Kate Smither (April 23, 1984 – April 3, 1997), a 12-year-old girl who was abducted near her Friendswood home and murdered.

==History==
The center was established by Smither&#x27;s parents, Bob and Gay Smither, in April 1998 in response to their daughter&#x27;s murder. On April 3, 1997, Laura Smither was abducted near her home while she was jogging. After her disappearance, more than 6,000 volunteers searched over 800 square miles (2,000 km2). Her body was discovered seventeen days later, on April 20, in a regional water retention pond ten miles from her home. In 2016, William Lewis Reece was indicted on charges of murdering Smither, and other missing Texas girls, and in 2022 he was sentenced to life in prison. He had previously been sentenced to death for the murder of Tiffany Johnston in Oklahoma.

<text>Barend &quot;Ben&quot; Bril (16 July 1912 – 11 September 2003) was a Dutch boxer who competed in the 1928 Amsterdam Summer Olympics in Flyweight boxing, and became an accomplished European boxing referee and judge in the 1960s.

==Early life and career==
Bril was born in Valkenburgstraat, a poor section of Amsterdam to Jewish parents Abraham Bril and Klaartie Moffie on 16 July 1912. He was one of six children of a struggling family supported primarily by their father&#x27;s work as a fisherman. Bril competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics at age 15 in his home town, finishing fifth in the flyweight class, just out of medal contention. In his Olympic competition, after a first round bye, he defeated Myles McDonagh of Ireland, before losing to Buddy Lebanon of South Africa.

Four years later he was barred from the 1932 Summer Olympics because the Dutch Olympic Committee was led by a member of the Dutch Nazi party. He later boycotted the 1936 Games in Berlin.

In his boxing career before the war, beginning in 1928, he won the Dutch Amateur National Championship a total of eight times. As a high point in his amateur career, he won a gold medal at the 1935 Maccabiah Games, held in Tel Aviv, Israel.

==Internment at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp==
During the German occupation of the Netherlands after 1940, Bril, his wife Celia and son were forced to go into hiding above what was once his family&#x27;s bakery, but in 1942 were arrested by Nazi sympathiser, Jan Olij a neighbor, whose father, Sam Olij, had boxed together with Bril in the 1928 Olympics. Around 1942, he was first sent to the Vught Transit Camp, a concentration camp in Southern Holland with deplorable conditions, located Southeast of his home in Amsterdam. Once deported to Northern Germany and interned at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Bril was able to get a job, and then a promotion to the position of Blockälteste, which put him in charge of his barrack. Looking to survive, he was selected to box in the camp, where he let known German boxers defeat him. Four of his brothers and a sister died in the camps. All but one of the siblings were married with children. Ben, his wife, and his younger brother Herrie survived the war. Herrie Bril died in Rotterdam on 6 August 1966. Sam Olij was eventually jailed and died in the Netherlands in 1975, while Jan fled to Argentina and died there in 1996.

==Work as a referee==
From 1963-74, Bril found fame working as a boxing referee for many important matches throughout Europe. Most of the fights he refereed were title fights for the European Boxing Union, that brought him to matches in Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, Paris, London, and throughout Europe. Bril also refereed Olympic fights, overseeing the matches of George Frazier at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, George Foreman at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and for Teófilo Stevenson a Cuban heavyweight, who competed in boxing in three Summer Olympics from 1972-1980. He also refereed boxing matches for the 1973 Maccabiah Games.

Bril and his wife Celia had one child Ab Ben, who lives in Zandvoort with his wife Wilma. Ab Ben and Wilma have one son, Benno, who also lives in Zandvoort.

Bril died on 11 September 2003, at the age of 91 at the Beth Shalom Retirement Home in Amsterdam, and was buried at the Jewish cemetery of Muiderberg. He is still considered an heroic figure in the Netherlands. After his death, the Ben Bril Memorial Boxing Gala, which continues today, was inaugurated to honor his memory. The event features a series of boxing matches and is held every October in Amsterdam.

In October 2006 Bril&#x27;s biography &quot;Ben Bril - Davidsster als Ereteken&quot;, by Ed van Opzeeland was published. The English translation of the title is &quot;Ben Bril - Decorated with a Star of David&quot;. The Dutch swimmer Erica Terpstra handed out the first copy of the book to Ben&#x27;s only son Albert Bril.

<doc id="317605" wikidata="Q2469176" url="?curid=317605" title="Brandy Alexander">
<text>A Brandy Alexander is a brandy-based dessert cocktail, consisting of cognac, crème de cacao, and cream, that became popular during the early 20th century. It is a variation of an earlier, gin-based cocktail called simply an Alexander. The cocktail known as Alexander today may contain gin or brandy. Ice cream can be added for a &quot;frozen Brandy Alexander&quot;.

== History ==
There are many rumours about the origins of the cocktail. Some sources say it was created at the time of the London wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles in 1922. Drama critic and Algonquin Round Table member Alexander Woollcott said it was named after him. Other sources say it was named after the Russian tsar Alexander II.

The drink was possibly named after Troy Alexander, a bartender at Rector&#x27;s, a New York City restaurant, who created the drink in order to serve a white drink at a dinner celebrating Phoebe Snow, a character in a popular advertising campaign in the early 20th century.

John Lennon was introduced to it on March 12, 1974, by Harry Nilsson, on Lennon&#x27;s so-called &quot;lost weekend&quot;. The pair began heckling the Smothers Brothers, and whilst being ejected Lennon allegedly assaulted a waitress. Lennon later said the drinks &quot;tasted like milkshakes&quot;.

==In film and television==

In the 1962 film &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, alcoholic Joe Clay, played by Jack Lemmon, takes Kirsten Arnesen, played by Lee Remick, out on a date. When she explains that she dislikes liquor but likes chocolate, he orders her a Brandy Alexander. This begins Kirsten&#x27;s descent into alcoholism.

In the 1970 pilot of the television series, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, the namesake character adds to a running gag by asking for a Brandy Alexander during a job interview.

In the 1981 film &quot;Tattoo&quot;, Bruce Dern takes Maud Adams out for dinner and orders a Brandy Alexander. When she comments that he does not look the Brandy Alexander type, he replies, &quot;I like the foam...it reminds me of the ocean.&quot;

In the 1981 television adaptation of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; (discussed below), Anthony Blanche (Nickolas Grace) takes Charles Ryder (Jeremy Irons) out for drinks, ordering four Brandy Alexanders for the two of them: &quot;I expect you would prefer sherry, but my dear Charles, you&#x27;re not going to have sherry tonight. You&#x27;re going to try this delicious concoction instead.&quot; When Charles reacts hesitantly to his first sip, Anthony proceeds to drink all four cocktails in rapid succession.

In the 2008 James Gray movie &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow) tells Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) she drinks Brandy Alexanders with her boyfriend Ronald, a rich lawyer. Leonard orders one at a restaurant to impress her, but ruins the effect by mistaking the stirrer for a straw.

==In print==
The character Brandy Alexander in the novel &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot; by Chuck Palahniuk is named after the drink.

Anthony Blanche orders four &quot;Alexandra cocktails&quot; in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. Christian Kracht repeats the four Brandy Alexanders motif in his 1995 novel &quot;Faserland&quot;.
In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s book, &quot;Mother Night&quot;, the protagonist suspects that an overly flattering article in the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; about his neighbor was &quot;written by a pansy full of Brandy Alexanders.&quot;

Tibetan music is mostly religious music, reflecting the influence of Tibetan Buddhism.&quot;With influence from Tibet, this Nepalese music is characterized by unison singing and occasional accompaniment on the &quot;damian&quot;, a stringed instrument in the lute family that provides a strong rhythmic base. The musicians generally sing in Helambu (a Sherpa-Tibetan dialect) and sometimes in Tibetan on themes of religion, a desire for material wealth, the natural landscape, and a “sense of an ordered world in contrast to the nomadic pattern of many peoples’ lives” (Bishop). Liner notes include a description of the village and its music, track notes, and lyrics in Helambu/Tibetan and English&quot;.

===Tharu music===
Tharu music is also one of the ancient types of music still played in Nepal. Tharu music is very diverse within itself as Tharus from various parts of nepal do not share the same Tharu language. The Tharu people sing songs like Sajana, Maghiya, and Dashainya mostly in the western parts of Nepal.

===Bhajan===
A bhajan is a devotional song praising and sometimes calling upon the Gods. It has no fixed form; it may be as simple as a mantra or kirtan. It is usually lyrical, expressing love and prayer for the Divine. Shiva, Krishna, Vishnu and Sai Baba bhajans are popular in Nepal. Notable Bhajan singers Bhakta Raj Acharya, Koili Devi Mathema.

===Filmi music===
Filmi music is popular in Nepal and produced for mainstream motion pictures. Cinema in Nepal has a short history hence filmi music is still evolving.

===Gazal===
The Gazal is a poetic form of music consisting of rhyming couplets and a refrain, with each line sharing the same meter. A gazal may be understood as a poetic expression of pain, loss and separation, beauty of love and nature. It is a delicate form of poetry and music. The form is ancient, originating in 6th-century Arabic verse. Gazals spread into South Asia in the 12th century owing to the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate in India and South Asia. Although the gazal is a form of Dari and Urdu poetry, its influence can be seen in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent. Motiram Bhatta introduced the written form of gazal in Nepali language circa 1890. Seturam Shrestha (1891-1941) has been credited with pioneering gazals in Nepal.

== Other influences ==

Like other parts of the world, Nepal too had its share of modern influences and representations. The impact of these influences poses a risk to Nepalese folk music. As a result, there is a growing number of startups like Baja Nepal and other local initiatives that are emerging to encourage the conservation of folk music.

<doc id="317619" wikidata="Q5641788" url="?curid=317619" title="Half and half">
<text>&quot;Half and half&quot; is the name of various beverages and foods made of an equal-parts mixture of two substances, including dairy products, alcoholic beverages, and soft drinks.

== Alcoholic beverages ==
=== Belgium ===
In some cafés in Brussels, a &quot;half en half&quot;, Dutch for &quot;half and half&quot;, is a mixture of white wine and champagne. Originally, it was a mixture of two different typical beer types from Brussels: 50% lambic and 50% faro.

=== Denmark ===
If you order a &quot;half and half&quot; in a Copenhagen bar, you will get a mixture of dark beer and pilsner (lager). The dark beer is a Danish version of an Imperial stout-type beer; in Denmark simply called &quot;porter&quot;, which is a little sweeter than a Guinness.

=== Ireland, England and North America ===

In Britain, a half and half may mean a mixture of mild ale and bitter.

In the North East of England, a request for a half and half would more commonly produce a combination of Scotch ale and India pale ale (IPA). This drink fell from favour when the Scottish &amp; Newcastle brewery were obliged to sell many of their tied public houses and McEwan&#x27;s Scotch and IPA disappeared from public bars across the North East.

In Canada and the United States, &quot;Black and Tan&quot; refers to Guinness and a lager or ale that will support the Guinness, most commonly Bass Ale, although some Irish-themed bars shun the term for its association with the Royal Irish Constabulary&#x27;s &quot;Black and Tans&quot; force. A &quot;Half and Half&quot; is Guinness and Harp. A Guinness and Smithwick&#x27;s is a &quot;Blacksmith&quot;.

=== Scotland ===

In Scotland, a &quot;hauf an a hauf&quot; (half and a half) is a &quot;wee hauf&quot; glass of whisky () and of beer as a chaser.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia ===
&quot;Pola pola&quot; (&quot;half and half&quot;) is a slang term for the drink spritzer, made out of equal parts of white wine or rosé wine and carbonated water. Different ratios of wine and carbonated water are named with various slang terms, depending on the region. &quot;Pola pola&quot; is also known as &quot;litra i voda&quot; (one bottle of wine and one bottle of carbonated water), as well as &quot;Litar-litar&quot; (as in 1 liter of wine, 1 liter of water) and &quot;Gemišt&quot;.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, and more particularly in Valais, a half &amp; half is a mixture of dry and sweet liquor of the same fruit. In the canton of Geneva, a &quot;moitié-moitié&quot; generally refers to a digestif containing one half Williamine liqueur and one half Williamine eau-de-vie. In the canton of Ticino, a &quot;mezz e mezz&quot; (literally &quot;half and half&quot; in the local Ticinese dialect) refers to a mixture of one half local Merlot wine and one half gazosa (a local lemon-flavoured carbonated soft drink).

=== Uruguay ===
In Uruguay there&#x27;s a beverage called &quot;Medio y Medio&quot; (&quot;half and half&quot;) that consists of sweet sparkling wine and dry white wine in equal parts. &quot;Medio y medio&quot; comes in Red, Rosé and White varieties, the latter being the original and most popular. It is massively consumed during the holidays but it can be found in certain places throughout the year as well. The most common &quot;Medio y Medio&quot; is the one produced by Roldós, a local restaurant that claims having invented the mixture.

&quot;Medio y medio&quot; is also the name for another cocktail, made with White Vermouth and &quot;Caña&quot; (literally &quot;cane&quot;), a 35–50% alcoholic beverage distilled from sugar cane. This name, however, is used not in the majority of bars but only in the most traditional ones, probably due to the existence of Roldós&#x27; &quot;Medio y Medio&quot;.

== Non-alcoholic beverages ==
The Arnold Palmer, also known as a half and half, is popular in the Northeastern United States. The drink consists of 1 part lemonade and 1 part iced tea; variations may include a mixture of sweet and unsweetened tea. In the Southern United States (specifically the cities of Atlanta, Baltimore, and Houston), &quot;half and half&quot; may also refer to a mixture of half sweet, half unsweetened tea. Some coffee shops in colder climates serve a half and half drink consisting of half coffee and half hot chocolate, similar to caffè mocha. Half &amp; Half might also refer to a flavor of soda that combines the flavors of grapefruit and lemon.

=== Canada and the United States ===
In Canada and the United States, &quot;half and half&quot; almost always refers to a light cream typically used in coffee. (See below.) The name refers to the liquid&#x27;s content of half milk and half cream. It is widely available in the United States, both in individual-serving containers and in bulk. It is also used to make ice cream. Non-fat versions of the product are also available, containing corn syrup and other ingredients.

=== Switzerland ===
In the Romandy, a &quot;moitié-moitié&quot; (lit. &quot;half-half&quot;) can refer to coffee mixed with an equal amount of milk..

In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, especially in the north-eastern part, a mixture of apple and orange juice is known as &quot;halb halb&quot; (&quot;half half&quot;, sometimes written 1+1).

== Dairy product ==

&quot;Half and half&quot; or &quot;Half-and-half&quot; is a mixture of milk and cream, which is often used in coffee and with breakfast cereals. In the United States, half and half is a common liquid product produced by dairy companies in premixed form. It was invented by William A. Boutwell of Boutwell Dairy in Lake Worth Beach, Florida, which distributed the blend regionally between 1927 and 1956.

In the United States, half-and-half must contain between 10.5 and 18 percent milkfat. It is pasteurized or ultra-pasteurized, and may be homogenized.

The following optional ingredients may also be used:
#Emulsifiers
#Stabilizers
#Nutritive sweeteners
#Characterizing flavoring ingredients (with or without coloring) as follows:
##Fruit and fruit juice (including concentrated fruit and fruit juice).
##Natural and artificial food flavoring.

=== Milkette ===

A milkette (also referred to as dairy milker, creamette or creamers) is a single serving of milk (2%) or cream (10% and 18%) in or containers used for coffee and tea.

The single cup of milk is stored in a sealed (foil cover) plastic cup of milk or cream with long shelf life but must be refrigerated.

== Food ==

===Netherlands===
&quot;Half-om-halfgehakt&quot; (half for half minced meat) is commonly used for mixed minced meat, made of equal amounts of beef and pork. The term &quot;Gehacktes halb und halb&quot; is used in Germany, also referring to minced meat.

===Switzerland===
&quot;Moitié-moitié&quot; (lit. &quot;half-half&quot;) refers to a cheese fondue made with half &quot;Gruyère&quot; and half &quot;Vacherin Fribourgeois&quot;.

===Sweden===
In the Skaraborg region of Sweden &quot;Hälta Hälta&quot; (&quot;Half Half&quot; in the local dialect) refers to a serving of half french fries and half mashed potato, commonly served with sausage. 

===United States===

Black and white cookies are sometimes called half-and-half cookies

A half-and-half pizza is one prepared with different toppings on each side of the pizza.

===British Isles===
A half and half is commonly understood to be a side dish of half chips and half rice. The term is used across the British Isles but most commonly in the north of England and Wales. A typical order might be &quot;chicken curry half and half&quot; or &quot;chili con carne half and half&quot;.

<text>An image scanner (often abbreviated to just scanner) is a device that optically scans images, printed text, handwriting, or an object and converts it to a digital image. The most common type of scanner used in the home and the office is the flatbed scanner, where the document is placed on a glass bed. A sheetfed scanner, which moves the page across an image sensor using a series of rollers, may be used to scan one page of a document at a time or multiple pages, as in an automatic document feeder. A handheld scanner is a portable version of an image scanner that can be used on any flat surface. Scans are typically downloaded to the computer that the scanner is connected to, although some scanners are able to store scans on standalone flash media (e.g., memory cards and USB drives).

Modern scanners typically use a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a contact image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. Document cameras, which use commodity or specialized high-resolution cameras, photograph documents all at once.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===

Image scanners are considered the successors of early facsimile (fax) machines. The earliest attempt at a fax machine was patented in 1843 by the Scottish clockmaker Alexander Bain but never put into production. In his design, a metal stylus linked to a pendulum scans across a copper plate with a raised image. When the stylus makes contact with a raised part of the plate, it sends a pulse across a pair of wires to a receiver containing an electrode linked to another pendulum. A piece of paper impregnated with an electrochemically sensitive solution resides underneath the electrode and changes color whenever a pulse reaches the electrode. A gear advances the copper plate and paper in tandem with each swing of the pendulum; over time, the result is a perfect reproduction of the copper plate. In Bain&#x27;s system, it is critical that the pendulums of the transceiver and receiver are in perfect step, or else the reproduced image will be distorted.

In 1847, the English physicist Frederick Bakewell developed the first working fax machine. Bakewell&#x27;s machine was similar to Bain&#x27;s but used a revolving drum coated in tinfoil, with non-conductive ink painted on the foil and a stylus that scans across the drum and sends a pulse down a pair of wires when it contacts a conductive point on the foil. The receiver contains an electrode that touches a sheet of chemically treated paper, which changes color when the electrode receives a pulse; the result is a reverse contrast (white-on-blue) reproduction of the original image. Bakewell&#x27;s fax machine was marginally more successful than Bain&#x27;s but suffered from the same synchronization issues. In 1862, Giovanni Caselli solved this with the pantelegraph, the first fax machine put into regular service. Largely based on Bain&#x27;s design, it ensured complete synchronization by flanking the pendulums of both the transceiver and receiver between two magnetic regulators, which become magnetized with each swing of the pendulum and become demagnetized when the pendulum reaches the maxima and minima of each oscillation.

In 1893, the American engineer Elisha Gray introduced the telautograph, the first widely commercially successful fax machine that used linkage bars translating &quot;x&quot;- and &quot;y&quot;-axis motion at the receiver to scan a pen across the paper and strike it only when actuated by the stylus moving across the transceiver drum. Because it could use commodity stationery paper, it became popular in business and hospitals. In 1902, the German engineer Arthur Korn introduced the phototelautograph, a fax machine that used a light-sensitive selenium cell to scan a paper to be copied, instead of relying on a metallic drum and stylus. It was even more commercially successful than Gray&#x27;s machine and became the basis for telephotography machines used by newspapers around the world from the early 1900s onward.

===Analog era===
Alexander Murray and Richard Morse invented and patented the first analog color scanner at Eastman Kodak in 1937. Intended for color separation at printing presses, their machine was an analog drum scanner that imaged a color transparency mounted in the drum, with a light source placed underneath the film, and three photocells with red, green, and blue color filters reading each spot on the transparency to translate the image into three electronic signals. In Murray and Morse&#x27;s initial design, the drum was connected to three lathes that etched cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) halftone dots onto three offset cylinders directly. The rights to the patent were sold to Printing Developments Incorporated (P.D.I.) in 1946, who improved on the design by using a photomultiplier tube to image the points on the negative, which produced an amplified signal that was then fed to a single-purpose computer that processed the RGB signals into color-corrected cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) values. The processed signals are then sent to four lathes that etch CMYK halftone dots onto the offset cylinders.

In 1948, Arthur Hardy of the Interchemical Corporation and F. L. Wurzburg of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology invented the first analog, color flatbed image scanner, intended for producing color-corrected lithographic plates from a color negative. In this system, three color-separated plates (of CMY values) are prepared from a color negative via dot etching and placed in the scanner bed. Above each plate are rigidly fixed, equidistant light beam projectors that focus a beam of light onto one corner of the plate. The entire bed with all three plates moves horizontally, back and forth, to reach the opposite corners of the plate; with each horiztonal oscillation of the bed, the bed moves down one step to cover the entire vertical area of the plate. While this is happening, the beam of light focused on a given spot on the plate gets reflected and bounced off to a photocell adjacent to the projector. Each photocell connects to an analog image processor, which evaluates the reflectance of the combined CMY values using Neugebauer equations and outputs a signal to a light projector hovering over a fourth, unexposed lithographic plate. This plate receives a color-corrected, continuous-tone dot-etch of either the cyan, magenta, or yellow values. The fourth plate is replaced with another unexposed plate, and the process repeats until three color-corrected plates, of cyan, magenta and yellow, are produced. In the 1950s, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) took Hardy and Wurzburg&#x27;s patent and replaced the projector-and-photocell arrangement with a video camera tube focusing on one spot of the plate.

=== Digital era ===
The first digital imaging system was the Bartlane system in 1920. Named after the pair who invented it, Harry G. Bartholomew and Maynard D. McFarlane, the Bartlane system used zinc plates etched with an image from a film negative projected at five different exposure levels to correspond to five quantization levels. All five plates are affixed to a long, motor-driven rotating cylinder, with five equidistant contacts scanning over each plate at the same starting position. The Bartlane system was initially used exclusively by telegraph, with the five-bit Baudot code used to transmit the grayscale digital image. In 1921, the system was modified for offline use, with a five-bit paper tape punch punching holes depending on whether its connections to the contacts are bridged or not. The result was a stored digital image with five gray levels. Reproduction of the image was achieved with a lamp passing over the punched holes, exposing five different intensities of light onto a film negative.

The first scanner to store its images digitally onto a computer was a drum scanner built in 1957 at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, later NIST) by a team led by Russell A. Kirsch. It used a photomultiplier tube to detect light at a given point and produced an amplified signal that a computer could read and store into memory. The computer of choice at the time was the SEAC mainframe; the maximum horizontal resolution that the SEAC was capable of processing was 176 pixels. The first image ever scanned on this machine was a photograph of Kirsch&#x27;s three-month-old son, Walden.

In 1969, Dacom introduced the 111 fax machine, which was the first digital fax machine to employ data compression using an on-board computer. It employed a flatbed design with a continuous feed capable of scanning up to letter paper in 1-bit monochrome (black and white).

The first flatbed scanner used for digital image processing was the Autokon 8400, introduced by ECRM Inc., a subsidiary of AM International, in 1975. The Autokon 8400 used a laser beam to scan pages up to 11 by 14 inches at a maximum resolution of 1000 lines per inch. Although it was only capable of scanning in 1-bit monochrome, the on-board processor was capable of halftoning, unsharp masking, contrast adjustment, and anamorphic distortions, among other features. The Autokon 8400 could either be connected to a film recorder to create a negative for producing plates or connected to a mainframe or minicomputer for further image processing and digital storage. The Autokon 8400 enjoyed widespread use in newspapers—ECRM shipped 1,000 units to newspaper publishers by 1985—but its limited resolution and maximum scan size made it unsuitable for commercial printing. In 1982, ECRM introduced the Autokon 8500, capable of scanning up to 1200 lines per inch. Four of ECRM&#x27;s competitors introduced commercial flatbed scanners that year, including Scitex, Agfa-Gevaert, and Linotype-Hell, all of which were capable of scanning larger prints at higher resolutions. ECRM introduced the Autokon 1000DE in 1985 to address the shortcomings of the Autokon 8400/8500. The 1000DE (digital enhancement) used a microprocessor to produce the sharpening effect as against the 8400 which used analogue electronics and an optical method to create sharpening. The Autokon 1000DE had a touchpad rather than analogue rotary controls. The Autokon 1000DE had applications in both commercial and newspaper environments where only a single halftone was required ie black and white. Whilst typically the Autokon 8400 was a standalone output device that scanned and then output to either photosensitive, roll format bromide paper or film, the Autokon 1000DE was often connected to Apple Macintoshes or PCs via a dedicated interface such as those from HighWater Designs. The last Autokon was a wider format, online only device which utilised both a red and green laser to improve the response to the scanning of colour photographs.

In 1977, Raymond Kurzweil, of his start-up company Kurzweil Computer Products, released the Kurzweil Reading Machine, which was the first flatbed scanner with a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging element. The Kurzweil Reading Machine was invented to assist blind people in reading books that had not been translated to braille. It comprised the image scanner and a Data General Nova minicomputer—the latter performing the image processing, optical character recognition (OCR), and speech synthesis.

The first scanners for personal computers appeared in the mid-1980s, starting with ThunderScan for the Macintosh in December 1984. Designed by Andy Hertzfeld and released by Thunderware Inc., the ThunderScan contains a specialized image sensor built into a plastic housing the same shape as the ink ribbon cartridge of Apple&#x27;s ImageWriter printer. The ThunderScan slots into the ImageWriter&#x27;s ribbon carrier and connects to both the ImageWriter and the Macintosh simultaneously. The ImageWriter&#x27;s carriage, controlled by the ThunderScan, moves left-to-right to scan one 200-dpi (dots per inch) line at a time, with the carriage return serving to advance the scanner down the print to be scanned. The ThunderScan was the Macintosh&#x27;s first scanner and sold well but operated very slowly and was only capable of scanning prints at 1-bit monochrome. In 1999, Canon iterated on this idea with the IS-22, a cartridge that fit into their inkjet printers to convert them into sheetfed scanners.

In early 1985, the first flatbed scanner for the IBM PC, the Datacopy Model 700, was released. Based on a CCD imaging element, the Model 700 was capable of scanning letter-sized documents at a maximum resolution of 200 dpi at 1-bit monochrome. The Model 700 came with a special interface card for connecting to the PC, and an optional, aftermarket OCR software card and software package were sold for the Model 700. In April 1985, LaserFAX Inc. introduced the first CCD-based color flatbed scanner, the SpectraSCAN 200, for the IBM PC. The SpectraSCAN 200 worked by placing color filters over the CCD and taking four passes (three for each primary color and one for black) per scan to build up a color reproduction. The SpectraSCAN 200 took between two and three minutes to produce a scan of a letter-sized print at 200-dpi; its grayscale counterpart, the DS-200, took only 30 seconds to make a scan at the same size and resolution.

The first relatively affordable flatbed scanner for personal computers appeared in February 1987 with Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s ScanJet, which was capable of scanning 4-bit (64-shade) grayscale images at a maximum resolution of 300 dpi. By the beginning of 1988, the ScanJet had accounted for 27 percent of all scanner sales in terms of dollar volume, per Gartner Dataquest. In February 1989, the company introduced the ScanJet Plus, which increased the bit depth to 8 bits (256 shades) while costing only US$200 more than the original ScanJet&#x27;s $1990 (). This led to a massive price drop in grayscale scanners with equivalent or lesser features in the market. The number of third-party developers producing software and hardware supporting these scanners jumped dramatically in turn, effectively popularizing the scanner for the personal computer user. By 1999, the cost of the average color-capable scanner had dropped to $300 (). That year, &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; declared 1999 &quot;the year that scanners finally became a mainstream commodity&quot;.

== Types ==
=== Flatbed ===

A flatbed scanner is a type of scanner that provides a glass bed (platen) on which the object to be scanned lies motionless. The scanning element moves vertically from under the glass, scanning either the entirety of the platen or a predetermined portion. The driver software for most flatbed scanners allows users to prescan their documents—in essence, to take a quick, low-resolution pass at a document in order to judge what area of the document should be scanned (if not the entirety of it), before scanning it at a higher resolution. Some flatbed scanners incorporate sheet-feeding mechanisms called automatic document feeders (ADFs) that use the same scanning element as the flatbed portion.

This type of scanner is sometimes called a &quot;reflective scanner&quot;, because it works by shining white light onto the object to be scanned and reading the intensity and color of light that is reflected from it, usually a line at a time. They are designed for scanning prints or other flat, opaque materials, but some have available transparency adapters, which—for a number of reasons—in most cases, are not very well suited to scanning film.

=== Sheetfed ===

A sheetfed scanner, also known as a document feeder, is a type of scanner that uses motor-driven rollers to move one single sheet of paper at a time past a stationary scanning element (two scanning elements, in the case of scanners with duplex functionality). Unlike flatbed scanners, sheetfed scanners are not equipped to scan bound material such as books or magazines, nor are they suitable for any material thicker than plain printer paper. Some sheetfed scanners, called automatic document feeders (ADFs), are capable of scanning several sheets in one session, although others only accept one page at a time. Some sheetfed scanners are portable, powered by batteries, and have their own storage, eventually transferring stored scans to a computer.

=== Handheld ===

A handheld scanner is a type of scanner that must be manually dragged or gilded by hand across the surface of the object to be scanned. Scanning documents in this manner requires a steady hand, as an uneven scanning rate produces distorted images. Some handheld scanners have an indicator light on the scanner for this purpose, actuating if the user is moving the scanner too fast. They typically have at least one button that starts the scan when pressed; it is held by the user for the duration of the scan. Some other handheld scanners have switches to set the optical resolution, as well as a roller, which generates a clock pulse for synchronization with the computer. Older hand scanners were monochrome, and produced light from an array of green LEDs to illuminate the image; later ones scan in monochrome or color, as desired. A hand scanner may also have a small window through which the document being scanned could be viewed. As hand scanners are much narrower than most normal document or book sizes, software (or the end user) needed to combine several narrow &quot;strips&quot; of scanned documents to produce the finished article.

Inexpensive, portable, battery-powered or USB-powered wand scanners and pen scanners, typically capable of scanning an area as wide as a normal letter and much longer, remain available . Some computer mice can also scan documents.

=== Drum ===
A drum scanner is a type of scanner that uses a clear, motor-driven rotating cylinder (drum) onto which a print, a film negative, a transparency, or any other flat object is taped or otherwise secured. A beam of light either projects past, or reflects off, the material to be scanned onto a series of mirrors, which focus the beam onto the drum scanner&#x27;s photomultiplier tube (PMT). After one revolution, the beam of light moves down a single step. When scanning transparent media, such as negatives, a light beam is directed from within the cylinder onto the media; when scanning opaque items, a light beam from above is reflected off the surface of the media. When only one PMT is present, three passes of the image are required for a full-color RGB scan. When three PMTs are present, only a single pass is required.

The photomultiplier tubes of drum scanners offer superior dynamic range to that of CCD sensors. For this reason, drum scanners can extract more detail from very dark shadow areas of a transparency than flatbed scanners using CCD sensors. The smaller dynamic range of the CCD sensors (versus photomultiplier tubes) can lead to loss of shadow detail, especially when scanning very dense transparency film. Drum scanners are also able to resolve true detail in excess of 10000 dpi, producing higher-resolution scans than any CCD scanner.

=== Overhead ===
An overhead scanner is a type of scanner that places the scanning element in a housing on top of a vertical post, hovering above the document or object to be scanned, which lies stationary on an open-air bed. Chinon Industries patented a specific type of overhead scanner, which uses a rotating mirror to reflect the contents of the bed onto a linear CCD, in 1987. Although very flexible—allowing users to scan not only two-dimensional prints and documents but any 3D object, of any size—the Chinon design required the user to provide uniform illumination of the object to be scanned and was more cumbersome to set up.

A more modern type of overhead scanner is a document camera (also known as a video scanner), which uses a digital camera to capture a document all at once. Most document cameras output live video of the document and are usually reserved for displaying documents to a live audience, but they may also be used as replacements for image scanners, capturing a single frame of the output as an image file. Document cameras may even use the same APIs as scanners when connected to computers. A planetary scanner is a type of very-high-resolution document camera used for capturing certain fragile documents. A book scanner is another kind of document camera, pairing a digital camera with a scanning area defined by a mat to assist in scanning books. Some more advanced models of book scanners project a laser onto the page for calibration and software skew correction.

=== Film ===
A film scanner, also known as a slide scanner or a transparency scanner, is a type of specialized flatbed scanner specifically for scanning film negatives and slides. A typical film scanner works by passing a narrowly focused beam of light through the film and reading the intensity and color of the light that emerges. The lowest-cost dedicated film scanners can be had for less than $50, and they might be sufficient for modest needs. From there they inch up in staggered levels of quality and advanced features upward of five figures.

=== Portable ===

Image scanners are usually used in conjunction with a computer which controls the scanner and stores scans. Small portable scanners, either sheetfed or handheld and operated by batteries and with storage capability, are available for use away from a computer; stored scans can be transferred later. Many can scan both small documents such as business cards and till receipts, as well as letter-sized documents.

=== Software scanners ===
The higher-resolution cameras fitted to some smartphones can produce reasonable quality document scans by taking a photograph with the phone&#x27;s camera and post-processing it with a scanning app, a range of which are available for most phone operating systems, to whiten the background of a page, correct perspective distortion so that the shape of a rectangular document is corrected, convert to black-and-white, etc. Many such apps can scan multiple-page documents with successive camera exposures and output them either as a single file or multiple-page files. Some smartphone scanning apps can save documents directly to online storage locations, such as Dropbox and Evernote, send via email, or fax documents via email-to-fax gateways.

Smartphone scanner apps can be broadly divided into three categories:
# Document scanning apps primarily designed to handle documents and output PDF, and sometimes JPEG, files
# Photo scanning apps that output JPEG files, and have editing functions useful for photo rather than document editing;
# Barcode-like QR code scanning apps that then search the internet for information associated with the code.

== Scanning elements ==
=== Charge-coupled device (CCD) ===

Scanners equipped with charge-coupled device (CCD) scanning elements require a sophisticated series of mirrors and lenses to reproduce an image, but the result of this complexity is a much higher-quality scan. Because CCDs have a much greater depth of field, they are more forgiving when it comes to scanning documents that are difficult to get perfectly flat against the platen (such as bound books).

=== Contact image sensor (CIS) ===
Scanners equipped with contact image sensor (CIS) scanning elements are designed to be in near-direct contact with the document to be scanned and thus do not require the complex optics of CCDs scanners. However, their depth of field is much worse, resulting in blurry scans if the scanned document is not perfectly flush against the platten. Because the sensors require far less power than CCD scanners, CIS scanners are able to be manufactured down to a low cost and are typically much lighter in weight and depth than CCD scanners.

=== Photomultiplier tube (PMT) ===

Scanners equipped with photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are nearly exclusively drum scanners.

== Scan quality ==
Color scanners typically read RGB (red-green-blue) color data from the array. This data is then processed with some proprietary algorithm to correct for different exposure conditions, and sent to the computer via the device&#x27;s input/output interface (usually USB, previous to which was SCSI or bidirectional parallel port in older units).

Color depth varies depending on the scanning array characteristics, but is usually at least 24 bits. High-quality models have 36-48 bits of color depth.

Another qualifying parameter for a scanner is its resolution, measured in pixels per inch (ppi), sometimes more accurately referred to as samples per inch (spi). Instead of using the scanner&#x27;s true optical resolution, the only meaningful parameter, manufacturers like to refer to the interpolated resolution, which is much higher thanks to software interpolation. , a high-end flatbed scanner can scan up to 5400 ppi and drum scanners have an optical resolution of between 3000 and 24000 ppi.

&quot;Effective resolution&quot; refers to the true resolution of a scanner, and is determined by using a resolution test chart. The effective resolution of most all consumer flatbed scanners is considerably lower than the manufactures&#x27; given optical resolution.

Manufacturers often claim interpolated resolutions as high as 19200 ppi; but such numbers carry little meaningful value because the number of possible interpolated pixels is unlimited, and doing so does not increase the level of captured detail.

The size of the file created increases with the square of the resolution; doubling the resolution quadruples the file size. A resolution must be chosen that is within the capabilities of the equipment, preserves sufficient detail, and does not produce a file of excessive size. The file size can be reduced for a given resolution by using &quot;lossy&quot; compression methods such as JPEG, at some cost in quality. If the best possible quality is required lossless compression should be used; reduced-quality files of smaller size can be produced from such an image when required (e.g., image designed to be printed on a full page, and a much smaller file to be displayed as part of a fast-loading web page).

Purity can be diminished by scanner noise, optical flare, poor analog to digital conversion, scratches, dust, Newton&#x27;s rings, out-of-focus sensors, improper scanner operation, and poor software. Drum scanners are said to produce the purest digital representations of the film, followed by high-end film scanners that use the larger Kodak Tri-Linear sensors.

The third important parameter for a scanner is its dynamic range (also known as density range). A high-density range means that the scanner is able to record shadow details and brightness details in one scan. Density of film is measured on a base 10 log scale and varies between 0.0 (transparent) and 5.0, about 16 stops. Density range is the space taken up in the 0 to 5 scale, and Dmin and Dmax denote where the least dense and most dense measurements on a negative or positive film. The density range of negative film is up to 3.6d, while slide film dynamic range is 2.4d. Color negative density range after processing is 2.0d thanks to the compression of the 12 stops into a small density range. Dmax will be the densest on slide film for shadows, and densest on negative film for highlights. Some slide films can have a Dmax close to 4.0d with proper exposure, and so can black-and-white negative film.

Consumer-level flatbed photo scanners have a dynamic range in the 2.0–3.0 range, which can be inadequate for scanning all types of photographic film, as Dmax can be and often is between 3.0d and 4.0d with traditional black-and-white film. Color film compresses its 12 stops of a possible 16 stops (film latitude) into just 2.0d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion. Kodak Vision 3 has 18 stops. So, color-negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners. Because traditional black-and-white film retains the image creating silver after processing, density range can be almost twice that of color film. This makes scanning traditional black-and-white film more difficult and requires a scanner with at least a 3.6d dynamic range, but also a Dmax between 4.0d to 5.0d. High-end (photo lab) flatbed scanners can reach a dynamic range of 3.7, and Dmax around 4.0d. Dedicated film scanners have a dynamic range between 3.0d–4.0d. Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than 2.0d. Drum scanners have a dynamic range of 3.6–4.5.

For scanning film, is a technique used to remove the effects of dust and scratches on images scanned from film; many modern scanners incorporate this feature. It works by scanning the film with infrared light; the dyes in typical color film emulsions are transparent to infrared light, but dust and scratches are not, and block infrared; scanner software can use the visible and infrared information to detect scratches and process the image to greatly reduce their visibility, considering their position, size, shape, and surroundings. Scanner manufacturers usually have their own names attached to this technique. For example, Epson, Minolta, Nikon, Konica Minolta, Microtek, and others use Digital ICE, while Canon uses its own system, FARE (Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement). Plustek uses LaserSoft Imaging iSRD. Some independent software developers design infrared cleaning tools.

By combining full-color imagery with 3D models, modern hand-held scanners are able to completely reproduce objects electronically. The addition of 3D color printers enables accurate miniaturization of these objects, with applications across many industries and professions.

For scanner apps, the scan quality is highly dependent on the quality of the phone camera and on the framing chosen by the user of the app.

== Connectivity ==

Scans must virtually always be transferred from the scanner to a computer or information storage system for further processing or storage. There are two basic issues: (1) how the scanner is physically connected to the computer and (2) how the application retrieves the information from the scanner.

=== Direct connection ===
The file size of a scan can go up to about 100 MB for a 600 dpi, 23 × 28 cm (slightly larger than A4 paper) uncompressed 24-bit image. Scanned files must be transferred and stored. Scanners can generate this volume of data in a matter of seconds, making a fast connection desirable.

Scanners communicate to their host computer using one of the following physical interfaces, listing roughly from slow to fast:
* Parallel port – Connecting through a parallel port is the slowest common transfer method. Early scanners had parallel port connections that could not transfer data faster than 70 kilobytes/second. The primary advantage of the parallel port connection was economic and user skill level: it avoided adding an interface card to the computer.
* GPIB – General Purpose Interface Bus. Certain drum scanners like the Howtek D4000 featured both a SCSI and GPIB interface. The latter conforms to the IEEE-488 standard, introduced in the mid-1970s. The GPIB interface has only been used by a few scanner manufacturers, mostly serving the DOS/Windows environment. For Apple Macintosh systems, National Instruments provided a NuBus GPIB interface card.
* Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) – SCSI is rarely used since the early 21st century, supported only by computers with a SCSI interface, either on a card or built-in. During the evolution of the SCSI standard, speeds increased. Widely available and easily set up USB and Firewire largely supplanted SCSI.
* Universal Serial Bus (USB) – USB scanners can transfer data quickly. The early USB 1.1 standard could transfer data at 1.5 megabytes per second (slower than SCSI), but the later USB 2.0/3.0 standards can transfer at more than 20/60 megabytes per second in practice.
* FireWire – Also known as IEEE-1394, FireWire is an interface of comparable speed to USB 2.0. Possible FireWire speeds are 25, 50, and 100, 400, and 800 megabits per second, but devices may not support all speeds.
* Proprietary interfaces – Bespoke interfaces were used on some early scanners that used a proprietary interface card rather than a standard interface.

=== Indirect connection ===
During the early 1990s professional flatbed scanners were available over a local computer network. This proved useful to publishers, print shops, etc. This functionality largely fell out of use as the cost of flatbed scanners reduced enough to make sharing unnecessary.

From 2000 all-in-one multi-purpose devices became available which were suitable for both small offices and consumers, with printing, scanning, copying, and fax capability in a single apparatus that can be made available to all members of a workgroup.

Battery-powered portable scanners store scans on internal memory; they can later be transferred to a computer either by direct connection, typically USB, or in some cases a memory card may be removed from the scanner and plugged into the computer.

=== Applications programming interface ===
A raster image editor must be able to communicate with a scanner. There are many different scanners, and many of those scanners use different protocols. In order to simplify applications programming, some application programming interfaces (APIs) were developed. The API presents a uniform interface to the scanner. This means that the application does not need to know the specific details of the scanner in order to access it directly. For example, Adobe Photoshop supports the TWAIN standard; therefore in theory Photoshop can acquire an image from any scanner that has a TWAIN driver.

In practice, there are often problems with an application communicating with a scanner. Either the application or the scanner manufacturer (or both) may have faults in their implementation of the API.

Typically, the API is implemented as a dynamically linked library. Each scanner manufacturer provides software that translates the API procedure calls into primitive commands that are issued to a hardware controller (such as the SCSI, USB, or FireWire controller). The manufacturer&#x27;s part of the API is commonly called a device driver, but that designation is not strictly accurate: the API does not run in kernel mode and does not directly access the device. Rather the scanner API library translates application requests into hardware requests.

Common scanner software API include:

* TWAIN – An API used by most scanners. Originally used for low-end and home-use equipment, it is now widely used for large-volume scanning.
* SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) – A free/open-source API for accessing scanners. Originally developed for Unix and Linux operating systems, it has been ported to OS/2, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. Unlike TWAIN, SANE does not handle the user interface. This allows batch scans and transparent network access without any special support from the device driver.
* Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) – An API provided by Microsoft for use on Microsoft Windows.
* Image and Scanner Interface Specification (ISIS) – Created by Pixel Translations, which still uses SCSI-2 for performance reasons, ISIS is used by large, departmental-scale, machines.

=== Bundled applications ===
Although no software beyond a scanning utility is a feature of any scanner, many scanners come bundled with software. Typically, in addition to the scanning utility, some type of raster image editor (such as Photoshop or GIMP) and optical character recognition (OCR) software are supplied. OCR software converts graphical images of text into standard text that can be edited using common word-processing and text-editing software; accuracy is rarely perfect.

== Output data ==
Some scanners, especially those designed for scanning printed documents, only work in black and white, but most modern scanners work in color. For the latter, the scanned result is a non-compressed RGB image, which can be transferred to a computer&#x27;s memory. The color output of different scanners is not the same due to the spectral response of their sensing elements, the nature of their light source, and the correction applied by the scanning software. While most image sensors have a linear response, the output values are usually gamma-compressed. Some scanners compress and clean up the image using embedded firmware. Once on the computer, the image can be processed with a raster graphics editor (such as Photoshop) and saved on a storage device (such as a hard disk).

Scans may be stored uncompressed in image file formats such as BMP; stored losslessly compressed in file formats such as TIFF and PNG; stored lossy-compressed in file formats such as JPEG; or stored as embedded images or converted to vector graphics within a PDF. Optical character recognition (OCR) software allows a scanned image of text to be converted into editable text with reasonable accuracy, so long as the text is cleanly printed and in a typeface and size that can be read by the software. OCR capability may be integrated into the scanning software, or the scanned image file can be processed with a separate OCR program.

== Specific uses ==
=== Document processing ===

Document processing requirements differ from those of image scanning. These requirements include scanning speed, automated paper feed, and the ability to automatically scan both the front and the back of a document. On the other hand, image scanning typically requires the ability to handle fragile and or three-dimensional objects as well as scan at a much higher resolution.

Document scanners have document feeders, usually larger than those sometimes found on copiers or all-purpose scanners. Scans are made at high speed, from 20 up to 420 pages per minute, often in grayscale, although many scanners support color. Many scanners can scan both sides of double-sided originals (duplex operation). Sophisticated document scanners have firmware or software that cleans up scans of text as they are produced, eliminating accidental marks and sharpening type; this would be unacceptable for photographic work, where marks cannot reliably be distinguished from desired fine detail. Files created are compressed as they are made.

The resolution used is usually from 150 to 300 dpi, although the hardware may be capable of 600 or higher resolution; this produces images of text good enough to read and for OCR, without the higher demands on storage space required by higher-resolution images.

Document scans are often processed using OCR technology to create editable and searchable files. Most scanners use ISIS or TWAIN device drivers to scan documents into TIFF format so that the scanned pages can be fed into a document management system that will handle the archiving and retrieval of the scanned pages. Lossy JPEG compression, which is very efficient for pictures, is undesirable for text documents, as slanted straight edges take on a jagged appearance, and solid black (or other color) text on a light background compresses well with lossless compression formats.

While paper feeding and scanning can be done automatically and quickly, preparation and indexing are necessary and require much work by humans. Preparation involves manually inspecting the papers to be scanned and making sure that they are in order, unfolded, without staples or anything else that might jam the scanner. Additionally, some industries such as legal and medical may require documents to have Bates Numbering or some other mark giving a document identification number and date/time of the document scan.

Indexing involves associating relevant keywords to files so that they can be retrieved by content. This process can sometimes be automated to some extent, but it often requires manual labour performed by data-entry clerks. One common practice is the use of barcode-recognition technology: during preparation, barcode sheets with folder names or index information are inserted into the document files, folders, and document groups. Using automatic batch scanning, the documents are saved into appropriate folders, and an index is created for integration into document management systems.

A specialized form of document scanning is book scanning. Technical difficulties arise from the books usually being bound and sometimes fragile and irreplaceable, but some manufacturers have developed specialized machinery to deal with this. Often special robotic mechanisms are used to automate the page-turning and scanning process.

=== Other uses ===
Flatbed scanners have been used as digital backs for large-format cameras to create high-resolution digital images of static subjects. A modified flatbed scanner has been used for documentation and quantification of thin layer chromatograms detected by fluorescence quenching on silica gel layers containing an ultraviolet (UV) indicator. The ChromImage is allegedly the first commercial flatbed scanner densitometer. It enables acquisition of TLC plate images and quantification of chromatograms by use of Galaxie-TLC software. Other than being turned into densitometers, flatbed scanners were also turned into colorimeters using different methods. Trichromatic Color Analyser is allegedly the first distributable system using a flatbed scanner as a tristimulus colorimetric device.

Flatbed scanners may also be used to create artwork directly, in a practice known as scanography.

In the biomedical research field, detection devices for DNA microarrays are also referred to as scanners. These scanners are high-resolution systems (up to 1 μm/pixel), similar to microscopes. Detection is performed using CCDs or photomultiplier tubes.

In pathology, scanners are used to capture glass slides with tissue from biopsies and other kinds of sampling, allowing for various methods of digital pathology such as telepathology and the application of artificial intelligence for interpretation.

<text>The 2003 mutual fund scandal was the result of the discovery of illegal late trading and market timing practices on the part of certain hedge fund and mutual fund companies.

==Spitzer investigation==
On September 3, 2003, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced the issuance of a complaint against New Jersey hedge fund company Canary Capital Partners LLC, charging that they had engaged in &quot;late trading&quot; in collusion with Bank of America&#x27;s Nations Funds. Bank of America is charged with permitting Canary to purchase mutual fund shares, after the markets had closed, at the closing price for that day. Spitzer&#x27;s investigation was initiated after his office received a ten-minute June 2003 phone call from a Wall Street worker alerting them to an instance of the &quot;late trading&quot; problem.

Canary Capital settled the complaint for US$40 million, while neither admitting nor denying guilt in the matter. Bank of America stated that it would compensate its mutual fund shareholders for losses incurred by way of the illegal transactions.

===&quot;Late trading&quot;===
In the United States, mutual fund prices are set once daily at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. &quot;Late trading&quot; occurs when traders are allowed to purchase fund shares after 4:00 p.m. at that day&#x27;s closing price. Under law, most mutual fund trades received after 4:00 p.m. must be executed at the following day&#x27;s closing price, but because some orders placed before 4:00 p.m. cannot be executed until after 4:00 p.m., brokers can collude with investors and submit post-4:00 p.m. trades as if they had been placed before 4:00 p.m. In 2003 several mutual fund companies and stock brokerage firms engaged in a trading practice which guaranteed profits for the stock brokerage firm’s insider managers and preferred customers.

To understand how this works, one needs to know how mutual funds shares are priced. Share values for mutual funds are not based upon bids from outside buyers. The price of a fund’s price was set in the evening based upon the value of the securities that it owned at the end of trading day, 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The law prohibited trading of mutual fund shares at any other price so the price set on Monday evening for a fund’s shares was available to anybody all day long on Tuesday until the market closed at 4:00 PM.

Pension funds and hedge funds are faced with unpredictable big inflows of cash on any given day. Their job is to put those funds to work as soon as possible.

Mutual funds were eager to take the money from these pension funds. The mutual fund’s management fees were based upon the amount of money (value of shares) held by the fund. More money held by the mutual fund meant more money at the end of the quarter for the fund’s managers. Pension managers had a legitimate problem with knowing just how much money they had to invest on any given day. There are changes from day to day as beneficiaries took withdrawals or employers made deposits.

An ostensibly harmless practice developed where mutual funds let it be known that they could be flexible about taking purchases at that morning’s price after the closing, even though that was prohibited by their rules. This was a matter of accommodating fund managers and encouraging them to trust that fund with their investment.

People were beginning to realize unanticipated uses for computer technology, in particular people realized they could track what was happening to the value of any mutual fund’s investments as quickly or even quicker than the mutual fund managers could using relatively simple spreadsheet programs. They realized that if permitted to buy after the close they could know what tomorrow’s price would be and provided they sold the shares tomorrow morning that they bought that evening would be guaranteed a profit, a profit that ordinary customers that played by the rules could not get. The trades involved small variances in price but because the buyers were purchasing millions of dollars in mutual fund shares the guaranteed profits for these insiders was significant and secure.

Such trades could be made with information about after-hours market developments in other countries, for example. Traders would buy in at the previous day&#x27;s close, and sell at the next day&#x27;s close for a likely profit. This practice hurt long-term buy-and-hold investors in the mutual fund, who experienced a continued drain in the fund&#x27;s net asset value (or NAV).

Late trading was not a new phenomenon. Prior to 1968, most mutual funds used &quot;backward pricing,&quot; in which the fund could be bought at the &quot;previous&quot; closing price. Thus, traders could purchase mutual funds on a day when the market was up, at the previous day&#x27;s lower closing price, and then sell at the purchase date&#x27;s closing price for a guaranteed profit. To prevent the exploitation of backward pricing, the SEC issued Rule 22c-1, requiring forward pricing of mutual fund transactions. This rule was enforced by randomly checking timestamps on orders, but intentional falsification of timestamps was difficult to catch. In addition, New York&#x27;s Martin Act can be interpreted to prohibit late trading as well, due to the unfair advantage the late trader gains over other traders.

===&quot;Market timing&quot;===
Spitzer and later the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also charged that major mutual fund groups such as Janus, Bank One&#x27;s One Group, and Strong Capital Management and others facilitated &quot;market timing&quot; trading for favored clients.

Market timing is an investment strategy in which an investor tries to profit from short-term market cycles by trading into and out of market sectors as they heat up and cool off. In a novel interpretation of New York&#x27;s Martin Act, Spitzer contended that fund firms committed fraud when they allowed some clients to trade more frequently than allowed in their fund documents and prospectus.

In many cases, funds bar or limit frequent trading because the practice may increase the cost of administering a mutual fund borne by all shareholders in the fund. Market timers also can make managing the fund more difficult since the fund may need to keep extra cash to meet liquidity demands of selling timers, although if timers are trading opposite flows of other investors, they can moderate cash fluctuations. Those funds that did not limit frequent trading in their prospectus—as well as a small number of funds that cater specifically to market timers—were not charged.

Spitzer contended that some advisors allowed market timers in order to increase their assets under management (fund advisors are paid based on the amount of assets in the fund).

==SEC investigation==
The SEC is charged with the regulation of the mutual fund industry in the United States. Following the announcement of Spitzer&#x27;s complaint, the SEC launched its own investigation of the matter which revealed the practice of &quot;front running&quot;. The SEC claimed that certain mutual fund companies alerted favored customers or partners when one or more of a company&#x27;s funds planned to buy or sell a large stock position. The partner was then in a position to trade shares of the stock in advance of the fund&#x27;s trading. Since mutual funds tend to hold large positions in specific stocks, any large selling or buying by the fund often impacts the value of the stock, from which the partner could stand to benefit. According to the SEC, the practice of front-running may constitute insider trading.

By early November, investigations led to the resignation of the chairmen of Strong Mutual Funds and Putnam Investments, both major mutual fund companies. In the case of Strong, the chairman Richard Strong was charged with market-timing trading involving his own company&#x27;s funds. In December, Invesco (market-timing) and Prudential Securities (widespread late trading) were added to the list of implicated fund companies.

==Settlements and trials==
Nearly all of the fund firms charged by Spitzer with allowing market timing or late trading had settled with his office and the SEC between mid-2004 and mid-2005.

One exception was J. W. Seligman, which chose in September 2005 to sue Spitzer in Federal court after their talks with Spitzer broke down. Seligman argued in its suit that Spitzer had overstepped his authority by attempting to oversee how Seligman&#x27;s funds set their advisory fee and that the regulatory oversight of fees is left by Congress to the SEC. Separately, in August 2005 Spitzer lost the only trial arising from his investigations when a jury could not reach a verdict on all counts in a case brought against Theodore Sihpol, III, a broker with Bank of America who introduced Canary Capital to the bank. Though Spitzer threatened to retry Sihpol, he did not do so. In September 2005 Spitzer&#x27;s office reached a plea bargain in a case brought against three executives charged with fraud for financing Canary and assisting its improper trading in mutual funds. That case against two Security Trust executives and one banker had appeared to be Spitzer&#x27;s strongest, and the settlement seemed to reflect Spitzer&#x27;s weakening hand in the wake of his defeat in the Sihpol case. The United States Second Circuit reversed the District Court In United States Security Commission v O`Malley on 19 May 2014 finding there was no consistent rule prohibiting Traders from engaging in market timing and therefore there was no requirement to disgorge profits made thereunder. This appeal related to a Rule 50 motion to dismiss on basis there was no credible evidence to leave to the jury as to breaching any duty of care and the Appeals Court Upheld same.

==Timeline==
*On April 28, 2003, every major US investment bank, including Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, Lehman Brothers Holdings, J.P. Morgan Chase, UBS Warburg, and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, were found to have aided and abetted efforts to defraud investors. The firms were fined a total of $1.4 billion by the SEC, triggering the creation of a Global Research Analyst Settlement Fund.
*In May, 2003, the SEC disclosed that several “brokerage firms paid rivals that agreed to publish positive reports on companies whose shares..they issued to the public. This practice made it appear that a throng of believers were recommending these companies&#x27; shares.” This was false. “From 1999 through 2001, for example, one firm paid about $2.7 million to approximately 25 other investment banks for these so-called research guarantees, regulators said. Nevertheless, the same firm boasted in its annual report to shareholders that it had come through investigations of analyst conflicts of interest with its ‘reputation for integrity’ maintained.”
*On September 3, 2003, the New York State Attorney General announced he had “obtained evidence of widespread illegal trading schemes, ‘late trading’ and ‘market timing,’ that potentially cost mutual fund shareholders billions of dollars annually. This, according to the Attorney General, was &quot;like allowing betting on a horse race after the horses have crossed the finish line.”
*On September 4, 2003, a major investment bank, Goldman Sachs, admitted that it had violated anti-fraud laws. Specifically, the firm misused material, nonpublic information that the US Treasury would suspend issuance of the 30-year bond. The firm agreed to “pay over $9.3 million in penalties.” On April 28, 2003, the same firm was found to have “issued research reports that were not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith .. contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims.. and/or contained opinions for which there were no reasonable bases.” The firm was fined $110 million (for a total of $119.3 million in fines in six months).
*On September 17, 2003, New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso resigns in the aftermath of the scandal of a $140 million package.
*On October 28, 2003, the SEC filed enforcement actions against Putnam Investments and two portfolio managers alleging that they portfolio managers were market timing in funds that they managed.
*On November 20, 2003, the SEC announced “charges concerning undisclosed market timing against Harold J. Baxter and Gary L. Pilgrim in the Commissions’ pending action in federal district court in Philadelphia.” In a later settlement, Baxter and Pilgrim agreed to “pay $80 million – $60 million in disgorgement and $20 million in civil penalties.”
*On December 3, 2003, the SEC proposed new rules to stop after-hours trading in mutual funds.
*On December 18, 2003, the SEC “announced an enforcement action against Alliance Capital Management L.P. (Alliance Capital) for defrauding mutual fund investors. The SEC ordered Alliance Capital to pay $250 million. The SEC also ordered Alliance Capital to undertake certain compliance and fund governance reforms designed to prevent a recurrence of the kind of conduct described in the Commission&#x27;s Order. Finally, the SEC found that “Alliance Capital breached its fiduciary duty to (its) funds and misled those who invested in them.”
*On October 8, 2004, the SEC “announced..enforcement actions against Invesco Funds Group, Inc. (IFG), AIM Advisors, Inc. (AIM Advisors), and AIM Distributors, Inc. (ADI). The Commission issued an order finding that IFG, AIM Advisors, and ADI violated the federal securities laws by facilitating widespread market timing trading in mutual funds with which each entity was affiliated. The settlements require IFG to pay $215 million in disgorgement and $110 million in civil penalties, and require AIM Advisors and ADI to pay, jointly and severally, $20 million in disgorgement and an aggregate $30 million in civil penalties.”
*On November 4, 2004, the SEC “filed a settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia) for violations of proxy disclosure and other reporting requirements in connection with the 2001 merger between First Union Corporation (First Union) and Old Wachovia Corporation (Old Wachovia). Under the settlement, Wachovia must pay a $37 million penalty and is to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.”
*On November 30, 2004, the SEC announced “the filing..of charges against American International Group, Inc. (AIG) arising out of AIG’s offer and sale of an earnings management product.” The company “agreed to pay a total of $126 million, consisting of a penalty of $80 million, and disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $46 million.”
*On December 22, 2004, “the SEC, NASD and the New York Stock Exchange announced..enforcement proceedings against Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., L.P., a registered broker-dealer headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.” According to the announcement, “Edward Jones failed to adequately disclose revenue sharing payments that it received from a select group of mutual fund families that Edward Jones recommended to its customers.” The company agreed to “pay $75 million in disgorgement and civil penalties. All of that money will be placed in a Fair Fund for distribution to Edward Jones customers.”
*On January 25, 2005, “the SEC announced the filing in federal district court of separate settled civil injunctive actions against Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. (Goldman Sachs) relating to the firms&#x27; allocations of stock to institutional customers in initial public offerings (IPOs) underwritten by the firms during 1999 and 2000.”
*According to the Associated Press, on January 31, 2005, “the nation’s largest insurance brokerage company, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc., based in New York, will pay $850 million to policyholders hurt by” corporate practices that included “bid rigging, price fixing and the use of hidden incentive fees.” The company will issue a public apology calling its conduct &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;shameful,&quot; according to New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. In addition, “the company will publicly promise to adopt reforms.”
*On Feb. 9, 2005, the SEC “announced the settlement of an enforcement action against Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (Columbia Advisors), Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (Columbia Distributor), and three former Columbia executives in connection with undisclosed market timing arrangements in the Columbia funds. In settling the matter, the Columbia entities will pay $140 million, all of which will be distributed to investors harmed by the conduct. The SEC also brought fraud charges against two additional former Columbia senior executives in federal court in Boston.”
*On March 23, 2005, the SEC “announced that Putnam Investment Management, LLC (Putnam) will pay $40 million. The Commission issued an order that finds Putnam failed to adequately disclose to the Putnam Funds&#x27; Board of Trustees and the Putnam Funds&#x27; shareholders the conflicts of interest that arose from..arrangements for increased visibility within the broker-dealers&#x27; distribution systems.”

*On April 12, 2005, the SEC “instituted and simultaneously settled an enforcement action against the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., finding that the NYSE, over the course of nearly four years, failed to police specialists, who engaged in widespread and unlawful proprietary trading on the floor of the NYSE.” As part of the settlement, the “NYSE agreed to an undertaking of $20 million to fund regulatory audits of the NYSE&#x27;s regulatory program every two years through the year 2011.” On that same date, the Commission “instituted administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against 20 former New York Stock Exchange specialists for fraudulent and other improper trading practices.”
*On April 19, 2005, the SEC announced “that KPMG LLP has agreed to settle the SEC&#x27;s charges against it in connection with the audits of Xerox Corp. from 1997 through 2000. As part of the settlement, KPMG consented to the entry of a final judgment in the SEC&#x27;s civil litigation against it pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The final judgment..orders KPMG to pay disgorgement of $9.8 million (representing its audit fees for the 1997-2000 Xerox audits), prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $2.675 million, and a $10 million civil penalty, for a total payment of $22.475 million.”
*On April 28, 2005, the SEC announced “that it has instituted settled enforcement proceedings against Tyson Foods, Inc. and its former Chairman and CEO Donald &quot;Don&quot; Tyson.

The settlement is part of a global resolution of federal and state actions under which AIG will pay in excess of $1.6 billion to resolve claims related to improper accounting, bid rigging and practices involving workers’ compensation funds.”
*On March 9, 2006, the SEC filed a lawsuit “against registered investment adviser BMA Ventures, Inc. and its president, William Robert Kepler, 35, of Dallas, Texas, alleging that they illegally obtained approximately $1.9 million in a fraudulent ‘scalping’ scheme from January 2004 through March 2005. Scalping is the illegal practice of recommending that others purchase a security and secretly selling the same security contrary to the recommendation.”
*On March 16, 2006, the SEC “announced a settled enforcement action against Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. (BS&amp;Co.) and Bear, Stearns Securities Corp. (BSSC) (collectively, Bear Stearns), charging Bear Stearns with securities fraud for facilitating unlawful late trading and deceptive market timing of mutual funds by its customers and customers of its introducing brokers. The Commission issued an Order finding that from 1999 through September 2003, Bear Stearns provided technology, advice and deceptive devices that enabled its market timing customers and introducing brokers to late trade and to evade detection by mutual funds.

*On April 11, 2006, the SEC announced “charges against individuals involved in widespread and brazen international schemes of serial insider trading that yielded at least $6.7 million of illicit gains. The schemes were orchestrated by..a research analyst in the Fixed Income division of Goldman Sachs, and a former employee of Goldman Sachs.”
*On July 15, 2007, Delta Data launched a compliance solution for algometric trade analysis to identify market timing in mutual funds. This was the first step towards transparency into sub-accounted mutual fund positions.

<doc id="317630" wikidata="Q6289036" url="?curid=317630" title="Josh Kalis">
<text>Josh Kalis (born April 27, 1976) is a professional skateboarder who specializes in &quot;street skateboarding&quot;. Kalis was sponsored by Alien Workshop for a significant period of time before switching to board sponsor, DGK, in 2009.

==Biography==
Kalis was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US, and split his childhood between Philadelphia with his mother and Dallas with his father.

==Professional skateboarding==
Alongside Stevie Williams (founder of DGK), Kalis is well known for his involvement in the &quot;LOVE Park&quot; scene in Philadelphia, US, during the late 1990s. LOVE Park (its official name is JFK Plaza) is an inner-city public park situated at the intersection of 16th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in Center City Philadelphia. Kalis can be seen skating the park in the following videos: &quot;Photosynthesis&quot;, &quot;The DC Video&quot;, and &quot;Time Code&quot;.

Prior to joining the Alien Workshop team, Kalis was planning to collaborate with fellow professional skateboarder Mark Appleyard on their own board company. Following his eventual recruitment to the team, Kalis and Rob Dyrdek then facilitated the recruitment of Anthony Van Engelen (AVE).

Alongside Dyrdek, Kalis has been a longtime rider with the DC Shoes skate shoe company and, as of March 2013, his latest signature shoe, entitled the &quot;Centric S&quot;, was released in mid-2012—the Centric S was incorporated into the DC &quot;Rediscover&quot; campaign and Kalis&#x27; model received the tagline, &quot;Rediscover Heritage&quot;.

Silver Trucks was a brand that was launched in 2003 under the guidance of Dyrdek, an original team rider. Kalis has released signature products with the company, including a skate tool, and other team riders include Brandon Biebel, Chaz Ortiz, and Nyjah Huston.

Kalis left Alien Workshop to join Williams on DGK; Kalis explained the decision-making process in 2009:
Me and Stevie were just talking one day and were saying, &quot;Man, we gotta team back up on somethin&#x27;,&quot; you know? We were talking about how just stale skateboarding was and how people just don&#x27;t really hang out with each other anymore. They just kind of skate for companies, whether it be because it&#x27;s just a cool company or it&#x27;s a solid paycheck. Whatever, you know? We were just talking about how skateboarding just lost its vibe of friendship and lifestyle, you know?

Kalis has released a signature collection through sunglasses company 9five Eyewear, entitled the &quot;KLS Signature Collection&quot;—an accompanying video was also released to launch the products.

===Sponsors===
As of July 2012, Kalis is sponsored by DGK, DC Shoe Co., DC Apparel, 9five Eyewear, Reflex, MOB, and Silver.

==Video games==
In January 2010, Electronic Arts (EA) announced that Kalis would be in the EA video game, &quot;Skate 3&quot;. The company then published an introductory video for Kalis with the following blurb: &quot;Kalis is one of the best. Simple as that. With his raw street skating, and one of a kind style, Josh Kalis is always a pleasure to watch. Make sure to take a look around Port Carverton and you might be lucky enough to see him yourself. Welcome to the city Kalis!&quot;

==Hella Clips==
Kalis launched the skateboard video upload portal &quot;Hellaclips&quot; in partnership with fellow professional skateboarder Colin McKay in late-2011.

==Influence==
In July 2013, professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez identified Kalis as one of his &quot;top ten&quot; favorite professional skateboarders and explained the inclusion on his personal website:
The style, the swag, his tre flips. If you ask me he has the best flat ground tre flips. He’s still killing it and ripping as well. He had that East Coast Philly vibe when I first came in the game, I know he spent a lot of time in S.F. as well but that Love Park era, man! He made that place look so fun to me. He introduced the world to Stevie Williams. 

==Personal life==
Unlike most professionals, Kalis has not remained in California for the entire duration of his career and has resided in various cities, both within and outside of the US. Kalis has lived in Grand Rapids in Michigan (where he grew up), Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Barcelona, and San Francisco. Dyrdek has stated:
He&#x27;s truly lived in all of like the true skate meccas for pure street skating. You know what I mean? Like no one else has done that. When SF was cracking, he moved to SF. When Philly was resurging, he moved to Philly and blew Philly up. When LOVE Park went down, he made the movement to spending six months a year in Barcelona. And then he desperately tried to turn Chicago into Philly. That didn&#x27;t work out so hard. And he is pure of, wake up in your house and go skate raw street. And it&#x27;s one of the purest, pure street skateboarding careers.

Josh Kalis has lived in many places throughout his career. His name is synonymous with skateboarding in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago. In 2012, Kalis resided in Carlsbad, California, US, with his wife and two daughters but as of 2018 he left southern California to return to Grand Rapids and has been currently residing in Michigan.

<text>The Texas Highland Lakes are a chain of fresh water reservoirs in Central Texas formed by dams on the lower Colorado River. The Texas Colorado River winds southeast from West Texas to Matagorda Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.

The lower Colorado River basin has a history of major flooding. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) built the dams to manage floods and generate hydroelectric power in the 1930s and 1940s.

Lady Bird Lake (formerly Town Lake) and the respective Longhorn Dam are sometimes considered the seventh &quot;honorary&quot; lake and dam of the Highland Lakes despite being commissioned and managed by the City of Austin instead of the LCRA. Unlike the other reservoirs in the chain which were constructed primarily to prevent flooding and generate hydroelectric power, Lady Bird Lake was constructed in order to provide a cooling pond for the city&#x27;s new power plant.

The two largest lakes—Buchanan and Travis—are the reservoirs that store water supply for the region. The smaller lakes—Inks, LBJ, Marble Falls and Austin—are pass-through lakes that are operated within a certain range.

In all, the six official dams of the Highland Lakes have a hydroelectric power production capacity of 295MW, with Mansfield Dam alone able to provide 108MW. While Longhorn Dam has no hydroelectric production capacity, Lady Bird Lake served as a cooling pond for the 100MW Seaholm Power Plant and the 550MW Holly Street Power Plant until they were closed in 1996 and 2007, respectively.
