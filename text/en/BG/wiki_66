<text>WebObjects is a discontinued Java web application server and a server-based web application framework originally developed by NeXT Software, Inc.

WebObject&#x27;s hallmark features are its object-orientation, database connectivity, and prototyping tools. Applications created with WebObjects can be deployed as web sites, Java WebStart desktop applications, and/or standards-based web services.

The deployment runtime is pure Java, allowing developers to deploy WebObjects applications on platforms that support Java. One can use the included WebObjects Java SE application server or deploy on third-party Java EE application servers such as JBoss, Apache Tomcat, WebLogic Server or IBM WebSphere.

WebObjects was maintained by Apple for quite a while. However, because Apple has stopped maintaining the software, it now is instead maintained by an online community of volunteers. This community calls it &quot;Project Wonder&quot;.

==History==

===NeXT creates WebObjects===

WebObjects was created by NeXT Software, Inc., first publicly demonstrated at the Object World conference in 1995 and released to the public in March 1996. The time and cost benefits of rapid, object-oriented development attracted major corporations to WebObjects in the early days of e-commerce, with clients including BBC News, Dell Computer, Disney, DreamWorks SKG, Fannie Mae, GE Capital, Merrill Lynch, and Motorola.

===Apple acquires NeXT, and continues to maintain the software===

Following NeXT&#x27;s merger into Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects&#x27; public profile languished. Many early adopters later switched to alternative technologies, including Apple which had been the last remaining large client for the software, relying on it to power parts of its online Apple Store and the iTunes Storewhich was WebObjects&#x27; highest-profile implementation at the time.

WebObjects was part of Apple&#x27;s strategy of using software to drive hardware sales, and in 2000 the price was lowered from $50,000 (for the full deployment license) to $699. From May 2001, WebObjects was included with Mac OS X Server, and no longer required a license key for development or deployment.

WebObjects transitioned from a stand-alone product to be a part of Mac OS X with the release of version 5.3 in June 2005. The developer tools and frameworks, which previously sold for US$699, were bundled with Apple&#x27;s Xcode IDE. Support for other platforms, such as Windows, was then discontinued. Apple said that it would further integrate WebObjects development tools with Xcode in future releases. This included a new EOModeler Plugin for Xcode. This strategy, however, was not pursued further.

In 2006, Apple announced the deprecation of Mac OS X&#x27;s Cocoa-Java bridge with the release of Xcode 2.4 at the August 2006 Worldwide Developers Conference, and with it all dependent features, including the entire suite of WebObjects developer applications: EOModeler, EOModeler Plugin, WebObjects Builder, WebServices Assistant, RuleEditor and WOALauncher. Apple had decided to concentrate its engineering resources on the runtime engine of WebObjects, leaving the future responsibility for developer applications with the open-source community. The main open-source alternativethe Eclipse IDE with the WOLips suite of pluginshad matured to such an extent that its capabilities had, in many areas, surpassed those of Apple&#x27;s own tools, which had not seen significant updates for a number of years.

Apple promised to provide assistance to the community in its efforts to extend such tools and develop new ones. In a posting to the webobjects-dev mailing list, Daryl Lee from Apple&#x27;s WebObjects team publicly disclosed the company&#x27;s new strategy for WebObjects. It promised to &quot;make WebObjects the best server-side runtime environment&quot; by:

* Improving performance, manageability, and standards compliance

* Making WebObjects work well with Ant and the most popular IDEs, including Xcode and Eclipse

* Opening and making public all standards and formats that WebObjects depends upon

WebObjects 5.4, which shipped with Mac OS X Leopard in October 2007, removed the license key requirement for both development and deployment of WebObjects applications on all platforms. All methods for checking license limitations were then deprecated.

===The end of WebObjects, and the beginning of Project Wonder===

In 2009, Apple stopped issuing new releases of WebObjects outside Apple. The community decided to continue development with Project Wonder, an open-source framework which is built on top of the core WebObjects frameworks and which extends them. For example, Project Wonder has updated development tools and provides a REST framework that was not part of the original WebObjects package.

Though once included in the default installation of Mac OS X Server, WebObjects was no longer installed by default starting with Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server and shortly after, Apple ceased promoting or selling WebObjects. As of 2016, WebObjects is actively supported by its developer community, the &quot;WOCommunity Association&quot;, by extending the core frameworks and providing fixes with Project Wonder. The organization last held a Worldwide WebObjects Developer Conference, WOWODC, in 2013.

In May 2016, Apple confirmed that WebObjects had been discontinued.

==Tools==
As of 2016 most WebObjects architects and engineers are using the tools being developed by the WebObjects community. These tools run within the Eclipse IDE and are open-source. The WebObjects plug-ins for Eclipse are known as WOLips.

Building WebObjects frameworks and applications for deployment is typically achieved using the WOProject set of tools for Apache Ant or Apache Maven. These tools are distributed with WOLips.

==Core frameworks==
A WebObjects application is essentially a server-side executable, created by combining prebuilt application framework objects with the developer&#x27;s own custom code. WebObjects&#x27; frameworks can be broken down into three core parts:

* The WebObjects Framework (WOF) is at the highest level of the system. It is responsible for the application&#x27;s user interface and state management. It uses a template-based approach to take that object graph and turn it into HTML, or other tag-based information display standards, such as XML or SMIL. It provides an environment where you can use and create reusable components. Components are chunks of presentation (HTML) and functionality (Java code) often with a parameter list to enhance reusability. WebObjects Builder is used to create the HTML-templates and creates the linking, for instance, a Java String object to interface objects like an input field in a web form.

* The Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF) is, perhaps, the hallmark feature of WebObjects. EOF communicates with relational databases and turns database rows into an object graph. Using EOModeler the developer can create an abstraction of the database in the forms of Java objects. In order to access or insert information into the database the developer simply accesses the Java Enterprise Objects (EOs) from their business logic. After that EOF manages the Enterprise Objects and automatically creates the required SQL-code to commit the changes to the database.

* Java Foundation. Both Enterprise Objects and WebObjects rest on the aptly named Java Foundation classes. This framework contains the fundamental data structure implementations and utilities used throughout the rest of WebObjects. Examples include basic value and collection classes, such as arrays, dictionaries (objects that contain key-value pairs) and formatting classes. Java Foundation is similar to the Foundation framework contained in Apple&#x27;s Cocoa API for macOS desktop applications, however Java Foundation is written in Pure Java as opposed to Cocoa&#x27;s Objective-C (with its Java bridge runtime wrapper). Foundation classes are prefixed with the letters &quot;NS&quot; (a reference to their NeXTSTEP OS heritage). Since the transition of WebObjects to Java in 2000, the functionality of many of Apple&#x27;s Java Foundation classes is replicated in Sun&#x27;s own JDK. However, they persist largely for reasons of backwards-compatibility and developers are free to use whichever frameworks they prefer.

==Rules-Based Rapid Application Development (RBRAD)==
WebObjects features a set of rapid development technologies that can automatically create a Web application without the need to write any Java code. Given a model file for a database, WebObjects will create an interface supporting nine common database tasks, including querying, editing and listing. Such applications are useful for prototyping or administering a database, perhaps to check relationships or to seed the database with data.

The user interface is generated dynamically, on-the-fly at runtime using a rules-based systemno code is generated. Consequently, one can modify an application&#x27;s configuration at runtime (using an assistant program) without recompiling or relaunching the application.

Developers can utilize one of three different technologies, depending upon the type of interface they wish to employ:

* Direct To Web (D2W) allows developers to rapidly create an HTML-based Web application that accesses a database.

* Direct To Java Client allows developers to rapidly create a client desktop application using the Java Swing toolkit. An advantage of Java Client applications is that they can take advantage of the processing power of the client computer to perform operations such as sorting a list of items received from the server.

* Direct To Web Services allows developers to rapidly develop Web service-based applications that provide access to a data store.

===Advantages of RBRAD===

* Vastly decreased development and debugging time;

* Increased stability through the use of highly exercised code;

* By using the information contained in the data model file, applications will not violate database integrity. Normally you would have to write code to avoid such situations and handle errors generated by bad data;

* Fully utilizes the validation services provided by WebObjects and Enterprise Objects.

==Java compatibility==
WebObjects is a 100% Java product with the following Java-based features:
*Deployment: Applications can be deployed on any operating system that has Java 1.3 or later. Many developers have successfully deployed on Windows and various Linux systems such as Red Hat Linux, Debian and SUSE. Applications can also be hosted on any Java EE compatible application server such as JBoss.
*Java EE integration: WebObjects applications can be packaged in a single directory (an exploded .war file) that make it easier to deploy to a Java EE servlet container.
*JDBC: Since WebObjects uses JDBC for database connectivity any DBMS that has a JDBC-driver can be used within WebObjects.
*Swing interface: WebObjects applications can be delivered to the user as a &quot;Java Client application&quot; or as a Java applet.

==WOWODC==
Since 2007, the community has held an annual conference for WebObjects developers, WOWODC. In 2007 and 2008, the conference was held the weekend before WWDC, and in 2009, the community promoted two conferences: WOWODC West in San Francisco on June 6 and 7, immediately before WWDC, and WOWODC East in Montreal on August 29 and 30. WOWODC 2010 was held in Montreal on August 27, 28 and 29, 2010. WOWODC 2011 was held in Montreal on July 1, 2 and 3 in 2011. WOWODC 2012 was held in Montreal on June 30, July 1 and 2, 2012. WOWODC 2013 was held in Montreal. WOWODC 2014 was held in Montreal (April 12, 13 and 14). WOWODC 2015 was held in Hamburg on April 25, 26 and 27. WOWODC 2016 was held in Montréal on June 24, 25 and 26

==Open-source alternatives==
Interest in OpenSource alternatives to WebObjects that use the Objective-C language grew with WebObjects&#x27; move from Objective-C (last version WO 4.5.1) to Java (first version WO 5.0). The two frameworks available are SOPE, which has been used as the basis of the OpenGroupware.org groupware server for about eight years, and GNUstepWeb, which is part of the GNUstep project. Open-source rewrites of the EOF frameworks also exist (AJRDatabase, GDL2).

There are also Java-based alternatives:

* Wotonomy is a project, hosted on SourceForge, that implements a clean-room, open-source version of the WebObjects 5.x system. It provides a near-complete implementation of the MVC web-framework, as well as partial implementations of Foundation, Control, and Data layers, and other features. It is sufficiently functional for low-transaction volume, single-source database applications. While the project&#x27;s structure was re-organized in 2006 around an Apache Maven build infrastructure and migrated to the Subversion revision control system, there has not been any substantial update to the codebase since 2003.

*Apache Tapestry has a design and philosophy similar to that of WebObjects. Tapestry is frequently combined with Apache Cayenne, a persistence framework inspired by EOF.

* GETobjects is another framework with an API similar to WebObjects 5.x that is related to SOPE.

An attempt to do a Swift version based on SOPE / GETobjects is available as SwiftObjects. The implementation for Swift 4 is limited due to the reflection capabilities of that Swift version.

<text>This is a list of the heads of state of the Republic of China (ROC) since 1912 and the state representatives of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) since 1949.

== List of presidents of the Republic (since 1912) ==
This is a list of the presidents of the Republic of China (ROC) (1912–present). The Republic of China president is called 總統 (Zǒngtǒng, &quot;President&quot;), and from 1912–1928, 大總統 (Dàzǒngtǒng, &quot;Grand President&quot;).

Since 1949, the &quot;de facto&quot; territory of the ROC is reduced to Taiwan and its surrounding islands, the former previously ruled by Japan from 1895 to 1945, no longer governing mainland China. It continued to represent China in the United Nations until it was expelled on 25 October 1971 and diplomatically by the United States government until 1 January 1979. The President of the ROC is also known as the President of Taiwan due to the territory it governs.

All the names on this list follow the Oriental convention with the family name first and given name second.

Provisional Government: 

Beiyang Government: 
Nationalist to Constitutional Government: 

==List of presidents of the People&#x27;s Republic (since 1949)==
This is a list of all the chairmen of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1954–1975) and the presidents of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1982–present). The President of the PRC is called 主席 (zhǔxí), formerly translated as Chairman.

<doc id="317404" wikidata="Q1436973" url="?curid=317404" title="Ford Ranchero">
<text>The Ford Ranchero is a coupe utility that was produced by Ford between 1957 and 1979. Unlike a standard pickup truck, the Ranchero was adapted from a two-door station wagon platform that integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body. A total of 508,355 units were produced during the model&#x27;s production run. Over its lifespan it was variously derived from full-sized, compact, and intermediate automobiles sold by Ford for the North American market.

During the 1970s, the Ranchero name was used in the South African market for a rebadged Australian Ford Falcon utility. Shipped from Australia in complete knock down (CKD) form, these vehicles were assembled in South Africa at Ford&#x27;s plant in Port Elizabeth. In Argentina, a utility version of the locally produced Ford Falcon was also called Ranchero.

The original Ranchero sold well enough to spawn a competitor from General Motors in 1959, the Chevrolet El Camino.

==History==
The first Ford Model T and Model A pickup trucks were created from roadsters by placing a pickup box behind the body of a car. In 1934, Ford Australia&#x27;s designer Lew Bandt modified a coupe with a smoothly integrated loadbed that could be used like a car to drive to church or to deliver pigs to market. This created the coupe utility which remains a popular body style known as the &quot;ute&quot; in Australia. In North America, pickup trucks evolved into a heavier duty form with cabs and beds that were quite distinct from passenger automobiles. The Ranchero was the first postwar American vehicle of its type adapted from a popular sedan from the factory. It combined the sleek looks of a sedan with the utility of a light-duty pickup truck.

==First generation (1957–1959)==

Introduced in December 1956, three months after the traditional September model year start-up, the Ranchero was based on the standard and new-for-1957 full-sized Ford platform, specifically the short-wheelbase Custom sedan, two-door Ranch Wagon station wagon, and utilitarian Courier sedan delivery. Essentially a Courier with an open, reinforced bed, its own unique rear window and integrated cab and cargo box, the Ranchero was initially offered in two trim levels, and throughout the model run, was built on the corresponding automobile assembly line, but sold as a truck through Ford&#x27;s truck division. An extremely basic standard model was marketed to traditional pickup truck buyers such as farmers, and the Custom picked up most of the options and accessories available on the Fairlane line, including stainless steel bodyside mouldings and two-tone paint. 

Upscale models were badged both as a Fairlane and Ranchero, with a stylized representation of a Longhorn as the symbol for the model located on the tailgate. Indeed, print advertising of the time played on the theme of the American Southwest that the Spanish model name and Longhorn symbol were meant to evoke, showing artistic representations of the vehicle being used in ranching and outdoor activities, proclaiming it as &quot;More Than A Car! More Than A Truck!&quot; The Ranchero was a hit with both the automotive press and the buying public, filling an untapped market niche for vehicles with the utility of a light pickup and the ease of operation and riding characteristics of a car. In fact, the Ranchero had a marginally higher cargo capacity by about 50 lb (23 kg) than the half-ton F-Series pickup. Both standard and Custom could be ordered with any engine available for Ford cars, all the way up to the &quot;Thunderbird Special&quot;. In Canada, the Ranchero was also available in the Meteor line-up. Seat belts and padded instrument panels were optional.

The 1958 version remained largely unchanged under the skin save for the new front sheet metal (shared by the big &#x27;58 Ford and inspired by the Thunderbird) and its new four-headlamp arrangement. The 1957 rear end and tail lights were reused on the 1958 Ranchero.

The 1959 model was built with the same wheelbase as all 1959 Fords, giving the Ranchero the advantage over its predecessors of a new, longer bed. However, this would be the last time the vehicle would grow either in size or trim for several years to come. The windshield was also 25% larger. Seatcovers were vinyl or &quot;woven plastic&quot;, while the spare tire was located behind the passenger seat. The Custom Ranchero was the only model marketed in 1959, and was offered in 26 colors (11 solid shades, 11 two-tone combinations with white on top, and four other two-tone choices).

==Second generation (1960–1965) Falcon Ranchero==

In 1960, the Ranchero became much smaller, based on Ford&#x27;s compact Falcon, specifically the two-door sedan delivery variant. The popularity of small, economical cars like the Volkswagen Beetle perpetuated a shift in thinking among the three largest American manufacturers; 1959 had the introduction of the 1960 Falcon along with the 1960 Chevrolet Corvair and Plymouth Valiant. A pickup version of the Volkswagen Bus and a van based on the Chevrolet Corvair were offered, as well. The economic recession of the late 1950s also certainly played a role. Ford believed the market wanted a more practical vehicle, one much smaller, lighter, and cheaper than a full-sized pickup truck, and indeed the Ranchero sold well in this incarnation. Now marketed in print as the &quot;Falcon Ranchero&quot;, the new vehicle&#x27;s standard powerplant was an economical straight-6. In 1961, the straight-6 was offered, and in 1963, the optional V8 was offered in addition to the 144 and 170. The two-speed Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission (offered between 1960 and 1963) or three-speed C4 Cruise-O-Matic could be ordered as could a three-speed manual transmission. The Ranchero had an 800-lb load capacity.

Three almost entirely different coupé utility bodies were available for this generation of Falcon: the Australian Falcon Utility differed in having a shorter rear overhang than North American models, a cargo box that extended farther forward than the rear window, and shorter doors, while the Argentinian version also shared the sedan&#x27;s overall length and short &quot;four-door&quot; doors, adding higher and more squared-off cargo box sides.

The Ranchero evolved along with the Falcon in 1964, becoming just a little larger along with its parent and using the same basic body style for 1964 and 1965. In 1965, the V8 replaced the discontinued 260 and an alternator replaced the generator in all Ford cars.

==Third generation (1966–1967)==
The 1966 version was a one-year model, when Falcon and Fairlane were redeveloped on the same basic platform, one which did not include the sedan delivery, as 1965 marked the final year of sedan delivery production. Instead, the 1966 Ranchero used Falcon front sheet metal, trim, and interior accents on a modified station wagon platform although Rancheros made late in the &#x27;66 model year had the same front clip as the Fairlane. Engines available were the I6, I6, and two- and four-barrel versions of the V8. Transmissions choices ranged from the C4 three-speed automatic to the three-speed column-shifted manual. The 1966 model was marketed simply as the Ford Ranchero, and did not carry Falcon badges. Seat belts were standard.

The 1967 Ranchero, based on the post-&#x27;66 Falcon/Fairlane chassis, used the basic 1966 Ranchero body with Fairlane trim, front sheet metal, and interior treatments instead of Falcon. It was marketed as the Fairlane Ranchero.

This was a well-received and unique one-year vehicle, with clean, straight lines, dual stacked headlamps, and plenty of power; the Ranchero had entered the muscle car arena in 1967. Engine options started with a straight-6 and went up to a FE-series V8 giving and backed by an optional C6 automatic, the new-for-1966 heavy duty variant of the C4 in addition to the tried and true Toploader 4-speed manual gearbox. The &#x27;67 also had the largest expansion of trim levels since the vehicle&#x27;s introduction 10 years prior. Supplementing the base model were the new Ranchero 500 and 500/XL. In spite of being added to the Fairlane family for 1967, Ford&#x27;s top performance options for the Fairlane - the GT and the GTA - did not apply to the Ranchero and is a common misconception that they were available.

What did apply to all American cars in 1967 was the use of a dual-circuit braking system with a dual-chambered master cylinder. Increased awareness of passenger safety resulted in such innovations as safety-padded windshield pillars and an unusual 1967-only safety pad which protruded from the center of the three-spoked steering wheel to a point just beyond the rim of the steering wheel. It was designed to minimize abdominal injuries in the event of a collision.

==Fourth generation (1968–1969)==

In 1968, the Fairlane line was supplemented by the new Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane&#x27;s distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured warning lights for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn signal indicator in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod directly in front of the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and oil pressure, as well as the right turn signal indicator, were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative &quot;clock delete&quot; panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt warning light was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front side marker lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.

Three trim levels were offered, beginning with the sparsely trimmed base Ranchero, the Ranchero 500 trimmed like the corresponding Fairlane 500, and the top-of-the line Ranchero GT with its Torino GT trim. Engine choices began with the 250 cubic inch I6 and ran to several V8 choices, including the standard 289 with two-barrel carburetor, and the FE-based 390. The powerful Cobra Jet, another FE derivative and the largest engine offered in the Ranchero to date, was a mid-1968 option. The 1968 model marked the final year of production of the 289; a V8 with two-barrel carburetor became the standard V8 in 1969. Two new upmarket engine choices were available, the 351 Windsor with two- and four-barrel carburetion. The FMX automatic was available with both, which was a variant of the old Cruise-o-Matic and was offered exclusively with either 351.

Like the Torino/Fairlane, the Ranchero could be had with virtually all of the same options as its cousins, including air conditioning, bucket seats, center console, AM/FM radio, optional wheels, front power disc brakes, hood scoop (standard on GT), and even a vinyl top. Changes across the 1969 model line were slight and included a flatter three-piece grille less the horizontal crossbar and Ford crest, relocation of GT grille badging from the crest to the lower right corner of the grille as viewed from the front, a change from black-faced instruments with white numerals to brushed aluminum with black numerals and a slimmer, two-spoke steering wheel pad similar to those across the Ford product line, unlike the wheel with its broader &quot;safety pad&quot; and separate horn ring used in the 1968 intermediates and compacts. While the pad may have changed, the horn ring did not. The only change unique to the Ranchero was the relocation of the &quot;Ranchero&quot; script from the rear quarter panels to the front fenders.

A little-known and extremely rare offering in 1969 was the Rio Grande. Available on special order, this was essentially a GT in the so-called &quot;Grabber&quot; colors of &quot;Wimbledon White&quot;, &quot;Poppy Red&quot; or &quot;Calypso Coral&quot;, partially blacked-out hood with scoop, side stripes, bed rails, vinyl top, and unique &quot;Ford Ranchero Rio Grande&quot; wheel centers. As a result, Rancheros so equipped received Ford&#x27;s &quot;Special Performance Vehicle&quot; identification on the data plate regardless of engine choice. These vehicles may be identified by the aforementioned designation, as well as a blank space where the trim code would normally be found. Production figures are unclear, but may have been around 900 total units.

At the Detroit motor show in 1969 was shown a concept car Ford Scrambler, some elements of which were used in the next models of Ford Ranchero.

==Fifth generation (1970–1971)==
While Chevrolet&#x27;s El Camino used the same body from 1968 to 1972, 1970 had a complete restyle for the Ranchero, which had started with a boxy body style. Both the Torino and Ranchero featured a shallow-pointed grille and front end with smooth, somewhat more curvaceous lines influenced by coke bottle styling. A fourth trim option was made available in 1970. The Ranchero Squire was an upmarket trim package which featured a woodgrain applique similar to that found on the Country Squire station wagon. Like in previous years, all Torino trim and engine options could be ordered, including all-new Ram-Air 429 Cobra Jet or Super Cobra Jet engines (7 L) with the new &quot;shaker&quot; hood scoop, so named because it was directly mounted to the carburetor and shook with the engine at idle. Also available was a stylish grille that featured hide-away headlamps, as well as an optional hood with an oversized scoop which was standard on Torino GTs. The 1971 is distinguished by a grille divided by a center section.

A minor but nevertheless important variation debuted with the 1970 model. Prior to 1970, no Ranchero had any interior badging identifying it as such. With the 1970 model came a &quot;Ranchero&quot; or &quot;Ranchero GT&quot; badge on the glove compartment rather than Fairlane or Torino badging.


==Sixth generation (1972–1976)==
In 1972, a radical change occurred in the Torino and Ranchero lines. The sleek, pointy look of the previous year&#x27;s model was replaced with a larger, heavier design. Most prominent was a wide semioval grille reminiscent of a jet intake and a new body-on-frame design. Three models were still available; the now-standard 500, the new Squire with simulated woodgrain &quot;paneling&quot; along the flanks, and the sporty GT. Engine choices remained basically the same beginning with the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder and a selection of V8s that ranged from the standard 302 to Cleveland and Windsor series 351s, plus the new-for-1972 400. The 385-series V8 (the 429 for 1972–73; the 460 for 1974–76) was still available. However, all suffered from lower compression ratios to better meet new emissions standards. The Cleveland could still be obtained in tuned 4-V Cobra Jet form through 1974. A four-speed manual transmission was available on Cobra Jet-powered models GT, Squire and 500.

The 1973 Ranchero had a redesigned front end to meet new federal standards for front impact protection. Aside from slight cosmetic differences, the Ranchero remained basically the same until the Torino&#x27;s final year, 1976.

==Seventh generation (1977–1979)==

With the Torino ending production after 1976, the 1977 Ranchero was restyled in line with the Ford LTD II mid-sized car line which replaced the Torino using the same platform. The same three models available since 1968 were still offered and the Ranchero could be ordered in quite luxurious form. Engines fitted went up to the .
Production ceased in 1979 with, among the traditional choices, a commemorative &quot;1979½&quot; model. Although the LTD II-based Ranchero was not produced for many model years, this body style with stacked rectangular headlamps is one of the most popular among collectors. This generation of Ranchero is often customized by swapping onto it any front end clip from a 1972–1976 Mercury Montego, 1974–1979 Mercury Cougar, 1974–1976 Ford Elite, or 1977–1979 Ford Thunderbird, which all have interchangeable front end parts that easily bolt into place.

Cars were getting smaller and increasing government restrictions, and requirements on a car-based pickup truck made such a vehicle less and less attractive from a manufacturing standpoint. Meanwhile, purpose-designed light trucks had to meet much less stringent requirements for emissions and fuel economy. Ford saw the way the market was going and decided small light trucks were the wave of the future, beginning with the Mazda-built Courier pickup. This vehicle would be a &quot;stepping stone&quot; during which time Ford would develop their homegrown replacement, the Ranger.
==Argentine Ranchero==

From 1973 until 1991, Ford Motor Argentina developed and sold a utility version of its own Ford Falcon called the Ford Ranchero. Unlike the American version, it was based on the four-door sedan model, keeping the front part &quot;as is&quot;, and knocking down the rear half to make it a light pick-up. The truck was presented in two versions, the light one with a maximum load capacity of 465 kg (1025 lb) and the heavy one with a capacity of 565 kg (1245 lb), both with 14-inch wheels and having the latter front disc brake. The first generation sold very well, and in 1974, exports began to Cuba.

Later that year, it became the best-selling car in Argentina, with a total of 110,382 sold between 1973 and 1978. Production of the second-generation model lasted from 1978 until 1982, and production of the third generation lasted from 1982 until 1987. In 1987, the fourth and final generation was released and in 1988 a diesel model was added to the lineup for the first time, but it was discontinued as of 1989. Production of the fourth-generation Argentine Ranchero ended in 1991.

==Present day==

Rancheros are reasonably collectible, though they are nowadays often overlooked in favor of the later-arriving Chevrolet El Camino, which stayed in production eight more years. Miniatures, apart from hand-cast resin kits from cottage-industry makers, are rare. Several Revell offerings of the 1957 model in both 1/32 and 1/25 scale have been offered over the years, as has a kit of the 1961 Ranchero by AMT/Ertl. A well-detailed promotional model of 1959 intended for distribution by dealers was offered both with and without interior trim, windows, and friction drive by AMT/Ertl&#x27;s predecessor, SMP; resin castings of this model&#x27;s body are offered by the aforementioned cottage industries, as well. Matchbox produced a 1961 Ford Falcon Ranchero for the 2018 line as well as a 1970 Ford Ranchero for the 2023 line. Johnny Lightning makes a 1964 model, Hot Wheels made an adult collectible &#x27;57 in a limited run. In 2009 Hot Wheels produced a &#x27;72 Ford Ranchero that is still in production today. Hot Wheels also introduced (in 2011) the &#x27;65 Ford Ranchero that has a hard tonneau cover on the bed, and an opening in the hood that reveals the engine beneath. Racing Champions made a 1/64 scale 1957 Ranchero and AMT/Ertl currently produces a diecast &#x27;57 which doubles as a bank. AMT was responsible for other early dealer promotional models, too, including those of the aforementioned El Camino. Tonka produced a resin toy version of the 1968-69 model in roughly 1/24 scale as part of an auto transporter set; the front end of that toy arguably resembles the 1969 model more closely. In 2019, Greenlight Collectibles introduced 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1976 Ranchero models in 1/64 scale. The 1979 Ranchero was made as a 1/18 scale resin model by BOS (Best Of Show) Models.

The idea of a car-based pickup remains an attractive one and is an illustration of how favorable treatment for light trucks over cars by United States regulations skews the marketplace. Many Ranchero and El Camino owners, indeed, stopped buying new vehicles when those models were discontinued. Aftermarket conversions of the Fairmont Futura and Mercury Zephyr Z7 sport coupes to a Ranchero-like &quot;Durango&quot; pickup were sold in select Ford dealers in the early- to mid-1980s. Recently, interest in producing such vehicles again has grown, including those like the Subaru Baja, essentially an Outback station wagon with a stubby pickup bed instead of an enclosed cargo area. The Baja, like the Ranchero, is titled in most American states and Canadian provinces as a commercial vehicle. Until the late-2000s, the North American market tended to lean towards compact and midsized crew-cab four-door pickups such as the Ford Explorer Sport Trac and Chevrolet Colorado. However, with the compact pickups having grown towards midsized and encroaching on base models of more profitable full-sized pickups, some manufacturers such as Ford and Ram Trucks have discontinued even their compact and midsized offerings; Ford discontinued the American Ranger in 2012 and originally opted not to sell its global replacement in North America due to being too close in size and price to the base model Ford F-150, though did eventually introduce it for the 2019 model year.

In Australia, Ford produced a right-hand drive car-based &quot;pickup&quot;, with the FG X Falcon Ute available in style-side or tray-back form. Production of Falcon sedans and utilities ceased in Australia in 2016.

<text>The National Union (, &quot;HaIhud HaLeumi&quot;) was an alliance of right-wing and nationalist political parties in Israel. In its final full form, the alliance consisted of four parties: Moledet, Hatikva, Eretz Yisrael Shelanu, and Tkuma. Leading up to the 2013 Knesset elections, only Tkuma remained, and joined The Jewish Home. During its existence, it had also included Ahi, Herut – The National Movement, the Jewish National Front, and Yisrael Beiteinu.

==Background==

The National Union was formed in 1999 to contest the elections of that year as an alliance between Moledet, Tkuma, and Herut – The National Movement, winning four seats. In 2001, the party&#x27;s support was almost doubled by the addition of the predominantly Russian-immigrant party, Yisrael Beiteinu.

After Ariel Sharon won the 2001 Prime Ministerial elections, National Union was brought into the National Unity Government, and party leader Rehavam Zeevi was appointed Minister of Tourism, with Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman becoming Minister of National Infrastructure. When Zeevi was assassinated on 17 October 2001, Binyamin Elon of Moledet took his ministerial position, and Lieberman became head of the National Union.

Herut ran independently in the 2003 elections, and did not pass the barrier. The National Union party won seven seats, and was included in Ariel Sharon&#x27;s coalition, alongside Likud, Shinui, the National Religious Party, and Yisrael BaAliyah. Elon and Lieberman were appointed Minister of Tourism and Minister of Transportation, respectively.

The National Union opposed the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Sharon sacked ministers Elon and Lieberman, and the National Union left the coalition (Elon attempted to avoid sacking by going into hiding, but ultimately failed).

However, the National Union was then bolstered by the addition of the Renewed Religious National Zionist Party (later renamed Ahi), which had been formed by NRP dissidents opposed to the Gaza withdrawal after the NRP had decided to remain in the coalition. After withdrawal, the National Union adopted orange as its symbol, the color having been used by anti-disengagement protesters.
In 2005, Yisrael Beiteinu left the National Union to run independently in the 2006 elections. At the last minute, the National Religious Party decided to form a joint list with National Union called &quot;National Union - NRP&quot;. The combined list adopted more social policies, and won the support of the chief rabbis of Religious Zionism (such as Rabbi Abraham Shapira), and the Union of Handicapped (thanks to the NRP&#x27;s pro-handicapped legislation). The joint list used the slogan &quot;New Right Rising&quot; (Hebrew: ימין חדש עולה, &quot;Yamin Hadash Oleh&quot;), and won nine seats, of which the National Union took six.

In 2008, in anticipation of the 2009 elections, the National Union and NRP formally unified into a single party, called the Jewish Home. This was intended to unify their political sector and present the public with a new face for the religious Zionist movement. The Jewish Home was to be a single party, rather than a list of separate parties, each with its own agenda and independent leadership. Professor Daniel Hershkowitz was picked to head the newly formed party. However, MK Aryeh Eldad left to form his own list, Hatikva, while MKs Effi Eitam and Yitzhak Levy (formerly of Ahi) re-established Ahi, which later merged into Likud. When the Jewish Home announced its candidate list for the elections, five of the top six slots went to ex-NRP members, with only MK Uri Ariel, formerly of Tkuma, in the top six.

The remaining ex-Moledet members broke off, re-established their party, and allied with MK Eldad&#x27;s Hatikva, reviving the National Union name. Elon stated that he would not seek re-election, and American immigrant Uri Bank took his place on the Jewish Home list. The split from Jewish Home grew, and polls indicated Hatikva could win three seats. Eretz Yisrael Shelanu also joined the National Union, with member Michael Ben-Ari given fourth spot on the alliance&#x27;s list. While these issues were being negotiated, Uri Ariel also left Jewish Home and rejoined the National Union list, leaving Jewish Home as little more than a renamed NRP.

In preparation for the 2013 Knesset elections, the Tkuma faction of the National Union merged with the Jewish Home. Ya&#x27;akov Katz, chairman of the party, asked to be lower on the list of Tkuma members, and soon after resigned from politics. Hatikva and Eretz Yisrael Shelanu broke off, and merged to form Otzma LeYisrael while Moledet and Tkuma merged with the Jewish Home. In the elections held on 22 January 2013, the Jewish Home received 9% of the vote, winning twelve seats in the Knesset.

==Controversy==
National Union had come under scrutiny for its sympathy towards right-wing &quot;price-tag&quot; militants, who engaged in vandalist activities targeting both the state of Israel and Palestinians, including siding with such militants in clashes with Israeli authorities. When a group of &quot;hilltop youth&quot; militants attacked an Israeli army base in late 2011, MK Uri Ariel protested Israeli officials who called the group &quot;terrorists&quot;, and condemned calls for the use of lethal force to repel such attacks in the future. In January 2012, Ariel admitted to giving IDF troop movement information to such militants in order to facilitate disruption of army activities.

In 2009, MK Michael Ben-Ari was arrested after interfering with police attempts to arrest a settler who had been rioting against Palestinians in protest of proposed settlement evacuations. In March 2011, Ben-Ari criticized arrests of settlers who had thrown stones at the police in order to block the service of an arrest warrant, comparing Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch to Muammar Gaddafi and declaring that &quot;his days are numbered&quot;.

In 2012, MK Aryeh Eldad and MK Michael Ben-Ari sparked controversy by calling for asylum seekers entering Israel to be shot.

<text>The Finnish Navy ( , ) is one of the branches of the Finnish Defence Forces. The navy employs 2,300 people and about 4,300 conscripts are trained each year. Finnish Navy vessels are given the ship prefix &quot;FNS&quot;, short for &quot;Finnish Navy ship&quot;, but this is not used in Finnish-language contexts. The Finnish Navy also includes coastal forces and coastal artillery.

== Organization ==
The current Commander of the Navy is rear admiral Tuomas Tiilikainen. The navy is organized into the Navy Command, three Brigade-level units, and the Naval Academy. Since 1998 the navy also includes the Nyland Brigade in Dragsvik, where Finnish Marines or &quot;Coastal Jaegers&quot; are trained. The Nyland Brigade is also the only Swedish-language unit in the country and it carries on the traditions and battle-honours of the Nyland (Uusimaa) Regiment of the Swedish Army.

Total of 31,500 personnel

== History ==
During the Swedish era, the Finnish Gulf saw many battles between the Swedish and Russian fleets. Many of the Swedish naval bases were located in present-day Finland and many sailors came from Finland (see Archipelago Fleet).
During the Russian rule (1809–1917) an entirely Finnish Navy unit, named &quot;Suomen Meriekipaasi&quot; was
defending the Finnish coast, alongside the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy. The &quot;Meriekipaasi&quot; participated in the Crimean War, albeit mostly with on-shore duties. The &quot;Meriekipaasi&quot; also manned the coastal batteries at the Santahamina Island during the siege of fortress Viapori in Helsinki. The ships the &quot;Meriekipaasi&quot; operated included the steam frigates and &quot;Kalevala&quot;, named after the Finnish national epic. These ships later served in the Russian Pacific Fleet.

=== Independent Finland ===
The first ships that the independent Finnish Navy obtained were a mix of obsolete vessels left behind by the Russians during the Finnish Civil War and vessels that had not been able to make the winter voyage to Kronstadt as the Russian Navy retreated from German forces. Thus, the Finnish Navy of the late 1910s and early 1920s consisted of a few gunboats (, , , and ), six S-class torpedo boats, eight C-class torpedo boats, one minelayer (), several minesweepers, and five T-class minelaying boats. In addition to the warships, the Russians also left behind numerous other types of vessels.

Additionally, the Germans handed over two netlayers ( and ) to the Finnish Navy, and these two ships formed the core of the Finnish Navy until the coastal defence ships were commissioned. With the Treaty of Tartu, Finland had to return some of the equipment they had operated earlier. This equipment included three S-class torpedo boats (&quot;S3&quot;, &quot;S4&quot; and &quot;S6&quot;), the minesweepers &quot;Altair&quot;, &quot;Mikula&quot;, &quot;MP 7&quot;, &quot;MP 11&quot;, &quot;Ahvola&quot;, &quot;T 12&quot;, fifteen tugs, four smaller transports and 54 motorboats. Finland lost three more ships (the torpedo boats &quot;C1&quot;, &quot;C2&quot; and &quot;C3&quot;) in supporting the British campaign in the Baltic Sea. The three vessels remained in the Baltic even when winter froze over the sea, and the expanding ice damaged the vessels beyond repair, and they were all scuttled. The last remaining C-class torpedo boats were placed in reserve after this incident.

In 1927, after years of wrangling with various plans for how to modernize the navy, and partly due to the loss of the torpedo boat &quot;S2&quot; in heavy seas in October 1925, the Parliament of Finland approved a plan to build two coastal defence ships (&quot;Panssarilaiva&quot; in Finnish), as well as four submarines. Motor torpedo boats were also acquired both from Britain, as well as from domestic sources. New minesweepers were also constructed. The training ship was also acquired.

=== World War II ===
The strength of the Finnish Navy at the beginning of World War II was limited. Some of the planned ships had not yet been constructed and wartime constraints on the economy prolonged ship building times.

The Finnish Navy operated the following vessels in the Baltic Sea:
* Two coastal defence ships ( and )
* Five submarines (, , , and )
* Four gunboats (, , and )
* Seven motor torpedo boats (two , one , four )
* One minelayer ()
* Eight minesweepers (six , two )
* One training ship 

On Lake Ladoga, the Finns operated:
* One icebreaker (&quot;Aallokas&quot;)
* One gunboat (&quot;Aunus&quot;)
* One minelayer (&quot;Yrjö&quot;)
* One tug (&quot;Vakava&quot;)
* Two motor boats (&quot;S 1&quot; and &quot;N. K. af Klercker&quot;)

The navy also had several auxiliary warships, icebreakers and patrol boats from the coast guard.
==== Winter War ====
When the Winter War broke out the Finnish Navy moved to occupy the de-militarized Åland Islands and to protect merchant shipping. In the first month of the war, battles between Soviet ships and Finnish coastal batteries were fought at Hanko, Finland, Utö and Koivisto. At Koivisto and Hanko, the batteries forced Soviet battleships to retire with damage. Finnish efforts to use submarines ( and ) to sink Soviet capital ships failed. In December 1939 the ice became so thick that only the icebreakers could still move. The two coastal defence ships were moved to the harbour in Turku where they were used to strengthen the air defences of the city. They remained there for the rest of the war.

==== Continuation War ====
Before the Continuation War five more torpedo boats were ordered from Italy. The base that the Soviets had acquired after the Winter War at the Hanko Peninsula divided the areas where the Finnish Navy would operate in two. This included the coastal artillery positions at Russarö and Osmussaar, which guarded the minefields blocking the entrance to the Eastern Gulf of Finland. Large mine fields were laid down in cooperation with the German Kriegsmarine when the war began. The coastal defence ships bombarded the Soviet base at Hanko until the Soviets evacuated Hanko in December 1941.

Between 1941 and 1945 some 69,779 mines and mine sweeping obstacles were laid in the Gulf of Finland by Finnish, Soviet and German naval forces. The Soviet Navy laid 16,179 mines and 2,441 mine sweeping obstacles, the Finnish navy 6,382 mines, and the German navy&#x27;s vessels, submarines and aircraft laid some 45,000 mines, of which 3,000 were magnetic mines. The last mine sweeping season was held in 1957, but the mine danger continued for some 10 more years, and there are still hundreds of World War II-era mines in the Baltic Sea. The greatest loss of the Finnish Navy occurred on 13 September 1941 when ran into a mine and sank. 271 sailors died and only 132 were rescued. Most of the survivors later served in the Lake Onega flotilla, using old captured ships, including a steam-engined paddlewheeler.

In 1942 the main focus of the war at sea was on anti-submarine warfare. Finnish and German naval forces tried to prevent Soviet submarines from gaining access to the Baltic Sea. However, the mine barrier had proven to be insufficient to completely stop Soviet submarines activities. The Soviet subs sank 18 ships, seven of which were Finnish. 12 Soviet submarines were also sunk - three by Finnish submarines. The next step in submarine warfare was to completely block the Gulf of Finland with anti-submarine nets between Naissaar and Porkkala. This was done immediately after the ice cover melted on the sea. That barrier with its accompanying minefields effectively contained Soviet Naval vessels to the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland until the autumn of 1944, when the Soviets were able to use Finnish coastal seaways to circumvent the barrier.

In spring 1942 Finnish forces captured the island of Gogland. In July 1942 the Soviets made an attempt to occupy the small island of Sommers in the Gulf of Finland. The Soviets lost several smaller vessels (patrol and torpedo boats) together with 128 men. One-hundred and two Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner. During 1943 the navy received 14 new motor torpedo boats which were used to replace the old pre-war ones.

In 1944 the Soviets launched a major offensive against Finland, during which the navy fought in support of Finnish land forces the Gulf of Vyborg. In the end the ships were forced to pull out.
==== Lapland War ====
In September 1944, the military operations against Germany started. The main focus was in the north, the Lapland War, but the Germans also tried to capture Suursaari in an operation named &quot;Tanne Ost&quot;. The attack was repulsed. During the battle, Finnish motor torpedo boats sank several German vessels.

The last action of the Finnish Navy was during the amphibious landing of troops from Oulu in Tornio. The Finnish gunboats successfully shelled German batteries, which had posed serious threat for the transport ships, while their anti-aircraft batteries defended the convoy from German air attacks. The navy also hunted German U-boats in the Baltic, laying its last mines of the war while doing this.

After the Finnish-Soviet armistice, the Finnish Navy was ordered to participate in the demanding mine clearance operation. The operation lasted until 1950. There were many casualties among the clearance crews.

===The Cold War era===

The war time fleet was replaced in the 1950s and 1960s. Due to Finland&#x27;s neutrality she tried to balance her purchases of equipment between the two blocs and also tried to produce its own vessels. A (&quot;Matti Kurki&quot;) for training purposes, two fast patrol boats (&quot;Vasama 1&quot; and &quot;Vasama 2&quot;) and four s were bought from the UK, two s ( and ) and four Osa II-class fast attack craft (s) were obtained from the Soviet Union. Some of the vessels, such as two s ( and ) and the Nuoli-class fast attack craft were produced domestically.

The Paris peace talks in 1947 resulted in a treaty that limited the offensive capability of the Finnish military. For the navy, this meant a limitation to a fleet of no more than 10,000 tons and 4,500 personnel. As for the weaponry, torpedoes, submarines, mines and missiles were forbidden. The restrictions were eased in the 1960s and missiles and mines were allowed. The torpedo restriction was not either fully exercised as the Riga-class frigates were equipped with torpedoes and a number of torpedo boats were manufactured as gunboats that could quickly be converted to carry torpedoes. Torpedoes were re-introduced in 2018.

The Cold War limitations are no longer in place (they were nullified with the breakup of the Soviet Union), but the size of the navy has still remained roughly the same size (with the exception of tonnage).

=== Current status ===
In the late 1990s, the Finnish Navy was developing a new missile squadron called &quot;Laivue 2000&quot; (). At first it was supposed to consist of two &quot;Hamina&quot;-class missile boats (already built at this date) and four hovercraft. The Navy experimented with one prototype hovercraft, but announced in 2003 that the &quot;Tuuli&quot; class would not enter active operations and that no more of them would be built. Instead two new &quot;Hamina&quot;-class missile boats were built, and the extra weaponry from the hovercraft were installed on the &quot;Hämeenmaa&quot;-class minelayers.

Once Squadron 2000 was operational, the Navy shifted its attention to mine countermeasures with a view to replacing the old Kuha- and Kiiski-class minesweepers with three s, previously known as the MCMV 2010 and MITO classes.

The cable layer and pollution control vessel were replaced in 2011 by a new multipurpose vessel built by the &quot;Uudenkaupungin Työvene&quot; shipyard. A new icebreaking oil spill response vessel was named on 8 March 2011.

The 1979-built minelayer was decommissioned in 2013, after which the minelayer &quot;Hämeenmaa&quot; took over the role of flagship of the Finnish Navy.

In February 2015, it was reported that fatigue damage had been discovered in the hulls of the recently refitted &quot;Rauma&quot;-class missile boats and that the vessels would be removed from active duty to prevent further damage until its cause has been found. However, while peacetime use is now limited, the missile boats can be taken back into full service if needed.

In 2018 Finnish Navy announced procurement of IAI&#x27;s Gabriel 5 naval strike missile system. The system will replace the current maritime anti-ship missile 85M (SAAB RBS15) system, which will reach the end of its life cycle in the 2020s. The new PTO2020 missiles will be installed on Hamina- and Pohjanmaa- class ships and vehicle platforms. The planned life cycle of the system extends to the 2050s. As the Finnish Defence Forces are building multi-branch joint strike capability and Gabriel 5 is capable of strikes to both naval and land domain, the new missile was given designation of PTO2020, (Pinta Torjunta Ohjus 2020 or Surface Strike Missile 2020) instead of old designation(Anti Ship Missile).

=== Future vessels ===

In October 2012, The Finnish Navy signed a 34 million euro contract for 12 fast transport boats with an option for more vessels with Marine Alutech, a Finnish company that had also built the &quot;Uisko&quot;- and &quot;Jurmo&quot;-class transport boats. The &quot;Jehu&quot; transport boats can carry 25 troops and have a maximum speed in excess of . Defensive capability is provided by a remotely controlled turret capable of providing fire support during a landing operation. The new class of landing craft has been named the .

The next-generation surface combatant, which will be larger than the current missile boats and more capable for international co-operation, is currently under construction. This new class of multi-purpose naval vessels, referred to as &quot;Monitoimialus 2020&quot; (&quot;Multi-purpose vessel 2020&quot;) or &quot;Laivue 2020&quot; (&quot;Squadron 2020&quot;) in the preliminary papers, is intended to replace the &quot;Hämeenmaa&quot;- and &quot;Pohjanmaa&quot;-class minelayers and &quot;Rauma&quot;-class missile boats as they are retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;finlex12/2010&quot;&gt;Hallituksen esitys 12/2010. FINLEX.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to replace seven vessels with four new corvette-sized surface combatants. In September 2015, the Finnish Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö officially authorized the Finnish Navy to start developing &quot;Squadron 2020&quot; and an official Request for Information (RFI) was sent to shipyards in December. Consequently, the Finnish Defence Forces signed a letter of intent with Rauma Marine Constructions for the construction of four vessels under the &quot;Squadron 2020&quot; program on 14 September 2016. The projected cost of four vessels with a lifespan of at least 35 years is roughly 1.2 billion euro. The new vessels will be called the .

On 5 May 2021 the Finnish Ministry of Defence announced that the Finnish Navy was to obtain four Kewatec Work 1920 vessels for delivery between 2022 and 2024. The deal included options for five additional vessels. The contract (including options) is valued 12.8 million Euros.

An additional 17 Jurmo-class vessels were ordered on 29 June 2023.

== Equipment ==

=== Vessels ===
====Fast attack craft====
* Four &quot;Hamina&quot;-class fast attack craft
* Four &quot;Rauma&quot;-class fast attack craft

====Mine warfare====

=== Coastal forces ===
Coastal forces include both coastal infantry and the Marines (&quot;Coastal Jaegers&quot;) as well as the remnants of the coastal artillery units, which have moved from fixed and towed guns to truck-mounted and infantry-carried anti-ship missiles. The towed guns have been phased out as obsolete and all artillery-based coastal defences are to be retired in the near future.

* Spike-ER coastal missiles (infantry carried)
* MTO-85M anti-ship missiles, truck mounted (SAAB RBS-15SF)
* Coastal artillery with fixed turrets (130 53 TK)
* BOR-A 550 ground and coastal surveillance radar (GSR)

The Euro-Spike coastal missile system was taken into use in 2005 at the Uusimaa Brigade and the older truck-mounted RBS-15 missiles have been complemented with new, upgraded RBS-15 Mk.3 (known as &quot;MTO-85M&quot;).

<text>Combinatorial game theory measures game complexity in several ways: 

#State-space complexity (the number of legal game positions from the initial position)
#Game tree size (total number of possible games)
#Decision complexity (number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree for initial position)
#Game-tree complexity (number of leaf nodes in the smallest full-width decision tree for initial position)
#Computational complexity (asymptotic difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large)

These measures involve understanding the game positions, possible outcomes, and computational complexity of various game scenarios.

==Measures of game complexity==

=== State-space complexity ===
The &quot;state-space complexity&quot; of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.

When this is too hard to calculate, an upper bound can often be computed by also counting (some) illegal positions (positions that can never arise in the course of a game).

=== Game tree size ===
The &quot;game tree size&quot; is the total number of possible games that can be played. This is the number of leaf nodes in the game tree rooted at the game&#x27;s initial position.

The game tree is typically vastly larger than the state-space because the same positions can occur in many games by making moves in a different order (for example, in a tic-tac-toe game with two X and one O on the board, this position could have been reached in two different ways depending on where the first X was placed). An upper bound for the size of the game tree can sometimes be computed by simplifying the game in a way that only increases the size of the game tree (for example, by allowing illegal moves) until it becomes tractable.

For games where the number of moves is not limited (for example by the size of the board, or by a rule about repetition of position) the game tree is generally infinite.

=== Decision trees ===
A decision tree is a subtree of the game tree, with each position labelled &quot;player A wins&quot;, &quot;player B wins&quot;, or &quot;draw&quot; if that position can be proved to have that value (assuming best play by both sides) by examining only other positions in the graph. Terminal positions can be labelled directly—with player A to move, a position can be labelled &quot;player A wins&quot; if any successor position is a win for A; &quot;player B wins&quot; if all successor positions are wins for B; or &quot;draw&quot; if all successor positions are either drawn or wins for B. (With player B to move, corresponding positions are marked similarly.)

The following two methods of measuring game complexity use decision trees:

==== Decision complexity ====
&quot;Decision complexity&quot; of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.

==== Game-tree complexity ====
&quot;Game-tree complexity&quot; of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest &quot;full-width&quot; decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position. A full-width tree includes all nodes at each depth. This is an estimate of the number of positions one would have to evaluate in a minimax search to determine the value of the initial position.

It is hard even to estimate the game-tree complexity, but for some games an approximation can be given by formula_1, where is the game&#x27;s average branching factor and &quot;&quot; is the number of plies in an average game.

=== Computational complexity ===
The &quot;computational complexity&quot; of a game describes the asymptotic difficulty of a game as it grows arbitrarily large, expressed in big O notation or as membership in a complexity class. This concept doesn&#x27;t apply to particular games, but rather to games that have been generalized so they can be made arbitrarily large, typically by playing them on an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; board. (From the point of view of computational complexity, a game on a fixed size of board is a finite problem that can be solved in O(1), for example by a look-up table from positions to the best move in each position.)

The asymptotic complexity is defined by the most efficient algorithm for solving the game (in terms of whatever computational resource one is considering). The most common complexity measure, computation time, is always lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity, since a solution algorithm must work for every possible state of the game. It will be upper-bounded by the complexity of any particular algorithm that works for the family of games. Similar remarks apply to the second-most commonly used complexity measure, the amount of space or computer memory used by the computation. It is not obvious that there is any lower bound on the space complexity for a typical game, because the algorithm need not store game states; however many games of interest are known to be PSPACE-hard, and it follows that their space complexity will be lower-bounded by the logarithm of the asymptotic state-space complexity as well (technically the bound is only a polynomial in this quantity; but it is usually known to be linear).
* The depth-first minimax strategy will use computation time proportional to the game&#x27;s tree-complexity (since it must explore the whole tree), and an amount of memory polynomial in the logarithm of the tree-complexity (since the algorithm must always store one node of the tree at each possible move-depth, and the number of nodes at the highest move-depth is precisely the tree-complexity).
* Backward induction will use both memory and time proportional to the state-space complexity, as it must compute and record the correct move for each possible position.

==Example: tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses)==
For tic-tac-toe, a simple upper bound for the size of the state space is 39 = 19,683. (There are three states for each of the nine cells.) This count includes many illegal positions, such as a position with five crosses and no noughts, or a position in which both players have a row of three. A more careful count, removing these illegal positions, gives 5,478. And when rotations and reflections of positions are considered identical, there are only 765 essentially different positions.

To bound the game tree, there are 9 possible initial moves, 8 possible responses, and so on, so that there are at most 9! or 362,880 total games. However, games may take less than 9 moves to resolve, and an exact enumeration gives 255,168 possible games. When rotations and reflections of positions are considered the same, there are only 26,830 possible games.

The computational complexity of tic-tac-toe depends on how it is generalized. A natural generalization is to &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-games: played on an &quot;m&quot; by &quot;n&quot; board with winner being the first player to get &quot;k&quot; in a row. This game can be solved in DSPACE(&quot;mn&quot;) by searching the entire game tree. This places it in the important complexity class PSPACE; with more work, it can be shown to be PSPACE-complete.

==Complexities of some well-known games==
Due to the large size of game complexities, this table gives the ceiling of their logarithm to base 10. (In other words, the number of digits). All of the following numbers should be considered with caution: seemingly minor changes to the rules of a game can change the numbers (which are often rough estimates anyway) by tremendous factors, which might easily be much greater than the numbers shown.

<text>is a Japanese singer, songwriter, and lyricist for various anime theme songs and shows, including &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot;, &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;, &quot;Macross Plus&quot;, &quot;Outlaw Star&quot;, &quot;Kaze no Stigma&quot;, &quot;Maoyu&quot;, and &quot;Aria The Origination&quot;.

==Biography==
Arai joined Victor Music Entertainment after graduating from university. She worked on collaborations with various artists there. Her first single, &quot;Yakusoku&quot; was released in 1986, and was used as an insert song for the anime &quot;Windaria&quot;. She also released the album &quot;Natsukashii Mirai&quot;. In 1988 she left her agency. In 1992, she released the singles &quot;Kaze to Tori to Sora ~reincarnation~&quot; and &quot;Kooru Suna&quot; which were used as songs for the &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot; anime and &quot;The Weathering Continent&quot; drama CD, respectively.

Her activity in anime continued with &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;. In 1994, she sang &quot;Voices&quot; for the &quot;Macross Plus&quot; OVA, where she also was the singing voice for Myung Fang Lone and Sharon Apple. She would later release her first compilation album &quot;Sora no mori&quot; in 1997. She wrote and performed the two ending songs for the 1998 anime &quot;Outlaw Star&quot; and contributed songs for &quot;Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight&quot;. In 1999, she released &quot;Kanaete&quot; for the &quot;Puppet Master Sakon&quot; anime. In 2001, she released &quot;Hana no katachi&quot; as a song for the &quot;Daichis - Earth Defense Family&quot;. &quot;Kakusei Toshi&quot; was released for &quot;Tokyo Underground&quot; in 2002, and &quot;Natsukashii umi&quot; was an opener song for &quot;&quot;.

In 2009, she performed the opening theme &quot;Mitsu no Yoake&quot; (蜜の夜明け) for the anime television series &quot;Spice and Wolf II&quot; in 2009, and the ending theme Unknown Vision for &quot;Maoyu&quot; in 2013. In 2012, she provided music for Shibuya International&#x27;s 10th anniversary short film called &quot;Birth&quot;.

Arai has performed at many conventions, music festivals, and clubs. In 2005, she celebrated her 20th anniversary in her music career with the compilation album, &quot;Sora no Uta&quot;, and went on tour to France and Germany in 2006. On March 24, 2013, she performed at Hong Kong Polytechnic University as her first live concert appearance in Asia outside Japan.

Arai has worked with many different music artists. In 1989, she joined Tomoko Tane on some of her albums. She also worked with Yuri Shiratori and composed tracks for the latter&#x27;s album. In 1998, she and Yayoi Yula released the album &quot;Goddess in the morning&quot;. She joined a band called Marsh-mallow which released an eponymous album in 2001. In 2011, she worked with a new music group, releasing &quot;RuRu Chapeau&quot;.

Arai hosted a weekly hour-long radio show called &quot;Viridian House&quot; and has also named her website after that.

<text>Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—such as a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.

==Overview==
On its own, circumstantial evidence allows for more than one explanation. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence may be required, so that each corroborates the conclusions drawn from the others. Together, they may more strongly support one particular inference over another. An explanation involving circumstantial evidence becomes more likely once alternative explanations have been ruled out. Circumstantial evidence allows a trier of fact to infer that a fact exists. In criminal law, the inference is made by the trier of fact to support the truth of an assertion (of guilt or absence of guilt).

Reasonable doubt is tied into circumstantial evidence as that evidence relies on inference. It was put in place because the circumstantial evidence may not be enough to convict someone fairly. Reasonable doubt is described as the highest standard of proof used in court and means that a juror can find the defendant guilty of the crime to a moral certainty. Even when circumstantial evidence is not sufficient to convict or acquit, it can contribute to other decisions made about the case.

Testimony can be direct evidence or it can be circumstantial. For example, a witness saying that she saw a defendant stab a victim is providing direct evidence. By contrast, a witness saying that she saw a defendant enter a house, heard screaming, and saw the defendant leave with a bloody knife is circumstantial evidence. It is the need for inference, and not the obviousness of the fact inferred, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.

Forensic evidence supplied by an expert witness is usually treated as circumstantial evidence. For example, a forensic scientist or forensic engineer may provide results of tests indicating that bullets were fired from a defendant&#x27;s gun, or that a car was traveling over the speed limit, but not necessarily that the defendant fired the gun or was driving the car. Circumstantial evidence is especially important when there is little or no direct evidence.

==Civil law==
Circumstantial evidence is used in civil courts to establish or refute liability. It is usually the most common form of evidence, for example in product liability cases and road traffic accidents. Forensic analysis of skid marks can frequently allow a reconstruction of the accident. By measuring the length of such marks and using dynamic analysis of the car and road conditions at the time of the accident, it may be found that a driver underestimated his or her speed. Circumstantial evidence is also prevalent in attempts to recover damages from alleged tortfeasors.

==Criminal law==
Circumstantial evidence is used in criminal courts to establish guilt or innocence through reasoning. With obvious exceptions (immature, incompetent, or mentally ill individuals), most criminals try to avoid generating direct evidence. Hence, the prosecution usually must resort to circumstantial evidence to prove the existence of &quot;mens rea&quot;, or intent.

One example of circumstantial evidence is the behavior of a person around the time of an alleged offense. In the case of someone charged with theft of money, were the suspect seen in a shopping spree purchasing expensive items shortly after the time of the alleged theft, the spree might prove to be circumstantial evidence of the individual&#x27;s guilt.

===Forensic evidence===

Other examples of circumstantial evidence are fingerprint analysis, blood analysis or DNA analysis of the evidence found at the scene of a crime. These types of evidence may strongly point to a certain conclusion when taken into consideration with other facts—but if not directly witnessed by someone when the crime was committed, they are still considered circumstantial. However, when proved by expert witnesses, they are usually sufficient to decide a case, especially in the absence of any direct evidence. Owing to subsequent developments in forensic methods, old undecided cases (or cold cases) are frequently resolved.

===Validity of circumstantial evidence===
A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence, which is popularly assumed to be the most powerful, but this is not the case. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. The common metaphor for the strongest possible evidence in any case—the &quot;smoking gun&quot;—is an example of proof based on circumstantial evidence. Similarly, fingerprint evidence, videotapes, sound recordings, photographs, and many other examples of physical evidence that support the drawing of an inference, i.e., circumstantial evidence, are considered very strong possible evidence.

In practice, circumstantial evidence can have an advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other. Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times, and many persons have been convicted on the basis of perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony. Thus, strong circumstantial evidence can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission. This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the authenticating witness, is giving direct (eyewitness) testimony, and could present credibility problems in the same way that any eyewitness does.

Eyewitness testimony is frequently unreliable, or subject to conflict or outright fabrication. For example, the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; sank in the presence of approximately 700 witnesses. For many years, there was vigorous debate on whether the ship broke into two before sinking. It was not until the ship was found, in September 1985, that the truth was known. However, there is often more than one logical conclusion naturally inferred from the same set of circumstances. In cases where one conclusion implies a defendant&#x27;s guilt and another his innocence, the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; principle would apply. If the circumstantial evidence suggests a possibility of innocence, the prosecution has the burden of disproving that possibility.

====Examples====
Much of the evidence against convicted American terrorist Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial. Speaking about McVeigh&#x27;s trial, Robert Precht said, &quot;the prosecution&#x27;s use of indirect evidence is no cause for worry&quot;. McVeigh was sentenced to death and subsequently executed by the US federal government, while his accomplice was sentenced to serve consecutive federal life sentences. The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson for the murder of his wife Laci Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence, leading to Peterson&#x27;s being sentenced to death (he was subsequently spared execution and currently awaits re-sentencing). Another case that relied on circumstantial evidence was that of Nelson Serrano, who received four death sentences for four first-degree murders. The 2015 murder trial of Ivan Chan Man-sum from Hong Kong was a conviction based &quot;solely&quot; on circumstantial evidence without finding the body of his murdered girlfriend. Chan was consequently sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment.

In Singapore, law student Sunny Ang was sentenced to death in 1965 solely based on circumstantial evidence when he was convicted of murdering his girlfriend during a scuba diving trip near Sisters&#x27; Islands on 27 August 1963. The victim, Jenny Cheok, was murdered for her insurance money, which amounted to $450,000. Her body has never been found. The additional absence of Cheok&#x27;s body made Ang&#x27;s conviction one of the landmark verdicts in Singapore, where it involved a murder conviction without a body.

A famous aphorism on the probity of circumstantial evidence was penned by Henry David Thoreau: &quot;Some circumstantial evidence is very strong, as when you find a trout in the milk.&quot;

<doc id="317426" wikidata="Q616510" url="?curid=317426" title="Gold dust day gecko">
<text>The gold dust day gecko (Phelsuma laticauda) is a diurnal species of gecko. It lives in northern Madagascar, the Comoro Islands, and the Mascarene Islands; it has also been introduced to Hawaii and other Pacific islands. It is primarily an arboreal species which can be found in tropical forests and may also associate with human dwellings. The gold dust day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

One subspecies is recognized (in addition to the nominate one): &quot;Phelsuma laticauda angularis&quot;.

==Description==
This lizard can reach a total length of 3.9–5.1″ (10–13cm). The body colour is a bright green or yellowish green or rarely blue. Typical for this day gecko are the red speckles on the neck and the upper back. There are three rust-coloured transverse bars on the snout and head; the upper part of the skin around the eye is blue. On the lower back there are three tapering red bars. The tail is slightly flattened. The under side is off-white. Juveniles lack the red colourations and the tail and limbs appear off-white.

==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates, and are capable of eating other smaller lizards. They also eat soft, sweet fruit and pollen and nectar from flowers, often congregating in groups of many individuals to feed off of one plant.

==Behavior==

The males of this species are rather aggressive. They do not accept other males in their territory. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males may also seriously wound a female.

==Reproduction==
The females lay 1–2 eggs. At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 40–45 days. The juveniles measure 55–60 mm. They should be kept separately since the juveniles can be quite quarrelsome. Sexual maturity is reached after 10–12 months.

==Captivity==
This gecko is occasionally kept as a pet; with good care, this species may live up to 15 years.

<text>The Finnish Air Force (FAF or FiAF; ; ) is one of the branches of the Finnish Defence Forces. Its peacetime tasks are airspace surveillance, identification flights, and production of readiness formations for wartime conditions. The Finnish Air Force was founded on 6 March 1918.

==History==
The Finnish Air Force, one of the oldest air forces of the world, pre-dates the British RAF (founded as an independent entity on 1 April 1918) and the Swedish (founded on 1 July 1926). The first steps in the history of Finnish aviation involved Russian aircraft. The Russian military had a number of early designs stationed in the Grand Duchy of Finland, which until the Russian Revolution of 1917 formed an autonomous grand duchy under the Russian Empire. Soon after the Finnish declaration of independence of 6 December 1917, the Finnish Civil War of January to May 1918 broke out, in which the Soviets sided with the &quot;Reds&quot; – the socialist rebels with ties to Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik Party. Finland&#x27;s White Guard, the &quot;Whites&quot;, managed to seize a few aircraft from the Soviets, but were forced to rely on foreign pilots and aircraft. Sweden refused to send men and materiel, but individual Swedish citizens came to the aid of the &quot;Whites&quot;. The editor of the Swedish newspaper , Valdemar Langlet, bought a N.A.B. Albatros aircraft from the Nordiska Aviatik A.B. factory with funds gathered by the organization. This aircraft, the first to arrive from Sweden, was flown via Haparanda on 25 February 1918 by Swedish pilot John-Allan Hygerth (who on 10 March became the first commander of the Finnish Air Force) and Per Svanbäck. The aircraft made a stop at Kokkola and had to make a forced landing in Jakobstad when its engine broke down. It was later given the Finnish Air Force designation F.2 (&quot;F&quot; coming from the Swedish word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;aircraft&quot;).

===Insignia of the Finnish Air Force (1918–1945)===


Swedish count Eric von Rosen gave the Finnish White government its second aircraft, a Thulin Typ D. Von Rosen, later one of the founding members of the &quot;Nationalsocialistiska Blocket&quot; (&quot;National Socialist Bloc&quot;), a Swedish National Socialist political party, and brother-in-law to Hermann Goering, had painted his personal good-luck charm on the Thulin Type D aircraft. This logo – a blue swastika, the ancient symbol of the sun and of good luck, which was back then still used with non-political connotations – gave rise to the insignia of the Finnish Air Force. The white circular background originated when the Finns painted over the advertisement from the Thulin air academy. The swastika was officially taken into use after an order by Commander-in-Chief C. G. E. Mannerheim on 18 March 1918. The FAF changed its aircraft insignia, which resembled the swastika of the Third Reich, after 1944 due to an Allied Control Commission decree, which prohibited fascist organizations. It nevertheless continues to feature in some unit emblems, unit flags and decorations, including on uniforms. In 2020, the BBC reported that the FAF had &quot;quietly stopped&quot; using the symbol in the emblem of the Air Force Command.

===First aircraft===
The von Rosen aircraft received the designation F.1. Its pilot, Lieutenant Nils Kindberg, flew the aircraft to Vaasa on 6 March 1918, carrying von Rosen as a passenger. As this gift ran counter to the policy of the Swedish government, and no flight permit had been granted, Sweden fined Kindberg 100 Swedish crowns for leaving the country without permission. The F.1 aircraft is considered by some to be the first aircraft of the Finnish Air Force, which did not exist during the Civil War, while the &quot;Red&quot; side flew a few aircraft with the help of some Russian pilots. The F.1 aircraft was destroyed in an accident which killed its crew, not long after it had been handed over to the Finns. On 7 September 1920, two newly purchased Savoia flying boats crashed in the Swiss Alps &quot;en route&quot; to Finland, killing all on-board (three Finns and one Italian). This day has since become the memorial day for fallen pilots.

The Finnish Air Force assigns the matriculation numbers to its aircraft by assigning each type a two-letter code following by dash and an individual aircraft number. The two-letter code usually refers to the aircraft manufacturer or model, such as HN for F/A-18 Hornet, DK for Saab 35 Draken, VN for Valmet Vinka etc.

===Finnish Civil War, January to May 1918===
====Air activity of the Reds====
The Whites occupied most of the airbases that the Russians left in Finland after the Russian pilots had returned to Russia.

The Reds possessed a few airbases and a few Russian aircraft, mainly amphibious aircraft – they had 12 aircraft in all. The Reds did not have any pilots themselves, so they hired some of the Russian pilots who had stayed behind. On 24 February 1918 five aircraft arrived at Viipuri, and were quickly transferred to Riihimäki.

The Reds established air units in Helsinki, Tampere, Kouvola, and Viipuri. There were no overall headquarters, but the individual units served under the commanders of the individual front lines. A flight school was set up in Helsinki, but no students were trained there before the fall of Helsinki.

Two of the aircraft, one reconnaissance aircraft (Nieuport 10) and one fighter aircraft (Nieuport 17) that had arrived at Riihimäki were sent to Tampere, and three to Kouvola. Four Russian pilots and six mechanics also arrived at Tampere. The first war sortie was flown on 1 March 1918 over Naistenlahti.

It seems likely that the Reds also operated two aircraft over the Eastern front. The Reds mainly performed reconnaissance, bombing sorties, spreading of propaganda leaflets, and artillery spotting. The Reds&#x27; air activity was not particularly successful. Their air operations suffered from bad leadership, worn-out aircraft, and un-motivated Russian pilots. Some of the aircraft were captured by the Whites, while the rest were destroyed.

====Air activity of the Whites====
In January 1918, the Whites did not have a single aircraft, let alone pilots, so they asked the Swedes for help. Sweden, a neutral country, could not send any official help. Sweden also forbade its pilots to aid Finland.

Despite this official stance, however, one Morane-Saulnier Parasol, and three N.A.B. Albatros arrived from Sweden by the end of February 1918. Two of the Albatross aircraft were gifts from private citizens supporting the White Finnish cause, while the third was purchased. It was initially intended that the aircraft would support the air operations of the Whites, but the aircraft ultimately proved unsuitable.

Along with aircraft shortages, the Whites also did not have any personnel, so all the pilots and mechanics also came from Sweden. One of the Finnish Jägers, Lieutenant Bertil Månsson, had received pilot training in Imperial Germany, but he stayed behind in Germany, trying to secure further aircraft deals for Finland.

During the Civil War the White Finnish Air Force consisted of:

* 29 Swedes (16 pilots, two observers and 11 mechanics). Of the pilots, only 4 had received military training, and one of them operated as an observer.
* 2 Danes (one pilot, one observer)
* 7 Russians (six pilots, one observer)
* 28 Finns (four pilots – of whom two had military training, six observers, two engineers and 16 mechanics).

The air activity consisted mainly of reconnaissance sorties. The Germans brought several of their own aircraft, but they did not contribute much to the overall outcome of the war.

The first air-force base of independent Finland was founded on a lake shore near Kolho. The base could operate three aircraft. The first aircraft arrived by rail on 7 March 1918, and on 17 March 1918 took off from the base for the first time. In 1918 the Finns took over nine Russian Stetinin M-9 aircraft that had been left behind.

The first air operation of the Whites during the war was flown over Lyly. It was a reconnaissance-gathering mission as the front-line moved south. As the line neared Tampere, the base moved first to Orivesi and then to Kaukajärvi near Tampere. The contribution of the White air force during the war was almost insignificant.

From 10 March 1918, the Swedish Lt. John-Allan Hygerth led the Finnish Air Force. He was however replaced on 18 April 1918, due to his unsuitability for the position and numerous accidents. The German Captain Carl Seber took over the role and commanded the air force from 28 April 1918 until 13 December 1918.

By the end of the Civil War, the Finnish Air Force had 40 aircraft, of which 20 had been captured from the Reds (the Reds did not operate this many aircraft, but some had been found abandoned on Åland). Five of the aircraft had been flown by the Allies from Russia, four had been gifts from Sweden and eight had been bought from Germany.

===Winter War (1939–1940)===
The Winter War began on 30 November 1939, when the Soviet Air Force bombed 21 Finnish cities and municipalities. The Soviet Union had an estimated 5,000 aircraft in 1939, and of these, some 700 fighters and 800 medium bombers came to the Finnish front to support the Red Army&#x27;s operations. As with most aerial bombardments in the early stages of World War II, the damage to Finnish industry and railways was quite limited.

At the beginning of the Winter War, the Finnish Air Force was equipped with only 18 Bristol Blenheim bombers and 46 fighters (32 modern Fokker D.XXIs and 14 obsolete Bristol Bulldogs). There were also 58 liaison aircraft, but 20 of these were only used for messengers. The most modern aircraft in the Finnish arsenal were British-designed and -built Bristol Blenheim bombers. The primary fighter aircraft, the Fokker D.XXI, featured a cheap but maneuverable design with fabric-covered fuselage and fixed landing-gear. On paper, the Finnish air assets should have been no match for the attacking Soviet Red Air Force. However, the Finnish Air Force had already adopted the finger-four formation in the mid-1930s, which proved a much more effective formation than the Vic formation that many other militaries continued to use in 1939.

To prevent their aircraft from being destroyed on the ground, the Finns distributed their aircraft to many different airfields and hid them in the nearby forests. The Finns constructed many decoys and built shrapnel-protection walls for the aircraft. Soviet air-raids on Finnish airfields usually caused little or no damage as a result, and often resulted in interception of the attackers by the Finns as the Soviet bombers flew homeward.

As the war progressed, the Finns tried desperately to purchase aircraft wherever they could. This policy resulted in a very diverse aircraft inventory, which caused some major logistical problems until the inventory became more standardized. The Finnish Air Force included numerous American, British, Czechoslovakian, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Soviet, and Swedish designs. Other countries, like South Africa and Denmark, sent aircraft to assist in the Finnish war effort. Many of these purchases and gifts did not arrive until the end of the hostilities, but would see action later during the Continuation and Lapland wars.

To make up for its weaknesses (few and obsolete fighters) the FAF mainly focused on attacking enemy bombers from directions that were disadvantageous to the enemy. Soviet fighters were usually superior in firepower, speed and agility, and Finnish pilots avoided them unless the enemy was in a disadvantageous position.

As a result of these tactics, the Finnish Air Force managed to shoot down 218 Soviet aircraft during the Winter War while losing only 47 to enemy fire. Finnish anti-aircraft guns also had 314 confirmed downed enemy planes. 30 Soviet planes were captured – these were &quot;kills&quot; that landed more or less intact within Finland and were quickly repaired.

===Continuation War (1941–1944)===
The Finnish Air Force found itself better prepared when the Continuation War against the Soviet Union started in 1941. It had been considerably strengthened and consisted of some 550 aircraft, though many were considered second-rate and thus &quot;exportable&quot; by their countries of origin. Finland purchased a large number of aircraft during the Winter War, but few of those had reached service during the short conflict. Politics had also played a role, since Hitler did not wish to antagonize the Soviet Union by allowing aircraft exports through German-controlled territory during the Winter War. In addition to Fokker fighters and Bristol Blenheim bombers built under license, new aircraft types were in place by the time hostilities with Soviet Union resumed in 1941. Small numbers of Hawker Hurricanes arrived from the United Kingdom, Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s from France, Fiat G.50s from Italy, and one liaison aircraft. Numerous Brewster F2A Buffaloes from the neutral USA strengthened the FAF. A few dozen Curtiss Hawk 75s captured by the Germans in France and Norway were sold to Finland when Germany began warming up its ties with Finland. Finns reconditioned captured Tupolev SBs, Ilyushin DB-3s, and Polikarpov I-153s for service.

The FAF proved capable of holding its own in the upcoming battles with the Red Air Force. Older models, such as the Fokker D.XXI and Gloster Gladiator, had been replaced with new aircraft in front-line combat units.

The FAF&#x27;s main mission was to achieve air superiority over Finnish-held territory and to prevent Soviet air power from reinforcing the Red Army&#x27;s front lines. The fighter squadrons proved very successful in the Finnish offensive of 1941. A stripped-down, more manoeuvrable, and significantly lightened version of the American Brewster Buffalo was the FAF&#x27;s main fighter until 1943. Results with this fighter were very good, even though the type was considered to be a failure in the US Navy and with British and Dutch Far East forces. In Finnish use, the Brewster had a victory rate of 32:1 – 459 kills to 15 losses. German Bf 109s replaced the Brewster as the primary front-line fighter of the FAF in 1943, though the Buffalos continued in secondary roles until the end of the fighting. Other types, including the Italian Fiat G.50 and Curtiss Hawk 75, also proved capable in the hands of well-trained Finnish pilots. The principle reconnaissance type was the German Arado Ar 196, which had been purchased in 1943 and continued to serve throughout the war, though by mid-1944 the planes&#x27; pre-war roots were showing and were subsequently modified to a later A-5 model in an attempt to stave off obsolescence. Various Russian designs also saw action when lightly damaged &quot;kills&quot; were repaired and made airworthy.

Dornier Do 17s (received as a gift from Hermann Göring in 1942) and Junkers Ju 88s improved the bombing capability of the Finnish Air Force. The bomber force was also strengthened with a number of captured Soviet bombers, which had been taken in large numbers by the Wehrmacht during Operation Barbarossa. The bomber units flew assorted missions with varying results, but a large part of their time was spent in training, waiting until the time came to use the aircraft. Thus the bomber squadrons of Flying Regiment 4 were ready for the summer battles of 1944, which included for example the Battle of Tali-Ihantala (June to July 1944).

While the FAF was successful in its mission, conditions were not easy. Spare parts for the FAF planes were scarce — parts from the US (Buffalo and Hawk), Britain (Hurricanes), and Italy (G.50) were unavailable for much of the war. Repairs took often a long time, and the State Aircraft Factory was burdened with restoration/repair of captured Soviet planes and of foreign aircraft with many hours of flight time, and with the development of indigenous Finnish fighter types. Also, one damaged bomber took up workshop space equalling three fighters.

Finland was required to expel or intern remaining German forces as part of its peace agreement with the Soviets in September 1944. As a result, the Finns&#x27; fought their final air battles against retreating Luftwaffe units.

The Finnish Air Force did not bomb any civilian targets during either war. Overflying Soviet towns and bases was also forbidden, as to avoid any unneeded provocations and to spare equipment.

The Finnish Air Force shot down 1,621 Soviet aircraft while losing 210 of its own aircraft during the Continuation War.

===After World War II===
:&quot;See also The Finnish Air Force 1944–60&quot;
The end of World War II in 1945 and the Paris peace talks of 1947 brought about some limitations imposed on the FAF. For example, the Finnish Air Force could have:

* no more than 60 combat aircraft
* no aircraft with internal bomb bays
* no guided missiles or atomic weapons
* no weaponry of German construction or using German parts
* a maximum strength of 3,000 persons
* no offensive weapons

These revisions followed Soviet demands closely. When Britain, fearing that the provisions only augmented Soviet air defences, tried to vary some of the conditions, the Soviets opposed such proposals. The revisions were again revised in 1963, and Finland was allowed to buy guided missiles and a few bombers that were used as target-tugs. The FAF also used a loop-hole to strengthen its capabilities by purchasing large numbers of two-seater aircraft, which counted as trainer aircraft and were not included in the revisions. These aircraft could have secondary roles.

During the Cold War years ( to ), Finland tried to balance its purchases between east, west and domestic producers. This led to a diverse inventory of Soviet, British, Swedish, French and Finnish aircraft. After leading Finnish politicians held unofficial talks with their Swedish counterparts, Sweden began storing surplus Saab 35 Drakens, intended for transfer to Finland in the event of a war against the Soviet Union. This practice continued until the 1980s.

On 22 September 1990, a week before the unification of Germany, Finland declared that the limiting treaties were no longer active and that all the provisions of the Paris Peace Treaties were nullified.

In the 1990s, with the Cold War over, the Finnish Air Force ended its policy of purchasing Soviet/Russian aircraft and replaced the Saab Draken and MiG-21s in its fighter wing with US F/A-18C/D Hornets.

 the FAF is organized into three Air Commands, each assigned to one of Finland&#x27;s three air-defence areas. The main Wing bases are at Rovaniemi, Tampere and Kuopio-Rissala, each with a front-line squadron. Pilot training takes place at the Air Force Academy in Tikkakoski, with advanced conversion performed at squadron level.

In 2023 the English name for the Air Commands was changed to Air Wing.

==HX Fighter Program==

The current Hornet fleet is set to begin being phased out from 2025, and to be completely decommissioned by 2030. The Finnish MoD initiated its Hornet replacement programme in June 2015, and named it the &quot;HX Fighter Program&quot;. A working group was created and it identified suitable aircraft.

The final decision for choosing the new Air Force jet is based on five key considerations, which are the multi-role fighter&#x27;s military capability, security of supply, industrial cooperation solutions, procurement and life cycle costs, and security and defence policy implications. An extensive questionnaire had been sent out the producers asking what their products can offer Finland in form of capabilities, cost, security of supply and the domestic industry&#x27;s role, as well as security and defence policy impacts.

The goal is to retain the numerical strength of the FAF fighter fleet, which means that the goal is to obtain some 64 aircraft. The MoD has estimated that the programme will cost somewhere between 7–10 billion Euros. In October 2019, the government of Finland stipulated a budget ceiling of for the HX fighter programme.

In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent a letter to Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the fighter project had been launched in the Defence Forces. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. Responses were received from all five participants in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation was sent in the spring of 2018. The goal is to start the fighter candidates’ environmental testing in Finland in 2019. The buying decision took place in 2021.

On 10 December 2021, it was announced that Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II was the winner of the HX program. It was also revealed that neither the Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen nor the Eurofighter Typhoon had gone through to the final round.

The cost for 64 aircraft was , and the initial weapons package () and other associated costs (service equipment, reserve and replacement parts, training equipment and other systems and services were ) bringing the package to . Additionally are going to be used to upgrade facilities, and are saved for later expenses, such as air-to-ground weapons, resulting in total expenses of , below the limit of . Costs per aircraft frame is .

The aircraft are planned to be delivered between 2026 and 2030, and is expected to replace the F/A-18s during the period 2028–2030. The F-35s are intended to be in service until the 2070s. The FAF expects the annual operating costs not to exceed , which are the current operating costs for the F/A-18 fleet. The first weapons package will include AIM-9X Block II+ Sidewinder and AIM-120C-8 AMRAAM missiles, and later on air-to-ground weaponry will be obtained when they reach sufficient maturity and will match their shelf life with the introduction of the aircraft. The air-to-ground package might consist of GBU-53/B SDB II bombs, GBU-31 JDAM bombs, JSM and AGM-158B-2 JASSM-ER missiles, which all were offered in the deal. The DSCA notification also mentioned BLU-117, BLU-111 and BLU-109 bombs, as well as AGM-154C-1 Joint Stand Off Weapons (although the latter is unlikely as production ended in 2023).

<text>Idris (, Muhammad Idris bin Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi; 13 March 1890 – 25 May 1983) was King of Libya from 24 December 1951 until his ouster in the 1 September 1969 coup d&#x27;état. He ruled over the United Kingdom of Libya from 1951 to 1963, after which the country became known as simply the Kingdom of Libya. Idris had served as Emir of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania from the 1920s until 1951. He was the chief of the Muslim Senussi Order.

Idris was born into the Senussi Order. When his cousin Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi abdicated as leader of the Order, Idris took his position. The Senussi campaign was taking place, with the British and Italians fighting the Order. Idris put an end to the hostilities and, through the Modus vivendi of Acroma, abandoned Ottoman protection. Between 1919 and 1920, Italy recognized Senussi control over most of Cyrenaica in exchange for the recognition of Italian sovereignty by Idris. Idris then led his Order in an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the eastern part of the Tripolitanian Republic.

Following the Second World War, the United Nations General Assembly called for Libya to be granted independence. It established the United Kingdom of Libya through the unification of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan, appointing Idris to rule it as king. Wielding significant political influence in the impoverished country, Idris banned political parties and, in 1963, replaced Libya&#x27;s federal system with a unitary state. He established links to the Western powers, allowing the United Kingdom and United States to open military bases in the country in return for economic aid. After oil was discovered in Libya in 1959, he oversaw the emergence of a growing oil industry that rapidly aided economic growth. Idris&#x27;s regime was weakened by growing Arab nationalist and Arab socialist sentiment in Libya as well as rising frustration at the country&#x27;s high levels of corruption and close links with Western nations. While in Turkey for medical treatment, Idris was deposed in a 1969 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by army officers led by Muammar Gaddafi.

==Early life==
Idris was born at Al-Jaghbub, the headquarters of the Senussi movement, on 12 March 1889 (although some sources give the year as 1890), a son of Sayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi bin Sayyid Muhammad al-Senussi and his third wife Aisha bint Muqarrib al-Barasa. He was a grandson of Sayyid Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi, the founder of the Senussi Muslim Sufi Order and the Senussi tribe in North Africa. Idris&#x27;s family claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fatimah. The Senussi were a revivalist Sunni Islamic sect who were based largely in Cyrenaica, a region in present-day eastern Libya. The Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent his aide-de-camp Azmzade Sadik El Mueyyed to Jaghbub in 1886 and to Kufra in 1895 to cultivate positive relations with the Senussi and to counter the West European scramble for Africa. By the end of the nineteenth century the Senussi Order had established a government in Cyrenaica, unifying its tribes, controlling its pilgrimage and trade routes, and collecting taxes.

In 1916, Idris became chief of the Senussi order, following the abdication of his cousin Sayyid Ahmed Sharif es Senussi. He was recognized by the British under the new title &quot;emir&quot; of the territory of Cyrenaica, a position also confirmed by the Italians in 1920. He was also installed as Emir of Tripolitania on 28 July 1922.

==Head of the Senussi Order: 1916–22==

After the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (the Italian Royal Army) invaded Cyrenaica in 1913 as part of their wider invasion of Libya, the Senussi Order fought back against them. When the Order&#x27;s leader, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, abdicated his position, he was replaced by Idris, who was his cousin. Pressured to do so by the Ottoman Empire, Ahmed had pursued armed attacks against British military forces stationed in the neighbouring Sultanate of Egypt (formerly known, until December 1914, as the Khedivate of Egypt). On taking power, Idris put a stop to these attacks.
 Instead he established a tacit alliance with the British Empire, which would last for half a century and accord his Order &quot;de facto&quot; diplomatic status. Using the British as intermediaries, Idris led the Order into negotiations with the Italians in July 1916. These resulted in two agreements, at al-Zuwaytina in April 1916 and at Akrama in April 1917. The latter of these treaties left most of inland Cyrenaica under the control of the Senussi Order.
 Relations between the Senussi Order and the newly established Tripolitanian Republic were acrimonious. The Senussi attempted to militarily extend their power into eastern Tripolitania, resulting in a pitched battle at Bani Walid in which the Senussi were forced to withdraw back into Cyrenaica.

At the end of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire ceded their claims over Libya to the Kingdom of Italy. Italy, however, was facing serious economic, social, and political problems domestically, and was not prepared to re-launch its military activities in Libya. It issued statutes known as the &quot;Legge Fondamentale&quot;, for the Tripolitanian Republic in June 1919 and Cyrenaica in October 1919. These were a compromise by which all Libyans were accorded the right to joint Libyan-Italian citizenship, while each province was to have its own parliament and governing council. The Senussi were largely happy with this arrangement and Idris visited Rome as part of the celebrations to mark the promulgation of the settlement. In October 1920, further negotiations between Italy and Cyrenaica resulted in the Accord of al-Rajma, in which Idris was given the title of Emir of Cyrenaica and permitted to administer autonomously the oases around Kufra, Jalu, Jaghbub, Awjila, and Ajdabiya. As part of the Accord he was given a monthly stipend by the Italian government, who agreed to take responsibility for policing and administration of areas under Senussi control. The Accord also stipulated that Idris must fulfill the requirements of the &quot;Legge Fondamentale&quot; by disbanding the Cyrenaican military units, but he did not comply with this. By the end of 1921, relations between the Senussi Order and the Italian government had again deteriorated.

Following the death of Tripolitanian leader Ramadan Asswehly in August 1920, the Republic descended into civil war. Many tribal leaders in the region recognized that this discord was weakening the region&#x27;s chances of attaining full autonomy from Italy, and, in November 1920, they met in Gharyan to bring an end to the violence. In January 1922, they agreed to request that Idris extend the Emirate of Cyrenaica into Tripolitania in order to bring stability; they presented a formal document with this request on 28 July 1922. Idris&#x27;s advisers were divided on whether he should accept the offer or not. Doing so would contravene the al-Rajma Agreement and would damage relations with the Italian government, who opposed the political unification of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania as being against their interests. Nevertheless, in November 1922, Idris agreed to the proposal.

==Exile: 1922–1951==

Following the agreement, Emir Idris feared that Italy—under its new Fascist leader Benito Mussolini—would militarily retaliate against the Senussi Order, and so he went into exile in the newly established Kingdom of Egypt (formerly known as the Sultanate of Egypt) in December 1922. Soon, the Italian reconquest of Libya began, and, by the end of 1922, the only effective anti-colonial resistance to the occupation was concentrated in the Cyrenaican hinterlands. The Italians subjugated the Libyan people; Cyrenaica&#x27;s livestock was decimated, a large portion of its population was interned in concentration camps, and, in 1930 and 1931, an estimated 12,000 Cyrenaicans were executed by the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Italian Royal Army). The Italian government implemented a policy of &quot;demographic colonization&quot;, by which tens of thousands of Italians were relocated to Libya, largely to establish farms.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Idris supported the United Kingdom—which was now at war with Italy—in the hope of ridding his country of Italian occupation. He argued that even if the Italians were victorious, the situation for the Libyan people would be no different than it had been before the war. Delegates from both the Cyrenaicans and Tripolitanians agreed that Idris should conclude agreements with the British that they would gain independence in return for support during the war. Privately, Idris did not promote the idea of Libyan independence to the British, instead suggesting that it become a British protectorate akin to Transjordan. A Libyan Arab Force, consisting of five infantry battalions made up of volunteers, was established to aid the British war effort. With the exception of one military engagement near to Benghazi, this force&#x27;s role did not extend beyond support and gendarmerie duties.

After the defeat of the Italian armies, Libya was left under the military control of British and French forces. They governed the area until 1949 according to the Hague Convention of 1907. In 1946, a National Congress was established to lay the groundwork for independence; it was dominated by the Senussi Order. Under British and French pressure, Italy relinquished its claim of sovereignty over the country in 1947, although still hoping that they would be permitted a trusteeship over Tripolitania. The European powers drew up the Bevin-Sforza plan, which proposed that France retain a ten-year trusteeship in Fezzan, the UK in Cyrenaica, and Italy in Tripolitania. After the plans were published in May 1949, they generated violent demonstrations in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica and drew protests from the United States, Soviet Union, and other Arab states. In September 1948, the question of Libya&#x27;s future was brought to the United Nations General Assembly, which rejected the principles of the Bevin-Sforza plan, instead indicating support for full independence. At the time neither the UK nor France supported the principle of Libyan unification, with France being keen to retain colonial control of Fezzan. In 1949, the British unilaterally declared that they would leave Cyrenaica and grant it independence under the control of Idris; by doing so they believed that it would remain under their own sphere of influence. Similarly, France established a provisional government in Fezzan in February 1950.

In November 1949, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on Libyan independence, stipulating that it must come into being by January 1952. The resolution called for Libya to become a single state led by Idris, who was to be declared king of Libya. He had been reluctant to accept the position. Both the United Kingdom and the United States—who were committed to preventing any growth in Soviet influence in the southern Mediterranean—agreed to this for their own Cold War strategic reasons. They recognised that while they would be able to establish military bases in an independent Libyan state sympathetic to their interests, they would have been unable to do so were Libya to have entered UN-sponsored trusteeship. The Tripolitanians—largely united under Selim Muntasser and the United National Front—agreed to this plan in order to avoid further European colonial rule. The concept of a kingdom would be alien to Libyan society, where the loyalties to the family, tribe, and region—or alternately to the global Muslim community—were far stronger than to any concept of Libyan nationhood.

==King of Libya: 1951–1969==

On 24 December 1951, Idris announced the establishment of the United Kingdom of Libya from the al-Manar Palace in Benghazi. The country had a population of approximately one million, the majority of whom were Arabs, but with Berber, Tebu, Sephardi Jewish, Greek, Turkish, and Italian minorities. The newly established state faced serious problems; in 1951, Libya was one of the world&#x27;s poorest countries. Much of its infrastructure had been destroyed by war, it had very little trade and high unemployment, and both a 40% infant mortality rate and a 94% illiteracy rate. Only 1% of Libya&#x27;s land mass was arable, with another 3–4% being used for pastoral farming. Although the three provinces had been united, they shared little common aspiration.

The Kingdom was established along federal lines, something that Cyrenaica and Fezzan had insisted upon, fearing that they would otherwise be dominated by Tripolitania, where two-thirds of the Libyan population lived. Conversely, the Tripolitanians had largely favoured a unitary state, believing that it would allow the government to act more effectively in the national interest and fearing that a federal system would result in further British and French domination of Libya. The three provinces had their own legislative authorities; while that of Fezzan was composed entirely of elected officials, those of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania contained a mix of elected and non-elected representatives. This constitutional framework left Libya with a weak central government and strong provincial autonomy. The governments of successive Prime Ministers tried to push through economic policies but found them hampered by the differing provinces. There remained a persistent distrust between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania. Benghazi and Tripoli were appointed as joint capital cities, with the country&#x27;s parliament moving between the two. The city of Bayda also became a &quot;de facto&quot; summer capital as Idris moved there.

According to the reporter Jonathan Bearman, King Idris was &quot;nominally a constitutional monarch&quot; but in practice was &quot;a spiritual leader with autocratic temporal power&quot;, with Libya being a &quot;monarchical dictatorship&quot; rather than a constitutional monarchy or parliamentary democracy. The new constitution granted Idris significant personal power, and he remained a crucial player in the country&#x27;s political system. Idris ruled via a palace cabinet, namely his royal &quot;diwan&quot;, which contained a &quot;chef de cabinet&quot;, two deputies, and senior advisers. This &quot;diwan&quot; worked in consultation with the federal government to determine the policies of the Libyan state.

King Idris was a self-effacing devout Muslim; he refused to allow his portrait to be featured on Libyan currency and also insisted that nothing should be named after him except the Tripoli Idris Airport. Idris&#x27;s regime soon banned political parties from operating in the country, claiming that they exacerbated internal instability. From 1952 onward, all candidates for election were government nominees. In 1954, the Prime Minister Mustafa Ben Halim suggested that Libya be converted from a federal to a unitary system and that Idris be proclaimed President for Life. Idris recognised that this would deal with the problems caused by federalism and would put a stop to the intrigues among the Senussi family surrounding his succession. He asked Ben Halim to produce a formal draft for these plans, but the idea was dropped amid opposition from Cyrenaican tribal chiefs.

Under King Idris, Libya found itself within the Western sphere of influence. It became the recipient of Western expertise and aid, and, by the end of 1959, it had received over $100 million of aid from the United States, being the single largest per capita recipient of American aid. U.S. companies would also play a leading role in the development of the Libyan oil industry. This support was provided on a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; basis, and in return Libya granted the United States and United Kingdom usage of the Wheelus Air Base and the al-Adem Air Base. This reliance on the Western nations placed Libya at odds with the growing Arab nationalist and Arab socialist sentiment across the Arab world. The Arab nationalist sentiment promoted by &quot;Radio Cairo&quot; found a particularly receptive audience in Tripolitania. In July 1967, anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi to protest the West&#x27;s support of Israel against the Arab states in the Six-Day War. Many oil workers across Libya went on strike in solidarity with the Arab forces fighting Israel.

During the 1950s, a number of foreign companies began prospecting for oil in Libya, with the country&#x27;s government passing the Minerals Law of 1953 and then the Petroleum Law of 1955 to regulate this process. In 1959, much larger oil reserves were discovered in Libya, which helped Idris transform the nation into one of the richest in the world. The 1955 law created conditions that enabled small oil companies to drill alongside larger corporations; each concession had a low entry fee, with rents only increasing significantly after the eighth year of drilling. This created a competitive atmosphere that prevented any one company from becoming crucial to the country&#x27;s oil operation, although it had the downside of incentivising companies to produce as much oil as possible in as quick a period as possible. Libya&#x27;s oil fields fuelled rapidly growing demand in Europe, and by 1967 it was supplying a third of the oil entering the West European market. Within a few years, Libya had grown to become the world&#x27;s fourth largest oil producer. Oil production provided a huge boost to the Libyan economy; whereas the per capita annual income in 1951 had been $25–35, by 1969 it was $2,000. By 1961, the oil industry was exerting the greater influence over Libyan politics than any other issue. In 1962, Libya joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In ensuing years, the Libyan state furthered its control over the industry, establishing a Ministry of Petroleum Affairs in 1963 and then the Libyan National Oil Company. In 1968, they established the Libyan Petroleum Company (LIPETCO) and announced that any further concession agreements would have to be joint ventures with LIPETCO.

Libya experienced rampant corruption and favouritism. A number of high-profile corruption scandals impacted on the highest levels of Idris&#x27;s government. In June 1960, Idris issued a public letter in which he condemned this corruption, claiming that bribery and nepotism &quot;will destroy the very existence of the state and its good reputation both at home and abroad&quot;.

On April 26, 1963, King Idris abolished Libya&#x27;s federal system. Both the provincial legislative assemblies and the provincial judicial systems were abolished. Doing so allowed him to concentrate economic and administrative planning at a centralised national level, and thenceforth all taxes and oil revenues were directed straight to the central government. As part of this reform, the &quot;United Kingdom of Libya&quot; was renamed the &quot;Kingdom of Libya&quot;. This reform was not popular among many of Libya&#x27;s provinces, which saw their power curtailed. According to the historian Dirk Vandewalle, this change was &quot;the single most critical political act during the monarchy&#x27;s tenure in office&quot;. The reform handed far greater political power to Idris than he had held previously. By the mid-1960s, Idris began to increasingly retreat from active involvement in the country&#x27;s governance.

In 1955, failing to have produced a male heir, he convinced Queen Fatimah, his wife of 20 years, to let him marry a second wife, Aliya Abdel Lamloun, daughter of a wealthy Bedouin chief. The second marriage took place on 5 June 1955. Both wives then became pregnant, and each bore him a son.

==Overthrow and exile==

On 1 September 1969, while King Idris was in Turkey for medical treatment, he was deposed in a coup d&#x27;état by a group of Libyan Army officers under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi. The monarchy was abolished and a republic proclaimed. The coup pre-empted King Idris&#x27;s intended abdication and the succession of his heir the following day. From Turkey, he and the Queen traveled to Kamena Vourla, Greece, by ship and went into exile in Egypt. After the 1969 coup, King Idris was put on trial &quot;in absentia&quot; in the Libyan People&#x27;s Court and sentenced to death in November 1971.

Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s regime portrayed King Idris&#x27;s administration as having been weak, inept, corrupt, anachronistic, and lacking in nationalist credentials, a presentation of it that would come to be widely adopted.

In 1983, at the age of 93, King Idris died in a hospital in the district of Dokki in Cairo. He was buried at Al-Baqi&#x27; Cemetery, Medina, Saudi Arabia.

==Legacy==

According to Vandewalle, King Idris&#x27;s monarchy &quot;started Libya on the road of political exclusion of its citizens, and of a profound de-politicization&quot; that still characterised the country in the first years of the 21st century. He informed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and an early academic researcher that he had not truly wanted to rule over a unified Libya.

Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s policies with regard to the oil industry would also be technocratic and bore many similarities with those of King Idris.

Although the King died in exile and most Libyans were born after his reign, during the Libyan Civil War, many demonstrators opposing Gaddafi carried portraits of the King, especially in Cyrenaica. The tricolour flag used during the era of the monarchy was frequently used as a symbol of the revolution and was re-adopted by the National Transitional Council as the official flag of Libya.

==Personal life==

Vandewalle characterised King Idris as &quot;a scholarly individual whose entire life would be marked by a reluctance to engage in politics&quot;. For Vandewalle, Idris was a &quot;well meaning but reluctant ruler&quot;, as well as &quot;a pious, deeply religious, and self-effacing man&quot;. The Libyan Prime Minister Ben Halim stated his view that &quot;I was sure... that [Idris] sincerely wanted reform, but I knew from experience that he became hesitant when he felt that such reform would affect the interests of his entourage. He would gradually pull back until he abandoned the reform plans, moved by the whisperings of his entourage.&quot;

King Idris married five times:

# At Kufra, 1896/1897, his cousin, Sayyida Aisha binti Sayyid Muhammad as-Sharif al-Sanussi (1873 Jaghbub – 1905 or 1907 Kufra), eldest daughter of Sayyid Muhammad as-Sharif bin Sayyid Muhammad al-Sanussi, by his fourth wife, Fatima, daughter of &#x27;Umar bin Muhammad al-Ashhab, of Fezzan, by whom he had one son who died in infancy;
# At Kufra, 1907 (divorced 1922), his cousin, Sakina, daughter of Muhammad as-Sharif, by whom he had one son and one daughter, both of whom died in infancy;
# At Kufra, 1911 (divorced 1915), Nafisa, daughter of Ahmad Abu al-Qasim al-Isawi, by whom he had one son who died in infancy;
# At Siwa, Egypt, 1931, his cousin, Sayyida Fatima al-Shi&#x27;fa binti Sayyid Ahmad as-Sharif al-Sanussi, Fatimah el-Sharif (1911 Kufra – 3 October 2009, Cairo, buried in Jannat al-Baqi, Medina, Saudi Arabia), fifth daughter of Field Marshal Sayyid Ahmad as-Sharif Pasha bin Sayyid Muhammad as-Sharif al-Senussi, 3rd Grand Seussi, by his second wife, Khadija, daughter of Ahmad al-Rifi, by whom he had one son, who died in infancy;

<doc id="317443" wikidata="Q273626" url="?curid=317443" title="École polytechnique">
<text> (, ; also known as Polytechnique or l&#x27;X ) is a &quot;grande école&quot; located in Palaiseau, France. It specializes in science and engineering and is a founding member of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris.

The school was founded in 1794 by mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution and was militarized under Napoleon I in 1804. It is still supervised by the French Ministry of Armed Forces. Originally located in the Latin Quarter in central Paris, the institution moved to Palaiseau in 1976, in the Paris-Saclay technology cluster.

French engineering students undergo initial military training and have the status of paid officer cadets. The school has also been awarding doctorates since 1985, masters since 2005 and bachelors since 2017. Most Polytechnique engineering graduates go on to become top executives in companies, senior civil servants, military officers, or researchers.

Its alumni from the engineering graduate program include three Nobel Prize winners, a Fields Medalist, three Presidents of France and many CEOs of French and international companies. The school has produced renowned mathematicians such as Cauchy, Coriolis, Henri Poincaré, Laurent Schwartz and Benoît Mandelbrot, physicists such as Becquerel, Carnot, Ampère and Fresnel, and economists Maurice Allais and Jean Tirole. French Marshals Joffre, Foch, Fayolle and Maunoury were also notable Polytechnique engineering graduates.

== Name ==

Founded in 1794 as the (Central School of Public Works), the school initially provided teaching limited to technical knowledge. In 1795, the school was renamed the &quot;&quot; (Polytechnic School). The neologism , appearing for the first time in a document published by Claude Prieur at the beginning of 1795, means &quot;many arts&quot;, referring to the plurality of applied arts, sciences, technology, engineering and other academic subjects taught at the school.

Under the Restoration and the July Monarchy, the school was officially renamed the &quot;École royale polytechnique&quot;. Under the First and the Second Empire, it was renamed the &quot;École impériale polytechnique&quot;. The students, alumni, and graduates were called &quot;Polytechnicians&quot;. The school was often simply called &quot;Polytechnique&quot;.

The school has been nicknamed &quot;l&#x27;X&quot; or the &quot;X&quot; since the middle of the 19th century. Two explanations have been put forward. One points to the two crossed cannons on the school&#x27;s badge. The other attributes it to the preeminence of mathematics in the training of Polytechnicians. According to &quot;L&#x27;Argot de l&#x27;X&quot;, published in 1894: &quot;It is from the very importance given to the teaching of &quot;ana&quot; analysis], the whole language of which is made up of x and y, that the nickname X came, universally accepted to designate Polytechnicians. Not all of them are mathematicians, but all have sufficient knowledge of differential and integral calculus for public service applications. Let us further say that in troubled times, such as 1830 and 1848, this knowledge particularly helped them to avoid being confused with all the individuals who disguised themselves as Polytechnicians to give themselves the appearance of defenders of order. When they were encountered, they were asked the differential of sin x or log x, and if they did not answer, they were immediately locked up.&quot; However, in the 1994 edition, the origin of the nickname was again reported to be the crossing of the canons on the coat of arms. The nickname &quot;X&quot; also applies to Polytechnicians. Female Polytechnicians are sometimes nicknamed &quot;Xettes&quot; or &quot;X7&quot;, which is pronounced .

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the school and its students and alumni were nicknamed &quot;pipo&quot;. In the early 20th century, the school was also nicknamed &quot;Carva&quot;.

== History ==


=== Foundation and early years ===
After the Revolution of 1789, the royal engineering schools were closed. The First Republic faced a shortage of engineers and military officers. Jacques-Élie Lamblardie, Gaspard Monge and Lazare Carnot, the founding fathers of the School, were charged with organizing a new &quot;&quot; (Central School of Public Works) which was officially created on 7 Vendémiaire, Year III (September 28, 1794) and opened to students on 1 Nivôse, Year III (December 21, 1794)., The aim of the school was to train civil and military engineers. The school quickly welcomed 400 students of different levels. During the first three months, &quot;revolutionary courses&quot; were given in physics, mathematics and chemistry, after which they took exams to see if they could enter the civil service directly, or if they should continue their studies. The school was renamed the &quot;&quot; a year later. The change of name reflects the change of vocation of the school, which now prepares students for other specialized schools such as the École du génie, the École des mines and the École des ponts et chaussées. The curriculum lasted 3 years, the &quot;regular courses&quot; replaced the &quot;revolutionary courses&quot; and there were only 120 new students each year. The school was placed under the supervision of the Ministries of War and the Interior., A &quot;Journal Polytechnique&quot; (former name of &quot;Journal de l&#x27;École polytechnique&quot; ) was created in 1795. In 1799, the course was reduced from three to two years.

In 1805, Emperor Napoléon I transferred the school to Montagne Sainte-Geneviève in the of central Paris to become a military academy and gave it its motto: (For the Nation, Science, and Glory). In 1804, after the militarization of the school, its atmosphere changed significantly from a rather free spirit to a meticulous bureaucracy. Militarization was motivated by Napoleon&#x27;s favorable opinion of Polytechnicians who had contributed to the Egyptian expedition and by his admiration for Monge and Laplace. Militarization was accompanied by a specialization of teaching towards mathematics.

In 1814, students participated in the fighting to defend Paris against the Sixth Coalition. After the restoration of 1816, the number of students was reduced to about seventy-five and the &#x27;military arts&#x27; course was abolished. In 1817, King Louis XVIII demilitarized the and placed it under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior. In 1830, fifty students participated in the July Revolution. Various decrees were issued until 1832. Above all, the school came under the administration of the Ministry of War, thus regaining its military status. The republican ideal prevailed at the school, as shown by the active participation of students in the revolutions of 1830 and 1848.

=== The French Second Empire ===
Because of the tension between revolutionary ideas and the service of the state, the republican ideal gradually disappeared after 1851. Polytechnicians even found themselves on the side of the Versaillese when the Paris Commune was crushed in 1871. During the years 1871–1872, the number of students admitted per year doubled from 140 to 280. The Polytechnicians sought above all to strengthen their position in the spheres of power to compensate for their loss of influence in the technical field. While they could have turned to an engineering profession associated with industry, the Polytechnicians instead reinforced their sovereign vocation by joining the &quot;state nobility&quot; of the Second French Empire, whose origins, interests and convictions they gradually shared. The years 1860–1870 marked an important evolution since the school became more of a &quot;conservatory of sciences&quot; than a center of research and innovation, while extending its hold on the management of the industrial apparatus.

=== The World Wars ===
During World War I, the students were mobilized and the school building was transformed into a hospital. No national entrance exam was held in 1915. More than eight hundred students died during the war. In 1921, students of foreign nationalities were allowed to take the entrance exam for the first time. During the Second World War, the was transferred to Lyon in the free zone, lost its military status, and its Parisian buildings were given to the Red Cross. More than four hundred students died during the war (Free French, French Resistance, Nazi camps).

=== From post-war to today ===
In 1944, the School was again placed under the administration of the Ministry of War. In 1970, the School became a state-sponsored civilian institution under the auspices of the Ministry of Defence. The first female students were admitted in 1972. One woman, Anne Chopinet, was class valedictorian. In 1976, the School moved from the center of Paris to Palaiseau, in the southern suburbs. In 1985, it began awarding doctoral degrees. In 1994, the bicentennial celebration was presided over by President François Mitterrand. In 1995, a new entrance exam was set up for international students and in 2000, the &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; program was extended from 3 to 4 years.

== Locations ==

===Early locations===
In 1794, was first housed in the Palais Bourbon. A year later, it moved to the Hôtel de Lassay, a in the 7th arrondissement of Paris.

===Montagne Saint-Geneviève (1805–1976)===
In 1805, when he placed the School under military administration, Napoleon transferred it to the , in the former premises of the colleges of Navarre, Tournai and Boncourt, now the Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The Paris campus was located near the Panthéon, at 5 rue Descartes, and was nicknamed &quot;Carva&quot; by the students.

=== Palaiseau (from 1976) ===
Located in the suburbs of Paris, about from the city center, École polytechnique is a campus-based institution. It offers teaching facilities, student housing, dining and hospitality services, and a range of sports facilities dedicated to the 4,600 people who live on campus.

The nearest regional train station is Lozère (line B, zone 4 of the RER network). Several buses also connect École polytechnique to the Massy-Palaiseau RER station and Massy TGV station.

The campus is close to other scientific institutions in Saclay (Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives), Orsay (Université Paris-Sud) and Bures (Institut des hautes études scientifiques and some laboratories of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique).

==Organization and administration==

===Specific status===

École polytechnique is an institution of higher education under the supervision of the French Ministry of Defence, through the General Directorate for Armament (administratively speaking, it is a national public establishment of an administrative character). It has a dual status, being an engineering school that trains civilian engineers and scientists, but also officers for the three French armies. The aim is to provide the French state with a scientific and technical elite. The number of graduates becoming civil servants and officers has weakened since 1950: today, only 10 to 20% of the school&#x27;s students join the ranks of the administration or the army, while 20% go into research and the rest into engineering or management.

The school is headed by a general officer (since 2012, by a Senior General Engineer of Armament, whereas previous directors had all been generals of the French Armed Forces), and employs military personnel in leadership, administrative, and sports training positions. French undergraduate Polytechnicians, both male and female, are cadets and have to go through a period of military training before beginning their studies. However, the military dimension of the school faded over time, with a reduced period of preliminary military training, and fewer students choosing a career as an officer.

Since the abolition of the &#x27;internal uniform&#x27; in the mid-1980s, students no longer wear uniforms on campus. On special occasions, such as the military parade on the Champs-Élysées on Bastille Day, conferences, ceremonies, and other events on campus, Polytechnicians wear the 19th-century-style &quot;Grand Uniforme&quot;, including a bicorne.

=== Activities and teaching staff ===
École polytechnique has a general engineering curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as a doctoral school. In addition to the faculty coming from its local laboratories, it employs many researchers and professors from other institutions, including laboratories such as CNRS, CEA, and INRIA, as well as from the École Normale Supérieure and nearby institutions such as the Institut d&#x27;Optique, and the Université Paris-Sud, thus creating a varied and high-level teaching environment.

Contrary to French public universities, the teachers at École polytechnique are not civil servants () but contract employees. In addition to full-time professors who conduct research and have full teaching duties, there are part-time professors who have only a partial teaching load. Part-time teachers are often recruited from research organizations (CNRS, CEA, INRIA, etc.) that carry out their activities on the school&#x27;s campus, in the Paris region, or sometimes even in the provinces.

== Academic programs ==
=== The &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; program ===
The &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; (&quot;Polytechnician Engineer&quot;) program awards the prestigious &quot;diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; degree, and is selective upon entry. The subjects covered often go beyond the student&#x27;s specialty, and the course is focused on generalized education allowing cross-fertilization between different fields.

In addition to 2,000 &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; students (500 students per year), the institution has approximately 439 master&#x27;s students and 572 doctoral students, for a total of 2,900 enrolled.

==== Admission ====

There are two ways to enter the &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; program. The first way is through a very selective competitive examination that requires at least two years of intensive preparation after high school in &quot;classes préparatoires&quot;. The second way is to do undergraduate studies at another university. There is a week of written exams in the spring, followed by oral exams in the summer.

About 400 French students are admitted to the school each year. Foreign students who have completed a &quot;classe préparatoire&quot; can also enter through the same competitive examination. In total, there are about 100 foreign students admitted to this cycle each year. Foreign students from European or American universities can also be admitted as part of an exchange program for a semester or a year.

==== Curriculum ====
Four years of study are required for the engineering degree: one year of military service (for French nationals only) and a scientific &quot;common curriculum&quot; (eight months and four months, respectively), one year of multidisciplinary studies, and one year of specialized studies (&quot;majors&quot;). Since the reform of the curriculum in 2000, students complete a fourth year of study in a partner institution.
;First year
The curriculum begins with eight months of mandatory military service for students of French nationality. In the past, this service lasted 12 months and was compulsory for all French students; the abolition of draft in France made this requirement of Polytechnique somewhat anachronistic, and the service was reformulated as a period of &quot;human and military training.&quot; All French students spend a month together at La Courtine in a military training center. By the end of this month, they are assigned either to a civilian service or to the Army, Navy, Air Force or Gendarmerie. Students who are assigned to military service undergo two months of military training at French officer schools such as Saint-Cyr or École Navale. Finally, they are assigned to a wide range of units for a five-month tour of duty in a French military unit (which may include, but is not limited to, infantry and artillery regiments, warships, and air bases).

While French students remain under military status during their studies at Polytechnique, and participate in various ceremonies and other military events, such as national ceremonies like Bastille Day or the anniversaries of the armistices of the World Wars, they do not undergo actual military training after completing their first-year service. They receive at the end of the first year the full dress uniform, which comprises black trousers with a red stripe (a skirt for females), a coat with brass buttons and a belt, a small sword and a cocked hat (officially called a &quot;bicorne&quot;). French-speaking foreign students perform civil service. Civil service can, for example, consist of being an assistant in a high school in a disadvantaged French suburb.

Then begins a four-month period during which all students take the same five courses: Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and Economics.
;Second year
The second year is a year of multidisciplinary studies. The set of disciplines covers most of the scientific fields (mathematics, applied mathematics, mechanics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, economics) and some areas of the humanities (foreign languages, general humanities...). Students must choose twelve courses in at least five different disciplines.

;Third year
In the third year, students must choose a specialization (&quot;programme d&#x27;approfondissement&quot;), which often focuses on a discipline or sometimes an interdisciplinary subject. This year ends with a research internship (four to six months). Students also earn a Master&#x27;s degree in engineering, science and technology in their third year.

;Fourth year
The fourth year is the beginning of more specialized studies: students who do not enter a State Corps must enter either a Master&#x27;s degree or a doctorate, a partner college or institute such as the École des mines de Paris or ENSAE, or a specialization institute such as Supaéro in Toulouse or ENSPM in Rueil-Malmaison. The reason for this is that the generic education provided at Polytechnique is more focused on developing thinking skills than on preparing students for the transition to a real engineering career, which requires more advanced technical training.

==== Class rank and career path ====
The grades of the second year of the curriculum are used to rank the students. Traditionally, this individual exit ranking was very important for the French students of the École polytechnique, and certain peculiarities in the organization of studies and ranking can be attributed to the need for equity among students.

For French nationals, this ranking is part of a government recruitment program: a certain number of places in civil or military Corps, including elite civil servant such as the Corps des Mines or Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests, are open to students each year. These specific corps of civil servants, which provide the senior executives of the public administration, are open only to students of the École polytechnique and to rare students of the Ecole Normale Supérieure. At some point in their studies, students make a list of the corps they wish to enter in order of preference, and they are enrolled in the highest corps according to their ranking. The next step for French Polytechnicians is to join one of the four technical schools of the civil service: École des mines, École des ponts et chaussées, Télécom ParisTech, ENSTA Paris or ENSAE, thus joining one of the civil service bodies known as &quot;grands corps techniques de l&#x27;État&quot;. Those who follow this path are called as X-Mines, X-Ponts, X-Télécoms and X-INSEE respectively.

Since the X2000 reform, the importance of rank has diminished. With the exception of the corps curriculum, the universities and schools where Polytechnicians complete their training now base their acceptance decisions on the transcripts of all grades.

Of the 47% of graduates who decide to pursue a professional career in the private sector, the majority (58%) are based in the Greater Paris area, 8% in the rest of France, while 34% are based outside France. Only 12% of the cohort work under a non-French employment contract. École polytechnique students earn an average of €44,000 per year after graduation.

==== Tuition and financial obligations ====
French students admitted to the École polytechnique do not pay tuition fees and receive a salary as officer cadets. Through the student board, they redistribute part of this sum to foreign students.

There is no particular financial obligation for students who complete the program and then enter an application school or graduate program accredited by the École polytechnique.

=== Bachelor program ===

The Bachelor is a three-year program fully taught in English which opened in 2017. Either French nationals or international students are eligible. Applications are opened to final year high school students. Selection is made through an online application file and an oral interview. During the first year of the programme, students follow a pluridisciplinary curriculum based on mathematics.

=== Master&#x27;s program ===
École polytechnique offers various master&#x27;s programs, alone or in association with other schools and universities, on a wide variety of subjects that are more specialized than the &quot;Ingénieur polytechnicien&quot; program. The school offers programs in AI, computer vision, economics, finance, environmental science, energy, and data science. Some degrees in entrepreneurship are delivered in partnership with HEC Paris.

=== Doctoral program ===
The school also has a doctoral program open to students with a master&#x27;s degree or equivalent. Doctoral students generally work in the school&#x27;s laboratories; they may also work in external institutes or institutions that cannot or will not award a doctorate.

About 40% of doctoral students come from abroad.

=== Research centres ===
École polytechnique has many research laboratories operating in various scientific fields (physics, mathematics, computer science, economics, chemistry, biology, etc.), most operated in association with national scientific institutions such as CNRS, CEA, Inserm, and Inria.

== Student life ==
Students are represented by a board of 16 students known as &quot;la Kès&quot;, elected each November. La Kès manages the relationships with teachers, management, alumni and partners. It publishes a weekly students paper, &quot;InfoKès&quot;.

== Sports ==
Sports are an important part of student life, as all students are required to play 6 hours of sports per week. There are competitive and club sports ranging from skydiving and judo to circus and hiking. There are two swimming pools, dojo and fencing rooms, and an equestrian center on campus. The &quot;Jumping de l&#x27;X&quot; is an international show jumping competition organized by the school.

== Notable people ==
Many École polytechnique graduates hold important positions in government, industry and research in France. Its alumni include three Nobel prizes winners, three presidents of the French Republic, and several business and industry leaders. Researchers at the French National Centre for Scientific Research have found that most business executives in France are traditionally alumni of École polytechnique.

== Rankings ==

=== General rankings ===
In international rankings, École polytechnique is ranked as part of the Polytechnic Institute of Paris.

=== Research performance ===
In 2020, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked the university at 475th globally with its &quot;Engineering Subjects&quot; placed at 451–500th in the world. In 2020, it is ranked 509th in the world by the University Ranking by Academic Performance.

=== Other rankings ===
In the 2015 Times Higher Education Small Universities Rankings, École polytechnique ranks third, after Caltech and École normale supérieure (Paris).

The Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities, which looks at the education of the Fortune 500 CEOs, ranks École polytechnique seventh in the world in its 2011 ranking (1st being Harvard University), second among French institutions behind HEC Paris.

==Criticisms==

The French , including the École polytechnique, are criticized for their &quot;elitism&quot; and lack of diversity. INSEE has found that the children of executives and teachers are more likely to enter the &quot;écoles&quot; than children from lower-income families. A more recent report found that children of employees are 50 times more likely to enter the Ecole polytechnique than the children of workers.

<doc id="317445" wikidata="Q175763" url="?curid=317445" title="Tietze syndrome">
<text>Tietze syndrome is a benign inflammation of one or more of the costal cartilages. It was first described in 1921 by German surgeon Alexander Tietze and was subsequently named after him. The condition is characterized by tenderness and painful swelling of the anterior (front) chest wall at the costochondral (rib to cartilage), sternocostal (cartilage to sternum), or sternoclavicular (clavicle to sternum) junctions. Tietze syndrome affects the true ribs and has a predilection for the 2nd and 3rd ribs, commonly affecting only a single joint. 

In environments such as the emergency department, an estimated 20-50% of non-cardiac chest pain is due to a musculoskeletal cause. Despite musculoskeletal conditions such as Tietze syndrome being a common reason for visits to the emergency room, they are frequently misdiagnosed as angina pectoris, pleurisy, and other serious cardiopulmonary conditions due to similar presentation. Though Tietze syndrome can be misdiagnosed, life-threatening conditions with similar symptoms such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) should be ruled out prior to diagnosis of other conditions.

Tietze syndrome is often confused with costochondritis. Tietze syndrome is differentiated from costochondritis by swelling of the costal cartilages, which does not appear in costochondritis. Additionally, costochondritis affects the 2nd to 5th ribs while Tietze syndrome typically affects the 2nd or 3rd rib. 

==Presentation==
Tietze syndrome typically presents unilaterally at a single joint of the anterior chest wall, with 70% of patients having tenderness and swelling on only one side, usually at the 2nd or 3rd rib. Research has described the condition to be both sudden and gradual, varying by the individual. Pain and swelling from Tietze syndrome are typically chronic and intermittent and can last from a few days to several weeks.

The most common symptom of Tietze syndrome is pain, primarily in the chest, but can also radiate to the shoulder and arm. The pain has been described as aching, gripping, neuralgic, sharp, dull, and even described as &quot;gas pains&quot;. The symptoms of Tietze syndrome have been reported to be exacerbated by sneezing, coughing, deep inhalation, and overall physical exertion. Tenderness and swelling of the affected joint are important symptoms of Tietze syndrome and differentiate the condition from costochondritis. It has also been suggested that discomfort can be further aggravated due to restricted shoulder and chest movement.

==Cause==
The true etiology of Tietze syndrome has not been established, though several theories have been proposed. One popular theory is based on observations that many patients begin developing symptoms following a respiratory infection and dry cough, with one study finding 51 out of 65 patients contracted Tietze syndrome after either a cough or respiratory infection. Thus, it has been hypothesized that the repetitive mild trauma of a severe cough from a respiratory infection may produce small tears in the ligament called microtrauma, causing Tietze syndrome. However, this theory is disputed as it does not account for symptoms such as the onset of attacks while at rest as well as the fact that swelling sometimes develops before a cough. The respiratory infection has also been observed accompanying rheumatoid arthritis which, coupled with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, c-reactive protein (CRP), and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggest an infectious and rheumatoid factor, though the evidence is conflicting. Many theories such as malnutrition, chest trauma, and tuberculosis, were thought to be among the potential causes but have since been disproven or left unsupported.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis for Tietze syndrome is primarily a clinical one, though some studies suggest the use of radiologic imaging. Musculoskeletal conditions are estimated to account for 20-50% of non-cardiac related chest pain in the emergency department. Ruling out other conditions, especially potentially life-threatening ones such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and angina pectoris, is extremely important as they can present similarly to Tietze syndrome. These can usually be ruled out with diagnostic tools such as an electrocardiogram and a physical examination showing reproducible chest wall tenderness, . After eliminating other possible conditions, physical examination is considered the most accurate tool in diagnosing Tietze syndrome. Physical examination consists of gentle pressure to the chest wall with a single finger to identify the location of the discomfort. Swelling and tenderness upon palpation at one or more of the costochondral, sternocostal, or sternoclavicular joints, is a distinctive trait of Tietze syndrome and is considered a positive diagnosis when found.

There are some pathological features that can be observed with Tietze syndrome, including degeneration of the costal cartilage, increase in vascularity, and hypertrophic changes (enlarged cells). However, these features can only be identified from a biopsy. Some studies have begun exploring and defining the use of radiographic imaging for diagnosing Tietze syndrome. This includes computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bone scintigraphy, and ultrasound, though these are only case studies and the methods described have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Methods such as plain radiographs, better known as an x-ray, are helpful in the exclusion of other conditions, but not in the diagnosis of Tietze syndrome. Some researchers believe that ultrasound is superior to other available imaging methods, as it can visualize the increased volume, swelling, and structural changes of the costal cartilage. 

===Differential diagnosis===
The symptoms of Tietze syndrome can display as a wide variety of conditions, making it difficult to diagnose, especially to physicians unaware of the condition. Due to its presentation, Tietze syndrome can be misdiagnosed as a number of conditions, including myocardial infarction (heart attack), angina pectoris, and neoplasms.

Costochondritis is most commonly confused with Tietze syndrome, as they have similar symptoms and can both affect the costochondral and sternocostal joints. Costochondritis is considered a more common condition and is not associated with any swelling to the affected joints, which is the defining distinction between the two. Tietze syndrome commonly affects the 2nd or 3rd rib and typically occurs among a younger age group, while costochondritis affects the 2nd to 5th ribs and has been found to occur in older individuals, usually over the age of 40. In addition, ultrasound can diagnose Tietze syndrome, whereas costochondritis relies heavily on physical examination and medical history.

Another condition that can be confused for Tietze syndrome and costochondritis is slipping rib syndrome (SRS). All three conditions are associated with chest pain as well as inflammation of the costal cartilage. Unlike both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, which affect some of the true ribs (1st to 7th), SRS affects the false ribs (8th to 10th). SRS is characterized by the partial dislocation, or subluxation, of the joints between the costal cartilages. This causes inflammation, irritated intercostal nerves, and straining of the intercostal muscles. SRS can cause abdominal and back pain, which costochondritis does not. Tietze syndrome and SRS can both present with radiating pain to the shoulder and arm, and both conditions can be diagnosed with ultrasound, though SRS requires a more complex dynamic ultrasound.

The vast differential diagnosis also includes:
* Pleural diseases including pleurisy, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax.
* Rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and rheumatic fever.
* Arthritis of the costal cartilages, including rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis (pyogenic), monoarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis.
* Neoplasms, both benign and malignant (cancerous), including chondroma, osteochondroma, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and carcinoma.
* Nerve pain, specifically intercostal neuritis and intercostal neuropathy.
*Aortic dissection, a serious condition involving a tear in the body&#x27;s largest artery.

==Treatment==
Tietze syndrome is considered to be a self-limiting condition that usually resolves within a few months with rest. Management for Tietze syndrome usually consists of analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and naproxen. Other methods of management include manual therapy and local heat application. These are intended to relieve pain and are not expected to treat or cure Tietze syndrome as the condition is expected to resolve on its own.

=== Intercostal nerve block ===
A nerve block can be utilized in cases where symptom management is not satisfactory in relieving pain. This is usually a nerve-blocking injection that consists of a combination of steroids such as hydrocortisone, and anesthetics such as lidocaine and procaine, which is typically administered under ultrasound guidance. One study used a combination of triamcinolone hexacetonide and 2% lidocaine in 9 patients and after a week, found an average 82% decrease in size of the affected costal cartilage when assessing with ultrasound as well as a significant improvement of symptoms clinically. However, the long-term effectiveness of the injection is disputed, with multiple researchers describing recurrence of symptoms and repetitive injections.

=== Surgical intervention ===
In refractory cases of Tietze syndrome, where the condition is resistant to other conservative treatment options, surgery is considered. Surgery is uncommon for cases of Tietze syndrome, as many describe Tietze syndrome as manageable under less invasive options. The use of surgery in this context refers to the resection of the affected costal cartilages and some of the surrounding areas. Some surgeons have resected cartilage matching the symptoms of Tietze syndrome under the assumption the cartilage was tubercular. One study describes a case in which surgeons resected a large amount of cartilage, including minutely hypertrophied tissue, as a previous resection failed to relieve symptoms which is believed to be due to improperly resected margins. There is limited literature on surgical treatment of this disease, and overall research on the treatment of severe, chronic forms of Tietze syndrome.

==History==
Tietze syndrome was named after and first described in 1921 by German surgeon Alexander Tietze. Tietze first cited 4 cases in Germany of painful swelling where he originally believed the condition was as a result of tuberculosis or wartime malnutrition.

<doc id="317446" wikidata="Q531892" url="?curid=317446" title="Angel Sanctuary">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kaori Yuki. It was serialized in the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; from July 1994 to November 2000. It follows Setsuna Mudo, a human teenager who, as the reincarnation of a prominent angel who rebelled against Heaven, becomes entangled in political machinations between the angels and demons. The 120 chapters were collected and published in twenty bound volumes by Hakusensha from February 1995 to February 2001. Titled &quot;Coming of the Seraphim&quot; in the early stages of its development, &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was inspired by the Japanese fantasy novel &quot;Nocturne&quot; and was originally slated to be only ten chapters long, which led Yuki to worry about being able to properly end the story. &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; made cultural references to various mythologies, including Greek and Norse, as well as to real-world people, music, literature, and places.

Viz Media published an English-language translation in North America from February 2004 to June 2007. &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was also adapted into a series of drama CDs, published from December 1999 to September 2001, and a three-episode original video animation (OVA) by Bandai Visual and Hal Film Maker published in 2000; Yuki assisted on various aspects of both adaptations. &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was critically and commercially well-received by English-language readers and critics, with Yuki&#x27;s art and narrative highlighted as its strengths. The OVA received more mixed reviews from critics, who were generally divided on whether they enjoyed it as an introduction to the events of the manga or found its content objectionable due to the sibling incest.

==Plot==
Beginning in Japan in 1999, &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; focuses on Setsuna Mudo, a 16-year-old troubled high-school student in love with his 15-year-old sister Sara. While struggling with his incestuous feelings, he learns that he is the reincarnation of Organic Angel Alexiel, who led a rebellion against her fellow angels after witnessing their slaughter of the Evils, a group of demons, after God&#x27;s disappearance. At the conclusion of the revolt, she sealed away her younger twin brother, Inorganic Angel Rosiel, within the Earth, emotionally unable to fulfill his request to be killed before he became insane and destructive. Captured and branded a fallen angel, Alexiel was punished by having her body frozen and her soul endlessly reincarnated as a human whose life is full of misery.

While Rosiel is freed by his subordinate Katan, Setsuna finds his life and Sara&#x27;s endangered by various attempts to awaken Alexiel&#x27;s dormant soul within him. Realizing they cannot bear to be separated, Setsuna and Sara run away together and consummate their love, hoping to start a new life together. Sara eventually dies protecting him from one of Rosiel&#x27;s subordinates, and devastated, Setsuna awakens Alexiel&#x27;s soul, causing widespread damage. Adam Kadamon, the angel closest to God, intervenes by turning back time to just after Alexiel&#x27;s awakening and freezing time on Earth; she then tasks him with freeing her from her imprisonment. To search for Sara&#x27;s soul, sent to Hell for incest, Setsuna&#x27;s body enters a near-death state. While in Hell, his soul searches for hers, eventually learning that it has been taken to Heaven instead. Sara, meanwhile, awakens in the body of Jibriel, the archangel of water held prisoner by the angels; revealed to be Jibriel&#x27;s reincarnation, Sara is eventually returned to her original body but finds herself impregnated by the malicious angel Sandolphon, who hopes that she will bear him a body. After Rosiel absorbs Sandolphon to gain his power, an act which speeds up Rosiel&#x27;s physical and mental decay, Sandolphon&#x27;s remnants possess her, causing her to see Setsuna as a monster.

Assisted by Lucifer, the ruler of the demons who is in love with Alexiel, Rosiel unseals the Tower of Etenamenki, where God rests, with Alexiel&#x27;s body. Intent on restoring the Earth, Setsuna follows him, with Kurai and the archangels of fire and earth; along the way, he aids an injured Katan, who hopes to save Rosiel before he loses his free will to do so. At the tower, Rosiel kills Katan, only to realize that he had killed the one he loved and tried to protect from himself; he then goes into a state of destructive despair. Awakening in her own body with Setsuna&#x27;s help, Alexiel reveals to him that she had always loved him: because he had been born the opposite of his healthy sister, she bargained with God to save his life in exchange for her imprisonment, from which she later escaped with Lucifer, and an agreement to never show him any compassion. She then kills him and absorbs him into her womb so that they will never be apart again. Before dying, Rosiel passes along his power to Setsuna.

Setsuna and his group find Adam Kadamon&#x27;s head, used to nourish the unborn angels, and learn that she attempted to prevent God&#x27;s plan of destroying humanity by hiding him and the tower from the angels and freezing time in hopes that Alexiel&#x27;s reincarnation could save them. Because God draws power through Adam Kadamon, the archangels and Kurai seal her up, while Setsuna confronts God and encounters Sara and Lucifer there. Sara overcomes her possession to cast out Sandolphon, and Setsuna defeats God with Lucifer&#x27;s help. Time returns to normal on Earth, where Setsuna and Sara joyfully reunite at last.

==Development==
According to manga artist Kaori Yuki, the concept for &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; has been with her &quot;for the longest time&quot;. As a middle-school student in her second year, Yuki found the story of fallen angels, particularly Lucifer, fascinating; in &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;, she offered her own interpretation of fictional angels, which differed from her thoughts on actual angels. Yuki was inspired to write about angels and demons in Tokyo after reading the Japanese fantasy novel &quot;Nocturne&quot;; the book centered around a demonic prince and princess who search for another demon on earth, who has possessed an idol singer, and try to destroy it. While the original title for the manga was &quot;Coming of the Seraphim&quot;, Yuki later decided against it in favor of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;, as she thought that &quot;angel&quot; should be included in the title and &quot;sanctuary&quot; had a sense of something &quot;forbidden&quot; or &quot;against God&quot;. Sara, originally named Sana, was the first character designed, while the first episode of the manga imagined was one in which the protagonist&#x27;s love interest &quot;was actually a living angel&quot;. She decided to set &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; in Japan in &quot;near future&quot;, partially because the setting would be largely unchanged and partially because she had a wish to draw modern clothing styles and sailor uniforms.

As she had been already working on a successful serial, the gothic mystery manga &quot;Earl Cain&quot;, she faced difficulty in convincing others to let her begin another serial. Initially, she was allowed only ten installments of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;, which led her to worry about being able to properly end the story. At that time, she had the character development up to Zaphikel&#x27;s death scene and fragments of the plot; she found it difficult to construct a narrative to join the scenes she wanted to draw. The original character designs underwent changes, and only Kato&#x27;s remained unchanged. Several angels were planned to make an appearance, but never did; among them were the Angel of the Yoke and the leader of the angels, Sakaki. For the conclusion, she originally had planned to use a tragic ending, but decided against it in favor of a happy one, because she thought that it would be too upsetting for the fans to read after twenty volumes.
When &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was adapted into an audio drama series, Yuki participated in selecting voice actors; around two to three auditioned for each role. Ten, however, auditioned for the role of Setsuna, with Kenji Nojima ultimately chosen. Ayako Kawasumi provided the voice of Sara, while Takehito Koyasu and Yuuko Miyamura voiced Sakuya Kira and Kurai, respectively. For Arachne, Yuki envisioned a &quot;transvestite&quot; voice actor, which proved to be unfeasible. The antagonists Katan and Rosiel were voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki and Nozomu Sasaki, respectively. Yuki attended several sessions, during which she directed the voice actors and helped them with their interpretations of the characters.

Yuki assisted on &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;″s adaptation into an original video animation (OVA). She helped with the color direction in the first episode; although she prefers the color combinations of white, red, and black, the production staff was interested in including an abundance of color in the anime adaptation to prevent it from seeming &quot;dull&quot;. She also produced character designs with detailed descriptions of various elements, such as eye shape and earrings. Editing the already finished script was the most difficult aspect of the adaptation for her, as time and space constraints resulted in the elimination of some scenes and she felt that sometimes a character&#x27;s personality would be changed. She insisted on the inclusion of certain narrative points, which made it tricky to reach a compromise with the production staff at times. Regardless, she expressed her satisfaction with the finished product. 
===Cultural references and influences===

In &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;, Yuki incorporated references to several mythologies and religions. Greek mythology features prominently, with allusions to the Orpheus&#x27; descent to the underworld, the mythical location Hades, Pandora&#x27;s box, and Prometheus. Additionally, the transgender demon Arachne takes her name from the weaver Arachne. References to Norse mythology also appear, with allusions to Yggdrasil and the dragon Nidhogg. Other mythologies alluded to include Jewish and Christian mythology; Yuki used quotes from the Bible periodically in the series.

Additionally, Yuki included references to real-life people, literature, locations, and music. The Tower of Etenamenki is an allusion to the ziggurat Etemenanki in Babylon. The character Katan shares his name with Katan Amano, a dollmaker. Kira&#x27;s name is a reference to Japanese music group Zabadak&#x27;s Tomohiko Kira, while the minor character Kirie takes her name from a Mr. Mister song. Moonlil, another minor character, was based on Japanese idol singer Hirosue. The Goth subculture in Tokyo, Japan, and rock bands with androgynous musicians influenced the clothing of the angels and demons in the series. References to literature appeared in the series, such as Lewis Carroll&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot;.

==Themes==
Yuki identified &quot;forbidden love&quot; as the theme of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;. Jason Thompson wrote that &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;″s portrayal of incest adhered to the &quot;classical tormented sense&quot; which results in unfavorable consequences for the involved characters, including &quot;guilt, madness, and the punishment of heaven&quot;. One reviewer for &quot;Manga News&quot; remarked that, while &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot;″s premise is centered on the romantic relationship between the protagonists, the series includes more ambiguous portrayals of love, with dedication blending into submission and hatred into passion; love, according to the reviewer, is sometimes synonymous with &quot;hatred, treachery, and suffering&quot;, rather than &quot;happiness and tenderness&quot;.

Other themes and social issues have been discussed. Active Anime&#x27;s Holly Ellingwood wrote that the universe of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; concerned itself with the concepts of good and evil, unconditional love, human nature, and the interpersonal struggle for &quot;love, acceptance, and [...] survival&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;Manga News&quot; wrote that the portrayal of angels and demons in the series challenged the binary of good and evil, with both sides given positive and negative traits; the Evils are additionally shown to be the victims of both the angels and human-caused environmental pollution. In an interview, Yuki drew attention to the tension between science and nature in the series. She wondered if it was possible for the natural world to coexist with science, despite continual, considerable environmental damage as a result of human innovations, and reflected that in the titles of Rosiel and Alexiel, the Inorganic and Organic Angels.

==Media==

===Manga===

The chapters of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; appeared twice a month as a serial in the manga magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; from the 5 July 1994 issue to the 20 October 2000 issue.

Satoshi Kubo, Yoshiyuki Itoh, and Katsunori Haruta served as producers, while Junichiro Nishikawa was the art director. Shuichi Shimamura worked as supervising director and was in charge of character design. Hikaru Nanase composed the OVA&#x27;s music, with Hideyuki Tanaka as sound director. The opening theme song was &quot;MESSIAH&quot;, while the ending theme song, &quot;Knife of romance&quot;, was performed by Phi. Bandai published the episodes individually from 25 May to 25 August 2000.

An English-language translation was licensed in North America by Central Park Media, which published it on 10 July 2001 and re-released it on 24 May 2005. Media Blasters acquired the license for the OVA in 2007, and later re-released it with new cover art.

===Art books===
Hakusensha published two &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; art books: the first, was released on 25 July 1997, and the second, followed on 27 September 2000. Viz Media released English-language translations of both in North America from 6 September 2005 to 30 October 2007.

==Reception==
&quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was nominated for the Grand Prize of the 1st Sense of Gender Award in 2001. The manga series has been well received by English-language readers, with fifteen volumes appearing in ICv2&#x27;s monthly lists of the 100 best-selling graphic novels. The French translation also became a bestseller.

&quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. One reviewer for &quot;Manga News&quot; lauded it as one of the classics of &quot;shōjo&quot; manga and the most popular of Yuki&#x27;s works. Jason Thompson described it in &quot;&quot; as &quot;The archetypical 1990s goth manga&quot;. Yuki&#x27;s artwork received praise as detailed, &quot;breath-taking&quot;, &quot;absorbing&quot;, and &quot;beautiful&quot;, though one reviewer found the art &quot;overcrowded&quot; and had difficulty distinguishing between the male and female characters. While writing that the artwork could have been improved in some instances, most notably in regards to some placements of the characters&#x27; eyes, could have used better placement, Rika Takahashi of &quot;Ex&quot; magazine remarked that the overall quality ranked among some of the best in the horror or occult genre. Critics generally enjoyed the plot as &quot;dense&quot;, intriguing, suspenseful, complex, and quickly paced. Liann Cooper of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; commented that the story of &quot;Angel Sanctuary&quot; was well written, despite the inclusion of shock factors, with enough plot twists to hold the attention of the reader while staying focused on the main narrative. Thompson wrote that the plot was difficult to follow because of the page layouts, the large cast of androgynous characters, and the dense world building. Another reviewer found the plot &quot;confusing&quot; at times and thought that the series&#x27;s topics of gender issues and incest might discourage some readers. The tie-in artbook received similarly positive reviews for Yuki&#x27;s artwork.

The OVA, in contrast, generally received more mixed reviews. Some enjoyed it as a prologue or introduction to the events of the manga, while others were put off by the sibling incest. Critics generally enjoyed the animation, although one reviewer disagreed, writing that the anime disregarded the &quot;delicate&quot; character designs of the manga in favor of artwork that was &quot;nothing special&quot;. The English-language dub, however, was generally not favorably regarded, and one reviewer noted technical issues with its audio syncing.

<doc id="317450" wikidata="Q18341850" url="?curid=317450" title="Mortar and pestle">
<text>A mortar and pestle is a set of two simple tools used to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder in the kitchen, laboratory, and pharmacy. The &quot;mortar&quot; () is characteristically a bowl, typically made of hardwood, metal, ceramic, or hard stone such as granite. The &quot;pestle&quot; (, ) is a blunt, club-shaped object. The substance to be ground, which may be wet or dry, is placed in the mortar where the pestle is pounded, pressed, or rotated into the substance until the desired texture is achieved.

Mortars and pestles have been used in cooking since the Stone Age; today they are typically associated with the pharmacy profession due to their historical use in preparing medicines. They are used in chemistry settings for pulverizing small amounts of chemicals; in arts and cosmetics for pulverizing pigments, binders, and other substances; in ceramics for making grog; in masonry and other types of construction requiring pulverized materials. In cooking, they are typically used to crush spices, to make pesto, and certain cocktails such as the mojito, which requires the gentle crushing of sugar, ice, and mint leaves in the glass with a pestle.

The invention of mortars and pestles seems related to that of quern-stones, which use a similar principle of naturally indented, durable, hard stone bases and mallets of stone or wood to process food and plant materials, clay, or minerals by stamping, crushing, pulverizing and grinding.

A key advantage of the mortar is that it presents a deeper bowl for confining the material to be ground without the waste and spillage that occur with flat grinding stones. Another advantage is that the mortar can be made large enough for a person to stand upright and adjacent to it and use the combined strength of their upper body and the force of gravity for better stamping. Large mortars allow some individuals with several pestles to stamp the material faster and more efficiently. Working over a large mortar that a person can stand next to is physically easier and more ergonomic (by ensuring a better posture of the whole body) than for a small quern, where a person has to crouch and use the uncomfortable, repetitive motion of hand grinding by sliding.

Mortars and pestles predate modern blenders and grinders and can be described as having the function of small, mobile, hand-operated mills that do not require electricity or fuel to operate.

Large wooden mortars and wooden pestles would predate and lead to the invention of butter churns, as domestication of livestock and use of dairy (during the Neolithic) came well after the mortar and pestle. Butter would be churned from cream or milk in a wooden container with a long wooden stick, very like the use of wooden mortars and pestles.

Mortars and pestles were invented in the Stone Age when humans found that processing food and various other materials by grinding and crushing into smaller particles allowed for improved use and various advantages. Hard grains could be cooked and digested more easily if ground first, grinding potsherds into grog would vastly improve fired clay, and larger objects such as blocks of salt would be much easier to handle and use. Various stone mortars and pestles have been found, while wooden or clay ones would perish much more easily over time.

Scientists have found ancient mortars and pestles in Southwest Asia that date back to approximately 35000 BC.

Stone mortars and pestles have also been used by the Kebaran culture (the Levant with Sinai) from 22000 to 18000 BC to crush grains and other plant material. The Kebaran mortars that have been found are sculpted, slightly conical bowls of porous stone, and the pestles are made of a smoother type of stone.

Another Stone Age example is the rock mortars in the Raqefet Cave in Israel, which are natural cavities in the cave floors, used by Late Natufians around 10000 BC to grind cereals for brewing beer in the cavities. These rock mortars are large enough for a person to stand upright by them and crush the cereals inside the cavity with a long wooden pestle.

Ancient Africans, Sumerians, Egyptians, Thai, Laos People, Polynesians, Native Americans, Chinese, Indians, Greeks, Celts, and countless other people used mortars and pestles for processing materials and substances for cooking, arts, cosmetics, simple chemicals, ceramics and medicine.

Since the 14th century, bronze mortars became more popular than stone ones, especially for use in alchemy and early chemistry. Bronze mortars would become more elaborate than stone ones, had the advantage to be harder, and were easily cast with handles, knobs for handling, and spouts for easier pouring. However, the big disadvantage was that bronze would react with acids and other chemicals and corrode easily. Since the late 17th century, glazed porcelain mortars became very useful, since they would not be damaged by chemicals and would be easy to clean.

=== Etymology ===
The English word &quot;mortar&quot; derives from Middle English &#x27;, from old French &#x27;, from classical Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning, among several other usages, &quot;receptacle for pounding&quot; and &quot;product of grinding or pounding&quot;; perhaps related to Sanskrit &quot;mrnati&quot; - to crush, to bruise.

The classical Latin , meaning &quot;pounder&quot;, led to the English &quot;pestle&quot;. Stemming from the pistillum, the word pesto in Italian cuisine means created with the pestle.

The Roman poet Juvenal applied both &quot;mortarium&quot; and &quot;pistillum&quot; to articles used in the preparation of drugs, reflecting the early use of the mortar and pestle as a symbol of a pharmacist or apothecary.

Mortar as a synonym for cement in masonry came from the use of mortars and pestles to grind the materials for creating cement. The short bombard cannon was called &quot;mortar&quot; in French because the first versions of these cannons looked like big metal mortars of the Medieval Ages and they required to be filled with gunpowder, like a mortar would be full of powdered material.
=== The mortar and pestle in culture and symbols === 

The antiquity of the mortar and pestle is well documented in early writing, such as the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus of around 1550 BC (the oldest preserved piece of medical literature) and the Old Testament (Numbers 11:8 and Proverbs 27:22).

In Indian mythology, Samudra Manthan from Bhagavata Purana creates amrita, the nectar of immortality, by churning the ocean with a pestle.

Since medieval times, mortars would be placed or carved on the gravestones of pharmacists and doctors.

In Russian and Eastern European folklore, Baba Yaga is described and pictured as flying through the forest standing inside a large wooden mortar (stupa), holding the long wooden pestle in one hand to remove obstacles in front of her, and using the broom in her other hand to sweep and remove her traces behind her. This seems as a trace of some ancient rituals connecting the witch symbols of Baba Yaga with the use of mortars in alchemy, pharmacy, and early chemistry, which were all seen as magic by uneducated people in the Medieval Ages. 

In various Asian mythologies and folklores, there is a common theme of a Moon rabbit, making use of a mortar and pestle to process the ingredients for the &quot;Elixir of life&quot; (or rice for making mochi). 

Modern pharmacies, especially in Germany, still use mortars and pestles as logos.

== Uses ==

=== Medicine ===
Mortars and pestles were traditionally used in pharmacies to crush various ingredients before preparing an extemporaneous prescription. The mortar and pestle, with the Rod of Asclepius, the Green Cross, and others, is one of the most pervasive symbols of pharmacology.

For pharmaceutical use, the mortar and the head of the pestle are usually made of porcelain, while the handle of the pestle is made of wood. This is known as a Wedgwood mortar and pestle and originated in 1759. Today the act of mixing ingredients or reducing the particle size is known as trituration.

Mortars and pestles are also used as drug paraphernalia to grind up pills to speed up absorption when they are ingested, or in preparation for insufflation. To finely ground drugs, not available in the liquid dosage form are used also if patients need artificial nutrition such as parenteral nutrition or by nasogastric tube.

=== Food preparation ===
Mortars are also used in cooking to prepare wet or oily ingredients such as guacamole, hummus, and pesto (which derives its name from the pestle pounding), as well as grinding spices into powder. The molcajete, a version used by pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican cultures including the Aztec and Maya, stretching back several thousand years, is made of basalt and is used widely in Mexican cooking. Other Native American nations use mortars carved into the bedrock to grind acorns and other nuts. Many such depressions can be found in their territories.

In Japan, very large mortars are used with wooden mallets to prepare mochi. A regular-sized Japanese mortar and pestle are called a &quot;suribachi&quot; and &quot;surikogi&quot;, respectively. Granite mortars and pestles are used in Southeast Asia, as well as Pakistan and India. In India, it is used extensively to make spice mixtures for various delicacies as well as day-to-day dishes. With the advent of motorized grinders, the use of the mortar and pestle has decreased. It is traditional in various Hindu ceremonies (such as weddings, and upanayanam) to crush turmeric in these mortars.

In Malay, it is known as &quot;batu lesung&quot;. Large stone mortars, with long (2–3 foot) wood pestles were used in West Asia to grind meat for a type of meatloaf, or kibbeh, as well as the hummus variety known as masabcha. In Indonesia mortar is known as &quot;Cobek&quot; or &quot;Tjobek&quot; and pestle is known as &quot;Ulekan&quot; or &quot;Oelekan&quot;. The chobek is shaped like a deep saucer or plate. The ulekan is either pistol-shaped or ovoid. It is often used to make fresh sambal, a spicy chili condiment, hence the &quot;sambal ulek/oelek&quot; denotes its process using pestle. It is also used to grind peanuts and other ingredients to make peanut sauce for gado-gado.

=== Husking and dehulling ===
Large mortars and pestles are still commonly used in developing countries to husk and dehull grain. These are usually made of wood, and operated by one or more persons.

In the Philippines, mortar and pestles are specifically associated with de-husking rice. A notable traditional mortar and pestle is the boat-shaped &quot;bangkang pinawa&quot; or &quot;bangkang pangpinawa&quot;, literally &quot;boat (&quot;bangka&quot;) for unpolished rice&quot;, usually carved from a block of molave or other hardwood. It is pounded by two or three people. The name for the mortar, &quot;lusong&quot;, is the origin of the name of the largest island in the Philippines, Luzon.

Large wooden mortars and pestles have been used to hull grain in West Africa for centuries. When enslaved Africans were brought to the Americas, they brought this technology—and knowledge of how to use it—with them. During the Middle Passage, some slave ships carried un-hulled rice, and enslaved African women were tasked with using mortars and pestles to prepare it for consumption. In both colonial North and South America, rice continued to be primarily milled by hand in this way until around the mid-1700s when mechanical mills became more widespread.

== Material ==
Good mortar and pestle-making materials must be hard enough to crush the substance rather than be worn away by it. They cannot be too brittle either, or they will break during the pounding and grinding. The material should also be cohesive so that small bits of the mortar or pestle do not mix in with the ingredients. Smooth and non-porous materials are chosen that will not absorb or trap the substances being ground.

In food preparation, a rough or absorbent material may cause the strong flavor of a past ingredient to be tasted in food prepared later. Also, the food particles left in the mortar and on the pestle may support the growth of microorganisms. When dealing with medications, the previously prepared drugs may interact or mix, contaminating the currently used ingredients.

Rough ceramic mortar and pestle sets can be used to reduce substances to very fine powders, but stain easily and are brittle. Porcelain mortars are sometimes conditioned for use by grinding some sand to give them a rougher surface which helps to reduce the particle size. Glass mortars and pestles are fragile, but stain-resistant and suitable for use with liquids. However, they do not grind as finely as the ceramic type.

Other materials used include stone, often marble or agate, wood (which is highly absorbent), bamboo, iron, steel, brass, and basalt. Mortar and pestle sets made from the wood of old grape vines have proved reliable for grinding salt and pepper at the dinner table. Uncooked rice is sometimes ground in mortars to clean them. This process must be repeated until the rice comes out completely white. Some stones, such as molcajete, need to be seasoned first before use. Metal mortars are kept lightly oiled.

== Automatic mortar grinder ==
Since the results obtained with hand grinding are not easily reproducible, most laboratories use automatic mortar grinders. Grinding time and pressure of the mortar can be adjusted and fixed, saving time and labor.

The first automatic Mortar Grinder was invented by F. Kurt Retsch in 1923 and named the &quot;Retschmill&quot; after him.

== Advantages ==
The use of mortar and pestle, pestling, offers the advantage that the substance is crushed with low energy so that the substance will not warm up.

<text>Sydney Cove (Eora: ) is a bay on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, one of several harbours in Port Jackson, on the coast of Sydney, New South Wales. Sydney Cove is a focal point for community celebrations, due to its central Sydney location between the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 

Sydney Cove was the site of the First Fleet&#x27;s landing on 26 January 1788 and the subsequent raising of the Union Jack, a seminal date in Australian history now marked as Australia Day. 

==History ==
The Eora name for Sydney Cove was recorded by several early settlers of the First Fleet variously spelt as Warrane, War-ran, Warrang and Wee-rong. The spot is of great significance, as the first meeting place between Eora people and Europeans. Before colonisation of the area, Eora men speared fish from the shoreline, and women line-fished from their &quot;&quot; (canoes).

Sydney Cove was named after the British Home Secretary, the 1st Baron Sydney (who was later created 1st Viscount Sydney in 1789). It was the site chosen by Captain Arthur Phillip, RN between 21 and 23 January 1788 for the British penal settlement which is now the city of Sydney, and where possession of New South Wales was formally declared on 26 January (now commemorated as Australia Day). Today, the exact site where the flag was planted is unmarked, being a spot near the bottom of Bethel Steps, The Rocks (behind the south end of the present Overseas Passenger Terminal) This site on the west side of the Cove is confirmed by a 1789 letter by John Campbell.

Phillip had been instructed to establish the settlement at Botany Bay, a large bay further south of Sydney Cove which had been discovered by Lieutenant James Cook during his voyage of discovery in 1770, and was recommended by the eminent botanist Sir Joseph Banks, who had accompanied Cook, as a suitable site for a settlement. But Phillip discovered that Botany Bay offered neither a secure anchorage nor a reliable source of fresh water. Sydney Cove offered both of these, being serviced by a freshwater creek which was soon to be known as the Tank Stream.
===Sydney Cove Medallion===
A sample of the dark grey clay of Sydney Cove was collected by Governor Phillip and given to Sir Joseph Banks, who gave it to pottery maker Josiah Wedgwood to test for suitability for making pottery. Wedgwood found it excellent and made a commemorative medal that became known as the Sydney Cove Medallion.

==Today==
The cove is dual-named as Warrane, the name by which it was known by the Eora people.

The Tank Stream is encased in a concrete drain beneath the streets of the central business district and all native bushland has been cleared. The head of the cove is occupied by the Circular Quay ferry terminal. On Bennelong Point at the northern end of the eastern shore of the cove stands the Sydney Opera House. On the western shore is the historic district known as The Rocks.

Sydney Cove is a focal point for community celebrations, due to its central Sydney location between the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is also one of the main congregation points for Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve and Australia Day events.

<text>Tietz syndrome, also called Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome or albinism and deafness of Tietz, is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by deafness and leucism. It is caused by a mutation in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (&quot;MITF&quot;) gene. Tietz syndrome was first described in 1963 by Walter Tietz (1927–2003) a German Physician working in California.

== Presentation ==
Tietz syndrome is characterized by profound hearing loss from birth, white hair and pale skin (hair color may darken over time to blond or red).

The hearing loss is caused by abnormalities of the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss) and is present from birth. Individuals with Tietz syndrome often have skin and hair color that is lighter than those of other family members.

Tietz syndrome also affects the eyes. The iris in affected individuals is blue, and specialized cells in the eye called retinal pigment epithelial cells lack their normal pigment. The changes to these cells are generally detectable only by an eye examination; it is unclear whether the changes affect vision.

== Cause ==

Tietz syndrome is caused by mutations in the &quot;MITF&quot; gene, located on human chromosome 3p14.1-p12.3. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This indicates that the defective gene responsible for a disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 3 is an autosome), and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder, when inherited from a parent who has the disorder.

==Treatment==
There is currently no treatment or cure for Tietz syndrome. The symptom most likely to be of practical importance is sensorineural deafness, and this is treated as any other irreversible deafness would be. In marked cases, there may be cosmetic issues. Other abnormalities (neurological, structural, Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease) associated with the syndrome are treated symptomatically.

<doc id="317454" wikidata="Q7181286" url="?curid=317454" title="Phelsuma laticauda angularis">
<text>Phelsuma laticauda angularis is a diurnal subspecies of geckos. It lives in northern Madagascar and typically inhabits different trees and houses. The Gold dust day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard is slightly smaller than the nominate form. It can reach a total length of about . The body colour is a bright green or yellowish green or rarely even blue. Typical for this day gecko are the yellow speckles on the neck and the upper back. There are three rust-coloured transverse bars on the snout and head. The upper eyelid is blue. In contrast to the nominate form, there is a wide, irregular, v-shaped marking which points to the head on the lower back. The tail is wider and flatter than in &quot;Phelsuma laticauda laticauda&quot;. The ventral side is off-white.

== Distribution ==
This day gecko inhabits northwest Madagascar. It is only known from the region around Antsohihy.

== Habitat ==
&quot;P. laticauda angularis&quot; inhabits different trees, and other pantropic vegetation.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

== Behaviour ==
The males of this species are apparently not as aggressive as &quot;Phelsuma laticauda laticauda&quot;.

== Reproduction ==
The females lay up to 5 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 40–45 days. The juveniles measure 55–60 mm. They should be kept separately since even the juveniles can be quite quarrelsome. Sexual maturity is reached after 10–12 months.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals can be housed in pairs or small groups with one male and several females. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be about 28 °C during the day and drop to around 20 °C at night. The humidity should be maintained between 65 and 75%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth, fruits flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<doc id="317455" wikidata="Q33441" url="?curid=317455" title="Friulian language">
<text>Friulian ( ) or Friulan (natively or ; ; ; ) is a Romance language belonging to the Rhaeto-Romance family. Friulian is spoken in the Friuli region of northeastern Italy and has around 600,000 speakers, the vast majority of whom also speak Italian. It is sometimes called Eastern Ladin since it shares the same roots as Ladin, but over the centuries, it has diverged under the influence of surrounding languages, including German, Italian, Venetian, and Slovene. Documents in Friulian are attested from the 11th century and poetry and literature date as far back as 1300. By the 20th century, there was a revival of interest in the language.

== History ==

A question that causes many debates is the influence of the Latin spoken in Aquileia and surrounding areas. Some claim that it had peculiar features that later passed into Friulian. Epigraphs and inscriptions from that period show some variants if compared to the standard Latin language, but most of them are common to other areas of the Roman Empire. Often, it is cited that Fortunatianus, the bishop of Aquileia 342–357 AD, wrote a commentary to the Gospel in &quot;sermo rusticus&quot; (the common/ language), which, therefore, would have been quite divergent from the standard Latin of administration. The text itself did not survive so its language cannot be examined, but its attested existence testifies to a shift of languages while, for example, other important communities of Northern Italy were still speaking Latin. The languages spoken before the arrival of the Romans in 181 BC were Rhaetic, Venetic and Celtic. The inhabitants belonged to the Raeti, a likely pre-Indo-European language population, the Italic Veneti, and the Carni, a Celtic population. In modern Friulian, the words of Rhaetic, Venetic or Celtic origin include terms referring to mountains, woods, plants, or animals, as well as local toponyms and onomastics (e.g. names of villages with &quot;-acco&quot;, &quot;-icco&quot;). Even influences from the Lombardic language — Friuli was one of their strongholds — are present. In a similar manner, there is a unique connection to the modern, nearby Lombard language.

In Friulian, there is also a plethora of words of German, Slovenian and Venetian origin. From that evidence, scholars today agree that the formation of new Friulian dates back to circa 500 AD, at the same time as other dialects derived from Latin (see Vulgar Latin). The first written records of new Friulian have been found in administrative acts of the 13th century, but the documents became more frequent in the following century, when literary works also emerged (&quot;Frammenti letterari&quot; for example). The main centre at that time was Cividale. The Friulian language has never acquired primary official status: legal statutes were first written in Latin, then in Venetian and finally in Italian.

=== The &quot;Ladin Question&quot; ===
The idea of unity among Ladin, Romansh and Friulian comes from the Italian historical linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, who was born in Gorizia. In 1871, he presented his theory that these three languages are part of one family, which in the past stretched from Switzerland to Muggia and perhaps also Istria. The three languages are the only survivors of this family and all developed differently. Friulian was much less influenced by German. The scholar Francescato claimed subsequently that until the 14th century, the Venetian language shared many phonetic features with Friulian and Ladin and so he thought that Friulian was a much more conservative language. Many features that Ascoli thought were peculiar to the Rhaeto-Romance languages can, in fact, be found in other languages of Northern Italy.

== Areas ==

=== Italy ===
Today, Friulian is spoken in the province of Udine, including the area of the Carnia Alps, but as well throughout the province of Pordenone, in half of the province of Gorizia, and in the eastern part of the province of Venice. In the past, the language borders were wider since in Trieste and Muggia, local variants of Friulian were spoken. The main document about the dialect of Trieste, or &quot;tergestino&quot;, is &quot;Dialoghi piacevoli in dialetto vernacolo triestino&quot;, published by G. Mainati in 1828.

=== World ===
Friuli was, until the 1960s, an area of deep poverty, causing a large number of Friulian speakers to emigrate. Most went to France, Belgium, and Switzerland or outside Europe, to Canada, Mexico, Australia, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, the United States, and South Africa. In those countries, there are associations of Friulian immigrants (called &quot;Fogolâr furlan&quot;) that try to protect their traditions and language.

== Literature ==
The first texts in Friulian date back to the 13th century and are mainly commercial or juridical acts. The examples show that Friulian was used together with Latin, which was still the administrative language. The main examples of literature that have survived (much from this period has been lost) are poems from the 14th century and are usually dedicated to the theme of love and are probably inspired by the Italian poetic movement Dolce Stil Novo. The most notable work is &quot;Piruç myò doç inculurit&quot; (which means &quot;My pear, all colored&quot;); it was composed by an anonymous author from Cividale del Friuli, probably in 1380.

There are few differences in the first two rows, which demonstrates that there has not been a great evolution in the language except for several words which are no longer used (for example, , a word which means &quot;child&quot;). A modern Friulian speaker can understand these texts with only little difficulty.

The second important period for Friulian literature is the 16th century. The main author of this period was Ermes di Colorêt, who composed over 200 poems.
== Phonology ==
===Consonants===
Notes:
* are bilabial, whereas are labiodental and is labiovelar.
* Note that, in the standard language, a phonemic distinction exists between true palatal stops and palatoalveolar affricates . The former (written ) originate from Latin before , whereas the latter (written , where is found before and , and is found elsewhere) originate primarily from Latin before and . The palatalization of Latin and before is characteristic of the Rhaeto-Romance languages and is also found in French and some Occitan varieties. In some Friulian dialects (e.g. Western dialects), corresponding to Central are found . Note in addition that, due to various sound changes, these sounds are all now phonemic; note, for example, the minimal pair &#x27; &quot;drunk&quot; vs. &#x27; &quot;log&quot;.

===Vowels===

===Orthography===
Some notes on orthography (from the perspective of the standard, i.e. Central, dialect):
* Long vowels are indicated with a circumflex: .
* is used for both (which only occurs in stressed syllables) and ; similarly, is used for both and .
* is spelled word-initially, and elsewhere.
* occurs primarily in diphthongs, and is spelled .
* is normally spelled , but is spelled between vowels (in this context, a single is pronounced ).
* is spelled , which can also occur word-finally.
* is an allophone of , found word-finally, before word-final &quot;-s&quot;, and often in the prefix &quot;in-&quot;. Both sounds are spelled .
* is normally spelled , but before and , as in Italian.
* is normally spelled , but before and , again as in Italian.
* The palatal stops are spelled . Note that in some dialects, these sounds are pronounced , as described above.
* is spelled before and , elsewhere. Note that in some dialects, this sound is pronounced .
* is spelled . Note that in some dialects, this sound is pronounced .
* can also represent or in certain words (e.g. &quot;nazion&quot; &quot;nation&quot;, &quot;lezion&quot; &quot;lesson&quot;).
* is silent.
* is no longer used except in the traditional spelling of certain proper names; similarly for before and .

===Long vowels and their origin===
Long vowels are typical of the Friulian language and greatly influence the Friulian pronunciation of Italian.

Friulian distinguishes between short and long vowels: in the following minimal pairs (long vowels are marked in the official orthography with a circumflex accent):
: &quot;lat&quot; (milk)
: &quot;lât&quot; (gone)
: &quot;fis&quot; (fixed, dense)
: &quot;fîs&quot; (sons)
: &quot;lus&quot; (luxury)
: &quot;lûs&quot; (light n.)

Friulian dialects differ in their treatment of long vowels. In certain dialects, some of the long vowels are actually diphthongs. The following chart shows how six words (&quot;sêt&quot; thirst, &quot;pît&quot; foot, &quot;fîl&quot; &quot;wire&quot;, &quot;pôc&quot; (a) little, &quot;fûc&quot; fire, &quot;mûr&quot; &quot;wall&quot;) are pronounced in four dialects. Each dialect uses a unique pattern of diphthongs (yellow) and monophthongs (blue) for the long vowels:

Note that the vowels &quot;î&quot; and &quot;û&quot; in the standard language (based on the Central dialects) correspond to two different sounds in the Western dialects (including Codroipo). These sounds are not distributed randomly but correspond to different origins: Latin short in an open syllable produces Western but Central , whereas Latin long produces in both dialects. Similarly, Latin short in an open syllable produces Western but Central , whereas Latin long produces in both dialects. The word &quot;mûr&quot;, for example, means both &quot;wall&quot; (Latin ) and &quot;(he, she, it) dies&quot; (Vulgar Latin * from Latin ); both words are pronounced in Central dialects, but respectively and in Western dialects.

Long consonants (ll, rr, and so on), frequently used in Italian, are usually absent in Friulian.

Friulian long vowels originate primarily from vowel lengthening in stressed open syllables when the following vowel was lost. Friulian vowel length has no relation to vowel length in Classical Latin. For example, Latin yields &quot;vâl&quot; &quot;it is worth&quot; with a long vowel, but Latin yields &quot;val&quot; &quot;valley&quot; with a short vowel. Long vowels aren&#x27;t found when the following vowel is preserved, e.g.:
* before final -e &lt; Latin , cf. short &quot;gnove&quot; &quot;new (fem. sg.)&quot; &lt; Latin vs. long &quot;gnûf&quot; &quot;new (masc. sg.)&quot; &lt; Latin ;
* before a non-final preserved vowel, cf. &quot;tivit&quot; &quot;tepid, lukewarm&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;zinar&quot; &quot;son-in-law&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;ridi&quot; &quot;to laugh&quot; &lt; Vulgar Latin (Classical ).

It is quite possible that vowel lengthening occurred originally in all stressed open syllables, and was later lost in non-final syllables. Evidence of this is found, for example, in the divergent outcome of Vulgar Latin , which becomes in originally closed syllables but in Central Friulian in originally open syllables, including when non-finally. Examples: &quot;siet&quot; &quot;seven&quot; &lt; Vulgar Latin &lt; Latin , word-final &quot;pît&quot; &quot;foot&quot; &lt; Vulgar Latin &lt; Latin , non-word-final &quot;tivit&quot; &quot;tepid, lukewarm&quot; &lt; Vulgar Latin &lt; Latin .

An additional source of vowel length is compensatory lengthening before lost consonants in certain circumstances, cf. &quot;pâri&quot; &quot;father&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;vôli&quot; &quot;eye&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;lîre&quot; &quot;pound&quot; &lt; Latin . This produces long vowels in non-final syllables, and was apparently a separate, later development than the primary lengthening in open syllables. Note, for example, the development of Vulgar Latin in this context: &gt; &gt; &quot;iê&quot; , as in &quot;piêre&quot; &quot;stone&quot; &lt; Latin , differing from the outcome in originally open syllables (see above).

Additional complications:
* Central Friulian has lengthening before even in originally closed syllables, cf. &quot;cjâr&quot; &quot;cart&quot; &lt; Latin (homophonous with &quot;cjâr&quot; &quot;dear [masc. sg.]&quot; &lt; Latin ). This represents a late, secondary development, and some conservative dialects have the expected length distinction here.
* Lengthening doesn&#x27;t occur before nasal consonants even in originally open syllables, cf. &quot;pan&quot; &quot;bread&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;prin&quot; &quot;first&quot; &lt; Latin .
* Special developments produced absolutely word-final long vowels and length distinctions, cf. &quot;fi&quot; &quot;fig&quot; &lt; Latin vs. &quot;fî&quot; &quot;son&quot; &lt; Latin , &quot;no&quot; &quot;no&quot; &lt; Latin vs. &quot;nô&quot; &quot;we&quot; &lt; Latin .

Synchronic analyses of vowel length in Friulian often claim that it occurs predictably in final syllables before an underlying voiced obstruent, which is then devoiced. Analyses of this sort have difficulty with long-vowel contrasts that occur non-finally (e.g. &quot;pâri&quot; &quot;father&quot; mentioned above) or not in front of obstruents (e.g. &quot;fi&quot; &quot;fig&quot; vs. &quot;fî&quot; &quot;son&quot;, &quot;val&quot; &quot;valley&quot; vs. &quot;vâl&quot; &quot;it is worth&quot;).

== Morphology ==
Friulian is quite different from Italian in its morphology; it is, in many respects, closer to French.

=== Nouns ===
In Friulian as in other Romance languages, nouns are either masculine or feminine (for example, &quot;il mûr&quot; (&quot;the wall&quot;, masculine), &quot;la cjadree&quot; (&quot;the chair&quot;, feminine).

==== Feminine ====
Most feminine nouns end in &quot;-e&quot;, which is pronounced, unlike in Standard French:

* &quot;cjase&quot; = house (from Latin &quot;casa, -ae&quot; hut)
* &quot;lune&quot; = moon (from Latin &quot;luna, -ae&quot;)
* &quot;scuele&quot; = school (from Latin &quot;schola, -ae&quot;)

Some feminine nouns, however, end in a consonant, including those ending in &quot;-zion&quot;, which are from Latin.
* &quot;man&quot; = hand (from Latin &quot;manŭs, -ūs&quot; f)
* &quot;lezion&quot; = lesson (from Latin &quot;lectio, -nis&quot; f

Note that in some Friulian dialects the -e feminine ending is actually an -a or an -o, which characterize the dialect area of the language and are referred to as &quot;a/o-ending dialects&quot; (e.g. is spelled as or the latter being the oldest form of the feminine ending).

==== Masculine ====
Most masculine nouns end either in a consonant or in &quot;-i&quot;.
* &quot;cjan&quot; = dog
* &quot;gjat&quot; = cat
* &quot;fradi&quot; = brother
* &quot;libri&quot; = book

A few masculine nouns end in &quot;-e&quot;, including &quot;sisteme&quot; (system) and &quot;probleme&quot; (problem). They are usually words coming from Ancient Greek. However, because most masculine nouns end in a consonant, it is common to find the forms &quot;sistem&quot; and &quot;problem&quot; instead, more often in print than in speech.

There are also a number of masculine nouns borrowed intact from Italian, with a final &quot;-o&quot;, like &quot;treno&quot; (train). Many of the words have been fully absorbed into the language and even form their plurals with the regular Friulian &quot;-s&quot; rather than the Italian desinence changing. Still, there are some purists, including those influential in Friulian publishing, who frown on such words and insist that the &quot;proper&quot; Friulian terms should be without the final &quot;-o&quot;. Despite the fact that one almost always hears &quot;treno&quot;, it is almost always written &quot;tren&quot;.

=== Articles ===
The Friulian definite article (which corresponds to &quot;the&quot; in English) is derived from the Latin &quot;ille&quot; and takes the following forms:
Before a vowel, both &quot;il&quot; and &quot;la&quot; can be abbreviated to l&#x27; in the standard forms - for example &quot;il + arbul&quot; (the tree) becomes &quot;l&#x27;arbul.&quot; Yet, as far as the article &quot;la&quot; is concerned, modern grammar recommends that its non elided form should be preferred over the elided one: &quot;la acuile (the eagle)&quot; although in speech the two &quot;a&quot; sounds are pronounced as a single one. In the spoken language, various other articles are used.

The indefinite article in Friulian (which corresponds to &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; in English) derives from the Latin &quot;unus&quot; and varies according to gender:
A partitive article also exists: des for feminine and dai for masculine: – &quot;some cows&quot; and &quot;dai libris&quot; - &quot;some books&quot;

=== Adjectives ===
A Friulian adjective must agree in gender and number with the noun it qualifies. Most adjectives have four forms for singular (masculine and feminine) and plural (masculine and feminine):

(Like for nouns, for a/o-ending dialects the plural is simply obtained by adding an &quot;s -&quot; e.g. &quot;brute&quot; corresponds to &quot;bruta/bruto&quot; and its plural form &quot;brutis&quot; is &quot;brutas/brutos&quot;).

The feminine is formed in several ways from the masculine:
* in most cases, all that is needed is -e (short: &quot;curt&quot;, &quot;curte&quot;)
* if the final letter is a -c, the feminine can end with -cje, -gje, -che, -ghe (little: pôc, pôcje)
* if the final letter is a -f, the feminine can end with -ve (new: &quot;gnûf, gnove&quot;)
* if the final letter is a -p, the feminine can end with -be (sour: &quot;garp, garbe&quot;)
* if the final letter is a -t, the feminine can end with -de (green: &quot;vert, verde&quot;)

=== Plurals ===
To form the plural of masculine and feminine nouns ending in -e, the -e is changed to -is (whilst a/o-ending dialects simply add an s)
* , = table, tables
* , = house, houses
* , = moon, moons
* , = school, schools
* , = system, systems
* , = glove, gloves
* , = niece, nieces

The plural of almost all other nouns is just -s. It is always pronounced as voiceless [s], as in English &quot;cats&quot;, never as voiced [z], as in &quot;dogs&quot;.
* , = hand, hands
* , = lesson, lessons
* , = dog, dogs
* , = cat, cats
* , = brother, brothers
* , = book, books
* , = train, trains
* , = arm, arms (from Latin &quot;bracchium&quot;)
* , = glove, gloves (compare English &quot;gauntlet&quot;)

In some Friulian dialects, there are many words whose final consonant becomes silent when the -s is added. The words include just about all those whose singular form ends in -t. The plural of , for example, is written as but is pronounced in much of Friuli as if it were . The plural of &#x27;dish&#x27;, though written as , is often pronounced as . Other words in this category include &quot;clâf&quot; (key) and &quot;clap&quot; (stone), whose plural forms, clâfs and claps, are often pronounced with no f or p, respectively (clâs, clas) so the longer a in the former is all that distinguishes it from the latter. A final -ç, which is pronounced either as the English &quot;-ch&quot; (in central Friulian) or as &quot;-s&quot;, is pluralized in writing as -çs, regardless of whether the pluralized pronunciation is &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-ts&quot; (it varies according to dialect): messaç / messaçs (message).

==== Exceptions ====
Masculine nouns ending in -l or -li form their plurals by palatalising final -l or -li to -i.
* , = horse, horses (from Latin &quot;caballus&quot;)
* , = string, strings (from Latin &quot;filum&quot;)
* , = hat, hats
* , = hair, hairs
* , = eye, eyes
* , = knee, knees (from Latin &quot;genu&quot;)
Notice how these very often correspond to French nouns that form an irregular plural in -&quot;x&quot;: &quot;cheval-chevaux, chapeau-chapeaux, cheveu-cheveux, oeil-yeux, genou-genoux&quot;.

Feminine nouns ending in -l have regular plurals.
* &quot;piel&quot;, &quot;piels&quot; = skin, skins
* &quot;val&quot;, &quot;vals&quot; (in northern Friulian also &quot;tal&quot;, &quot;tals&quot;) = valley, valleys

Masculine nouns ending in -st form their plurals by palatalising the final -t to -cj
* &quot;cavalarist&quot;, &quot;cavalariscj&quot; = military horseman, military horsemen
* &quot;test&quot;, &quot;tescj&quot; = text, texts

Some masculine nouns ending in -t form their plurals by palatalising the final -t to -cj:
* , = tooth, teeth (from Latin &quot;dens, -tis&quot;)
* , = all (of one thing), all (of several things) (from Latin &quot;totus&quot;)

Nouns ending in &quot;s&quot; do not change spelling in the plural, but some speakers may pronounce the plural -s differently from the singular -s.
* &quot;vues&quot; = bone, bones
* &quot;pes&quot; = fish (singular or plural) (from Latin &quot;piscis&quot;)
* &quot;mês&quot; = month, months (from Latin &quot;mensis&quot;)

The plural of &quot;an&quot; (year) has several forms depending on dialect, including &quot;ain&quot;, &quot;ains&quot;, &quot;agn&quot; and &quot;agns&quot;. Regardless of pronunciation, the written form is &quot;agns&quot;.

The same happens for the adjective &quot;bon&quot; (good), as its plural is .

=== Clitic subject pronouns ===
A feature of Friulian are the clitic subject pronouns. Known in Friulian as &quot;pleonastics&quot;, they are never stressed; they are used together with the verb to express the subject and can be found before the verb in declarative sentences or immediately after it in case of interrogative or vocative (&quot;optative&quot;) sentences.

An example: &quot;jo o lavori&quot; means &quot;I work&quot;; &quot;lavorio?&quot; means &quot;Do I work?&quot;, while &quot;lavorassio&quot; means &quot;I wish I worked&quot;.

=== Verbs ===
* Friulian verbal infinitives have one of four endings, -â, -ê, -i, -î; removing the ending gives the root, used to form the other forms (&quot;fevelâ&quot;, to speak; root &quot;fevel-&quot;), but in the case of irregular verbs, the root changes. They are common (&quot;jessi&quot;, to be; &quot;vê&quot;, to have; &quot;podê&quot;, to be able to). Verbs are frequently used in combination with adverbs to restrict the meaning.

=== Adverbs ===
An adjective can be made into an adverb by adding -mentri to the ending of the feminine singular form of the adjective (&quot;lente&quot; becomes &quot;lentementri&quot;, slowly), but it can sometimes lose the -e of the adjective (&quot;facile&quot; becomes &quot;facilmentri&quot;, easily). It is more common in the written language; in the spoken language people frequently use other forms or locutions (&quot;a planc&quot; for slowly).

== Vocabulary ==
Most vocabulary is derived from Latin, with substantial phonological and morphological changes throughout its history. Therefore, many words are shared with the other Romance languages,
Here the composition:
* Rhaetic and Celtic (9%) words are many, because the substrate of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Friuli, was the Rhaetic language and the Karn-Celtic language. (&quot;bâr&quot;, wood; &quot;clap/crap&quot;, stone;&quot;cjâr&quot;, plow)
* Modern German (10%) words were introduced in particular in the Middle Ages, during the Patrie dal Friûl, when the influence from this culture was quite strong (&quot;bearç&quot;, backyard; &quot;crot&quot;, frog/toad).
* Slavic (3%) words were brought by Slavic (mostly Alpine Slavic) immigrants called several times to Friuli to repopulate lands devastated by Hungarian invasions in the 10th century (, barn; , to shout). Furthermore, many Slavic words have entered Friulian through the centuries-long neighbouring between Friulians and Slovenes, especially in north-eastern Friuli (Slavia Friulana) and in the Gorizia and Gradisca area. Words such as &quot;colaç&quot; (cake), &quot;cudiç&quot; (devil) and &quot;cos&quot; (basket) are all of Slovene origin. There are also many toponyms with Slavic roots.
* There are many words that have Germanic (8%, probably Lombardic origins), Celtic and Rhaetic roots (what still remained of the languages spoken before the Romans came). Examples of the first category are &quot;sbregâ&quot;, to tear; &quot;sedon&quot;, spoon; &quot;taponâ&quot;, to cover. For the latter categories, &quot;troi&quot;, path; , trousers.
* Latin and derived languages (68%):
**Venetian language influenced Friulian vocabulary: , straw.
** Some French words entered the Friulian vocabulary: , really and &quot;gustâ&quot;, to have lunch.
** Italian itself has a growing influence on Friulian vocabulary, especially as far as neologisms are concerned (&quot;tren&quot; meaning train). Such neologisms are currently used even if they&#x27;re not accepted in the official dictionary (for example the verb &quot;to iron&quot; is &quot;sopressâ&quot; but the verb &quot;stirâ&quot; taken from Italian is used more and more instead).
* Scientific terms are often of Greek origin, and there are also some Arabic terms in Friulian (&lt;1%, &quot;lambic&quot;, still).
* Many English words (such as computer, monitor, mouse and so on) have entered the Friulian vocabulary through Italian. (more than 1%).

== Present condition ==
Nowadays, Friulian is officially recognized in Italy, supported by law 482/1999, which protects linguistic minorities. Therefore, optional teaching of Friulian has been introduced in many primary schools. An online newspaper is active, and there are also a number of musical groups singing in Friulian and some theatrical companies. Recently, two movies have been made in Friulian (&quot;Tierç lion&quot;, &quot;Lidrîs cuadrade di trê&quot;), with positive reviews in Italian newspapers. In about 40% of the communities in the Province of Udine, road signs are in both Friulian and Italian. There is also an official translation of the Bible. In 2005, a notable brand of beer used Friulian for one of its commercials.

The main association to foster the use and development of Friulian is the &quot;Societât filologjiche furlane&quot;, founded in Gorizia in 1919.

=== Toponyms ===
Every city and village in Friuli has two names, one in Italian and one in Friulian. Only the Italian is official and used in administration, but it is widely expected that the Friulian ones will receive partial acknowledgement in the near future. For example, the city of Udine is called &quot;Udin&quot; in Friulian, the town of Tolmezzo &quot;Tumieç&quot; and the town of Aviano is called both &quot;Davian&quot; and &quot;Pleif&quot;.

== Standardisation ==
A challenge that Friulian shares with other minority languages is to codify a standard variety and a suitable writing system. The regional law 15/1996 approved a standard orthography, which represents the basis of a common variant and should be used in toponyms, official acts, written documents. The standard is based on Central Friulian, which was traditionally the language used in literature already in 1700 and afterwards (the biggest examples are probably Pieri Çorut&#x27;s works) but with some changes:
* the diphthong &quot;ie&quot; replaces &quot;ia&quot;: &quot;fier (iron)&quot; instead of &quot;fiar&quot;, &quot;tiere (soil, earth)&quot; instead of &quot;tiare&quot;.
* the use of &quot;vu&quot; instead of &quot;u&quot; at the beginning of word: &quot;vueli (oil)&quot; instead of &quot;ueli &quot;, &quot;vueit (empty)&quot; instead of &quot;ueit&quot;.
* the use of &quot;i&quot; between vocals: &quot;ploie (rain)&quot; instead of &quot;ploe&quot;.

Standard Friulian is called in Friulian &quot;furlan standard&quot;, &quot;furlan normalizât&quot; or from Greek, &quot;coinè&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
There have been several critics of the standardisation of Friulian, mainly from speakers of local varieties that differ substantially from the proposed standard; they also argue that the standard could eventually kill local variants. The supporters of standardisation refer to the various advantages that a unique form can bring to the language. Above all, it can help to stop the influence of Italian language in the neologisms, which pose a serious threat to Friulian&#x27;s future development. They also point out that it is a written standard without affecting pronunciation, which can follow local variants.

Opponents of the standardisation, on the other hand, insist that the standard language, being artificially created, is totally inadequate to represent the local variations, particularly from differences in the phonetic pronunciation of the words in each variant that may, in some cases, even require special and different diacritics for writing a single variant.

=== Varieties of Friulian ===
At least four dialects of Friulian can be distinguished, all mutually intelligible. They are usually distinguished by the last vowel of many parts of speech (including nouns, adjectives, adverbs), following this scheme:
* Central Friulian, spoken around Udine has words ending with -e. It is used in official documents and generally considered standard. Some people see it as the least original but one of the most recent variants since it does not show interesting features found in other variants, as it has Venetian influence.
* Northern Friulian, spoken in Carnia, has several variants. The language can vary with the valleys and words can end in -o, -e or -a. It is the most archaic variant.
* Southeastern Friulian, spoken in Bassa Friulana and Eastern Friuli, in the area along the Isonzo River (the area of the old Contea di Gorizia e Gradisca), has words that end with -a. This variant has been known since the origins of the language and was used as official literary language by the Friulians of the Austrian Empire. It was influenced by German and Slavic.
* Western Friulian, including Pordenonese, is spoken in the Province of Pordenone and is also called , from Concordia Sagittaria. Words end with -a or -e, but the strong Venetian influence, makes it be considered one of the most corrupted variants.

The word for &quot;home&quot; is in Central Friulian and or in other areas. Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote his works in Western Friulian since he learned the language from his mother who was from Casarsa/Cjasarsa, near Pordenone.

In the 13th century, early literary works in Friulian were based on the language spoken in Cividale del Friuli, which was the most important town in Friuli. The endings in -o, which now is restricted to some villages in Carnia. Later, the main city of Friuli became Udine and the most common ending was -a; only from the 16th century on, -e endings were used in standard Friulian.

== Writing systems ==
In the official writing system, approved by the (former, abolished in 2017) Province of Udine and used in official documents, Friulian is written using the Latin script with the c-cedilla (ç). The letter q is used only for personal names and historical toponyms, and in every other case, it is replaced by c. Besides that, k, x, w, and y appear only in loan words so they are not considered part of the alphabet.
:Aa Bb Cc Çç Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Zz
There are also grave accents (à, è, ì, ò and ù) and circumflex accents (â, ê, î, ô, and û), which are put above the vowels to distinguish between homophonic words or to show stress (the former) and show long vowels (the latter).

=== Other systems ===
An alternative system is called Faggin-Nazzi from the names of the scholars who proposed it. It is less common, probably also because it is more difficult for a beginner for its use of letters, such as č, that are typical of Slavic languages but seem foreign to native Italian speakers.

<text>In distributed computing, an object request broker (ORB) is a concept of a middleware, which allows program calls to be made from one computer to another via a computer network, providing location transparency through remote procedure calls. ORBs promote interoperability of distributed object systems, enabling such systems to be built by piecing together objects from different vendors, while different parts communicate with each other via the ORB. Common Object Request Broker Architecture standardizes the way ORB may be implemented.

== Overview ==
ORBs assumed to handle the transformation of in-process data structures to and from the raw byte sequence, which is transmitted over the network. This is called marshalling or serialization. In addition to marshalling data, ORBs often expose many more features, such as distributed transactions, directory services or real-time scheduling. Some ORBs, such as CORBA-compliant systems, use an interface description language to describe the data that is to be transmitted on remote calls.

In object-oriented languages (e.g. Java), an ORB actually provides a framework which enables remote objects to be used over the network, in the same way as if they were local and part of the same process. On the client side, so-called &quot;stub&quot; objects are created and invoked, serving as the only part visible and used inside the client application. After the stub&#x27;s methods are invoked, the client-side ORB performs the marshalling of invocation data, and forwards the request to the server-side ORB. On the server side, ORB locates the targeted object, executes the requested operation, and returns the results. Having the results available, the client&#x27;s ORB performs the demarshalling and passes the results back into the invoked stub, making them available to the client application. The whole process is transparent, resulting in remote objects appearing as if they were local.

<doc id="317460" wikidata="Q536935" url="?curid=317460" title="West Berlin discotheque bombing">
<text>On 5 April 1986, three people were killed and 229 injured when La Belle discothèque was bombed in the Friedenau locality (then part of Schöneberg, and since 2001 part of the merged district of Tempelhof-Schöneberg) of West Berlin. The entertainment venue was commonly frequented by United States soldiers; two of the dead and 79 of the injured were Americans.

Libya was accused by the US government of sponsoring the bombing, before US president Ronald Reagan ordered retaliatory strikes on Tripoli and Benghazi in Libya ten days later. The operation was widely seen as an attempt to kill colonel Muammar Gaddafi. However, in the bombing&#x27;s aftermath, this claim was met with widespread skepticism. In 1987, Manfred Ganschow, the head of the West German team investigating the bombing, said that there was no evidence pointing towards Libya, a belief which was corroborated by numerous intelligence agencies in Europe at the time, according to a BBC report. In 2001, following a four-year German trial, often described as &quot;murky&quot; and marred by what the court called a &quot;limited willingness&quot; by the American and German governments to share evidence, it was found that the bombing had been &quot;planned by the Libyan Intelligence Service and the Libyan embassy&quot;, but absolved Gaddafi of responsibility.

==Background==

The bombing came at a time of heightened tension between the United States and Libya, which first escalated in the early 1980s. These tensions drastically escalated in early 1986, when US forces repeatedly flew planes over the Gulf of Sidra. Libyan forces subsequently fired upon American planes, which led to an American bombing campaign.

The site of the bombing, a discothèque known as &quot;La Belle&quot;, was known to be a popular spot for American troops in West Germany.

== Attack ==
A bomb placed under a table near the disc jockey&#x27;s booth exploded at 01:45 CET. An eyewitness testified that he had walked outside of the club prior to the bomb going off and the blast knocking him back. He righted himself and went inside to find his wife and joined many individuals who were attempting to help those near the blast.

The blast destroyed a large portion of the floor, causing many to fall into the cellar underneath the dance floor.

== Victims ==
The explosion instantly killed a Turkish woman, Nermin Hannay, and US Army Sergeant Kenneth T. Ford. A second American sergeant, James E. Goins, died from his injuries two months later.

The blast injured at least 230 individuals which included more than 50 American service members, as it was a popular hangout spot for service members. Some of the victims were left permanently disabled due to the injuries caused by the explosion.

==Blame and retribution==
Almost immediately after the bombing, the American government, led by then-president Ronald Reagan, placed the blame on Libya. However, the West German team investigating the bombing had not found any evidence of Libyan involvement, and other intelligence agencies throughout Europe also did not find evidence of Libyan involvement. Nine days after the bombing, Reagan ordered airstrikes against the Libyan capital of Tripoli, and city of Benghazi. At least 30 soldiers and 15 civilians were killed. Gaddafi&#x27;s adopted infant daughter Hana was reported killed, although the claim, and even her existence, have been disputed.

Following the reunification of Germany, archives from the Stasi in East Germany were made available, which led to Libyan embassy worker Musbah Eter, who would later be indicted for aiding and abetting attempted murder.

In 2001, a court in Germany found that the bombing had been &quot;planned by the Libyan secret service and the Libyan Embassy&quot;, and convicted four people suspected to be involved with the attack, including two workers at the Libyan embassy in East Germany. However, in their ruling, the court presiding over the trial complained that their decision was hindered by &quot;the limited willingness&quot; of the German and American governments to share intelligence, and the trial was called &quot;murky&quot; by BBC News. Notably, the trial failed to prove the involvement of then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.

==Trial and conviction==
In spite of reports blaming Libya for the attack on the nightclub, no individual was officially accused of the bombing until the 1990 reunification of Germany and the subsequent opening up of the Stasi archives. Stasi files led German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis to Musbah Abdulghasem Eter, a Libyan who had worked at the Libyan embassy in East Berlin. Stasi files listed him as an agent, and Mehlis said he was the Libyan spy agency&#x27;s main contact at the embassy.

Beginning in 1996, a number of suspects were extradited to Germany. Yasser Mohammed Chreidi, a Palestinian man accused of being the plot&#x27;s &quot;mastermind&quot;, was extradited from Lebanon to Germany on May 24 in connection with the bombing. Chreidi was said to be a &quot;suspected activist of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council&quot; headed by Abu Nidal, who used to live in Tripoli and was financed by Libya in the 1980s. Eter was reported to be the Libyan spy agency&#x27;s point man at the embassy in East Berlin.

Eter and four other suspects were arrested in 1996 in Lebanon, Italy, Greece, and Berlin, and put on trial a year later. Eventually, a four year trial in Germany, which ended in 2001, found that the bombing had been &quot;planned by the Libyan secret service and the Libyan Embassy&quot;, and convicted four people suspected to be involved with the attack: German citizen Verena Chanaa was found guilty of murder, after carrying a bag with the bomb used for the attack into &quot;La Belle&quot;; Yasir Shraydi, a Palestinian worker at the Libyan embassy in East Berlin, was convicted of attempted murder; Musbah Eter was found guilty of being an accomplice; Ali Chanaa, Verena Chanaa&#x27;s ex-husband, was also found guilty. A fifth defendant, Andrea Häusler, who accompanied Verena Chanaa to the club, was acquitted after prosecutors failed to prove she had known that the bomb used in the attack was in Chanaa&#x27;s bag. Verena Chanaa and Yasir Shraydi were sentenced to 14 years in prison, while Musbah Eter and Ali Chanaa were sentenced to 12 years.

The court found that the three men had assembled the bomb in the Chanaa&#x27;s flat. The explosive was said to have been brought into West Berlin in a Libyan diplomatic bag. The court also notably ruled that prosecutors failed to demonstrate involvement in the bombing by Muammar Gaddafi.

==Compensation==
On 17 August 2003, newspapers reported that Libya had signaled to the German government that it was ready to negotiate compensation for the bombing with lawyers for non-U.S. victims. A year later, on 10 August 2004, Libya concluded an agreement to pay a total of $35 million compensation to non-US citizens.

In October 2008, Libya paid $1.5 billion into a fund to compensate relatives of:
# Lockerbie bombing victims with the remaining 20% of the sum agreed in 2003;
# American victims of the West Berlin discotheque bombing;
# American victims of the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing; and,
# Libyan victims of the 1986 US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi.

<text>The BAE Systems Hawk is a British single-engine, jet-powered advanced trainer aircraft. It was first known as the Hawker Siddeley Hawk, and subsequently produced by its successor companies, British Aerospace and BAE Systems. It has been used in a training capacity and as a low-cost combat aircraft.

Operators of the Hawk include the Royal Air Force (notably the Red Arrows display team) and several foreign military operators. The Hawk was produced until 2020 in the UK, and continues to be produced under licence in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), with over 1000 Hawks sold to 18 operators around the world.

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1964, the Royal Air Force specified a requirement (Air Staff Target, AST, 362) for a new fast jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat. The SEPECAT Jaguar was originally intended for this role, but it was soon realised that it would be too complex an aircraft for fast jet training and only a small number of two-seat versions were purchased. Accordingly, in 1968, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) began studies for a simpler aircraft, initially as special project (SP) 117. The design team was led by Ralph Hooper.

This project was funded by the company as a private venture, in anticipation of possible RAF interest. The design was conceived of as having tandem seating and a combat capability in addition to training, as it was felt the latter would improve export sales potential. By the end of the year HSA had submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Defence based on the design concept, and in early 1970 the RAF issued Air Staff Target (AST) 397 which formalised the requirement for new trainers of this type. The RAF selected the HS.1182 for their requirement on 1 October 1971 and the principal contract, for 175 aircraft, was signed in March 1972.

The prototype aircraft XX154 first flew on 21 August 1974 from Dunsfold piloted by Duncan Simpson, Chief Test Pilot of HSA (Kingston), reaching 20,000 ft in a flight lasting 53 minutes. All development aircraft were built on production jigs; the program remained on time and to budget throughout. The Hawk T1 entered RAF service in late 1976. The first export Hawk 50 flew on 17 May 1976. This variant had been specifically designed for the dual role of lightweight fighter and advanced trainer; it had a greater weapons capacity than the T.1.
More variants of the Hawk followed, and common improvements to the base design typically included increased range, more powerful engines, redesigned wing and undercarriage, the addition of radar and forward-looking infrared, GPS navigation, and night-vision compatibility. Later models were manufactured with a great variety in terms of avionics fittings and system compatibility to suit the individual customer nation; cockpit functionality was often rearranged and programmed to be common to an operator&#x27;s main fighter fleet to increase the Hawk&#x27;s training value.

In 1981, a derivative of the Hawk was selected by the United States Navy as their new trainer aircraft. Designated the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the design was adapted to naval service and strengthened to withstand operating directly from the decks of carriers, in addition to typical land-based duties. This T-45 entered service in 1994; initial aircraft had analogue cockpits, while later deliveries featured a digital glass cockpit. All airframes were planned to undergo avionics upgrades to a common standard.

===Further development===
A major competitor to the Hawk for export sales has been the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet; aviation expert John W. R. Taylor commented: &quot;What Europe must avoid is the kind of wasteful competition that has the Hawker Siddeley Hawk and Dassault-Breguet/Dornier Alpha Jet battling against each other in the world market.&quot; By early 1998, a total of 734 Hawks had been sold, more than 550 of which had been sold to export customers. Military customers often procured the Hawk as a replacement for older aircraft such as the BAC Strikemaster, Hawker Hunter, and Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.

During the 1980s and 1990s, British Aerospace, the successor company to Hawker Siddeley, was trying to gain export sales of the variable-wing Panavia Tornado strike aircraft; however, countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, which had shown initial interest in the Tornado, concluded that the Hawk is a more suitable and preferable aircraft for their requirements. Malaysia and Oman cancelled their arranged Tornado orders in the early 1990s, both choosing to procure the Hawk, instead. Aviation authors Norman Polmar and Dana Bell stated of the Hawk: &quot;Of the many similar designs competing for a share of the world market, the Hawk has been without equal in performance as well as sales&quot;.
On 22 December 2004, the Ministry of Defence awarded a contract to BAE Systems to develop an advanced model of the Hawk for the RAF and Royal Navy. The Hawk Mk. 128, otherwise designated as Hawk T2, replaces conventional instrumentation with a glass cockpit, to better resemble modern fighter aircraft such as the new mainstay of the RAF, the Eurofighter Typhoon. In October 2006, a £450 million contract was signed for the production of 28 Hawk 128s. The aircraft&#x27;s maiden flight occurred on 27 July 2005 from BAE Systems&#x27; Warton Aerodrome.

According to BAE Systems, as of July 2012, they had sold nearly 1000 Hawks, with sales continuing. In July 2012, Australian Defence Minister Stephen Smith confirmed that Australia&#x27;s fleet of Hawk Mk 127s would be upgraded to a similar configuration to the RAF&#x27;s Hawk T2 as part of a major mid-life upgrade. The Hawk T2 was considered to be a competitor for the United States Air Force&#x27;s T-X program to acquire a new trainer fleet, but in February 2015, Northrop Grumman determined the Hawk&#x27;s shortfalls made it ill-suited for the program requirements and dropped it as their offering.

In May 2015, Indian aerospace manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) revealed that it was examining the prospects of performing its own Hawk upgrades, including armed light attack variants. The Indian Air Force, which were in the process of receiving trainer Hawks built under licence by HAL, were reportedly interested in the upgrade proposals, which would also include avionics and cockpit modifications; HAL has stated that it also aims to export combat Hawks to other countries in partnership with BAE. Missile developer and manufacturer MBDA may provide their ASRAAM and Brimstone missiles to arm the new attack type.
==Design==
 The Hawk is an advanced 2-seat trainer with a tandem cockpit, a low-mounted cantilever wing and is powered by a single turbofan engine. The design team was led by Ralph Hooper. Unlike many of the previous trainers in RAF service, the Hawk was specifically designed for training. Hawker had developed the aircraft to have a high level of serviceability, as well as lower purchasing and operating costs than previous trainers like the Jet Provost. The Hawk has been praised by pilots for its agility, in particular its roll and turn handling.

The design of the fuselage included a height differential between the two seats of the cockpit; this provided generous levels of visibility for the instructor in the rear seat. Each cockpit is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mk 10B zero-zero rocket-assisted ejection seat. Air is fed to the aircraft&#x27;s rear-mounted Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour engine via intakes on each of the forward wing roots. During the aircraft&#x27;s development, Hawker had worked closely with Rolls-Royce to reduce the engine&#x27;s fuel consumption and to ensure a high level of reliability.

Even within the development stages, a Hawk variant was intended to also serve as a single-seat ground-attack fighter; both the trainer and fighter models were developed with the export market in mind. On single seat models, the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, multi-mode radar, laser rangefinder and forward-looking infrared (FLIR). Some export customers, such as Malaysia, have extensive modifications to their aircraft, including the addition of wingtip hardpoint stations and a fittable inflight refuelling probe.
The Hawk was designed to be manoeuvrable and can reach Mach 0.88 in level flight and Mach 1.15 in a dive, thus allowing trainees to experience transonic flight before advancing to a supersonic trainer. The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9 g; the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4 g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft&#x27;s flaps, airbrakes and landing gear, together with the flight controls. A ram air turbine is fitted in front of the single tail fin to provide backup hydraulic power for the flight controls in the event of an engine failure; additionally, a gas turbine auxiliary power unit is housed directly above the engine.

The Hawk is designed to carry a centreline gun pod, such as the 30 mm ADEN cannon, two under-wing pylons, and up to four hardpoints for fitting armaments and equipment. In RAF service, Hawks have been equipped to operate the Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the early 1990s, British Aerospace investigated the possibility of arming the Hawk with the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile for export customers. In 2016, BAE Systems was developing the so-called &#x27;Advanced Hawk&#x27; with a new wing using leading-edge slats, and potentially additional sensors and weapons, a head-mounted display, and a single large-screen display in the forward cockpit.
==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===
The Hawk entered RAF service in April 1976, replacing the Folland Gnat and Hawker Hunter for advanced training and weapons training. The &quot;Hawk T1&quot; was the original version used by the RAF, deliveries commencing in November 1976. The most famous users of the Hawk are the Red Arrows aerobatic team, who adopted the plane in 1979.

From 1983 to 1986, some Hawks were equipped as short-range interceptor aircraft. 88 T1s were modified to carry two AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles in addition to a 30 mm ADEN cannon gun pod; these aircraft were redesignated as &quot;Hawk T1A&quot;. In a wartime scenario, they would have worked in collaboration with the RAF&#x27;s Tornado F3 interceptors, which would use their Foxhunter search radars and more sophisticated navigation systems to vector the Hawks against enemy targets.
The Hawk subsequently replaced the English Electric Canberra for target towing duties. The Royal Navy acquired a dozen Hawk T1/1As from the RAF; these are typically operated in a support role, often to conduct simulated combat training on board ships.

During the 1990s and 2000s, 80 Hawk T1/1A aircraft were upgraded under the Fuselage Replacement Programme (FRP) to extend their operational lifespan; sections of the centre and rear fuselage sections were entirely replaced. In 2009, the RAF began receiving the first Hawk T2, in the long term, T2 aircraft will replace the ageing T1s. Training operations on the Hawk T2 began in April 2012.

In August 2011, a Red Arrows pilot was killed when his Hawk T1 crashed following a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival; the inquest found &quot;G-force impairment&quot; may have caused the pilot to lose control. The Hawk T1 fleet was grounded as a precautionary measure and returned to flight status a few days later. 
In November 2011, the Red Arrows suffered another pilot fatality when the Martin-Baker Mk.10 ejection seat fitted to the Hawk T1 activated while the aircraft was stationary; the veteran combat pilot died on ground impact when the ejector seat parachute also failed to deploy. This resulted in the UK Ministry of Defence implementing a ban on non-essential flying in aircraft fitted with ejector seats similar to those fitted in the Hawk T1 after the death. The ban was lifted for Tornado attack jets but remained on Hawk T1, Hawk T2 and Tucano flights while the RAF reviewed evidence on those aircraft.

In October 2017, the RAF and Royal Navy operated 75 Hawk T1 and 28 Hawk T2. According to the Ministry of Defence, the planned out-of-service date for the Hawk T1 was 2030, with the aircraft selected to meet the requirements of the Air Support to Defence Operational Training (ASDOT) programme beginning to replace the Hawk from 2027. However, in July 2021, it was announced that all UK military units operating the Hawk T1 aircraft, apart from the Red Arrows, would see their airframes retired by 31 March 2022.

===Canada===
In Canada, the Hawk – designated as the CT-155 Hawk – was used to train pilots for front-line fighter aircraft. The aircraft was operated under the NATO Flying Training in Canada (NFTC) program, which was provided by the Military Aviation Training division of Bombardier Aerospace but transferred to CAE by acquisition in 2015. 

All CT-155 were retired in March 2024 without a replacement. 

===Finland===

In January 1978, Britain and Finland announced a deal in which the Finnish Air Force was to receive 50 Hawk Mk. 51s in 1980; these aircraft were built in Finland under licence by Valmet. The Finnish Air Force was limited to 60 first-line fighter aircraft by the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947; by acquiring Hawks, which counted as trainers rather than fighters, capacity could be increased while continuing treaty compliance. These conditions were nullified during the 1990s by the break-up of the Soviet Union.

Seven additional Mk. 51As were delivered in 1993–94 to make up for losses. In June 2007, Finland arranged to purchase 18 used Hawk Mk. 66s from the Swiss Air Force for 41 million euros; they were delivered in 2009–2010. Finnish Hawks have reportedly been armed with Soviet Molniya R-60/AA-8 as well as with AIM-9J and AIM-9M air-to-air missiles, Matra Type 155 SNEB rocket pods, unspecified British general-purpose bombs of multiple types, VKT 12.7 mm machine gun pods and Royal Small Arms Factory 30 mm ADEN autocannon pods. The Finnish Air Force aerobatics team, the Midnight Hawks, also uses the aircraft.

Due to rising levels of metal fatigue, a major structural reinforcement program was carried out to extend the operational life of Finland&#x27;s Hawks during the 1990s. Due to lifespan limitations, 41 out of 67 in Finland&#x27;s total Hawk fleet were taken out of service between 2012 and 2016; the remaining aircraft are younger and thus are expected to be flying into the 2030s. In 2011, Finnish Mk. 51s and Mk. 66s underwent a series of upgrades performed by Patria, these included the adoption of a new &quot;Cockpit 4000&quot; glass cockpit, new software, and other life-extending modifications. This upgrade program was completed in 2013.

===India===
On 23 February 2008, the Hawk Mk. 132 formally entered service with the Indian Air Force (IAF), after one of the most protracted procurements in India&#x27;s history, two decades having elapsed between the initial interest and the contract signing on 26 March 2004. The IAF received 24 aircraft directly from BAE Systems with deliveries beginning in November 2007, and further 42 Hawks assembled by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited between 2008 and 2011. In February 2008, India planned to order 57 more Hawks, with 40 going to the Indian Air Force and the remaining 17 to the Indian Navy.

In July 2010, it was announced that the IAF and the Navy would receive the additional 57 aircraft. The additional aircraft will be all built in India by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), continuing to work under licence from BAE. On 10 February 2011, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and GE Aviation signed a contract under which GE Aviation will conduct the next 30 years of maintenance on the Hawk fleet. In 2011, the IAF was reportedly unhappy with the provision of spare components; In December 2011, BAE received a contract to provide India with spares and ground support.

The first IAF Hawk AJT crashed on 29 April 2008 at 406 Air Force Station Bidar, Karnataka. On 3 June 2015, another Hawk AJT aircraft crashed near Baharagora, close to the West Bengal – Odisha border.

The Hawk fleet is based at IAF&#x27;s Bidar Air Force Station in north Karnataka, about 700 km from Bangalore. As of 2015, a total of 123 aircraft were on order by the Indian Air Force and 17 by the Indian Navy, with an additional order of 20 aircraft were under negotiation.

===Indonesia===
In April 1978, Indonesia, seeking to increase its aerial capabilities, placed the first of multiple orders for the Hawk. The Indonesian Air Force received more than 40 Hawks in the 1980s and 1990s; In June 1991, BAe and Indonesian Aerospace (IPTN) signed a major agreement for collaborative production of the Hawk, and more orders of the Hawk were anticipated. Further Hawk exports were eventually blocked due to concerns over Indonesian human rights, particularly in East Timor. During the 1990s protests erupted across England over arming Indonesia and pressure increased after the mass-murder of the Balibo Five journalists and Roger East came to light and allegations of the use of Hawks during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor.

The Hawks have been the backbone of Indonesian Air Force, supplementing more advanced and expensive aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon. In September 2013, the Indonesian Air Force began receiving the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle, which has been reported as having been set to eventually replace the Hawk in service. In February 2016, it was announced that Indonesia&#x27;s Hawk fleet was set to receive a new radar warning receiver self-defense system, aiding the type&#x27;s use in light attack operations.

A BAE Hawk in use with the Indonesian Air Force crashed on 15 June 2020.

===Malaysia===
The Royal Malaysian Air Force has 18 Hawk aircraft, consisting of 4 Hawk 108 export versions as training aircraft and 14 Hawk 208 as combat aircraft. On 5 March 2013, during the 2013 Lahad Datu standoff, five Hawk 208 together with three American-made Boeing F/A-18D Hornets were employed in airstrikes on hideouts of the terrorist group Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo in Lahad Datu, Sabah ahead of the ground assault by joint forces of the Malaysian Army and Royal Malaysian Police.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia acquired the Hawk under the Al-Yamamah arms deal with Britain, with a total of 50 Hawk Mk. 65/65As ordered in contracts placed in 1985 and 1994 respectively. In August 2012, a deal for 22 Hawk &#x27;Advanced Jet Trainers&#x27; worth approximately $800 million was announced. The AJTs would replace older models of Hawks in the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) inventory. The Hawk is flown by the RSAF demonstration team. In February 2016 it emerged that Saudi Arabia had doubled the number of Hawk AJT aircraft it had ordered from BAE Systems, with an order for a further 22. This was revealed in the company&#x27;s preliminary annual report for 2015; &quot;We reached agreement with the Saudi customer for the provision of a further 22 Hawk AJT aircraft, associated ground equipment, and training aids for the RSAF which form part of an enhancement to the Kingdom&#x27;s training capacity.&quot; Once in service, the Hawk AJTs will complete the replacement of the earlier Mk 65 and Mk 65A platforms. 22 of these Hawks are to be assembled locally in Saudi Arabia, the first of which was completed in March 2019.

===Zimbabwe===
In the 1980s, 12 BAE Hawk T.Mk. 60/60As were purchased for the Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ); the purchase was supported by a £35 million loan from the UK to Zimbabwe. The Hawk deal also included the transfer of a number of used Hawker Hunters. In July 1982, at least one Hawk was destroyed on the ground and three more heavily damaged during a dissident attack on Thornhill air base, Gweru.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s Hawks were used during the Second Congo War. Numerous airstrikes were conducted in support of the Congolese Army against Rwandan, Ugandan and rebel forces in 1998–2000. Alongside other aircraft, AFZ Hawks played a significant role in the defence of Kinshasa during the early days of the war. In 2000, the controversy over Zimbabwe&#x27;s military intervention in the Congo and poor human rights record led to Britain imposing a total arms embargo on the nation, including spare parts for the Hawk. Due to the embargo, Zimbabwe has purchased six Chinese Hongdu K-8s as a substitute.

An unknown number of Zimbabwe&#x27;s Hawks were restored to service in 2022; Zimbabwean military officials declined to comment on the details of their refurbishment.

===Others===
During the 1980s, a prospective sale of 63 Hawk trainers to Iraq was considered by the British government. While the proposal had its proponents, it was controversial as in a ground-attack capacity Iraq might have employed the Hawk against neighbouring Iran and to oppress Iraq&#x27;s own Kurdish population; there was also concern that the Hawk could be potentially armed with chemical weapons. After considerable deliberation the sale was blocked by then Foreign Secretary John Major. In 2010, Iraq entered talks with BAE for an order of up to 21 Hawks.

In 1993, talks between BAe and South Africa&#x27;s Denel Aviation began regarding a replacement for the South African Air Force (SAAF)&#x27;s ageing Atlas Impala fleet. By 2004, Denel had begun construction of Hawks under licence from BAe; components for other customers have also been produced by Denel. On 13 January 2005, the first locally assembled Hawk conducted its first flight; it belonged to a batch of 24 trainers ordered by the SAAF.

==Variants==

===Hawk T1===
The Hawker Siddeley Hawk T1 (Trainer Mark 1) was the original version of the Hawk used by the RAF, deliveries commencing in November 1976. The RAF received a total of 175 T1s.

===Hawk T1A===
The British Aerospace Hawk T1A is a modified Hawk T1, intended to replace the Hawker Hunter in the RAF&#x27;s Tactical Weapons Units. A total of 89 aircraft were converted to carry two underwing AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles and a centreline Aden gun pod. This is also the variant used by the RAF&#x27;s Red Arrows display team; the underbody gun pod is replaced by a fairing used to carry diesel fuel and dye for the display smoke system.

===Hawk 50===
The Hawk 50 was the original export trainer version, and offered a limited attack capability. Finland, Indonesia and Kenya ordered 90 of this variant.

===Hawk 120/LIFT===
The Hawk Lead-in Fighter Trainer (LIFT) is the version selected by the South African Air Force in December 1999. This variant is powered by the Adour 951. The LIFT benefits from development carried out for the Australian Mk. 127.

The next generation Hawks (120, 127 and 128) feature a new wing, forward and centre fuselage, fin and tailplane. The aircraft have only 10% commonality with the existing first generation aircraft. The new variants also have four times the fatigue life of the original aircraft. 24 aircraft will be delivered.

===Hawk 127===
The Royal Australian Air Force ordered 33 Hawk 127 Lead-in Fighters (LIFs) in June 1997, 12 of which were produced in the UK and 21 in Australia. This variant is also powered by the Adour 871. The Hawk 127 is operated by the RAAF&#x27;s No. 76 Squadron and No. 79 Squadron which are based at RAAF Base Williamtown and RAAF Base Pearce respectively. Work to upgrade the RAAF&#x27;s Hawks to a standard similar to the Hawk 128 standard began in 2014, and it is planned that the two squadrons will begin operations with these aircraft in 2017.

===Hawk AJT===
The BAE Systems Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) differs from previous variants in that it features modern LCDs instead of conventional instrumentation and is powered by the Rolls-Royce Adour 951 engine. In 2012, orders were placed for the AJT version by the Royal Saudi Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Oman.
*Hawk 128 (Hawk T2) – Version for the RAF and Royal Navy. The Ministry of Defence awarded a Design and Development Contract to BAE Systems on 22 December 2004. The T2 builds on the design of the Australian Mk. 127 and the South African Mk. 120s.
*Hawk 132 – Export version for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and was previously known as the Mk. 115Y. BAE Systems delivered the final of 24 UK-built Hawks to the IAF in November 2009. HAL handed over the first locally-built Hawk 132 on 14 August 2008. These aircraft are powered by the Rolls-Royce Adour Mk 871 engine. The variant is also used by the Indian Navy&#x27;s INAS 551.
*Hawk 165 – Export version for the Royal Saudi Air Force. 22 aircraft were originally built in the UK by BAE with delivery completed in 2017, whilst another 22 aircraft are currently being built locally in Saudi Arabia with the first &quot;locally built&quot; aircraft delivered to the RSAF in June 2019 and a further 7 by October 2019. The last locally assembled Hawk mk.165 was formally handed over in February 2024 during the World Defense Show (WDS) in Riyadh.
*Hawk 166 – Export version for the Royal Air Force of Oman. 8 aircraft were ordered in 2012 and built in the UK, with the first aircraft delivered in 2017.
*Hawk 167 – Export version for the Qatar Emiri Air Force (QEAF). 9 aircraft were ordered in 2018, with the first aircraft delivered in September 2021. The aircraft are based at RAF Leeming to operate with the RAF on the Joint RAF/QEAF AJT Training Squadron.

===Hawk 200===
The Hawk 200 is a single-seat, lightweight multi-role combat aircraft for air defence, air-denial, anti-shipping, interdiction, close air support, and ground attack.

*Hawk 203 – Export version for the Royal Air Force of Oman. (12)
*Hawk 205 – Proposed export version for the Royal Saudi Air Force.
*Hawk 208 – Export version for the Royal Malaysian Air Force. (18)
*Hawk 209 – Export version for the Indonesian Air Force. (32)

===T-45 Goshawk===
The T-45 Goshawk is a carrier-capable aircraft developed from the Hawk 60 for the United States Navy for use in aircraft carrier training.

===Advanced Hawk (Hawk-i)===
The Advanced Hawk is a joint venture by BAE Systems and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to upgrade IAF&#x27;s existing Hawk 132 AJT into an Advanced Transonic Fighter-trainer, which can be used in Main Battlefields. A single prototype of the aircraft was unveiled at the Aero India 2017, in Bangalore, from 14-18 February 2017. It made its first flight with the IAF in June 2017.

<text>Fierljeppen (West Frisian compound of &quot;fier&quot;—&quot;far&quot; and &quot;ljeppen&quot;—&quot;leaping&quot;) or polsstokverspringen is a traditional sport of the Netherlands, and of West Frisian people in the Dutch province of Fryslân. The sport is also traditionally popular in the province of Utrecht which produced record holder Jaco de Groot and Theo van Kooten.

==Description==
The sport involves a long pole and a body of water. The pole is between long and has a flat round plate at the bottom to prevent it from sinking into the muddy river or canal bottom.

A jump consists of a sprint to the pole (polsstok), jumping and grabbing it, then climbing to the top of the pole while trying to control its forward and lateral movements over a body of water, and finishing by landing on a sand bed opposite to the starting point.

==History==
The Netherlands has many waterways. Fierljeppen originated as a way for Frisian people to get around the waterways easily. Over time it turned into a competition with the first official match in 1771 but the sport was not properly structured until 1957.
The sport is believed to have originated with farmers who used poles to leap over small water drainage channels to access different plots of land. In the German region of East Frisia this sport is known as &quot;Pultstockspringen&quot;. Today the sport is primarily practiced for fun or to entertain tourists, but there still is an official annual &quot;National Fierljepping Manifestation&quot; (NFM) in the Netherlands, and championships are contested in six leagues and numerous clubs.

==Record holders==
The current Dutch record holders by category are:
*Seniors: , Jaco de Groot from Woerden, Utrecht (12 August 2017, Zegveld)
*Veterans: , Theo van Kooten from Haastrecht, South Holland (31 July 2013, Linschoten)
*Ladies: Marrit van der Wal from It Heidenskip, Friesland (31 July 2019, Burgum)
*Juniors (under 20): , Reinier Overbeek from Benschop, Utrecht (19 August 2019, Burgum)
*Boys (under 16): , Wisse Broekstra from Winsum, Friesland (19 September 2020, Burgum)
*Girls (under 16): , Hanneke Westert from IJlst, Friesland (24 August 2022, Burgum)

There are 532 registered active jumpers in the world; of those, 190 are from the Netherlands.

==Fierljeppen throughout the world==
International tourists who have visited Friesland and or the Lek -regions and who have observed this sport have helped to spread its popularity across the globe. Competitions in other locales now take place, albeit at a less competitive level due to smaller numbers of athletes and the lack of suitable locations.

Many Americans were first introduced to the sport, referred to as &quot;ditch-vaulting&quot;, on the twelfth season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. This same task would be performed in the twenty-first and thirty-first seasons as a &quot;Switchback&quot; task.

<text>Inferences are steps in logical reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word &quot;&quot; means to &quot;carry forward&quot;. Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into deduction and induction, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. Induction is inference from particular evidence to a universal conclusion. A third type of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, contradistinguishing abduction from induction.

Various fields study how inference is done in practice. Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the fields of logic, argumentation studies, and cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference. Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

==Definition==
The process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called inductive reasoning. The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations. Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.

This definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: &quot;induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances.&quot; ) The definition given thus applies only when the &quot;conclusion&quot; is general.

Two possible definitions of &quot;inference&quot; are:
# A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
# The process of reaching such a conclusion.

==Examples==
===Example for definition #1===
Ancient Greek philosophers defined a number of syllogisms, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:
# All humans are mortal.
# All Greeks are humans.
# All Greeks are mortal.

The reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?

The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word &quot;valid&quot; does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference. An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true. But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.

For example, consider the form of the following symbological track:
#All meat comes from animals.
#All beef is meat.
#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.

If the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.

Now we turn to an invalid form.
#All A are B.
#All C are B.
#Therefore, all C are A.

To show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.
#All apples are fruit. (True)
#All bananas are fruit. (True)
#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)

A valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):
#All tall people are French. (False)
#John Lennon was tall. (True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)

When a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.

A valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:
#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)
#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)

In this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.

===Example for definition #2===

Evidence: It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the Soviet Union. You read in the Moscow newspaper that a soccer team from a small city in Siberia starts winning game after game. The team even defeats the Moscow team. Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore. The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.

Knowns: The Soviet Union is a command economy: people and material are told where to go and what to do. The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.

Explanation: In a command economy, people and material are moved where they are needed. Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (possibly due to sunnier weather and better facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better. In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs. It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team. The anomaly indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small. Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere? To hide them, of course.

==Incorrect inference==
An incorrect inference is known as a fallacy. Philosophers who study informal logic have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many biases in human reasoning that favor incorrect reasoning.

==Applications==

===Inference engines===
AI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of expert systems and later business rule engines. More recent work on automated theorem proving has had a stronger
basis in formal logic.

An inference system&#x27;s job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are relevant to its task.

Additionally, the term &#x27;inference&#x27; has also been applied to the process of generating predictions from trained neural networks. In this context, an &#x27;inference engine&#x27; refers to the system or hardware performing these operations. This type of inference is widely used in applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing.

====Prolog engine====
Prolog (for &quot;Programming in Logic&quot;) is a programming language based on a subset of predicate calculus. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called backward chaining.

Let us return to our Socrates syllogism. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:

 mortal(X) :- man(X).
 man(socrates). 
( Here :- can be read as &quot;if&quot;. Generally, if &quot;P Q&quot; (if P then Q) then in Prolog we would code &quot;Q:-P&quot; (Q if P).)
This states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:

 ?- mortal(socrates).
(where &quot;?-&quot; signifies a query: Can &quot;mortal(socrates).&quot; be deduced from the KB using the rules)
gives the answer &quot;Yes&quot;.

On the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:

 ?- mortal(plato).

gives the answer &quot;No&quot;.

This is because Prolog does not know anything about Plato, and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called closed world assumption). Finally
?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in &quot;Yes&quot; (and in some implementations: &quot;Yes&quot;: X=socrates)
Prolog can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.

===Semantic web===
Recently automatic reasoners found in semantic web a new field of application. Being based upon description logic, knowledge expressed using one variant of OWL can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.

===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===
Philosophers and scientists who follow the Bayesian framework for inference use the mathematical rules of probability to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability &quot;probability logic&quot;, following E. T. Jaynes).

Bayesians identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that &quot;it&#x27;s going to rain tomorrow&quot; has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.

Through the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see Bayesian decision theory). A central rule of Bayesian inference is Bayes&#x27; theorem.

===Fuzzy logic===

=== Non-monotonic logic ===

A relation of inference is monotonic if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is non-monotonic.
Deductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.

By contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.
We know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce&#x27;s theory of abduction, inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.

<text>A homunculus ( , , ; &quot;little person&quot;, : homunculi , , ) is a small human being. Popularized in 16th-century alchemy and 19th-century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. The concept has roots in preformationism as well as earlier folklore and alchemic traditions.

The term lends its name to the cortical homunculus, an image of a person with the size of the body parts distorted to represent how much area of the cerebral cortex of the brain is devoted to it.

== History ==

=== Alchemy ===

During medieval and early modern times, it was thought that homunculus, an artificial humanlike being, could be created through alchemy. The homunculus first appears by name in alchemical writings attributed to Paracelsus (1493–1541). &quot;De natura rerum&quot; (1537) outlines his method for creating homunculi:

The fully grown homunculus was supposedly greatly skilled in &quot;art&quot; and can create giants, dwarves, and other marvels, as &quot;Through art they are born, and therefore art is embodied and inborn in them, and they need learn it from no one.&quot;

Comparisons have been made with several similar concepts in the writings of earlier alchemists. Although the actual word &quot;homunculus&quot; was never used, Carl Jung believed that the concept first appeared in the &quot;Visions of Zosimos&quot;, written in the third century AD. In the visions, Zosimos encounters a priest who changes into &quot;the opposite of himself, into a mutilated &quot;anthroparion&quot;&quot;. The Greek word &quot;anthroparion&quot; is similar to &quot;homunculus&quot; – a diminutive form of &quot;person&quot;. Zosimos subsequently encounters other anthroparia in his dream but there is no mention of the creation of artificial life. In his commentary, Jung equates the homunculus with the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, and the &quot;inner person&quot; in parallel with Christ.

In Islamic alchemy, &quot;takwin&quot; () was a goal of certain Muslim alchemists, and is frequently found in writings of the Jabirian corpus. In the alchemical context, &quot;takwin&quot; refers to the artificial creation of life, spanning the full range of the chain of being, from minerals to prophets, imitating the function of the demiurge. One set of instructions for creating animal life found within the Jabirian &quot;Kitab al-Tajmi&quot; involves finding a vessel shaped like the animal and combining the animal&#x27;s bodily fluids within it, then placing the vessel at the center of a model of a celestial sphere as heat is applied to it. Some of the alchemists believed that these methods originated somewhere in India or Southeast Asia.

The homunculus continued to appear in alchemical writings after Paracelsus&#x27; time. The &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot; (1616) for example, concludes with the creation of a male and female form identified as &quot;Homunculi duo&quot;. The allegorical text suggests to the reader that the ultimate goal of alchemy is not chrysopoeia, but it is instead the artificial generation of humans. Here, the creation of homunculi symbolically represents spiritual regeneration and Christian soteriology.

In 1775, Count Johann Ferdinand von Kufstein, together with Abbé Geloni, an Italian cleric, is reputed to have created ten homunculi with the ability to foresee the future, which von Kufstein kept in glass containers at his Masonic lodge in Vienna. Dr. Emil Besetzny&#x27;s Masonic handbook, &quot;Die Sphinx&quot;, devoted an entire chapter to the &quot;wahrsagenden Geister&quot; (scrying ghosts). These are reputed to have been seen by several people, including local dignitaries.

===Folklore===
References to the homunculus do not appear prior to sixteenth-century alchemical writings but alchemists may have been influenced by earlier folk traditions. The mandragora, known in German as &quot;Alreona&quot;, &quot;Alraun&quot; or &quot;Alraune&quot; is one example; Jean-Baptiste Pitois&#x27;s &quot;The History and Practice of Magic&quot; makes a direct comparison to the mandragora in one excerpt:

The homunculus has also been compared to the golem of Jewish folklore. Though the specifics outlining the creation of the golem and homunculus are very different, the concepts both metaphorically relate man to the divine, in his construction of life in his own image.

===Preformationism===
Preformationism is the formerly popular theory that animals developed from miniature versions of themselves. Sperm cells were believed to contain complete preformed individuals called &quot;animalcules&quot;. Development was therefore a matter of enlarging this into a fully formed being. The term homunculus was later used in the discussion of conception and birth.

Nicolas Hartsoeker postulated the existence of animalcules in the semen of humans and other animals. This was the beginning of spermists&#x27; theory, which held that the sperm was in fact a &quot;little man&quot; that was placed inside a woman for growth into a child, an effective explanation for many of the mysteries of conception. It was later pointed out that if the sperm was a homunculus, identical in all but size to an adult, then the homunculus may have sperm of its own. This led to a &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; with a chain of homunculi &quot;all the way down&quot;, an idea also known as the homunculus fallacy. This was not necessarily considered by spermists a fatal objection, however, as it neatly explained the Genesis creation narrative&#x27;s claim that it was &quot;in Adam&quot; that all had sinned: the whole of humanity was already contained in his loins during the original sin. The spermists&#x27; theory also failed to explain why children tend to resemble their mothers as well as their fathers, though some spermists suggested that the growing homunculus assimilated maternal characteristics from the womb.

==Terminological use in modern science==

The homunculus is commonly used today in scientific disciplines such as psychology as a teaching or memory tool to describe the distorted scale model of a human drawn or sculpted to reflect the relative space human body parts occupy on the somatosensory cortex (the sensory homunculus) and the motor cortex (the motor homunculus). Both the motor and sensory homunculi usually appear as small men superimposed over the top of precentral or postcentral gyri for motor and sensory cortices, respectively. The homunculus is oriented with feet medial and shoulders lateral on top of both the precentral and the postcentral gyrus (for both motor and sensory). The man&#x27;s head is depicted upside down in relation to the rest of the body such that the forehead is closest to the shoulders. The lips, hands, feet and sex organs have more sensory neurons than other parts of the body, so the homunculus has correspondingly large lips, hands, feet, and genitals. The motor homunculus is very similar to the sensory homunculus, but differs in several ways. Specifically, the motor homunculus has a portion for the tongue most lateral while the sensory homunculus has an area for genitalia most medial and an area for visceral organs most lateral. Well known in the field of neurology, this is also commonly called &quot;the little man inside the brain&quot;. This scientific model is known as the cortical homunculus.

In medical science, the term homunculus is sometimes applied to certain fetus-like ovarian cystic teratomae. These will sometimes contain hair, sebaceous material and in some cases cartilaginous or bony structures.

In a recent article published in the peer-reviewed journal Leonardo &quot;The Missing Female Homunculus” by Haven Wright and Preston Foerder revisits the history of the Homunculus, sheds light on current research in neuroscience on the female brain, and reveals what they believe to be the first sculpture of the female Homunculus, done by the artist and first author Haven Wright, based on the current research available.

==In popular culture==
===Early literature===

Homunculi can be found in centuries worth of literature. These fictions are primarily centred around imaginative speculations on the quest for artificial life associated with Paracelsian alchemy. One of the very earliest literary references occurs in Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643), in which the author states:

The fable of the alchemically-created homunculus may have been central in Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818). Professor Radu Florescu suggests that Johann Konrad Dippel, an alchemist born in Frankenstein Castle, might have been the inspiration for Victor Frankenstein. German playwright Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot; (1832) famously features an alchemically-created homunculus. Here, the character of Homunculus embodies the quest of a pure spirit to be born into a mortal form, contrasting Faust&#x27;s desire to shed his mortal body to become pure spirit. The alchemical idea that the soul is not imprisoned in the body, but instead may find its brightest state as it passes through the material plane, is central to the character.
William Makepeace Thackeray wrote under the pen name of Homunculus.

===Contemporary literature===
The homunculus legend, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot; have continued to influence works in the twentieth and twenty-first century. The theme has been used not only in fantasy literature, but also to illuminate social topics. For instance, the British children&#x27;s writers Mary Norton and Rumer Godden used homunculus motifs in their work, expressing various post-war anxieties about refugees, persecution of minorities in war, and the adaptation of these minorities to a &quot;big&quot; world. W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1908 novel &quot;The Magician&quot; utilises the concept of the homunculus as an important plot element. David H. Keller&#x27;s short story &quot;A Twentieth-Century Homunculus&quot; (1930) describes the creation of homunculi on an industrial scale by a pair of misogynists. Likewise, Sven Delblanc&#x27;s &quot;The Homunculus: A Magic Tale&quot; (1965) addresses alleged misogyny and the Cold War industrial-military complexes of the Soviet Union and NATO. In German children&#x27;s author Cornelia Funke&#x27;s book, &quot;Dragon Rider&quot;, the protagonists meet and are aided by a homunculus created by an alchemist. The homunculus, and alchemy broadly, is seen as more of a magical phenomenon in the story, however, rather than necessarily having a symbolic meaning.

===Other media===
Homunculi appear in fantasy based television, film, and games in a manner consistent with literature. Examples can be found in numerous media, such as the podcast &quot;Hello From The Magic Tavern,&quot; the films &quot;Homunculus&quot; (1916), &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935), &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973), &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (1977), the made-for-television movie &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot; (1973) and its theatrical remake (2011), &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999), Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Backbone&quot; (2001), Shane Acker&#x27;s &quot;9&quot; (2009), Philipp Humm&#x27;s &quot;The Last Faust&quot; (2019), Yorgos Lanthimos&#x27; &quot;Poor Things&quot; (2023), television shows (such as &quot;Bloodfeast&quot;, &quot;American Dad&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (season 2, episode 1) (2015), &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; (season 1, episode 5) (season 2, episode 5), and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; ((season 3, episode 3), played by Johnny Galecki), fantasy role-playing games (such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;), video games (such as &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;, &quot;Valkyrie Profile&quot;, &quot; Shadow of Memories&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, &quot;Bayonetta 3&quot;, and &quot;Master Detective Archives: Rain Code&quot;), books (such as &quot;The Secret Series&quot; and &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot; or &quot;Seventy-Two Letters&quot; by Ted Chiang), graphic novels (such as &quot;Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense&quot;) and manga (such as &quot;Akihabara Dennō Gumi&quot;, &quot;Homunculus&quot;, &quot;Stone Ocean&quot;, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Sorcerous Stabber Orphen&quot;, &quot;Fate/Zero&quot;, and &quot;Gosick&quot;).

<text>The &#x27; – PSL (; also known as ENS, &#x27;, Ulm or ENS Paris) is a &quot;grande école&quot; in Paris, France. It is one of the constituent members of Paris Sciences et Lettres University (PSL). Its pupils, predominantly postgraduate students, generally have considerable freedom to structure their own curriculum and learning. Its pupils are generally referred to as &quot;normaliens&quot;, while its alumni are generally referred to as &quot;archicubes&quot;.

The school was founded in 1794 during the French Revolution, to provide homogeneous training of high-school teachers in France, but it later closed. The school was subsequently reestablished by Napoleon I as &quot;pensionnat normal&quot; from 1808 to 1822, before being recreated in 1826 and taking the name École normale in 1830. When institutes for primary teachers training called &quot;écoles normales&quot; were created in 1845, the word &quot;supérieure&quot; (meaning upper) was added to form the current name. In 1936, the institution started providing university-level education.

As a &quot;grande école&quot;, the vast majority of the academic staff hosted at the ENS belong to external institutions such as one of the Parisian universities, the CNRS and the EHESS. Generalistic in its recruitment and organisation, the ENS is the only &quot;grande école&quot; in France to have departments of research in all the natural, social, and human sciences.

Its alumni include 14 Nobel Prize laureates, of which 8 are in Physics, 12 Fields Medalists, more than half the recipients of the CNRS&#x27;s Gold Medal, several hundred members of the , as well as several French and foreign politicians and statespeople.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The current institution finds its roots in the creation of the École normale de l&#x27;an III by the post-revolutionary National Convention led by Robespierre in 1794. The school was created based on a recommendation by Joseph Lakanal and Dominique-Joseph Garat, who were part of the commission on public education. The École normale was intended as the core of a planned centralised national education system. The project was also conceived as a way to reestablish trust between the Republic and the country&#x27;s elites, which had been alienated to some degree by the Reign of Terror. The decree establishing the school, issued on 30 October 1794 (&quot;9 brumaire an III&quot;), states in its first article that &quot;There will be established in Paris an &quot;école normale&quot; (literally, a normal school), where, from all the parts of the Republic, citizens already educated in the useful sciences shall be called upon to learn, from the best professors in all the disciplines, the art of teaching.&quot;

The inaugural course was given on 20 January 1795 and the last on 19 May of the same year at the Museum of Natural History. The goal of these courses was to train a body of teachers for all the secondary schools in the country and thereby to ensure a homogenous education for all. These courses covered all the existing sciences and humanities and were given by scholars such as: scientists Monge, Vandermonde, Daubenton, Berthollet and philosophers Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and Volney were some of the teachers. The school was closed as a result of the arrival of the French Directory but this &quot;école normale&quot; was to serve as a basis when the school was founded for the second time by Napoleon I in 1808.

On 17 March 1808, Napoleon created by decree a &quot;pensionnat normal&quot; within the imperial University of France charged with &quot;training in the art of teaching the sciences and the humanities&quot;. The establishment was opened in 1810, its strict code including a mandatory uniform. By then a sister establishment had been created by Napoleon in Pisa under the name of Scuola Normale Superiore (SNS), which continues to exist today and still has close ties to the Paris school. Up to 1818, the students are handpicked by the academy inspectors based on their results in the secondary school. However, the &quot;pensionnat&quot; created by Napoleon came to be perceived under the Restoration as a nexus of liberal thought and was suppressed by then-minister of public instruction Denis-Luc Frayssinous in 1824.

=== Second founding ===

An &quot;école préparatoire&quot; was created on 9 March 1826 at the site of Collège Louis-le-Grand. This date can be taken as the definitive date of creation of the current school. After the July Revolution, the school regained its original name of &quot;École normale&quot; and in 1845 was renamed &quot;École normale supérieure&quot;. During the 1830s, under the direction of philosopher Victor Cousin, the school enhanced its status as an institution to prepare the &quot;agrégation&quot; by expanding the duration of study to three years, and was divided into its present-day Sciences and Letters divisions. In 1847 the school moved into its current quarters at the rue d&#x27;Ulm, next to the Panthéon in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. This helped it gain some stability, which was further established under the direction of Louis Pasteur.

Having been recognised as a success, a second school was created on its model at Sèvres for girls in 1881, followed by other schools at Fontenay, Saint-Cloud (both of which later moved to Lyon, and Cachan). The school&#x27;s status evolved further at the beginning of the twentieth century.

In 1903 it was integrated into the University of Paris as a separate college, perhaps as a result of its exposure to national attention during the Dreyfus Affair, in which its librarian Lucien Herr and his disciples, who included the socialist politician Jean Jaurès and the writers Charles Péguy and Romain Rolland spearheaded the campaign to overturn the wrongful conviction pronounced against Captain Alfred Dreyfus. The first female student – Marguerite Rouvière – was accepted in 1910, which made headline news in France and polarised opinion.
The ranks of the school were significantly reduced during the First World War, but the 1920s marked a degree of expansion of the school, which had among its students at this time such figures as Raymond Aron, Jean-Paul Sartre, Vladimir Jankélévitch and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
The high sacrifice paid by normaliens in the First World War was recognized by the award of the croix de guerre avec citation à l ordre de l armée in 1925.

=== Twentieth century ===

After the Second World War, in which some of its students were players in the Resistance, the school became more visible and increasingly perceived as a bastion of the communist left. Many of its students belonged to the French Communist Party. This leftist tradition continued into the 1960s and 1970s during which an important fraction of French Maoists came from ENS. In 1953 it was made autonomous from the University of Paris, but it was perceived ambivalently by the authorities as a nexus of protest, particularly due to the teachings delivered there by such controversial figures as political philosopher Louis Althusser. As of now, by law, ENS comes under the direct authority of the Minister for Higher Education and Research.

The fallout from the May 1968 protests caused President of the Republic Georges Pompidou, himself a former student at the school, to force the resignation of its director, Robert Flacelière and to appoint his contemporary Jean Bousquet as his successor . Both Flacelière and Bousquet were distinguished classicists.

The school continued to expand and include new subjects, seeking to cover all the disciplines of natural and social sciences. In this manner, a new &quot;concours&quot; was opened in 1982 to reinforce the teaching of social sciences at the school. The &quot;concours&quot;, called B/L (the A/L concours standing for the traditional letters and human sciences), greatly emphasises proficiency in mathematics and economics alongside training in philosophy and literature.

For a long time, most women were taught at a separate ENS, the École normale supérieure de jeunes filles at Sèvres. However, women were not explicitly barred entry until a law of 1940, and some women were students at Ulm before this date, such as philosopher Simone Weil and classicist Jacqueline de Romilly. In 1985, after heated debates, the two were merged into a single entity with its main campus at the historic site at the rue d&#x27;Ulm in Paris.

== Organisation ==

École normale supérieure is a &quot;grande école&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Russel Group in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;grandes écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies than public universities in France, and many of their programs are taught in English, and while most are more expensive than French universities, École normale supérieure charges the same tuition fees: for 2021/2022, they were €243 to register for the master&#x27;s degree. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;grandes écoles&quot;. Degrees from École normale supérieure are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France) (). Alumni go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

=== Sites ===

The École normale supérieure is one of a few schools that still occupy a campus in the heart of Paris. The historic Paris ENS campus is located around the rue d&#x27;Ulm, the main building being at 45 rue d&#x27;Ulm in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, which was built by architect Alphonse de Gisors and given to ENS by law in 1841. Above the entrance door are sculptures of two female figures who respectively represent letters and sciences. They are portrayed sitting on either side of a medallion of Minerva, who represents wisdom. A formalised version of this frontal piece is used as the school&#x27;s emblem.

The main site at 45 rue d&#x27;Ulm is organized around a central courtyard, the Cour aux Ernests. Another courtyard south of this one, the Cour Pasteur, separates the school from the apartment buildings of the rue Claude-Bernard. These buildings house the administrative functions of the school, and some of its literary departments (philosophy, literature, classics and archeology), its mathematics and computer science departments, as well as its main human sciences library. The site&#x27;s &quot;monument aux morts&quot;, which was inaugurated in 1923 and stands as a reminder of the &quot;normaliens&quot; who died in the First World War, is a work by Paul Landowski.

Several auxiliary buildings surround this main campus in adjacent streets. The closest one, opposite the main entrance, at 46 rue d&#x27;Ulm, houses the school&#x27;s biology department and laboratories as well as a part of its student residences. The seat of the school&#x27;s physics and chemistry departments, inaugurated in 1936 by Léon Blum and Albert Lebrun, lies north of the school on rue Lhomond, while further up the rue d&#x27;Ulm its number 29 houses secondary libraries and the school&#x27;s department of cognitive sciences.

ENS has a second campus on Boulevard Jourdan (previously the women&#x27;s college), in the 14th arrondissement of Paris, which is home to the school&#x27;s research department of social sciences, law, economics and geography, as well as further student residences. The site has been undergoing major reconstruction since 2015. In 2017, President Francois Hollande inaugurated a new building on site, which is home to the ENS economics department, the school&#x27;s social science library, and the Paris School of Economics, an ENS project.

The school has a secondary site in the suburb of Montrouge, which houses some of its laboratories alongside those of Paris Descartes University. It features green areas and sporting facilities as well as some 200 student rooms. A fourth site in the town of Villejuif, south of Paris, hosts some of the school&#x27;s biology laboratories.

=== Recruitment ===

The school is very small in student numbers. Its core of students, who are called &quot;normaliens&quot;, are selected via a competitive exam called a &quot;concours&quot; (baccalaureate + 2 years). Preparation for the &quot;concours&quot; takes place in preparatory classes which last two years (see &quot;grandes écoles&quot;). Two hundred &quot;normaliens&quot; are thus recruited every year, half of them in the sciences and the same number in the humanities, and receive a monthly salary (around €1,350/month in 2018), and in exchange they sign a ten-year contract to work for the state. Although it is seldom applied in practice, this exclusivity clause is redeemable (often by the hiring firm).
Other students called &quot;normaliens étudiants&quot; can be selected but they do not have their study paid. They are selected with the preparation of a research project (baccalaureate + 2–4 years). 
PhD students at ENS are either graduate students from the ENS doctoral school or from another doctoral school co-accredited by ENS. Since 2016 PhD students preparing their doctoral research at ENS are awarded a PhD from PSL University.
ENS also welcomes selected foreign students (the &quot;international selection&quot;), participates in various graduate programs, and has extensive research laboratories. The foreign students selected often receive a scholarship which covers their expenses.

The students selected via the &quot;concours&quot; remain at the school for a length of time ranging from four to six years. &quot;Normaliens&quot; from France and other European Union countries are considered civil servants in training. Many students devote at least one of those years to the &quot;agrégation&quot;, which allows them to teach in high schools or universities. Faculty recruitment is selective, with between zero and one ENS professorship open per year. Faculty recruitments usually happen upon previous incumbent retirements. In informal ENS jargon, ENS full professors are popularly called &quot;PdPs&quot; (&quot;&quot;professeurs des professeurs&quot;)&quot; because traditionally ENS was created to educate future professors.

=== Divisions ===

Founded to train high school teachers through the &quot;agrégation&quot;, ENS is now an institution training researchers, professors, high-level civil servants, and business and political leaders. It focuses on the association of training and research, with an emphasis on freedom of curriculum. The school&#x27;s resources are equally divided between its &quot;Letters&quot; (social and human sciences and literature) and its &quot;Sciences&quot; (natural sciences and mathematics) sections. The school&#x27;s fifteen departments and its thirty-five units of research (&quot;unités mixtes de recherches&quot; or &quot;UMR&quot; in French) work in close coordination with other public French research institutions such as the CNRS.

The school has seven departments in its &quot;Sciences&quot; section: mathematics; physics; computer science; chemistry; biology; geoscience; and cognitive science. It also has eight departments in its &quot;Letters&quot; section: philosophy; literature; history; classics; social science; economics (this section is the base of Paris School of Economics); geography; and art history and theory. In addition to these fifteen departments, a language laboratory for non-specialists offers courses in most major world languages to all the students. Additional centres of research and laboratories gravitate around the departments, which function as nodes of research.

The emphasis is placed squarely on interdisciplinarity. Students who entered from a scientific &quot;concours&quot; (thus having mainly studied in their preparatory school maths, physics, and chemistry or biology) are encouraged to attend courses in the literary departments. Conversely, maths and physics introductory courses are on offer for the students from the &quot;literary&quot; departments. The ENS graduate degree, instituted in 2006, requires students to attend a certain number of courses not related to their major.

The École normale supérieure has a network, known as Rubens, of ten libraries shared over its sites, which taken together make up the third largest library in France. The catalogue is available for consultation online. Entrance to the libraries is reserved to domestic and international researchers of doctoral level, as well as to the teachers at the school, &quot;normaliens&quot;, other ENS students, and PSL Research University students. The main library, devoted to literature, classics, and human sciences, dates back to the nineteenth century when it was greatly expanded by its director, the famous dreyfusard Lucien Herr. Its main reading room is protected as a &quot;monument historique&quot;. This main library, which covers several thousand square metres, is one of the largest free access funds of books in France, with upwards of 800,000 books readily available and more than 1600 periodicals. Its classics section is part of the national network of specialised libraries (Cadist).

A secondary library concerned with social science, economics, and law is located at the Jourdan campus for social science. This library has more than 150,000 books in the subjects it covers. The school also has specialised libraries in archeology, cognitive sciences, mathematics and computer science, theoretical physics. A recently unified natural sciences library was opened in 2013, aiming to bring together in a central place on rue d&#x27;Ulm the libraries of physics, chemistry, biology and geoscience. The school also features two specialised centres for documentation, the Bibliothèque des Archives Husserl, and the Centre d&#x27;Archives de Philosophie, d&#x27;Histoire et d&#x27;Edition des Sciences.

=== Affiliations ===

Two other &quot;écoles normales supérieures&quot; were established in the 20th century: the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon (sciences and humanities); and the École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay (pure and applied sciences, sociology, economics and management, English language). More recently, the fourth &quot;école normale supérieure&quot; was created in January 2014 under the name of École Normale Supérieure de Rennes (pure and applied sciences, economics and management, law school, sport) in Brittany. All four together form the informal ENS-group.

The École normale supérieure is also an institution of PSL Research University, a union of several higher education institutions, all located in Paris, which aims at achieving cooperation and developing synergies between its member institutions to promote French research abroad. In addition to this, the École normale supérieure cooperates in Atomium Culture, the first permanent platform for European excellence that brings together some of Europe&#x27;s leading universities, newspapers and businesses. The school is a member of the Conference of University Presidents and of the Conference of Grandes Écoles.

=== Domestic partnerships ===

Its educational project being based on research, ENS seeks to train its students to become researchers. The main objective of the education given is getting a doctorate, and more than 85% of &quot;normaliens&quot; achieve this. The students are free to choose their own course of study but must at least attain a master&#x27;s degree in research. Since, traditionally, the institution does not have the powers to grand university degrees, students have to follow courses in other universities in Paris. To this end, ENS cultivates a large number of partnerships and conventions with other higher education institutions to create master&#x27;s degrees which are co-presided by two institutions. ENS works closely with the École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), the Paris-Sorbonne University, the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School in particular to deliver joint diplomas to a certain number of students who have followed courses shared between the two institutions. It is also the main partner in the Paris School of Economics project which it has launched along with the EHESS, the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l&#x27;Administration Économique (ENSAE) and the École des Ponts. This project seeks to create a unified Master&#x27;s-level economics school in Paris.

=== International partnerships ===

The Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa was founded in 1810 as a branch of the École normale supérieure by Napoleon and later gained independence. ENS and its Italian twin have retained very close links since this time and since 1988 a special partnership has 80 &quot;normaliens&quot; going to Pisa every year while half the class of the SNS spend a year at the Paris school. During its history and due to the far reach of the French Empire during the colonial era, many schools have been created around the world based on the ENS model, from Haiti (in Port-au-Prince) to Vietnam (in Hanoi) to the Maghreb (in Tunis, Casablanca, Oran, and Rabat to name but a few) and Subsaharan Africa (in Nouakchott, Libreville, Yaoundé, Dakar, Niamey, Bangui for example). ENS maintains good relations and close links with these institutions. In 2005, ENS opened a branch at the East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai, whose French name was changed to École normale supérieure de l&#x27;Est de la Chine to reflect the agreement, and a joint doctoral program between the two institutions was launched.

ENS welcomes international researchers for one-year stays through the mediation of the Paris Institute of Advanced Research and the Villa Louis-Pasteur. The Blaise Pascal, Marie Curie, Condorcet and Lagrange research places (&quot;chaires&quot;) also allow researchers from abroad to stay for more than a year at ENS laboratories. ENS also is a member of the Franco-Chinese laboratory Saladyn since 2013. It has been hosting an antenna of New York University&#x27;s Erich Maria Remarque Institute since 2007.

Furthermore, ENS has partnerships for research at Master&#x27;s and Doctorate levels, sending its students to universities around the world to complete their tuition. It also shares thesis habilitation with universities abroad, meaning that somes theses can be written with support from both the ENS and one of its partner institutions. It is also customary for students in the literary and linguistic subjects to go to teach for one year in universities abroad with the position of junior fellows. These exchange and cooperation programs link ENS with universities such as the University of Beijing in China, Freie Universität Berlin in Germany, the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh and Oxford in the United Kingdom, Trinity College in Dublin, McGill University in Montréal, and the universities at Berkeley, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale in the United States.

== Academics ==

=== Publishing ===

Since 2001, the internet portal, called Diffusion des savoirs (&quot;Spreading knowledge&quot;) has offered access to more than 2000 recordings of conferences and seminars that have taken place at the school, in all sciences natural and social. The school also has launched its own short conference platform, Les Ernest, which shows renowned specialists speaking for fifteen minutes on a given subject in a wide scope of disciplines.

In 1975 the school founded its university press, first called Presses de l&#x27;ENS then renamed in 1997 to Editions Rue d&#x27;Ulm. This press, which operates on a small scale, publishes specialist academic books mainly in the spheres of literature and the social sciences. Some 300 works are available on line on in the press&#x27;s bookshop, and about 25 new titles are published every year.

=== Foundation ===

In 1986, an ENS foundation was created and recognised as a &quot;fondation d&#x27;utilité publique&quot; by law. It contributes to the development of the school, most notably by encouraging and facilitating the reception of foreign students and researchers. The Foundation, presided by Alain-Gérard Slama, manages some investments into financed positions for foreign researchers in ENS-associated laboratories. It has for example financed the Louis Pasteur villa, situated close by ENS, which welcomes foreign researchers for extended stays. It has also contributed to financing several positions for scientists in ENS laboratories, for instance in research on telecom network security with France Télécom and on &quot;artificial vision&quot; with the Airbus foundation.

=== Rankings and reputation ===
In France, ENS has been regarded since the late 19th century as one of foremost &quot;grandes écoles&quot;. However, the ENS system is different from that of most higher education systems outside France, thus making it difficult to compare with foreign institutions; in particular, it is much smaller than a typical English collegiate university. It is ranked as the second &quot;small university&quot; worldwide behind California Institute of Technology by the 2016 Times Higher Education Smaller Universities Ranking (a ranking of institutions of fewer than 5000 students). It is generally regarded as the premier French institute for higher education and research, and it is currently ranked first among French universities by the ARWU and Times.

== Notable alumni ==


Throughout its history, a sizeable number of ENS alumni, some of them known as &quot;normaliens&quot;, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise, ranging from Louis Pasteur, the chemist and microbiologist famed for inventing pasteurisation, to philologist Georges Dumézil, novelist Julien Gracq and socialist Prime Minister Léon Blum.

=== Mathematics and physics ===

Évariste Galois, the founder of Galois theory and group theory, was an early student at ENS, then still called École préparatoire, in the 1820s, at the same time as fellow mathematician Augustin Cournot. Though mathematics continued to be taught at the school throughout the 19th century, its real dominance of the mathematic sphere would not emerge until after the First World War, with a young generation of mathematicians led by André Weil, known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry (also the brother of fellow student, philosopher Simone Weil). This rejuvenation continued into the 1930s, as exemplified by the 1935 launch of the influential Nicolas Bourbaki project, whose work permeated the field of mathematics throughout the 20th century. In 1940 former student Henri Cartan was appointed professor at the school like his father Élie Cartan, carrying the school&#x27;s importance in the field still further with his work in algebraic topology. His teaching, which continued until 1965, was vastly influential in shaping his students, who included Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat, Gustave Choquet, Jacques Dixmier, Roger Godement, René Thom and Jean-Pierre Serre. Denis Auroux, a famous symplectic geometer at Harvard University, is also an acclaimed Normalien.

Since the 1936 establishment of the Fields Medal, often called the &quot;Nobel Prize for mathematics&quot;, eleven &quot;normaliens&quot; have been recipients, contributing to ENS&#x27;s reputation as one of the world&#x27;s foremost training grounds for mathematicians: Laurent Schwartz, Jean-Pierre Serre (also a recipient of the inaugural Abel Prize in 2003), René Thom, Alain Connes, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz, Pierre-Louis Lions, Laurent Lafforgue, Wendelin Werner, Cédric Villani, Ngô Bảo Châu and Hugo Duminil-Copin. Alexander Grothendieck, also a Fields medallist, though he was not a &quot;normalien&quot;, received a substantial part of his training at the school. These twelve former students have made ENS the institution with the most Fields medallist alumni of any institution worldwide. Former student Yves Meyer was also awarded the Abel prize.

In addition, eight &quot;normaliens&quot; have gone on to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics: Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, Albert Fert, Alfred Kastler, Gabriel Lippmann, Louis Néel, Jean Baptiste Perrin and Serge Haroche, while other ENS physicists include such major figures as Paul Langevin, famous for developing Langevin dynamics and the Langevin equation. Alumnus Paul Sabatier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

=== Philosophy ===

Its position as a leading institution in the training of the critical spirit has made ENS into France&#x27;s premier training ground for future philosophers and producers of what has been called by some &quot;French theory&quot;. Its position as a philosophical birthplace can be traced back to its very beginnings, with Victor Cousin a student in the early 19th century. Two ENS philosophers won the Nobel Prize in Literature for their writings, Henri Bergson and Jean-Paul Sartre. Raymond Aron, the founder of French anti-communist thought in the 1960s and Sartre&#x27;s great adversary, was a student from the same year as Sartre, and they were both near contemporaries of phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, musicologist Vladimir Jankélévitch and historian of philosophy Maurice de Gandillac. In Sèvres, in the ENS for young women, philosopher and mystic Simone Weil was accomplishing her years of study at the same time. Jean Hyppolite, the founder of Hegelian studies in France, also studied at the school at this time and later influenced many of its students. Epistemologists Georges Canguilhem and Jean Cavaillès, the latter also known as a Résistance hero, were educated at ENS as well.

Later, Marxist political thinker Louis Althusser was a student at ENS and taught there for many years, and many of his disciples later became known for their own thought: among them were Étienne Balibar, philosopher Alain Badiou, who still teaches at the school as an emeritus professor, and Jacques Rancière. Still later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the world-renowned thinker Michel Foucault, founder of the history of systems of thought and future professor at the Collège de France was a student a few years ahead of the founder of deconstruction, Jacques Derrida and the thinker of individuation Gilbert Simondon. The tradition continues today through such philosophers as Jacques Bouveresse, Jean-Luc Marion, Claudine Tiercelin, Francis Wolff and Quentin Meillassoux, and the school has also produced prominent public intellectuals like Stéphane Hessel and such New Philosophers as Bernard-Henri Lévy and Benny Lévy.

Contributing to ENS&#x27;s role as the centre of the structuralist school of thought, alongside Althusser and Foucault, major psychoanalyst and psychiatrist Jacques Lacan taught there in the 1960s, notably giving his course, &quot;The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis&quot;, in 1964. This period of his teaching is significant as it is the one in which it acquired &quot;a much larger audience&quot; than before and represented a &quot;change of front&quot; from his previous work. During this time the school became a focal point of the École freudienne de Paris, and many of Lacan&#x27;s disciples were educated there, including psychoanalysts Jacques-Alain Miller and Jean-Claude Milner, the first president of the World Association of Psychoanalysis.

=== History and literature ===

One of the school&#x27;s foremost specialities has always been the teaching of history, and as such it has produced a large number of renowned historians who have been important in the development of their subject, starting with Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, Ernest Lavisse and Jérôme Carcopino, all students of the school in the second half of the nineteenth century who later would come back to direct it. Around the turn of the century two men who would become the founders of the Annales School, Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, studied at the school. Jacqueline de Romilly and Pierre Grimal, respectively historians of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, were both students at the school starting in 1933. Sinologist Marcel Granet, medievalist Jacques Le Goff, Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, archaeologist Paul Veyne, ancien régime specialist Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Pre-Columbian civilisation anthropologist Jacques Soustelle were all students at the school, as well as Georges Dumézil, who revolutionised comparative philology and mythography with his analyses of sovereignty in Proto-Indo-European religion and formulated the trifunctional hypothesis of social class in ancient societies.

The school has a long-standing reputation as a training ground for men and women of letters, and its alumni include novelist and dramatist Jean Giraudoux, many of whose plays among which &quot;The Trojan War Will Not Take Place&quot; and &quot;Amphitryon 38&quot; have become staple elements of the French theatrical repertory; and acclaimed novelist Julien Gracq, whose 1951 novel &quot;The Opposing Shore&quot; is now considered a classic. Poet Paul Celan and Nobel Prize in Literature winner Samuel Beckett were both teachers at the school. Jules Romains, the founder of &quot;Unanimism&quot;, essayists Paul Nizan and Robert Brasillach, novelist Nobel Prize in Literature winner Romain Rolland and poet Charles Péguy are a few other examples of major authors who were educated there. The school has also long been a centre for literary criticism and theory, from one-time director Gustave Lanson to major twentieth-century figures of the field such as Paul Bénichou, Jean-Pierre Richard and Gérard Genette. The founder of the influential &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, Martinican poet Aimé Césaire, prepared and passed the entrance exam from the Lycée Louis-le-Grand where he was friends with future President of Senegal and fellow &quot;Négritude&quot; author Léopold Sédar Senghor, who failed the entrance exam. Around this same period Algerian novelist, essayist and filmmaker Assia Djebar, who would become one of the most prominent voices of Arab feminism, was a student at the school, as well as Belgian writer Éric-Emmanuel Schmitt.

=== Social sciences and economics ===

There is a tradition of social sciences at the school, and Émile Durkheim, regarded as one of the founders of the discipline of sociology, was a student at the school in 1879, around the same time as Théodule Ribot, a psychologist well known for developing Ribot&#x27;s Law. Pierre Bourdieu, who studied dynamics of power in society and its transmission over generations and became a vocal critic of the French system of &quot;grandes écoles&quot; and notably ENS as the standard-bearer of that system, studied at ENS in the early 1950s, at the same time as his later intellectual adversary, individualist Raymond Boudon, both of them having taken and passed the &quot;agrégation&quot; in philosophy at the end of their studies at the school. Other major ENS sociologists and anthropologists include Maurice Halbwachs, Alain Touraine and Philippe Descola. The school also has a tradition of geography, with the founder of modern French geography and of the French School of Geopolitics Paul Vidal de La Blache having been a student at the school starting in 1863.

As for economics, its history at the school is less long, as it was not among the subjects first taught at the school. However, Gérard Debreu won the 1983 Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, and there is a growing output of economists from ENS, as evidenced by the young generation of French economists represented by Emmanuel Saez, winner of the 2009 John Bates Clark Medal, Esther Duflo, who won the same medal in 2010 and the Nobel prize in 2019, and Thomas Piketty, author of the 2013 bestseller &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot;. Since its creation in 2000, ten of the twenty recipients of the Prize of the best young French economist have been ENS alumni, including Antoine Bozio (who now teaches at EHESS), Camille Landais (LSE), Emmanuel Farhi (Harvard), Pascaline Dupas (Stanford) and Xavier Gabaix (Harvard).

=== Government and politics ===

ENS has never had a public policy division, but some of its students have become leading statesmen and politicians. Third Republic Prime Ministers Jules Simon, Léon Blum, Édouard Herriot and Paul Painlevé as well as socialist leader Jean Jaurès were early examples of this trend. At this time, quite a few ENS former students and intellectuals were drawn to socialism, such as Pierre Brossolette who became a Resistance hero and a major national leader during World War II. The institution has continued to be seen as a left-wing school since then. Later, as ENS came increasingly to be seen by some as an antechamber to the École nationale d&#x27;administration, more young students drawn to politics and public policy began to be attracted to it, such as future President of the Republic Georges Pompidou, Prime Ministers Alain Juppé and Laurent Fabius, and ministers such as Bruno Le Maire and Michel Sapin, former Ministers of Finance of France.

<text>Cecil Edward Parkinson, Baron Parkinson, (1 September 1931 – 22 January 2016) was a British Conservative Party politician and cabinet minister. A chartered accountant by training, he entered Parliament in November 1970, and was appointed a minister in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s first government in May 1979. He successfully managed the Conservative Party&#x27;s 1983 election campaign, and was rewarded with an appointment as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, but was forced to resign following revelations that his former secretary, Sara Keays, was pregnant with his child, whom she later bore and named Flora Keays. Flora was born with severe cerebral palsy.

Parkinson subsequently served as Secretary of State for Energy, and later Secretary of State for Transport. He resigned that office in 1990, on the same day that Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister. He was created Baron Parkinson in 1992, and served in the House of Lords until his retirement in September 2015.

==Early life==
Cecil Parkinson was born at 4 Edward Street, Carnforth, Lancashire, the son of Sydney Parkinson (13 April 1906 – 15 July 1995), a warehouseman for a corn dealer, later a railwayman, and his wife, Bridget, née Graham (29 January 1910 – 1991), who was from a Northern Irish family from Tyrone and Fermanagh but their roots were in Scotland. He had a younger sister, Norma (b. March 1933). He was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, a state-run day and boarding school for boys, from 1943 to 1950 after passing his eleven-plus from where he won a scholarship to Cambridge University, where he read English at Emmanuel College, later switching to read law. He won a Blue as an athlete, competing over 220 and 440 yards. While at university, Parkinson was a Labour supporter and for a time was a member of that party. He even canvassed for them at the 1950 and 1951 General Elections. He did National service as an NCO in the Royal Air Force from 1950 to 1952.

After leaving university, Parkinson worked as a manager for the Metal Box Company, later becoming a consultant. He trained and qualified as a chartered accountant, and founded Parkinson-Hart Securities in 1961.

==Member of Parliament==
In the June 1970 general election Parkinson stood as Conservative candidate for Northampton, but was not elected. He was elected MP for Enfield West at a by-election in November 1970, following the death of Iain Macleod. When that constituency was abolished for the February 1974 general election he was elected for the new South Hertfordshire constituency. Following the 1979 general election he was made a junior trade minister. On 14 September 1981, he was appointed Chairman of the Conservative Party as well as Paymaster General with a seat in the cabinet; he was given the added official title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1982. Despite his relatively junior status, he was a member of the small War Cabinet that Margaret Thatcher set up to run the Falklands War.

===In government===
He worked on the Conservative Party&#x27;s 1983 election campaign, standing in the new Hertsmere constituency after South Hertfordshire&#x27;s abolition. As a result of his success on the campaign, Thatcher had intended to promote him to Foreign Secretary; however, before the election he warned her that this would be unwise, for his former secretary, Sara Keays, was pregnant with his child. Although Thatcher initially remonstrated with him that Anthony Eden&#x27;s womanising had been no bar on his being Foreign Secretary, she instead appointed him Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

Parkinson was forced to resign on 14 October 1983, after the news of Sara Keays&#x27;s pregnancy had become public knowledge. The child was born on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and christened Flora Keays. Subsequently, as a result of a dispute over child maintenance payments, Parkinson (with Keays&#x27;s initial consent) was able to gain an injunction in 1993, forbidding the British media from making any reference to their daughter. Following the birth, Parkinson released a statement in which he wished the baby &quot;peace, privacy and a happy life&quot;. Flora Keays has learning difficulties and Asperger syndrome, and also underwent an operation to remove a brain tumour when she was four, although it is unknown whether this either caused or complicated her condition.

This court order was the subject of some controversy until Flora Keays reached the age of 18 at the end of 2001, when the court order expired. It was stated in the press that Parkinson had never met his child and presumably had no intention of doing so. While he had assisted with Flora&#x27;s education and her financial upkeep, it was publicly pointed out that he had not even sent her a birthday card and that her mother assumed that Flora could not ever expect to receive one.

At the time of the revelation of Parkinson&#x27;s relationship with Sara Keays, he made much of what he described as the volume of letters in support that he received. Many in the Conservative Party attacked Keays. Edwina Currie said on 7 October 1985, whilst herself having an affair with John Major, &quot;I feel very very sorry for Cecil and his family. Most of my thoughts on Sara Keays are unprintable. Perhaps the most polite thing to say is she&#x27;s a right cow&quot;. By 2001, however, the media focused more upon Flora and her difficulties than on protecting Parkinson&#x27;s reputation, so more voices were raised in criticism of Parkinson.

Following four years on the back benches, he was appointed Secretary of State for Energy in 1987 (having been tipped as a potential Chancellor of the Exchequer), and for Transport in the July 1989 reshuffle. One of the highlights during his tenure of the latter job was announcing new main-line rail tunnels across London, called Crossrail. He resigned along with Margaret Thatcher when she was replaced by John Major and stood down from the House of Commons at the 1992 general election.

Following the 1992 election, he was created Baron Parkinson, of Carnforth, in the County of Lancashire, on 29 June 1992.

That year, Parkinson also published his memoirs, in which he claimed that, with a determined campaign, Thatcher would have won the second ballot of the Conservative leadership election, when her Cabinet had warned her she would lose and thus persuaded her to stand down.

===Shadow Cabinet===
Parkinson returned to front-line politics when he was made Conservative Party Chairman again, by William Hague, in June 1997. He retired from this role in 1998; afterwards he kept a low profile, although he was a vice-chairman of the Conservative Way Forward group. He was also the Honorary President of Conservative Friends of Poland.

==Personal life==

Parkinson married Ann Mary Jarvis on 2 February 1957. They had three daughters: Mary, Emma and Joanna. Mary was found hanged in December 2017 following a period of depression after her father&#x27;s death in 2016.

As a result of an extra-marital affair with Sara Keays, his personal secretary, he fathered a daughter, Flora, whom he never met or acknowledged.

He was a supporter of Preston North End, and in November 1988 paid a tribute to Tom Finney on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

Parkinson was an active freemason.

==Death==

Parkinson died from colorectal cancer at The London Clinic in Marylebone, London, on 22 January 2016. He left nothing in his will for his daughter Flora: in April 2017, it was reported that Sara Keays was preparing to sue Parkinson&#x27;s estate to continue to gain support for her daughter&#x27;s 24-hour care, for regular payments had ceased a few months after Parkinson died.

Parkinson&#x27;s daughter, Mary, was found dead at her home in Wandsworth on 10 December 2017, aged 57. Police did not treat the death as suspicious, and it was later reported that she had taken her own life.

==Charitable works==
He was one of the three presidents of the UK-based charity Action on Addiction.

==In the media==
Parkinson&#x27;s affair with Sara Keays was a running joke in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; for over a decade (and on the satirical TV programme &quot;Spitting Image&quot; for nearly as long), with the magazine seldom passing up an opportunity to portray Parkinson as having a voracious sexual appetite. The relationship was the subject of a 2024 Channel 5 television documentary, &quot;A Very British Sex Scandal: The Love Child &amp; the Secretary&quot;, aired from 1 May.

He was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;

<text>Laurent-Moïse Schwartz (; 5 March 1915 – 4 July 2002) was a French mathematician. He pioneered the theory of distributions, which gives a well-defined meaning to objects such as the Dirac delta function. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950 for his work on the theory of distributions. For several years he taught at the École polytechnique.

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Laurent Schwartz came from a Jewish family of Alsatian origin, with a strong scientific background: his father was a well-known surgeon, his uncle Robert Debré (who contributed to the creation of UNICEF) was a famous pediatrician, and his great-uncle-in-law, Jacques Hadamard, was a famous mathematician.

During his training at Lycée Louis-le-Grand to enter the École Normale Supérieure, he fell in love with Marie-Hélène Lévy, daughter of the probabilist Paul Lévy who was then teaching at the École polytechnique. They married in 1938. Later they had two children, Marc-André and Claudine. Marie-Hélène was gifted in mathematics as well, as she contributed to the geometry of singular analytic spaces and taught at the University of Lille.

Angelo Guerraggio describes &quot;Mathematics, politics and butterflies&quot; as Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;three great loves&quot;.

=== Education ===
According to his teachers, Schwartz was an exceptional student. He was particularly gifted in Latin, Greek and mathematics. One of his teachers told his parents: &quot;Beware, some will say your son has a gift for languages, but he is only interested in the scientific and mathematical aspect of languages: he should become a mathematician.&quot;

In 1934, he was admitted at the École Normale Supérieure, and in 1937 he obtained the agrégation (with rank 2).

=== World War II ===
As a man of Trotskyist affinities and Jewish descent, life was difficult for Schwartz during World War II. He had to hide and change his identity to avoid being deported after Nazi Germany overran France. He worked for the University of Strasbourg (which had been relocated to Clermont-Ferrand because of the war) under the name of Laurent-Marie Sélimartin (his thesis &quot;Étude des sommes d&#x27;exponentielles réelles&quot; being however published in 1943 under his real name in the Publications de l&#x27;Institut de Mathématique de l&#x27;Université de Clermont-Ferrand, volume 959 of Hermann&#x27;s Actualités scientifiques et industrielles), while Marie-Hélène used the name Lengé instead of Lévy. Unlike other mathematicians at Clermont-Ferrand such as Feldbau, the couple managed to escape the Nazis.

=== Later career ===
Schwartz taught mainly at École Polytechnique, from 1958 to 1980. At the end of the war, he spent one year in Grenoble (1944), then in 1945 joined the University of Nancy on the advice of Jean Delsarte and Jean Dieudonné, where he spent seven years. He was both an influential researcher and teacher, with students such as Bernard Malgrange, Jacques-Louis Lions, François Bruhat and Alexander Grothendieck. He joined the science faculty of the University of Paris in 1952. In 1958 he became a teacher at the École polytechnique after having at first refused this position. From 1961 to 1963 the École polytechnique suspended his right to teach, because of his having signed the Manifesto of the 121 about the Algerian war, a gesture not appreciated by Polytechnique&#x27;s military administration. However, Schwartz had a lasting influence on mathematics at the École polytechnique, having reorganized both teaching and research there. In 1965 he established the &quot;Centre de mathématiques Laurent-Schwartz&quot; (CMLS) as its first director.

In 1973 he was elected corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences, and was promoted to full membership in 1975.

== Mathematical legacy ==
In 1950 at the International Congress of Mathematicians, Schwartz was a plenary speaker and was awarded the Fields Medal for his work on distributions. He was the first French mathematician to receive the Fields medal. Because of his sympathy for Trotskyism, Schwartz encountered serious problems trying to enter the United States to receive the medal; however, he was ultimately successful.

The theory of distributions clarified the (then) mysteries of the Dirac delta function and Heaviside step function. It helps to extend the theory of Fourier transforms and is now of critical importance to the theory of partial differential equations.

==Popular science==
Throughout his life, Schwartz actively worked to promote science and bring it closer to the general audience. Schwartz said: &quot;What are mathematics helpful for? Mathematics are helpful for physics. Physics helps us make fridges. Fridges are made to contain spiny lobsters, and spiny lobsters help mathematicians who eat them and have hence better abilities to do mathematics, which are helpful for physics, which helps us make fridges which...&quot;

==Entomology==
His mother, who was passionate about natural science, passed on her taste for entomology to Laurent. His 
personal collection of 20,000 Lepidoptera specimens, collected during his various travels, was bequeathed to the
Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle, the Science Museum of Lyon, the Museum of Toulouse and the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny in Cochabamba (Bolivia). Several species discovered by Schwartz bear his name.

== Personal ideology ==
Apart from his scientific work, Schwartz was a well-known outspoken intellectual. As a young socialist influenced by Leon Trotsky, Schwartz opposed the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union, particularly under Joseph Stalin. Schwartz broke with Trotskyism in 1947 and wrote that his &quot;political culture comes almost entirely from that Trotskyist period&quot;.

On his religious views, Schwartz called himself an atheist.

<doc id="317487" wikidata="Q332533" url="?curid=317487" title="Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney">
<text>Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney (24 February 1733 – 30 June 1800) was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1754 to 1783 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Sydney. He held several important Cabinet posts in the second half of the 18th century. The cities of Sydney in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Sydney in New South Wales, Australia were named in his honour, in 1785 and 1788, respectively.

==Background and education==
Townshend was born in Frognal House, Sidcup, Kent, the son of the Hon. Thomas Townshend, who was the second son of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, also known as &quot;Turnip&quot; Townshend for his agricultural innovations. Thomas Townshend the younger&#x27;s mother was Albinia, daughter of John Selwyn. He was educated at Clare College, Cambridge.

==Political career==

Townshend was elected to the House of Commons in 1754 as Whig member for Whitchurch in Hampshire, and held that seat till his elevation to the peerage in 1783. He initially aligned himself with his great-uncle the Duke of Newcastle, but later joined William Pitt the Elder in opposition to George Grenville.

He held the offices of Clerk of the Household to the Prince of Wales (1756–1760) and Clerk of the Green Cloth from 1761 to 1762. In 1765 he was also made a Lord of the Treasury in the first Rockingham ministry and continued in that office in the Pitt (then Lord Chatham) administration until December 1767, when he became a member of the Privy Council and joint-Paymaster of the Forces. During the ministry of Lord Chatham and the Duke of Grafton he supported the position his cousin Charles Townshend was in with regard to the American revenue program. Townshend was forced out of office in June 1768 by Grafton who wanted Rigby as Paymaster of the Forces to gain favour with the Duke of Bedford.

Townshend remained in opposition until the end of Lord North&#x27;s ministry and spoke frequently in the House of Commons against the American Revolutionary War. Although he had no close party connection, he was inclined toward the Chathamites. He took office again as secretary at war in the second Rockingham ministry. When Lord Shelburne became Prime Minister in July 1782, Townshend succeeded him as Home Secretary and became Leader of the House of Commons.

Among the matters requiring attention that he inherited from Shelburne was a scheme for attacking the Spanish possessions in South America. A memorandum which Shelburne wrote to him at this time listing matters requiring his urgent attention said: &quot;Preparations and Plans for W. India [Spanish America]. Expeditions require to be set forward—Major Dalrymple has a Plan against the Spanish Settlements&quot;. For assistance in planning the expedition, Townshend turned to Captain Arthur Phillip. The plan drawn up by Phillip and approved by Townshend in September 1782 was for a squadron of three ships of the line and a frigate to mount a raid on Buenos Aires and Monte Video, from there to proceed to the coasts of Chile, Peru and Mexico to maraud, and ultimately to cross the Pacific to join the British East Indian squadron for an attack on Manila, the capital of the Spanish Philippines. The expedition sailed on 16 January 1783, under the command of Commodore Sir Robert Kingsmill. Phillip was given command of one of the ships of the line, the 64-gun , or &quot;Europe&quot;. Shortly after sailing an armistice was concluded between Great Britain and Spain. Phillip took the &quot;Europe&quot; to India to join the British East Indian squadron, but after his return to England in April 1784, remained in close contact with Townshend (now Lord Sydney) and the Home Office Under Secretary, Evan Nepean. From October 1784 to September 1786 he was employed by Nepean, who was in charge of the Secret Service relating to the Bourbon Powers, France and Spain, to spy on the French naval arsenals at Toulon and other ports.

Townshend was created Baron Sydney of Chislehurst and entered the House of Lords on 6 March 1783. He originally proposed his title to be Baron Sidney, in honour of his kinsman, the renowned opponent of royal tyranny, Algernon Sidney, however he was worried that other members of his family might have claims on it and then suggested Sydenham, the name of a village near his home in Kent, before settling on Sydney. He opposed the Fox-North coalition and returned to political office with Pitt, serving as Home Secretary from 1783 to 1789.

In Canada, Sydney, Nova Scotia on Cape Breton Island (now the province of Nova Scotia), was founded by British Col. Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres in 1785, and named in honour of Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney (Home Secretary in the British cabinet at the time). Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres governor of the new colony of Cape Breton Island.

Following the loss of the Thirteen Colonies, Sydney, as Home Secretary in the Pitt Government, was given responsibility for devising a plan to settle convicts at Botany Bay. His choice of Arthur Phillip as Governor was inspired, and Phillip&#x27;s leadership was instrumental in ensuring the penal colony survived the early years of struggle and famine. On 26 January 1788, Phillip named Sydney Cove in honour of Sydney and the settlement became known as Sydney Town. In 1789 Townshend was created Viscount Sydney.

Although the colonisation of New South Wales was just one among many responsibilities of the Secretary of State, Sydney was recognised as the &quot;Originator of the Plan of Colonization for New South Wales&quot; by David Collins, who dedicated his &quot;Account of the English Colony in New South Wales&quot; with these words. Collins wrote that Sydney&#x27;s &quot;benevolent Mind&quot; had led him &quot;to conceive this Method of redeeming many Lives that might be forfeit to the offended Laws; but which, being preserved under salutary Regulations, might afterward become useful to Society&quot;; and to Sydney&#x27;s &quot;Patriotism the Plan presented a Prospect of commercial and political Advantage&quot;. In choosing the name &quot;Sydney&quot; when he was raised to the peerage in 1783, Thomas Townshend demonstrated his pride in descent from the Sidney family, who had been eminent opponents of Stuart absolutism. Sydney thought of himself as a Whig, by which he meant he was opposed to any increase in the power and authority of the Royal prerogative. The name &quot;Sydney&quot; (with special reference to Algernon Sydney, d.1683) was a synonym in the eighteenth century political lexicon for opposition to tyranny and absolutism. It is probable that Sydney was aware of his distinguished ancestor, Algernon Sidney&#x27;s characterisation of the founders of imperial Rome: “Thus we find a few Men assembling together upon the Banks of the Tiber, resolv’d to build a City, and set up a Government among themselves”. Sydney was responsible for giving the new colony a constitution and judicial system suitable for a colony of free citizens rather than a prison. Phillip&#x27;s second commission of 2 April 1787 made him governor of a colony with a civil government, not of a penal settlement with a military government. The Governor&#x27;s commission, together with the colony&#x27;s charter of justice establishing the legal regime, brought into existence in New South Wales a colony whose inhabitants enjoyed all the rights and duties of English law, where slavery was illegal.

== Personal life ==
Sydney married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Powys, MP, in 1760. He died in June 1800, aged 67, and was succeeded in his titles by his son, John. Sydney was buried in the Scadbury chapel in the parish church of St Nicholas&#x27;s in Chislehurst in southeast London, where a large memorial tablet to him may be seen. The Viscountess Sydney died in May 1826, aged 90.

Their daughter, Mary (died 1821), married John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, but had no children.

== Reputation ==
Sydney&#x27;s reputation has suffered at the hands of the nationalist school of Australian historians, such as Manning Clark. In his influential &quot;A History of Australia&quot; (Melbourne University Press 1961) Clark wrote: &quot;Mr Thomas Townshend, commonly denominated Tommy Townshend, owed his political career to a very independent fortune and a considerable parliamentary interest, which contributed to his personal no less than his political elevation, for his abilities, though respectable, scarcely rose above mediocrity.&quot; Other writers have portrayed Sydney as a cruel monster for dispatching the unfortunate convicts to the far side of the earth.

Sydney can be described, by the standards of his time, as an enlightened and progressive politician. He did not support the American Revolution but was a strong opponent of the war which he thought was pointless and needlessly prolonged during Lord North&#x27;s ministry. As Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary he was heavily involved in the development of Canada and the settling of fleeing refugees from the intolerant rebels. The city of Sydney in Nova Scotia is named after him in memory of his efforts on behalf of the loyalist settlers of Canada. In a parallel situation for the Royal Townships of the yet-to-be-formed colony of Upper Canada the thoroughfares of the United Empire Loyalist settlement of Cornwall, Ontario were, in 1784, named Pitt Street and Sydney Street in honour of the prime minister and his foreign secretary.

In 1986, preceding celebrations of the Australian Bicentenary, Sydney was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post depicting his portrait. In 1992, a monument in bronze and marble commemorating both the First Fleet and Viscount Sydney was unveiled in Sydney Square, outside Sydney Town Hall by Queen Elizabeth II.

More recently Sydney&#x27;s reputation has been revisited by Australian historians. Alan Atkinson wrote in &quot;The Europeans in Australia&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1997): &quot;Townshend was an anomaly in the British Cabinet, and his ideas were in some ways old-fashioned... He had long been interested in the way in which the empire might be a medium for British liberties, traditionally understood.&quot; He took the view that convicts should be given the chance to redeem themselves through self-government in penal colonies such as New South Wales. Governor Phillip&#x27;s well-known statement that &quot;There will be no slavery in a new country and hence no slaves&quot; is an accurate reflection of Sydney&#x27;s philosophy. Sydney&#x27;s papers are held by the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan.

<doc id="317490" wikidata="Q6014339" url="?curid=317490" title="Incest in the Bible">
<text>Narratives featuring incest can be found in the Hebrew Bible, which contains mentions of various types of sexual relationships. It also lays out rules and regulations with regard to prohibited degree of kinship. These prohibitions are found predominantly in
 and , but also in Deuteronomy. 

Endogamy was the preferred practice in many parts of the ancient Near East; the ideal marriage, in fact, was usually one to a cousin, and it was often forbidden for an eldest daughter to even marry outside of the family at all. Other endogamous relationships, namely avunculate marriages and sibling marriages, while considered outright incestuous by most of the world today, were also common among a number of ancient Near Eastern societies, such as that of Egypt&#x27;s pharaohs. 

Biblical commentary on human sexual behaviour is less critical for events that are described as taking place before the Law of Moses was issued by God to the Israelites. For example, the Book of Genesis discusses the marriage of Abraham and Sarah without criticizing the fact that they were half-siblings, and the Book of Samuel treats the marriage of a royal prince to his half-sister as simply unusual, rather than wicked.

==Instances==
The Hebrew Bible mentions a number of instances in which marriage and sexual intercourse occurs between close kin, mostly dated to before the Sinai period:

* In , Ham saw his father Noah&#x27;s nakedness. The Talmud suggests that Ham may have sodomized Noah (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 70a). In more recent times, some scholars have suggested that Ham may have had intercourse with his father&#x27;s wife.
* Abraham&#x27;s brother Nahor married his niece Milcah, the daughter of his other brother Haran.
* Living in an isolated area after the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two daughters of Lot conspired to inebriate and seduce their father due to the lack of available sexual partners. Because of intoxication, Lot &quot;perceived not&quot; when his first-born daughter, and the following night his younger daughter, lay with him. () The two children born were directly Lot&#x27;s sons and indirectly his grandsons, being his daughters&#x27; sons. Likewise, their sons were also half-brothers (between them and with their mothers), having the same father, as well as cousins, having mothers that were sisters.
* In one of the tales of a wife confused for a sister, Abraham admitted that his wife Sarah is his half-sister—the daughter of his father, but not his mother. However, in rabbinic literature, Sarah is considered Abraham&#x27;s niece (the daughter of his brother, Haran).
* Marriage of cousins was common in the pre-Sinai period. Abraham&#x27;s son Isaac married Rebekah, his first cousin once removed, the granddaughter of his father Abraham&#x27;s brother Nahor with Milcah.
* Isaac and Rebekah&#x27;s firstborn son Esau resorted to marrying his cousin Mahalath, daughter of his father&#x27;s brother Ishmael because his parents didn&#x27;t approve of him having relationships with Canaanites.
* Isaac and Rebekah&#x27;s second son Jacob married his cousins Leah and Rachel, who were daughters of his mother&#x27;s brother Laban. Leah and Rachel were sisters; a wife&#x27;s sister is also forbidden.
* Jacob&#x27;s firstborn son Reuben had sex with his father&#x27;s concubine Bilhah.
* Judah, Jacob&#x27;s fourth son, mistook his daughter-in-law Tamar for a prostitute while she was veiled, and had sex with her.
* Amram married his paternal aunt Jochebed, the mother of Miriam, Aaron, and Moses. However, according to the Septuagint, she was his cousin.
* Amnon, King David&#x27;s eldest son and heir to the throne, raped his half-sister Tamar. Tamar&#x27;s brother, Absalom, learned of the incident and, two years later, ordered his servants to have Amnon killed. In vain with Amnon, Tamar said, &quot;Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee&quot;.
* Absalom, son of King David, in the middle of a rebellion against his father, had sex with his father&#x27;s concubines on the roof inside a tent.
* Rehoboam, son of Solomon and Naamah, married Maacah daughter of Absalom. 2 Samuel 14:27 does not list Maacah as a daughter of Absalom, but Absalom seems to have had sex with the wives of David, his father, at the advice of Ahithophel.
* Zelophehad&#x27;s daughters, Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, married their cousins on their father&#x27;s side to obey the Lord&#x27;s command. The Lord said: &quot;no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another&quot;.
* Caleb said, &quot;I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher.&quot; Othniel, son of Caleb&#x27;s brother Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel&#x27;s wife.

==Prohibited relationships==
 and sets out lists of prohibited relationships, and two chapters later specify punishments for such unions, but the second list of unions is much shorter than the first. Critical scholars regard the lists as having originally been independent documents, bound together at a later point. The Deuteronomic Code gives a yet more simple list of prohibited relationships a man&#x27;s parent&#x27;s daughter (including his sister), a man&#x27;s father&#x27;s wife (including his mother), and a man&#x27;s mother-in-law. In the Hebrew Bible, sexual relationships between siblings are forbidden to Jews but permissible to Gentiles (non-Jews).

The relationships prohibited by Leviticus 18 are:

* One&#x27;s mother ()
* One&#x27;s father ()
* One&#x27;s stepmother ()
* One&#x27;s paternal or maternal sister ()
* One&#x27;s paternal sister through one&#x27;s father&#x27;s wife ()
* One&#x27;s daughter (&quot;inferred from&quot; )
* One&#x27;s granddaughter ()
* A woman and her daughter ()
* A woman and her granddaughter ()
* One&#x27;s aunt by blood ()
* One&#x27;s father&#x27;s brother (uncle) ()
* One&#x27;s father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife (aunt) ()
* One&#x27;s daughter-in-law ()
* One&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wife (sister-in-law) (), with the exception of Yibum
* One&#x27;s wife&#x27;s sister (sister-in-law) during one&#x27;s wife&#x27;s lifetime, even if since divorced ()

The lists of prohibited relationships can be summarised as follows (the relations highlighted in red are those that are prohibited):

One of the most notable features of each list is that sexual relations between a man and his own daughter is not explicitly prohibited. Although the first relation mentioned after the Levitical prohibition of sex with &quot;near kin&quot; names that of &quot;thy father&quot;, it must be taken into account that the Hebrew original text only addresses male Jews with regard to their female relatives. The Talmud argues that the absence is because the prohibition was &quot;obvious&quot;, especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter, although some biblical scholars have instead proposed that it was originally in the list, but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe. The second list in the Holiness code noticeably differs from the first by not including the closer relatives, and it might be assumed that &quot;obviousness&quot; is the explanation here as well. One might argue that the explicit prohibition against engaging in sexual activity with a woman as well as with her daughter, implicitly forbids sexual activity between a man and his daughter. However, the rationale might suggest otherwise (the original text is unclear here), since it mentions only that &quot;they&quot; (i.e., the woman and the daughter) are related. John Calvin did not consider the father-daughter-relation to be explicitly forbidden by the Bible, but regarded it as immoral nevertheless.

Apart from the case of the daughter, the first incest list in Leviticus roughly produces the same rules as applied in early (pre-Islamic) Arabic culture; in Islam, these pre-Islamic rules were made statutory.

Ezekiel implies that, in his time, marriage between a man and his stepmother, or his daughter-in-law, or his sister, were frequent. This situation seems to be the target of the Deuteronomic version of the incest prohibition, which only addresses roughly the same three issues (though prohibiting the mother-in-law in place of the daughter-in-law). Early rabbinic commentators instead argue that the Deuteronomic list is so short because the other possible liaisons were &quot;obviously&quot; prohibited, and these three were the only liaisons difficult to detect, as, in their day, a man&#x27;s stepmother, half-sister, and mother-in-law usually lived in the same house as the man (prior to any liaison).

Also, cousins are not included in the lists of prohibited relationships. It is not considered incestuous. 

===Sex-specific rules===
The biblical lists are not symmetrical the implied rules for women are not the same – they compare as follows:

<text>The Sharon plain (; ) is the central section of the Israeli coastal plain. The plain lies between the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Samarian Hills, to the east. It stretches from Nahal Taninim, a stream marking the southern end of Mount Carmel in the north, to the Yarkon River in the south, at the northern limit of Tel Aviv, over a total of about . The level of the Sharon plain is connected to the level of the Mediterranean Sea by the Sharon Escarpment.

Parts of the plain are included in the Central, Haifa and Tel Aviv Districts of Israel.

== History ==
=== Early ===
The Sharon valley is mentioned in an ancient Egyptian stele of Amenhotep II, and as the Sharon field containing both Jaffa and Dor on the Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II.

The Plain of Sharon is mentioned in the Bible (1 Chronicles 5:16, 27:29; Book of Isaiah 33:9, 35:2, 65:10), including the famous reference to the enigmatic &quot;Rose of Sharon&quot; (Song of Songs 2:1).

Excavations were performed before road construction in the north part of Sharon plain. Near En Esur, an early Bronze Age planned metropolis, including a temple, stretching over 65 ha for 6,000 inhabitants, was discovered. Under the 5000-year-old city, an even older settlement from 7000 YBP has been found, according to a report from the antiquities office of Israel on 6 October 2019.

=== Modern ===
Before the 20th century, the region was covered by the Forest of Sharon, an open woodland dominated by Mount Tabor Oak &quot;(Quercus ithaburensis)&quot;, which extended from Kfar Yona in the north to Ra’ananna in the south. The area was called al-Ghāba in Arabic, “The forest, e.g. the great Oak forest of Sharon”. The local Arab inhabitants traditionally used the area for pasture, firewood and intermittent cultivation. The intensification of settlement and agriculture in the coastal plain during the 19th century led to deforestation and subsequent environmental degradation known from Hebrew sources.

Prior to 1948, the region was subordinate to Jaffa Subdistrict and Tulkarm Subdistrict.

Historically, while some parts of the Sharon plain were very fertile, much of it was swampy and malarial, a condition exacerbated by massive Ottoman deforestation. Zionist immigrants arrived in the early 20th century and populated the region with many settlements.

By 1945, Jaffa Subdistrict had a population of 373,800, consisting of 71% Jewish residents and 29% Palestinian Muslim and Christian residents. Tulkarm Subdistrict had a population 86,120, consisting of 17% Jewish residents and 83% Palestinian Muslim and Christian residents. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Arab population of the region left or was expelled almost entirely.

In 2008, it was the most densely populated region of Israel.

<doc id="317493" wikidata="Q1248082" url="?curid=317493" title="Have Gun – Will Travel">
<text>Have Gun – Will Travel is an American Western television series that was produced and originally broadcast by CBS on both television and radio from 1957 through 1963. The television version of the series starring Richard Boone was rated number three or number four in the Nielsen ratings every year of its first four seasons.

Set in the period of the Old West, the series follows the adventures of &quot;Paladin,&quot; played by Boone, a gentleman investigator/gunfighter who travels around the Old West working as a gunfighter for hire. Although Paladin charges steep fees to clients who can afford to hire him, typically $1,000 per job, he provides his services for free to poor people who need his help.

A radio series starring John Dehner debuted November 23, 1958, more than a year after the premiere of its televised counterpart, making &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; one of the few shows in television history to spawn a successful radio version.

==Premise==
This series follows the adventures of a man calling himself &quot;Paladin&quot; (played by Richard Boone on television and voiced by John Dehner on radio), taking his name from that of the foremost knights in Charlemagne&#x27;s court. He is a gentleman investigator/gunfighter who travels around the Old West working as a mercenary for people who hire him to solve their problems.

Like many Westerns, the television show was set in a time vaguely indicated to be some years after the American Civil War. The radio show announced the year of the story that followed in the opening of each episode.

The season-five television episode, &quot;A Drop of Blood&quot;, gives the specific date of July 3, 1879. In the 14th and 17th (&quot;Lazarus&quot;, March 6 and 7, 1875) episodes of season five, it is 1875.

==Characters==
===Paladin===

Paladin prefers to settle the difficulties clients bring his way without violence, but this rarely happens. When forced, he excels in fisticuffs. Under his real name, which is never revealed, he was a dueling champion of some renown. Paladin is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and a veteran of the American Civil War, in which he served as a Union cavalry officer. In the episode &quot;The Bostonian&quot;, he indirectly reveals he comes from Boston (or at least spent some time there), claiming, &quot;In my youth, . . I was the best-dressed bouncer in Scollay Square.&quot;

His permanent place of residence is the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco, where he lives the life of a successful businessman and &quot;&quot;, wearing elegant custom-made suits, consuming fine wine, playing the piano, and attending the opera and other cultural events. He is an expert chess player, poker player, and swordsman. He is skilled in Chinese martial arts, and is seen in several episodes receiving instruction and training with a kung ku master in San Francisco. He is highly educated, able to quote classic literature, philosophy, Scripture, and case law, and speaks several languages. He is also president of the San Francisco Stock Exchange Club.

When out working, Paladin changes into all-black Western-style clothing. His primary weapon is a custom-made, first-generation .45 caliber Colt Single Action Army Cavalry Model revolver with an unusual rifled barrel, carried in a black leather holster (with a platinum chess knight symbol facing the rear), hanging from a black leather gunbelt. He also carries a lever-action Marlin rifle (with a platinum chess knight symbol facing the rear seen in &quot;The Hunt&quot;) strapped to his saddle. In some episodes, he has a two-shot Remington derringer concealed under his belt; in other episodes, it is a single-shot Merrimack Arms &quot;Southerner&quot; derringer.

Paladin gives out a business card imprinted with &quot;Have Gun Will Travel&quot; and an engraving of a white knight chess piece, which evokes the proverbial and the knight in shining armor. Underneath the chess piece is the wording &quot;Wire Paladin&quot;, and under that, &quot;San Francisco&quot;. A closeup of this card is used as a title card between scenes in the program.

&quot;A Man Called Paladin&quot;, Frank C. Robertson&#x27;s novelization of the season-six premiere &quot;Genesis&quot;, gives Paladin&#x27;s real name as Clay Alexander.

===Other recurring characters===
The one other major semiregular character in the show is the Chinese bellhop at the Carlton Hotel, known as Hey Boy (real name Kim Chan or Kim Chang); in the first season in the episode called &quot;Hey Boy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, the character Hey Boy is sought by Paladin under the name Kim Chan, which is written on a piece of paper and shown on screen. As the episode continues, Hey Boy is referred to (verbally) five times as Kim Chan and then on the sixth incident Paladin states Hey Boy&#x27;s name as Kim Chang and thereafter he is referred to as Kim Chang every time. No explanation is given for the name change. 

Hey Boy is played by Kam Tong. According to author and historian Martin Grams Jr., Hey Boy is featured in all but the fourth of the show&#x27;s six seasons, with the character of Hey Girl, played by Lisa Lu, replacing Hey Boy for season four while Kam Tong worked on the &quot;Mr. Garlund&quot; television series. Lisa Lu had previously played Hey Boy&#x27;s sister, Kim Li, in &quot;Hey Boy&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

Character actor Olan Soule appears in 10 episodes across all six seasons of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; as an employee of the Carlton Hotel, usually identified as the manager/desk clerk. The character&#x27;s name is inconsistent, being given as &quot;Cartwright&quot; in two episodes, and &quot;Matthews&quot; in another. Tony Regan also appears as an unnamed desk clerk in over a dozen episodes, between seasons two and five. Hal Needham, later a noted director, worked on the show as a stunt performer and can be seen as a bit-part player (in a wide variety of roles) in nearly 50 episodes.

==Production==
&quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; was created by Sam Rolfe and Herb Meadow and produced by Frank Pierson, Don Ingalls, Robert Sparks, and Julian Claman. Of the 225 episodes of the television series, 24 were written by Gene Roddenberry. Other major contributors included Bruce Geller, Harry Julian Fink, Don Brinkley, and Irving Wallace. Andrew V. McLaglen directed 101 episodes, and 28 were directed by series star Richard Boone.

=== Filming locations ===
Unlike many Westerns, entire episodes were filmed outdoors and away from the Old West Street set on Irving Street just below Melrose Avenue, the home of Filmaster television production company. Filmaster was located across the street from, later becoming part of, Paramount Studios&#x27; backlot. The area is now enclosed in the independent Kingsley Productions studio lot encompassing a city block. Beginning in season four, filming locations were often given in the closing credits. Locations included Bishop and Lone Pine, California; an area now known as Paladin Estates between Bend and Sisters, Oregon; and the Abbott Ranch near Prineville, Oregon.

=== Writing ===
Many of the writers who worked on &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; went on to gain fame elsewhere. Gene Roddenberry created &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Bruce Geller created &quot;&quot;, Samuel A. Peeples created &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, &quot;Custer&quot;, and &quot;Lancer&quot;, and Harold Jack Bloom created Boone&#x27;s later series &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot; and the 1970s medical-adventure series &quot;Emergency!&quot; Harry Julian Fink is one of the writers who created &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (the opening title and theme scene of the 1973 &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; sequel &quot;Magnum Force&quot; features a &quot;Paladin&quot;-like sequence of a handgun being slowly cocked and then finally pointed toward the camera, with a potent line of dialogue). Sam Peckinpah wrote one episode, &quot;The Singer&quot;, which aired in 1958. Other notable writers who contributed an episode include Gene L. Coon, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, Laurence Heath, and Fred Freiberger. Both &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; were produced by Desilu Productions and later Paramount Television, which also now owns the rights to &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; through its successor company, CBS Television Distribution.

=== Music ===
The program&#x27;s opening was a four-note motif composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann. For the opening theme, Herrmann reused a short sequence he had previously composed for the 1951 movie &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;, starring Robert Ryan and Ida Lupino. The &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; theme (and fragments of incidental music also used in the television series) are featured in a chase scene across snowy fields; at the 35:25 mark of the film, the actual &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; opening theme is played in recognizable form, although the scoring is slightly different from the better-known television version.

The show&#x27;s closing song, &quot;The Ballad of Paladin&quot;, was written by Johnny Western (who had a role in season one, episode 35, &quot;The Return of Dr. Thackeray&quot;), Richard Boone, and program creator Sam Rolfe, and was performed by Western. In the first season, the closing song was a reprise of the opening theme. In syndication, the first (premise) episode concludes with the Johnny Western ballad. The rest of the first-season episodes play a reprise of the opening theme; although the theme song was used in closing at least four times in season one, including episodes 25, 30, 33, and 34.

In the second season, the song was the only closing music. In the third season, a new lyric was added to the five-line &quot;The Ballad of Paladin&quot;, making it six lines long. In 1962–1963, the final season, the song&#x27;s lyrics were cut to four lines, the original fourth and added sixth being dropped. This occurred because the production credits for writer, producer, and director were pulled from the closing credits to appear over the opening sequences. However, in the season-six episode &quot;Sweet Lady in the Moon&quot; (episode 26, 1963), the ballad was played complete over the closing credits.

Johnny Western has sung a fully recorded version, opening with the refrain and including a second verse never heard on the television series.

When showing episodes with Paladin at the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco, background music is often played. That instrumental was &quot;Darling Nelly Gray&quot;, which is a 19th-century popular song written and composed by Benjamin Hanby.

== Themes and analysis ==

=== Title ===
The title is a variation on a cliche used in personal advertisements in newspapers such as &quot;The Times&quot;, indicating that the advertiser (a job seeker) is equipped for a certain category of jobs and flexible about the location of the job. It has been used this way from the early 20th century.

A trope common in theatrical advertising at the time was &quot;Have tux, will travel&quot; (originally from comedian Bob Hope in 1954), and CBS has claimed this was the specific inspiration for the writer Herb Meadow. The television show popularized the phrase in the 1950s and 1960s, and many variations have been used as titles for other works, including the 1958 science-fiction novel &quot;Have Space Suit—Will Travel&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein.

=== Opening sequence ===
Originally, each show opened with the same 45-second visual. Over a slow, four-note-repeat backbeat score, a tight shot of Paladin&#x27;s chess knight emblem centered in a black background is seen, before the view widens to show the emblem affixed to Paladin&#x27;s holster, with Paladin in his trademark costume seen from waist level in profile. Then, as he draws his revolver from the holster, the four-note-repeat backbeat fades to a light, almost harp-like strumming. He cocks the hammer, and then rotates the gun to point the barrel at the viewer for ten seconds, often delivering a line of dialogue from the coming episode, after which the pistol is uncocked and holstered briskly. As the weapon is reholstered and the view tightens to show only the chess knight, again, the four-note-repeat backbeat returns.

As only the chess knight emblem in a black background is back, the name &quot;RICHARD BOONE&quot; appears across the screen for about five seconds. The name fades out and immediately the words &quot;in HAVE GUN – WILL TRAVEL&quot; fade in, again for about five seconds. Boone&#x27;s name and the show&#x27;s title are accompanied by a four-note &quot;stinger&quot; that overshadows the four-note-repeat. The &quot;stinger&quot; is roughly the same as that heard when Paladin&#x27;s business card is flashed on screen (in almost every episode). The words fade away after those five seconds, leaving only the chess knight emblem against the black background, and the four-note-repeat fades out. This opening then fades out and the show fades in on its opening scene.

A later version of the opening sequence (seasons three to six) has a long-range shot, with Paladin in a full-body profile silhouette, and he fast-draws the revolver, dropping into a slight crouch as he turns, pointing at the camera. After the dubbed-over line, he straightens as he shoves the firearm into his holster. This silhouette visual remained for the run of the series. In later episodes, the teaser line was dropped; as seen in many of the episodes of the final two seasons&#x27; opening titles, when Paladin crouches and points his gun at the camera, first &quot;RICHARD BOONE&quot;, and then &quot;HAVE GUN – WILL TRAVEL&quot; would appear as before, and Boone would reholster his gun as the words faded out. Due to the networks not always airing episodes in the order they were filmed, the omission of the voice-over dialogue was inconsistent for some of the episodes, as seen in the opening titles. Season six did have the most opening titles without the voice-over dialogue, especially as the season progressed, again as seen when the episodes opened.

==Franchise in other media==
===Radio show===

The &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; radio show broadcast 106 episodes on the CBS Radio Network between November 23, 1958, and November 27, 1960. It was one of the last radio dramas featuring continuing characters and one of only a handful of American radio adaptations of a television series. John Dehner (a regular on the radio series version of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;) played Paladin, and Ben Wright usually (but not always) played Hey Boy. Virginia Gregg played Miss Wong, Hey Boy&#x27;s girlfriend, before the television series featured the character of Hey Girl. Unlike the small-screen version, this medium usually had a tag scene at the Carlton at both the beginning and the end of the episode. Initially, the episodes were adaptations of the television program as broadcast earlier the same week, but eventually, original stories were produced, including a finale (&quot;From Here to Boston&quot;, &quot;Inheritance&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye, Paladin&quot;) in which Paladin leaves San Francisco, perhaps forever, to claim an inheritance back east. The radio version was written by producer/writer Roy Winsor.

===Books===
Three novels were based on the television show, all with the title of the show. The first was a hardback written for children, published by Whitman in 1959 in a series of novelizations of television shows. It was written by Barlow Meyers and illustrated by Nichols S. Firfires. The second was a 1960 paperback original, written for adults by Noel Loomis. The last book, &quot;A Man Called Paladin&quot;, written by Frank C. Robertson and published in 1963 by Collier-Macmillan in hardback and paperback, is based on the television episode &quot;Genesis&quot; by Frank Rolfe.

This novel is the only source wherein a name is given to the Paladin character, Clay Alexander, but fans of the series do not consider this name canonical. Dell Comics published a number of comic books with original stories based on the television series. In 2000, Martin Grams, Jr. and Les Rayburn self-published the 500-page trade paperback, &quot;The Have Gun – Will Travel Companion&quot;, documenting the history of the radio and television series.

===Film===
In 1997, a film version of the television series was announced. John Travolta was named as a possible star in the Warner Bros. production, which was scripted by Larry Ferguson and to be directed by &quot;The Fugitive&quot; director Andrew Davis. The film was never made.

In 2006, a &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; film starring rapper Eminem was announced to be in production, but the film does not hold an official confirmed release date. Paramount Pictures extended an 18-month option on the television series and planned to transform the character of Paladin into a modern-day bounty hunter. Eminem was expected to work on the soundtrack.

===Television reboot===
In August 2012, several venues announced that David Mamet was developing a reboot of the television series for CBS.

=== In other television series ===
In the television series &quot;Maverick&quot;, season two, episode 16, &quot;Gun Shy&quot;, a send-up of the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, Marshal Mort Dooley, the marshal of Elwood, Kansas, comments that several strange people have been passing through his town lately, specifically referring to &quot;that gunslinger who handed out business cards&quot;. A subsequent comedic &quot;Maverick&quot; episode titled &quot;The Cats of Paradise&quot; features a black-clad character obviously based on Paladin, albeit without using the name. Both episodes star James Garner.

In the 1962 &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon &quot;Tall in the Trap&quot;, Tom rolls into town on spurs with a card reading &quot;Tall in the Trap&quot; showing a mousetrap on a knight chess piece. In the third episode of the seventh season of &quot;Archer&quot; (&quot;Deadly Prep,&quot; April 14, 2016) the titular character is seen cleaning his weapon as he sings the theme song from &quot;Have Gun - Will Travel&quot;.

==Cultural influences== 
*&quot;Boon&quot;, a hit British Drama series, was heavily influenced by &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;. The series followed the adventures an ex-fireman who was invalided out of the service and became a modern-day hero. Of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;&#x27;s influence, co-creator Jim Hill said: &quot;&quot;Boon&quot; had been derived from an American TV series from the 1950s that Bill Stair and I both watched and liked. It was called &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; – a troubleshooting cowboy answered distress calls. He was called Paladin and was played by the actor Richard Boone. We dropped the E and we had BOON – a modern-day trouble shooter on a motorbike instead of a steed.&quot; &quot;Boon&quot; ran from 1986 to 1992, with a special one-off episode in 1995.
*The &quot;Have...Will...&quot; theme was used in the titles of several record albums, such as &quot;Have Trumpet, Will Excite!&quot; by jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie, &quot;Have Organ Will Swing&quot; by pianist/organist Buddy Cole, &quot;Have Organ Will Travel&quot; by organist George Wright, multiple albums named &quot;Have Guitar Will Travel&quot;, and others.
*In a scene in &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, the main characters sing the show&#x27;s closing theme song as a way of evoking that film&#x27;s era (it is set in late 1959); songwriter Johnny Western successfully sued the producers for not securing his permission beforehand. This scene is spoofed in the &quot;Stand by Me&quot; segment of the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Three Kings&quot;.
*The &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon &quot;Tall in the Trap&quot; (1962, directed by Gene Deitch) was a parody of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;.
*A feature of Frank Zappa&#x27;s 1970 tour&#x27;s performances was the &quot;Paladin Routine&quot;, a brief improvised comedy sketch based on the &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; characters, culminating in a vocalization of the music from the series&#x27; opening-credit sequence. One such performance is documented on the bootleg album &quot;Freaks &amp; Motherfu*#@%!&quot; (later released as part of &quot;Beat the Boots&quot;).
*In the third season, episode three of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, aired January 6, 2013, in what appears to be an anachronism, the character Lady Cora tells her husband, &quot;I&#x27;m American: have gun, will travel&quot;, but the general phrase &quot;Have X will travel&quot; does date back to the show&#x27;s time period.
*In the 1972–74 series &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, set in New Prospect, Oklahoma, in 1901, Boone is an older former gunfighter turned forensic criminologist. At one point, Ramsey denies that in his younger days as a gunfighter, he worked under the name Paladin. The origin of this myth is Boone&#x27;s remark in an interview, &quot;Hec Ramsey is Paladin – only fatter.&quot; Naturally, he merely meant the characters had certain similarities: Ramsey, for his part, was practically buffoonish, imparting a measure of humor to &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot; missing from the sterner, more erudite Paladin.
*In the two-part 1991 TV miniseries &quot;The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw&quot;, a poker game is played by the rules of &quot;the late Mr. Paladin&quot; in the Carlton Hotel where the recently deceased Paladin usually stayed; the film featured numerous cowboy actors from 1950s television series playing their earlier roles in cameo appearances three decades later, along with Claude Akins as President Theodore Roosevelt turning up at the game to assist in memorializing Paladin.
*In the 1985 &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Barbara Hambly, in which the &quot;Enterprise&quot; travels back in time, Spock plays chess against Paladin during a visit to San Francisco.
*In the 2013 fan-created series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot; episode &quot;Pilgrim of Eternity&quot;, visual effects artist Doug Drexler played the part of Paladin in a Holodeck creation. Drexler cited the special specifications of Paladin&#x27;s revolver to an impressed Captain Kirk (Vic Mignogna).
*Paying homage to Boone&#x27;s character, in the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot;, the Paladin features an archetype named &quot;Holy Gun&quot;, whose abilities are succinctly described as &quot;Have Gun&quot;.
*Desmond Bagley&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;The Vivero Letter&quot; has a moment when the protagonist/narrator, thinking about what he is getting into, ironically describes himself as an &quot;adventurer at large – &#x27;have gun, will travel&#x27;.&quot; Then he notes that he does not have a gun and said, &quot;I doubted whether I could use one effectively, anyway.&quot;
*&quot;Have Space Suit—Will Travel&quot; is a 1958 science fiction novel for young readers by American writer Robert A. Heinlein.
*The US Navy&#x27;s Strike Fighter Squadron 105 (VFA-105), nicknamed &quot;Gunslingers&quot;, wears a unit insignia featuring a western-style revolver in a holster emblazoned with a gold knight chess piece (although unlike Paladin&#x27;s holster, the horse faces forward).

==Τrademark infringement litigation==
In 1974, a rodeo performer named Victor De Costa won a federal court judgment against CBS for trademark infringement, successfully arguing that he had created the Paladin character and the ideas used in the show, and that CBS had used them without permission. For example, at his rodeo appearances he always dressed in black, called himself the &quot;Paladin&quot;, handed out hundreds of business cards featuring a chess piece logo along with the phrase &quot;Have gun will travel&quot;, and carried a concealed derringer pistol. A year later, an appellate court overturned the lower court ruling on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to prove that likelihood of confusion had existed in the minds of the public—a necessary requirement for a suit over trademark infringement. In 1977, De Costa was awarded a federal trademark for the Paladin character.

De Costa kept pursuing his legal options, and in 1991—more than 30 years after his first lawsuit was originally filed—a federal jury awarded DeCosta $3.5 million from Viacom International, by then a CBS subsidiary, which has distributed the show&#x27;s reruns in defiance of De Costa&#x27;s registered trademark, ordering Viacom to pay DeCosta $1 million for his loss and $2.5 million in punitive damages. Rhode Island District Judge Ernest C. Torres blocked the redistribution of the Paladin show by Viacom.

In 1992, the jury award was reversed. The United States Court of Appeals ruled that because Mr. DeCosta had unsuccessfully sued in the past over the same issues, &quot;the doctrine of &#x27;collateral estoppel&#x27; bars his new claims.&quot; In other words, he was not allowed a second attempt to try the old, previously settled dispute. See the final legal case: Victor DeCosta, v. VIACOM, 981 F.2d 602, 604 (1st Cir. 1992).

De Costa died on 29 January 1993 at the age of 84. In the end, he received nothing.

<text>Lloyd Lionel Gaines (born 1911 – disappeared March 19, 1939) was the plaintiff in &quot;Gaines v. Canada&quot; (1938), one of the most important early court cases in the 20th-century U.S. civil rights movement. After being denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law because he was African American, and refusing the university&#x27;s offer to pay for him to attend a neighboring state&#x27;s law school that had no racial restriction, Gaines filed suit. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled in his favor, holding that the separate but equal doctrine required that Missouri either admit him or set up a separate law school for black students.

The Missouri General Assembly chose the latter option. It authorized conversion of a former cosmetology school in St. Louis to establish the Lincoln University School of Law, to which other, mostly black, students were admitted. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had supported Gaines&#x27;s suit, planned to file another one challenging the adequacy of the new law school. While waiting for classes to begin, Gaines traveled between St. Louis, Kansas City and Chicago looking for work. He worked odd jobs and gave speeches before local NAACP chapters. One night in Chicago he left the fraternity house, where he was staying, to buy stamps, and never returned. He was never seen again by anyone who knew or recognized him and reported doing so.

Gaines&#x27;s disappearance was not noted immediately, since he frequently traveled independently and alone, without telling anyone his plans. Only in late 1939, when the NAACP&#x27;s lawyers were unable to locate him to take depositions for a rehearing in state court, did a serious search begin. It failed, and the suit was dismissed. While most of his family believed at the time that he had been killed in retaliation for his legal victory, there has been speculation that Gaines had tired of his role in the movement and gone elsewhere, either New York or Mexico City, to start a new life. In 2007 the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agreed to look into the case, among many other missing persons cold cases related to the civil rights era.

His unknown fate notwithstanding, Gaines has been honored by the University of Missouri School of Law and the state. The Black Culture Center at the University of Missouri and a scholarship at its law school are named for him and another black student initially denied admission. In 2006 Gaines was posthumously granted an honorary law degree. The state bar granted him a posthumous law license. A portrait of Gaines hangs in the University of Missouri law school building.

==Early life==
Born in 1911 in Water Valley, Mississippi, Gaines moved with his mother and siblings to St. Louis, Missouri in 1926 after the death of their father. Part of the Great Migration from rural communities in the South to industrial cities in the North, his family settled in the city&#x27;s Central West End neighborhood. Gaines did well academically, and was a valedictorian at Vashon High School.

After winning a $250 ($ in current dollars) scholarship in an essay contest, Gaines went to college. He graduated with honors and a bachelor&#x27;s in history from Lincoln University, a historically black college in Jefferson City, Missouri. It was the state&#x27;s segregated undergraduate institution for African Americans. 

To cover the gap between his scholarship and the college&#x27;s tuition, he sold magazines on the street. Gaines was elected as president of the senior class and a brother in the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Law school application==

Following his 1935 graduation, during the Great Depression, Gaines unsuccessfully sought work as a teacher. 

Around that time, NAACP lawyer Charles Hamilton Houston was looking for a plaintiff to bring a case challenging Missouri&#x27;s Jim Crow laws that restricted the University of Missouri to white students. He sent St. Louis lawyer Sidney Revels Redmond, one of three dozen African Americans then admitted to the Missouri bar, to visit the university&#x27;s Columbia campus, with instructions to take pictures of buildings that housed departments and courses of study not available at Lincoln University, and obtain admission forms.

In June 1935, Gaines had requested a catalog and admission form from Sy Woodson Canada, registrar, of the University of Missouri Law School. They were sent to his address at Lincoln in Jefferson City. By August he applied for admission, encouraged by Lorenzo Greene, a Lincoln University professor and veteran civil rights activist. Accounts vary as to whether Gaines did this on his own initiative or was encouraged by the NAACP, in order to have a plaintiff, without any interest in a legal career. When Redmond informed Houston that Gaines was willing to be a plaintiff, Houston initially asked for another candidate. Houston later accepted Gaines, when it became apparent he was the only available plaintiff, but never explained what his initial objections might have been.

At first Canada did not realize that Gaines was black, since the application form did not ask for prospective students to indicate their race. Only when he received Gaines&#x27; transcript from Lincoln University did he understand. He left Gaines&#x27;s application on his desk, without taking any action, although the young man was otherwise qualified for admission to the law school. Canada sent Gaines a telegram urging him to meet with the registrar to discuss &quot;further advice&quot; and &quot;possible arrangement&quot;. Gaines wrote both the president of Lincoln to ask what this meant, and to Frederick Middlebush, president of University of Missouri, requesting admission to the law school. Middlebush never replied.

==Lawsuit==

The official policy of Missouri was to pay the &quot;out of state&quot; expenses for education of African Americans who wished to study law until such time as demand was sufficient to build a separate law school within the state for them. At first Houston and Redmond hoped that the ruling in &quot;University of Maryland v. Murray&quot; (1936), which they had won when Maryland&#x27;s Court of Appeals invalidated a similar provision there, would persuade Missouri to allow Gaines to attend without legal resistance. They began planning security arrangements for him. 

They filed a writ of &quot;mandamus&quot; in January 1936 ordering that Gaines&#x27;s application be considered. When Middlebush asked the university&#x27;s board how it should respond, the lawyers recommended defending their policy. They adopted a resolution formally denying Gaines&#x27;s admission, arguing that segregated higher education was the public policy of the state, and that Gaines had the legal option of attending law school outside Missouri at the state&#x27;s expense.

With Gaines&#x27;s application formally denied, the &quot;mandamus&quot; petition was now moot. Houston and the NAACP filed another petition, &quot;State ex rel. Gaines v. Canada&quot;, arguing that the law school&#x27;s refusal to admit him on racial grounds was a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights. The university responded with the same points it had made in the board&#x27;s resolution. Further, it said that Gaines should have sued Lincoln to compel it to open a law school. Gaines and his lawyers argued in response that lawyers educated out of state lost the benefit of courses that were specific to Missouri law, as well as the connections and firsthand experience of the state&#x27;s courts that were gained by an in-state legal education. 

The NAACP did not expect to overturn the &quot;separate but equal&quot; standard set by the US Supreme Court&#x27;s 1896 &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; decision, which allowed states to impose legal racial segregation, but to undermine it by requiring states that had segregated education to provide the &quot;equal&quot; part of the ruling. They targeted graduate and professional public institutions of higher learning. Unlike most other segregated facilities, these were few in number and under centralized state control. They expected that if the court ruled in their favor, segregationist states would realize they had to choose between the expense of developing duplicates of such institutions for a small group of African Americans and integrating existing facilities, and that those states would pragmatically choose the latter. Houston believed that, since such graduate schools served small portions of the population, attempts to integrate them would incite less public opposition than efforts to integrate public elementary and secondary schools. Lastly, judges had been educated in law schools and could be expected to understand the adverse effects of inequalities on students. 

Houston and the other NAACP attorneys were encouraged in this strategy by their victory in &quot;Murray&quot;, two years earlier. In Missouri, the racial bar to attendance was by state law rather than administrative regulation. The NAACP hoped to get the US Supreme Court to hear the case and establish a precedent.

===Trial===

Houston, Redmond and Gaines drove to Columbia, Missouri for the July 1936 trial at Boone County Courthouse. They arrived as the courthouse was beginning to open for the morning. Due to that summer&#x27;s severe heat and drought, many of the white farmers from surrounding communities were there, waiting to apply for financial relief. Some went into the courtroom to take in the unusual sight, at that time, of African-American lawyers arguing a case.

They were joined by a hundred current University of Missouri law students, reporters, and a few local African Americans. Two recent local lynchings had discouraged most of the local black community from attending, although local NAACP chapters tried to encourage attendance. African Americans sat among the whites, since the courtroom facilities were not segregated. The lawyers for both sides shared a table, and shook hands before the case.

By the time the trial began, the heat outside already exceeded . The crowds and poor ventilation made it even hotter in the courtroom. Judge W.M. Dinwiddie suggested to the lawyers that he and they remove their jackets. 

During his opening arguments, Houston reiterated that Gaines&#x27;s exclusion from the law school solely on racial grounds violated his constitutional rights. Representing the state, William Hogsett conceded in his argument that Gaines was an excellent and qualified student with a right to a legal education, as long as it was somewhere other than the state university&#x27;s law school. He noted that racial segregation was public policy of the state, codified in the constitution and laws enacted by its legislature elected by the people, which prohibited African-American students from attending University of Missouri law school.

Presentation of witnesses began with Gaines testifying on his own behalf that he wished to attend Missouri&#x27;s law school because of its quality. He did not want to attend law school out of state, even at the state&#x27;s expense, because Columbia was more convenient to his home in St. Louis than the law schools of neighboring states&#x27; universities. And at one of those schools, he would not be as able to develop the expertise in Missouri law necessary to practice in the state as he would be at Missouri&#x27;s law school.

On cross-examination, Hogsett suggested that Gaines was interested in applying to law school only to act as a plaintiff in this lawsuit, pressing Gaines on when he had contacted the NAACP after he had learned that his application had been denied. Had he ever seen a black student attending the university? Why had he refused, in an earlier deposition, to answer a question about whether he would have been interested in attending a hypothetical Lincoln law school? Gaines conceded that some of the out-of-state law schools were closer to St. Louis than Columbia, and cost less to travel to, per evidence the state introduced, but noted that students there were not compelled to choose them. Hogsett concluded by asking Gaines if he was aware that black students were not accepted at Missouri&#x27;s law school when he applied; Gaines said he had not been.

Houston next called law school dean William Masterton to the stand as a hostile witness. Masterson denied that there was any special benefit to attending the law school for a student interested in Missouri law in particular, since the other law schools Gaines could have attended all used the same casebook as Missouri. He maintained this position even when Houston reminded him that the school&#x27;s law review had a stated editorial policy of publishing one article in every issue that addressed an issue specific to Missouri. Houston showed him the Iowa law school&#x27;s catalog, which touted the benefits of attending for a student interested in practicing law in Iowa. On cross-examination, Masterson claimed not to know details of the admissions process or the school&#x27;s budget, and could not answer Houston&#x27;s question as to whether or not Missouri&#x27;s was the only public law school in the state. 

Other state and university officials took the stand, with both sides using their testimony to buttress their cases. Canada told Houston that to his knowledge black students were the only ones barred from the university on account of their race; the university&#x27;s assistant secretary added later that the school not only admitted students from overseas but extended financial aid to them if necessary. Robert Witherspoon, an African-American lawyer who practiced in St. Louis, testified that having had to attend law school out of state had put him at a disadvantage.

State Senator F.M. McDavid, chair of the state&#x27;s Board of Regents, testified on direct examination that the admission of a black student would be very disruptive for the university and its students, undermining a hundred years of tradition. Houston asked on cross if he really believed that that tradition &quot;could bind progress forever.&quot; McDavid also worried that it would be &quot;very unhappy&quot; for Gaines. But when Houston asked him also if he was aware of any problems caused by the admission of a black student at Maryland following that lawsuit, McDavid said he was not, as he had not researched the issue.

Hogsett presented his case for the audience, some of whom nodded in sympathy with his arguments, while Houston concentrated on getting facts in the record for appeal, hopefully to the U.S. Supreme Court, the only venue where he expected and wanted to prevail. Two weeks later Dinwiddie held for the state, without writing an opinion. Gaines appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court.

===Appeals===

====Missouri Supreme Court====

The state&#x27;s highest court heard the arguments near the end of the year. While normally it sat in two divisions, the case was considered so important that all seven justices were present. Two months later, it upheld Judge Dinwiddie. 

In his opinion for a unanimous court, Justice William Francis Frank conceded that the state&#x27;s constitution&#x27;s provision requiring that its public schools be racially segregated did not explicitly extend to higher education. But that did not mean the legislature was barred from making such a prohibition. Despite language in one statute, which Gaines had relied on, saying that the university was open to &quot;all youths&quot; of the state, the legislature had gone to great lengths to create Lincoln and differentiate between white and black colleges.

Citing both &quot;Plessy&quot; and his own court&#x27;s prior holdings, Frank reiterated that this segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment: &quot;The right of a state to separate the races for the purpose of education is no longer an open question.&quot; He also rejected a due process argument, that Gaines had been unconstitutionally deprived of his proprietary interest in the university as a citizen and taxpayer of Missouri. &quot;[E]quality and not identity of school advantages is what the law guarantees to every citizen, white or black.&quot;

Frank addressed the only remaining question, whether, as Gaines alleged, his legal education out of state would have been the equal of that he could have received at Missouri&#x27;s law school. He accepted the law school&#x27;s evidence about its non-specialization in the state&#x27;s law and similarities in its curriculum to the neighboring state&#x27;s law schools. As for the distance involved, some of those schools, such as Illinois&#x27;s, were closer to St. Louis than Columbia would be for residents of Caruthersville, in the state&#x27;s southeastern Bootheel. And if Gaines were to attend school outside the state, the state would subsidize his living expenses while he did, costs he would have to bear himself if he went to Missouri.

Lastly, Frank distinguished Gaines&#x27;s case from &quot;Murray&quot; by noting that that state&#x27;s Court of Appeals had found that Maryland had made no provisions for establishing a law school for black students and did not financially support those who attended law school out of state, unlike Missouri. He believed that the construction of a law school for blacks at Lincoln would satisfy Gaines&#x27;s desires if he could wait.

====U.S. Supreme Court====

Houston and Redmond successfully petitioned to the United States Supreme Court for &quot;certiorari&quot;. Now known as &quot;Gaines v. Canada&quot;, the case was argued in November 1938. Houston said the state&#x27;s offer to pay for Gaines to attend law school out of state could not guarantee him a legal education equal to that offered white students at Missouri.

A month later a 6-2 majority ordered the State of Missouri either to admit Gaines to the University of Missouri School of Law or to provide another school of equal stature within the state borders. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for the majority:

The case articulated an important rule of law in the sequence of NAACP cases leading to the eventual order for desegregation of public schools: that &quot;any&quot; academic program that a state provided to whites had to have an equivalent available to blacks. The &quot;Gaines&quot; holding helped the NAACP lay the foundation for the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark 1954 ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, holding that separate facilities for public schools were inherently unequal and ordering such schools to be desegregated, thus overturning &quot;Plessy&quot;.

Since the Supreme Court had ordered the Missouri Supreme Court to rehear the case in light of its ruling, Gaines&#x27;s legal battle was not over. Historian Gary Lavergne describes Gaines during this period as &quot;&quot;: he sought media attention, then complained about how stressful it was being the center of that attention. Heman Marion Sweatt, later the plaintiff in another desegregation case heard by the Supreme Court, worked with Gaines at the University of Michigan. The NAACP had paid for him to attend graduate school there and Sweatt reportedly found Gaines &quot;rather arrogant&quot;.

After working as a clerk for the Works Progress Administration in Michigan and completing his master&#x27;s in economics, Gaines returned to Missouri in anticipation of the proceedings there, set to begin in August. The Missouri legislature hastily passed a bill appropriating $275,000 ($ in current dollars) to convert an old beauty school in St. Louis into the new Lincoln University School of Law, in the hope that would satisfy the court. The NAACP planned to challenge the establishment of the new law school as still inadequate compared to the resources of the existing University of Missouri School of Law.

Gaines, who would need to pay his law school tuition as well as his daily living expenses, looked for work in the meantime. Between the continuing Depression and segregation, he had to settle for work at a gas station. He gave speeches to local NAACP chapters and church groups while seeking donations, telling them &quot;I am ready, willing and able to enroll in the law department at the University of Missouri in September, and I have the fullest intention of doing so,&quot; but he still had to borrow money from his brother George for everyday expenses.

Gaines quit the job at the gas station when he discovered the owner was purposely mislabeling low-grade fuel as high-grade. He feared getting caught in the legal consequences should the fraud be discovered. After taking a train across the state to Kansas City to give a speech to the local NAACP chapter and look, unsuccessfully, for work, he boarded another train for Chicago. There he reunited with the Page family, friends and neighbors from his youth in the Central West End. He stayed at a local YMCA.

==Disappearance==
Over the next several weeks, Gaines looked for work and visited with the Pages. While he maintained at public appearances that he was determined to continue his court case until its end and to attend the University of Missouri School of Law, in private he was becoming increasingly ambivalent. His mother later said that he had decided not to go, as they both believed it was &quot;too dangerous.&quot; Nancy Page later recalled asking Gaines directly about this. &quot;His answer wasn&#x27;t straightforward, and if I remember correctly, he said something like this: &#x27;If I don&#x27;t go, I will have at least made it possible for some other boy or girl to go.&#x27;&quot;

In his last letter to his mother, dated March 3, Gaines wrote:
Gaines had begun his letter by telling his mother that he had gone to Chicago &quot;hoping to find it possible to make my own way.&quot; He ended with &quot;Should I forget to write for a time, don&#x27;t worry about it. I can look after myself OK.&quot;

Gaines also wrote that his accommodations at the YMCA were paid through March 7, and that if he stayed in Chicago beyond that date, he would have to make &quot;other arrangements&quot;. After that, brothers at an Alpha Phi Alpha house took him in. He continued to have dinner at the Pages&#x27; home.

Nancy Page said that Gaines had told her he had taken a job at a department store. A reporter later found that although he had been hired, Gaines never reported for what would have been his first day of work. In the last days that she had contact with Gaines, Page said he seemed &quot;to be running away from something&quot;. Gaines&#x27;s family members and descendants believe he—and possibly the family as a whole—had received death threats. Given their background in rural Mississippi, where they knew of lynchings, they would have been too fearful to report such threats to the police.

Gaines&#x27;s financial woes continued. The Alpha Phi Alpha brothers took up a collection for him. Gaines promised the Pages that he would repay their generosity by taking them out to dinner on the night of March 19 but he never got the chance to do so. Earlier that evening, Gaines told the house attendant at Alpha Phi Alpha that he was going out to buy stamps, although the weather was cold and wet. Gaines never returned, and no one ever reported seeing him again.

==Aftermath==
Gaines had left a duffel bag filled with clothing at the fraternity house when he disappeared. Since he had had a history of leaving for days at a time with little or no notice to his friends and family, and often kept to himself, his absence seemed unremarkable at first. No one reported him missing to the police in either Chicago or St. Louis.

Several months later, people became aware that he was missing. In August, Houston and Sidney Redmond went looking for Gaines, as they had begun to argue his case at the Missouri Supreme Court&#x27;s rehearing. They could not locate him. Redmond said later that the Gaines family was neither concerned nor very helpful in trying to do so. The Lincoln University School of Law in St. Louis opened in late September, and pickets denounced it as a segregationist sham. Thirty students had been admitted to the first year and they arrived for classes, but Gaines was not among them. Since only Gaines had been denied admission to the University of Missouri School of Law, only he had standing to pursue the case before the Supreme Court of Missouri. The case could not proceed without him.

Near the end of 1939, the NAACP began a frantic effort to find Gaines. There were rumors that he had been killed or committed suicide, or that he had been paid to disappear and was living in Mexico City or teaching school in New York. The story received widespread media attention, and Gaines&#x27;s photograph was published in newspapers across the country, with a plea for anyone with information to contact the NAACP. No credible leads were received. In his 1948 memoir, NAACP president Walter White said, &quot;He [Gaines] has been variously reported in Mexico, apparently supplied with ample funds, and in other parts of North America.&quot;

Lavergne notes that Houston, Marshall, and Redmond never publicly called for an investigation of Gaines&#x27;s disappearance or said that they believed he had met with foul play. Since extrajudicial abductions and murders of African Americans who challenged segregation were not unheard of at the time, and the three lawyers frequently spoke out and demanded investigations when they believed such events had occurred, he thinks that they had no such evidence in Gaines&#x27; case. He suggests that they believed that Gaines, whom they knew had grown resentful of the NAACP and his role in the lawsuit, had purposely dropped out of sight. Fifty years later, near the end of his own career as a Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall recalled the case in terms that suggest this assessment: &quot;The sonofabitch just never contacted us again.&quot;

In January 1940, the state of Missouri moved to dismiss the case due to the absence of the plaintiff. Houston and Redmond did not oppose the motion, and it was granted.

==Investigations==
No law enforcement agency of the era formally investigated Gaines&#x27;s disappearance; it had not been reported to any, and many African Americans distrusted the police. J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who was more concerned about potential communist influence on the civil rights movement, wrote in an internal memo in 1940 that he did not believe the case fell under the FBI&#x27;s jurisdiction.

With the onset of World War II, other concerns displaced the Gaines case for most of the 1940s. Later the FBI released a 1970 letter from Hoover to an unidentified member of the public, thanking them for their interest in the case but reiterating his position from 30 years earlier that he did not believe the FBI had any jurisdiction to investigate. Two media outlets looked into the case, a half-century apart: &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine, in the 1950s, and &quot;The Riverfront Times&quot; of St. Louis, in the 2000s.

===&quot;Ebony&quot;===
&quot;Ebony&quot; reporter Edward T. Clayton revisited Gaines and his disappearance in 1951; the &quot;Times&quot; described his article as the most thorough investigation of the case. Clayton retraced Gaines&#x27;s movements in the months between the Supreme Court ruling and his trip to Chicago. Many persons who knew Gaines were still alive, such as family members in St. Louis and fraternity brothers in Chicago, and Clayton interviewed them.

Clayton found little new information. He drew a fuller portrait of Gaines that revealed the young man&#x27;s disillusionment with his activist path. Callie Gaines, bedridden in her attic, shared her last conversation with her son. She said that both of them realized that he would not be following through and enrolling in the University of Missouri School of Law. She said that he had sent her a final postcard saying, &quot;Goodbye. If you don&#x27;t hear from me anymore you know I&#x27;ll be all right.&quot; She had heard all the rumors about him turning up in Mexico or New York. &quot;But nobody knows any more than we do.&quot; One of his sisters believed he was still alive. The family has never sought to have him declared legally dead.

Gaines&#x27;s brother George, who had continued to loan his brother spending money at that time, said that when he disappeared, Gaines had owed him $500. He expressed bitterness that the NAACP had, in his opinion, exploited his brother. &quot;That organization—the N-A-A-C-P or whatever it was—had him going around here making speeches,&quot; George Gaines told Clayton, &quot;but when he got ready to go to Kansas City, I had to let him have $10 so he could get himself a white shirt.&quot; Sidney Redmond agreed that the Gaines family &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem too much concerned—and never was as I recall&quot; about finding him, due to their resentment of the NAACP&#x27;s role in pushing Lloyd Gaines into the public eye without adequately providing for or protecting him.

George provided Clayton with Lloyd&#x27;s letters home, including the last one, written almost two weeks before he disappeared, in which he had lamented what he felt was a lack of support from fellow African Americans and said he wished he were just a regular, unknown person again. Like the postcard, it concludes by implying that he might be out of touch for a while.

In Chicago, Clayton talked to the Alpha Phi Alpha brothers among whom Gaines had spent his last known days and the Pages, his family friends from St. Louis. The former could offer little beyond clarifying the precise date of his disappearance and the duffel bag of dirty laundry he had left behind. Two who claimed Gaines had sent them postcards from Mexico were unable to corroborate their accounts by producing the postcards.

The Pages shared the details of Gaines&#x27;s increasingly anxious state of mind in March 1939. Nancy Page said she had not inquired closely, out of respect for his privacy, but could tell something was bothering him. She reported a conversation with Gaines in which he was at best ambivalent about continuing the legal case and attending the University of Missouri School of Law. Clayton learned from her that Gaines had accepted a job, and found through his own research that Gaines had never started work there.

===&quot;The Riverfront Times&quot;===
In 2007 &quot;The Riverfront Times&quot;, St Louis&#x27;s alternative weekly newspaper, revisited the case, well over 60 years after Gaines&#x27;s disappearance. By that time Gaines had received posthumous honors. The FBI had accepted the case as the oldest of nearly a hundred civil-rights era disappearances referred to it for investigation by the NAACP. His immediate family and all others who had worked or socialized with him during that time had died. Reporter Chad Garrison spoke with George Gaines, a nephew of Lloyd&#x27;s, and other, younger descendants. George was one of two surviving family members who had been alive when Lloyd disappeared, although he had only been an infant.

George Gaines said his family rarely spoke of Lloyd during his childhood in the 1940s, but when they did it was usually in positive terms. &quot;Lloyd was always held in high regard as a person who set a positive example and stood up for what was right&quot;, he recalled. He had assumed that his uncle had died. He did not learn until reading the &quot;Ebony&quot; article that his uncle&#x27;s fate was unknown.

While Garrison did not find any new facts about the disappearance itself or Gaines&#x27;s time in Chicago, he found more direct evidence that Gaines might have fled to Mexico and lived out his life there. Sid Reedy, a University City librarian who had been an Alpha Phi Alpha brother at Lincoln University, told Garrison that he became fascinated by the case in the late 1970s. Reedy had sought out Lorenzo Greene, Gaines&#x27;s mentor at Lincoln University and an esteemed civil rights activist and intellectual. Greene told Reedy that while on a visit to Mexico City in the late 1940s, he had made contact with Lloyd Gaines.

Greene, who died in 1988, claimed to have spoken on the telephone several times with Gaines, whose voice he recognized instantly. The two made plans to have dinner together, but Gaines did not show up. Greene told Reedy that Gaines had indeed &quot;grown tired of the fight ... He had some business in Mexico City and apparently did well financially.&quot;

Garrison reported that Greene&#x27;s son, Lorenzo Thomas Greene, said his father also told him of the encounter; the older man always hoped Gaines would return. But because of his experience with the FBI while active in the civil-rights movement during those years, Greene did not report his telephone contact with Gaines. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a lot of trust there,&quot; said the son. &quot;Even if my father went to them with that information, I really don&#x27;t think they would have cared.&quot;

Some of Gaines&#x27;s relatives were willing to accept that he lived out his life in Mexico, as opposed to the alternative scenarios. &quot;It&#x27;s better than being buried in a basement somewhere—Jimmy Hoffa style,&quot; said Paulette Mosby-Smith, one of Gaines&#x27;s great-nieces. Others believe that would have been against his nature. &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that he went to Mexico and accepted a big payoff,&quot; George Gaines told Garrison. &quot;That&#x27;s not the same man who presented himself during the trial. I don&#x27;t believe he would compromise his integrity like that.&quot; Another great-niece, Tracy Berry, who graduated from law school and became a federal prosecutor, agrees:

She has since told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that she believes her great-uncle was murdered.

==Legacy and honors==
Although the family never had Lloyd Gaines declared legally dead, they erected a monument to him in 1999 in a Missouri cemetery. &quot;His legacy didn&#x27;t so much make me want to go to law school,&quot; says Tracy Berry. &quot;But I think he did instill the legacy of education in our family. It&#x27;s expected that you go to college. He started the fight that made it all possible.&quot;

In a December 1939 editorial, the &quot;Louisville Defender&quot;, that city&#x27;s African-American newspaper, wrote: 
&quot;[W]hether Gaines has been bribed, intimidated or worse, should certainly have little permanent effect on the struggle for equal rights and social justice in connection with Negro education in the South ... [where] Negroes are already hammering upon the doors of graduate schools hitherto closed to them, with increasing persistence.&quot;

Thurgood Marshall later said, &quot;I remember the &quot;Gaines&quot; case as one of our greatest legal victories.&quot; He had argued &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; before the Supreme Court and was later that body&#x27;s first African-American justice. He went on, &quot;But I have never lost the pain of having so many people spend so much time and money on him, just to have him disappear.&quot;

Lavergne has noted that the &quot;Gaines&quot; ruling by the US Supreme Court &quot;[made] constitutional compliance in the absence of integration difficult to achieve,&quot; even though the issue was not forced at the Missouri Supreme Court, and the separate but equal doctrine was not directly challenged. He cited three aspects of the Supreme Court decision to this point:

*First, the Court held that Gaines&#x27;s right was &quot;a personal and individual one.&quot; Gaines was entitled to go to law school regardless of how little demand there was in Missouri by African Americans for legal education.
*Second, the state could not meet its constitutional burden by sending students out of state. &quot;With &quot;Gaines&quot;, the idea of using out-of-state scholarships to meet the test of separate but equal legally ended forever and everywhere in the United States,&quot; Lavergne says.
*Third, &quot;the Court said that the promise of future equality ... did not make temporary discrimination constitutional.&quot;

Houston had hoped the effect of similar court rulings giving segregationist states a choice between full integration or duplication of programs for students of different races would lead many of them to choose the less expensive former option. But without Gaines, he could not carry through the next stage of his plan in the Missouri Supreme Court.

In the short term, the abrupt dismissal of the case forced by Gaines&#x27;s disappearance was a setback for efforts to legally challenge segregation. After having spent $25,000 ($ in current dollars) on the case, the NAACP had no money left. It could not support new plaintiffs, who were already difficult to find in the depressed economy. By the mid-1950s, the state closed Lincoln University School of Law, the only tangible result of the case, due to lack of students.

Houston was ill with the tuberculosis that would end his life a decade later. He resigned from the NAACP to return to private practice; Thurgood Marshall took over for him. In the first five years after the war, the NAACP found more plaintiffs and challenged segregationist policies in public graduate schools with cases such as &quot;Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.&quot;, &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;. The University of Missouri School of Law, bowing to pressure from the student body, finally admitted its first African-American student in 1951. Three years later the desegregation effort climaxed with &quot;Brown&quot;, overturning &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; and the separate but equal doctrine.

===At University of Missouri===
In the years after &quot;Brown&quot;, when desegregation became a reality but tensions persisted and implementation proved difficult, Gaines&#x27;s story became a cautionary tale at the University of Missouri. In a 2004 paper, LeeAnn Whites, a professor of Civil War history at the school, repeated a version in which Gaines had been on his way to enroll at the school as an undergraduate and had disappeared from a train traveling across the state, with the implication that he was murdered. Gerald M. Boyd, a St. Louis native and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who was one of a few hundred black students at the University of Missouri in the early 1970s, recalls hearing Gaines&#x27;s story early in his time there. He was also confronted by open displays of racial prejudice, such as the university&#x27;s &quot;Confederate Rock.&quot; &quot;Whatever his fate,&quot; Boyd wrote in his memoirs, &quot;in the eyes of blacks, the university bore the brunt of the blame.&quot; 
The University of Missouri, and particularly the University of Missouri School of Law, began recognizing Gaines near the end of the 20th century, despite his never having been admitted. It established a scholarship in his name in 1995. In 2001, the school&#x27;s African-American center was named for Gaines and another African American who had legally challenged the school&#x27;s color bar early in the 20th century. A portrait of Gaines hangs in a prominent public place in the law school building.

In 2006 the law school posthumously awarded Gaines an honorary degree in law. The Supreme Court of Missouri, which had denied Gaines&#x27;s admission almost 70 years before, and the state bar association, granted him an honorary posthumous law license. If Gaines were still alive and had reappeared (he would have turned 95 in 2006), he might have used those awards to practice law in Missouri.

<doc id="317498" wikidata="Q5492167" url="?curid=317498" title="The Robots of Death">
<text>The Robots of Death is the fifth serial of the 14th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 29 January to 19 February 1977.

In the serial, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and Leela (Louise Jameson) arrive on a sandminer whose crew, from a robot-dependent civilisation, are being murdered.

Influenced by the works of Agatha Christie, Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert, &quot;The Robots of Death&quot; was the second script written for the series by Chris Boucher, Philip Hinchcliffe&#x27;s penultimate story as producer and Michael E. Briant&#x27;s final contribution to the series as a director. It has been described by &quot;Radio Times&quot; as a &quot;fan favourite&quot;, &quot;suspenseful&quot; serial featuring Tom Baker &quot;in his prime&quot;. The design has been regarded as &quot;sumptuous&quot;, with strong silhouettes in the costumes, designed by Elizabeth Waller, and wealth of detail in the art direction. It was chosen to represent the era of the Fourth Doctor at the British Film Institute&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Plot==
The Fourth Doctor and Leela arrive in the TARDIS inside &quot;Storm Mine 4&quot;, a large sand-crawling mining vehicle used to gather valuable minerals that are brought to the surface of a desert planet by powerful sandstorms. They find the vehicle has a minimal human crew that oversee the menial work done by numerous robots, which are divided into three classes: dark-green-coloured &quot;Dum&quot; robots that cannot speak, gold-green-coloured &quot;Voc&quot; robots that can interact with the human crew, and a silver-coloured &quot;Super Voc&quot; robot, SV7, who manages the other robots.

The Doctor and Leela arrived shortly after the discovery of the corpse of one of the human crew, meteorologist Chub, recently murdered. The Doctor offers to help to find the murderer and prove their innocence. During the search, Leela comes across D84, a Dum who is secretly a Super Voc who is able to speak. The investigation is cut short when two more of the crew, Kerrill and Cass, are found killed, and the Doctor and Leela are secured in the robot repair section. However, crew member Poul is doubtful of the Doctor&#x27;s or Leela&#x27;s involvement, and when Poul finds Commander Uvanov standing over the corpse of yet another victim, he allows them to go free, convinced that Uvanov was guilty.

The vehicle&#x27;s engines go out of control, threatening the crew, and they find the ship&#x27;s engineer Borg appears to be another murder victim. The Doctor helps to regulate the engines to get them out of danger, while an engineer called Dask stays behind to repair the damage to the controls. The Doctor and Leela continue to investigate the murders, with the Doctor convinced one of the robots is behind it. Leela takes him to meet D84, and D84 explains that he and Poul were planted on the vehicle as a precautionary measure against a robot revolution that may be initiated by Taren Capel, a scientist that had been raised by robots and with delusions of power. D84 joins them to search the vehicle, and they discover a secret laboratory where the other robots have been reprogrammed to kill humans. Suspecting that Taren is aboard, the Doctor requests all the humans to meet them on the bridge. Poul, however, having discovered a damaged robot in the repair shop with a bloody left hand, realizes that the robots are responsible for the murders, goes mad, and shelters in the shop.

However, Dask refuses, and reveals himself as Taren; he shuts down all of the robots except those he had reprogrammed (excluding D84), and orders SV7 to start hunting down the remaining humans. As D84 retrieves Poul, the Doctor and Leela return to the robot repair section, and find the damaged robot with Borg&#x27;s blood on it; the Doctor surmises that Borg had been strong enough to put up a struggle against his robot assassin, and that this discovery had driven Poul insane. The Doctor uses the spare parts to construct a deactivator that will shut down all robots in close range, and then instructs Leela to hide with a canister of helium gas to use when Taren returns.

Taren is lured to the laboratory by the Doctor and D84, however D84 sacrifices himself to use the deactivator to shut down the Voc guard in the laboratory and itself. When SV7 arrives to kill the remaining humans, Taren begins to give SV7 orders to kill the Doctor, but the helium released by Leela causes Taren&#x27;s voice to become high-pitched and unrecognisable by SV7. The Super Voc then kills him. The Doctor helps to shut down SV7 and revert Taren&#x27;s programming. After ensuring that Poul and the others are safe and help is on the way, the Doctor and Leela take their leave.

==Production==
Early titles for the script included &quot;Planet of the Robots&quot; and &quot;The Storm-mine Murders&quot;.

The treatment of robots in this serial has many intentional nods to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics. The villain of the story is named Taren Capel, which is a reference to Karel Čapek, who is credited with first coining the word &quot;robot&quot;. Uvanov&#x27;s name is a reference to Isaac Asimov, while Poul is a reference to the science fiction writer Poul Anderson. The script several times refers to Robophobia (the irrational fear of robots) as &#x27;Grimwade&#x27;s Syndrome&#x27;, an inside joke reference to Peter Grimwade, a production assistant who directed some of the filmed scenes in the episode. Grimwade had frequently lamented that he was always working on material involving robots.

The sandminer was derived from &quot;Dune&quot;.

===Cast notes===

Russell Hunter was allegedly cast against the intention of the script, which implied that Commander Uvanov should be a physically imposing man, much in the mould of an eighteenth-century sailing master. David Collings, who plays Poul, previously appeared as Vorus in &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; and would later appear as Mawdryn in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; as well as an alternative incarnation of the Doctor in the Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who Unbound&quot; audio drama &quot;Full Fathom Five&quot;. Pamela Salem, who plays Toos, had provided voice work in the preceding story &quot;The Face of Evil&quot; and would later appear as Professor Rachel Jensen in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;. Salem had been one of the actresses considered for the part of Leela. David Bailie went on to play the Celestial Toymaker in the audio plays &quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot; and &quot;Solitaire&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
Episodes 1 &amp; 2 and Episodes 3 &amp; 4 were combined into two 50-minute episodes for repeat on 31 December 1977 and 1 January 1978, reaching 10.0 and 7.0 million viewers respectively.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), called the script &quot;one of the best ever&quot; and praised how it was enhanced by the design, acting, and direction. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker expressed similar praise, describing it as a &quot;true classic&quot; and praising the Art Deco design. In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; observed a few production errors but overall praised the design and voices of the robots and the score. He also called the story &quot;extraordinary&quot;, despite there being a coldness between Baker and Jameson that made it to the screen. &quot;DVD Talk&quot;″s Ian Jane was less positive, giving the story three and a half out of five stars. He found the plot &quot;a fairly standard murder mystery&quot; but still &quot;a good amount of fun&quot;, and praised Baker and Jameson. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 recommended &quot;The Robots of Death&quot;, remarking that &quot;it might be becoming my favorite classic &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story&quot;. In &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded it ten out of ten, writing &quot;fabulous design work, hugely suspenseful music and a very believable scenario make this one of the programme&#x27;s most durable tales. The killer may be obvious, but the tension is wrung out to the bitter end.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in May 1979. This novelisation was the shortest and notable for featuring the character of Cass attending a meeting after being murdered in the previous chapter.

===Home media===
This story was released on VHS in omnibus format in April 1986 and in episodic format in February 1995. It was released on DVD on 13 November 2000. A special edition of the DVD, with new bonus features, was released in the UK on 13 February 2012 in the third of the ongoing &quot;Revisitations&quot; DVD box sets.

<text>Introspection is the examination of one&#x27;s own conscious thoughts and feelings. In psychology, the process of introspection relies on the observation of one&#x27;s mental state, while in a spiritual context it may refer to the examination of one&#x27;s soul. Introspection is closely related to human self-reflection and self-discovery and is contrasted with external observation.

It generally provides a privileged access to one&#x27;s own mental states, not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual experience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of mental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so forth.

Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years. The philosopher Plato asked, &quot;…why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?&quot; While introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is perhaps best known for its role in epistemology; in this context introspection is often compared with perception, reason, memory, and testimony as a source of knowledge.

==In psychology==

===Wundt===
It has often been claimed that Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology, was the first to adopt introspection to experimental psychology though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten or Johann Nicolaus Tetens. Also, Wundt&#x27;s views on introspection must be approached with great care. Wundt was influenced by notable physiologists, such as Gustav Fechner, who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human sensory organs. Building upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt believed the method of introspection was the ability to observe an experience, not just the logical reflection or speculations which some others interpreted his meaning to be. Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the University of Leipzig, making it possible for other scientists to replicate his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, peer-reviewed scientific discipline. Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions: &quot;1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality&quot;.

===Titchener===
Edward Titchener was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt. After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to Cornell University, where he established his own laboratory and research. When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt&#x27;s ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt&#x27;s ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the qualitative analysis of consciousness into its various parts, while Wundt saw it as a means to quantitatively measure the whole of conscious experience. Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately, Titchener&#x27;s ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of structuralism.

===Historical misconceptions===
American historiography of introspection, according to some authors, is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular John B. Watson, was responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific psychology completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques. However, introspection may not have been the dominant method. It was widely believed to be dominant because Edward Titchener&#x27;s student Edwin G. Boring, in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology, privileged Titchener&#x27;s views while giving little credit to original sources. Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including Wilhelm Wundt and Knight Dunlap, who presented a non-behaviorist argument against self-observation. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but now implicitly, as self-report surveys, interviews and some fMRI studies are based on introspection. It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.

===Recent developments===

Partly as a result of Titchener&#x27;s misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism. Later psychological movements, such as functionalism and behaviorism, rejected introspection for its lack of scientific reliability among other factors. Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness and emphasizing the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism&#x27;s objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and subjectivity which conflicted with behaviorism&#x27;s focus on measurable behavior.

The more recently established cognitive psychology movement has to some extent accepted introspection&#x27;s usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the &quot;think aloud protocol&quot;, investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.

Already in the 18th century authors had criticized the use of introspection, both for knowing one&#x27;s own mind and as a method for psychology. David Hume pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, Christian Gottfried Schütz, noted that introspection is often described as mere &quot;inner sensation&quot;, but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively — one needs to know what to look for. Immanuel Kant added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind. Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between John Stuart Mill and Auguste Comte. Recent psychological research on cognition and attribution has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly confabulated. For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made. Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one&#x27;s own mind seem to be inferences from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person. However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection. The theory of the adaptive unconscious suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even &quot;high-level&quot; processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.
Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.

One of the central implications of dissociations between consciousness and meta-consciousness is that individuals, presumably including researchers, can misrepresent their experiences to themselves. Jack and Roepstorff assert, &#x27;...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.&#x27; Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to &#x27;lose touch with their feelings&#x27;. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.

Another question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.
That is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one&#x27;s actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.

Even when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being &quot;unaware of their unawareness&quot;. This phenomenon has been termed the &quot;introspection illusion&quot; and has been used to explain some cognitive biases and belief in some paranormal phenomena. When making judgements about themselves, subjects treat their own introspections as reliable, whereas they judge other people based on their behavior. This can lead to illusions of superiority. For example, people generally see themselves as less conformist than others, and this seems to be because they do not introspect any urge to conform. Another reliable finding is that people generally see themselves as less biased than everyone else, because they are not likely to introspect any biased thought processes.

One experiment tried to give their subjects access to others&#x27; introspections. They made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they answered a question about their own bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.

==In religion==

===Buddhism===
In Buddhism, &quot;Sampajañña&quot; refers to &quot;the mental process by which one continuously monitors one&#x27;s own body and mind. In the practice of &quot;śamatha&quot;, its principal function is to note the occurrence of laxity and excitation.&quot; It is of central importance for meditative practice in all Buddhist traditions.

===Judaism===
In Judaism, particularly in the teachings of the practitioners of Mussar a person could achieve progress in perfecting their character traits through a daily &quot;Cheshbon Hanefesh,&quot; or Accounting of the Soul. In the practice of Cheshbon Hanefesh, a person introspects about themselves, their day, their faults, progress, and so on, and over time can use the data and process to change behavior and thoughts. Introspection is encouraged during the penitent season in the month of Elul in order to correct the year&#x27;s sins through repentance, which in Judaism begins with recalling and recognizing them.

===Christianity===
In Christianity, perfection is not just the possession and preservation of sanctifying grace, since perfection is determined by one&#x27;s action, although Christian mysticism has gained a renewed interest in western Christianity and is prominent in eastern Christianity.

In Eastern Christianity some concepts addressing human needs, such as sober introspection &quot;(nepsis&quot;), require watchfulness of the human heart and the conflicts of the human &quot;nous&quot;, heart or mind. understanding can not be achieved by rational or discursive thought (i.e. systemization).

Rationalists view prayer as a way to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation (meditation).

===Jainism===
Jains practise &quot;pratikraman&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;introspection&quot;), a process of repentance of wrongdoings during their daily life, and remind themselves to refrain from doing so again. Devout Jains often do Pratikraman at least twice a day. Many practice Pratikraman on holy days such as Samvatsari, or Forgiveness Day.

=== Hinduism ===
Introspection is encouraged in schools such as Advaita Vedanta; in order for one to know their own true nature, they need to reflect and introspect on their true nature—which is what meditation is. Especially, Swami Chinmayananda emphasised the role of introspection in five stages, outlined in his book &quot;Self Unfoldment.&quot;

=== Islam ===
In Islam, &quot;greater jihad&quot; is the exertion of effort to internally struggle against one&#x27;s evil inclinations. In Sufism, ‘’nafs’’ is in its unrefined state &quot;the ego&quot;, which is considered to be the lowest dimension of a person&#x27;s inward existence—his animal and satanic nature.

==In fiction==
Introspection (also referred to as Rufus dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character&#x27;s thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, &quot;One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts…&quot;

According to Nancy Kress, a character&#x27;s thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story. As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both scene and sequel.

<text>The Torres Strait (), also known as Zenadh Kes ( [ˈzen̪ad̪ kes]), is a strait between Australia and the Melanesian island of New Guinea. It is wide at its narrowest extent. To the south is Cape York Peninsula, the northernmost extremity of the Australian mainland. To the north is the Western Province of Papua New Guinea. It is named after the Spanish navigator Luís Vaz de Torres, who sailed through the strait in 1606.

== History ==
=== Pre-colonisation ===
The islands of the Torres Strait have been inhabited by humans for at least 2,500 years and possibly much longer. The various Torres Strait Islander communities have a unique culture and long-standing history with the islands and nearby coastlines. Their maritime-based trade and interactions with the Papuans to the north and the Australian Aboriginal communities have maintained a steady cultural diffusion among the three societal groups, dating back thousands of years.

=== Era of European colonisation===
The first recorded European navigation of the strait was by Luís Vaz de Torres, a pilot who was second-in-command on the Spanish expedition led by navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós who sailed from Peru to the South Pacific in 1605. After Queirós&#x27;s ship returned to Mexico, Torres resumed the intended voyage to Manila via the Maluku Islands. He sailed along the south coast of New Guinea and discovered the strait that still bears his name. This discovery recorded in Spanish maps of the Pacific would later make possible James Cook&#x27;s expedition to Australia. Torres and his crew are not known to have sighted the Australian mainland visited just four months earlier by Willem Janszoon sailing without conversely becoming aware of the strait now known as Torres Strait. No specific records exists of Torres sighting the coast of a major land mass to his south, and early Spanish maps show the coast of New Guinea correctly but omit Australia.

In 1769 the Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whilst translating some Spanish documents captured in the Philippines in 1762, had found Luís Vaz de Torres&#x27;s testimony proving a passage south of New Guinea now known as Torres Strait. This discovery led Dalrymple to publish the &quot;Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean&quot; in 1770–1771, which aroused widespread interest in his claim of the existence of an unknown continent. It was Dalrymple who named the strait after Torres. Dalrymple was bitterly disappointed that it was James Cook and not he who was appointed commander of the expedition that eventually led in 1770 to the British encounter and charting of the eastern coastline of Australia.

In 1770 Lieutenant James Cook rounded Cape York, turned south-west and landed on Possession Island. From the top of a hill, he signalled down to the ship that he could see a navigable passage through the dangerous Strait. Later in Batavia, where he learnt that the French had preceded him across the Pacific, Cook re-wrote this signalling drill as a possession ceremony, saying he had claimed Australia&#x27;s east coast for the British Crown.

In 1823 Captain John Lihou, Master of the 550-ton merchant ship &quot;&quot; of Calcutta, was on passage from Manila to South America and chose a route through Torres Strait. Remarkably, this would become the first time for a ship to be navigated through the Torres Strait from west to east. According to the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; of April 1823: &quot;This essay of nautical skill was accomplished after the loss of four anchors and the rudder&quot;. It was also the first occasion a ship was navigated through the Coral Sea from Torres Strait, south-eastward to the southward of New Caledonia. Lihou saw Sir James Saumarez&#x27; Shoal (now Saumarez Reefs) on 27 February and named the reef system after Vice-Admiral James Saumarez. On this same trip, Lihou discovered the Lihou Reef and Cays and Port Lihou (originally named Port Yarborough, on the southern shore of Prince of Wales Island).

The London Missionary Society arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) in 1871. Although some of the Torres Strait islands lie just off the coast of New Guinea, they were annexed in 1879 by colony of Queensland, then a British colony. There was an important pearling industry from the 1860s until about 1970 when it collapsed in the face of competition from the plastics industry. Pearl-shelling was responsible for the arrival of experienced divers from many countries, notably Japan.

In 1978 an agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea determined the maritime border in the Torres Strait.

In the 1980s, Torres Strait Island people wanted to create a name for the islands which related to their culture. Initially the name &quot;Magani Malu Kes&quot; was suggested for the region, but later adopting the acronym &quot;Zenadh Kes&quot;, to refer to the Torres Strait. The acronym &quot;ZENADTH KES&quot; was first derived from &#x27;Zey&#x27; (south), &#x27;Naygay&#x27; (north), &#x27;Dagam&#x27; (place/side), &#x27;Thawathaw&#x27; (coastline) and KES (passage/channel/waterway). However, this has become modified and it is now spelt Zenadh Kes. 

Due to proximity to the Papua New Guinea mainland, the northern Torres Strait islands experience occasional asylum seeker arrivals from across the Strait. A total of ten asylum seekers from Papua New Guinea were detected in each of 2012 and 2013.

== Geography ==
The strait links the Coral Sea to the east with the Arafura Sea and Gulf of Carpentaria in the west. Although it is an important international sea lane, it is very shallow (water depth of ), and the maze of reefs and islands can make it hazardous to navigate. In the south the Endeavour Strait is located between Prince of Wales Island (Muralug) and the mainland. Shipping enters Torres Strait via the Adolphus Channel, which joins to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon to the southeast. Strong tidal currents occur in the narrow channels between islands and reefs, and large submarine sand dunes migrate across the seafloor. Some 580 coral reefs, including the Warrior Reefs and Eastern Patch Reefs, cover a total area of in the region, and the area also has some of the most extensive seagrass beds in the world.
Several clusters of islands lie in the Strait, collectively called the Torres Strait Islands. There are at least 274 of these islands, of which 17 have present-day permanent settlements. These islands have a variety of topographies, ecosystems and formation history. Several of those closest to the New Guinea coastline are low-lying, formed by alluvial sedimentary deposits borne by the outflow of the local rivers into the sea. Many of the western islands are hilly and steep, formed mainly of granite, and are peaks of the northernmost extension of the Great Dividing Range. They became islands as sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age. The central islands are predominantly coral cays, and those of the east are of volcanic origins.

There are several major policy and institutional frameworks in the Torres Strait region that support the sustainable use and management of marine resources while also protecting habitats, biodiversity and the traditional islander way of life. Most important of these is the Torres Strait Treaty, entered into by Australia and Papua New Guinea in February 1985. The Treaty defines sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries. It guides decision makers on protecting the way of life and livelihood of traditional inhabitants, on managing the protection of habitats, and on sharing the commercial and traditional fisheries resources. The Treaty established a Torres Strait Protected Zone within which both nations manage access to fisheries resources. Each country exercises sovereign jurisdiction for resources on either side of the agreed jurisdiction lines.

Environmental issues facing the region include the risk of mining waste from the Fly River in southern Papua New Guinea and the sustainable management of natural resources.

==People, culture and languages==

The islands&#x27; indigenous inhabitants are the Torres Strait Islanders, one of two ethnically distinct groups of Indigenous Australian peoples. Torres Strait Islanders are distinct from both the Papuans of adjoining New Guinea and from Aboriginal Australian peoples of the nearby Australian mainland, but related to both.

The people of the Torres Strait have a unique indigenous culture which has drawn the interest of a range of anthropological, historical, archaeological and folklorist researchers. This includes an expedition from Cambridge University led by the early ethnographer Alfred Haddon in 1898, and the more contemporary regional work of Australian anthropologist Jeremy Beckett. Accounts of local Indigenous narrative traditions can be found in the work of Nonie Sharp and Margaret Lawrie. Lawrie developed strong relationships with the people of the Torres Strait from the 1950s to 1970s, and many approached her to record and write down their personal stories and family histories. This resulted in her conducting research into the cultural history of the Torres Strait and collecting transcripts, audio recordings, photographs, slides, works of art and oral stories. Collectively they formed the basis of the publication &quot;Myths and Legends of Torres Strait&quot; (1970) and &quot;Tales from Torres Strait&quot; (1972). Her collection is now held by the State Library of Queensland and in 2008 it was added to UNESCO&#x27;s Australian Memory of the World Register.

Two indigenous languages are spoken on the Torres Strait Islands: Kala Lagaw Ya (also known by variant names and spellings), and Meriam Mir (Meriam), as well as Brokan [Broken], otherwise called Torres Strait Creole. Kala Lagaw Ya is the traditional language owned by the Western and Central islands of the Torres Strait. The Kala Lagaw Ya language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Torres Shire Council. Mabuiag is considered a dialect of Kala Lagaw Ya, one of the languages of the Torres Strait. Mabuiag (also written as Mabuyag) is a traditional language of Mabuiag, a Central Western island of the Torres Strait. The Mabuiag language region includes the island landscape of Mabuiag within the local government boundaries of the Torres Shire Council and Mabuiag Island Council.

In the 2016 Australian census, the population of the islands was recorded as 4,514 on the Islands, but many more Torres Strait Islander people live outside of Torres Strait in Australia.

== Shipping routes ==

The two routes through the Strait are:
*Endeavour Strait (purple line on chart) – for small vessels.
*Prince of Wales Channel: Larger ships transiting Torres Strait enter the Prince of Wales Channel from the West just north of Booby Island by way of the Gannet or Varzin Passages. The minimum depths for deep draught shipping in the Great Barrier Reef pilotage area are found here (Nov 2011). Shipping with a static draught or less are permitted to transit the area.
**Channels to the East of Prince of Wales Channel
***Great North East Channel: East of Prince of Wales Channel at Wednesday Island the Route becomes The Great North East Channel (green line on chart). The Great North East Channel (GNEC) links the Prince of Wales Channel to the northernmost entrance to the Great Barrier Reef, 120 NM away at Bligh Entrance. The GNEC route runs North or South of Alert Patches and East to under Twin Island then Northeast to Dalrymple Island (the end of Pilotage requirement) then on to Bramble Quay, Bligh Entrance and the open sea. This passage routes shipping to the Coral Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the outside of the Great Barrier Reef. Another channel (brown line on chart) runs down towards Cape York.
***Inner Route Pilotage Area: The Inner Route Pilotage Area runs from near Cape York to near Cairns. This channel, named the &#x27;Inner Route&#x27; runs between the Australian mainland and the Great Barrier Reef

==In literature==
Torres Strait is mentioned in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; as a dangerous strait where the submarine, the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, is briefly stranded.

<text>A well-bird exam is a check-up for birds which are assumed to be healthy. These examinations are frequently performed by an avian veterinarian when the bird is first acquired and annually thereafter.

==The examination==
The veterinarian will likely ask the owner about the bird&#x27;s housing, diet, and activities, then examine the birds feathers, eyes, ears, and nares for signs of illness. He or she will probably acquire a Gram&#x27;s stain, and may also clip the bird&#x27;s wings and toenails if requested. He or she will likely offer advice about caring for the pet.

==Importance==
Birds often hide their illnesses very well, and an avian veterinarian may see symptoms of illness that are not observable to the untrained eye. Periodic examination serves as a baseline for comparison for future reference. If an examined bird ever becomes sick and requires the care of a veterinarian, he or she will already have much data about the bird&#x27;s weight (one of the earliest indicators of illness in birds), diet, and care.

<doc id="317508" wikidata="Q1441519" url="?curid=317508" title="Volition (psychology)">
<text>Volition, also known as will or conation, is the cognitive process by which an individual decides on and commits to a particular course of action. It is defined as purposive striving and is one of the primary human psychological functions. Others include affect (feeling or emotion), motivation (goals and expectations), and cognition (thinking). Volitional processes can be applied consciously or they can be automatized as habits over time.

Most modern conceptions of volition address it as a process of conscious action control which becomes automatized (e.g. see Heckhausen and Kuhl; Gollwitzer; Boekaerts and Corno).

==Overview==
Many researchers treat &quot;volition&quot; and &quot;willpower&quot; as scientific and colloquial terms (respectively) for the same process. When a person &quot;makes up their mind&quot; to do a thing, that state is termed &#x27;immanent volition&#x27;. When we put forth any particular act of choice, that act is called an emanant, executive, or imperative volition. When an immanent or settled state of choice controls or governs a series of actions, that state is termed predominant volition. Subordinate volitions are particular acts of choice which carry into effect the object sought for by the governing or &quot;predominant volition&quot;.

According to Gary Kielhofner&#x27;s &quot;Model of Human Occupation&quot;, volition is one of the three sub-systems that act on human behavior. Within this model, volition refers to a person&#x27;s values, interests and self-efficacy (personal causation) about personal performance. Kurt Lewin argues that motivation and volition are one and the same, in distinction to the nineteenth century psychologist Narziß Ach. Ach proposed that there is a certain threshold of desire that distinguishes motivation from volition: when desire lies below this threshold, it is motivation, and when it crosses over, it becomes volition. In the book &quot;A Bias for Action&quot;, Heinrich Bruch and Sumantra Ghoshal also differentiate volition (willpower) from motivation. Using this model, they propose assessing individuals&#x27; differing levels of commitment with regard to tasks by measuring it on a scale of intent from motivation(an emotion) to volition (a decision). Discussions of impulse control (e.g., Kuhl and Heckhausen) and education (e.g., Corno), also make the motivation-volition distinction. Corno&#x27;s model ties volition to the processes of self-regulated learning.

<text>An avian veterinarian is a veterinarian who specializes in treating birds. All veterinarians, upon first qualification from a certified veterinary college, may treat any species. Additional training is required for qualification to become a recognized specialist in the care of birds.

In the United States, a veterinarian can specialize in avian medicine and surgery via post-graduate training through the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners and become a Diplomate of the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (Avian Practice). Avian veterinarians can become members of the Association of Avian Veterinarians for additional education opportunities including a journal and an annual conference.

In Europe, veterinarians become recognized as avian specialists by qualifying as a Diplomate of the European College of Zoological Medicine (Avian), and in Australia and New Zealand by qualifying as a Member or Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Veterinary Scientists.

<doc id="317512" wikidata="Q471751" url="?curid=317512" title="Tommy Lapid">
<text>Joseph &quot;Tommy&quot; Lapid (; born Tomislav Lampel []; 27 December 1931 – 1 June 2008) was a Yugoslav-born Israeli radio and television presenter, playwright, journalist, politician and government minister known for his sharp tongue and acerbic wit. Lapid headed the secular-liberal Shinui party from 1999 to 2006. He fiercely opposed the ultra-Orthodox political parties and actively sought to exclude any religious observance from the legal structure of the Israeli State. He was the father of Yair Lapid, who served as the 14th Prime Minister of Israel in 2022.

== Biography ==
Lapid was born in Novi Sad, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (modern-day Serbia), to a family of Hungarian Jewish descent. His family was seized by the Nazis and deported to the Budapest Ghetto. His father, Dr. Bela (Meir) Lampel, a lawyer and Zionist leader, was deported to Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was murdered. His grandmother Hermione was murdered in Auschwitz. Lapid and his mother were rescued by Raoul Wallenberg in Budapest. They survived the war and moved to Israel in 1948 where he worked at the Hungarian-language Israeli paper &quot;Új Kelet&quot; with Rudolf Kasztner. After serving as a radio operator in the Israel Defense Forces between 1950 and 1953, Lapid graduated with a law degree from Tel Aviv University in 1957. He married Shulamit Lapid, an acclaimed novelist; they had three children. Their son, Yair Lapid, is the chairman of the political party Yesh Atid, which became the second-biggest party in the 2013 Israeli elections, and was a columnist and television host. Yair became Prime Minister of Israel on 1 July 2022. Tommy and Shulamit&#x27;s youngest daughter, Merav, is a clinical psychologist. Their elder daughter, Michal, was killed in a car accident in 1984.

== Media career ==
Lapid started out as a journalist for the Israeli Hungarian-language newspaper &quot;Új Kelet&quot;. Later, he was hired by the mainstream daily &quot;Maariv,&quot; where he became an influential publicist, and went on to become director-general of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and chairman of the Cable TV Union. He was also the founding editor of Israeli women&#x27;s magazine &quot;At&quot;, as well as a successful playwright.

In the 1990s Lapid was a regular guest on the political talk show &quot;Popolitika&quot; aired on Channel 1 which often turned into a shouting match; later on he moved to the Channel 2 talk show, &quot;Politika&quot;.

In October 1994, on a Canada AM TV show interview with ex-Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky, journalist Valerie Pringle spoke by phone with Lapid regarding recent inflammatory comments he had made on Popolitika regarding Ostrovsky and his latest book, &quot;The Other Side of Deception.&quot; Lapid reiterated his earlier comments that he felt Ostrovsky was a traitor to Israel and hoped that &quot;there will be a decent Jew in Canada who can assassinate him for us.&quot;　

Lapid was awarded the Sokolov Award, Israel&#x27;s top award in journalism, in 1998, for his weekly radio show.

== Political career ==
In the late 1990s, Lapid joined Avraham Poraz&#x27;s Shinui party, which boosted the party&#x27;s standing in the Israeli political scene. Lapid became party chairman and Shinui won six seats in the 1999 elections, with Lapid entering the Knesset for the first time. In the 2003 elections the party ran on a secularist platform and won 15 seats, making it the third-largest in the Knesset after Likud and Labour. Shinui was invited to join the government of Ariel Sharon and Lapid was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice.

It was suggested that Israel&#x27;s pro-Serbian position in 1999, was a result of the Serbian population&#x27;s history of saving Jews during the Holocaust, personal memories of which were still present among older Israeli politicians, such as Lapid, serving in government at the time.

Between 2001 and 2006, Lapid, via a bill passed by the Knesset, established the commission of &quot;Future Generations&quot;, headed by retired judge Shlomo Shoham, an office that was later closed down by a bill passed by then Knesset member and Chairman of the Knesset Committee, Yariv Levin, on the grounds that the commission was a &quot;big malfunction&quot; in which &quot;a commissioner sits above us while we&#x27;re the elected officials. Apparently, this commissioner was granted the &#x27;prophecy&#x27; that he knows what is best for future generations.&quot; In a rebuttal, Shoham stated that &quot;the Chairman of the Knesset Committee does not understand the essence of the position of &quot;Commissioner of Future Generations&quot; within the checks and balances of democracy.&quot;

The tension between Shinui and Likud grew when the ultra-Orthodox party Agudat Yisrael was brought into the coalition. Shinui could not implement many of its electoral promises, such as instituting civil marriage, and a dispute erupted over state aid to religious institutions. As a result, Shinui quit the coalition in December 2004. Lapid announced the formation of a Shadow Cabinet based on the British model on 3 January 2005, before being appointed Leader of the Opposition a week later. In late March 2005, Lapid voted in favor of the budget in exchange for minor concessions in order to keep the government from falling, which was liable to lead to early elections and impede the implementation of the disengagement plan.

In Shinui&#x27;s primary elections held shortly before the 2006 elections, Lapid retained the party leadership. However, his deputy Poraz lost second place on the list. In the ensuing crisis, Poraz and several other Shinui MKs left the party and founded Hetz. Lapid left Shinui two weeks after the vote and announced his support for Poraz&#x27;s new party, but chose not to be involved in the new party&#x27;s leadership, instead of serving as a figurehead. In the elections, he was allocated the symbolic 120th place on the Hetz list, but the party failed to win a seat. 

== Non-political activities ==
In July 2006, Lapid was appointed Advisory Board Chairman of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority, a role he called &quot;a sacred duty&quot;.

He appeared on &quot;Council of Wise Men&quot;, an Israeli television program on Israel 10 channel. He hosted his own radio program on Reshet Bet. He also was a chairman of the Israel Chess Society and served as an honorary member of the Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.
== Death ==
Lapid was hospitalized at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv in serious condition on 30 May 2008. He died on 1 June 2008, aged 76, after a battle with cancer.

== Other ==
In March 2011, street Nova 30 in Veternik, a suburb of Novi Sad, was renamed to &quot;ulica Tomija Josefa Lapida&quot; (Serbian for &quot;Tommy Joseph Lapid Street&quot;).

<text>Erik Nevland (born 10 November 1977) is a Norwegian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is currently the sporting director of Viking. He played for clubs in Norway, England, Sweden and the Netherlands, and earned eight caps for the Norway national football team from his debut in 2001. After retiring, Nevland worked as a car salesman.

==Club career==
Nevland was born in Stavanger, Rogaland. He started his career at Viking, but in 1997 he was sold to Manchester United at the age of 19, before he had played a single first team match for the Norway side. What prompted Manchester United to sign him was a succession of hat-tricks in three games when he was on trial with them. His only goal for the United first team was in a League Cup match against Bury in October 1998. He never managed to establish himself in the United team, with a successful loan spell at Viking and an unsuccessful one at IFK Göteborg. He only ever made one league appearance for United, as a substitute against Southampton on 19 January 1998.

He returned to Viking on a permanent contract in January 2000, winning the Norwegian Cup in 2001 and scoring the two deciding goals in their famous UEFA Cup victory over Chelsea in 2002. He joined Groningen on a free transfer in November 2004, and went on to become a cult hero. In his first half-season for his new club, he scored 16 times in 20 matches. Nevland scored the first ever goal in Groningen&#x27;s new Euroborg stadium.

On 27 April 2007, Nevland signed a new three-year contract with Groningen. In December 2007, Nevland was voted &#x27;Groninger of the Year&#x27; by television viewers in Groningen, although having been born outside the Netherlands.

On 28 January 2008, he signed with Premier League side Fulham for a fee of €2.5 million (£1.85 million), plus a further €0.5 million (£370k) if Fulham retained Premier League status, which they did. On 3 February, he made only his second ever Premier League appearance when Fulham played Aston Villa at Craven Cottage.

After making over 50 league appearances for Fulham, and despite Roy Hodgson&#x27;s wish to keep him at the club, Nevland once again returned to Viking in June 2010. He was assigned the role as captain.

==International career==
He has eight international caps for the Norway national football team; his first cap was in 2001.

He also has 22 caps and one international goal to his name with the U-21 side. He participated in the 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship where Norway achieved a third-place finish.

==Later career==
On 5 August 2021, Nevland was appointed sporting director of Viking.

<doc id="317517" wikidata="Q8025126" url="?curid=317517" title="Wing clipping">
<text>Wing clipping is the process of trimming a bird&#x27;s primary wing feathers or &quot;remiges&quot; so that it is not fully flight-capable, until it moults, sheds the cut feathers, and grows new ones.

This procedure is usually carried out by avian veterinarians, breeders, or the bird&#x27;s owners, and primarily on pet birds like parrots. Different techniques involve varying number of feathers cut and the amount of feather length left behind. These methods can have potential physical and psychological effects on birds, such as injury from falls, distress, and behavioral changes.

Molting in birds with clipped wings can expose their growing blood feathers, making them vulnerable to damage and excessive bleeding. Moreover, wing-clipping can disrupt the birds&#x27; natural flight and landing behavior, potentially leading to crashes at higher speeds than unclipped birds.

Despite this, it is suggested that young birds be allowed to learn to fly properly before any wing clipping occurs. This will enable them to remain more confident and active and learn crucial landing skills.

The practice of wing clipping is controversial, with some avian veterinarians endorsing it while others oppose it. While clipping can prevent indoor accidents like hitting ceiling fans or windows, it also restricts the bird&#x27;s mobility, exercise, and ability to escape fearful situations. Some argue it&#x27;s a necessary safety practice, particularly for climbing birds, while others feel it&#x27;s cruel and unnecessary if birds can be trained to respond to flight commands. The practice appears more common in American bird care literature than in British sources.

==Technique==

Wing clipping is usually performed by avian veterinarians, pet store employees, breeders, or the birds&#x27; owners themselves. It is generally carried out on pet birds, particularly parrots. If performed correctly, it is a painless procedure and is quite distinct from pinioning, which is carried out by amputation of the wing at the carpal joint. It is, however, not harmless as it can lead to indirect injury from falls, and is known to cause psychological distress.

Techniques for clipping the wings vary primarily in the number of feathers cut and the amount of each feather left behind. A mild clip on one wing only can impair a bird&#x27;s flight greatly, as it renders the bird unbalanced in the air. This can cause injury or death to the bird if it strikes a hard surface during a fall. In most cases, only the primary flight feathers are cut, and an equal number of feathers are trimmed on each wing to avoid causing the bird to become unbalanced in flight. The most common clip involves trimming the primary flight feathers below the level of the primary coverts (usually removing about half to a third of the length of the flight feather). This clip is quick and simple to do, but leaves exposed cut ends that occasionally may cause a bird to chew on the cut feathers. Another method of clipping involves cutting the flight feather above the level of the coverts, so almost the entire feather is removed. This clip does not leave any exposed cut ends, but as more of each feather is removed, fewer feathers should be cut. However, these cut feather stumps are still present and may irritate the bird, causing significant discomfort. 

Where parrots have clipped primary feathers, the moulting sequence of these birds renders them vulnerable to damage of their growing blood feathers. Most parrots have 10 primary feathers, numbered 1 (innermost) to 10 (outermost). The moult starts by the bird shedding and replacing a &quot;central&quot; primary feather, usually number 6. The sequence continues in both directions along the primaries, so the last primary feathers to be replaced are the innermost and the outermost ones numbered 1 and 10, respectively. Clipped birds, therefore, have their first blood feathers growing down without the normal protection of full-length feathers lying next to them. These unprotected blood feathers are vulnerable to being broken and profuse bleeding can occur. Regardless of their size, most parrots replace their feathers by a daily growth rate of 3 to 4 mm. Thus, large species such as macaws may take over a year to complete a moult, but smaller species such as cockatiels will moult within a few weeks. So, larger birds, and those with a higher wing-loading, remain vulnerable to blood feather damage for a longer period, since they are moulting almost continually. 
A &#x27;light&#x27; symmetrical wing-clip allows a bird to fly down and land safely while indoors. However, such a clip may not prevent the bird from flying when outdoors, since lift is generated in proportion to wind speed. Many escaped birds that are recovered are found to have been clipped. So, while a light clip allows downward flight indoors, it does not prevent a bird gaining lift if it should escape outdoors. Conversely, a more severe clip certainly renders a bird flightless, but it increases the risk of injury if the bird falls and hits a hard surface. In addition to the physical effects of wing-clipping, adverse behavioural effects can occur. Birds use flight as an instinctive reflex action and as their first means of escaping any threat; they take to the air to fly upwards and away from the source of the threat; their fear then dissipates. Where this behaviour is prevented by wing-clipping, this innate reflex action is denied the bird, and its fear does not subside. This may cause behavioural problems for the afflicted bird. When a bird needs to reduce its speed during flight, it employs a &#x27;reverse thrust&#x27; action by extending its wings vertically and using the drag of its primaries as air brakes. While the reduced function of the clipped bird&#x27;s primaries prevent propulsion and therefore lift, this also reduces braking abilities, so clipped birds may crash-land at higher speeds than full-winged birds. Clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, as even clipped birds have been known to fly away when spooked outdoors.

It is generally considered very important for a young bird to be allowed to fledge (learn to fly) properly, prior to any wing clipping. Breeders and owners usually find that a fledged bird, even after being clipped, will remain more confident and active than an unfledged bird. Learning to fly also helps a bird learn how to land safely, an important skill even in clipped birds.

==Controversy==
While clipping is endorsed by some avian veterinarians, others oppose it.

By restricting flight, wing clipping may help prevent indoor birds from risking injury from ceiling fans or flying into large windows, but no evidence shows that clipped birds are safer than full-winged ones, only that clipped birds are subject to different kinds of accidents from full-winged birds. Social pet birds (such as parrots) may also be clipped both to restrict independence and in attempts to make them tamer and easier to manage to encourage them to socialize with their owners; some parrots that show aggression to certain people or other birds may be clipped to prevent attack. Others advocate for birds to be trained to respond to flight commands, mitigating the need for wing clipping
Some people feel wing clipping is a cruel or unhealthy practice, as it denies a bird its most natural way of getting around, obtaining exercise, and avoiding fearful situations. Although clipped birds can and should be encouraged to do wing-flapping exercises, this does not provide the same exercise as flight. Others feel that for birds that can climb well, wing clipping is a necessary safety practice for birds in many situations. The practice seems more prevalent in American bird care books than in similar British publications.

<text>Rudolf Kempe (14 June 1910 – 12 May 1976) was a German conductor.

== Biography ==
Kempe was born in Dresden, where from the age of fourteen he studied at the Dresden State Opera School. He played oboe in the opera orchestra of Dortmund and then in the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra, from 1929. In addition to oboe, he played the piano regularly, as a soloist, in chamber music or accompanying, as a result of which, in 1933, the new Director of the Leipzig Opera invited Kempe to become a &quot;répétiteur&quot;, and later a conductor, for the opera.

During the Second World War Kempe was conscripted into the army, but instead of active service was directed into musical activities, playing for the troops and later taking over the chief conductorship of the Chemnitz opera house.

== Career ==

=== Opera ===
Kempe directed the Dresden Opera and the Staatskapelle Dresden from 1949 to 1952, making his first records, including &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; and &quot;Der Freischütz.&quot; &#x27;He obtains some superlative playing from the Dresden orchestra,&#x27; commented &quot;The Record Guide&quot;. He maintained a relationship with the Dresden orchestra for the rest of his life, making some of his best-known records with them during the stereo era.

His international career began with engagements at the Vienna State Opera in the 1951 season, for which he conducted &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, &quot;Simon Boccanegra,&quot; and &quot;Capriccio.&quot;

He was invited to succeed Georg Solti as chief conductor of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich from 1952 to 1954, and was permitted by the East German authorities to do so without severing his ties with Dresden. In 1953 Kempe appeared with the Munich company at the Royal Opera House in London, where the General Administrator, Sir David Webster, quickly decided that Kempe would be an ideal Music Director for Covent Garden. Kempe declined the appointment, and did not accept the top job at any opera house after leaving Munich in 1954. He nonetheless conducted frequently at Covent Garden and was immensely popular there, leading among other works, &quot;Salome,&quot; &quot;Elektra,&quot; &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, &quot;Un Ballo in Maschera&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, of which the critic Andrew Porter compared Kempe&#x27;s operatic conducting favourably with that of Arturo Toscanini and Victor de Sabata. As a guest conductor, Kempe frequently revisited Munich conducting mostly the Italian repertory.

Kempe&#x27;s début at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus was in 1960. The Ring cycle he conducted there in that year was notable for multiple casting, with the role of Wotan split between Hermann Uhde and Jerome Hines, and Brünnhilde between Astrid Varnay and Birgit Nilsson.

=== Orchestral ===
Kempe was associated with the Royal Philharmonic (RPO) from 1955. In 1960, he became its Associate Conductor, chosen by the orchestra&#x27;s founder, Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1961 and 1962 he was Principal Conductor of the RPO, and from 1963 to 1975 its Artistic Director. A member of the RPO later said of Kempe, &quot;He was a wonderful controller of the orchestra, and a very great accompanist ... Kempe was like someone driving a racing-car, following the piano round the bends.&quot; Kempe abolished Beecham&#x27;s male-only rule, introducing women into the RPO: an orchestra without them, he said, &quot;always reminds me of the army.&quot; The first was violinist Christa Ruppert. In 1970, the RPO named him Conductor for Life, but in 1975, he resigned his post with the orchestra.

From 1965 to 1972 Kempe worked with Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, and from 1967 to his death conducted the Munich Philharmonic, with whom he made international tours and recorded the first quadraphonic set of the Beethoven symphonies.

In the final months of his life, Kempe was the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The opening concert of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts on 16 July 1976, in which he was to have conducted his BBC forces in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, became a memorial concert for him following Kempe&#x27;s death in Zürich, two months earlier, aged 65.

<text>Andrew Henry Vachss ( ; October 19, 1942 – November 23, 2021) was an American crime fiction author, child protection consultant, and attorney exclusively representing children and youths.

== Early life and career ==
Vachss grew up in Manhattan on the Lower West Side. Before becoming a lawyer, Vachss held many front-line positions in child protection. He was a federal investigator in sexually transmitted diseases, and a New York City social-services caseworker. He worked in Biafra, entering the war zone just before the fall of the country. There he worked to find a land route to bring donated food and medical supplies across the border after the seaports were blocked and Red Cross airlifts banned by the Nigerian government; however, all attempts ultimately failed, resulting in rampant starvation.

After he returned and recovered from his injuries, including malaria and malnutrition, Vachss studied community organizing in 1970 under Saul Alinsky. He worked as a labor organizer and ran a self-help center for urban migrants in Chicago. He then managed a re-entry program for ex-convicts in Massachusetts, and finally directed a maximum-security prison for violent juvenile offenders.

As an attorney, Vachss represented only children and adolescents. In addition to his private practice, he served as a law guardian in New York state. In every child abuse or neglect case, state law requires the appointment of a law guardian, a lawyer who represents the child&#x27;s interests during the legal proceedings.

== Writings ==
Andrew Vachss was the author of 33 novels and three collections of short stories, as well as poetry, plays, song lyrics, and graphic novels.
As a novelist, he was perhaps best known for his Burke series of hardboiled mysteries; &quot;Another Life&quot; constituted the finale to the series.

After completing the Burke novels, Vachss began two new series. Vachss released the first novel in the Dell &amp; Dolly trilogy, entitled &quot;Aftershock&quot;, in 2013. The second novel, &quot;Shockwave&quot;, was released in 2014, and &quot;Signwave&quot;, the final book, was published in June 2015. Departing from Vachss&#x27; familiar urban settings, the trilogy focuses on Dell, a former soldier and assassin, and Dolly, a former nurse with Doctors Without Borders and the love of Dell&#x27;s life. While living in the Pacific Northwest, Dell and Dolly use their war-honed skills to maintain a &quot;heads on stakes&quot; barrier against the predators who use their everyday positions in the community as camouflage to attack the vulnerable.

The Cross series uses distinctive supernatural aspects to further explore Vachss&#x27; argument that society&#x27;s failure to protect its children is the greatest threat to the human species. In 2012, Vachss&#x27; published &quot;Blackjack: A Cross Novel&quot;, featuring the mercenary Cross Crew, introduced in earlier Vachss short stories as Chicago&#x27;s most-feared criminal gang. &quot;Urban Renewal&quot;, the second novel in the Cross series, came out in 2014. The third in the series, &quot;Drawing Dead&quot;, was released in 2016.

In addition to the &quot;Aftershock&quot;, &quot;Burke&quot;, and &quot;Cross&quot; series, Vachss wrote several stand-alone works. The first novel he published outside the Burke series was &quot;Shella.&quot; Released in 1993, &quot;Shella&quot; was the most polarizing of his works in terms of critical response. Vachss often referred to &quot;Shella&quot; as his &quot;beloved orphan&quot; until the 2004 release of &quot;The Getaway Man&quot;, a tribute to the Gold Medal paperback originals of the 1960s. In 2005, Vachss released the epic &quot;Two Trains Running&quot;, a novel which takes place entirely during a two-week span in 1959, a critical period in American history. In form, &quot;Two Trains Running&quot; presents as a work composed entirely of transcribed surveillance tapes, akin to a collage film constructed only of footage from a single source. His 2009 novel, &quot;Haiku&quot;, focuses on the troubled lives of a band of homeless men in New York City, struggling to connect with and protect each other. In 2010, Vachss published two books: his novel &quot;The Weight&quot;, is a noir romance involving a professional thief and a young widow in hiding. &quot;Heart Transplant&quot;, an illustrated novel in an experimental design, tells the story of an abused and bullied young boy who finds his inner strength with the help of an unexpected mentor. &quot;That&#x27;s How I Roll&quot;, released in 2012, chronicles the death-row narrative of a hired killer as he reveals the secrets of his past, both horrifying and tender.

Vachss collaborated on works with authors Jim Colbert (&quot;Cross&quot;, 1995) and Joe R. Lansdale (&quot;Veil&#x27;s Visit&quot;, 1999). He also created illustrated works with artists Frank Caruso (&quot;Heart Transplant&quot;, 2010) and Geof Darrow (&quot;Another Chance to Get It Right&quot;, 1993; &quot;The Shaolin Cowboy Adventure Magazine&quot;, 2014). Vachss&#x27; graphic novel, &quot;Underground&quot;, was released in November 2014.

Vachss also wrote non-fiction, including numerous articles and essays on child protection and a book on juvenile criminology. His books have been translated into 20 languages, and his shorter works have appeared in many publications, including &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Antaeus&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Vachss&#x27; literary awards include the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière for &quot;Strega&quot; [as &quot;La Sorcière de Brooklyn&quot;]; the Falcon Award, Maltese Falcon Society of Japan, for &quot;Strega&quot;; the Deutscher Krimi Preis for &quot;Flood&quot; [as &quot;Kata&quot;]; and the Raymond Chandler Award for his body of work.

Andrew Vachss was a member of PEN and the Writers Guild of America. His autobiographical essay was added by invitation to &quot;Contemporary Authors&quot; in 2003.

=== Child protection ===
Many of Vachss&#x27; novels feature the shadowy, unlicensed investigator Burke, an ex-con, career criminal, and deeply conflicted character. About his protagonist, Vachss said:

Vachss coined the phrase &quot;Children of the Secret&quot;, which refers to abused children, of whatever age, who were victimized without ever experiencing justice, much less love and protection. In the Burke novels, some of these Children of the Secret have banded together as adults into what Vachss called a &quot;family of choice&quot;. Their connection is not biological, and they form very loyal bonds. Most are career criminals; none allows the law to come before the duty to family.

Vachss originated the term &quot;Circle of Trust.&quot; which has since entered general circulation. Vachss coined the term to combat the mistaken over-emphasis on &quot;stranger danger,&quot; a bias that prevents society from focusing on the most common way children are accessed for victimization:

Another term Vachss originated is &quot;Transcenders.&quot;

=== Dogs ===
Another important theme that pervades Vachss&#x27; work is his love of dogs, particularly breeds considered &quot;dangerous,&quot; such as Doberman pinschers, rottweilers, and especially pit bulls. Throughout his writings, Vachss asserted that with dogs, just as with humans, &quot;you get what you raise.&quot;

He was a passionate advocate against animal abuse such as dog-fighting, and against breed-specific legislative bans. With fellow crime writer James Colbert, Vachss trained dogs to serve as therapy dogs for abused children. The dogs have a calming effect on traumatized children. Vachss noted that using these particular breeds further increases the victims&#x27; feelings of security; their &quot;dangerous&quot; appearance, in combination with the extensive therapy training, makes them excellent protection against human threats. During her time as chief prosecutor, Alice Vachss regularly brought one such trained dog, Sheba, to work with abused children being interviewed at the Special Victims Bureau.

==Personal life==
When Vachss was 7 years old, an older boy swung a chain at his right eye. The resulting injuries damaged the eye muscles and resulted in his wearing an eyepatch. According to Vachss, removing it had the effect of a strobe light flashing in his face. Vachss also had a small blue heart tattooed on his right hand.

Vachss&#x27; wife, Alice, was a sex crimes prosecutor, and she later became Chief of the Special Victims Bureau in Queens, New York. She is the author of the nonfiction book &quot;Sex Crimes: Ten Years on the Front Lines Prosecuting Rapists and Confronting Their Collaborators&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book of the Year. She has continued her work as Special Prosecutor for Sex Crimes in rural Oregon.

He died of coronary artery disease on November 23, 2021, at the age of 79 at his residence in Pacific Northwest.

<doc id="317524" wikidata="Q4026292" url="?curid=317524" title="Action (philosophy)">
<text>In philosophy, an action is an event that an agent performs for a purpose, that is, guided by the person&#x27;s intention. The first question in the philosophy of action is to determine how actions differ from other forms of behavior, like involuntary reflexes. According to Ludwig Wittgenstein, it involves discovering &quot;What is left over if I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I raise my arm&quot;. There is broad agreement that the answer to this question has to do with the agent&#x27;s intentions. So driving a car is an action since the agent intends to do so, but sneezing is a mere behavior since it happens independent of the agent&#x27;s intention. The dominant theory of the relation between the intention and the behavior is &quot;causalism&quot;: driving the car is an action because it is &quot;caused&quot; by the agent&#x27;s intention to do so. On this view, actions are distinguished from other events by their causal history. Causalist theories include Donald Davidson&#x27;s account, which defines actions as bodily movements caused by intentions in the right way, and volitionalist theories, according to which volitions form a core aspect of actions. Non-causalist theories, on the other hand, often see intentions not as the action&#x27;s cause but as a constituent of it.

An important distinction among actions is between non-basic actions, which are done by doing something else, and basic actions, for which this is not the case. Most philosophical discussions of actions focus on physical actions in the form of bodily movements. But many philosophers consider mental actions to be a distinct type of action that has characteristics quite different from physical actions. Deliberations and decisions are processes that often precede and lead to actions. Actions can be rational or irrational depending on the reason for which they are performed. The problem of responsibility is closely related to the philosophy of actions since we usually hold people responsible for what they do.

== Conceptions ==
Conceptions of action try to determine what all actions have in common or what their essential features are. Causalist theories, like Donald Davidson&#x27;s account or standard forms of volitionalism, hold that causal relations between the agent&#x27;s mental states and the resulting behavior are essential to actions. According to Davidson, actions are bodily movements that are caused by intentions in the right way. Volitionalist theories include the notion of volitions in their account of actions. Volitions are understood as forms of summoning of means within one&#x27;s power and are different from merely intending to do something later. Non-causalists, on the other hand, deny that intentions or similar states cause actions.

=== Davidson&#x27;s account ===
The most well-known account of action, sometimes simply referred to as the &quot;standard account&quot;, is due to Davidson, who holds that actions are bodily movements that are caused by intentions. Davidson explains the intentions themselves in terms of beliefs and desires. For example, the action of flipping a light switch rests, on the one hand, on the agent&#x27;s belief that this bodily movement would turn on the light and, on the other hand, on the desire to have light. Because of its reliance on psychological states and causal relations, this position is considered to be a Humean theory of action. According to Davidson, it is not just the bodily behavior that counts as the action but also the consequences that follow from it. So the movement of the finger flipping the switch is part of the action as well as the electrons moving through the wire and the light bulb turning on. Some consequences are included in the action even though the agent did not intend them to happen. It is sufficient that what the agent does &quot;can be described under an aspect that makes it intentional&quot;. So, for example, if flipping the light switch alerts the burglar then alerting the burglar is part of the agent&#x27;s actions. In an example from Anscombe&#x27;s manuscript &quot;Intention&quot;, pumping water can also be an instance of poisoning the inhabitants.

One difficulty with theories of action that try to characterize actions in terms of causal relations between mental states and bodily movements, so-called &quot;causalist theories&quot;, is what has been referred to as &quot;wayward&quot; causal chains. A causal chain is &quot;wayward&quot; if the intention caused its goal to realize but in a very unusual way that was not intended, e.g. because the skills of the agent are not exercised in the way planned. For example, a rock climber forms the intention to kill the climber below him by letting go of the rope. A wayward causal chain would be that, instead of opening the holding hand intentionally, the intention makes the first climber so nervous that the rope slips through his hand and thus leads to the other climber&#x27;s death. Davidson addresses this issue by excluding cases of wayward causation from his account since they are not examples of intentional behavior in the strict sense. So bodily behavior only constitutes an action if it was caused by intentions &quot;in the right way&quot;.

One important objection to Davidson&#x27;s theory of actions is that it does not account for the agent&#x27;s role in the production of action. This role could include reflecting on what to do, choosing an alternative and then carrying it out. Another objection is that mere intentions seem to be insufficient to cause actions, that other additional elements, namely volitions or tryings, are necessary. For example, as John Searle has pointed out, there seems to be a causal gap between intending to do something and actually doing it, which needs an act of the will to be overcome.

=== Volitionalism ===
&quot;Volitionalists&quot; aim to overcome these shortcomings of Davidson&#x27;s account by including the notion of &quot;volition&quot; or &quot;trying&quot; in their theory of actions. &quot;Volitions&quot; and &quot;tryings&quot; are forms of affirming something, like &quot;intentions&quot;. They can be distinguished from intentions because they are directed at executing a course of action in the here and now, in contrast to intentions, which involve future-directed plans to do something later. Some authors also distinguish &quot;volitions&quot;, as acts of the will, from &quot;tryings&quot;, as the summoning of means within one&#x27;s power. But it has been argued that they can be treated as a unified notion since there is no important difference between the two for the theory of action because they play the same explanatory role. This role includes both the experiential level, involving the trying of something instead of merely intending to do so later, and the metaphysical level, in the form of mental causation bridging the gap between mental intention and bodily movement.

&quot;Volitionalism&quot; as a theory is characterized by three core theses: (1) that every bodily action is accompanied by a trying, (2) that tryings can occur without producing bodily movements and (3) that in the case of successful tryings, the trying is the cause of the bodily movement. The central idea of the notion of &quot;trying&quot; is found in the second thesis. It involves the claim that some of our tryings lead to successful actions while others arise without resulting in an action. But even in an unsuccessful case there is still something: it is different from not trying at all. For example, a paralyzed person, after having received a new treatment, may test if the treatment was successful by trying to move her legs. But trying and failing to move the legs is different from intending to do it later or merely wishing to do it: only in the former case does the patient learn that the treatment was unsuccessful. There is a sense in which tryings either take place or not, but cannot fail, unlike actions, whose success is uncertain. This line of thought has led some philosophers to suggest that the trying itself is an action: a special type of action called &quot;basic action&quot;. But this claim is problematic since it threatens to lead to a vicious regress: if something is an action because it was caused by a volition then we would have to posit one more volition in virtue of which the first trying can be regarded as an action.

An influential criticism of the volitional explanations of actions is due to Gilbert Ryle, who argued that volitions are either &quot;active&quot;, in which case the aforementioned regress is inevitable, or they are not, in which case there would be no need to posit them as an explanatory inert &quot;ghost in the machine&quot;. But it has been suggested that this constitutes a false dilemma: that volitions can play an explanatory role without leading to a &quot;vicious regress&quot;. John Stuart Mill, for example, avoids this problem by holding that actions are composed of two parts: a volition and the bodily movement corresponding to it.

Volitions can also be used to explain how the agent knows about her own action. This knowledge about what one is doing or trying to do is available directly through introspection: the agent does not need to observe her behavior through sensory perception to arrive at this knowledge, unlike an external observer. The experience of agency involved in volitions can be distinguished from the experience of freedom, which involves the additional aspect of having various alternative routes of action to choose from. But volition is possible even if there are no additional alternatives.

Volitionalists usually hold that there is a causal relation between volitions and bodily movements. Critics have pointed out that this position threatens to alienate us from our bodies since it introduces a strict distinction between our agency and our body, which is not how things appear to us. One way to avoid this objection is to hold that volitions constitute bodily movements, i.e. are an aspect of them, instead of causing them. Another response able to soften this objection is to hold that volitions are not just the initial triggers of the bodily movements but that they are continuous activities guiding the bodily movements while they are occurring.

=== Non-causalism ===
&quot;Non-causalist&quot; or &quot;anti-causalist&quot; theories deny that intentions or similar states cause actions. They thereby oppose &quot;causalist&quot; theories like Davidson&#x27;s account or standard forms of volitionalism. They usually agree that intentions are essential to actions. This brings with it the difficulty of accounting for the relation between intentions and actions in a non-causal way. Some suggestions have been made on this issue but this is still an open problem since none of them have gathered significant support. The teleological approach, for example, holds that this relation is to be understood not in terms of efficient causation but in terms of final &quot;causation&quot;. One problem with this approach is that the two forms of causation do not have to be incompatible. Few theorists deny that actions are teleological in the sense of being goal-oriented. But the representation of a goal in the agent&#x27;s mind may act as an efficient cause at the same time. Because of these problems, most of the arguments for non-causalism are negative: they constitute objections pointing out why causalist theories are unfeasible. Important among them are arguments from wayward causation: that behavior only constitutes an action if it was caused by an intention in the right way, not in any way. This critique focuses on difficulties causalists have faced in explicitly formulating how to distinguish between proper and wayward causation.

An important challenge to non-causalism is due to Davidson. As he points out, we usually have many different reasons for performing the same action. But when we perform it, we often perform it for one reason but not for another. For example, one reason for Abdul to go for cancer treatment is that he has prostate cancer, another is that they have his favorite newspaper in the waiting area. Abdul is aware of both of these reasons, but he performs this action only because of the former reason. Causalist theories can account for this fact through causal relation: the former but not the latter reason causes the action. The challenge to non-causalist theories is to provide a convincing non-causal explanation of this fact.

== Individuation ==
The problem of &quot;individuation&quot; concerns the question of whether two actions are identical or of how actions should be counted. For example, on April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth both pulled the trigger of his gun, fired a shot and killed Abraham Lincoln. On a &quot;fine-grained&quot; theory of &quot;individuation&quot;, the pulling, the firing and the killing are three distinct actions. In its most extreme form, there is one distinct action for every action type. So, for example, since &quot;singing&quot; and &quot;singing loudly&quot; are two different action types, someone who sings loudly performs at least these two distinct actions. This kind of view has the unintuitive consequence that even the most simple exercises of agency result in a vast number of actions. Theories of &quot;coarse-grained&quot; individuation of actions, on the other hand, hold that events that constitute each other or cause each other are to be counted as one action. On this view, the action of pulling the trigger is identical to the action of firing the gun and to the action of killing Lincoln. So in doing all of these things, Booth performed only one action. One intuition in favor of this view is that we often do one thing by doing another thing: we shoot the gun by pulling the trigger or we turn on the light by flipping the switch. One argument against this view is that the different events may happen at different times. For example, Lincoln died of his injuries the following day, so a significant time after the shooting. This raises the question of how to explain that two events happening at different times are identical.

== Types ==
=== Basic and non-basic ===
An important distinction among actions is between &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;non-basic actions&quot;. This distinction is closely related to the problem of individuation since it also depends on the notion of doing one thing &quot;by&quot; or &quot;in virtue of&quot; doing another thing, like turning on a light by flipping a switch. In this example, the flipping of the switch is more basic than the turning-on of the light. But the turning-on of the light can itself constitute another action, like the action of alerting the burglar. It is usually held that the chain or hierarchy of actions composed this way has a fundamental level at which it stops. The action at this fundamental level is called a &quot;basic action&quot;: it is not done by doing something else. For this reason, &quot;basic actions&quot; are simple while non-basic actions are complex.

It is often assumed that bodily movements are &quot;basic actions&quot;, like the pressing of one&#x27;s finger against the trigger, while the consequences of these movements, like the firing of the gun, are &quot;non-basic actions&quot;. But it seems that bodily movements are themselves constituted by other events (muscle contractions) which are themselves constituted by other events (chemical processes). However, it appears that these more basic events are not actions since they are not under our direct volitional control. One way to solve these complications is to hold that &quot;basic actions&quot; correspond to the most simple commands we can follow. This position excludes most forms of muscle contractions and chemical processes from the list of basic actions since we usually cannot follow the corresponding commands directly. What counts as a basic action, according to this view, depends on the agent&#x27;s skills. So contracting a given muscle is a basic action for an agent who has learned to do so. For something to be a basic action it is not just important what the agent can do but what the agent actually does. So raising one&#x27;s right hand may only count as a basic action if it is done directly through the right hand. If the agent uses her left hand to lift the right hand then the raising of the right hand is not a basic action anymore.

A contrasting view identifies basic actions not with bodily movements but with mental volitions. One motivation for this position is that volitions are the most direct element in the chain of agency: they cannot fail, unlike bodily actions, whose success is initially uncertain. One argument against this position is that it may lead to a vicious regress if it is paired with the assumption that an earlier volition is needed in order for the first volition to constitute an action. This is why &quot;volitionists&quot; often hold that volitions cause actions or are parts of actions but are not full actions themselves.

=== Physical and mental ===
Philosophers have investigated the concept of actions mostly in regard to physical actions, which are usually understood in terms of bodily movements. It is not uncommon among philosophers to understand bodily movements as the only form of action. Some volitionists, on the other hand, claim that all actions are mental because they consist in volitions. But this position involves various problems, as explained in the corresponding section above. However, there is a middle path possible between these two extreme positions that allows for the existence of both physical and mental actions. Various mental events have been suggested as candidates for non-physical actions, like imagining, judging or remembering.

One influential account of mental action comes from Galen Strawson, who holds that mental actions consist in &quot;triggering the delivery of content to one&#x27;s field of consciousness&quot;. According to this view, the events of imagining, judging or remembering are not mental actions strictly speaking but they can be the products of mental actions. Mental actions, in the strict sense, are &quot;prefatory&quot; or &quot;catalytic&quot;: they consist in preparing the mind for these contents to arise. They foster hospitable conditions but cannot ensure that the intended contents will appear. Strawson uses the analogy of jumping off a wall, in which the jumping itself (corresponding to the triggering) is considered an action, but the falling (corresponding to the entertaining of a content) is not an action anymore since it is outside the agent&#x27;s control. Candace L. Upton and Michael Brent object that this account of mental actions is not complete. Taking their lead from mental activities taking place during meditation, they argue that Strawson&#x27;s account leaves out various forms of mental actions, like maintaining one&#x27;s attention on an object or removing a content from consciousness.

One reason for doubting the existence of mental actions is that mental events often appear to be involuntary responses to internal or external stimuli and therefore not under our control. Another objection to the existence of mental actions is that the standard account of actions in terms of intentions seems to fail for mental actions. The problem here is that the intention to think about something already needs to include the content of the thought. So the thought is no longer needed since the intention already &quot;thinks&quot; the content. This leads to a vicious regress since another intention would be necessary to characterize the first intention as an action. An objection not just to mental actions but to the distinction between physical and mental actions arises from the difficulty of finding strict criteria to distinguish the two.

== Related concepts ==
=== Deliberation and decision ===
&quot;Deliberations&quot; and &quot;decisions&quot; are relevant for actions since they frequently precede the action. It is often the case that several courses of action are open to the agent. In such cases, deliberation performs the function of evaluating the different options by weighing the reasons for and against them. Deciding then is the process of picking one of these alternatives and forming an intention to perform it, thereby leading toward an action.

=== Explanation and rationality ===
&quot;Explanations&quot; can be characterized as answers to why-questions. Explanations of actions are concerned with why the agent performed the action. The most straightforward answer to this question cites the agent&#x27;s desire. For example, John went to the fridge &quot;because&quot; he had a desire for ice cream. The agent&#x27;s beliefs are another relevant feature for action explanation. So the desire to have ice cream does not explain that John went to the fridge unless it is paired with John&#x27;s belief that there is ice cream in the fridge. The desire together with the belief is often referred to as the &quot;reason&quot; for the action. &quot;Causalist theories&quot; of action usually hold that this reason explains the action because it &quot;causes&quot; the action.

Behavior that does not have a reason is not an action since it is not intentional. Every action has a reason but not every action has a good reason. Only actions with good reasons are considered &quot;rational&quot;. For example, John&#x27;s action of going to the fridge would be considered irrational if his reason for this is bad, e.g. because his belief that there is ice cream in the fridge is merely based on wishful thinking.

=== Responsibility ===
The problem of &quot;responsibility&quot; is closely related to the philosophy of actions since we usually hold people responsible for what they do. But in one sense the problem of responsibility is wider since we can be responsible not just for doing something but for failing to do something, so-called omissions. For example, a pedestrian witnessing a terrible car accident may be morally responsible for calling an ambulance and for providing help directly if possible. Additionally to what the agent did, it is also relevant what the agent could have done otherwise, i.e. what powers and capacities the agent had. The agent&#x27;s intentions are also relevant for responsibility, but we can be responsible for things we did not intend. For example, a chain smoker may have a negative impact on the health of the people around him. This is a side-effect of his smoking that is not part of his intention. The smoker may still be responsible for this damage, either because he was aware of this side-effect and decided to ignore it or because he should have been aware of it, so-called negligence.

=== Perception ===
In the theory of enactivism, perception is understood to be sensorimotor in nature. That is, we carry out actions as an essential part of perceiving the world. Alva Noë states:
&#x27;We move our eyes, head and body in taking in what is around us... [we]: crane our necks, peer, squint, reach for our glasses or draw near to get a better look...&#x27;...&#x27;Perception is a mode of activity on the part of the whole animal...It cannot be represented in terms of merely passive, and internal, processes...&#x27; 

=== Problem of mental causation ===
Some philosophers (e.g. Donald Davidson) have argued that the mental states the agent invokes as justifying his action are physical states that cause the action. Problems have been raised for this view because the mental states seem to be reduced to mere physical causes. Their mental properties don&#x27;t seem to be doing any work. If the reasons an agent cites as justifying his action, however, are not the cause of the action, they must explain the action in some other way or be causally impotent. Those who hold the belief that mental properties are reducible to physical properties are known as token-identity reductionists. Some have disagreed with the conclusion that this reduction means the mental explanations are causally impotent while still maintaining that the reduction is possible. For example, Dretske has put forward the viewpoint of reasons as structuring causes. This viewpoint maintains that the relation, intentional properties that are created in the process of justifying one&#x27;s actions are causally potent in that the process is an instance of action. When considering that actions are causally potent, Dretske claims that the process of justifying one&#x27;s actions is necessarily part of the causal system. Others have objected to the belief that mental states can cause physical action without asserting that mental properties can be reduced to physical properties. Such individuals suggest that mental states are epiphenomenal, in that they have no impact on physical states, but are nonetheless distinct entities (see epiphenomenalism).

<text>Jascha Horenstein (;  – 2 April 1973) was an American conductor.

==Biography==
Horenstein was born in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine), into a well-to-do Jewish family; his mother (Marie Ettinger) came from an Austrian rabbinical family and his father (Abraham Horenstein) was Russian.

His family moved to Königsberg in 1906 and then to Vienna in 1911 and he studied at the Vienna Academy of Music starting in 1916, with Joseph Marx (music theory) and Franz Schreker (composition).

In 1920, he moved to Berlin and worked as an assistant to Wilhelm Furtwängler. During the 1920s he conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic. He became principal conductor of the Düsseldorf Opera in 1928, and then the company&#x27;s Generalmusikdirektor in 1929. He had to resign his post in March 1933 after the rise of the Nazi Party. His Düsseldorf tenure was the only permanent musical directorship in his career. Forced as a Jew to flee the Nazis, he moved to the United States in 1940, and eventually became an American citizen. He taught at the New School for Social Research while in New York City.

==Repertoire==
Horenstein is particularly remembered as a champion of modern music and as a Mahler conductor, although his repertory as shown by his discography was quite wide. In 1929 he conducted the premiere of three movements of Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; in an arrangement for string orchestra. In 1950, he conducted the first Paris performance of Berg&#x27;s &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

Horenstein conducted the works of Bruckner and Mahler throughout his career, and he also displayed ongoing interest in Carl Nielsen, whom he knew personally, at a time when these composers were unfashionable. For example, his 1952 Vox recording of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 was the first studio recording, and the second commercial record, of that work. Several years later, he recorded the original version of Bruckner&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. He made studio recordings of several of Mahler&#x27;s symphonies at various points in his career, including Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3 with the London Symphony Orchestra. A number of radio archives hold broadcast airchecks of many of the other Mahler symphonies, as well as &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;. In recent years, several of Horenstein&#x27;s concert performances have been reissued on the BBC Legends label, including his celebrated 1959 Royal Albert Hall performance of Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 and his 1972 performance of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; at Free Trade Hall, Manchester.

Horenstein also recorded Robert Simpson&#x27;s Third Symphony and music by Paul Hindemith and Richard Strauss during the last few years of his life. His opera recordings included Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Saul og David&quot;. His final operatic, and British, engagement was his March 1973 performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

It was during a performance of Nielsen&#x27;s Fifth Symphony in Minneapolis in 1971 that Horenstein suffered a heart attack and was caught in mid-air by the leader of the orchestra. Though warned by his doctors to reduce his workload, he continued to conduct. At the time of his death, he was planning to conduct Mahler&#x27;s Fifth, Sixth and Seventh. His wife Rose died in 1981.

<text>Bernard Johan Herman Haitink (; 4 March 1929 – 21 October 2021) was a Dutch conductor and violinist. He was the principal conductor of several international orchestras, beginning with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1961. He moved to London, as principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1967 to 1979, music director at Glyndebourne Opera from 1978 to 1988 and of the Royal Opera House from 1987 to 2002, when he became principal conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden. Finally, he was principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 2006 to 2010. The focus of his prolific recording was classical symphonies and orchestral works, but he also conducted operas. He conducted 90 concerts at The Proms in London, the last on 3 September 2019 with the Vienna Philharmonic. His awards include Grammy Awards and the 2015 Gramophone Award for his lifetime achievements.

== Early life ==
Haitink was born on 4 March 1929 in Amsterdam, the son of Willem Haitink, a civil servant who later became director of the Amsterdam electricity board, and Anna Clara (Verschaffelt), who worked for Alliance française. He studied the violin and conducting, with Felix Hupka, who conducted the school&#x27;s orchestra, at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam. He then played the violin in orchestras before taking courses in conducting under Ferdinand Leitner in 1954 and 1955.

== Career ==

Haitink conducted his first concert on 19 July 1954 with the Netherlands Radio Union Orchestra (later the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra [RFO]). He became second conductor of the orchestra in 1955 and chief conductor in 1957. His conducting debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra was on 7 November 1956, substituting for Carlo Maria Giulini. After the sudden death of Eduard van Beinum, Haitink was named first conductor of the Concertgebouw on 1 September 1959. He became principal conductor in 1961, sharing that position with Eugen Jochum until 1963, when Haitink became sole principal conductor. With the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Haitink made many recordings for the Philips label, and later for Decca and EMI Classics. He toured widely with the orchestra.

In the early 1980s, Haitink threatened to resign his Concertgebouw post in protest at threatened reductions to its subsidy from the Dutch government, which could have led to the dismissal of 23 musicians from the orchestra. The financial situation was eventually settled, and Haitink remained chief conductor until 1988. In 1999, he was named the honorary conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. In December 2012, following his advocacy for the RFO in the wake of proposed budget cuts to the orchestra and Dutch music in general, Haitink accepted the title of patron of the RFO. In March 2014, Haitink told the Dutch newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; that he wished to renounce the title of RCO conductor laureate and to no longer guest-conduct the orchestra in protest of the orchestra&#x27;s administrative management. In September 2015, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra announced a rapprochement with Haitink, with a scheduled guest-conducting engagement with the orchestra in the 2016–17 season.

Haitink was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1967 to 1979. He was also music director at Glyndebourne Opera in England from 1978 to 1988. He was music director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from 1987 to 2002, where his musicianship was praised, though he also received criticism for his degree of attachment to the organisation as a whole.

From 2002 to 2004, Haitink was chief conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden. His original contract with Dresden ran to 2006, but he resigned in 2004 over disputes with the Staatskapelle&#x27;s Intendant, Gerd Uecker, over the orchestra&#x27;s choice of successor.
Haitink was principal guest conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1995 to 2004, when he took on the new title of conductor emeritus. In addition, he appeared with l&#x27;Orchestre National de France and the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). In the early 2000s, he recorded the complete Beethoven and Brahms symphony cycles with the LSO for the &quot;LSO Live&quot; label. Haitink was an honorary member of the Berlin Philharmonic.

In April 2006, after an acclaimed two-week engagement in March 2006 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO), the CSO appointed Haitink to the newly created position of principal conductor, effective from the 2006–07 season. The contract&#x27;s duration was four years. Haitink had declined the CSO&#x27;s offer to be music director, citing his age. Of this contract, Haitink said, &quot;every conductor, including myself, has a sell-by date.&quot; He concluded his Chicago principal conductorship in June 2010 with a series of concerts of the complete Beethoven symphonies and was awarded the Theodore Thomas Medallion by the orchestra.

In 2004, Haitink said he would no longer conduct opera, but he made exceptions in 2007, directing three performances of &quot;Parsifal&quot; in Zürich in March and April and five of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in Paris (Théâtre des Champs-Élysées) in June. Also in 2004 he said he did not plan to conduct again at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, but he returned to the Royal Opera in December 2007, with the same Zurich production of &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

Haitink led master classes for young conductors in Lucerne for several years. In June 2015, the European Union Youth Orchestra announced his appointment as its conductor laureate, effective immediately.

In June 2019, Haitink said in an interview with the Dutch daily &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; that his final concert as conductor was to be in September 2019, formalising his previously announced sabbatical into retirement. His final concert with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra was on 15 June 2019. His final UK concert was at The Proms in London on 3 September, 2019, with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. His last concert was in Lucerne at the KKL on 6 September 2019, with the Vienna Philharmonic.

== Personal life ==
Haitink had five children with Marjolein Snijder, his first wife. Their marriage ended in the 1970s. Two further marriages, both to musicians, also ended in divorce. In 1994 Haitink married his fourth wife, Patricia (née Bloomfield), a barrister who was formerly a viola player in the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. They lived in West London.

In 2019, Bärenreiter published the book &quot;Dirigieren ist ein Rätsel&quot; (&quot;Conducting is a Mystery&quot;), a collaboration between Haitink and the journalists Peter Hagmann and Erich Singer that includes personal reflections by Haitink on his life and career.

Haitink died on 21 October 2021, aged 92, at his home in London.

<text>Raymond Davis (March 29, 1940 – July 5, 2005) was the original bass singer and one of the founding members of The Parliaments, and subsequently the bands Parliament, and Funkadelic, collectively known as P-Funk. His regular nickname while he was with those groups was &quot;Sting Ray&quot; Davis. Aside from George Clinton, he was the only original member of the Parliaments not to leave the Parliament-Funkadelic conglomerate in 1977. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

==Biography==
He was born in Sumter, South Carolina to Julius and Carrie Bell (Pack) Davis, and worked with Roger Troutman and Zapp in the early to mid-1980s. His distinctive bass can be heard on &quot;I Can Make You Dance,&quot; and &quot;Do Wa Ditty.&quot; He was also briefly in a later period line-up of The Temptations, joining after the death of original bass singer Melvin Franklin, and appearing on the 1995 album &quot;For Lovers Only.&quot; Davis left the group after being diagnosed with throat cancer. In later years, he performed with former Temptation Glenn Leonard in Leonard&#x27;s group, The Temptations Experience. And in 1998, along with original Parliament-Funkadelic members Clarence &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haskins, Calvin Simon, and &quot;Shady Grady&quot; Thomas, he formed the Original P.

Davis died in New Brunswick, New Jersey on July 5, 2005, at the age of 65, of respiratory problems.
