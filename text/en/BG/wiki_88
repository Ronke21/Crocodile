<text>Robert Michael Mapplethorpe ( ; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American photographer, best known for his black-and-white photographs. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female nudes, self-portraits, and still-life images. His most controversial works documented and examined the gay male BDSM subculture of New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 

Mapplethorpe&#x27;s 1989 exhibition, &quot;Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment&quot;, sparked a debate in the United States concerning both use of public funds for &quot;obscene&quot; artwork and the Constitutional limits of free speech in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Mapplethorpe was born in the Floral Park neighborhood of Queens, New York City, the son of Joan Dorothy (Maxey) and Harry Irving Mapplethorpe, an electrical engineer. He was of English, Irish, and German descent, and grew up as a Catholic at Our Lady of the Snows Parish. Mapplethorpe attended Martin Van Buren High School, where he graduated in 1963. He had three brothers and two sisters. One of his brothers, Edward, later worked for him as an assistant and became a photographer as well. He attended the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where he majored in Graphic Arts, but dropped out in 1969 before finishing his degree.

==Career==
Mapplethorpe lived with his girlfriend, the artist and musician Patti Smith, from 1967 to 1972, and she supported him by working in bookstores. They created art together, and maintained a close friendship throughout Mapplethorpe&#x27;s life. Mapplethorpe took his first photographs in the late 1960s or early 1970s using a Polaroid camera. He also designed and sold his own jewelry, which was worn by Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro. During this period Mapplethorpe also produced drawings, collages, and found object sculptures. 
In 1972, Mapplethorpe met art curator Sam Wagstaff, who would become his mentor, lover, patron, and lifetime companion. In the mid-1970s, Wagstaff acquired a Hasselblad medium-format camera and Mapplethorpe began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including artists, composers, and socialites. During this time, he became friends with New Orleans artist George Dureau, whose work had such a profound impact on Mapplethorpe that he restaged many of Dureau&#x27;s early photographs. From 1977 until 1980, Mapplethorpe was the lover of writer and &quot;Drummer&quot; editor Jack Fritscher, who introduced him to the Mineshaft (a members-only BDSM gay leather bar and sex club in Manhattan). Mapplethorpe took many pictures of the Mineshaft and was at one point its official photographer (… &quot;After dinner I go to the Mineshaft.&quot;)
By the 1980s, Mapplethorpe&#x27;s subject matter focused on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and highly formal portraits of artists and celebrities. Mapplethorpe&#x27;s first studio was at 24 Bond Street in Manhattan. In the 1980s, Wagstaff bought a top-floor loft at 35 West 23rd Street for Robert, where he resided, also using it as a photo-shoot studio. He kept the Bond Street loft as his darkroom. In 1988, Mapplethorpe selected Patricia Morrisroe to write his biography, which was based on more than 300 interviews with celebrities, critics, lovers, and Mapplethorpe himself.
==Death==
On March 9, 1989, Mapplethorpe died at age 42 due to complications from HIV/AIDS in a Boston hospital. His body was cremated, and his ashes are interred at St. John&#x27;s Cemetery, Queens in New York City, at his mother&#x27;s gravesite, etched &quot;Maxey&quot;.

==Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation==
Nearly a year before his death, the ailing Mapplethorpe helped found the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc. His vision for the Foundation was that it would be &quot;the appropriate vehicle to protect his work, to advance his creative vision, and to promote the causes he cared about&quot;. Since his death, the Foundation has not only functioned as his official estate and helped promote his work throughout the world, but has also raised and donated millions of dollars to fund medical research in the fight against AIDS and HIV infection. In 1991, the Foundation received the Large Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards. The Foundation donated $1 million towards the 1993 establishment of the Robert Mapplethorpe Residence, a six-story townhouse for long-term residential AIDS treatment on East 17th Street in New York City, in partnership with Beth Israel Medical Center. The residence closed in 2015, citing financial difficulties. The Foundation also promotes fine art photography at the institutional level. The Foundation helps determine which galleries represent Mapplethorpe&#x27;s art. In 2011, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation donated the , spanning from 1970 to 1989, to the Getty Research Institute.

==Art==
Mapplethorpe worked primarily in a studio, and almost exclusively produced black-and-white photography, with the exception of some of his later work and his final exhibit &quot;New Colors&quot;. His body of work features a wide range of subjects and the greater part of his work is on erotic imagery. He would refer to some of his own work as pornographic, with the aim of arousing the viewer, but which could also be regarded as high art. His erotic art explored a wide range of sexual subjects, depicting the BDSM subculture of New York in the 1970s, portrayals of black male nudes, and classical nudes of female bodybuilders. One of the black models he worked with regularly was Derrick Cross, whose pose for the self-titled image in 1983 has been compared to the &quot;Farnese Hercules.&quot; Mapplethorpe was a participant observer for much of his erotic photography, participating in the sexual acts which he was photographing and engaging his models sexually.
Other subjects included flowers, especially orchids and calla lilies, children, statues, and celebrities and other artists, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Debbie Harry, Susan Sontag, Kathy Acker, Richard Gere, Peter Gabriel, Grace Jones, Amanda Lear, Laurie Anderson, Iggy Pop, Philip Glass, David Hockney, Cindy Sherman, Joan Armatrading, and Patti Smith. Smith was a longtime lover/live-in girlfriend of Mapplethorpe and a frequent subject in his photography, including a stark, iconic photograph that appears on the cover of Smith&#x27;s first album, &quot;Horses&quot;. His work often made reference to religious or classical imagery, such as a 1975 portrait of Patti Smith from 1986 which recalls Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s 1500 self-portrait. Between 1980 and 1983, Mapplethorpe created over 150 photographs of bodybuilder Lisa Lyon, culminating in the 1983 photobook &quot;Lady, Lisa Lyon&quot;, published by Viking Press and with text by Bruce Chatwin.


==Controversy==
===&quot;The Perfect Moment&quot; (1989 solo exhibit tour)===
In the summer of 1989, a traveling solo exhibit by Mapplethorpe brought national attention to the issues of public funding for the arts, as well as questions of censorship and the obscene. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., agreed to be one of the host museums for the tour. Mapplethorpe decided to show his latest series that he explored shortly before his death. Titled &quot;Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment&quot;, the show included photographs from his X Portfolio, which featured images of urophagia, gay BDSM and a self-portrait with a bullwhip inserted in his anus. It also featured photos of two children with exposed genitals. 

The show was curated by Janet Kardon of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia. The ICA was awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support Mapplethorpe&#x27;s exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The Corcoran cancelled the show, terminating its contract with the ICA, because it did not want to get involved in the political issues that it raised, but instead the gallery was pulled into the controversy, which &quot;intensified the debate waged both in the media and in Congress surrounding the NEA&#x27;s funding of projects perceived by some individuals...to be inappropriate.&quot; The hierarchy of the Corcoran and several members of the United States Congress were upset when the works were revealed to them, due to the homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes of some of the work. Though much of his work throughout his career had been regularly displayed in publicly funded exhibitions, conservative and religious organizations such as the American Family Association seized on this exhibition to vocally oppose government support for what they called &quot;nothing more than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material.&quot;
In June 1989, pop artist Lowell Blair Nesbitt became involved in the censorship issue. Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5-million bequest to the museum in his will, but publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition, he would revoke the bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the Phillips Collection instead. After the Corcoran refused the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit Washington Project for the Arts, which showed all the images in its space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds. In 1990, the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, which had also shown the exhibit, and Dennis Barrie, were charged with obscenity; photographs that depicted men in sadomasochistic poses were the basis of charges that the museum and its director had pandered obscenity. They were found not guilty by a jury.
According to the ICA, &quot;The Corcoran&#x27;s decision sparked a controversial national debate: Should tax dollars support the arts? Who decides what is &#x27;obscene&#x27; or &#x27;offensive&#x27; in public exhibitions? And if art can be considered a form of free speech, is it a violation of the First Amendment to revoke federal funding on grounds of obscenity? To this day, these questions remain very much at issue.&quot; Mapplethorpe became something of a for both sides of the American culture war. However, prices for many of the Mapplethorpe photographs doubled and even tripled as a consequence of all the attention. The artist&#x27;s notoriety supposedly also helped the posthumous sale at Christie&#x27;s auction house of Mapplethorpe&#x27;s own collection of furniture, pottery, silver and works by other artists, which brought about $8 million.
===University of Central England incident===
In 1998, the University of Central England was involved in a controversy when a library book by Mapplethorpe was confiscated. A final-year undergraduate student was writing a paper on the work of Mapplethorpe and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs made from &quot;Mapplethorpe&quot;, a book of the photographer&#x27;s work. She took the film to a local shop to be developed and the staff there informed West Midlands Police because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that two photographs in the book would have to be removed. If the university agreed to the removal (which it did not) the book would be returned. The two photographs, which were deemed possibly prosecutable as obscenity, were &quot;Helmut and Brooks, NYC, 1978&quot;, which shows anal fisting, and &quot;Jim and Tom, Sausalito, 1977&quot;, which is of a man clad in a dog collar, a leather mask and trousers, urinating into another man&#x27;s mouth.&quot; After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Peter Knight, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, was informed that no legal action would be taken. The book was returned to the university library without removal of the photographs.

=== &quot;The Black Book&quot; ===
The 1986 solo exhibition &quot;Black Males&quot; and the subsequent book &quot;The Black Book&quot; sparked controversy for their depiction of black men. The images, erotic depictions of black men, were widely criticized for being exploitative. The work was largely phallocentric and sculptural, focusing on segments of the subject&#x27;s bodies. His purported intention with these photographs and the use of black men as models was the pursuit of the Platonic ideal. Mapplethorpe&#x27;s initial interest in the black male form was inspired by films like &quot;Mandingo&quot; and the interrogation scene in &quot;Cruising,&quot; in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.
Criticism was the subject of a work by American conceptual artist Glenn Ligon,&quot; Notes on the Margins of the Black Book&quot; (1991–1993). Ligon juxtaposes Mapplethorpe&#x27;s 91 images of black men in the 1988 publication &quot;Black Book&quot; with critical texts and personal reactions about the work to complicate the racial undertones of the imagery.
American poet and activist Essex Hemphill also expressed criticism in his anthology &quot;Brother to Brother&quot; (1991). Although he believed that Mapplethorpe&#x27;s work reflected exceptional talent, Hemphill also believed that it displayed a lack of concern for gay black men, &quot;except as sexual subjects&quot;.
== Posthumously ==
In 1992, author Paul Russell dedicated his novel &quot;Boys of Life&quot; to Mapplethorpe, as well as to Karl Keller and Pier Paolo Pasolini.
When &quot;Mapplethorpe: A Biography&quot; by Patricia Morrisroe was published by Random House in 1995, the &quot;Washington Post Book World&quot; described it as &quot;Mesmerizing ... Morrisroe has succeeded in re-creating the photographer&#x27;s world of light and dark.&quot; Art critic Arthur C. Danto, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, praised it as &quot;utterly admirable ... The clarity and honesty of Morrisroe&#x27;s portrait are worthy of its subject.&quot;
Patti Smith published books titled &quot;The Coral Sea&quot; (1996) and &quot;Just Kids&quot; (2010). Both were dedicated to Mapplethorpe, and the latter won the 2010 National Book Award for Nonfiction.
In September 1999, Arena Editions published &quot;Pictures,&quot; a monograph that reintroduced Mapplethorpe&#x27;s sex pictures. In 2000, &quot;Pictures&quot; was seized by two South Australian plain-clothes detectives from an Adelaide bookshop in the belief that the book breached indecency and obscenity laws. Police sent the book to the Canberra-based Office of Film and Literature Classification after the state Attorney-General&#x27;s Department deftly decided not to get involved in the mounting publicity storm. Eventually, the OFLC board agreed unanimously that the book, imported from the United States, should remain freely available and unrestricted.
In May 2007, American writer, director, and producer James Crump directed the documentary film &quot;Black White + Gray&quot;, which premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. It explores the influence Mapplethorpe, curator Sam Wagstaff, and Patti Smith had on the 1970s art scene in New York City.
In September 2007, Prestel published &quot;Mapplethorpe: Polaroids&quot;, a collection of 183 of approximately 1,500 existing Mapplethorpe polaroids. This book accompanies an exhibition by the Whitney Museum of American Art in May 2008.
In 2008, Robert Mapplethorpe was named by Equality Forum as one of its 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month.
In June 2016, Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons debuted his men&#x27;s Spring 2017 collection inspired by Mapplethorpe&#x27;s work and featuring several of his photographs printed onto shirts, jackets, and smocks.
The American documentary film, &quot;,&quot; was released in 2016. It was directed and executive produced by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, and produced by Katharina Otto-Bernstein.
In January 2016, filmmaker Ondi Timoner announced that she was directing a feature about him, &quot;Mapplethorpe,&quot; with Matt Smith in the lead role. The film premiered on April 22, 2018, at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.
In 2019 and 2020, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City hosted &quot;Implicit Tensions&quot;, an exhibition of many of Mapplethorpe&#x27;s works.
In collaboration with the Mapplethorpe Foundation, jeweler Gaia Repossi created a jewelry collection inspired by Mapplethorpe in 2021.

In 2022, Isaac Cole Powell played a character in American Horror Story: NYC named &#x27;Theo Graves&#x27; loosely inspired by Mapplethorpe&#x27;s life as an erotic photographer, relationship with his mentor and art curator Sam Wagstaff, and death from HIV/AIDS complications.
=== Art market ===
In 2017, a 1987 Mapplethorpe self-portrait platinum print was auctioned for £450,000, making it the most expensive Mapplethorpe photograph ever sold.

In April 2023, Phillips auctioned &quot;Man in Polyester Suit&quot; (1980) for an above-estimate $355,600.

<text>A sexual fantasy or erotic fantasy is an autoerotic mental image or pattern of thought that stirs a person&#x27;s sexuality and can create or enhance sexual arousal. A sexual fantasy can be created by the person&#x27;s imagination or memory, and may be triggered autonomously or by external stimulation such as erotic literature or pornography, a physical object, or sexual attraction to another person. Anything that may give rise to sexual arousal may also produce a sexual fantasy, and sexual arousal may in turn give rise to fantasies.

Sexual fantasies are nearly universal, being reported in many societies across the globe. However, because of the nature of some fantasies, the actual putting of such fantasies into action is far less common, due to cultural, social, moral, and religious constraints. In some cases, even a discussion by a person of sexual fantasies is subject to social taboos and inhibitions. Some people find it convenient to act out fantasies through sexual roleplay. A fantasy may be a positive or negative experience, or even both. It may be in response to a past experience and can influence future sexual behavior. A person may not wish to enact a sexual fantasy in real life, and since the process is entirely imaginary, they are not limited to acceptable or practical fantasies, which can provide information on the psychological processes behind sexual behavior.

== In art ==
&quot;Sexual fantasy&quot; can also pertain to a genre of literature, film or work of art. Such works may be appreciated for their aesthetics, though many people may feel uncomfortable with such works. For example, women in prison films may be described as sexual fantasies. A person may find validation of a sexual fantasy by viewing the depiction or discussion of a sexual fantasy in film, usually of a pornographic nature. In the case of films, the term may describe a part of the film, such as a fantasy scene or sequence. Besides pornographic films, a number of mainstream films have included sexual fantasy scenes, such as &quot;Business Is Business&quot; (1971), &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) and others. In many cases, the use of fantasy scenes enables the inclusion of material into a work indicating the sexualized mental state of a character.

== Methodology ==
It is difficult to objectively identify and measure the nature of sexual fantasies, so that many studies deal with conscious fantasies when a person is awake, using one of three techniques:
* anonymous respondents are provided with a checklist of fantasies and asking them to indicate which ones they have experienced, how often, and in what context. This method relies on retrospective recall, which may limit its accuracy. A checklist may not be comprehensive, and as a result may be biased towards some fantasies.
* anonymous respondents are asked to write, in narrative form, their sexual fantasies. This method also relies on retrospective recall. Some studies limit the number of fantasies entered (such as only the most frequent ones), and respondents may not write down all of their fantasies anyway—they may forget infrequent fantasies, not want to write too many down, or be more subject to social desirability bias than with a checklist.
* respondents record the fantasies they experience over a given period of time using checklists or diaries. This method requires a long period of time to be representative, and may be impractical.

To measure the reliability of a person&#x27;s reporting of fantasies, researchers may compare a person&#x27;s reported sexual arousal against actual measures of arousal, using techniques such as vaginal photoplethysmography, penile strain gauges, or other tools, such as genital pulse amplitude, genital blood volume, and heart rate. A 1977 study found that males judged arousal based on blood volume far better than females, and that males and females were equal when judging arousal based on pulse amplitude measures. Additionally, females were better at judging low arousal.

As with studies of sex in general, samples used in studies may be too small, not be fully random, or not fully representative of a population. This makes similarities between studies especially important. Women may be prone to underreporting the frequency of fantasy because they do not realize that they are becoming aroused, or they will not say that they are; one common problem is that they will imagine romantic imagery and become aroused, but not report the fantasy because it is not sexually explicit. Many studies are modern and are carried out in Western society, which, through factors like gender roles and taboo, are not widely representative, raising the need for more studies in different societies and historical eras. With regards to age, there is very little knowledge of sexual fantasies in children aged 5 to 12, and there is a need for longitudinal studies across a life span. Sex is often a taboo topic, so conducting a truly honest and representative example can be difficult in some areas. For example, a 1997 study on South Asian gay men found that almost 75% were afraid of being &quot;found out&quot;, which complicates studies.

== Purposes ==
The scenarios for sexual fantasies vary greatly between individuals and are influenced by personal desires and experiences, and can range from the mundane to the bizarre. Fantasies are frequently used to escape real-life sexual restraints by imagining dangerous or illegal scenarios, such as rape, castration, or kidnapping. They allow people to imagine themselves in roles they do not normally have, such as power, innocence and guilt. Fantasies have enormous influence over sexual behavior and can be the sole cause of an orgasm. While there are several common themes in fantasies, any object or act can be eroticized.

Sexual fantasies are increasingly viewed as a necessary component to a healthy relationship. Accordingly, theorists have argued that fantasies may be used to encourage and promote sexual pleasure between partners. Researchers have additionally found a positive correlation between instances of sexual fantasizing and increased orgasm, arousal, and general contentment. The relative benefits of sexual fantasies are summarized in a statement by Stroller; &quot;sexual fantasies are a private pornography in which we rehearse over and over again needs that are nearly impossible to fulfil in actual sex&quot;. Sexual fantasizing therefore allows an individual to fulfil desires that cannot be realistically achieved. In this sense, researchers assert that fantasizing about extra-marital, or multiple-partner sex is positively correlated with long-term partnerships. As such, sexual fantasies are viewed as means to combat sexual dissatisfaction.

Sexual fantasising may also be used to settle relational hardships, as opposed to sexual dissatisfaction. For instance, women from disturbed marriages were found to fantasise significantly more often than happily married women. Creating hypothetical scenarios may be used as a coping mechanism, particularly by women, in handling stress and discomfort. As such, fantasies allow individuals to enter a new realm (e.g. experience a position of power, innocence, or guilt) that contrasts the source of anguish, and enhances feelings of self-worth.

The purpose and function of sexual fantasies are explained rather differently from an evolutionary perspective. Bowlby&#x27;s (1969/1982) attachment theory asserts that the absence of adequate attachment figures can devastate self-esteem. It is suggested that more anxiously attached individuals use sex to attain emotional security. Accordingly, they might engage in sex through a longing for sexual intimacy, and increase the frequency of sexual behavior under conditions that challenge the status of their relationship. Contrastingly, the avoidant attachment type is apprehensive about the intimacy posed by sexual relations, and will take active measures to avoid feelings of closeness. Patterns of sexual behavior include emotion free sex with casual partners, engaging in sex to promote oneself, and feelings of detachment during intercourse. Sexual fantasies are likely to follow attachment-related themes. It is noted that anxious attachment individuals report significantly more instances of sexual fantasizing, and portray the self as feeble, dependable and powerless. Avoidant attachment types report fantasies in which relationships are regarded as cold, unfeeling and impersonal. As such, sexual fantasies serve the primary function of fulfilling interpersonal goals through the mode of mental representation.

Evolutionary theory provides another interesting explanation as to the purpose and function of gender differences in sexual fantasies.
Research literature states that women are more likely to prioritize their own physical and emotional sensations, where men conjure images of sexual partners. Women are also more likely to fantasize about a single individual with whom they have shared history, or those whom they wish to pursue a long-term relationship. Throughout the course of time, it has proved advantageous for the male to copulate with young and fertile females. They evolved an ability to decipher &quot;fresh features&quot; of reproductive partners; clear skin, thick hair, fuller lips, and so forth. By comparison, females are driven to reproduce on the basis of parental investment, and a quality gene pool possessed by the male. From a female perspective, the risks of copulating with multiple male partners far outweigh any potential benefits. It is therefore unsurprising that males visualize specific physical features; its origins and purpose can be found in evolution. It also follows that where males project outwardly, viewing women and a means to obtain sexual pleasure, women have become conditioned to remain passive in this role. They do so under close scrutiny of male sexual attention, to fantasize a specific and special partner.

A person may have no desire to carry out a fantasy; people often use fantasies to help plan out future sexual encounters. Fantasies occur in all individuals and at any time of the day, although it has been suggested that they are more common among frequent daydreamers. Sexual fantasy is frequent during masturbation, although this may be truer for men than for women.

During sexual contact, some people can use their fantasies to &quot;turn off&quot; undesirable aspects of an act. Conversely, a person may use fantasy to focus and maintain arousal, such as a man receiving fellatio ignoring a distraction. Men tend to be aware of only parts of themselves during sex—they are more likely to focus on the physical stimulation of one area, and as such, do not see themselves as a &quot;whole&quot;.

Many couples share their fantasies to feel closer and gain more intimacy and trust, or simply to become more aroused or effect a more powerful physical response. Some couples share fantasies as a form of outercourse; this has been offered as an explanation for the rise of BDSM during the 1980s — in order to avoid contracting HIV, people turned to BDSM as a safe outlet for sexual fantasy. Couples may also act out their fantasies through sexual roleplay.

Fantasies may also be used as a part of sex therapy. They can enhance insufficiently exciting sexual acts to promote higher levels of sexual arousal and release. A 1986 study that looked at married women indicated that sexual fantasies helped them achieve arousal and orgasm. As a part of therapy, anorgasmic women are commonly encouraged to use fantasy and masturbation.

== Common fantasies ==
The incidence of sexual fantasies is nearly universal, but vary by gender, age, sexual orientation, and society. However, because of a reliance on retrospective recall, as well as response bias and taboo, there is an inherent difficulty in measuring the frequency of types of fantasies. In general, the most common fantasies for men and women are: reliving an exciting sexual experience, imagining sex with a current partner, and imagining sex with a different partner. There is no consistent difference in the popularity of these three categories of fantasies. The next most common fantasies involve oral sex, sex in a romantic location, sexual power or irresistibility, and rape.

According to a 2004 United States survey, the incidence of certain fantasies is higher than the actual performance.

== Gender differences ==
=== Origins of sexual fantasies ===
The sexes have been found to contrast with respect to where their fantasies originate from. Men tend to fantasize about past sexual experiences, whereas women are more likely to conjure an imaginary lover or sexual encounter that they have not experienced previously. Male fantasies tend to focus more on visual imagery and explicit anatomic detail, with men being more interested in visual sexual stimulation and fantasies about casual sex encounters, regardless of sexual orientation.

On the other hand, women&#x27;s fantasies tend to be more focused upon mental sexual stimulation and contain more emotion and connection. Thus, women are more likely to report romantic sexual fantasies that are high in intimacy and affection, for instance associating their male partner with heroism and viewing them as chivalric rescuers. Evolutionary theory offers an explanation for this finding, such that women may be likely to show commitment to their male partner in return for his investment of resources to help raise her offspring, thus increasing offspring chance of survival.

=== Types of sexual fantasies ===
Much research has been conducted which has highlighted several gender differences in sexual fantasies. Some of the patterns which have frequently emerged include men&#x27;s greater tendency to report sexual fantasies falling in the following categories: exploratory, intimate, impersonal, and sadomasochism. Exploratory fantasies include those of homosexual encounters and group sex, whilst fantasies of watching others engage in sexual intercourse and fetishism are classed as impersonal sexual fantasies. Women are also likely to report fantasies involving the same-sex partner, or those with a famous person, although both sexes have been found to prefer intimate fantasies over the other three types outlined, including fantasies of oral sex and sex outdoors.

=== Frequent themes ===
Another way the sexes differ is that men are much more likely to fantasize about having multiple sexual partners (i.e., having threesomes or orgies) compared to women and seek greater partner variation in their sexual fantasies. Evolutionary theory suggests that this may be due to men&#x27;s capacity to produce many offspring at any one time by impregnating multiple females, and thus predicts that males will be much more open to the concept of multiple partnerships in order to increase reproductive success and continue their genetic line.

The sexes also differ in terms of how much they fantasize about dominance and submission. Men fantasize about dominance much more frequently than submission, whereas women fantasize about submission much more frequently than dominance. 
Despite these differences, most individuals do not conform to these gendered sexual stereotypes, and that male sexuality is not innately aggressive, nor is female sexuality inherently passive, and that these stereotypes may decline with age.

Sexual fantasies may instead vary as a result of individual differences, such as personality or learning experiences, and not gender per se. Indeed, it has been suggested that gender differences in sexual fantasies have actually narrowed over time, and may continue to do so, for example with regard to variety of sexual fantasy and the amount of fantasizing reported by each of the sexes.
=== Age ===
The age of first experiencing a sexual fantasy has also been found to differ between the sexes. Males are likely to report this at a younger age, typically between the years of 11 and 13, and describe these as being more explicit in content. Themes that were common to both genders regarding first sexual fantasies included sex with celebrities (such as movie stars), and also teachers. It has been noted that sexual fantasy preferences of the two genders also change as a function of age. For instance, younger men have been found to endorse more fantasies with multiple partners, a trend which declines with age, whilst homosexual fantasies increase slightly. Meanwhile, for women, fantasies with strangers and same-sex partners remain relatively stable across their lifetime.

=== Paraphilic sexual fantasies ===
Sex differences have also been found with regard to paraphilic fantasies (i.e. those which are considered to be atypical). Examples of paraphilic sexual fantasies include incest, voyeurism, transvestic fetishism, sex with animals (see zoophilia), and pedophilia. One study reported that over 60% of men admitted to a sexual fantasy involving intercourse with an underage partner, and 33% of males reported rape fantasies. Along with other sexual fantasies, it is thought that the age of occurrence for paraphilic sexual fantasies is usually before 18 years, although this has been found to vary according to the specific fantasy at hand.

Unusual sexual fantasies are more common in men, with fantasies of urinating on their sexual partner and being urinated on being significantly higher among males. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) states that paraphilias are rarely diagnosed in women, with the exception of sexual masochism. Furthermore, sexual arousal has been found to be greater in men than in women when asked to entertain the thought of engaging in paraphilic sexual activity. It may, however, be the case that paraphilias are reported less often in women because they are under-researched in women. Paraphilic sexual fantasies in females include sexual sadism, exhibitionism, and pedophilia.

=== Execution of sexual fantasies ===
Sexual fantasies may be more likely to be executed in contemporary society due to more liberalized attitudes towards the previously taboo topic of sex, and increased awareness of the variety of sexual experiences that now exist. Women are more likely to act upon their sexual fantasies than men since it has been suggested that they fantasize about sexual activities within their range of experience, which therefore makes them more possible to act out. The link between sexual fantasies involving dominance (e.g. rape fantasies) and likelihood of displaying aggressive behavior in real life has been investigated, with connections being found in relation to sexual crimes committed by men and fantasies of sexual coercion. This may be especially more likely if the individual displays high levels of psychopathic traits.

=== Theoretical frameworks ===
Since numerous variables influence sexual fantasy, the differences between gender can be examined through multiple theoretical frameworks. Social constructionism predicts that sexual socialisation is a strong predictor of sexual fantasy and that gender differences are the result of social influences. From this perspective, it is believed that female sexuality is more malleable since it is influenced to a greater extent by cultural views and expectations regarding how women should think and behave. In contrast, evolutionary theory (also known as evolutionary psychology or sociobiology) predicts that sexual fantasy is predisposed to biological factors. For example, some studies have found that women prefer fantasizing about familiar lovers, whereas male sexual fantasies involve anonymous partners.

A social constructionist explanation may say that this is because women are raised to be chaste and selective with men, whereas evolutionary theory may state that ancestral women preferred the reproductive security of having one partner, such that being faithful to him will result in a greater likelihood of him investing resources in her and her offspring, an idea which is still ingrained in modern women today. Evolutionary psychology can also help to shed light on the finding that females have a higher proportion of sexual fantasies involving a male celebrity. The theory suggests that this mating strategy may have been advantageous for our female ancestors, such that affiliation with a high status male increases offspring survival rate via protection and provision.

== Sexual orientation ==
In 1979, Masters and Johnson carried out one of the first studies on sexual fantasy in homosexual men and women, though their data-collection method is unclear. Their sample consisted of 30 gay men and lesbians, and they found that the five most common fantasies for homosexual men were images of sexual anatomy (primarily the penis and buttocks), forced sexual encounters, an idyllic setting for sex, group sex, and sex with women. A 1985 study found that homosexual men preferred unspecified sexual activity with other men, oral sex, and sex with another man not previously involved. In both studies, homosexual and heterosexual men shared similar fantasies, but with genders switched. A 2006 non-representative study looked at homosexual men in India. It found that when compared to heterosexual male fantasies, homosexual males were more focused on exploratory, intimate, and impersonal fantasies. There were no differences in sadomasochistic fantasies. In general, there was little difference in the top fantasies of homosexual versus heterosexual males. At the time of the study, homosexuality was illegal.

A 2005 study compared heterosexual and homosexual women in the Los Angeles metropolitan area and found some differences in the content of their fantasies. In gender-specific findings, homosexual women had more fantasies about specific parts of a woman (face, breasts, clitoris, vagina, buttocks, arms or hair), while heterosexual women had more fantasies about specific parts of a man&#x27;s body (face, penis, buttocks, arms or hair). Homosexual women also had more fantasies of &quot;delighting many women&quot;; there was no significant difference when subjects were asked if they fantasized about delighting many men. There was no significant difference in responses to questions that were not gender-specific.

== Force ==

Rape or ravishment is a common sexual fantasy among both men and women, either generically or as an ingredient in a particular sexual scenario. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced or coerced into sexual activity or as the perpetrator. Some studies have found that women tend to fantasize about being forced into sex more commonly than men. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer found that being &quot;overpowered or forced to surrender&quot; was the second most frequent fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study&#x27;s most common fantasy during intercourse; and a 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex. Other studies have found the theme, but with lower frequency and popularity. However, these female fantasies in no way imply that the subject desires to be raped in reality—the fantasies often contain romantic images where the woman imagines herself being seduced, and the male that she imagines is desirable. Most importantly, the woman remains in full control of her fantasy. The fantasies do not usually involve the woman getting hurt. Conversely, some women who have been sexually victimized in the past report unwanted sexual fantasies, similar to flashbacks of their victimization. They are realistic, and the woman may recall the physical and psychological pain involved.

The most frequently cited hypothesis for why women fantasize of being forced into some sexual activity is that the fantasy avoids societally induced guilt—the woman does not have to admit responsibility for her sexual desires and behavior. A 1978 study by Moreault and Follingstad was consistent with this hypothesis, and found that women with high levels of sex guilt were more likely to report fantasy themed around being overpowered, dominated, and helpless. In contrast, Pelletier and Herold used a different measure of guilt and found no correlation. Other research suggests that women who report forced sex fantasies have a more positive attitude towards sexuality, contradicting the guilt hypothesis. A 1998 study by Strassberg and Lockerd found that women who fantasized about force were generally less guilty and more erotophilic, and as a result had more frequent and more varied fantasies. Additionally, it said that force fantasies are clearly not the most common or the most frequent.

== Social views ==
Social views on sexual fantasy (and sex in general) differ throughout the world. The privacy of a person&#x27;s fantasy is influenced greatly by social conditions. Because of the taboo status of sexual fantasies in many places around the world, open discussion—or even acknowledgment—is forbidden, forcing fantasies to stay private. In more lax conditions, a person may share their fantasies with close friends, significant others, or a group of people with whom the person is comfortable.

The moral acceptance and formal study of sexual fantasy in Western culture is relatively new. Prior to their acceptance, sexual fantasies were seen as evil or sinful, and they were commonly seen as horrid thoughts planted into the minds of people by &quot;agents of the devil&quot;. Even when psychologists were willing to accept and study fantasies, they showed little understanding and went so far as to diagnose sexual fantasies in females as a sign of hysteria. Prior to the early twentieth century, many experts viewed sexual fantasy (particularly in females) as abnormal. Sigmund Freud suggested that those who experienced sexual fantasies were sexually deprived or frustrated or that they lacked adequate sexual stimulation and satisfaction. Over several decades, sexual fantasies became more acceptable as notable works and compilations, such as &quot;Morality, Sexual Facts and Fantasies&quot;, by Dr Patricia Petersen, Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s Kinsey Reports, &quot;Erotic Fantasies: A Study of the Sexual Imagination&quot; by Phyllis and Eberhard Kronhausen, and Nancy Friday&#x27;s &quot;My Secret Garden&quot;, were published. Today, they are regarded as natural and positive elements of one&#x27;s sexuality, and are often used to enhance sexual practices, both in normal settings and in therapy. Many Christians believe that the Bible prohibits sexual fantasies about people other than one&#x27;s spouse in Matthew 5:28. Others believe that St Paul includes fantasy when he condemns works of the flesh such as &quot;immorality&quot; or &quot;uncleanness&quot;. Despite the Western World&#x27;s relatively lax attitudes towards sexual fantasy, many people elsewhere still feel shame and guilt about their fantasies. This may contribute to personal sexual dysfunction, and regularly leads to a decline in the quality of a couple&#x27;s sex life.

== Guilt and jealousy ==
While most people do not feel guilt or disgust about their sexual thoughts or fantasies, a substantial number do. In general, men and women are equally represented in samples of those who felt guilt about their fantasies. The most notable exception was found in a 1991 study that showed that women felt more guilt and disgust about their first sexual fantasies. In women, greater guilt about sex was associated with less frequent and less varied sexual fantasies, and in men, it was associated with less sexual arousal during fantasies. Women also reported more intense guilt than men; both sexes reported greater guilt if their arousal and orgasm depended on a fantasy.

Studies have also been carried out to examine the direct connection between guilt and sexual fantasy, as opposed to sex and guilt. One study found that in a sample of 160 conservative Christians, 16% of men and women reported guilt after sexual fantasies, 5% were unhappy with themselves, and 45% felt that their fantasies were &quot;morally flawed or unacceptable&quot;. Studies that examined guilt about sexual fantasy by age have unclear results—Knoth et al. (1998) and Ellis and Symons (1990) found that younger people tended to feel less guilt about their fantasies, whereas Mosher and White (1980) found the opposite.

A 2006 study examined guilt and jealousy in American heterosexual married couples. It associated guilt with an individual&#x27;s fantasy (&quot;&quot;How guilty do you feel when you fantasize about...&quot;) and jealousy with the partner&#x27;s fantasy (&quot;How jealous do you feel when your partner fantasizes about...&quot;&quot;). Higher levels of guilt were found among women, couples in the 21–29 age range, shorter relationships and marriages, Republicans, and Roman Catholics; lower levels in men, couples in the 41–76 range, longer relationships, Democrats, and Jews. Higher levels of jealousy were found in women, couples in the 21–29 range, Roman Catholics and non-Jewish religious affiliations; lower levels were found in men, couples in the 41–76 range, and Jews and the non-religious.

== Sexual crimes ==
=== Deviant sexual fantasies ===
Deviant sexual fantasies are sexual fantasies which involve illegal, nonconsensual, and sadistic themes. While people with paraphilia have deviant sexual fantasies, deviant sexual fantasies are not atypical and/or paraphilic. DSM-5 defines paraphilia as intense and persistent atypical preferences for sexual activities or targets like spanking, whipping, binding with erotic targets like children, animals, and/or rubber etc. While DSM-5 recognizes that paraphillias do not have to be pathological, psychiatrists still find it difficult to differentiate between paraphilic interests and paraphilic disorders, because the concept of normal of sexual fantasies is subjective. It is based on factors like history, society, culture and politics. For example, masturbation, oral, anal and homosexual sex were once illegal in some American states and even considered to be paraphilic disorders in earlier DSM revisions.

When a study used statistical analysis and the Wilson sex fantasy questionnaire to investigate atypical fantasies, having zoophilllic or pedophillic fantasies were found to be rare and only 7 themes including urination, crossdressing, rape etc. were considered atypical. A lot of studies have also found that &quot;atypical&quot; sexual fantasies are quite common as indulging in greater varieties of sexual fantasies increases sex-life satisfaction. For example, in 2011 study found that over half of the older men in Berlin had &quot;atypical&quot; sexual fantasies with 21.8% of them having sadistic fantasies–a prerequisite for sexual murders. Another study found that dominance and submission themes were extremely popular in pornographic searches.

=== Sexual crimes ===
Most research into sexual crimes involve men. Sexual crimes such as sexual homicides are quite rare because most deviant sexual fantasizers never engaged in deviant sexual behaviors and are not at risk of engaging in sexual crimes. Some have suggested that the frequency of sexual crimes is underestimated due to the narrowness of the legal definition of sexual homicides. The investigations of sexual crimes face several limitations such as the &quot;definitions of sexual crimes, how and where the crimes are committed, incomplete or inaccurate information due to offender&#x27;s motive to exaggerate, legal restrictions&quot; and researchers&#x27; approaches (the essentialist-descriptive approach or phenomenological descriptive approach).

=== Risk factors ===
Deviant and sadistic sexual fantasies are believed to be the underlying risk factors for sexual crimes. 70–85% of sexual offenders extensively engage in deviant sexual fantasies, and certain themes can be attributed to types of sex crimes. For example, serial sexual murderers have more rape fantasies than non-serial sexual murderers and 82% of offenders that use a weapon engage in violent sexual fantasies. Offenders that report deviant sexual fantasies have also been found to be more dangerous than offenders that do not.

Other risk factors that contribute to the likelihood of sex crimes include biological, physiological and psychological factors like mental disorders (especially paranoia and psychosis); violent history, arrests, poor academic performance, substance abuse, financial gain, unemployment, and watching pornography. However, it is usually the combination of childhood sexual abuse and deviant fantasies that facilitate the jump from sexual fantasies to sexual crimes and the nature of the crimes. For example, most rapists report both early traumatic experiences and sexually deviant fantasies and sex murderers of children reported a significantly more pre-crime childhood sexual abuse and deviant sexual fantasies than sexual murderers of women.
=== Sadistic sexual fantasies ===
Sadistic themes are consistently present in the sexual fantasies of offenders across various types of sexual crimes and varying risk factors. They typically involve finding victims, causing harm/pain during sexual intercourse and feelings of grandiosity/omnipotence during arousal.

They occur in high prevalence alongside other paraphilic fantasies in psychopaths and individuals with dark triad traits. High narcissism correlate strongly with impersonal sexual fantasies and studies suggested that the deviant and sadistic sexual fantasies serve as a coping mechanism for narcissistic vulnerability. Higher levels of psychopathy are associated with, impersonal, unrestricted, deviant, paraphilic and wide ranges of sexual fantasies. However, it has been suggested that this is due to an increased sex drive, which correlates with paraphilic interests. Also, psychopathy increases the effect that porn has on the development of deviant fantasies such its contribution to the likelihood of engaging in rape fantasies. The effects of psychopathy go further to increase likelihood of individuals carrying out their unrestricted deviant fantasies in real life such as engaging in BDSM/sadomasochism or even rape. However, BDSM fantasies have become quite common among the general population, possibly due to its normalization by the popular Fifty Shades trilogy. The capitalization of the Fifty Shades trilogy changed the perception of BDSM from being extreme, marginalized and dangerous to being fun, fashionable, and exciting. Mainstreaming Fifty Shades has increased visibility and acceptability of BDSM and has embedded it in everyday life.

=== Sadistic sexual fantasies and crime ===
Sadistic sexual fantasy is one of the key factors for understanding serial killers. Their sexual crimes are &quot;tryouts&quot; that maintain and develop their fantasies; i.e. they commit crimes according to their fantasies, then incorporate the crimes into their fantasies to increase arousal and subsequently develop its sadistic content.

A lot of sexual homicides are well planned due to extensive practice in form of sexual fantasies. The murders involve the infliction of a lot of pain and terror and this serves to satisfy the sadistic fantasy, albeit only temporarily. They start trying to replicate their fantasies more accurately with practice and will continue until they are caught as a fantasy can never be replicated with 100% accuracy.

Childhood abuse plays a significant role in determining if sadistic fantasies will be tried out in real life. Most sexual offenders that suffered childhood sexual abuse reveal an early onset of rape fantasies, and sexual concerns like sexual conflict, incompetence, inhibitions, ignorance and social dysfunction. These concerns cause stress and the offender relies on their deviant fantasies as a coping mechanism for their stress. The unsuccessful resolution of the aforementioned issues causes an obsession with their fantasy world, where they feel in control. They become heavily invested in their deviant fantasies and when their fantasies start to lose their effectiveness due to desensitization or repression, they escalate and start actualizing their fantasies to relieve internal stress. They plan their crimes to feel arousal or commit violent compulsive murders. Violent compulsive crimes are impulsive and occur because resistance and restrictions that prevent violent and sadistic fantasies from being acted out, can lead to anxiety or psychosomatic manifestations. These manifestations then cause uncontrollable desires to act out one&#x27;s fantasy in order to find relief.

Researchers found that the sadistic contents in fantasies began appearing about 1–7 years after the start of masturbation. Due to social awkwardness, most offenders lacked the opportunity to practice their sexual skills with a desired partner or gender and this contributes significantly to their reliance on their fantasies. Eventually, their fantasies and &quot;tryouts&quot; become their only source of arousal.

Some studies suggest that deviant sexual scripts might be learnt through social learning theory due to an early exposure via sexual molestation and reinforcements by orgasms and masturbation. However, not all sexually molested children grow up to be offenders unable to stop themselves from acting out their fantasies. MacCulloch and colleagues have suggested that the early traumatic experiences cause the early development of sadistic fantasies through sensory preconditioning and this might be the reason offenders find it too difficult to restrain themselves from trying out their sadistic fantasies in real life. While some might argue cognitive distortions as the cause of sexual crimes such as pedophilia, evidence suggests that cognitive distortions are used to justify actions after caught and do not motivate them.

<doc id="320721" wikidata="Q1137694" url="?curid=320721" title="Order of the Companions of Honour">
<text>The Order of the Companions of Honour is an order of the Commonwealth realms. It was founded on 4 June 1917 by King George V as a reward for outstanding achievements. It was founded on the same date as the Order of the British Empire.

The order was originally intended to be conferred upon a limited number of persons for whom this special distinction seemed to be the most appropriate form of recognition, constituting an honour dissociated from either the acceptance of title or the classification of merit. It is now described as being &quot;awarded for having a major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government lasting over a long period of time&quot;. The first recipients of the order were all decorated for &quot;services in connection with the war&quot; and were listed in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

==Composition==

The order consists of the monarch of the Commonwealth realms, who is the Sovereign of the Order of the Companions of Honour, and a maximum of 65 members. Additionally, foreigners or Commonwealth citizens from outside the Commonwealth realms may be added as honorary members. Members are organised into a single class and are appointed by the monarch of the Commonwealth realms in their capacity as sovereign of the order. While membership of the order confers no title or precedence, those inducted into the order are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;CH&quot;.

Appointments to the order are generally made on the advice of prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms. For Canadians, the advice to the Sovereign can come from a variety of officials. Originally, the order was limited to 50 ordinary members, but in 1943 it was enlarged to 65, with a quota of 45 members for the United Kingdom, seven for Australia, two each for New Zealand and South Africa, and nine for India, Burma, and the other British colonies. The quota numbers were altered in 1970 to 47 for the United Kingdom, seven for Australia, two for New Zealand, and nine for other Commonwealth realms. The quota was adjusted again in 1975 by adding two places to the New Zealand quota and reducing the nine for the other countries to seven.

Whilst still able to nominate candidates to the order, the Cabinet of Australia has effectively stopped the allocation of this award to that country&#x27;s citizens in preference to other Australian honours. The last Australian member, Doug Anthony, former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, died on 20 December 2020. Companions from other Commonwealth realms continue to be appointed, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, a New Zealand soprano, was given the award in 2018 and Canadian author Margaret Atwood was given the award in 2019.

Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe CH represented the Order at the 2023 Coronation.

==Insignia==
The insignia of the order is in the form of an oval medallion, surmounted by a royal crown (but, until recently, surmounted by an imperial crown), and with a rectangular panel within, depicting on it an oak tree, a shield with the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom hanging from one branch, and, on the left, a mounted knight in armour. The insignia&#x27;s blue border bears in gold letters the motto &quot;IN ACTION FAITHFUL AND IN HONOUR CLEAR&quot;, Alexander Pope&#x27;s description (in iambic pentameter) in his &quot;Epistle to Mr Addison&quot; of James Craggs the Younger, later used on Craggs&#x27;s monument in Westminster Abbey. Men wear the badge on a neck ribbon (red with golden border threads) and women on a bow at the left shoulder.

<text>George Richard Chamberlain (born March 31, 1934) is an American actor and singer who became a teen idol in the title role of the television show &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (1961–1966). He subsequently appeared in several miniseries, such as &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983). Chamberlain has also performed classical stage roles and worked in musical theater.

He played the role of Aramis in the film trilogy &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1989); portrayed Allan Quatermain in both &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1985) and &quot;Lost City of Gold&quot; (1986); and was the first to play Jason Bourne in the 1988 television film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. 

==Early life==
Chamberlain was born 31 March 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, the second son of Elsa Winnifred (née von Benzon; later Matthews) and Charles Axion Chamberlain, who was a salesman. In 1952, Chamberlain graduated from Beverly Hills High School, and later attended Pomona College (class of 1956). Chamberlain was drafted into the United States Army, attaining the rank of sergeant while serving in Korea from 1956 to 1958.

==Career==
Chamberlain co-founded a Los Angeles–based theater group, Company of Angels, and began appearing on television in guest roles in the early 1960s. In 1961, he gained widespread fame as the young intern Dr. James Kildare in the NBC/MGM television series of the same name, co-starring with Raymond Massey. Chamberlain&#x27;s singing ability also led to some hit singles in the early 1960s, including the &quot;Theme from Dr. Kildare&quot;, titled &quot;Three Stars Will Shine Tonight&quot;, which struck No. 10 according to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Charts. &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; ended in 1966, after which Chamberlain began performing on the theater circuit. In 1966, he was cast opposite Mary Tyler Moore in the ill-fated Broadway musical &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, co-starring Priscilla Lopez, which, after an out-of-town tryout period, closed after only four previews. Decades later, he returned to Broadway in revivals of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

At the end of the 1960s, Chamberlain spent a period of time in England, where he played in repertory theater and in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1968), becoming recognized as a serious actor. The following year, he starred opposite Katharine Hepburn in the film &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (1969). While in England, he took vocal coaching and in 1969 performed the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, becoming the first American to play the role there since John Barrymore in 1925. He received excellent notices and reprised the role for television in 1970 for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;. A recording of the presentation was released by RCA Red Seal Records and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

In the 1970s, Chamberlain appeared in &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1970), &quot;Lady Caroline Lamb&quot; (playing Lord Byron; 1973), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and its sequel &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974) playing Aramis, &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Not for Burning&quot; (made for television, 1974), &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), (in a villainous turn as a dishonest engineer), and &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1975). In &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot; (1976), a musical version of the Cinderella story, co-starring Gemma Craven, he displayed his vocal talents. A television film, William Bast&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot; (1977), followed. The same year, he starred in Peter Weir&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Wave&quot; (1977).

Chamberlain later appeared in several popular television mini-series (earning him a nickname of &quot;King of the Mini-Series&quot;), including &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978–79), &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980), and &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983), as Father Ralph de Bricassart with Rachel Ward and Barbara Stanwyck co-starring. In the 1980s, he appeared as leading man, playing Allan Quatermain in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1985) and its sequel &quot;Lost City of Gold&quot; (1986), and played Jason Bourne/David Webb in the television film version of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (1988), and reprised the role of Aramis in the last of the trilogy &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot; (1989).
===Since 1990===
Since the 1990s, Chamberlain has appeared mainly in television films, on stage, and as a guest star on such series as &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. in 1991, he appeared in a TV movie version of Davis Grubb&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; that received mixed reviews. He starred as Henry Higgins in the 1993–1994 Broadway revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. In the fall of 2005, Chamberlain appeared in the title role of Ebenezer Scrooge in the Broadway National Tour of &quot;&quot;. In 2006, Chamberlain guest-starred in an episode of the British drama series &quot;Hustle&quot;, as well as season 4 of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. In 2007, Chamberlain guest-starred as Glen Wingfield, Lynette Scavo&#x27;s stepfather in episode 80 (Season 4, Episode 8, &quot;Distant Past&quot;) of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

In 2008 and 2009, Chamberlain appeared as King Arthur in the national tour of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Spamalot&quot;. In 2010 and 2012, he appeared as Archie Leach in season 3, episode 3 and season 4, episode 18 of the series &quot;Leverage&quot;, as well as two episodes of season 4 of &quot;Chuck&quot; where he played a villain known only as The Belgian. Chamberlain has also appeared in several episodes of &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, playing an old friend and love-interest of Saul&#x27;s. He also appeared in the independent film &quot;We Are the Hartmans&quot; in 2011. In 2012, Chamberlain appeared on stage in the Pasadena Playhouse as Dr. Sloper in the play &quot;The Heiress&quot;.

In 2017, Chamberlain appeared in &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; as Bill Kennedy.

==Personal life==
Chamberlain was not open about his homosexuality for most of his career, to protect his privacy and his acting opportunities. He was outed by the French women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Nous Deux&quot; in December 1989, but did not confirm it until his 2003 autobiography &quot;Shattered Love: A Memoir&quot;.

Chamberlain was involved romantically with actor Wesley Eure in the 1970s.

In 1977, Chamberlain began a long-term relationship with Martin Rabbett, an actor, like Eure, 20 years his junior. Rabbett played the brother of Chamberlain&#x27;s lead character in the 1986 film &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot;. They began living together in Hawaii in 1986 and had a private commitment ceremony. The couple split amicably in 2010, with Chamberlain moving to Los Angeles. In a 2014 interview, Chamberlain said that while he and Rabbett were no longer intimately involved, they remained close friends.

<text>Duke of Bedford (named after Bedford, England) is a title that has been created six times (for five distinct people) in the Peerage of England. The first creation came in 1414 for Henry IV&#x27;s third son, John, who later served as regent of France. In 1433 he surrendered the title and it was re-granted to him. The title became extinct on his death in 1435. The third creation came in 1470 in favour of George Neville, nephew of Warwick the Kingmaker. He was deprived of the title by Act of Parliament in 1478. The fourth creation came in 1478 in favour of George, the third son of Edward IV. He died the following year at the age of two. The fifth creation came in 1485 in favour of Jasper Tudor, half-brother of Henry VI and uncle of Henry VII. He had already been created Earl of Pembroke in 1452. However, as he was a Lancastrian, his title was forfeited between 1461 and 1485 during the predominance of the House of York. He regained the earldom in 1485 when his nephew Henry VII came to the throne and was elevated to the dukedom the same year. He had no legitimate children and the titles became extinct on his death in 1495.

John Russell, a close adviser of Henry VIII and Edward VI, was granted the title of Earl of Bedford in 1551, and his descendant William, 5th Earl, was created Duke in 1694, following the Glorious Revolution. The Russell family currently holds the titles of Earl and Duke of Bedford.

The subsidiary titles of the Duke of Bedford, all in the Peerage of England, are Marquess of Tavistock (created 1694), Earl of Bedford (1550), Baron Russell, of Cheneys (1539), Baron Russell of Thornhaugh in the County of Northampton (1603), and Baron Howland, of Streatham in the County of Surrey (1695). The courtesy title of the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s eldest son and heir is &quot;Marquess of Tavistock&quot;.

Every Duke from the 5th Duke onwards is descended from Charles II of England. The family seat is Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. The private mausoleum and chapel of the Russell Family and the Dukes of Bedford is at St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Chenies, Buckinghamshire (photo). The family owns The Bedford Estate in central London.

<text>Roberta Achtenberg (born July 20, 1950) is an American attorney and civil rights advocate who served as a commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She was previously assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, becoming the first openly lesbian or gay public official in the United States whose appointment to a federal position was confirmed by the United States Senate. This confirmation hearing garnered a lot of publicity, opposition, and support.

Achtenberg went to school at different branches of the University of California and later attended the University of Utah. Before her political career, she worked as an attorney, director, educator, and founded organizations. Achtenberg is married with a son, and has been locally and nationally recognized with many awards and has made many publications throughout her career.

== Personal life ==

=== Early life ===
Achtenberg&#x27;s father was Jewish and immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union, while her mother was from Quebec. Both parents had minimal formal education. They owned a grocery store in Los Angeles and raised Roberta and her three siblings in California.

=== Education ===
After graduating from Morningside High School in Inglewood, California, Achtenberg attended University of California, Los Angeles, and the transferred to the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. At Berkeley, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa. Achtenberg also met her ex-husband, David Chavkin at Berkeley. She began law school at University of California, Hastings College of the Law, before eventually receiving her Juris Doctor from the University of Utah in 1975.

=== Personal life ===
Roberta Achtenberg divorced from David Chavkin in a cordial manner in 1977, and soon after came out to her family as a lesbian. After Achtenberg came out publicly, she received national support and opposition. LGBTQ+ people and allies rallied in her support, and religious and conservative groups lobbied against her.

Achtenberg met her former partner, Mary Morgan, judge on the San Francisco Municipal Court, in 1979, and became partners in 1982. In 1985, Achtenberg and Morgan had a child named Benjamin. Achtenberg and Morgan were one of the most visible lesbian couples with a child at the time of Achtenberg&#x27;s political career. During a San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Pride Parade, Achtenberg and Mary Morgan hugged and kissed while riding a float with their son, which generated controversy during her entrance to her federal political career. In 1995, Achtenberg gave a speech at the San Francisco Dyke March and Gay Pride March.

In 2015, she spoke at the University of Utah&#x27;s S.J Quinney College of Law&#x27;s Commencement ceremony.

== Career ==
Before becoming a public official, Achtenberg worked for more than 15 years as a civil rights attorney, public interest advocate, nonprofit director, and legal educator.

Between 1975 and 1976, she served as a teaching fellow at Stanford University Law School. In 1976, Achtenberg became the Dean of the New College of California School of Law. Achtenberg supported the LGBTQ community early in her political career. Her activity included co-founding the National Center for Lesbian Rights in 1977, along with Donna Hitchens. The center works for LGBTQ+ individuals, and provides them with legal services and counsel, advocacy, and education services.

Additionally, in 1978 Achtenberg represented LGBTQ rights while in the Anti-Sexism Committee for the National Lawyers Guild. While working for the organization, she edited &quot;Sexual Orientation and the Law&quot; (1985). One issue this project highlighted was making a guide for how to give lesbian and gay people appropriate representation. The paper outlines how to properly represent LGBTQ+ juveniles, how to tackle First Amendment issues regarding LGBTQ+ people or speech, and more.

Achtenberg has formerly worked at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco on the Board of Directors from 1997 to 2002 where she chaired the Affordable Housing Committee, and worked as a Staff Attorney for the Lesbian Rights Project of Equal Rights Advocates. In 2000, she became the Director of Andrew J. Wong, Inc, and has worked there since. In 2018 she was named to the Policy Transition team of Mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, to help address a variety of issues including LBGTQ policies.

She is the founder and a partner at ABK City Advisors, also serves as a Senior Advisor at Lennar Corporation, and is the Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of the Bank of San Francisco.

== Political career ==
Achtenberg unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the 1988 California State Assembly special election to replace Art Agnos, losing to John Burton. She was elected as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1990, in the first time that two lesbians (alongside Carole Migden) won seats to the board. In her tenure on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, she worked on issues from individuals&#x27; rights to small businesses to making domestic violence shelters. While still serving on the Board of Supervisors in 1992, Achtenberg was appointed to the committee drafting the National Democratic Party&#x27;s platform.

In 1993, she was appointed Assistant Secretary for the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity by President Bill Clinton, becoming the first &#x27;out,&#x27; LGBTQ person to be appointed and confirmed to a position within a cabinet office. In her role as Assistant Secretary, Achtenberg successfully integrated a previously all-white town in Vidor, Texas. There was Ku Klux Klan opposition to this public housing integration. She additionally worked to help find housing for displaced families due to a hurricane in 1994, and worked on improving fairness in the housing systems. Her group was also awarded Vice President Gore&#x27;s Hammer Award. From 1995 to 1997, she was appointed as the senior advisor to the Secretary of United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Achtenberg left the post in 1995 to run for mayor of San Francisco, and placed third behind Frank Jordan and Willie Brown (who would win in the runoff). From 1998 to 2004, Achtenberg helped develop the policies for both the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the San Francisco Center for Economic Development. She served as Senior Vice President for Public Policy at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce until January 2005. In 2004 during her time as the Senior Vice President, she helped a same-sex couple, Phyllis Ann Lyon and Del Martin, obtain the first marriage license issued for a same-sex couple by San Francisco.

In 2000, she was appointed to the Board of Trustees of California State University by Governor Gray Davis, becoming chair of the board in May 2006, serving on the CSU Board of Trustees until 2015. Achtenberg served 16 years on the California State University Board of Trustees, serving two years as chair, where she developed the Access to Excellence Plan. Achtenberg also was crucial in the formation of the CSU Institute for Palliative Care, and was a member of the Palliative Care&#x27;s National Advisory Board. Because of her extensive work with California State University, she was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters.

Achtenberg was in charge of the Housing and Urban Development Department&#x27;s Agency Review Team that assisted the Obama administration during its transition to office in 2008. On January 26, 2011, President Barack Obama named Achtenberg as a Commissioner for the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She served until 2016.

=== Assistant Secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Nomination and Confirmation Hearing ===
Roberta Achtenberg was nominated, by President Bill Clinton, to be the Assistant Secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Her confirmation was announced during the lift of the ban on letting gay people in the military. Her confirmation hearing was held in front of the Senate&#x27;s Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and started on April 29, 1993.

After debates lasting three days, including nine and a half hours of filibusters on May 19 and 20, Achtenberg was confirmed by the 103th Senate on May 24, 1993, securing a vote of 58 YEAs to 31 NAYs, with 1 voting as present and 10 not voting. Roberta Achtenberg was the first openly LGBTQ+ individual to go through the senate confirmation process, and the subsequently was the first LGBTQ+ individual to hold a federal position.

During the hearing, Achtenberg was questioned by many Senators, including Senators Faircloth, Boxer, and Bond. Throughout the process, she was loudly opposed by Senator Jesse Helms, who called her &quot;a damn lesbian&quot; that the Senate should refuse to confirm to the position. Achtenberg also received opposition from the Christian Action Network, due to her radical lesbian activism. Achtenberg received endorsements from many organizations and people, such as the National Fair Housing Alliance, San Francisco Bar Association, the National Association of Human Rights Workers, Senator Feinstein, and Congresswoman Pelosi.

She also expressed her own viewpoints and goals related to the position. Achtenberg stated that in the role of Assistant Secretary, she would strive to eradicate housing discrimination and allow people to make free and fair choices surrounding their housing.

<doc id="320727" wikidata="Q3973204" url="?curid=320727" title="Stephen Milligan">
<text>Stephen David Wyatt Milligan (12 May 1948 – 7 February 1994) was a British Conservative politician and journalist. He held a number of senior journalistic posts until his election to serve as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastleigh in 1992. Milligan was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jonathan Aitken, Minister of State for Defence, and was regarded as a &quot;rising star&quot; of the Conservative Party. He remained in office until he died at his home in Hammersmith, London, apparently self-strangled during an act of autoerotic asphyxiation.

==Early life==
Milligan was born in Godalming, Surrey, on 12 May 1948, the son of David Milligan, a company secretary at House of Fraser, and Ruth Seymour, a ballet teacher. He was educated at Bradfield College, and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics. At Oxford, he became president of both the Oxford Union and the Oxford University Conservative Association. He was a contemporary of journalist Libby Purves, whom he once partnered to a College Ball.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Milligan joined &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1970, and was industrial editor and chief EEC correspondent from 1972 to 1980. In 1976, he published a book, &quot;The New Barons&quot;, on British trade unions in the 1970s. Still working for &quot;The Economist&quot;, he took a position as presenter of &quot;The World Tonight&quot; on BBC Radio 4 from 1980 until 1983. He later became foreign editor and Washington correspondent at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 1984 until 1987, before rejoining the BBC in 1988 as a European correspondent. &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor Andrew Neil described Milligan: &quot;He possessed an enquiring, original intelligence, a wide knowledge of foreign and domestic affairs and he was great fun to work with, his infectious laugh filling our editorial meetings, where he played a major role in defining the paper&#x27;s policy positions&quot;.

===Politics===
Milligan left the Conservative Party upon the formation of the Social Democratic Party in 1981. However, he rejoined the Conservatives and in 1990 was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Eastleigh. He became secretary of the Conservative Foreign and Commonwealth Council in 1991 and was a member of the moderate Bow Group. At the 1992 general election, Milligan was elected as Member of Parliament for Eastleigh with a majority of 17,702. Seen as a &#x27;rising star&#x27; in the party and noted for his Commons interventions on foreign policy, he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jonathan Aitken, Minister of State for Defence. His last contribution in Parliament was in a debate on the Energy Conservation Bill on 4 February 1994.

==Death==

Milligan was found dead in his house at 64 Black Lion Lane, Hammersmith, London, by his secretary Vera Taggart on 7 February 1994. Milligan had failed to appear in the House of Commons as expected, and so Taggart went to look for him. Milligan&#x27;s corpse was found naked except for a pair of stockings and suspenders, with an electrical flex tied around his neck, his head covered and an orange in his mouth. The coroner concluded that he had died in the early hours of February 7th (on the same day). 

The pathology report into Milligan&#x27;s death discounted the possibility of murder, lending weight to the belief that he died as a result of suicide or, more likely, died accidentally from autoerotic asphyxiation. No drugs or alcohol were found in his blood, and no substances were found to have contributed to his death. It was ruled a death by misadventure.

===Aftermath===
Milligan&#x27;s death was one of the scandals which contributed to the collapse of John Major&#x27;s &quot;Back to Basics&quot; policy initiative, which was seen as emphasising socially conservative values. In an interview after Milligan&#x27;s death, likely under the presumption it was a suicide, Major said that Milligan &quot;must have been pretty unhappy, pretty miserable&quot;. This characterisation was criticised by Milligan&#x27;s cousin, Judge Tim Milligan, who wrote that &quot;with respect to the Prime Minister, Stephen was neither miserable or unhappy. On the contrary, he was thoroughly fulfilled and happy in his work in Westminster and his Eastleigh constituency, which gave him the chance to be of service to others as he always wished.&quot;

Milligan left an estate worth , leaving to Oxfam and to St Peter&#x27;s Church, Hammersmith. His death triggered a by-election for his Eastleigh seat, which was held on 9 June. The by-election was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate David Chidgey, who would hold the seat until the 2005 general election. The Conservative candidate, Stephen Allison, came third in the by-election.

Following Milligan&#x27;s death, Hat Trick Productions, the producers of the BBC&#x27;s satirical television programme &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, sent black bin bags, oranges and black stockings to journalists to publicise a new series of the show. The BBC subsequently apologised to Milligan&#x27;s parents for the incident.

<doc id="320733" wikidata="Q1761108" url="?curid=320733" title="Impedance matching">
<text>In electrical engineering, impedance matching is the practice of designing or adjusting the input impedance or output impedance of an electrical device for a desired value. Often, the desired value is selected to maximize power transfer or minimize signal reflection. For example, impedance matching typically is used to improve power transfer from a radio transmitter via the interconnecting transmission line to the antenna. Signals on a transmission line will be transmitted without reflections if the transmission line is terminated with a matching impedance. 

Techniques of impedance matching include transformers, adjustable networks of lumped resistance, capacitance and inductance, or properly proportioned transmission lines. Practical impedance-matching devices will generally provide best results over a specified frequency band. 

The concept of impedance matching is widespread in electrical engineering, but is relevant in other applications in which a form of energy, not necessarily electrical, is transferred between a source and a load, such as in acoustics or optics. 

== Theory ==
Impedance is the opposition by a system to the flow of energy from a source. For constant signals, this impedance can also be constant. For varying signals, it usually changes with frequency. The energy involved can be electrical, mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, electromagnetic, or thermal. The concept of electrical impedance is perhaps the most commonly known. Electrical impedance, like electrical resistance, is measured in ohms. In general, impedance (symbol: &quot;Z&quot;) has a complex value; this means that loads generally have a resistance component (symbol: &quot;R&quot;) which forms the real part and a reactance component (symbol: &quot;X&quot;) which forms the imaginary part.

In simple cases (such as low-frequency or direct current power transmission) the reactance may be negligible or zero; the impedance can be considered a pure resistance, expressed as a real number. In the following summary we will consider the general case when resistance and reactance are both significant, and the special case in which the reactance is negligible.

===Maximum power transfer matching===
Complex conjugate matching is used when maximum power transfer is required, namely

: formula_1

where a superscript * indicates the complex conjugate. A conjugate match is different from a reflection-less match when either the source or load has a reactive component.

If the source has a reactive component, but the load is purely resistive, then matching can be achieved by adding a reactance of the same magnitude but opposite sign to the load. This simple matching network, consisting of a single element, will usually achieve a perfect match at only a single frequency. This is because the added element will either be a capacitor or an inductor, whose impedance in both cases is frequency dependent, and will not, in general, follow the frequency dependence of the source impedance. For wide bandwidth applications, a more complex network must be designed.

== Power transfer ==

Whenever a source of power &quot;with a fixed output impedance&quot; such as an electric signal source, a radio transmitter or a mechanical sound (e.g., a loudspeaker) operates into a load, the maximum possible power is delivered to the load when the impedance of the load (load impedance or input impedance) is equal to the &quot;complex conjugate&quot; of the impedance of the source (that is, its internal impedance or output impedance). For two impedances to be complex conjugates their resistances must be equal, and their reactances must be equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. In low-frequency or DC systems (or systems with purely resistive sources and loads) the reactances are zero, or small enough to be ignored. In this case, maximum power transfer occurs when the resistance of the load is equal to the resistance of the source (see maximum power theorem for a mathematical proof).

Impedance matching is not always necessary. For example, if delivering a high voltage (to reduce signal degradation or to reduce power consumption) is more important than maximizing power transfer, then &quot;impedance bridging&quot; or &quot;voltage bridging&quot; is often used.

In older audio systems (reliant on transformers and passive filter networks, and based on the telephone system), the source and load resistances were matched at 600 ohms. One reason for this was to maximize power transfer, as there were no amplifiers available that could restore lost signal. Another reason was to ensure correct operation of the hybrid transformers used at central exchange equipment to separate outgoing from incoming speech, so these could be amplified or fed to a four-wire circuit. Most modern audio circuits, on the other hand, use active amplification and filtering and can use voltage-bridging connections for greatest accuracy. Strictly speaking, impedance matching only applies when both source and load devices are linear; however, matching may be obtained between nonlinear devices within certain operating ranges.

==Impedance-matching devices==
Adjusting the source impedance or the load impedance, in general, is called &quot;impedance matching&quot;. There are three ways to improve an impedance mismatch, all of which are called &quot;impedance matching&quot;:
* Devices intended to present an apparent load to the source of &quot;Z&quot;load = &quot;Z&quot;source* (complex conjugate matching). Given a source with a fixed voltage and fixed source impedance, the maximum power theorem says this is the only way to extract the maximum power from the source.
* Devices intended to present an apparent load of &quot;Z&quot;load = &quot;Z&quot;line (complex impedance matching), to avoid echoes. Given a transmission line source with a fixed source impedance, this &quot;reflectionless impedance matching&quot; at the end of the transmission line is the only way to avoid reflecting echoes back to the transmission line.
* Devices intended to present an apparent source resistance as close to zero as possible, or presenting an apparent source voltage as high as possible. This is the only way to maximize energy efficiency, and so it is used at the beginning of electrical power lines. Such an impedance bridging connection also minimizes distortion and electromagnetic interference; it is also used in modern audio amplifiers and signal-processing devices.

There are a variety of devices used between a source of energy and a load that perform &quot;impedance matching&quot;. To match electrical impedances, engineers use combinations of transformers, resistors, inductors, capacitors and transmission lines. These passive (and active) impedance-matching devices are optimized for different applications and include baluns, antenna tuners (sometimes called ATUs or roller-coasters, because of their appearance), acoustic horns, matching networks, and terminators.

===Transformers===
Transformers are sometimes used to match the impedances of circuits. A transformer converts alternating current at one voltage to the same waveform at another voltage. The power input to the transformer and output from the transformer is the same (except for conversion losses). The side with the lower voltage is at low impedance (because this has the lower number of turns), and the side with the higher voltage is at a higher impedance (as it has more turns in its coil).

One example of this method involves a television balun transformer. This transformer allows interfacing a balanced line (300-ohm twin-lead) and an unbalanced line (75-ohm coaxial cable such as RG-6). To match the impedances, both cables must be connected to a matching transformer with a turns ratio of 2:1. In this example, the 300-ohm line is connected to the transformer side with more turns; the 75-ohm cable is connected to the transformer side with fewer turns. The formula for calculating the transformer turns ratio for this example is:
: formula_2

===Resistive network===
Resistive impedance matches are easiest to design and can be achieved with a simple L pad consisting of two resistors. Power loss is an unavoidable consequence of using resistive networks, and they are only (usually) used to transfer line level signals.

===Stepped transmission line===
Most lumped-element devices can match a specific range of load impedances. For example, in order to match an inductive load into a real impedance, a capacitor needs to be used. If the load impedance becomes capacitive, the matching element must be replaced by an inductor. In many cases, there is a need to use the same circuit to match a broad range of load impedance and thus simplify the circuit design. This issue was addressed by the stepped transmission line, where multiple, serially placed, quarter-wave dielectric slugs are used to vary a transmission line&#x27;s characteristic impedance. By controlling the position of each element, a broad range of load impedances can be matched without having to reconnect the circuit.

===Filters===
Filters are frequently used to achieve impedance matching in telecommunications and radio engineering. In general, it is not theoretically possible to achieve perfect impedance matching at all frequencies with a network of discrete components. Impedance matching networks are designed with a definite bandwidth, take the form of a filter, and use filter theory in their design.

Applications requiring only a narrow bandwidth, such as radio tuners and transmitters, might use a simple tuned filter such as a stub. This would provide a perfect match at one specific frequency only. Wide bandwidth matching requires filters with multiple sections.

====L-section====
A simple electrical impedance-matching network requires one capacitor and one inductor. In the figure to the right, R1 &gt; R2, however, either R1 or R2 may be the source and the other the load. One of X1 or X2 must be an inductor and the other must be a capacitor. One reactance is in parallel with the source (or load), and the other is in series with the load (or source). If a reactance is in parallel &quot;with the source&quot;, the effective network matches from high to low impedance. 

The analysis is as follows. Consider a real source impedance of formula_3 and real load impedance of formula_4. If a reactance formula_5 is in parallel with the source impedance, the combined impedance can be written as:
: formula_6
If the imaginary part of the above impedance is canceled by the series reactance, the real part is
: formula_7
Solving for formula_5
: formula_9. 
: formula_10.
:where formula_11.

Note, formula_5, the reactance in parallel, has a negative reactance because it is typically a capacitor. This gives the L-network the additional feature of harmonic suppression since it is a low pass filter too.

The inverse connection (impedance step-up) is simply the reverse—for example, reactance in series with the source. The magnitude of the impedance ratio is limited by reactance losses such as the Q of the inductor. Multiple L-sections can be wired in cascade to achieve higher impedance ratios or greater bandwidth. Transmission line matching networks can be modeled as infinitely many L-sections wired in cascade. Optimal matching circuits can be designed for a particular system using Smith charts.

==Power factor correction==
Power factor correction devices are intended to cancel the reactive and nonlinear characteristics of a load at the end of a power line. This causes the load seen by the power line to be purely resistive. For a given true power required by a load this minimizes the true current supplied through the power lines, and minimizes power wasted in the resistance of those power lines. For example, a maximum power point tracker is used to extract the maximum power from a solar panel and efficiently transfer it to batteries, the power grid or other loads.
The maximum power theorem applies to its &quot;upstream&quot; connection to the solar panel, so it emulates a load resistance equal to the solar panel source resistance. However, the maximum power theorem does not apply to its &quot;downstream&quot; connection. That connection is an impedance bridging connection; it emulates a high-voltage, low-resistance source to maximize efficiency.

On the power grid the overall load is usually inductive. Consequently, power factor correction is most commonly achieved with banks of capacitors. It is only necessary for correction to be achieved at one single frequency, the frequency of the supply. Complex networks are only required when a band of frequencies must be matched and this is the reason why simple capacitors are all that is usually required for power factor correction.

== Transmission lines ==

In RF connections, impedance matching is desirable, because otherwise reflections may be created at the end of the mismatched transmission line. The reflection may cause frequency-dependent loss.

In electrical systems involving transmission lines (such as radio and fiber optics)—where the length of the line is long compared to the wavelength of the signal (the signal changes rapidly compared to the time it takes to travel from source to load)— the impedances at each end of the line may be matched to the transmission line&#x27;s characteristic impedance (formula_13) to prevent reflections of the signal at the ends of the line. In radio-frequency (RF) systems, a common value for source and load impedances is 50 ohms. A typical RF load is a quarter-wave ground plane antenna (37 ohms with an ideal ground plane).

The general form of the voltage reflection coefficient for a wave moving from medium 1 to medium 2 is given by

:formula_14

while the voltage reflection coefficient for a wave moving from medium 2 to medium 1 is

:formula_15

:formula_16

so the reflection coefficient is the same (except for sign), no matter from which direction the wave approaches the boundary.

There is also a current reflection coefficient, which is the negative of the voltage reflection coefficient. If the wave encounters an open at the load end, positive voltage and negative current pulses are transmitted back toward the source (negative current means the current is going the opposite direction). Thus, at each boundary there are four reflection coefficients (voltage and current on one side, and voltage and current on the other side). All four are the same, except that two are positive and two are negative. The voltage reflection coefficient and current reflection coefficient on the same side have opposite signs. Voltage reflection coefficients on opposite sides of the boundary have opposite signs.

Because they are all the same except for sign it is traditional to interpret the reflection coefficient as the voltage reflection coefficient (unless otherwise indicated). Either end (or both ends) of a transmission line can be a source or a load (or both), so there is no inherent preference for which side of the boundary is medium 1 and which side is medium 2. With a single transmission line it is customary to define the voltage reflection coefficient for a wave incident on the boundary from the transmission line side, regardless of whether a source or load is connected on the other side.

===Single-source transmission line driving a load===

====Load-end conditions====

In a transmission line, a wave travels from the source along the line. Suppose the wave hits a boundary (an abrupt change in impedance). Some of the wave is reflected back, while some keeps moving onwards. (Assume there is only one boundary, at the load.)

Let
:formula_17 and formula_18 be the voltage and current that is incident on the boundary from the source side.
:formula_19 and formula_20 be the voltage and current that is transmitted to the load.
:formula_21 and formula_22 be the voltage and current that is reflected back toward the source.

On the line side of the boundary formula_23 and formula_24 and on the load side formula_25 where formula_26, formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31 are phasors.

At a boundary, voltage and current must be continuous, therefore
:formula_32
:formula_33

All these conditions are satisfied by

:formula_34
:formula_35
:formula_36
:formula_37

where formula_38 is the reflection coefficient going from the transmission line to the load.

:formula_39

====Source-end conditions====
At the source end of the transmission line, there may be waves incident both from the source and from the line; a reflection coefficient for each direction may be computed with 
:formula_40,
where &quot;Zs&quot; is the source impedance. The source of waves incident from the line are the reflections from the load end. If the source impedance matches the line, reflections from the load end will be absorbed at the source end. If the transmission line is not matched at both ends reflections from the load will be re-reflected at the source and re-re-reflected at the load end &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, losing energy on each transit of the transmission line. This can cause a resonance condition and strongly frequency-dependent behavior. In a narrow-band system this can be desirable for matching, but is generally undesirable in a wide-band system.

=====Source-end impedance=====

:formula_41 

where formula_42 is the one-way transfer function (from either end to the other) when the transmission line is exactly matched at source and load. formula_43 accounts for everything that happens to the signal in transit (including delay, attenuation and dispersion). If there is a perfect match at the load, formula_44 and formula_45

=====Transfer function=====

:formula_46

where formula_47 is the open circuit (or unloaded) output voltage from the source.

Note that if there is a perfect match at both ends 
:formula_44 and formula_49 
and then 
:formula_50.

== Electrical examples ==

===Telephone systems===
Telephone systems also use matched impedances to minimise echo on long-distance lines. This is related to transmission-line theory. Matching also enables the telephone &quot;hybrid coil&quot; (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances. In the local loop, the impedance chosen is 600 ohms (nominal). Terminating networks are installed at the exchange to offer the best match to their subscriber lines. Each country has its own standard for these networks, but they are all designed to approximate about 600 ohms over the voice frequency band.

===Loudspeaker amplifiers===
Audio amplifiers typically do not match impedances, but provide an output impedance that is lower than the load impedance (such as &lt; 0.1 ohm in typical semiconductor amplifiers), for improved speaker damping. For vacuum tube amplifiers, impedance-changing transformers are often used to get a low output impedance, and to better match the amplifier&#x27;s performance to the load impedance. Some tube amplifiers have output transformer taps to adapt the amplifier output to typical loudspeaker impedances.

The output transformer in vacuum-tube-based amplifiers has two basic functions:

*Separation of the AC component (which contains the audio signals) from the DC component (supplied by the power supply) in the anode circuit of a vacuum-tube-based power stage. A loudspeaker should not be subjected to DC current.
*Reducing the output impedance of power pentodes (such as the EL34) in a common-cathode configuration.

The impedance of the loudspeaker on the secondary coil of the transformer will be transformed to a higher impedance on the primary coil in the circuit of the power pentodes by the square of the turns ratio, which forms the &quot;impedance scaling factor&quot;.

The output stage in common-drain or common-collector semiconductor-based end stages with MOSFETs or power transistors has a very low output impedance. If they are properly balanced, there is no need for a transformer or a large electrolytic capacitor to separate AC from DC current.

== Non-electrical examples ==

===Acoustics===
Similar to electrical transmission lines, an impedance matching problem exists when transferring sound energy from one medium to another. If the acoustic impedance of the two media are very different most sound energy will be reflected (or absorbed), rather than transferred across the border. The gel used in medical ultrasonography helps transfer acoustic energy from the transducer to the body and back again. Without the gel, the impedance mismatch in the transducer-to-air and the air-to-body discontinuity reflects almost all the energy, leaving very little to go into the body.

The bones in the middle ear function as a series of levers, which matches mechanical impedance between the eardrum (which is acted upon by vibrations in air) and the fluid-filled inner ear.
Horns in loudspeaker systems are used like transformers in electrical circuits to match the impedance of the transducer to the impedance of the air. This principle is used in both horn loudspeakers and musical instruments. Because most driver impedances are poorly matched to the impedance of free air at low frequencies, loudspeaker enclosures are designed to both match impedance and minimize destructive phase cancellations between output from the front and rear of a speaker cone. The loudness of sound produced in air from a loudspeaker is directly related to the ratio of the diameter of the speaker to the wavelength of the sound being produced: larger speakers can produce lower frequencies at a higher level than smaller speakers. Elliptical speakers are a complex case, acting like large speakers lengthwise and small speakers crosswise. Acoustic impedance matching (or the lack of it) affects the operation of a megaphone, an echo and soundproofing.

===Optics===
A similar effect occurs when light (or any electromagnetic wave) hits the interface between two media with different refractive indices. For non-magnetic materials, the refractive index is inversely proportional to the material&#x27;s characteristic impedance. An &quot;optical&quot; or &quot;wave impedance&quot; (that depends on the propagation direction) can be calculated for each medium, and may be used in the transmission-line reflection equation

:formula_51

to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients for the interface. For non-magnetic dielectrics, this equation is equivalent to the Fresnel equations. Unwanted reflections can be reduced by the use of an anti-reflection optical coating.

===Mechanics===
If a body of mass &quot;m&quot; collides elastically with a second body, maximum energy transfer to the second body will occur when the second body has the same mass &quot;m&quot;. In a head-on collision of equal masses, the energy of the first body will be completely transferred to the second body (as in Newton&#x27;s cradle for example). In this case, the masses act as &quot;mechanical impedances&quot;, which must be matched to maximize energy transfer.

If formula_52 and formula_53 are the masses of the moving and stationary bodies, and &quot;P&quot; is the momentum of the system (which remains constant throughout the collision), the energy of the second body after the collision will be &quot;E&quot;2:

:formula_54

which is analogous to the power-transfer equation.

If we cannot change the masses of bodies, then we can match their impedance with a lever. Imagine a large ball dropping to the ground, and a small ball lying on the ground. The large ball hits the short end of a lever, and the small ball is launched from the long end of the lever. If the lever arm lengths satisfy formula_55, then all energy would be transferred to the small ball if collisions are elastic. This is roughly how the middle ear works (see above).

These principles are useful in the application of highly energetic materials (explosives). If an explosive charge is placed on a target, the sudden release of energy causes compression waves to propagate through the target radially from the point-charge contact. When the compression waves reach areas of high acoustic impedance mismatch (such as the opposite side of the target), tension waves reflect back and create spalling. The greater the mismatch, the greater the effect of creasing and spalling will be. A charge initiated against a wall with air behind it will do more damage to the wall than a charge initiated against a wall with soil behind it.

<text>Rupert James Hector Everett (; born 29 May 1959) is a British actor. He first came to public attention in 1981 when he was cast in Julian Mitchell&#x27;s play and subsequent film &quot;Another Country&quot; (1984) as a gay pupil at an English public school in the 1930s; the role earned him his first BAFTA Award nomination. He received a second BAFTA nomination and his first Golden Globe Award nomination for his role in &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), followed by a second Golden Globe nomination for &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1999). He voiced Prince Charming in the animated films &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007). He also played John Lamont/Mr. Barron in &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot; (2016).

==Early life and education==
Rupert James Hector Everett was born on 29 May 1959, to wealthy parents. His father was in the British Army, Major Anthony Michael Everett. His maternal grandfather, Vice Admiral Sir Hector Charles Donald MacLean DSO, was a nephew of Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, Hector Lachlan Stewart MacLean. His maternal grandmother, Opre Vyvyan, was a descendant of the baronets Vyvyan of Trelowarren and the German (Baron) von Schmiedern. Everett is of English, Irish, Scottish, and more distant German and Dutch ancestry. He was raised a Roman Catholic.

From age seven, Everett was educated at Farleigh School in Andover, Hampshire, and later educated by Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College, Yorkshire. When he was 16, his parents agreed that he could leave school and move to London to train as an actor at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. In an interview with &quot;US&quot; magazine in 1997, he said that he supported himself during this period by doing sex work for drugs and money.

==Career==

===1980s===
Everett&#x27;s break came in 1981 at the Greenwich Theatre and later West End production of &quot;Another Country&quot;, playing a gay schoolboy opposite Kenneth Branagh.

His first film was the Academy Award-winning short &quot;A Shocking Accident&quot; (1982), directed by James Scott and based on a Graham Greene story. This was followed by a film version of &quot;Another Country&quot; in 1984 with Cary Elwes and Colin Firth. Following on with &quot;Dance With a Stranger&quot; (1985), Everett began to develop a promising film career until he co-starred with Bob Dylan in the unsuccessful &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot; (1987). Around the same time, Everett recorded and released an album of pop songs entitled &quot;Generation of Loneliness&quot;.

Despite being managed by Simon Napier-Bell (who had steered Wham! to prominence), the public didn&#x27;t take to his change in direction. The shift was short-lived, and he only returned to pop indirectly by providing backing vocals for Madonna many years later, on her cover of &quot;American Pie&quot; and on the track &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; on Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;Swing When You&#x27;re Winning&quot; in 2001.

===1990s===

In 1989, Everett moved to Paris, writing a novel, &quot;Hello, Darling, Are You Working?&quot;, and coming out as gay, a disclosure which he has said may well have damaged his career. Returning to the public eye in &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1990), several films of variable success followed. The Italian comics character Dylan Dog, created by Tiziano Sclavi in 1986, is graphically inspired by him. Everett, in turn, appeared in &quot;Cemetery Man&quot; (1994), an adaptation of Sclavi&#x27;s novel &quot;Dellamorte Dellamore&quot;. In 1995 Everett published a second novel, &quot;The Hairdressers of St. Tropez&quot;.

His career was revitalised by his award-winning performance in &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), playing Julia Roberts&#x27;s character&#x27;s gay friend, followed by a role as Madonna&#x27;s character&#x27;s gay best friend in &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot; (2000). (Everett was a backup vocalist on her cover of &quot;American Pie&quot;, which is on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.) Around the same time, he starred as the sadistic Sanford Scolex/Dr. Claw in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; (also 1999) with Matthew Broderick.

===2000s===

For the 21st century, Everett decided to write again. He has been a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; contributing editor, written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and he wrote a film screenplay on playwright Oscar Wilde&#x27;s final years, for which he sought funding.

In 2006, Everett published a memoir, &quot;Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins&quot;, in which he reveals his six-year affair with British television presenter Paula Yates. Although he is sometimes described as bisexual, as opposed to gay, during a radio show with Jonathan Ross, he described his heterosexual affairs as the result of adventurousness: &quot;I was basically adventurous, I think I wanted to try everything&quot;.
Since the revelation of his sexuality, Everett has participated in public activities (leading the 2007 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras), played a double role in the film &quot;St. Trinian&#x27;s&quot;, and has appeared on TV several times (as a contestant in the special &quot;Comic Relief Does The Apprentice&quot;; as a presenter for Live Earth; and as a guest host on the Channel 4 show &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, among others). He has also garnered media attention for his vitriolic quips and forthright opinions during interviews that have caused public outrage.

In May 2007, he delivered one of the eulogies at the funeral of fashion director Isabella Blow, his friend since they were teenagers, who had died by suicide. He asked as part of his speech: &quot;Have you gotten what you wanted, Issie? Life was a relationship that you rejected.&quot; During this time he also voiced the nefarious, but handsome villain Prince Charming in the first two &quot;Shrek&quot; sequels.

Everett&#x27;s documentary entitled &quot;The Victorian Sex Explorer&quot; on Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821–1890) in which he retraces the travels of Burton through countries such as India and Egypt, aired on the BBC in 2008. In 2009, Everett suggested, in an interview with the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;, that coming out was not the best career move for a young actor.

Also in 2009, Everett presented two Channel 4 documentaries: one on the travels of Lord Byron, the Romantic poet, broadcast in July 2009, and another on British explorer Sir Richard Burton.

Everett then returned to his acting roots, appearing in several theatre productions: his Broadway debut in 2009 at the Shubert Theatre received positive critical reviews; he performed in a Noël Coward play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, starring alongside Angela Lansbury, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson, under the direction of Michael Blakemore. and he was expected to tour several Italian cities during the 2008–09 winter season in another Coward play &quot;Private Lives&quot; (performed in Italian, which he speaks fluently)—playing Elyot to Italian actress Asia Argento&#x27;s Amanda—but the production was cancelled.

===2010s===

During the summer of 2010, Everett performed as Professor Henry Higgins, with English actress Honeysuckle Weeks and Stephanie Cole, in a revival of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre. He reprised the role in May 2011 at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, starring alongside Diana Rigg and Kara Tointon.

In July 2010, Everett was featured in the family history programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; Released in late 2010, the comedy film &quot;Wild Target&quot; features Everett as an art-loving gangster, and also starred Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt.

In 2012, Everett starred in the television adaptation of &quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; with Benedict Cumberbatch. The five-part drama was adapted by Sir Tom Stoppard from the novels of Ford Madox Ford, and Everett appears as the brother of protagonist Christopher Tietjens.

Everett then starred as Oscar Wilde in &quot;The Judas Kiss&quot;, a stage play which was revived at London&#x27;s Hampstead Theatre beginning 6 September 2012, co-starring Freddie Fox as Bosie, and directed by Neil Armfield. It ran at the Hampstead through 13 October 2012, toured the UK and Dublin, then transferred to the West End at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre on 9 January 2013, in a limited run through 6 April 2013.

Everett won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Actor in a Play, and was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best Actor. In 2016 the production, still starring Everett and with Charlie Rowe as Bosie, ran in North America for seven weeks in Toronto and five weeks at BAM in New York City.

In early 2013, Everett began working on a film portraying the final period of Wilde&#x27;s life, stating in the media that he has had a fascination with the playwright since he was a child, as his mother read him Wilde&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; before he slept. The subsequent film &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, written and directed by Everett, was released in 2018.

In 2015, it was announced that he would play the part of Philippe Achille, Marquis de Feron, the corrupt Governor of Paris, Head of the Red Guard and illegitimate brother to Louis XIII in the third series of the BBC One drama &quot;The Musketeers&quot;.

In 2017, Everett appeared as a recurring character in the BBC 2 comedy &quot;Quacks&quot;. He plays Dr Hendricks, the neurotic principal of the medical school.

==Personal life==
Between 2006 and 2010, Everett lived in New York City, but returned to London because of his father&#x27;s poor health. In 2008, he bought a home in the Central London district of Belgravia.

In the 1990s, Everett had a six-year-long affair with television presenter and writer Paula Yates, who was married to Bob Geldof at the time.

, Everett lives with his partner Henrique, a Brazilian accountant. They married in 2024.

===Political views===
Everett was a patron of the British Monarchist Society and Foundation.

In 2006, as a homeowner in the central London area of Bloomsbury, he supported a campaign to prevent the establishment of a local Starbucks branch and referred to the global chain as a &quot;cancer&quot;. He protested with 1,000 other residents, and the group compiled a petition.

In 2013, Everett worked on the production of a documentary on sex work for Channel 4 that included the issue of criminalisation. During and after its filming, he contributed to the discourse on prostitution legislation in the UK. In October 2013, he signed an open letter from the English Collective of Prostitutes and Queer Strike—alongside groups such as the Association of Trade Union Councils, Sex Worker Open University, Left Front Art – Radical Progressive Queers, Queer Resistance, and Queers Against the Cuts—to oppose the adoption of the &quot;Swedish model&quot;, whereby the clients of sex workers (though not the workers themselves) are criminalised.

Everett continued his participation in the sex-work legislation debate in 2014, writing a long-form piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and appearing on the BBC One programme &quot;This Week&quot;. He also joined protesters in a demonstration outside the offices of Soho Estates, a major property company that owns properties on Soho&#x27;s Walkers Court, where many sex workers are based.

In 2012, Everett said in an interview regarding same-sex marriage: &quot;But why do we want to get married in churches? I don&#x27;t understand that, myself, personally. I &quot;loathe&quot; heterosexual weddings; I would never go to a wedding in my life. I loathe the flowers, I loathe the fucking wedding dress, the little bridal tiara. It&#x27;s grotesque. It&#x27;s just hideous. The wedding cake, the party, the champagne, the inevitable divorce two years later. It&#x27;s just a waste of time in the heterosexual world, and in the homosexual world I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster.&quot; A few days after the release of the interview, he was criticized for the following remark: &quot;I can&#x27;t think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads&quot;. He went on to explain that &quot;[f]or me, being gay was about wanting to do the opposite of the straight world, so I think that&#x27;s where my problems in this particular area come from. [...] But that&#x27;s me, just me. I&#x27;m not having a go at gay couples who do. I think if Elton and David want to have babies, that&#x27;s wonderful. I think we should all do what we want.&quot;

Everett has also disclosed that he identified as transgender during his childhood and dressed as a girl from age six to 14. When he turned 15, he ceased to identify as female and embraced his identity as a gay man. He has expressed opposition to the use of hormones on children, saying that parents who offered the possibility of such a transition to their children were &quot;scary&quot;.

Everett expressed his opposition to cancel culture in a 2020 interview with &quot;The Advocate.

<text>Frankincense, also known as olibanum (), is an aromatic resin used in incense and perfumes, obtained from trees of the genus &quot;Boswellia&quot; in the family Burseraceae. The word is from Old French (&#x27;high-quality incense&#x27;). There are several species of &quot;Boswellia&quot; that produce true frankincense: &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot; (syn. &quot;B. bhaw-dajiana&quot;, syn. &quot;B. carteri&quot;), &quot;B. frereana&quot;, &quot;B. serrata&quot; (&quot;B. thurifera&quot;), and &quot;B. papyrifera&quot;. Resin from each is available in various grades, which depends on the time of harvesting. The resin is hand-sorted for quality.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;frankincense&quot; derives from the Old French expression , meaning &#x27;true incense&#x27;, maybe with the sense of &#x27;high quality incense&#x27;. The adjective in Old French meant &#x27;noble, true&#x27;, in this case perhaps &#x27;pure&#x27;; although &quot;franc&quot; is ultimately derived from the tribal name of the Franks, it is not a direct reference to them in the word &quot;francincense&quot;.

The word for frankincense in the Koine Greek of the New Testament, (or ), is cognate with the name of Lebanon (); the same can be said with regard to Arabic, Phoenician, Hebrew, and . This is postulated to be because they both derive from the word for &#x27;white&#x27; and that the spice route went via Mount Lebanon ().
 derived from or . The leading &quot;o&quot; may have come from , or from the Greek article &quot;o-&quot; or Arabic article &quot;al-&quot;. Other names include , , , , , , , .

==Description==
The trees start producing resin at about eight to 10 years old. Tapping is done two to three times per year with the final taps producing the best tears because of their higher aromatic terpene, sesquiterpene and diterpene content. Generally speaking, the more opaque resins are the best quality. Today 90 percent of the world&#x27;s production of frankincense comes from the Horn of Africa, predominantly from the border communities on the Somalia–Ethiopia border. 

The main species in trade are:
* &quot;Boswellia frereana&quot; grows in northern Somalia.
* &quot;Boswellia occulta&quot;: Somalia. For a long time Somali harvesters considered &quot;Boswellia occulta&quot; to be the same species as &quot;Boswellia carteri&quot; even though their shapes are different, and sold resins from both species as the same thing. However in 2019, it was clear that the chemical compositions of their essential oils are completely different.
* &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;: Somalia, South Arabia.
** &quot;Boswellia bhaw-dajiana&quot; (older spelling &quot;Boswellia bhau-dajiana&quot;) It is a synonym of &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;
** &quot;Boswellia carteri&quot; (older spelling &quot;Boswellia carterii&quot;): It was long considered an independent species, but in the 1980s it was determined to be a synonym of &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;.
* &quot;Boswellia serrata&quot; (synonym &quot;Boswellia thurifera&quot;): India.
* &quot;Boswellia papyrifera&quot;: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan.

Recent studies indicate that frankincense tree populations are declining, partly from overexploitation. Heavily tapped trees produce seeds that germinate at only 16% while seeds of trees that had not been tapped germinate at more than 80%. In addition, burning, grazing, and attacks by the longhorn beetle have reduced the tree population. Clearing of frankincense woodlands for conversion to agriculture is also a major threat.

==Chemical composition==
These are some of the chemical compounds present in frankincense:
* acid resin (6%), soluble in alcohol and having the formula C20H32O4
* gum (similar to gum arabic) 30–36%
* 3-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid (&quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;)
* alpha-boswellic acid (&quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;)
* incensole acetate, C21H34O3
* phellandrene
* olibanic acid

Among various plants in the genus &quot;Boswellia&quot;, only &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;, &quot;Boswellia serrata&quot; and &quot;Boswellia papyrifera&quot; have been confirmed to contain significant amounts of boswellic acids.

==History==

Frankincense has been traded on the Somali and Arabian Peninsula for more than 5,000 years. Greek historian Herodotus wrote in &quot;The History&quot; that frankincense was harvested from trees in southern Arabia. He reported that the gum was dangerous to harvest because of winged snakes that guard the trees and that the smoke from burning storax would drive the snakes away. Pliny the Elder also mentioned frankincense in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot;.

Frankincense, which was used in the Roman Empire prior to the spread of Christianity, was reintroduced to Western Europe possibly by Frankish Crusaders and other Western Europeans on their journeys to the Eastern Roman Empire, where it was commonly used in church services. Although named &quot;frank&quot;incense, the name refers to the quality of incense brought to Western Europe, not to the Franks themselves.

Southern Arabia was an exporter of frankincense in antiquity, with some of it being traded as far as China. The 13th-century Chinese writer and customs inspector Zhao Rugua wrote that or (Chinese: / ) comes from the three &quot;Dashi&quot; states (Chinese: – Caliphate (Arab Muslims)) of &quot;Maloba&quot; (Murbat), &quot;Shihe&quot; (Shihr), and &quot;Nufa&quot; (Dhofar), from the depths of the remotest mountains; the trunk of the tree is notched with a hatchet, upon which the resin flows out, and, when hardened, turns into incense, which is gathered and made into lumps; it is transported on elephants to the &quot;Dashi&quot; ports, then on ship to Sanfoqi; which is why it was known as a product of Sanfoqi.

In Christian tradition, frankincense is one of the gifts given by the Biblical Magi to Jesus at his nativity as described in the Gospel of Matthew.

==Production==

Thousands of tons of frankincense are traded every year to be used in religious ceremonies as incense in thuribles and by makers of perfumes, natural medicines, and essential oils.

===Somalia===
In Somalia, frankincense is harvested in the Bari and Sanaag regions: mountains lying at the northwest of Erigavo; El Afweyn District; Cal Madow mountain range, a westerly escarpment that runs parallel to the coast; Cal Miskeed, including Hantaara and Habeeno plateau and a middle segment of the frankincense-growing escarpment; Karkaar mountains or eastern escarpment, which lies at the eastern fringe of the frankinscence escarpment.

===Oman===
In Dhofar, Oman, frankincense species grow north of Salalah. It was traded in the ancient coastal city of Sumhuram, now Khor Rori, and Al-Baleed, an ancient port. In 2000, UNESCO inscribed the sites as a World Heritage Site &quot;Land of Frankincense&quot;.

==Ecological status==
In 1998, the International Union for Conservation of Nature warned that one of the primary frankincense species, &quot;Boswellia sacra&quot;, is &quot;near threatened&quot;. Frankincense trees are not covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, but experts argue that &quot;Boswellia&quot; species meet the criteria for protection. In a 2006 study, an ecologist at Wageningen University &amp; Research claimed that, by the late-1990s, &quot;Boswellia papyrifera&quot; trees in Eritrea were becoming hard to find. In 2019, a new paper predicted a 50% reduction in &quot;Boswellia papyrifera&quot; within the next two decades. This species, found mainly in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan, accounts for about two-thirds of global frankincense production. The paper warns that all &quot;Boswellia&quot; species are threatened by habitat loss and overexploitation. Most &quot;Boswellia&quot; grow in harsh, arid regions beset by poverty and conflict. Harvesting and selling the tree&#x27;s resin is one of the few sources of income for the inhabitants, resulting in overtapping.

==Research==
Limited clinical studies have provided weak evidence for the use of frankincense resin in certain disease conditions, but the inconsistent, low quality of research remains inconclusive for determining any effect.

==Uses==

The Egyptians cleansed body cavities in the mummification process with frankincense and natron. In Persian medicine, it is used for diabetes, gastritis and stomach ulcer. The oil is used in Abrahamic religions to cleanse a house or building of bad or evil energy—including used in exorcisms and to bless one&#x27;s being (like the bakhoor commonly found in Persian Gulf cultures by spreading the fumes towards the body).

The incense offering occupied a prominent position in the sacrificial legislation of the ancient Hebrews. The Book of Exodus (30:34–38) prescribes frankincense, blended with equal amounts of three aromatic spices, to be ground and burnt in the sacred altar before the Ark of the Covenant in the wilderness Tabernacle, where it was meant to be a holy offering—not to be enjoyed for its fragrance. Scholars have identified frankincense as what the Book of Jeremiah (6:20) relates was imported from Sheba during the 6th century BC Babylonian captivity. Frankincense is mentioned in the New Testament as one of the three gifts (with gold and myrrh) that the magi &quot;from the East&quot; presented to the Christ Child ().

In traditional Chinese medicine, frankincense ( ) along with myrrh ( ) are considered to have anti-bacterial properties and blood-moving uses. It can be used topically or orally, also used in surgical and internal medicine of traditional Chinese medicine. It is used to relieve pain, remove blood stasis, promote blood circulation and treat deafness, stroke, locked jaw, and abnormalities in women&#x27;s menstruation.

===Essential oil===

The essential oil of frankincense is produced by steam distillation of the tree resin. The oil&#x27;s chemical components are 75% monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and ketones. Contrary to some commercial claims, steam distilled frankincense oils do not contain the insufficiently volatile boswellic acids (triterpenoids), although they may be present in solvent extractions. The chemistry of the essential oil is mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as alpha-pinene, Limonene, alpha-Thujene, and beta-Pinene with small amounts of diterpenoid components being the upper limit in terms of molecular weight.

Essential oils can be diluted and applied to skin or the fragrance can be inhaled.

<text>Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd (; 8 September 1901 – 6 September 1966), also known as H. F. Verwoerd, was a Dutch-born South African politician, scholar in applied psychology, philosophy, and sociology, and newspaper editor who was Prime Minister of South Africa from 1958 until his assassination in 1966. 

He is commonly regarded as the architect of apartheid and nicknamed the &quot;father of apartheid&quot;. Verwoerd played a significant role in socially engineering apartheid, the country&#x27;s system of institutionalized racial segregation and white supremacy, and implementing its policies, as Minister of Native Affairs (1950–1958) and then as prime minister (1958–1966). Furthermore, Verwoerd played a vital role in helping the far-right National Party come to power in 1948, serving as their political strategist and propagandist, becoming party leader upon his premiership. He was the Union of South Africa&#x27;s last prime minister, from 1958 to 1961, when he proclaimed the founding of the Republic of South Africa, remaining its prime minister until his assassination in 1966.

Verwoerd was an authoritarian, socially conservative leader and an Afrikaner nationalist. He was a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond (), a secret white and Calvinist organization dedicated to advancing the Afrikaner &quot;volk&quot; interests, and protested against South Africa&#x27;s declaration of war on Nazi Germany during World War II. Following the Nationalist electoral victory in 1948, Verwoerd assumed high positions in the government and wielded strong influence over South African society.

Verwoerd became prime minister in 1958. His desire to ensure white, and especially Afrikaner dominance in South Africa, to the exclusion of the nonwhite majority, was a major aspect of his support for a republic. When attempting to justify apartheid to international audiences, he branded it as a policy of &quot;good-neighbourliness&quot;, stating that as different races and cultures have different beliefs and values, they could only reach their full potential if they lived and developed apart from each other. He stated that the white minority had to be protected from the nonwhite majority by pursuing a &quot;policy of separate development&quot; and keeping power in the hands of whites. Apartheid saw the complete disfranchisement of the nonwhite population.

Verwoerd heavily repressed opposition to apartheid during his premiership. He ordered the detention and imprisonment of tens of thousands of people and the exile of further thousands, while at the same time greatly empowering, modernizing, and enlarging the white apartheid state&#x27;s security forces (police and military). He banned black organizations such as the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress, and it was under him that future president Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for life for sabotage. Verwoerd&#x27;s South Africa had one of the highest prison populations in the world and saw a large number of executions and floggings. By the mid-1960s Verwoerd&#x27;s government to a large degree had put down internal civil resistance to apartheid by employing extraordinary legislative power, draconian laws, psychological intimidation, and the relentless efforts of the white state&#x27;s security apparatus.

Although apartheid began in 1948 with D. F. Malan&#x27;s premiership, Verwoerd&#x27;s role in expanding and legally entrenching the system, including his theoretical justifications and opposition to the limited form of integration known as , have led him to be described as the &quot;Architect of Apartheid&quot;. His actions prompted the passing of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761, condemning apartheid, and ultimately leading to South Africa&#x27;s international isolation and economic sanctions. On 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was stabbed several times by parliamentary aide Dimitri Tsafendas. He died shortly after, and Tsafendas was jailed until his death in 1999.

== Early life ==

Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd was born in Amsterdam in the Netherlands on 8 September 1901. Verwoerd was South Africa&#x27;s only foreign-born prime minister. He was the second child of Anje Hendriks Strik (1873-1940) and Wilhelmus Johannes Verwoerd (1874-1961). His older brother was Leendert (Len) Verwoerd (1899-1986) and his younger sister, the only one born in South Africa, was Hendrika Johanna Lucretia (Lucie) Verwoerd (1908-1959). His father was a shopkeeper and a deeply religious man who decided to move his family to South Africa in 1903 because of his sympathy towards the Afrikaner nation in the wake of the Second Boer War. Verwoerd went to a Lutheran primary school in Wynberg, Cape Town. By the end of 1912, the Verwoerd family moved to Bulawayo, Rhodesia, where his father became an assistant evangelist in the Dutch Reformed Church. Verwoerd attended Milton High School, where he was awarded the Beit Scholarship, established by diamond magnate and financier Alfred Beit. Verwoerd received the top marks for English literature in Rhodesia.

In 1917, the family moved back to South Africa, since the congregation in Bulawayo had appointed a second minister of religion. His father took up a position in the church in Brandfort, Orange Free State. Due to the worldwide Spanish flu epidemic, the younger Verwoerd only sat for his matriculation exams in February 1919, achieving first position in the Orange Free State and fifth in country.

Verwoerd studied at Stellenbosch University, where he was regarded as a brilliant social science academic, and it was widely claimed that he possessed a photographic memory. Verwoerd was fluent in Afrikaans, Dutch, English and German. He obtained his B.A. with distinctions in Sociology, Psychology and Philosophy, and then completed his Masters cum laude. He then went on completing his Doctorate in Psychology in 1925 at Stellenbosch University. Verwoerd&#x27;s over three hundred page Doctorate thesis titled &quot;Die Afstomping van die Gemoedsaandoeninge&quot; (Afrikaans: The numbing of the Emotion) was at the time regarded as a monumental academic achievement in field of Applied Psychology in South Africa.

Due to the work undertaken by Verwoerd in his doctoral thesis , he was awarded two scholarships for post-doctoral research abroad—one by the Abe Bailey Trust to study at the University of Oxford, England, and another one to continue his studies in Germany. He opted for the latter, as Verwoerd wanted to continue his research under a number of renowned German psychology and philosophy professors of the time, and possibly due to his own anti-British views at the time. Verwoerd left for Germany in 1926, and proceeded to research psychology and sociology at the University of Hamburg, Berlin, and Leipzig. In Hamburg, he studied under William Stern; in Berlin, under Wolfgang Köhler and Otto Lipmann; and in Leipzig, under Felix Krueger. Most of these professors were not allowed to teach anymore once the Nazis came to power in 1933.. Claims that Verwoerd studied eugenics during his German sojourn and later based his apartheid policy on Nazi ideology, are still being evaluated by scholars. Critics contend that eugenics was usually taught at medical faculties during this period. Christoph Marx asserts that Verwoerd kept a conspicuous distance from eugenic theories and racist social technologies, emphasising environmental influences rather than hereditary abilities.

Verwoerd&#x27;s fiancée, Betsie Schoombie, joined him in Germany and they were married in Hamburg on 7 January 1927. Later that year, he continued his studies in the United Kingdom, and then proceeded to the United States. His lecture notes and memoranda at Stellenbosch University stressed that there were no biological differences between the big racial groups, and concluded that &quot;this was not really a factor in the development of a higher social civilization by the Caucasians.&quot; Verwoerd&#x27;s views on race were more likely influenced by his experience of American attitudes towards racial segregation than National Socialists in Germany.

== Return to South Africa ==

Verwoerd returned with his wife to South Africa in 1928 and was appointed to the chair of Applied Psychology and Psycho Technique at the University of Stellenbosch where, six years later, he became Professor of Sociology and Social Work. During the Great Depression, Verwoerd became active in social work among poor white South Africans. He devoted much attention to welfare work and was often consulted by welfare organizations, while he served on numerous committees.

Afrikaans politics from 1910 to 1948 were divided between the &quot;liberals&quot; such as Jan Smuts who argued for a reconciliation with Britain vs. the &quot;extremists&quot; who expressed anti-British sentiments due to the Boer War. Both the &quot;liberals&quot; and the &quot;extremists&quot; believed that South Africa was a &quot;white man&#x27;s country&quot;, though the latter were more stridently committed to white supremacy. Verwoerd belonged to the anti-British faction in Afrikaans politics who wanted to keep as much distance as possible from Britain.

In 1936, Verwoerd, joined by a group of Stellenbosch University professors, protested against the immigration of German Jews to South Africa, who were fleeing Nazi persecution. His efforts in the field of national welfare drew him into politics and in 1936 he was offered the first editorship of &quot;Die Transvaler&quot;, a position which he took up in 1937, with the added responsibility of helping to rebuild the National Party in the Transvaal.

&quot;Die Transvaler&quot; was a publication which supported the aspirations of Afrikaner nationalism, agricultural and labour rights. Combining republicanism, populism and protectionism, the paper helped &quot;solidify the sentiments of most South Africans, that changes to the socio-economic system were vitally needed.&quot; With the start of the Second World War in September 1939, Verwoerd protested against South Africa&#x27;s role in the conflict when the country declared war on Germany, siding with its former colonial power, the United Kingdom.

In 1943, Verwoerd, editor of &quot;Die Transvaler&quot;, sued the English-language newspaper &quot;The Star&quot; for libel after it accused him of being a Nazi propagandist. In his judgment dismissing the case, Justice Mallin stated that Verwoerd &quot;did support Nazi propaganda, he did make his paper a tool of Nazis in South Africa, and he knew it&quot; (cited by Scheub 2010, 42; Bunting 1964, 106–107). &quot;Die Transvaler&quot; had triumphantly headlined every Nazi victory and constantly attacked &quot;British Jewish liberalism.&quot;

==Government service==

The South African general election of 1948 was held on 26 May 1948 and saw the Nationalist Party together with the Afrikaner Party winning the general elections. Malan&#x27;s Herenigde Nasionale Party (HNP) concluded an election pact with the Afrikaner Party in 1947. They won the elections with a very narrow majority of five seats in Parliament, although they only got 40 percent of the voter support. This was due to the loaded constituencies in cities, which was to the advantage of rural constituencies. The nine Afrikaner Party MPs thus made it possible for Malan&#x27;s HNP to form a coalition government with the Afrikaner Party of Klasie Havenga. The two parties amalgamated in 1951 as the National Party, although Havenga was not comfortable with NP policy to remove coloured voters from the common voters&#x27; roll.

Running on the platform of self-determination and apartheid as it was termed for the first time, Prime Minister Daniel Malan and his party benefited from their support in the rural electorates, defeating General Jan Christiaan Smuts and his United Party. General Smuts lost his own seat of Standerton. Most party leaders agreed that the nationalist policies were responsible for the National Party&#x27;s victory. To further cement their nationalist policies, Herenigde Nasionale Party leader Daniel Malan called for stricter enforcement of job reservation protecting the rights of the white working class, and the rights of white workers to organise their own labour unions outside of company control.

Verwoerd was elected to the Senate of South Africa later that year, and became the minister of native affairs under Prime Minister Malan in 1950, until his appointment as prime minister in 1958. In that position, he helped to implement the Nationalist Party&#x27;s programme.

Among the laws that were drawn and enacted during Verwoerd&#x27;s time as minister for native affairs were the Population Registration Act and the Group Areas Act in 1950, the Pass Laws Act of 1952 and the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953. Verwoerd wrote the Bantu Education Act, which was to have a deleterious effect on the ability of black South Africans to be educated. Verwoerd himself noted that the purpose of the Bantu Education Act was to ensure that blacks would have only just enough education to work as unskilled labourers.

The Bantu Education Act ensured that black South Africans had only the barest minimum of education, thus entrenching the role of blacks in the apartheid economy as a cheap source of unskilled labour. In June 1954, Verwoerd in a speech stated: &quot;The Bantu must be guided to serve his own community in all respects. There is no place for him in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour. Within his own community, however, all doors are open&quot;.

One black South African woman who worked as an anti-apartheid activist, Nomavenda Mathiane, in particular criticized Verwoerd for the Bantu Education Act of 1953, which caused generations of black South Africans to suffer an inferior education, saying: &quot;After white people had taken the land, after white people had impoverished us in South Africa, the only way out of our poverty was through education. And he came up with the idea of giving us an inferior education.&quot;

==Prime minister==

Prime Minister Daniel Malan announced his retirement from politics following the National Party&#x27;s success in the elections of 1953. In the succession debate that followed Malan&#x27;s retirement in 1954, N. C. Havenga and J. G. Strijdom were potential successors. The Young Turks of the Transvaal got the upper hand and thus J. G. Strijdom was elected as the new leader of the National Party, succeeding Malan as Prime Minister.

Verwoerd gradually gained popularity with the Afrikaner electorate and continued to expand his political support. With his overwhelming constituency victory in the 1958 election and the death shortly thereafter of Prime Minister J. G. Strijdom, Verwoerd was nominated, together with Eben Dönges and C. R. Swart from the Orange Free State, as candidates to head the party. Verwoerd got the most votes in the second round and thus succeeded Strijdom as Prime Minister.

==Apartheid==

Hendrik Verwoerd is often called the architect of apartheid for his role in shaping the implementation of apartheid policy when he was minister of native affairs and then prime minister. Verwoerd once described apartheid as a &quot;policy of good neighbourliness&quot;.

At the time that the NP came to power in 1948, there were factional differences in the party about the implementation of systemic racial segregation. The larger faction, while favouring segregation, also favoured the participation of black Africans in the economy as long as black labour could be controlled to advance the economic gains of Afrikaners. A second faction were the &quot;purists&quot;, who believed in &quot;vertical segregation&quot;, under which blacks and whites would be entirely separated, with blacks living in native reserves, with separate political and economic structures, which, they believed, would entail severe short-term pain, but would also lead to independence of white South Africa from black labour in the long-term. Verwoerd belonged to a third faction, which sympathised with the purists, but allowed for the use of black labour, while implementing the purist goal of vertical separation.

Verwoerd&#x27;s vision of a South Africa divided into multiple ethno-states appealed to the reform-minded Afrikaner intelligentsia, and it provided a more coherent philosophical and moral framework for the National Party&#x27;s racist policies, while also providing a veneer of intellectual respectability to the previously crude policy of &quot;baasskap&quot;. Verwoerd felt that the political situation of South Africa had become stagnant over the past century and called for reform.

Under the Premiership of Verwoerd, the following legislative acts relating to apartheid were introduced:

# Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959
# Bantu Investment Corporation Act, 1959
# Extension of University Education Act, 1959

==Republic==

The creation of a republic was one of the National Party&#x27;s long-term goals since originally coming to power in 1948. In January 1960, Verwoerd announced that a referendum would be called to determine the republican issue, the objective being a republic within the Commonwealth. Two weeks later, Harold Macmillan, then British Prime Minister, visited South Africa.

In an address to both Houses of Parliament, Macmillan gave his famous Winds of Change speech. The speech, which implicitly criticized apartheid, together with the worldwide criticism following the Sharpeville massacre, created a siege mentality in South Africa. Verwoerd seized upon this to booster his case for a republic, presenting Elizabeth II as the ruler of a hostile power.

Verwoerd also ensured that South African media gave generous coverage of the breakdown of society in the Congo in the summer of 1960 following independence from Belgium as an example of the sort of &quot;horrors&quot; that allegedly would ensue in South Africa if apartheid was ended. He then linked the Congo situation to the criticism of apartheid in Britain, arguing the Congolese &quot;horrors&quot; were what the British government was intent upon inflicting on white South Africans (via their opposition to apartheid), fanning the flames of Anglophobia.

In order to bolster support for a republic, the voting age for whites was lowered from 21 to 18, benefiting younger Afrikaans speakers, who were more likely to favour a republic, and the franchise was extended to whites in South-West Africa, most of whom were German or Afrikaans speakers. This was done even though English South Africans were slightly outnumbered by Afrikaners. The vast majority of English South Africans were against South Africa becoming a republic and were still loyal to the British Crown, especially in Natal, where anti-republican and secessionist sentiment was very strong.

The 1960 South Africa referendum was accepted by Parliament. In March 1961 at the 1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in London, Verwoerd abandoned an attempt for South Africa to become a republic within the Commonwealth, which was necessary given the intention to declare a republic following a resolution jointly sponsored by Jawaharlal Nehru of India and John Diefenbaker of Canada declaring that racism was incompatible with Commonwealth membership. Verwoerd abandoned the application to rejoin the Commonwealth after the Indo-Canadian resolution was accepted mostly by votes from non-white nations (Canada was the only majority white country to vote for the resolution), and stormed out of the conference. For many white South Africans, especially those of British extraction, leaving the Commonwealth imposed a certain psychological sense of isolation as South Africa left a club that it had belonged to since 1910 and of which it had been a prominent member. The Republic of South Africa came into existence on 31 May 1961, the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging that had brought the Second Boer War to an end in 1902, and the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910. The Anglophobic Verwoerd timed the declaration of a republic with the anniversary of the Treaty of Vereeniging as a form of revenge for the defeat of the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State in the Boer War. The last Governor-General, Charles Robberts Swart, took office as the first State President.

After South Africa became a republic, Verwoerd refused to accept black ambassadors from Commonwealth member states. Verwoerd&#x27;s overt moves to block non-whites from representing South Africa in sports—starting with cricket—started the international movement to ostracise South Africa from international sporting competition. The last Olympic Games in which the country participated—until the abolition of apartheid—was in 1960. South Africa was expelled from FIFA in 1976, and whenever South African teams did participate in sports, protests and disruptions were the result. When supporters of South Africa decried their exclusion, the usual response was: &quot;Who started it?&quot;, in reference to Verwoerd.

== First assassination attempt ==

On 9 April 1960, Verwoerd opened the Union Exposition in Milner Park, Johannesburg, to mark the jubilee of the Union of South Africa. After Verwoerd delivered his opening address, David Pratt, a rich English businessman and farmer from the Magaliesberg, near Pretoria, attempted to assassinate Verwoerd, firing two shots from a .22 pistol at point-blank range, one bullet perforating Verwoerd&#x27;s right cheek and the second his right ear.

Colonel G. M. Harrison, president of the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society, leapt up and knocked the pistol from the gunman&#x27;s hand. After the pistol fell to the floor, Harrison, with the help of Major Carl Richter, the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal bodyguard, civilians and another policeman overpowered the gunman. He was taken to the Marshall Square police station and later transferred to the Forensic Medical Laboratory due to his peculiar behaviour.

Within minutes of the assassination attempt, Verwoerd—still conscious and blood gushing from his face—was rushed to the nearby Johannesburg Hospital. Two days later, the hospital issued a statement which described his condition as &#x27;indeed satisfactory—further examinations were carried out today and they confirm good expectations. Dr. Verwoerd at present is restful. There is no need for any immediate operation.&#x27; Once his condition stabilised, Verwoerd was transferred to a Pretoria hospital. The neurologists who treated Verwoerd later stated that his escape had been &#x27;absolutely miraculous&#x27;. Specialist surgeons were called in to remove the bullets. At first, there was speculation that Verwoerd would lose his hearing and sense of balance, but this was to prove groundless. He returned to public life on 29 May, less than two months after the shooting.

David Pratt was initially held under the emergency regulations, declared on 30 March 1960, nine days after the Sharpeville massacre and shortly after Verwoerd received a death threat with a red note reading, &quot;Today we kill Verwoerd&quot;. Pratt appeared for a preliminary hearing in the Johannesburg Magistrates&#x27; Court on 20 and 21 July 1960, once it was clear that the attempt was not fatal.

Pratt claimed that he had been shooting &#x27;the epitome of apartheid&#x27;. However, in his defence, he stated that he only wanted to injure, not kill, Verwoerd. The court accepted the medical reports submitted to it by five different psychiatrists, all of which confirmed that Pratt lacked legal capacity and could not be held criminally liable for having shot the prime minister. On 26 September 1960, he was committed to a mental hospital in Bloemfontein. On 1 October 1961, his 53rd birthday, he committed suicide, shortly before parole was to be considered. His cause of death is disputed, since many apparent suicides during the apartheid era were actually murders and killings by police.

== Solidifying the system ==

In 1961, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld visited South Africa where he could not reach an agreement with Prime Minister Verwoerd. On 6 November 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 1761, condemning South African apartheid policies. On 7 August 1963, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 181 calling for a voluntary arms embargo against South Africa, and in the same year, a Special Committee Against Apartheid was established to encourage and oversee plans of action against the authorities.

From 1964, the US and UK discontinued their arms trade with South Africa. Economic sanctions against South Africa were also frequently debated in the UN as an effective way of putting pressure on the apartheid government. In 1962, the UN General Assembly requested that its members sever political, fiscal and transportation ties with South Africa.

== 1966 general elections ==

The National Party under Verwoerd won the 1966 general election. The election marked a major strengthening of power for the ruling NP, which gained a two-thirds majority in parliament for the first time. During this period, the National Party government continued to foster the development of a military industrial complex, that successfully pioneered developments in native armaments manufacturing, including aircraft, small arms, armoured vehicles, and even nuclear and biological weapons.

Three days before his death, Verwoerd had held talks with the Prime Minister of Lesotho, Chief Leabua Jonathan, at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. Following the meeting, a joint communique was issued by the two governments with special emphasis on &quot;co-operation without interference in each others&#x27; internal affairs&quot;.

== Assassination ==

On 6 September 1966, Verwoerd was stabbed to death in Cape Town, shortly after entering the House of Assembly at 14:15. A uniformed parliamentary messenger named Dimitri Tsafendas stabbed Verwoerd in the neck and chest four times before being subdued by other members of the Assembly. Four members of Parliament who were also trained doctors rushed to the aid of Verwoerd and started administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Verwoerd was rushed to Groote Schuur Hospital, but was pronounced dead upon arrival.

=== Funeral ===
Verwoerd&#x27;s state funeral, attended by a quarter of a million people, was held in Pretoria on 10 September 1966, during which his South African flag-draped casket was laid on an artillery carriage towed by a military truck. He was buried in the Heroes&#x27; Acre in Pretoria. The still blood-stained carpet where Verwoerd lay after his murder remained in Parliament until it was removed in 2004.

=== Aftermath ===
Over the days that followed the assassination, Tsafendas was questioned by the police while in custody, while the police turned every possible stone in order to obtain as much information as possible. Under questioning, Tsafendas made coherent statements explaining that he had committed his act in the hope that after Verwoerd&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot; &quot;a change of policy would take place.&quot; He added, &quot;I wanted to see a government representing all the South African people. I do not think the Nationalist Government is representative of the people and I wanted to see a different government … I did not care about the consequences, for what would happen to me afterwards. I didn&#x27;t care much and didn&#x27;t give it a second thought that I would be caught. I was so disgusted with the racial policy that I went through with my plans to kill the prime minister.&quot;

At the same time, the South African police gathered a plethora of evidence of Tsafendas&#x27;s long history of political activism, from his membership of the South African Communist Party (SACP) between 1936 and 1942 to his time in London in the early 1960s, when he had attended meetings of the Committee of African Organizations and had held &quot;the posters up&quot; at &quot;anti-colonial&quot;, &quot;anti-apartheid&quot; and &quot;anti-racial&quot; meetings; in South Africa from 1939 to 1942, he had &quot;engaged actively in Communistic propaganda&quot;; he had fought on the Communist side in the Greek Civil War of 1947–49; and in London he had been a close associate and assistant of the ANC&#x27;s local representative, Tennyson Makiwane. In short, and according to his own words, he was &quot;anti-colonial, against slavery and in favour of all colonies which were controlled by Belgium, France and Portugal to be afforded self-government.&quot;

Nevertheless, none of these became known during a summary trial where Tsafendas escaped the death penalty on the grounds of insanity. Judge Andries Beyers ordered Tsafendas to be imprisoned indefinitely at the &quot;State President&#x27;s pleasure&quot;; in 1999 he died aged 81 still in detention.

== Legacy ==


The town of Orania in the Northern Cape province houses the Verwoerd collection—memorabilia collected during Verwoerd&#x27;s lifetime which is now on display in the house where his widow lived for the last years before her death in 2000 at the age of 98. Verwoerd&#x27;s legacy in South Africa today is a controversial one as for black South Africans, Verwoerd was and still is regarded as the epitome of evil, the white supremacist who become a symbol of apartheid itself. Apparently, most white South Africans now speak of Verwoerd as an embarrassment and only a minority still praise him. However, in 2004 Verwoerd was elected by popular poll as one of the top 20 South Africans of all time in the TV show Great South Africans. Melanie Verwoerd, who was married to Verwoerd&#x27;s grandson Willem, joined the African National Congress (ANC) (like her ex-husband). She recalled that bearing the surname Verwoerd always produced awkward stares in ANC circles when she introduced herself and she had to explain that she was indeed the granddaughter-in-law of the Verwoerd who was the prime minister.

In 1992, Verwoerd&#x27;s widow, Betsie Verwoerd, moved to Orania, the Afrikaner settlement founded by her son-in-law. She was visited by the first democratically elected president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, at her home in 1995.

On the 50th anniversary of Verwoerd&#x27;s assassination in 2016, some in South Africa argued that Tsafendas should be regarded as an anti-apartheid hero.

Many major roads, places and facilities in cities and towns of South Africa were named after Verwoerd; in post-apartheid South Africa, there has been a campaign to take down statues of Verwoerd and rename buildings and streets named after him. Famous examples include H. F. Verwoerd Airport in Port Elizabeth, renamed Port Elizabeth Airport, the Verwoerd Dam in the Free State, now the Gariep Dam, H. F. Verwoerd academic hospital in Pretoria, now Steve Biko Hospital, and the town of Verwoerdburg, now Centurion.

Journalist Daniel A. Gross proposed that the campaign against Verwoerd as the &quot;architect of apartheid&quot; was going too far in the sense that it was too convenient to blame all the wrongs and injustices of apartheid on one man who was designated as being especially evil, stating that many people were involved in creating and maintaining the apartheid system. Gross concluded that blaming everything on Verwoerd was in effect excusing the actions of everyone else who supported apartheid.

==Depiction on coins==

Verwoerd is depicted on the obverses of a pair of .800 fine Silver 1 Rand coins dated 1967, which was struck to commemorate him.

<text>Roy Marcus Cohn ( ; February 20, 1927 – August 2, 1986) was an American lawyer and prosecutor known for his role as Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s chief counsel during the Army–McCarthy hearings in 1954, when he assisted McCarthy&#x27;s investigations of suspected communists. In the 1970s and during the 1980s, he became a prominent political fixer in New York City. He represented and mentored Donald Trump during Trump&#x27;s early business career. 

Cohn was born in the Bronx in New York City and educated at Columbia University. He rose to prominence as a U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor at the espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, where he successfully prosecuted the Rosenbergs, which led to their conviction and execution in 1953. After his time as prosecuting chief counsel during the McCarthy trials, his reputation deteriorated during the late 1950s to late 1970s after McCarthy&#x27;s downfall.

In 1986, Cohn was disbarred by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court for unethical conduct after attempting to defraud a dying client by forcing the client to sign a will amendment leaving him his fortune. He died five weeks later from AIDS-related complications, having vehemently denied that he was HIV-positive. Cohn has been the subject of many media portrayals before and since his death.

==Early life and education==
Born to an affluent Jewish family in the Bronx, New York City, Cohn was the only child of Dora ( Marcus; 1892–1967) and Justice Albert C. Cohn (1885–1959); Cohn&#x27;s father was an assistant district attorney of Bronx County at the time, who was appointed as a judge of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, later in his life. His maternal great-uncle was Joshua Lionel Cowen, the founder and long-time owner of the Lionel Corporation, a manufacturer of toy trains.

Cohn and his mother were close; they lived together until her death in 1967 and she was constantly attentive to his grades, appearance and relationships. When Cohn&#x27;s father insisted that his son be sent to a summer camp, his mother rented a house near the camp and her presence cast a pall over his experience. In personal interactions, Cohn showed tenderness which was absent from his public persona, but he was vain and deeply insecure.

Cohn&#x27;s maternal grandfather Joseph S. Marcus founded the Bank of United States in 1913. The bank failed in 1931 during the Great Depression, and its then-president Bernie Marcus, Cohn&#x27;s uncle, was convicted of fraud. Bernie Marcus was imprisoned at Sing Sing, and the young Cohn frequently visited him there. 

After attending Fieldston School and the Horace Mann School and completing studies at Columbia University in 1946, Cohn graduated from Columbia Law School at the age of 20.

==Early career==
After graduating from law school, Cohn worked as a clerk for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for two years. In May 1948, at age 21, he was old enough to be admitted to the New York bar. He became an assistant U.S. attorney later that month. That same year, Cohn also became a board member of the American Jewish League Against Communism.

As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, Cohn helped to secure convictions in a number of well-publicized trials of accused Soviet moles. One of the first began in December 1950 with the prosecution of William Remington, a former Commerce Department employee and member of the War Production Board who had been charged with espionage following the defection of former KGB handler Elizabeth Bentley. Although an indictment for espionage could not be secured, Remington had denied his long-time membership in the Communist Party USA under oath on two separate occasions and was later convicted of perjury in two separate trials.

While working in Irving H. Saypol&#x27;s office for the Southern District of New York, Cohn assisted with the prosecutor&#x27;s case against 11 senior members of the American Communist Party for advocating for the violent overthrow of the U.S. Federal Government, under the Smith Act.

==Rosenberg trial==

Cohn played a prominent role in the 1951 espionage trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Cohn&#x27;s direct examination of Ethel&#x27;s brother, David Greenglass, produced testimony that was central to the Rosenbergs&#x27; conviction and subsequent execution. Greenglass testified that he had assisted the espionage activities of his brother-in-law by acting as a courier of classified documents that had been stolen from the Manhattan Project by Klaus Fuchs.

Greenglass would later change his story and allege that he committed perjury at the trial in order &quot;to protect himself and his wife, Ruth, and that he was encouraged by the prosecution to do so.&quot; Cohn always took great pride in the Rosenberg verdict and claimed to have played an even greater part than his public role. He said in his autobiography that his own influence had led to both Chief Prosecutor Saypol and Judge Irving Kaufman being appointed to the case. Cohn further said that Kaufman imposed the death penalty based on his personal recommendation. Cohn denied, however, participation in any illegal discussions.

Consensus among historians is that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of being a highly valued NKVD spymaster against the United States, but that his trial was marred by prosecutorial misconduct – mainly by Cohn – and that the Rosenbergs should not have been executed. Distilling this consensus, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz wrote that the Rosenbergs were &quot;guilty – and framed.&quot;

==Work with Joseph McCarthy==
The Rosenberg trial brought the 24-year-old Cohn to the attention of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover. With support from Hoover and Cardinal Spellman, Hearst columnist George Sokolsky convinced Joseph McCarthy to hire Cohn as his chief counsel, choosing him over Robert F. Kennedy. Cohn assisted McCarthy with his work for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, becoming known for his aggressive questioning of suspected Communists. Cohn preferred not to hold hearings in open forums, which went well with McCarthy&#x27;s preference for holding &quot;executive sessions&quot; and &quot;off-the-record&quot; sessions away from the Capitol to minimize public scrutiny and to question witnesses with relative impunity. Cohn was given free rein in pursuit of many investigations, with McCarthy joining in only for the more publicized sessions.

Cohn played a major role in McCarthy&#x27;s anti-Communist hearings. During the Lavender Scare, Cohn and McCarthy alleged that Soviet Bloc intelligence services had blackmailed multiple U.S. Federal Government employees into committing espionage in return for not exposing their closeted homosexuality. In response, President Dwight Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450 on April 27, 1953, to ban homosexuals, whom he considered a national security risk, from being employed by the federal government. According to David L. Marcus, Cohn&#x27;s cousin, many Federal employees in Washington, D.C., who were exposed as homosexuals by Cohn and McCarthy committed suicide. As time went on, it became well known that Cohn was himself gay, although he always denied it. McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of many gay men from government employment, and strong-armed opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality. Former U.S. Senator Alan K. Simpson wrote: &quot;The so-called &#x27;Red Scare&#x27; has been the main focus of most historians of that period of time. A lesser-known element…and one that harmed far more people was the witch-hunt McCarthy and others conducted against homosexuals.&quot;

Sokolsky introduced G. David Schine, an anti-Communist propagandist, to Cohn, who invited him to join McCarthy&#x27;s staff as an unpaid consultant. When Schine was drafted into the US Army in 1953, Cohn made extensive efforts to procure special treatment for him, even threatening to &quot;wreck the Army&quot; if his demands were not met. That conflict, along with McCarthy&#x27;s claims that there were Communists in the Defense Department, led to the Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954, during which the Army charged Cohn and McCarthy with using improper pressure on Schine&#x27;s behalf, and McCarthy and Cohn countercharged that the Army was holding Schine &quot;hostage&quot; in an attempt to squelch McCarthy&#x27;s investigations into Communists in the Army. The Army-McCarthy hearings ultimately contributed to McCarthy&#x27;s censure by the Senate later that year. After resigning from McCarthy&#x27;s staff, Cohn returned to New York and entered private practice as an attorney.

==Legal career in New York==
After resigning from McCarthy&#x27;s staff, Cohn had a 30-year career as an attorney in New York City. His clients included Donald Trump; New York Yankees baseball club owner George Steinbrenner; Aristotle Onassis; Mafia figures Tony Salerno, Carmine Galante, John Gotti and Mario Gigante; Studio 54 owners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager; the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York; Texas financier and philanthropist Shearn Moody Jr.; and business owner Richard Dupont. Dupont, then 48, was convicted of aggravated harassment and attempted grand larceny for his attempts at coercing further representation by Cohn for a bogus claim to property ownership in a case against the actual owner of 644 Greenwich Street, Manhattan, where Dupont had operated Big Gym, and from where he had been evicted in January 1979. Cohn&#x27;s other clients included retired Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who has referenced Cohn as &quot;the quintessential fixer&quot;. Following federal investigations during Cohn&#x27;s legal career in the 1970s and 1980s, Cohn was charged three times with professional misconduct, including perjury and witness tampering, and he was accused in New York of financial improprieties related to city contracts and private investments. He was acquitted on all charges.

== Political activities ==

In 1979, Cohn became a member of the Western Goals Foundation; he served on the board of directors with Edward Teller. Although he was registered as a Democrat, Cohn supported most of the Republican presidents of his time and Republicans in major offices across New York. He maintained close ties in conservative political circles, serving as an informal advisor to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. While aligning himself with Republicans he simultaneously forged close ties to Democrats including New York mayor Ed Koch, Secretary of State Carmine DeSapio, and Brooklyn party boss Meade Esposito.

In 1972, he helped Nixon discredit the candidacy of George McGovern&#x27;s Vice Presidential running mate Thomas Eagleton by leaking Eagleton&#x27;s medical records to the press. Eagleton&#x27;s medical record unveiled that he had been treated for depression.

During the years of debate over the passage of New York&#x27;s first gay rights bill, Cohn would align himself with the Archdiocese of New York and express his conviction that &quot;homosexual teachers are a grave threat to our children&quot;. 

=== Association with Ronald Reagan ===

Cohn worked on the 1980 Reagan campaign, where he befriended Roger Stone. Cohn aided Roger Stone in Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1979–1980, helping Stone arrange for John B. Anderson to get the nomination of the Liberal Party of New York, a move that would help split the opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone said Cohn gave him a suitcase that Stone avoided opening and, as instructed by Cohn, he dropped it off at the office of a lawyer influential in Liberal Party circles. Reagan carried the state with 46% of the vote to Carter&#x27;s 44%, with Anderson taking over 7% of the vote. Speaking after the statute of limitations for bribery had expired, Stone said, &quot;I paid his law firm. Legal fees. I don&#x27;t know what he did for the money, but whatever it was, the Liberal Party reached its right conclusion out of a matter of principle.&quot;

Rupert Murdoch was a client, and Cohn repeatedly pressured President Ronald Reagan to further Murdoch&#x27;s interests. He is credited with introducing Trump and Murdoch, in the mid-1970s, marking the beginning of what was to be a long association between the two.

===Representation of Donald Trump===

In 1971, Donald Trump first undertook large construction projects in Manhattan. In 1973, the Justice Department accused Trump of violating the Fair Housing Act in 39 of his properties. The government alleged that Trump&#x27;s corporation quoted different rental terms and conditions and made false &quot;no vacancy&quot; statements to African Americans for apartments it managed in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Representing Trump, Cohn filed a countersuit against the government for $100 million, asserting that the charges were &quot;irresponsible and baseless&quot;. The countersuit was unsuccessful. Trump settled the charges out of court in 1975, saying he was satisfied that the agreement did not &quot;compel the Trump organization to accept persons on welfare as tenants unless as qualified as any other tenant.&quot; The corporation was required to send a bi-weekly list of vacancies to the New York Urban League, a civil rights group, and give the league priority for certain locations. In 1978, the Trump Organization was again in court for violating terms of the 1975 settlement; Cohn called the new charges &quot;nothing more than a rehash of complaints by a couple of planted malcontents.&quot; Trump denied the charges. Cohn had represented mobsters in the past like Carmine Galante and Anthony Salerno. Salerno and Paul Castellano at the time controlled the concrete unions in Manhattan and, when Donald Trump needed concrete, he received it from union leader John Cody who was linked to mob boss Castellano.

==Lionel trains==
Cohn was the grand-nephew of Joshua Lionel Cowen, founder of the Lionel model train company. By 1959, Cowen and his son Lawrence had become involved in a family dispute over control of the company. In October 1959, Cohn and a group of investors stepped in and gained control of the company, having bought 200,000 of the firm&#x27;s 700,000 shares, which were purchased by his syndicate from the Cowens and on the open market over a three-month period prior to the takeover. Under Cohn&#x27;s three-and-a-half-year leadership, Lionel was plagued by declining sales, quality-control problems and huge financial losses. In 1963, Cohn was forced to resign from the company after losing a proxy fight.

== Disbarment and death ==
In 1986, a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court disbarred Cohn for unethical and unprofessional conduct, including misappropriation of clients&#x27; funds, lying on a bar application, and falsifying a change to a will. The last charge arose from an incident in 1975, when Cohn entered the hospital room of the dying and unconscious Lewis Rosenstiel, forced a pen into his hand, and lifted it to a document appointing himself and Cathy Frank, Rosenstiel&#x27;s granddaughter, executors. The resulting marks were determined in court to be indecipherable and in no way a valid signature. Despite the disbarment, many famous people showed up as character witnesses including Barbara Walters, &quot;Firing Line&quot; host William F. Buckley Jr. and Donald Trump.
In 1984, Cohn was diagnosed with AIDS and attempted to keep his condition secret while receiving experimental drug treatment. He participated in clinical trials of AZT, a drug initially synthesized to treat cancer but later developed as the first anti-HIV agent for AIDS patients. He insisted until his dying day that his disease was liver cancer. He died on August 2, 1986, in Bethesda, Maryland, of complications from AIDS, at the age of 59. After his death, the IRS seized almost everything he had including his house, cars, bank accounts, and other personal property and assets. One of the things that the IRS did not seize was a pair of knock-off diamond cufflinks, given to him by his client and friend Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahler_Flegenheimer_6/20/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roger Stone, Cohn&#x27;s &quot;absolute goal was to die completely broke and owing millions to the IRS. He succeeded in that.&quot; 

Cohn was buried in Union Field Cemetery in Queens, New York. His tombstone describes him as a lawyer and a patriot. His AIDS Memorial Quilt panel is white with &quot;Roy Cohn. Bully. Coward. Victim&quot; in black letters, with &quot;bully&quot; in red and &quot;coward&quot; in yellow.

== Personal life ==

Cohn dated Barbara Walters in college and remained friends with her. SI Newhouse, heir to the Condé Nast publishing empire, was Cohn&#x27;s classmate at Horace Mann, and they remained lifelong friends. Cohn described Generoso Pope as &quot;a second father&quot;. Cohn exchanged Christmas gifts with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover; they attended parties with their mutual friend, Lewis Rosenstiel, founder of liquor company Schenley Industries. Cohn referred to Donald Trump as his best friend. Cohn told journalists that Trump phoned him 15 to 20 times a day and according to Christine Seymour, his long-time switchboard operator, Trump was the last person to speak to Cohn on the phone before he died in 1986. 

Cohn had many influential social contacts. According to Seymour, he had frequent phone calls with Nancy Reagan, and former CIA director William Casey &quot;called Roy almost daily during [Reagan&#x27;s] 1st election.&quot; Both Casey and Cohn were reportedly close with Craig J. Spence, an influential Republican lobbyist. Cohn met Alan Dershowitz when they worked together on the Claus von Bülow case and praised Dershowitz&#x27;s support for Israel. Cohn was also friends with Estée Lauder, William F. Buckley Jr., and New York City mayor Abraham Beame.

=== Sexuality ===
When Cohn recruited G. David Schine as chief consultant to the McCarthy staff, speculation arose that Schine and Cohn had a sexual relationship. Schine&#x27;s chauffeur later volunteered to testify that he had seen the two &quot;engaged in homosexual acts&quot; in the back of his limousine, though there was no evidence that Schine ever had any romantic feelings for Cohn. During this period, Schine dated the actress Piper Laurie, and he eventually married Hillevi Rombin, a former Miss Universe, with whom he had six children. During the Army–McCarthy hearings, Cohn denied having any &quot;special interest&quot; in Schine or being bound to him &quot;closer than to the ordinary friend&quot;. Joseph Welch, the Army&#x27;s attorney in the hearings, made an apparent reference to Cohn&#x27;s homosexuality. After asking a witness, at McCarthy&#x27;s request, if a photo entered as evidence &quot;came from a pixie&quot;, Welch defined &quot;pixie&quot; as &quot;a close relative of a fairy&quot;. &quot;Pixie&quot; was a camera-model name at the time; &quot;fairy&quot; is a derogatory term for a homosexual man. The people at the hearing recognized the implication, and found it amusing; Cohn later called the remark &quot;malicious&quot;, &quot;wicked&quot;, and &quot;indecent&quot;.

The young Cohn also attached himself to several older powerful men who, in return, provided Cohn with assistance. One of them may have been New York&#x27;s Cardinal Francis Spellman, whose own alleged homosexuality has been a subject of controversy in the Catholic Church. Although Cohn always denied his homosexuality in public, he had a few known boyfriends over the course of his life, including his assistant Russell Eldridge, who died from AIDS in 1984, and Peter Fraser, Cohn&#x27;s partner for the last two years of his life, who was 30 years his junior. Speculation about Cohn&#x27;s sexuality intensified following his death from AIDS in 1986. In a 2008 article published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Jeffrey Toobin quotes Cohn associate Roger Stone: &quot;Roy was not gay. He was a man who liked having sex with men. Gays were weak, effeminate. He always seemed to have these young blond boys around. It just wasn&#x27;t discussed. He was interested in power and access.&quot;

=== Sexual blackmail allegations ===
Some of Cohn&#x27;s former clients, including Bill Bonanno, son of Joseph Bonanno, credit him with having compromising photographs of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Because Hoover knew the pictures existed, Cohn told Bonanno, Hoover feared being blackmailed. Other organized crime figures have corroborated these allegations.

== Reputation ==

In 1978, Ken Auletta wrote in an &quot;Esquire&quot; profile of Cohn: &quot;He fights his cases as if they were his own. It is war. If he feels his adversary has been unfair, it is war to the death. No white flags. No Mr. Nice Guy. Prospective clients who want to kill their husband, torture a business partner, break the government&#x27;s legs, hire Roy Cohn. He is a legal executioner—the toughest, meanest, loyalest, vilest, and one of the most brilliant lawyers in America.&quot;

Maureen Dowd wrote in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; which described Matt Tyrnauer&#x27;s film &quot;Where&#x27;s My Roy Cohn?&quot;: &quot;Roy Cohn understood the political value of wrapping himself in the flag. He made good copy. He knew how to manipulate the press and dictate stories to the New York tabloids. He surrounded himself with gorgeous women. There was always something of a nefarious nature going on. He was like a caged animal who would go after you the minute the cage door was opened.&quot;

Several people have asserted that Cohn had considerable influence on the presidency of Donald Trump. Ivy Meeropol, director of &quot;Bully, Coward, Victim: The Story of Roy Cohn&quot;, said &quot;Cohn really paved the way for Trump and set him up with the right people, introduced him to Paul Manafort and Roger Stone—the people who helped him get to the White House.&quot;

&quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Marie Brenner wrote in an article about Cohn&#x27;s mentorship of Trump: &quot;Cohn—possessed of a keen intellect... he could keep a jury spellbound. When he was indicted for bribery, in 1969, his lawyer suffered a heart attack near the end of the trial. Cohn deftly stepped in and did a seven-hour closing argument—never once referring to a notepad… When Cohn spoke, he would fix you with a hypnotic stare. His eyes were the palest blue, all the more startling because they appeared to protrude from the sides of his head. While Al Pacino&#x27;s version of Cohn (in Mike Nichols&#x27;s 2003 HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot;) captured Cohn&#x27;s intensity, it failed to convey his child-like yearning to be liked.&quot;

==Media portrayals==
=== Theatre ===
Cohn inspired several fictional portrayals after his death. Probably the best known is in Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Angels in America&quot; (1991), which portrays Cohn as a closeted, power-hungry hypocrite haunted by the ghost of Ethel Rosenberg as he denies dying of AIDS. In the initial Broadway production, the role was played by Ron Leibman; in the HBO miniseries (2003), Cohn is played by Al Pacino; and in the 2010 Off-Broadway revival by the Signature Theatre Company in Manhattan, the role was reprised by Frank Wood. Nathan Lane played Cohn in the 2017 Royal National Theatre production and the 2018 Broadway production. Cohn is also a character in Kushner&#x27;s one-act play, &quot;G. David Schine in Hell&quot; (1996). That play may have been inspired in part by the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; comic strip &quot;Roy Cohn in Hell&quot; (February 1987), which depicts Cohn joining Hoover and Senator McCarthy in the underworld. In the early 1990s, Cohn was one of two subjects of Ron Vawter&#x27;s one-man show &quot;Roy Cohn/Jack Smith&quot;; his part was written by Gary Indiana.

=== Cinema, music, and television ===
Cohn had been played numerous times on both film and television. Cinematic portrayals include the following: 
Cohn was the subject of two 2019 documentaries: &quot;Bully, Coward, Victim: The Story of Roy Cohn&quot;, directed by Ivy Meeropol (a documentary filmmaker and granddaughter of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg) and Matt Tyrnauer&#x27;s &quot;Where&#x27;s My Roy Cohn?&quot; David Moreland appears as Cohn in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Travelers&quot; (1998). Roland Blum, played by Michael Sheen, is a dishonest lawyer inspired by Cohn, who appears in &quot;The One Inspired by Roy Cohn&quot;, Season 3, Episode 2 of &quot;The Good Fight&quot;. Cohn is name checked in the Billy Joel song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;. &quot;The Apprentice&quot; is a 2024 independent biographical drama film that examines Trump&#x27;s career as a real estate businessman in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s, including his relationship with Roy Cohn portraying himself as Trump&#x27;s attorney and mentor; the film was nominated for two Academy Awards. The film explores their friendship while Cohn is shown leading an actively LGBT lifestyle in New York City while forming a closer business relationship with Trump.

<text>In music, groove is the sense of an effect (&quot;feel&quot;) of changing pattern in a propulsive rhythm or sense of &quot;swing&quot;. In jazz, it can be felt as a quality of persistently repeated rhythmic units, created by the interaction of the music played by a band&#x27;s rhythm section (e.g. drums, electric bass or double bass, guitar, and keyboards). Groove is a significant feature of popular music, and can be found in many genres, including salsa, rock, soul, funk, and fusion.

From a broader ethnomusicological perspective, groove has been described as &quot;an unspecifiable but ordered sense of something that is sustained in a distinctive, regular and attractive way, working to draw the listener in.&quot; Musicologists and other scholars have analyzed the concept of &quot;groove&quot; since around the 1990s. They have argued that a &quot;groove&quot; is an &quot;understanding of rhythmic patterning&quot; or &quot;feel&quot; and &quot;an intuitive sense&quot; of &quot;a cycle in motion&quot; that emerges from &quot;carefully aligned concurrent rhythmic patterns&quot; that stimulates dancing or foot-tapping on the part of listeners. The concept can be linked to the sorts of ostinatos that generally accompany fusions and dance musics of African derivation (e.g. African-American, Afro-Cuban, Afro-Brazilian, etc.).

The term is often applied to musical performances that make one want to move or dance, and enjoyably (a word that also has sexual connotations). The expression &quot;in the groove&quot; (as in the jazz standard) was widely used from around 1936 to 1945, at the height of the swing era, to describe top-notch jazz performances. In the 1940s and 1950s, groove commonly came to denote musical &quot;routine, preference, style, [or] source of pleasure.&quot;

==Description==

===Musicians&#x27; perspectives===

Like the term &quot;swing&quot;, which is used to describe a cohesive rhythmic &quot;feel&quot; in a jazz context, the concept of &quot;groove&quot; can be hard to define. Marc Sabatella&#x27;s article &quot;Establishing The Groove&quot; argues that &quot;groove is a completely subjective thing.&quot; He claims that &quot;one person may think a given drummer has a great feel, while another person may think the same drummer sounds too stiff, and another may think he is too loose.&quot; Similarly, a bass educator states that while &quot;groove is an elusive thing&quot; it can be defined as &quot;what makes the music breathe&quot; and the &quot;sense of motion in the context of a song&quot;.

In a musical context, general dictionaries define a groove as &quot;a pronounced, enjoyable rhythm&quot; or the act of &quot;creat[ing], danc[ing] to, or enjoy[ing] rhythmic music&quot;. Steve Van Telejuice explains the &quot;groove&quot; as the point in this sense when he defines it as a point in a song or performance when &quot;even the people who can&#x27;t dance wanna feel like dancing...&quot; due to the effect of the music.

Bernard Coquelet argues that the &quot;groove is the way an experienced musician will play a rhythm compared with the way it is written (or would be written)&quot; by playing slightly &quot;before or after the beat&quot;. Coquelet claims that the &quot;notion of groove actually has to do with aesthetics and style&quot;; &quot;groove is an artistic element, that is to say human...and &quot;it will evolve depending on the harmonic context, the place in the song, the sound of the musician&#x27;s instrument, and, in interaction with the groove of the other musicians&quot;, which he calls &quot;collective&quot; groove&quot;. Minute rhythmic variations by the rhythm section members such as the bass player can dramatically change the feel as a band plays a song, even for a simple singer-songwriter groove.

===Theoretical analysis===
UK musicologist Richard Middleton (1999) notes that while &quot;the concept of &quot;groove&quot;&quot; has &quot;long [been] familiar in musicians&#x27; own usage&quot;, musicologists and theorists have only more recently begun to analyze this concept. Middleton states that a groove &quot;... marks an understanding of rhythmic patterning that underlies its role in producing the characteristic rhythmic &#x27;feel&#x27; of a piece&quot;. He notes that the &quot;feel created by a repeating framework&quot; is also modified with variations. &quot;Groove&quot;, in terms of pattern-sequencing, is also known as &quot;shuffle note&quot;—where there is deviation from exact step positions.

When the musical slang phrase &quot;Being in the groove&quot; is applied to a group of improvisers, this has been called &quot;an advanced level of development for any improvisational music group&quot;, which is &quot;equivalent to Bohm and Jaworski&#x27;s descriptions of an evoked field&quot;, which systems dynamics scholars claim are &quot;forces of unseen connection that directly influence our experience and behaviour&quot;. Peter Forrester and John Bailey argue that the &quot;chances of achieving this higher level of playing&quot; (i.e., attain a &quot;groove&quot;) are improved when the musicians are &quot;open to other&#x27;s musical ideas&quot;, &quot;finding ways of complementing other participant&#x27;s musical ideas&quot;, and &quot;taking risks with the music&quot;.

Turry and Aigen cite Feld&#x27;s definition of groove as &quot;an intuitive sense of style as process, a perception of a cycle in motion, a form or organizing pattern being revealed, a recurrent clustering of elements through time&quot;. Aigen states that &quot;when [a] groove is established among players, the musical whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts, enabling a person [...] to experience something beyond himself which he[/she] cannot create alone (Aigen 2002, p.34)&quot;.

Jeff Pressing&#x27;s 2002 article claimed that a &quot;groove or feel&quot; is &quot;a cognitive temporal phenomenon emerging from one or more carefully aligned concurrent rhythmic patterns, characterized by...perception of recurring pulses, and subdivision of structure in such pulses...perception of a cycle of time, of length 2 or more pulses, enabling identification of cycle locations, and...effectiveness of engaging synchronizing body responses (e.g. dance, foot-tapping)&quot;.

===Neuroscientific perspectives===
The &quot;groove&quot; has been cited as an example of sensory-motor coupling between neural systems. Sensory-motor coupling is the coupling or integration of the sensory system and motor system. Sensorimotor integration is not a static process. For a given stimulus, there is no one single motor command. &quot;Neural responses at almost every stage of a sensorimotor pathway are modified at short and long timescales by biophysical and synaptic processes, recurrent and feedback connections, and learning, as well as many other internal and external variables&quot;. Recent research has shown that at least some styles of modern groove-oriented rock music are characterized by an &quot;aesthetics of exactitude&quot; and the strongest groove stimulation could be observed for drum patterns without microtiming deviations.

==Use in different genres==
===Jazz===
In some more traditional styles of jazz, the musicians often use the word &quot;swing&quot; to describe the sense of rhythmic cohesion of a skilled group. However, since the 1950s, musicians from the organ trio and latin jazz subgenres have also used the term &quot;groove&quot;. Jazz flute player Herbie Mann talks a lot about &quot;the groove.&quot; In the 1950s, Mann &quot;locked into a Brazilian groove in the early &#x27;60s, then moved into a funky, soulful groove in the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s. By the mid-&#x27;70s he was making hit disco records, still cooking in a rhythmic groove.&quot; He describes his approach to finding the groove as follows: &quot;All you have to do is find the waves that are comfortable to float on top of.&quot; Mann argues that the &quot;epitome of a groove record&quot; is &quot;&quot;Memphis Underground&quot; or &quot;Push Push&quot;&quot;, because the &quot;rhythm section [is] locked all in one perception.&quot;

In Jamaican reggae, dancehall, and dub music, the creole term &quot;riddim&quot; is used to describe the rhythm patterns created by the drum pattern or a prominent bassline. In other musical contexts a &quot;riddim&quot; would be called a &quot;groove&quot; or beat. One of the widely copied &quot;riddims&quot;, &quot;Real Rock&quot;, was recorded in 1967 by Sound Dimension. &quot;It was built around a single, emphatic bass note followed by a rapid succession of lighter notes. The pattern repeated over and over hypnotically. The sound was so powerful that it gave birth to an entire style of reggae meant for slow dancing called &quot;rub a dub.&quot;&quot;

===R&amp;B===
The &quot;groove&quot; is also associated with funk performers, such as James Brown&#x27;s drummers Clyde Stubblefield and Jabo Starks, and with soul music. &quot;In the 1950s, when &#x27;funk&#x27; and &#x27;funky&#x27; were used increasingly as adjectives in the context of soul music—the meaning being transformed from the original one of a pungent odor to a re-defined meaning of a strong, distinctive groove.&quot; As &quot;[t]he soul dance music of its day, the basic idea of funk was to create as intense a groove as possible.&quot;
When a drummer plays a groove that &quot;is very solid and with a great feel...&quot;, this is referred to informally as being &quot;in the pocket&quot;; when a drummer &quot;maintains this feel for an extended period of time, never wavering, this is often referred to as a deep pocket.&quot;

===Hip hop===
A concept similar to &quot;groove&quot; or &quot;swing&quot; is also used in other African-American genres such as hip hop. The rhythmic groove that jazz artists call a sense of “swing” is sometimes referred to as having &quot;flow&quot; in the hip hop scene. &quot;Flow is as elemental to hip hop as the concept of swing is to jazz&quot;. Just as the jazz concept of &quot;swing&quot; involves performers deliberately playing behind or ahead of the beat, the hip-hop concept of flow is about &quot;funking with one&#x27;s expectations of time&quot;—that is, the rhythm and pulse of the music. &quot;Flow is not about &quot;what&quot; is being said so much as &quot;how&quot; one is saying it&quot;.

===Groove metal===

In the 1990s the term &quot;groove&quot; was used to describe a form of thrash metal called groove metal, which is based around the use of mid-tempo thrash riffs and detuned power chords played with heavy syncopation. &quot;Speed wasn’t the main point anymore, it was what Pantera singer Phil Anselmo called the &#x27;power groove.&#x27; Riffs became unusually heavy without the need of growling or the extremely distorted guitars of death metal, rhythms depended more on a heavy groove.&quot;

With heavy metal, the term &quot;groove&quot; can also be associated with stoner metal, sludge metal, doom metal and death metal genres as well as djent.

<text>The Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia) is a species of tern, with a subcosmopolitan but scattered distribution. Despite its extensive range, it is monotypic of its genus, and has no accepted subspecies. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;hudros&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, and Latin &quot;progne&quot;, &quot;swallow&quot;. The specific &quot;caspia&quot; is from Latin and, like the English name, refers to the Caspian Sea.

==Description==
It is the world&#x27;s largest tern with a length of , a wingspan of and a weight of . Adult birds have black legs, and a long thick red-orange bill with a small black tip. They have a white head with a black cap and white neck, belly, and tail. The upper wings and back are pale grey; the underwings are pale with dark primary feathers. In-flight, the tail is less forked than other terns, and wingtips are black on the underside. In winter, the black cap is still present (unlike many other terns), but with some white streaking on the forehead. The call is a loud heron-like croak.
==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is large lakes and ocean coasts in North America (including the Great Lakes), and locally in Europe (mainly around the Baltic Sea and Black Sea), Asia, Africa, and Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). North American birds migrate to southern coasts, the West Indies and northernmost South America. European and Asian birds spend the non-breeding season in the Old World tropics. African and Australasian birds are resident or disperse over short distances.

In 2016, a nest of the Caspian tern was found in the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in northwestern Alaska, 1,000 miles further north than any previous sighting. This development was part of a general trend in Alaska of species moving to the north, a tendency ascribed to global warming.

The global population is about 50,000 pairs; numbers in most regions are stable, but the Baltic Sea population (1400–1475 pairs in the early 1990s) is declining and of conservation concern.

The Caspian tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
They feed mainly on fish, which they dive for, hovering high over the water and then plunging. They also occasionally eat large insects, the young and eggs of other birds and rodents. They may fly up to from the breeding colony to catch fish; they often fish on freshwater lakes as well as at sea.

===Breeding===

Breeding is in spring and summer, with one to three pale blue-green eggs, with heavy brown spotting, being laid. They nest either together in colonies, or singly in mixed colonies of other tern and gull species. The nest is on the ground among gravel and sand, or sometimes on vegetation; incubation lasts for 26–28 days. The chicks are variable in plumage pattern, from pale creamy to darker grey-brown; this variation assists adults in recognizing their own chicks when returning to the colony from feeding trips. Fledging occurs after 35–45 days.

<text>Body fluids, bodily fluids, or biofluids, sometimes body liquids, are liquids within the body of an organism. In lean healthy adult men, the total body water is about 60% (60–67%) of the total body weight; it is usually slightly lower in women (52–55%). The exact percentage of fluid relative to body weight is inversely proportional to the percentage of body fat. A lean man, for example, has about 42 (42–47) liters of water in his body.

The total body of water is divided into fluid compartments, between the intracellular fluid compartment (also called space, or volume) and the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment (space, volume) in a two-to-one ratio: 28 (28–32) liters are inside cells and 14 (14–15) liters are outside cells.

The ECF compartment is divided into the interstitial fluid volume – the fluid outside both the cells and the blood vessels – and the intravascular volume (also called the vascular volume and blood plasma volume) – the fluid inside the blood vessels – in a three-to-one ratio: the interstitial fluid volume is about 12 liters; the vascular volume is about 4 liters.

The interstitial fluid compartment is divided into the lymphatic fluid compartment – about 2/3, or 8 (6–10) liters, and the transcellular fluid compartment (the remaining 1/3, or about 4 liters).

The vascular volume is divided into the venous volume and the arterial volume; and the arterial volume has a conceptually useful but unmeasurable subcompartment called the effective arterial blood volume.

==Compartments by location==
* intracellular fluid (ICF), which consist of cytosol and fluids in the cell nucleus
* Extracellular fluid
** Intravascular fluid (blood plasma)
** Interstitial fluid
** Lymphatic fluid (sometimes included in interstitial fluid)
** Transcellular fluid

==Health==
===Clinical samples===
Clinical samples are generally defined as non-infectious human or animal materials including blood, saliva, excreta, body tissue and tissue fluids, and also FDA-approved pharmaceuticals that are blood products. In medical contexts, it is a specimen taken for diagnostic examination or evaluation, and for identification of disease or condition.

<text>Scott Monroe Sterling (March 2, 1962 – August 27, 1987), known by the stage name DJ Scott La Rock, was an American hip-hop disc jockey and music producer from the Bronx, New York. He was a founding member of the East Coast hip hop group Boogie Down Productions. He was also known for his association with the rapper KRS-One who was a member of Boogie Down Productions. 

Sterling&#x27;s death in August 1987 is said to be the first murder of a major hip hop artist.

== Early life ==

Scott Sterling was born on March 2, 1962, in the Bronx, New York City. His parents separated when he was four years old, so he was raised by his mother, Carolyn Morant, a municipal employee. They moved from Queens, New York City, to the Bronx: first Morrisania and then Morris Heights.

He excelled in both academics and sports at Our Saviour Lutheran High School, graduating in 1980. He attended Castleton State College in Vermont and earned a varsity letter in basketball there.

== Career ==
La Rock returned to New York City in hopes of finding work and making inroads in the music industry. Through a connection of his mother&#x27;s, La Rock landed a job as a social worker at Franklin Armory Men&#x27;s Shelter on 166th Street in the Bronx. At night, though, he spun records at the hip hop hot spot the Broadway Repertoire Theatre.

During his time as a social worker, La Rock met rapper KRS-One in 1986 at Franklin Men&#x27;s Shelter where KRS resided. The pair formed Boogie Down Productions (BDP) with DJ Derrick &quot;D-Nice&quot; Jones, a cousin of the shelter&#x27;s security guard, Floyd Payne. The group&#x27;s 1987 debut album, &quot;Criminal Minded&quot;, is considered a hip hop classic.

== Murder ==
On August 27, 1987, D-Nice was assaulted by men upset that he had been talking to one of their ex-girlfriends. D-Nice asked La Rock to help defuse the situation. Later that day, La Rock, Scotty &quot;Manager Moe&quot; Morris, DJ McBooo, D-Nice and BDP bodyguard Darrell rode a Jeep CJ-7 to the Highbridge Homes Projects building on University Avenue in the South Bronx. As they were leaving, bullets were fired through the side and top of the Jeep. La Rock struck his head on the dashboard, not realizing at the time he had been struck by a bullet in the back of his head. He was driven to Lincoln Hospital. He was conscious as he was wheeled into the emergency department, telling doctors he was feeling cold and tired. After lifesaving efforts failed, he was declared brain dead, and his mother later made the decision to terminate life support and donate his organs.

Two men were arrested and charged with La Rock&#x27;s murder, but they were acquitted at trial. He left behind an infant son.

<text>In ecclesiology, the Christian Church is what different Christian denominations conceive of as being the true body of Christians or the original institution established by Jesus Christ. &quot;Christian Church&quot; has also been used in academia as a synonym for Christianity, despite the fact that it is composed of multiple churches or denominations, many of which hold a doctrinal claim of being the one true church to the exclusion of the others.

For many Protestant Christians, the Christian Church has two components: the church visible, institutions in which &quot;the Word of God purely preached and listened to, and the sacraments administered according to Christ&#x27;s institution&quot;, as well as the church invisible—all &quot;who are truly saved&quot; (with these beings members of the visible church). In this understanding of the invisible church, &quot;Christian Church&quot; (or catholic Church) does not refer to a particular Christian denomination, but includes all individuals who have been saved. The branch theory, which is maintained by some Anglicans, holds that those Churches that have preserved apostolic succession are part of the true Church. This is in contrast to the one true church applied to a specific concrete Christian institution, a Christian ecclesiological position maintained by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, Assyrian Church of the East, and the Ancient Church of the East.

Most English translations of the New Testament generally use the word &quot;church&quot; as a translation of the Ancient Greek &quot;ἐκκλησία&quot; (romanized &quot;ecclesia&quot;), found in the original Greek texts, which generally meant an &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;congregation&quot;. This term appears in two verses of the Gospel of Matthew, 24 verses of the Acts of the Apostles, 58 verses of the Pauline epistles (including the earliest instances of its use in relation to a Christian body), two verses of the Letter to the Hebrews, one verse of the Epistle of James, three verses of the Third Epistle of John, and 19 verses of the Book of Revelation. In total, &quot;ἐκκλησία&quot; appears 114 times in the New Testament, although not every instance is a technical reference to the church. As such it is used for local communities as well as in a universal sense to mean all believers. The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; () was by Ignatius of Antioch, in around 100 AD.

The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed (381) are that the Church is one, holy, catholic (universal), and apostolic (originating from the apostles).

==Etymology==
The Greek word &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;called out&quot; or &quot;called forth&quot; and commonly used to indicate a group of individuals called to gather for some function, in particular an assembly of the citizens of a city, as in , is the New Testament term referring to the Christian Church (either a particular local group or the whole body of the faithful). In the Septuagint, the Greek word &quot;ἐκκλησία&quot; is used to translate the Hebrew &quot;קהל&quot; (qahal). Most Romance and Celtic languages use derivations of this word, either inherited or borrowed from the Latin form &quot;ecclesia&quot;.

The English language word &quot;church&quot; is from the Old English word &quot;cirice&quot; or &quot;Circe&quot;, derived from West Germanic &quot;*kirika&quot;, which in turn comes from the Greek &quot;kuriakē&quot;, meaning &quot;of the Lord&quot; (possessive form of &quot;kurios&quot; &quot;ruler&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;). &quot;Kuriakē&quot; in the sense of &quot;church&quot; is most likely a shortening of &quot;kuriakē oikia&quot; (&quot;house of the Lord&quot;) or &quot;ekklēsia kuriakē&quot; (&quot;congregation of the Lord&quot;). Christian churches were sometimes called &quot;kuriakon&quot; (adjective meaning &quot;of the Lord&quot;) in Greek starting in the 4th century, but &quot;ekklēsia&quot; and &quot;basilikē&quot; were more common.

The word is one of many direct Greek-to-Germanic loans of Christian terminology, via the Goths. The Slavic terms for &quot;church&quot; (Old Church Slavonic [&quot;crĭky&quot;], Bulgarian [&quot;carkva&quot;], Russian [&quot;cerkov&quot;&#x27;], Slovenian cerkev) are via the Old High German cognate .

==History==

The Christian Church originated in Roman Judea in the first century AD/CE, founded on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, who first gathered disciples. Those disciples later became known as &quot;Christians&quot;; according to Scripture, Jesus commanded them to spread his teachings to all the world. For most Christians, the holiday of Pentecost (an event that occurred after Jesus&#x27; ascension to Heaven) represents the birthday of the Church, signified by the descent of the Holy Spirit on gathered disciples.

Springing out of Second Temple Judaism, from Christianity&#x27;s earliest days, Christians accepted non-Jews (Gentiles) without requiring full adoption of Jewish customs (such as circumcision). The parallels in the Jewish faith are the Proselytes, Godfearers, and Noahide Law; see also Biblical law in Christianity. Some think that conflict with Jewish religious authorities quickly led to the expulsion of Christians from the synagogues in Jerusalem.

The Church gradually spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, gaining major establishments in cities such as Jerusalem, Antioch, and Edessa. The Roman authorities persecuted it because Christians refused to make sacrifice to the Roman gods, and challenged the imperial cult. The Church was legalized in the Roman empire, and then promoted by Emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I in the 4th century as the State Church of the Roman Empire.

Already in the 2nd century, Christians denounced teachings that they saw as heresies, especially Gnosticism but also Montanism. Ignatius of Antioch at the beginning of that century and Irenaeus at the end saw union with the bishops as the test of correct Christian faith. After legalization of the Church in the 4th century, the debate between Arianism and Trinitarianism, with the emperors favouring now one side now the other, was a major controversy.

===Use by early Christians===
In using the word ἐκκλησία (&quot;ekklēsia&quot;), early Christians were employing a term that, while it designated the assembly of a Greek city-state, in which only citizens could participate, was traditionally used by Greek-speaking Jews to speak of Israel, the people of God, and that appeared in the Septuagint in the sense of an assembly gathered for religious reasons, often for a liturgy; in that translation ἐκκλησία stood for the Hebrew word קהל (&quot;qahal&quot;), which however it also rendered as συναγωγή (&quot;synagōgē&quot;, &quot;synagogue&quot;), the two Greek words being largely synonymous until Christians distinguished them more clearly.

The term ἐκκλησία appears in only two verses of the Gospels, in both cases in the Gospel of Matthew. When Jesus says to Simon Peter, &quot;You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church&quot;, the church is the community instituted by Christ, but in the other passage the church is the local community to which one belongs: &quot;If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church.&quot;

The term is used much more frequently in other parts of the New Testament, designating, as in the Gospel of Matthew, either an individual local community or all of them collectively. Even passages that do not use the term ἐκκλησία may refer to the church with other expressions, as in the first 14 chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, in which ἐκκλησία is totally absent but which repeatedly uses the cognate word κλήτοι (&quot;klētoi&quot;, &quot;called&quot;). The church may be referred to also through images traditionally employed in the Bible to speak of the people of God, such as the image of the vineyard used particularly in the Gospel of John.

The New Testament never uses the adjectives &quot;catholic&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; with reference to the Christian Church, but does indicate that the local communities are one church, collectively, that Christians must always seek to be in concord, as the Congregation of God, that the Gospel must extend to the ends of the earth and to all nations, that the church is open to all peoples and must not be divided, etc.

The first recorded application of &quot;catholic&quot; or &quot;universal&quot; to the church is by Ignatius of Antioch in about 107 in his Epistle to the Smyrnaeans, chapter VIII: &quot;Wherever the bishop appears, there let the people be; as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.&quot;

===Christianity as Roman state religion===
On February 27, 380, the Roman Empire officially adopted the Nicene version of Christianity as its state religion. Prior to this date, Constantius II (337–361) and Valens (364–378) had personally favored Arian or Semi-Arian forms of Christianity, but Valens&#x27; successor Theodosius I supported the more Athanasian or Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the Nicene Creed from the 1st Council of Nicaea.j

On this date, Theodosius I decreed that only the followers of Trinitarian Christianity were entitled to be referred to as Catholic Christians, while all others were to be considered to be heretics, which was considered illegal. In 385, this new legal situation resulted, in the first case of many to come, in the capital punishment of a heretic, namely Priscillian, condemned to death, with several of his followers, by a civil tribunal for the crime of magic. In the centuries of state-sponsored Christianity that followed, pagans and heretical Christians were routinely persecuted by the Empire and the many kingdoms and countries that later occupied its place, but some Germanic tribes remained Arian well into the Middle Ages (see also Christendom).

The Church within the Roman Empire was organized under metropolitan sees, with five rising to particular prominence and forming the basis for the Pentarchy proposed by Justinian I. Of these five, one was in the West (Rome) and the rest in the East (Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria).

Even after the split of the Roman Empire the Church remained a relatively united institution (apart from Oriental Orthodoxy and some other groups which separated from the rest of the state-sanctioned Church earlier). The Church came to be a central and defining institution of the Empire, especially in the East or Byzantine Empire, where Constantinople came to be seen as the center of the Christian world, owing in great part to its economic and political power.

Once the Western Empire fell to Germanic incursions in the 5th century, the (Roman) Church became for centuries the primary link to Roman civilization for medieval Western Europe and an important channel of influence in the West for the Eastern Roman, or &quot;Byzantine&quot;, emperors. While, in the West, the so-called orthodox Church competed against the Arian Christian and pagan faiths of the Germanic rulers and spread outside what had been the Empire to Ireland, Germany, Scandinavia, and the western Slavs, in the East Christianity spread to the Slavs in what is now Russia, south-central and eastern Europe.

Starting in the 7th century, the Islamic Caliphates rose and gradually began to conquer larger and larger areas of the Christian world. Excepting North Africa and most of Spain, northern and western Europe escaped largely unscathed by Islamic expansion, in great part because richer Constantinople and its empire acted as a magnet for the onslaught. The challenge presented by the Muslims would help to solidify the religious identity of eastern Christians even as it gradually weakened the Eastern Empire. Even in the Muslim World, the Church survived (e.g., the modern Copts, Maronites, and others) albeit at times with great difficulty.

===Great Schism of 1054===
Although there had long been frictions between the Bishop of Rome (i.e., the patriarch of the Catholic Church proper) and the eastern patriarchs within the Byzantine Empire, Rome&#x27;s changing allegiance from Constantinople to the Frankish king Charlemagne set the Church on a course towards separation. The political and theological divisions would grow until Rome and the East excommunicated each other in the 11th century, ultimately leading to the division of the Church into the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) churches. In 1448, not long before the Byzantine Empire collapsed, the Russian Orthodox Church gained independence from the Patriarch of Constantinople.

As a result of the redevelopment of Western Europe, and the gradual fall of the Eastern Roman Empire to the Arabs and Turks (helped by warfare against Eastern Christians), the final Fall of Constantinople in 1453 resulted in Eastern scholars fleeing to the West bringing ancient manuscripts, which was a factor in the beginning of the period of the Western Renaissance there. Rome was seen by the Western Church as Christianity&#x27;s heartland. Some Eastern churches even broke with Eastern Orthodoxy and entered into communion with Rome (the &quot;Uniate&quot; Eastern Catholic Churches).

===Protestant Reformation===
The changes brought on by the Renaissance eventually led to the Protestant Reformation during which the Protestant Lutheran and the Reformed followers of Calvin, Hus, Zwingli, Melancthon, Knox, and others split from the Catholic Church. At this time, a series of non-theological disputes also led to the English Reformation which led to the independence of the Church of England. Then, during the Age of Exploration and the Age of Imperialism, Western Europe spread the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches around the world, especially in the Americas. These developments in turn have led to Christianity being the largest religion in the world today.

==Catholic tradition==

The Catholic Church teaches in its doctrine that it is the original church founded by Christ on the Apostles in the 1st century AD.

The encyclical of Pope Pius IX, &quot;Singulari Quidem&quot;, states: &quot;There is only one true, holy, Catholic Church, which is the Apostolic Roman Church. There is only one See founded on Peter by the word of the Lord [...] Outside of the Church, no one can hope for life or salvation unless he is excused through ignorance beyond his control.&quot; 

The papal encyclical &quot;Mystici corporis&quot; (Pope Pius XII, 1943), expresses the dogmatic ecclesiology of the Catholic Church thus: &quot;If we would define and describe this true Church of Jesus Christ—which is the One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman Church–we shall find no expression more noble, more sublime, or more divine, than the phrase which calls it &#x27;the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ&#x27;.&quot; The Second Vatican Council&#x27;s dogmatic constitution, &quot;Lumen gentium&quot; (1964), further declares that &quot;the one Church of Christ which in the Creed is professed as one, holy, catholic and apostolic, [...] constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him&quot;.

A 2007 declaration of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith clarified that, in this passage, &quot;&#x27;subsistence&#x27; means this perduring, historical continuity and the permanence of all the elements instituted by Christ in the Catholic Church, in which the Church of Christ is concretely found on this earth&quot;, and acknowledged that grace can be operative within religious communities separated from the Catholic Church due to some &quot;elements of sanctification and truth&quot; within them, but also added &quot;Nevertheless, the word &#x27;subsists&#x27; can only be attributed to the Catholic Church alone precisely because it refers to the mark of unity that we profess in the symbols of the faith (I believe... in the &#x27;one&#x27; Church); and this &#x27;one&#x27; Church subsists in the Catholic Church.&quot;

The Catholic Church teaches that only corporate bodies of Christians led by bishops with valid holy orders can be recognized as &quot;churches&quot; in the proper sense. In Catholic documents, communities without such bishops are formally called ecclesial communities.

==Eastern Orthodox tradition==
The Eastern Orthodox Church claims to be the original Christian Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church bases its claim primarily on its assertion that it holds to traditions and beliefs of the original Christian Church. It also claims that four out of the five sees of the Pentarchy (excluding Rome) are still a part of it.

== Oriental Orthodox tradition==
The Oriental Orthodox Churches claims to be the original Christian Church. The Oriental Orthodox churches&#x27; bases their claim primarily on its assertion that it holds to traditions and beliefs of the original Christian Church. They never adopted the theory of the Nature of God, which was formulated later than the break that followed the Council of Chalcedon.

==Lutheran tradition==

The Lutheran churches traditionally hold that their tradition represents the true visible Church. The Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that &quot;the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church&quot;. When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have &quot;showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils&quot;.

Nevertheless, the Lutheran churches teach that &quot;there are indeed true Christians in other churches&quot; as &quot;other denominations also preach the Word of God, though mixed with error&quot;; since the proclamation of the Word of God bears fruit, Lutheran theology accepts the appellation &quot;Church&quot; for other Christian denominations.

==Anglican tradition==
Anglicans generally understand their tradition as a branch of the historical &quot;Catholic Church&quot; and as a &quot;via media&quot; (&quot;middle way&quot;) between traditions, often Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity, or Roman Catholicism and Reformed Christianity.

==Reformed tradition==
Reformed theology defines the Church as being invisible and visible—the former includes the entire communion of saints and the latter is the &quot;institution that God provides as an agency for God&#x27;s saving, justifying, and sustaining activity&quot;, which John Calvin referred to as &quot;our mother&quot;. The Reformed confessions of faith emphasize &quot;the pure teaching of the gospel (&quot;pura doctrina evangelii&quot;) and the right administration of the sacraments (&quot;recta administratio sacramentorum&quot;)&quot; as &quot;the two most necessary signs of the true visible church&quot;.

==Methodist tradition==

Methodists affirm belief in &quot;the one true Church, Apostolic and Universal&quot;, viewing their churches as constituting a &quot;privileged branch of this true church&quot;. With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom, the founder of the movement &quot;John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God. As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained.&quot; Calling it &quot;the grand depositum&quot; of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world.

==Baptist tradition==
Many Baptists, who uphold the doctrine of Baptist successionism (also known as Landmarkism), &quot;argue that their history can be traced across the centuries to New Testament times&quot; and &quot;claim that Baptists have represented the true church&quot; that &quot;has been, present in every period of history&quot;. Walter B. Shurden, the founding executive director of the Center for Baptist Studies at Mercer University, writes that the theology of Landmarkism, which he states is integral of the history of the Southern Baptist Convention, upholds the ideas that &quot;Only Baptist churches can trace their lineage in uninterrupted fashion back to the New Testament, and only Baptist churches therefore are true churches.&quot; In addition Shurden writes that Baptists who uphold successionism believe that &quot;only a true church-that is, a Baptist church-can legitimately celebrate the ordinances of baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Any celebration of these ordinances by non-Baptists is invalid.&quot;

Other Baptists do not adhere to Landmarkism and thus hold a broader understanding of what constitutes the true Christian Church, e.g. the American Baptist Churches (which are maintain ecumenical relations with other Churches).

==Pentecostal tradition==
In Pentecostalism, &quot;ecclesiology as seen through his concept of networks, where the Holy Spirit creates an openness in mission which allows for coordinated effort towards church planting and growth.&quot;

==Divisions and controversies==
Today there is a wide diversity of Christian groups, with a variety of different doctrines and traditions. These controversies between the various branches of Christianity naturally include significant differences in their respective ecclesiologies.

===Christian denominations===

&quot;Denomination&quot; is a generic term for a distinct Christian body identified by traits such as a common name, structure, leadership, or doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as &quot;church&quot; or &quot;fellowship&quot;. Divisions between one group and another are defined by doctrine and church authority; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy often separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are known as branches of Christianity.

Individual Christian denominations vary widely in the degree to which they recognize one another. Several claim to be the direct and sole authentic successor the church founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century AD. Others, however, believe in denominationalism, where some or all Christian denominations are legitimate churches of the same religion regardless of their distinguishing labels, beliefs, and practices. Because of this concept, some Christian bodies reject the term &quot;denomination&quot; to describe themselves, to avoid implying equivalency with other churches or denominations.

The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church believe that the term &quot;one&quot; in the Nicene Creed describes and prescribes a &quot;visible&quot; institutional and doctrinal unity, not only geographically throughout the world, but also historically throughout history. They see unity as one of the four marks that the Creed attributes to the genuine Church, and the essence of a mark is to be visible. A church whose identity and belief varied from country to country and from age to age would not be &quot;one&quot; in their estimation. As such they see themselves not as a denomination, but as pre-denominational; not as one of many faith communities, but the original and sole true Church.
Many Baptist and Congregationalist theologians accept the local sense as the only valid application of the term &quot;church&quot;. They strongly reject the notion of a universal (catholic) church. These denominations argue that all uses of the Greek word &quot;ekklesia&quot; in the New Testament are speaking of either a particular local group or of the notion of &quot;church&quot; in the abstract, and never of a single, worldwide Church.

Many Anglicans, Lutherans, Old Catholics, and Independent Catholics view unity as a mark of catholicity, but see the institutional unity of the Catholic Church as manifested in the shared apostolic succession of their episcopacies, rather than a shared episcopal hierarchy or rites.

Reformed Christians hold that every person justified by faith in the Gospel committed to the Apostles is a member of &quot;One, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church&quot;. From this perspective, the real unity and holiness of the whole church established through the Apostles is yet to be revealed; and meanwhile, the extent and peace of the church on earth is imperfectly realized in a visible way.

The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod declares that the Christian Church, properly speaking, consists only of those who have faith in the gospel (i.e., the forgiveness of sins which Christ gained for all people), even if they are in church bodies that teach error, but excluding those who do not have such faith, even if they belong to a church or hold a teaching office in it.

===World Christianity===

A number of historians have noted a twentieth-century &quot;global shift&quot; in Christianity, from a religion largely found in Europe and the Americas to one which is found in the global south. Described as &quot;World Christianity&quot; or &quot;Global Christianity&quot;, this term attempts to convey the global nature of the Christian religion. However, the term often focuses on &quot;non-Western Christianity&quot; which &quot;comprises (usually the exotic) instances of Christian faith in &#x27;the global South&#x27;, in Asia, Africa and Latin America.&quot; It also includes indigenous or diasporic forms in Western Europe and North America.

<text>James Kirkwood Jr. (August 22, 1924 – April 21, 1989) was an American playwright, author and actor. In 1976 he received the Tony Award, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the Broadway hit &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;.

==Biography==
Kirkwood was born in Los Angeles. His father James Kirkwood Sr. was an actor and director in silent films, and his mother was actress Lila Lee. He had a half sister Joan Mary Kirkwood Thompson. After their divorce, he spent much of his time with his mother&#x27;s family in Elyria, Ohio, where he graduated from high school.

===Career===
From 1953 to 1957, he played Mickey Emerson on the soap opera &quot;Valiant Lady&quot;. Kirkwood wrote the semi-autobiographical novel &quot;There Must Be a Pony&quot;, made into a television film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Wagner. Other novels include &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot; (adapted into a play of the same name, which was, in turn, adapted into a film by Steve Guttenberg), &quot;Good Times/Bad Times&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Hero&quot;, and &quot;Hit Me with a Rainbow&quot;.

In 1959, Kirkwood appeared on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Johnny Baylor, son of Sen. Harriman Baylor, in &quot;The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll.&quot;

In 1970, Simon &amp; Schuster published Kirkwood&#x27;s &quot;American Grotesque&quot; about the trial of Clay Shaw. Shaw, a New Orleans businessman, was tried by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison on charges that he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate United States President John F. Kennedy and later acquitted. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote that &quot;Kirkwood&#x27;s portrait of Shaw as St. Sebastian is overdone to the point of self defeat&quot; and that &quot;the book does clinch the impression that legal grounds for the conspiracy charges were insufficient.&quot;

Kirkwood won the 1976 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama with collaborator Nicholas Dante for &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;.

Kirkwood also wrote the comedic play &quot;Legends!&quot; which toured the United States with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in 1987. The plot concerns a producer with a sure-fire commercial script, but no credibility, who lures two out-of-work but long-time feuding actresses &quot;of a certain age&quot; to star in his putative Broadway production. &quot;Legends!&quot; was the most financially successful road production of that season, but when producers insisted on cutting an important speech about breast cancer by Mary Martin&#x27;s character, the actress declared she would complete her contractual obligation, but would not open the play on Broadway, and the show closed on the road. Kirkwood wrote a book about the production of &quot;Legends!&quot; titled &quot;Diary of a Mad Playwright: Perilous Adventures on the Road with Mary Martin and Carol Channing&quot;.

A revival of &quot;Legends!&quot; was mounted with Joan Collins and Linda Evans of &quot;Dynasty&quot; fame. It toured more than 30 cities in the United States and Canada beginning in autumn 2006, but did not appear on Broadway as had been planned.

===Personal life===
In 1968, Kirkwood signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War (his novel &quot;Some Kind of Hero&quot; is centered on a prisoner of war in, and back home from, Vietnam).

Kirkwood died in his Manhattan apartment of AIDS-related complications in 1989.

===Literary prize===
In Kirkwood&#x27;s memory, his friends and admirers established the James Kirkwood Literary Prize to honor new generations of fiction writers for their literary achievements. The competition is hosted by the UCLA Extension Writers&#x27; Program, and the winner is determined by Andrew Morse, the prize&#x27;s benefactor.

<doc id="320772" wikidata="Q1091508" url="?curid=320772" title="Led Zeppelin DVD">
<text>Led Zeppelin DVD/VHS is a double DVD (or VHS) set by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released in the United Kingdom on 26 May 2003, and the United States on 27 May 2003. It contains live concert footage of the band spanning the years 1969 to 1979. The release includes the performance filmed by Stanley Dorfman and Peter Whitehead at the Royal Albert Hall on 9 January 1970, and performances at Madison Square Garden in 1973, Earls Court in 1975, and Knebworth in 1979, plus other footage. Bootleg footage from some of the concerts is interspersed with the professionally shot material.

The front cover features West and East Mitten Buttes, photographed from the visitor centre at the Navajo Tribal Park located at Monument Valley, Arizona.

==Background and production==
Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer of the project, Jimmy Page, commenced work on the project in the early 2000s. While fans had been trading poor quality versions of Led Zeppelin video material for years, this was the first official archival video release to contain any footage of the band playing live (outside of the cinematic, and later DVD release of The Song Remains the Same film). In an interview he gave after the release of the DVD, Page explained the impetus behind the project:

The reason for [the DVD] was that there was no visual material [of the band] that was out there really. The studio albums had been put out in many different shapes and forms, but this was something that was sorely missing because [Led] Zeppelin built its material on live performances. So that had to be done.

The idea for a live chronology had, however, dated back some time before this, according to singer Robert Plant in 2003:

The idea of creating a Led Zeppelin collage has been in the works for ... fifteen years. We just didn&#x27;t really have the time to put it together as a project because there was so much concentrated work that was required. So, as we all finished our individual projects, Jimmy Page took the helm along with some technical guys and this is what we&#x27;ve got.

In 1970, Led Zeppelin commissioned the British director and Producer of BBC&#x27;s music television series In Concert, Stanley Dorfman, to film the band&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; performance on January 9. Dorfman and the two cameramen he hired, Peter Whitehead and an assistant, used handheld Bolex cameras to capture the concert in 16mm film. In late January, the Record Mirror reported that the &quot;Led Zeppelin TV spectacular&quot; had been sold to American TV and a special album would be issued to coincide with the screening of the show in the States. 

Much later, the band&#x27;s manager at the time, Peter Grant, claimed that a 40-minute cut was prepared but was not officially released at the time because the footage was filmed at the wrong speed. However, at an expert panel held at The Royal Albert Hall on 27 May 2017 featuring the Hall&#x27;s historian Richard Dacre and Professor Steve Chibnall, of De Montfort University&#x27;s Cinema and Television History Research Centre, Chibnall explained, &quot;in the concert Led Zeppelin supplied a pulse feed off their mixing desk for the editing purposes but were not sufficiently happy with their performance to release the full soundtrack for use in the film.&quot; Chibnall stated that it was agreed with Stanley Dorfman that the concert would form part of a larger documentary project including the band&#x27;s performance at the Bath Festival in June, but that the project was shelved as Peter Whitehead, who had planned to film the band arriving to the Bath festival by helicopter, arrived at the venue too late to capture it on film, and only shot 20 or 30 minutes of footage from the festival. Additionally, Whitehead was supposed to do interviews with the band members, which reportedly never happened, and so the entire project was shelved. According to Professor Chinball, the footage ended up as a bootleg video in Japan in the 1980s after Whitehead loaned it to Peter Clifton who had directed the Zeppelin documentary &#x27;&quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;&#x27; a few years prior in 1976.

Clifton went on to say that in 1995, Whitehead attempted to get a film released of the Royal Albert Hall and Bath footage and sold it to Mark Hayward of UFO Films, who entered into negotiations with Led Zeppelin. In 2003, virtually all the Royal Albert Hall concert footage was released as Disk One of the &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD.&quot; After the DVD release, Jimmy Page explained, &quot;We had recorded and documented via 16mm a performance back in 1970 [at] the Royal Albert Hall. And there was quite a number of disputes over copyright of this material, and in the end it was sold to somebody who acquired it from one of the cameramen. And it was going to be auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s and, in actual fact, at the end of the day, we managed to do a deal with the chap [in 1997] to get it back, even though one of the reels managed to go missing! But ... you&#x27;ll understand why it was so important to have this, because there was such precious little Zeppelin [filmed] material.&quot; 

For the DVD, Page collaborated with music producer Kevin Shirley, with whom Page worked when he was performing with The Black Crowes. Shirley recalled:

I produced the Black Crowes, and Jimmy joined them for a run of live dates in 1999. I saw the show in New York, and then I went to California and recorded the shows, took the tapes away, and fixed them up a little and mixed them. I did &quot;Live at the Greek&quot; without any input from anyone, as it wasn&#x27;t originally going to be an official release. But I think everyone was impressed with it; certainly Jimmy said he was. Then, when Jimmy decided to do a new [Led Zeppelin] DVD, he started looking for someone familiar with the modern applications necessary for surround sound mixing. If you listen to the Royal Albert Hall [concert] opening in 5.1, you can see Jimmy had this audio concept really early on of giving people a sense of the band going onstage and the audience swells around you. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements needed for the DVD project audio, and afterward, he asked if I would be interested in &#x27;helping&#x27; him.

Page, with Shirley and the producer and creative director Dick Carruthers, worked for the best part of a year to research, compile, load, mix and present the material. Much of the footage which was included on the DVD was painstakingly restored for several months, before being mixed at Sarm West Studios in London. In all, 132 cans of film and two sets of two-inch video tape were examined for the project. In order to view material on the two-inch Quadruplex videotapes, a suitable playback machine had to be located. A working Quadruplex machine was finally found in Singapore.

Some of the video tapes suffered from a common fault called sticky-shed syndrome where the bonding agent holding the magnetic particles to the tape backing decomposes to the point where the oxide is scraped off during playback. The tapes consequently had to be restored by baking them in ovens at 55 °C (131 °F) for three weeks in order for them to be played back. The audio portions were digitally remixed for stereo and 5.1 surround mixes.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release the DVD received critical acclaim. Michael Azerrad of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine gave the DVD a perfect four stars, describing it as the &quot;Holy Grail of heavy metal&quot; and &quot;one of the best rock documentaries ever made&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The RIAA certified &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; at 13 times multi-platinum (1,300,000 copies sold in the United States). According to the BBC, the DVD broke all sales records for a music video, nearly three times as many in the first week of sales as the previous record holder. It was, for three years, the highest selling music DVD in the United States.

<doc id="320774" wikidata="Q1198056" url="?curid=320774" title="Johnnie Ray">
<text>John Alvin Ray (January 10, 1927 – February 24, 1990) was an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. Highly popular for most of the 1950s, Ray has been cited by critics as a major precursor to what became rock and roll, for his jazz and blues-influenced music, and his animated stage personality. Tony Bennett called Ray the &quot;father of rock and roll&quot;, and historians have noted him as a pioneering figure in the development of the genre.
Born and raised in Dallas, Oregon, Ray, who was partially deaf, began singing professionally at age 15 on Portland radio stations. He gained a local following singing at small, predominantly African-American nightclubs in Detroit, where he was discovered in 1949 and subsequently signed to Okeh Records, a subsidiary of Columbia Records. He rose quickly from obscurity with the release of his debut album &quot;Johnnie Ray&quot; (1952), as well as with a 78 rpm single, both of whose sides reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top Hot 100 chart, &quot;Cry&quot; and &quot;The Little White Cloud That Cried&quot;.

In 1954, Ray made his first film, &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, as part of an ensemble cast that included Ethel Merman and Marilyn Monroe. His career in the music business in his native United States began to decline in 1957, and his American record label dropped him in 1960. He never regained a strong following there and rarely appeared on American television after 1973. Ray’s last television appearance in the United States was on a 1977 syndicated broadcast of &quot;Sha Na Na&quot;. His fanbases in the United Kingdom and Australia remained strong until his final global concert tour in 1989.

&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; noted that Ray was &quot;a sensation in the 1950s; the heart-wrenching vocal delivery of &#x27;Cry&#x27; ... influenced many acts including Elvis, and was the prime target for teen hysteria in the pre-Presley days.&quot; Ray&#x27;s dramatic stage performances and melancholic songs have been credited by music historians as precursory to later performers ranging from Leonard Cohen to Morrissey.

==Early life==
John Alvin Ray was born on January 10, 1927, in Dallas, Oregon, to Hazel (née Simkins) and Elmer Ray. Along with older sister Elma, Ray spent part of his childhood on a farm and attended grade school in Dallas. Ray began playing the piano at age three, and beginning at age 12 sang in the local church choir. After the United States entered World War II, the family moved to Portland, Oregon, where Ray attended Franklin High School.

At age 13, Ray became deaf in his left ear following a mishap that occurred during a Boy Scout ritual called a &quot;blanket toss&quot;. In later years, Ray performed wearing a hearing aid. Surgery performed in 1958 left him almost completely deaf in both ears, although hearing aids helped his condition. Ray credited his deafness as pivotal to his career and performance style, saying, &quot;My need for sincerity traces back to when I was a child and lost my hearing. I became withdrawn. I had an emotional need to develop a relationship to other people.&quot; After graduating from high school, Ray worked as a soda jerk, a bus boy, and a mill worker in Salem. In the interim, he did jobs playing piano at clubs in Salem and Portland.

==Career==
===Early career and success===
Inspired by rhythm singers like Kay Starr, LaVern Baker, and Ivory Joe Hunter, Ray developed a unique rhythm-based singing style described as alternating between pre-rock rhythm and blues and a more conventional classic pop approach. He began singing professionally on a Portland, Oregon, radio station at age 15, sharing billing with Jane Powell, then a local young singer.

He later performed in comedy shows and theatrical productions in Seattle, Washington before relocating to Detroit, Michigan. In Detroit, Ray regularly performed at the Flame Show Bar Talent Club, an African-American nightclub, where he developed a local following. While performing at the Flame, Ray attracted the attention of song plugger Bernie Lang, who saw him perform with local DJ Robin Seymour of WKMH. Lang went to New York to sell the singer to Danny Kessler of the Okeh Records label. Kessler came over from New York, and he, Lang, and Seymour went to the Flame. According to Seymour, Kessler&#x27;s reaction was, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know. This kid looks well on the stand, but he will never go on records.&quot;

It was Seymour and Lowell Worley of the local office of Columbia Records who persuaded Kessler to have a test record made of Ray. Worley arranged for a record to be cut at United Sound Studios in Detroit. Seymour told reporter Dick Osgood that there was a verbal agreement that he would be cut in on the three-way deal in the management of Ray. However, the deal mysteriously evaporated, and so did Seymour&#x27;s friendship with Kessler.

Ray&#x27;s first record for the race label Okeh, the self-penned R&amp;B number &quot;Whiskey and Gin&quot;, was a minor hit in 1951. When executives at Okeh&#x27;s parent Columbia Records realized that the Caucasian Ray had developed a fan base of Caucasian listeners, he was moved over to the Columbia label. In 1952, he dominated the American popular music charts with the double-sided hit single of &quot;Cry&quot; and &quot;The Little White Cloud That Cried&quot;. Selling over two million copies of the 78 rpm single, Ray&#x27;s delivery struck a chord with teenagers and he quickly became a teen idol.

The live television broadcast of &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; on January 6, 1952, included the first of his several appearances on the widely-seen program that officially changed its title in 1955 to &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

Ray&#x27;s performing style included theatrics later associated with rock and roll, including tearing at his hair, falling to the floor, and crying on stage. Ray quickly earned the nicknames &quot;Mr. Emotion&quot;, &quot;The Nabob of Sob&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Wails&quot;, and several others. One source states that Ray &quot;opened the way for Elvis and the overt sexual energy of rock and roll ... [and] is credited by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elton John as being a formative influence on their artistic styles&quot;. As well, Ray&#x27;s manager said that Elvis Presley often watched Johnnie&#x27;s concerts.

20th Century Fox executives included him in the ensemble cast of the film &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot; (1954) alongside Ethel Merman as his mother, Dan Dailey as his father, Donald O&#x27;Connor as his brother, Mitzi Gaynor as his sister, and Marilyn Monroe as his sister-in-law. His second and final film role was a cameo as a police officer in &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery&quot;, which was intended for release to cinemas in 1968 but was withdrawn. It wasn&#x27;t seen publicly until NBC telecast it in 1972, and it never was distributed to theaters. In the 1980s when Ray was asked why he never had made another widely seen film after &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;, he replied, &quot;I was never asked.&quot;

In the 1950s, after both sides of the single &quot;Cry&quot;/&quot;The Little White Cloud That Cried&quot; ran their course, more hit songs followed. They included &quot;Please, Mr. Sun&quot;, &quot;Such a Night&quot;, &quot;Walkin&#x27; My Baby Back Home&quot;, &quot;A Sinner Am I&quot;, and &quot;Yes Tonight Josephine&quot;. He scored a number-one hit in the United Kingdom with &quot;Just Walkin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (which he initially disliked) during the Christmas season in 1956. He hit again in 1957 with &quot;You Don&#x27;t Owe Me a Thing&quot;, which reached number 10 on the Billboard charts in the United States. Though his American popularity was declining in 1957, he remained popular in the United Kingdom, breaking the attendance record at the London Palladium formerly set by fellow Columbia Records artist Frankie Laine. In later years, he retained a loyal fan base overseas, particularly in Australia.

===Later career===

Ray had a close relationship with journalist and television game show panelist Dorothy Kilgallen. They became acquainted soon after his sudden rise to stardom in the United States. They remained close as his American career declined.

Two months before Kilgallen&#x27;s death in 1965, her newspaper column plugged Ray&#x27;s engagements at the Latin Quarter in New York and the Tropicana Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He began his gig at the Latin Quarter immediately after an eight-month vacation in Spain, during which he and new manager Bill Franklin had extricated themselves from contracts with Bernie Lang, who had managed Ray from 1951 to 1963. Ray and Franklin believed that a dishonest Lang had been responsible for the end of Ray&#x27;s stardom in the United States and for large debts that he owed the Internal Revenue Service.

In 1969, Ray headlined a European concert tour with Judy Garland. He served as the best man at her wedding to her last husband, nightclub manager Mickey Deans, in London on March 15, 1969. Denmark and Sweden were among the countries where Ray and Garland performed together; they played in Stockholm on March 19.

In the early 1970s, Ray&#x27;s American career revived to a limited extent, as he had not released a record album or single in over a decade. He made network television appearances on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot; in 1970, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; three times during 1972 and 1973. His personal manager, Bill Franklin, resigned in 1976 and cut off contact with the singer a few years later. Ray’s last television appearance in the United States was on a 1977 syndicated broadcast of &quot;Sha Na Na&quot;. His American revival turned out to be short-lived, as his career had already begun to decline as the 1980s approached.

In 1981, Ray hired Alan Eichler as his manager and resumed performing with an instrumental trio rather than with the large orchestras to which he and his audiences had been accustomed for the first 25 years of his career. When Ray and the trio performed at a New York club called Marty&#x27;s on Third Avenue and East 73rd Street in 1981, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;The fact that Mr. Ray, in the years since his first blush of success, has been seen and heard so infrequently in the United States is somewhat ironic because it was his rhythm and blues style of singing that help[ed] lay the groundwork for the rock-and-roll that turned Mr. Ray&#x27;s entertainment world around. Recently, Ringo Starr of the Beatles pointed out that the three singers that the Beatles listened to in their fledgling days were Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Johnnie Ray.&quot;

In 1986, Ray appeared as a Los Angeles taxicab driver in Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Need a Gun&quot; video, and is name-checked in the lyrics of the song. During this time period, Ray was generally playing small venues in the United States such as Citrus College in Los Angeles County, California. He performed there in 1987 &quot;with a big-band group,&quot; according to a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; profile of him during that year. Other 1980s appearances included the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas, Resorts International in Atlantic City, and the Vine St. Bar and Grill in Hollywood, where his show was broadcast live by KKJZ (&quot;K-Jazz&quot;) radio. In February 1987, a high-school gym in Alexandria, Louisiana was the venue for a &quot;Big Band Gala of Stars&quot; that included short sets by Ray, Barbara McNair, and other aging singers.

In 1986, Ray and sitcom actress Marla Gibbs were among the notables who helped dedicate Billie Holiday&#x27;s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

While Ray&#x27;s popularity continued to wane in the United States throughout the 1980s, Australian, English and Scottish promoters booked him for large venues as late as 1989, his last year of performing.

==Musical influences==
Ray was significantly influenced by gospel music and numerous African American singers, specifically Billie Holiday, Little Miss Cornshucks and LaVern Baker, as well as Judy Garland and Kay Starr.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and sexuality===

In 1951, before Ray became well known, he was arrested in Detroit, Michigan, for soliciting and accosting an undercover male vice-squad police officer for sex in the restroom of the Stone Theatre, a burlesque house. When he appeared in court, he pleaded guilty to the charges, paid a fine, and was released. Detroit newspapers did not report the story because of his obscurity at the time. After his rise to fame the following year, rumors about his sexuality began to spread as a result of the incident.

Despite her knowledge of the solicitation arrest, Marilyn Morrison, daughter of the owner of the Mocambo nightclub, married Ray at the peak of his American fame. The wedding ceremony took place in New York a short time after he gave his first New York concert, which was at the Copacabana. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; made the wedding its cover story for May 26, 1952, and it reported that guests included Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri.

Aware of Ray&#x27;s unorthodox sexuality, Morrison told a friend she would &quot;straighten it out.&quot; The couple separated in 1953 and divorced in 1954. Several writers have noted that the Ray–Morrison marriage occurred under false pretenses, and that Ray had had a long-term relationship with his manager Bill Franklin. However, a biography of Ray points out that Franklin was 13 years younger than Ray, and that both their personal and business relationships began in 1963, many years after the Ray–Morrison divorce. In a 1953 newspaper interview with James Bacon, Ray blamed rumors about his sexuality for the breakup of his marriage to Morrison.

In 1959, Ray was arrested again in Detroit for soliciting an undercover officer at the Brass Rail, a bar that was described many years later by one biographer as a haven for musicians, and by another biographer as a gay bar. Ray went to trial following this second arrest and was found not guilty. Two years after his death, several friends shared with biographer Jonny Whiteside their knowledge that Ray was bisexual.

According to Ray&#x27;s two biographers, Jonny Whiteside and Tad Mann, he did not have a close relationship with a man or a woman during the 13 years he lived after Bill Franklin stopped interacting with him and phoning him. Ray did maintain a loyal friendship with his road manager Tad Mann, who was married with five children. When Ray gave parties at his Los Angeles home in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, frequent guests included Mann (real name Harold Gaze Mann III), and actress Jane Withers.

According to lawyer and researcher Mark Shaw, Ray&#x27;s relationship with Dorothy Kilgallen produced her youngest child Kerry Kollmar, whom her husband Richard Kollmar disowned after Kilgallen&#x27;s death in 1965. In two books that Shaw has authored, he claims that Kilgallen remained faithful to her husband for 13 years, ignoring rumors of his extramarital affairs because she did not witness evidence of any of them during that time frame. After years of infidelity, Kollmar became careless, to the extent that in 1953 he brought a male lover into the third-floor master bedroom of his and Dorothy&#x27;s new home, a five-story townhouse on Manhattan&#x27;s East 68th Street. After Kilgallen caught the two men in a compromising position, she and Kollmar decided to stay married strictly for business. Their business included a talk radio show they broadcast from home every day that brought them large salaries and that promoted Broadway shows produced by Kollmar. &quot;Dorothy and Dick&quot;, as their radio listeners knew them, discussed Ray&#x27;s singing style on their program, according to a profile of Ray in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; edition dated July 26, 1952.

In 1954, Kilgallen gave birth to a baby boy who was photographed for magazines and newspapers with her holding him, never with a father. Decades later, Ray often mentioned Kilgallen to his manager Alan Eichler and remained devastated by her unexpected death in 1965. According to Eichler, Ray never spoke about or acknowledged the rumors that he fathered Kilgallen&#x27;s third child. Throughout the 1980s when Eichler managed Ray, historians of popular music did not consider Ray important enough to research his private life, so Eichler was not familiar with the eyewitness accounts that Mark Shaw discovered years later, and Eichler did not ask Ray about possible fatherhood.

===Health problems===
Ray suffered from alcoholism throughout his life, though during the 1950s at the height of his fame, newspaper and magazine pieces about Ray did not disclose the extent of his drinking problem. On September 2, 1952, Ray was arrested in Boston for public intoxication, but was released four hours later. According to biographer Jonny Whiteside, he drank heavily then. In 1960, he was hospitalized for tuberculosis. Shortly after his recovery, he quit drinking, according to Whiteside. His music was not available for sale, and he did not appear on American television during the first half of the 1960s. Consequently, American newspapers ran display ads for his concerts but reported nothing about his life, such as marital status, offstage behavior, or health issues.

It was not until December 1966 that Ray returned to American television, and even then it was only in a program telecast locally in Chicago, but not elsewhere, titled &quot;An Evening with Johnnie Ray&quot;. Video footage of this performance was reviewed by Whiteside in the early 1990s, and he wrote in his biography that Ray appeared emaciated and unhealthy.

In 1969, shortly after Ray returned to the United States from a European tour with Judy Garland, an American doctor informed him that he was well enough to drink an occasional glass of wine. He instead resumed drinking heavily, and his health began to decline. Despite this, in the early 1970s he appeared several times on prime-time network television in the United States. After the offers for television stopped, he continued touring, attracting major media attention outside the United States, until he gave his final concert, a benefit for the Grand Theater in Salem, Oregon on October 6, 1989. Ray performed for many years after the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; began investigating and reporting celebrity substance abuse, but it made no mention of him during his lifetime.

==Death==
In early 1990, poor health forced Ray to check into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center near his home in Los Angeles. He was confined there for more than two weeks without the knowledge of journalists or talk radio personalities who had interviewed him in various countries throughout the 1980s.

On February 24, 1990, he died of hepatic encephalopathy resulting from liver failure at Cedars-Sinai. Kay Starr was among those who spoke at a public memorial service held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. He is buried at Hopewell Cemetery near Hopewell, Oregon.

==Legacy==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Johnnie Ray was honored with a star in 1960 on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6201 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1999, Bear Family Records issued two five-CD sets of his entire body of work, each containing an 84-page book on his career. Companies including Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Columbia Records) and Collectables have kept his large catalogue of recordings in continual release worldwide.

Music journalist Robert A. Rodriguez noted Ray&#x27;s contemporary obscurity in his 2006 book &quot;The 1950s&#x27; Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Rock &amp; Roll Rebels, Cold War Crises, and All American Oddities&quot;, writing:

Scholar Cheryl Herr notes the impact of Ray&#x27;s deafness on his unique performing style and vocals, writing, &quot;[Ray was] a singer whose hearing range appears literally to have defined the contour of his performance, the nature of his short-lived popularity, and his enduring iconic status in pre-rock and proto-rock.&quot;

===In popular culture===
Archival footage of Ray arriving at London Heathrow Airport in 1954 was featured in the 1982 music video for Dexys Midnight Runners&#x27; hit single &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;. The lyrics of the song also mention him: &quot;Poor old Johnnie Ray sounded sad upon the radio/Moved a million hearts in mono.&quot;

Ray is mentioned in the lyrics of Billy Idol&#x27;s 1986 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Need a Gun&quot;, and appears in the video.

Multiple elements of Ray&#x27;s self-composed hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love again&quot; are sampled in Portishead&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Biscuit&quot;.

He is mentioned in the lyrics of Van Morrison&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Sometimes We Cry&quot; from his album &quot;The Healing Game&quot;, a song that features the backing vocals of Brian Kennedy and Georgie Fame.

Ray is one of the cultural touchstones mentioned in the first verse (concerning events from the late 1940s and early 1950s) of Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 hit single &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;, between Red China and &quot;South Pacific&quot;.

He is mentioned in the lyrics of Jimmy Ray&#x27;s 1997 song &quot;Are You Jimmy Ray?&quot;

Ray was also referred to in two Eartha Kitt songs: &quot;Monotonous&quot; from &quot;New Faces of 1952&quot; (&quot;I even made Johnnie Ray smile for me&quot;), and &quot;I Want to Be Evil&quot; (&quot;I want to sing songs like the guy who cries&quot;).

A fictionalized version of him appears in James Ellroy&#x27;s 2021 novel &quot;Widespread Panic&quot;.

Bob Dylan has spoken about his very early influences, before he had ever listened to a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record or Hank Williams. Dylan was quoted as saying, &quot;Before that, Johnny [sic] Ray. He was the first singer whose voice and style, I guess, I totally fell in love with. There was just something about the way he sang &#x27;When Your Sweetheart Sends A Letter&#x27;...that just knocked me out. I loved his style, wanted to dress like him too.&quot;

<doc id="320779" wikidata="Q1233197" url="?curid=320779" title="Oblique case">
<text>In grammar, an oblique (abbreviated ; from ) or objective case (abbr. ) is a nominal case other than the nominative case and, sometimes, the vocative.

A noun or pronoun in the oblique case can generally appear in any role except as subject, for which the nominative case is used. The term &quot;objective case&quot; is generally preferred by modern English grammarians, where it supplanted Old English&#x27;s dative and accusative.
When the two terms are contrasted, they differ in the ability of a word in the oblique case to function as a possessive attributive; whether English has an oblique rather than an objective case then depends on how &quot;proper&quot; or widespread one considers the dialects where such usage is employed.

An oblique case often contrasts with an unmarked case, as in English oblique &quot;him and &quot;them versus nominative &quot;he&quot; and &quot;they&quot;. However, the term &quot;oblique&quot; is also used for languages without a nominative case, such as ergative–absolutive languages; in the Northwest Caucasian languages, for example, the oblique-case marker serves to mark the ergative, dative, and applicative case roles, contrasting with the absolutive case, which is unmarked.

== Hindustani ==

Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu) nouns, pronouns and postpositions decline for an oblique case which exclusively serves to mark the grammatical case roles using the case-marking postpositions. The oblique case has similarities with the vocative case in Hindustani. Some examples of the declension pattern are shown in the tables below:
==Bulgarian==
Bulgarian, an analytic Slavic language, also has an oblique case form for pronouns:

Dative role:
* &quot;Give that ball &quot;to me&quot;&quot; дай тaзи топка на мен (&quot;day tazi topka na men&quot;)

(This oblique case is a relic of the original, more complex proto-Slavic system of noun cases, and there are remnants of other cases in Bulgarian, such as the vocative case of direct address)

==English==
An objective case is marked on the English personal pronouns and as such serves the role of the accusative and dative cases that other Indo-European languages employ. These forms are often called object pronouns. They serve a variety of grammatical functions which they would not in languages that differentiate the two. An example using first person singular objective pronoun me:

*in an accusative role for a direct object (including double object and oblique ditransitives):
::&quot;Do you see me?&quot;
::&quot;The army sent me to Korea.&quot;

*in a dative role for an indirect object:
::&quot;Kim passed the pancakes to me.&quot;
::&quot;Kim passed me the pancakes.&quot;

*as the object of a preposition (except in possessives):
::&quot;That picture of me was blurry.&quot;
::(cf. double genitive as in &quot;That picture of mine was stolen.&quot;)

*in copular deixis:
::[referring to a photograph] &quot;This is me on the beach.&quot;

*in existentials (sometimes, but not always, replaceable by the nominative—in very formal style):
::&quot;It&#x27;s me again.&quot; 
::(&quot;cf. Once again, it is I.&quot; [formal])
::&quot;Who is it?—It&#x27;s me.&quot;
::(&quot;cf. It is I &quot;[&quot;to whom you are speaking&quot;].)
::It&#x27;s me who should fix it.&quot;
::(&quot;cf. Since I made it, it is I who should fix it.&quot;)

*in a nominative role with predicate or verbal ellipsis:
::&quot;Who made this bicycle?—Me.&quot;
::(&quot;cf. Who made this bicycle?—I did.&quot;)
::&quot;I like him.—Hey, me too.&quot;
::(&quot;cf. I like him.—Hey, I do too.&quot;)
::&quot;Who&#x27;s gonna clean up this mess?—Not me!&quot;

*in coordinated nominals:
::&quot;Me and him are going to the store.&quot; (only in colloquial speech)
::(&quot;cf. Is he going? Yes, he and I are going.&quot;)

*as a disjunctive topic marker:
::&quot;Me, I like French.&quot;

The pronoun &quot;me&quot; is not inflected differently in any of these uses; it is used for all grammatical relationships except the genitive case of possession (in standard English) and a non-disjunctive nominative case as the subject.

*It may also be used as a comedic stylistic effect of blatant error (nonstandard, pidgin, baby or foreigner talk or &quot;broken English&quot;):
::[spoken by Cookie Monster] &quot;Me so hungry.&quot; 
::(&quot;the above example also employs copula deletion to similar effect&quot;)

==French==
Old French had a nominative case and an oblique case, called and respectively.

In Modern French, the two cases have mostly merged and the &quot;cas régime&quot; has survived as the sole form for the majority of nouns. For example, the word &quot;&quot;conte&quot; (count, earl)&quot;:
*Old French: 
**Nominative: li (singular), li (plural)
**Oblique: le (singular), les (plural)
*Modern French:
** le (singular), les (plural)

In some cases, both the &quot;cas sujet&quot; and &quot;cas régime&quot; of one noun have survived but produced two nouns in Modern French with different meanings. For example, today&#x27;s means &quot;friend&quot; and means &quot;companion&quot;, but in Old French these were different declensions of the same noun.

==Kurdish==
Kurdish has an oblique for pronouns, objects, and for objects of izafe constructs.

<doc id="320781" wikidata="Q234610" url="?curid=320781" title="Anne Heche">
<text>Anne Celeste Heche ( ; May 25, 1969August 11, 2022) was an American actress, known for her roles across a variety of genres in film, television, and theater. She was the recipient of Daytime Emmy, National Board of Review, and GLAAD Media Awards, in addition to nominations for a Tony Award and a Primetime Emmy.

Heche began her professional acting career on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; (1987–1991), earning a Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love. She made her film debut in 1993 with a small role in &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot;. Heche&#x27;s profile rose in 1997 with appearances in &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, &quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, and &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;. In 1998, she had starring roles in the romantic adventure &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; and the drama-thriller &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;.

From 1999 to 2001, Heche focused on directing, most notably a segment of the HBO television film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; (2000). She was nominated for a Tony Award for her starring role in the 2004 Broadway revival of &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, as well as a Primetime Emmy Award that same year for her appearance in the television film &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Other film appearances included &quot;Prozac Nation&quot; (2001), &quot;John Q.&quot; (2002), &quot;Birth&quot; (2004), &quot;Spread&quot; (2009), &quot;Cedar Rapids&quot; (2011), &quot;Catfight&quot; (2016), and &quot;My Friend Dahmer&quot; (2017). Heche also starred on a number of television series, such as The WB&#x27;s &quot;Everwood&quot; (2004–2005), ABC&#x27;s &quot;Men in Trees&quot; (2006–2008), and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Brave&quot; (2017–2018). In 2020, she appeared as a contestant on the 29th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, finishing in 13th place.

Events in Heche&#x27;s personal life often upstaged her acting career. She was in a high-profile relationship with comedian Ellen DeGeneres between 1997 and 2000, with the pair being described by &quot;The Advocate&quot; as &quot;the first gay supercouple&quot;. Immediately following her split from DeGeneres, she suffered a highly publicized psychotic break. In 2001, Heche published a memoir titled &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot;, in which she alleged extensive sexual abuse by her father.

On August 5, 2022, Heche was critically injured in a high-speed car crash. She died at a Los Angeles hospital on August 11, 2022, at the age of 53.

== Early life ==
Anne Celeste Heche was born on May 25, 1969, in Aurora, Ohio, the youngest of five children of Donald &quot;Don&quot; Joe Heche and Nancy Heche (née Prickett). During her early childhood, the Heche family lived in various towns around Ohio, including suburbs of Cleveland and Akron. Heche&#x27;s parents were fundamentalist Christians and the family was raised in a deeply religious environment, a situation that she later likened to being &quot;raised in a cult&quot;. At the same time, her father led an unstable lifestyle, often changing professions and prone to frequent get-rich-quick schemes, though also with a real gift for music that led to jobs as a choir director in several churches. Heche noted in her memoir that her family changed denominations several times depending on which church her father found work in.

Because of Don Heche&#x27;s often unstable lifestyle and financial situation, the family moved numerous times during her childhood. One of his financial schemes led the family to resettle in the Atlantic City, New Jersey, area in 1977, first in Ventnor City and later Ocean City. One of Anne&#x27;s first jobs was at a boardwalk hamburger stand, where she would sing songs from &quot;Annie&quot; to attract customers. 

The Heche family&#x27;s precarious financial situation led to the foreclosure of a home her father owned and later their eviction from a rental home. They moved in with a family from their church who offered them a place to live as an act of charity. Anne&#x27;s mother separated from her father and demanded he leave the household. Her mother and all of the children then took jobs to support the family and be able to live on their own. Anne found work at a dinner theater in Swainton, her first professional acting job, earning $100 a week (about $300 per week in 2022 dollars).

Don Heche moved to New York City, where Anne and her sisters would occasionally visit him, noticing his declining health. He claimed it was cancer, when in fact he had developed late-stage AIDS. Although he lived as a gay man in New York, Don kept his sexuality and the nature of his illness from his family. They did not know about his diagnosis and had not even heard of AIDS until coming across an article on the disease in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about a month before his death. Don died from AIDS-related complications on March 3, 1983, aged 45. In a 1998 interview, Anne reflected that her father being closeted ultimately &quot;destroyed his happiness and our family. But it did teach me to tell the truth. Nothing else is worth anything.&quot;

Three months after her father&#x27;s death, Anne&#x27;s 18-year-old brother Nathan was killed in a car crash when his vehicle missed a curve and struck a tree. The remainder of her immediate family subsequently moved to Chicago to be closer to other family members. Anne, her mother and her older sister Abigail, who had left college, were all living together in a one-bedroom apartment, which lacked privacy and which Anne would compare to living in a dorm room.

Heche attended the progressive Francis W. Parker School, where she continued to be active in theater, performing in such plays as Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; and Irwin Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Bury the Dead&quot;. When she was aged 16, a talent scout spotted her in a school play and invited her to audition for the daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Heche flew to New York with her mother, auditioned, and was offered a part. She was not able to accept the offer, as it would have entailed moving with her family to New York in the middle of her school year and having her mother leave a new job at a brokerage firm. In her memoir, Heche notes that she really wanted to move out on her own and &quot;escape [her] mother&#x27;s grasp&quot;, but this was not an option while she was still a minor.

In 1987, at the end of her senior year, Heche was offered another audition, this time for the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;. She was offered a role after two auditions and accepted, in spite of her mother&#x27;s opposition. She moved to New York City and started work on the series, in her debut television role, just days after her high school graduation. In a later interview she stated, &quot;I did my time with my mom in a one-bedroom, skanky apartment and I was done.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1987–1996: Early television and film roles ===
Heche performed on &quot;Another World&quot; in the dual role of twins Vicky Hudson and Marley Love. She continued on the series for nearly four years, from 1987 to 1991. She received several awards for her work on &quot;Another World&quot;, including a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 1991.

Heche was unsure about her future as an actress after leaving &quot;Another World&quot;, having not performed in any other onscreen roles during her time on the soap opera and not having any acting jobs in place at the time she decided to leave. She knew that she did not want to continue in soap operas, something that was considered fairly insignificant in the larger world of professional acting. As a backup plan, she applied to and received an offer of acceptance from Parsons School of Design in New York City. However, right after applying to design school, she was offered a small supporting role in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television film adaptation of the Willa Cather novel &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, featuring Jessica Lange. Heche decided to take that offer rather than attend design school and to continue with her career as an actress.

Heche received news of her Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Another World&quot; while in Nebraska filming &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;. &quot;Does this mean I&#x27;m an actress?&quot; was her response in a telephone call with her agent following the news. The agent suggested that she relocate from New York City to Los Angeles, which she did days after shooting was completed on the film. &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; would air in February 1992 and was Heche&#x27;s first TV movie. Her performance garnered some positive critical notice. After completing &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, Heche starred in a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. Though this episode was shot after &quot;O Pioneers!&quot;, it aired in November 1991 and hence was her primetime television debut and her first screen appearance outside of &quot;Another World&quot;. After her &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; appearance, however, she felt that guest spots on television episodes would be detrimental to her long-term career success and mostly avoided TV guest spots until the 2000s.

Heche also starred in several roles in Los Angeles theater productions in 1991 and 1992, including &quot;Us &amp; Them&quot;, a Generation X slice-of-life piece, and &quot;Getting Away With Murder&quot;, a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain stories &quot;Dead Man&quot; and &quot;The Baby in the Icebox&quot;, which were produced as part of the Mark Taper Forum–sponsored &quot;Sundays at the Itchey Foot&quot; series. In early 1993, Heche made her theatrical film debut in the little-seen independent film &quot;An Ambush of Ghosts&quot;, directed by Everett Lewis. Soon afterward, she appeared in the Disney film &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; with Elijah Wood. Over the next two years, she performed mainly bit parts in feature films such as &quot;A Simple Twist of Fate&quot; (1994) and larger supporting roles in cable television movies such as &quot;Girls in Prison&quot; (1994) and &quot;&quot; (1995).

Heche appeared in her first lead role (albeit receiving third billing) in Donald Cammell&#x27;s straight-to-video erotic thriller &quot;Wild Side&quot; (1995), alongside Christopher Walken and Joan Chen. The film gained some notoriety for its inclusion of a very strong lesbian sex scene between Heche and Chen. In 1996, Heche had the starring role as a college student contemplating an abortion in a segment of the HBO anthology film &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot;, co-starring Jada Pinkett Smith and Cher. Also that year, she appeared opposite Catherine Keener portraying childhood best friends in the independent film &quot;Walking and Talking&quot;. The limited-release film garnered favorable reviews from critics and is number 47 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;s &quot;Top 50 Cult Films of All-Time&quot; list. Heche gained positive notice from film critic Alison Macor of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, who wrote in her review that she &quot;is destined for larger film roles&quot;.

=== 1997–1999: Career breakthrough ===

In 1997, Heche starred in what has been described as her breakthrough role in the hit crime drama &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; as the wife of the main character, an FBI undercover agent played by Johnny Depp. Critic Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Heche &quot;does well with what could have been the thankless role&quot;. 

By the late 1990s, Heche continued to find recognition and commercial success as she took on supporting roles in three other 1997 high-profile film releases—&quot;Volcano&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;. The disaster film &quot;Volcano&quot;, about the formation of a volcano in Los Angeles, had her star with Tommy Lee Jones and Gaby Hoffmann, playing a seismologist. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it grossed US$122 million at the international box office. Heche portrayed the minor role of a backwoods loner in the slasher thriller sleeper hit &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr. Despite her limited screen time in the film, Heche was considered a &quot;standout&quot; by some reviewers, such as Derek Eller of &quot;Variety&quot;. She obtained the part of a presidential advisor opposite Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman in the political satire &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, a role that was originally written for a man. Budgeted at US$15 million, the film made US$64 million. She received the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1997 for her roles in &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; and &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;.

Heche&#x27;s first lead role in a major film came in the 1998 romantic adventure &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot;, where she appeared opposite Harrison Ford, portraying a New York City journalist who ends up with a pilot (Ford) on a deserted island following a crash landing. She had been cast in the film one day before her same-sex relationship with Ellen DeGeneres went public. Although she was cast in a second starring role shortly thereafter as Vince Vaughn&#x27;s love interest in the drama &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; (1998), Heche felt that her relationship with DeGeneres destroyed her prospects as a leading woman. According to Heche, &quot;People said, &#x27;You&#x27;re not getting a job because you&#x27;re gay&#x27;.&quot; She commented: &quot;How could that destroy my career? I still can&#x27;t wrap my head around it.&quot; &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; received mixed reviews, but grossed US$74.3 million in North America and US$164.8 million worldwide. On her appearance in the dramatic thriller &quot;Return to Paradise&quot;, a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked, &quot;as Ms. Heche&#x27;s formidable Beth Eastern does her best to manipulate the other characters on [costar Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s character] behalf, &quot;Return to Paradise&quot; takes on the abstract weightiness of an ethical debate rather than the visceral urgency of a thriller.&quot;

Heche starred in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1998), a remake of the 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the updated version, she took on the role originally played by Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, an embezzler who arrives at an old motel run by serial killer Norman Bates (played by Vince Vaughn in their second collaboration). &quot;Psycho&quot; earned negative reviews, and despite a US$60 million budget it made US$37.1 million worldwide. In an otherwise negative &quot;Times&quot; review of the film, Janet Maslin felt that Heche was &quot;refreshingly cast in Marion&#x27;s role&quot;, while noting that her portrayal was &quot;almost as demure as Ms. Leigh&#x27;s, yet she&#x27;s also more headstrong and flirty.&quot; Heche&#x27;s 1998 films were the only theatrically released films in which she had a leading role. She also starred opposite Ed Harris in the 1999 film, &quot;The Third Miracle&quot;, directed by Agnieszka Holland.

=== 1998–2001: Directing projects ===
Heche spent much of the 1998 to 2001 working on film directing projects, often writing her own screenplays. She pulled back from acting roles during this period and had relatively few acting appearances from 1999 to 2001. Her first effort at writing and directing was a 1998 short film titled &quot;Stripping for Jesus&quot;, which was about an evangelical Christian stripper who writes Bible verses on her body so as to reach clients &quot;in a language that they understand&quot;. According to Heche, the film was a metaphor for &quot;my life as I saw it&quot;. The film was fully self-financed. Heche starred in the film along with Suzanne Krull and Karen Black.

Heche&#x27;s next several films were made for cable television and featured then-partner Ellen DeGeneres in varying degrees of participation. The first of these (and the one with the widest release) came in 2000, when Heche directed a segment of &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; for HBO. An anthology film, it consisted of a series of segments about lesbian life in individual years over several decades. In Heche&#x27;s segment, &quot;2000&quot;, DeGeneres and Sharon Stone starred as a contemporary lesbian couple trying to have a baby together via artificial insemination. DeGeneres was also one of the executive producers of the film. In 2001, Heche directed another anthology film segment, this time part of &quot;On the Edge&quot;, a Showtime anthology of science fiction stories directed by different actresses. Heche&#x27;s segment, titled &quot;Reaching Normal&quot;, was her screenplay adaptation of the short story &quot;Command Performance&quot; by Walter M. Miller Jr. The segment features Andie MacDowell and Paul Rudd in the story of a housewife who enters into a telepathic extramarital affair; the segment includes a cameo appearance by DeGeneres.

Heche also directed a documentary that was to be released in 2001, &quot;Ellen DeGeneres: American Summer&quot;, about DeGeneres&#x27; 2000 stand-up comedy tour. The project was never completed. DeGeneres, who financed the documentary, states that she &quot;burned&quot; the film after attempting to salvage the project following the couple&#x27;s split, but that the memories that it brought back were too painful.

=== 2000–2009: Independent films, TV series, and Broadway roles ===
Most of Heche&#x27;s roles in the early 2000s were in independent films and television; she played the role of Dr. Sterling in the film adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel&#x27;s autobiography about depression, &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;, with Christina Ricci and Jessica Lange. Premiered at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival, the film received a DVD release in 2005. She appeared as a hospital administrator in the thriller &quot;John Q.&quot;, about a father and husband (Denzel Washington) whose son is diagnosed with an enlarged heart. The production made US$102.2 million at the worldwide box office, despite negative reviews by critics. In 2001, Heche obtained a recurring role in the fourth season of the television series &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;.

In 2002, Heche made her Broadway debut in a production of the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama &quot;Proof&quot;, in the role of a young woman who has inherited her father&#x27;s mathematical genius and mental illness. &quot;The New York Times&quot; found Heche to be &quot;consequential&quot; in her portrayal and compared her to Mary-Louise Parker and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who had previously played the character, stating: &quot;[...] Ms. Heche, whose stage experience is limited and who is making her New York stage debut at 33, plays the part with a more appeasing ear and more conventional timing, her take on the character is equally viable. Her Catherine is a case of arrested development, impatient, aggressively indignant, impulsive&quot;. In 2004, Heche received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the Lifetime movie &quot;Gracie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, as well as a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the CBS television film &quot;The Dead Will Tell&quot;. In the same year, she performed on Broadway opposite Alec Baldwin in revival of the play &quot;Twentieth Century,&quot; about a successful and egomaniacal Broadway director (Baldwin), who has transformed a chorus girl (Heche) into a leading lady. For her performance, she was nominated for the 2004 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

Also in 2004, Heche appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Cameron Bright in the well-received independent drama &quot;Birth&quot;. She took on the recurring role on The WB drama &quot;Everwood&quot; during its 2004–05 season, and then a recurring role on &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; as an ex-mob wife and Witness Protection Program subject who requires plastic surgery. Heche continued her television work with Hallmark Hall of Fame Christmas film &quot;Silver Bells&quot; (2005) and in the Lifetime television film &quot;Fatal Desire&quot; (2006), about an ex-cop, played by Eric Roberts, who meets a woman on an online dating site who attempts to get him to kill her husband.
Heche appeared in the small-scale dramedy &quot;Sexual Life&quot; (2005), chronicling modern romantic life and co-starring Azura Skye and Elizabeth Banks. The film was screened on the film festival circuit and received a television premiere. In 2006 she began work on her own series, &quot;Men in Trees&quot;, in which she played a New York author who, after finding out her fiancé is cheating on her, moves to a small town in Alaska which happens to be abundant with single men and few women. &quot;Men in Trees&quot; was canceled in May 2008, after a season shortened by the writer&#x27;s strike. During the airing of the show, Heche starred in the romantic comedy &quot;What Love Is&quot; (2007) and in &quot;Toxic Skies&quot; (2008), a science-fiction thriller based on the chemtrails conspiracy theory.

Heche appeared as the girlfriend of a narcissistic gigolo in the sex comedy &quot;Spread&quot; (2009), co-starring Ashton Kutcher. The film received a limited release in North American theaters while it made US$12 million at the worldwide box office. Matthew Turney of &quot;View London&quot; felt that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s also terrific support&quot; from Heche in what he described as an &quot;enjoyable, sharply written and beautifully shot LA drama&quot;. Also in 2009, she was cast in the HBO dramedy series &quot;Hung&quot;, in a supporting role as the ex-wife of a financially struggling high school coach-turned-male prostitute, portrayed by Thomas Jane. The series received favorable reviews and aired until 2011.

=== 2010–2022: Later acting career ===
Heche&#x27;s cameo appearance as the CEO of an important company in the well-received comedy &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, was followed by a much larger role in the independent comedy &quot;Cedar Rapids&quot; (2011), where she portrayed a seductive insurance agent with whom a naive and idealistic man (played by Ed Helms) becomes smitten. The Sundance-premiered production garnered critical praise and was an arthouse success. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; remarked in his review for the film, &quot;while Heche shines brightest in more brittle mode, as in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Hung&quot;, she strikes a sweet balance between Joan&#x27;s mischievous and maternal sides&quot;.

In the drama &quot;Rampart&quot; (2011), Heche starred with Woody Harrelson and Cynthia Nixon, as one of the two former wives of a corrupt police officer (Harrelson), who also happen to be sisters. The film had a selected theatrical run following its premiere at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival, and garnered an overall positive response; &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, remarked that Heche and her other female co-stars, &quot;allow Harrelson to shine – he has always had a way of preening for women – and he brings out the best in them&quot;. She also starred in Lifetime film &quot;Girl&quot; &quot;Fight&quot; (2011), alongside Jodelle Ferland and James Tupper. Heche then had the leading role in the comedy &quot;That&#x27;s What She Said&quot; (2012), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, followed by the role of the girlfriend of a former pro golfer (Colin Firth) in &quot;Arthur Newman&quot; (also 2012). 

Heche starred with James Tupper, Jennifer Stone, and Rebekah Brandes in the supernatural horror film &quot;Nothing Left to Fear&quot; (2013), about a family&#x27;s life in a new town being interrupted by an unstable man of the cloth. The film received a release for video-on-demand and selected theaters. It was panned by critics, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked that both Heche and Tupper &quot;should write apology notes to their fans&quot;. Also in 2013, Heche headlined the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Save Me&quot;, in which she starred as a Midwestern housewife who believes that she is channeling God. She played the waitress friend of a recovering gambling addict (Jason Statham) in the action thriller &quot;Wild Card&quot; (2014). Distributed for a VOD and limited release in certain parts of North America only, the film only grossed US$6.7 million internationally on a $30 million budget. Heche also had a recurring guest-role on &quot;The Michael J. Fox Show&quot; before its cancellation. In 2013, she signed a first look deal with Universal Television.

USA Network&#x27;s action-adventure drama series, &quot;Dig&quot;, had Heche portray the head of the FBI field office in Jerusalem whose agents uncover a 2,000-year-old conspiracy while investigating an archaeologist&#x27;s murder. The six-episode series premiered in late 2014. The following year, Heche guest-starred in the ABC thriller series &quot;Quantico&quot; playing the role of criminal profiler, Dr. Susan Langdon. On September 27, 2016, she starred in the post-apocalyptic action drama &quot;Aftermath&quot;, which debuted on Canada&#x27;s Space network and on United States&#x27; Syfy. Heche played Karen Copeland, a United States Air Force pilot who must navigate Armageddon, with her university-professor husband Josh (James Tupper) and their three nearly adult children. Neither &quot;Dig&quot; nor &quot;Aftermath&quot; was renewed for a second season.

Heche filmed the supporting part as the lead singer for a Broadway musical in &quot;Opening Night&quot; (2016) with Topher Grace. The musical comedy was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival. In another independent film, the comedy &quot;Catfight&quot; (2016), Heche starred opposite Sandra Oh, portraying one of two bitter rivals who pursue a grudge match that spans a lifetime. Like Heche&#x27;s previous projects, the film premiered on the film-festival circuit and received a VOD and limited release, to largely favorable reviews from critics. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Oh and Heche are great here, giving performances entirely lacking in vanity and self-consciousness. They aren&#x27;t afraid to get ugly, both in their treatment of everyone around them as well as in their post-brawl bruises, which makes them that much funnier.&quot;

In 2017, Heche played a supporting role in &quot;My Friend Dahmer&quot; as Joyce, the mentally ill mother of the teenaged Jeffrey Dahmer (Ross Lynch). She received positive reviews for her performance, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; calling her &quot;nerve-jangling perfection&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; calling her &quot;entertainingly off-kilter&quot;.

On September 25, 2017, Heche debuted as the series lead playing DIA Deputy Director Patricia Campbell in the military/espionage thriller &quot;The Brave&quot;, which lasted for one season on NBC. In 2018, she joined the television series &quot;Chicago P.D.&quot; in a supporting role. In late 2020, Heche competed as one of the celebrities in the 29th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, but was eliminated from the contest after the fourth week. The following year, she co-starred in an ensemble cast in Lindsay Gossling&#x27;s &quot;13 Minutes&quot; about four families struggling with multiple dilemmas in a fictional Oklahoma town just before a devastating tornado hits.

At the time of her death in August 2022, Heche had completed filming several films that were still in post-production and where she would appear posthumously. One of these films was &quot;Girl in Room 13&quot; that aired as part of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Ripped from the Headlines&quot; film series. The movie is about human trafficking and was dedicated in memory of Heche. &quot;Wildfire: The Legend of the Cherokee Ghost Horse&quot; is slated to be the final screen performance for Heche, which is a family-appeal film based on the song &quot;Wildfire&quot; by Michael Martin Murphey. She also appeared with Alec Baldwin in the disaster action film &quot;Supercell&quot;, released on March 17, 2023.

== Other media ==
In 2001, Heche published a memoir titled &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot;, which discussed her family and career background, as well as disclosed her history of mental illness and alleged childhood sexual abuse by her father. In 2021, on her &quot;Better Together&quot; podcast, she said that she was working on a second memoir tentatively titled &quot;Call Me Sane&quot;. In September 2022, the second memoir, now titled &quot;Call Me Anne&quot;, was submitted in manuscript form shortly before her death and was announced for a January 2023 publication.

Heche also narrated several audiobooks, notably, a self-narrated audiobook of &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot;, as well as narrating audiobook versions of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; (1999) and Tess Gerritsen&#x27;s &quot;Vanish&quot; (2005; co-narrated by Ilyana Kadushin). In 2017, Heche hosted a weekly radio show on SiriusXM with Jason Ellis entitled &quot;Love and Heche&quot;. In late 2020, Heche and Heather Duffy Boylston launched a podcast titled &quot;Better Together&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Heche&#x27;s mother, Nancy Heche, has been a Christian therapist since 1997, and since 2005 has focused on &quot;overcoming homosexuality&quot;, frequently speaking at events sponsored by evangelical Christian and Christian right groups, notably the ex-gay ministry Love Won Out.

Heche had four older siblings, three of whom predeceased her. The eldest, Susan Bergman (1957–2006), died of a brain tumor. Bergman was a university lecturer in literature and a Christian writer, whose 1994 memoir titled &quot;Anonymity&quot; described their closeted gay father and the effects that his legacy had on the rest of the family. Another sister, Cynthia, died of a heart defect at two months. Heche&#x27;s only brother, Nathan (1965–1983), died in a car crash at age 18, three months after the death of their father. Heche said his death was a suicide, though her mother and surviving siblings dispute this. Abigail is the fourth sibling, followed by Anne.

Heche was estranged from the surviving members of her family for many years. A rift with her mother began when she first disclosed her relationship with Ellen DeGeneres. The rift deepened when she alleged sexual abuse by her father in &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot;, creating a rift with her two sisters as well. Heche said she had been estranged from her mother since she confronted her about the sexual abuse. Heche&#x27;s mother said it was Anne who cut off communication.

In her 2001 memoir, Heche wrote that her mother was in denial about the alleged sexual abuse. For example, when she contracted genital herpes as an infant, her mother insisted that it was a diaper rash and refused to take her to a doctor. Heche also wrote that her father repeatedly raped her from the time she was an infant until she was 12. When she was asked, &quot;But why would a gay man rape a girl?&quot; in a 2001 interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Heche replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think he was just a gay man. I think he was sexually deviant. My belief was that my father was gay and he had to cover that up. I think he was sexually abusive. The more he couldn&#x27;t be who he was, the more that came out of him in [the] ways that it did.&quot;

Heche&#x27;s mother has denied her daughter&#x27;s allegations and responded in a discussion of the book on an internet forum: &quot;I am trying to find a place for myself in this writing, a place where I as Anne&#x27;s mother do not feel violated or scandalized. I find no place among the lies and blasphemies in the pages of this book.&quot; Anne&#x27;s sister Abigail added, &quot;It is my opinion that my sister Anne truly believes, at this moment, what she has asserted about our father&#x27;s past behavior; however, at the same time, I would like to point out that Anne, in the past, has expressed doubts herself about the accuracy of such memories. Based on my experience and her own expressed doubts, I believe that her memories regarding our father are untrue. And I can state emphatically, regardless of Anne&#x27;s beliefs, that the assertion that our mother knew about such behavior is absolutely false.&quot;

In 2009, Heche told &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
In 2011, Heche told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that she had reconciled with her remaining sister Abigail, but doubted she would be able to repair her relationship with her mother.

Elliot and Natalie Bergman, of the band Wild Belle, are Heche&#x27;s nephew and niece. In 2017, she said that their album &quot;Dreamland&quot; was her favorite album and described herself as a &quot;proud aunt&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Heche was in a relationship with Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac for about one year in the early 1990s and also in a relationship with Steve Martin, whom she had met on the set of &quot;A Simple Twist of Fate&quot;, for about two years during the mid-1990s.

Heche&#x27;s relationship with DeGeneres and the events following their breakup became subjects of widespread media interest. They were described as &quot;the world&#x27;s first gay supercouple&quot;. Heche and DeGeneres started dating in 1997, and at one point said they would get a civil union if such became legal in Vermont. They broke up in August 2000. Heche stated that all of her other romantic relationships were with men. In the memoir &quot;Call Me Anne&quot;, submitted shortly before her death, she wrote that she never identified as a lesbian and did not regard the terms &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;straight&quot; as relevant to her.

Heche claims that there was professional fallout due to her relationship with DeGeneres. She recounts that she was warned not to attend the 1997 premiere of &quot;Volcano&quot; with DeGeneres, and when the couple did so anyway, they were escorted out before the film had ended. Heche said that she was told that she would be denied the part in &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; for going public with her romance with DeGeneres, but landed the role nevertheless. However, Heche did not work in a studio picture for 10 years afterward. In a later podcast, Heche claimed that DeGeneres tried to put her in an institution and that she was effectively blacklisted from DeGeneres&#x27; talk show, which negatively affected her career as studios were reluctant to hire her for films they would be unable to publicize on the widely viewed program.

In 2000, Heche left DeGeneres for Coleman &quot;Coley&quot; Laffoon, a cameraman whom she met when she hired him as part of the camera crew for the television documentary &quot;Ellen DeGeneres: American Summer&quot;, which she was directing. On September 1, 2001, she and Laffoon married. They had a son, Homer Heche Laffoon, in March 2002. Laffoon filed for divorce in February 2007, after five and a half years of marriage. In a separate court filing, he said that Heche &quot;exhibited bizarre and delusional behavior for which she refuses to seek professional help.&quot; The divorce was finalized in March 2009.

Heche left Laffoon for &quot;Men in Trees&quot; co-star James Tupper. During their relationship, Heche described herself and Tupper as being &quot;eternally engaged&quot;. She and Tupper had a son, Atlas Heche Tupper, in March 2009. Tupper and Heche separated in January 2018.

Heche and former &quot;Hung&quot; co-star Thomas Jane announced that they were in a relationship in 2019; they were together into 2020, but had separated by the time of her death.

=== Mental health issues ===
In her memoir &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot;, Heche discusses her struggles with mental health issues and the long-term effect of her childhood abuse. She wrote that she had blocked out much of her childhood and had first gone into therapy during her time on &quot;Another World&quot;, undergoing various types of therapy through the mid-1990s. Heche soon began Reichian body psychotherapy, and wrote that the release of body memories through this technique helped her recover memories of her alleged sexual abuse and confront the emotional aftermath of childhood trauma. This process was later continued through guided LSD therapy, which she claimed had led to a full recovery of childhood memories.

Heche underwent another crisis that began about the time she had finished filming &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, in which she said that she began hearing God speaking directly to her. In this state, she said that she was told that she had an inner being called &quot;Celestia&quot; who was an incarnation of God and the Second Coming of Jesus. She believed that it was her mission to enlighten humanity and that she had achieved fame in order to fulfill this role. Heche&#x27;s initial experience of hearing and being directed by what she claimed was God lasted for twelve days, and her spiritual experiences and alter ego as Celestia continued for another four years. During this time, Heche claimed to have had experiences with glossolalia, automatic writing and drawing, clairvoyance, the ability to psychically heal others and having stigmata appear on her feet.

On August 19, 2000, immediately following her separation from DeGeneres, Heche drove on Interstate 5 from Los Angeles to the San Joaquin Valley. Exiting where she later said she &quot;had been told&quot; to go, she ended up in Cantua Creek, a rural area in western Fresno County, California. Heche left her vehicle at the side of a rural road and, wearing only a bra and shorts, walked in extremely hot weather without water, before feeling dehydrated and knocking on the door of a ranch house. The homeowner recognized Heche from &quot;Six Days, Seven Nights&quot; and was astonished that a celebrity would show up at her &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot; location. 

After the homeowner let Heche in and gave her a glass of water, Heche took off her shoes and requested to take a shower, with which the homeowner obliged. She assumed that Heche was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, but Heche later revealed to officers that she had taken ecstasy. After taking a shower, Heche entered the living room, asked for a pair of slippers, and suggested that they should watch a movie. Unsure of what to do after Heche had been at the house for a half an hour without contacting anyone, the resident contacted the Fresno County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Heche later told the deputies that she was &quot;God, and was going to take everyone back to heaven…in a spaceship.&quot; She was then taken to Fresno&#x27;s University Medical Center by ambulance and was admitted to its psychiatric unit, but she was released within a few hours. The unit&#x27;s personnel described the incident as a psychotic break.

Heche stated that she was insane for the first 31 years of her life, and that her insanity was triggered by the sexual abuse that her father subjected her to during her childhood. In a series of nationally televised interviews to promote &quot;Call Me Crazy&quot; in September 2001, she stated that she created a fantasy world called the &quot;Fourth Dimension&quot; and the alter ego &quot;Celestia&quot; to make herself feel safe. Heche said she recovered from her mental health concerns following the incident in Cantua Creek and had put her alter ego behind her.

=== Allegations against Harvey Weinstein ===
In a January 2018 interview on the podcast &quot;Allegedly with Theo Von and Matthew Cole Weiss&quot;, Heche alleged that Harvey Weinstein had exposed himself to her and demanded oral sex, and claimed to have been fired from an unspecified Miramax film in retaliation after she refused Weinstein&#x27;s advances. She said that there were many other incidents of sexual harassment that took place during her career and stated that her survival of childhood sexual abuse had given her the strength to stand up to unwanted advances such as those made by Weinstein. A spokesman for Weinstein said that he had been &quot;friendly&quot; with Heche, but denied all of her allegations.

== Death ==
=== Car crash ===
On August 5, 2022, Heche was involved in a sequence of three motor vehicle collisions in the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles, the final collision being the most serious, inflicting critical injuries on Heche and destroying a house. 

The first collision took place when Heche&#x27;s vehicle struck an apartment garage and caused minor damage. A video released by TMZ shows her vehicle, a Mini Clubman, at the scene of the collision and an unidentified man repeatedly shouting, &quot;Out of the car!&quot; at the driver. The vehicle then reversed and left the scene of the collision. The driver in the photo released by TMZ was identified as Heche. 

TMZ also reported a second hit-and-run in which Heche&#x27;s Mini struck a Jaguar without stopping, though without injury to the other driver. An accompanying video shows the Mini speeding down an alleyway and nearly hitting a pedestrian. A doorbell video recorded in the moments before the final crash shows Heche&#x27;s vehicle driving along a neighborhood street at a very high speed, followed a few seconds later by the sound of a crash.

In the final crash, Heche&#x27;s vehicle struck a house, broke through a wall and embedded itself into the building, trapping Heche inside. The vehicle caught fire, which rapidly spread through the entire building. The resulting house fire took 65 minutes to be fully extinguished and required 59 firefighters. Firefighters were unable to access and fully extricate Heche from the vehicle for 45 minutes after their arrival on the scene, and initially were not aware that a person was trapped in the vehicle itself. Heche had sustained severe burns and smoke inhalation injuries by the time she was rescued. The house was left structurally compromised and uninhabitable. The tenant living in the house was in the rear of the structure at the time of the collision and only sustained minor injuries, but her attorney said that she and her pets &quot;almost lost their lives&quot; and that she had lost all of her personal property in the fire.

Law enforcement officials initially stated that Heche was &quot;deemed to be under the influence and acting erratically&quot; at the time of the crashes. The Los Angeles Police Department said that a preliminary blood analysis showed the presence of both cocaine and narcotics, including fentanyl, in her system; however, the coroner&#x27;s report concluded that she was not impaired at the time of the crash. 

=== Hospitalization and death ===
As Heche was being removed from the crash scene, she was filmed sitting up on the stretcher and struggling with firefighters while she was being wheeled into the ambulance but lost consciousness soon afterward. Heche was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for emergency care, and then to Grossman Burn Center at West Hills Hospital for specialized burn center care. On August 8, a representative for Heche said that she was in a coma in critical condition, requiring medical ventilation for pulmonary injury sustained in the accident. The representative also said that prior reports that Heche was in &quot;stable condition&quot; were &quot;inaccurate&quot;.

On August 11, the representative said that Heche was not expected to survive an anoxic brain injury she had sustained, but that she was being kept on life support to determine if her organs were viable for donation, in accordance with her expressed wish to be an organ donor. Heche was declared brain dead a few hours later, but remained on life support to assess organ donor viability and locate recipients. Heche was considered legally dead at that time under California law.

Police had investigated the crash as a felony DUI collision but said there would be no more investigative efforts after Heche was declared brain-dead.

On August 14, it was announced that organ recipients had been found and that her body would undergo the organ donation procedure that day. To honor her organ donation, hospital staff held an honor walk for Heche. That evening, her publicist announced that she had been &quot;peacefully taken off life support.&quot; The office of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner recorded the cause of death as &quot;inhalation and thermal injuries&quot;, with &quot;sternal fracture due to blunt trauma&quot; listed as an &quot;other significant condition&quot;, and ruled her death an accident.

On December 6, 2022, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner announced the results of Heche&#x27;s autopsy, stating that she was not impaired by illicit substances at the time of the incident and that no active drugs were found in her system. An inactive metabolite of cocaine was found through a blood test taken when Heche arrived at the hospital, which the coroner&#x27;s office said indicates the drug was used in the past, but not at the time of the crash. Cannabinoids were detected in Heche&#x27;s urine but not in the blood test, which was consistent with prior use, but not during the time of the incident. Fentanyl was also detected in Heche&#x27;s system, but it was determined that it was from treatment she received at the hospital.

Heche&#x27;s cremated remains were interred in a mausoleum at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on May 14, 2023.

=== Estate ===
On August 31, 2022, Heche&#x27;s older son Homer Heche Laffoon filed a petition in the Los Angeles County probate court claiming that Heche had died intestate, asking that he be named her estate&#x27;s administrator. Laffoon&#x27;s lawyer also stated that they wished to have a third party appointed guardian &quot;ad litem&quot; for Heche&#x27;s younger son (and Laffoon&#x27;s half-brother), Atlas Heche Tupper.

On September 15, Heche&#x27;s former boyfriend, James Tupper, filed a petition raising objections to Laffoon&#x27;s. He argued that an email sent by Heche in 2011 describing her wishes in the event of her death should be treated as her will. Tupper&#x27;s petition challenged Laffoon&#x27;s qualifications to administer the estate, claiming that at 20 years of age he lacked the maturity required of an administrator, and that Laffoon&#x27;s lack of personal assets and income would render him unable to post the required bond. Tupper concluded that he wished to act as executor and hire a professional fiduciary to manage the estate.

Lynne Mishele, the tenant of the house into which Heche crashed filed lawsuits against Heche&#x27;s estate, seeking &quot;compensatory damages&quot; of $2 million.

In November 2022, the court appointed Homer Heche Laffoon as general administrator of his mother&#x27;s estate. In early 2024, Laffoon stated the estate cannot pay its debt of over $6 million, including the $2 million in damages sought by Mishele.

<doc id="320787" wikidata="Q212055" url="?curid=320787" title="Black guillemot">
<text>The black guillemot or tystie (Cepphus grylle) is a medium-sized seabird of the Alcidae family, native throughout northern Atlantic coasts and eastern North American coasts. It is resident in much of its range, but large populations from the high arctic migrate southwards in winter. The bird can be seen in and around its breeding habitat of rocky shores, cliffs and islands in single or smalls groups of pairs. They feed mainly by diving towards the sea floor feeding on fish, crustaceans or other benthic invertebrates. They are listed on the IUCN red list as a species of least concern.

Both sexes have very similar appearances with black plumage and a large white patch on the upper side of their wings in summer. The bill is also black, being rather long and slender, while the feet are coral-red. In winter adult underparts are white and the upperparts are a pale grey with the back and shoulders exhibiting barred light grey and white patterning.

The birds breed in solitary pairs or small groups during their breeding season starting in late February and early May. Pairs nest above the high tide mark, usually in cliff crevices or gaps in boulders. Many pairs lack true nests and lay directly on the ground. Breeding pairs will typically lay 2-egg clutches and raise 2 chicks to fledging. Eggs are a dull white to pale green in color, boldly marked with dark spots and blotches. Incubation by both parents typically lasts 28 to 32 days. Once hatched, chicks are covered with black down and receive care from the parents until they fledge aged 30 – 40 days, unaccompanied by their parents. Once fledged, chicks are totally independent and by age three or four years they will begin to re-join their natal colony.

==Taxonomy==
The black guillemot was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other auks in the genus &quot;Alca&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Alca grylle&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as the Ocean of northern Europe but this has subsequently been restricted to Sweden. The black guillemot is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Cepphus&quot; that was introduced in 1769 by the Prussian naturalist Peter Pallas. The genus name &quot;Cepphus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;kepphos&quot;, a pale waterbird mentioned by Greek authors including Aristotle. The species name &quot;grylle&quot; was the local dialect name for this bird in Gotland at the time of Linnaeus&#x27;s visit there in 1741. The English word &quot;guillemot&quot; is from French &quot;guillemot&quot; probably derived from &quot;Guillaume&quot;, &quot;William&quot;.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. g. mandtii&quot; (Lichtenstein, MHC, 1822) – high Arctic coasts: west, east Greenland, Jan Mayen (northeast of Iceland), Svalbard (north of Norway), north Siberia and north Alaska, northeast Canada to north Labrador
* &quot;C. g. arcticus&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1824) – low Arctic to north temperate coasts: south Greenland, northwest British Isles, south Scandinavia, and the White Sea (northwest Russia), south Labrador and Newfoundland (southeast Canada) and Gulf of Maine
* &quot;C. g. islandicus&quot; Hørring, 1937 – coastal Iceland
* &quot;C. g. faeroeensis&quot; Brehm, CL, 1831 – Faroe Islands
* &quot;C. g. grylle&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – coastal Baltic Sea

==Description==
The black guillemot is a medium-sized bird with adults normally in length and with wingspans of . The bodyweight can range from . Adults have both summer and winter plumage and there is no sexual difference in this that can be identified in the field. The English common name “Black Guillemot” references their strikingly black breeding summer plumage which is totally black except for a large white patch on the upper side of their wings. During the summer plumage, their legs, feet and inside of the mouth are all a bright coral-red, and their beak is a black. Adults lose their summer plumage in an early fall moult where their upper plumage become barred with light grey and white, their head is a pale grey, their underparts white, and legs and feet a pale red. They retain their white wing patch, black beak and red inside their mouth. The call in the breeding season is a high whistle. The red gape is also prominent then.

Juveniles and immatures can easily be identified by the spotting of the white wing patch with grey or brown feathers and is easy to see even at far distances in the field.


==Distribution and habitat==

The black guillemot is a circumpolar species distributed in the boreal, low arctic and high arctic regions of the north Atlantic and arctic oceans and breeding between 43° and 82°N. The 5 listed subspecies inhabit different parts of this range. In North America, they can be found as far south as the Gulf of Maine and New England and across parts of the northern coast of North America as far as Alaska, where they are replaced by the pigeon guillemot in the North Pacific. In Europe and Asia, they are found from the British Isles and Northward across the northern coast of Asia. They are one of the few birds to breed on Surtsey, Iceland, a new volcanic island. It is a fairly common breeding bird in western and northern Scotland and Ireland. In Great Britain, they only breed at St. Bees Head in Cumbria, the Isle of Man and on east Anglesey in north Wales. Approximately 40% of the population breeds in the high arctic where the largest colonies are found, 30% in the low arctic, and 30% in boreal waters. In the winter, some of the birds in the high arctic waters are forced south by the winter ice making them seasonal migrants, but in more temperate zones the species is essentially resident.

Typically restricted to rocky shores, black guillemots utilize the cliffs, crevices and boulders for their nests, hunting the inshore waters for benthic prey. Compared to other auks, they forage fairly close to the colony, in the breeding season mostly in inshore waters more than 50m in depth, farther afield in the winter months.

==Behaviour==
One of the early ornithologists that described aspects of the behaviour of the black guillemot was Edmund Selous (1857–1934) in his book &quot;The Bird Watcher in the Shetlands&quot; (1905). In the chapter titled &#x27;From the Edge of a Precipice&#x27; he writes for instance that sometimes the black guillemots carry a fish they have caught in their beak for hours. He also gives further details about the behaviour.

Black guillemots are coastal foragers with diets typically associated with benthic and kelp-forest prey. They dive between 15-20m to catch their prey, but can dive to a depth of at least 43m. They use their wings to propel themselves forward and their feet to steer. Small prey are swallowed underwater whole. Guillemots bring larger prey to the surface to soften in their bill before swallowing whole. Guillemots are single-prey loaders, meaning they bring single prey items back to their chicks during the chick-rearing period. This limits the spatial range that parents can forage for food, as chicks must receive a high number of energy-rich prey items throughout each day. Black guillemot diets include sculpins, butterfish, rock gunnel, northern sandlance, herring, jellyfish, mollusks, and other small crustaceans. 

== Threats ==
A number of threats face black guillemots. They have been shown to be vulnerable to several species of predators including the American mink, great skua, gulls, and the Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), as well as introduced species like the brown rat and feral cats. One large colony on an island in the Baltic Sea (approximately 2600 individuals) was wiped out by American Mink in the early 2000s. Because Black guillemots forage close to shore, they tend to be exposed to more pollution than further oceangoing seabirds.Additional sources of pressure include fisheries bycatch, habitat destruction, and climate change.

<text>Alexander Meiklejohn (; 3 February 1872 – 17 December 1964) was an English-born American philosopher, university administrator, educational reformer, and free-speech advocate, best known as president of Amherst College.

==Background==

Alexander Meiklejohn was born on 3 February 1872, in Newbold Street, Rochdale, Lancashire, England. He was of Scottish descent, and the youngest of eight sons. When he was eight, the family moved to the United States, settling in Rhode Island. Family members pooled their money to send him to school. He earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees at Brown University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa, and completed his doctorate in philosophy at Cornell in 1897. At Brown, he was a member of Theta Delta Chi.

==Career==

In 1897, Meiklejohn began teaching at Brown. In 1901, he became second dean of the university, a position he held for twelve years. The first-year advising program at Brown bears his name.

From 1912 to 1923, Meiklejohn served as president of Amherst College. His presidency ended with his forced resignation for trying to apply his reforms, and thirteen students refused their diplomas that year in protest. 

Although he was offered the presidency of other colleges, Meiklejohn proposed to open a new, experimental liberal arts college. He was unable to develop adequate funding for creating an entirely new school, but he was invited by Glenn Frank, new president of the University of Wisconsin, to create the University of Wisconsin Experimental College there, which ran from 1927 to 1932. He retired from the University of Wisconsin in 1938, having already moved to Berkeley, California. He was a cofounder of the School of Social Studies in San Francisco, an adult education program focusing on &quot;great books&quot; and American democracy. In 1965, the school became the Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Institute (MCLI), a &quot;non-governmental organization&quot; run by Ann Fagan Ginger.

In 1945, Meiklejohn was a US delegate to the founding meeting of UNESCO in London.

==Death==
Meiklejohn died at age 92 on 17 December 1964, in Berkeley, California.

==Activism==

Meiklejohn was known as an advocate of First Amendment freedoms and was a member of the National Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). He was a notable proponent of the link between freedom of speech and democracy. He argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work an informed electorate is necessary. To be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal. Eric Barendt has called the defense of free speech on the grounds of democracy &quot;probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies&quot;.

In &quot;Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC&quot;, 528 US 377 (2000), at 401, Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, wrote a concurring opinion in support of regulation. In response to protestations that such laws violate citizen&#x27;s rights to free speech, Breyer held that there were free speech arguments on both sides of the issue. He said that properly framed regulations limiting monetary contributions could substantially expand the opportunity for freedom of expression rather than limit it. He pointed out that the integrity of the electoral process needs to be maintained since that is the means by which a free society translates political advocacy into concrete political action, and that regulating the financing of political campaigns is integral to that advocacy. In doing so, Breyer cited Meiklejohn&#x27;s interpretation of the First Amendment which gives emphasis to public need rather than individual prerogative.

Meiklejohn was a supporter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

==Awards ==

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) established the Alexander Meiklejohn Freedom Award to honor his work. 

He received the Rosenberger Medal in 1959. Meiklejohn was selected by John F. Kennedy to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was presented by Lyndon B. Johnson shortly after Kennedy&#x27;s death.

<text>Eduard Haas III (1897–1989) was an Austrian businessman. In 1927, Haas developed the Pez confectionery.

==Biography==
Haas was born at Leonding near Linz in Austria-Hungary into a rich family. His grandfather was a doctor and his father Eduard Haas II owned a flourishing grocery store. 

As an adolescent, Haas patented a light baking powder mixture for Gugelhupf cakes, developed after a recipe left by his grandfather. The small &quot;Hasin&quot; powder bags soon were sold all over the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.

In the 1920s, Haas began to purchase peppermint oil from a chemist, and with it, he created in 1927 the small, flat, minty candy known as Pez (the name was coined from &quot;Pfefferminz&quot;, the German word for peppermint). Pez gradually gained popularity as an anti-smoking mint; however, Haas decided to broaden the appeal of Pez. After World War II, Haas and colleagues developed small dispensers shaped like lighters; the Pez dispenser debuted in 1947.

In 1952, Haas shifted his base to New York City where he developed a fresh marketing scheme aimed at children. The new Pez featured varying dispensers with popular figures as &quot;flaps&quot; and colored mints. To this day, Pez dispensers are sought out as collectors items.

==Death==
He died in Vienna, Austria in 1989.

<doc id="320805" wikidata="Q60806" url="?curid=320805" title="Siegfried &amp; Roy">
<text>Siegfried Fischbacher (June 13, 1939 – January 13, 2021) and Roy Horn (born Uwe Ludwig Horn; October 3, 1944 – May 8, 2020) were German-American magicians and entertainers who performed together as Siegfried &amp; Roy. They were best known for their use of white lions and white tigers in their acts.

The pair met on a cruise ship and began to perform together on ships and in European clubs and theaters. In 1967, they were invited to begin performing in Las Vegas, Nevada. Starting in 1990, they headlined a show at The Mirage casino resort. Their performing career came to an end in 2003 when Horn was critically injured by a tiger during a performance.

==Early lives==
Fischbacher and Horn were born and raised in Germany. They moved to the United States and became naturalized citizens in 1988.

===Siegfried===
Siegfried was born Siegfried Fischbacher in Rosenheim, Bavaria, Germany on June 13, 1939 to Martin and Maria Fischbacher. His mother was a housewife and his father was a professional painter who, during World War II, ended up as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. Fischbacher purchased a book about magic tricks as a child and began to practice illusions. He moved to Italy in 1956 and started work at a hotel.

===Roy===
Roy Horn was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944 in Nordenham, Oldenburg, Germany in the midst of bomb attacks to Johanna Horn. He would officially Americanize his name to Roy when becoming naturalized in 1988, but had used the name Roy for years prior. His father died in World War II, and his mother married a construction worker after the war ended. She later began work in a factory. Horn had three brothers: Manfred, Alfred, and Werner. Horn became interested in animals at a very young age and cared for his childhood dog named Hexe (meaning witch). A family friend was the founder of Bremen Zoo, which gave Horn access to exotic animals from the age of 10. Horn left school at age 13.

==Career==
The duo met on board the cruise ship TS &quot;Bremen&quot; where Horn was a waiter and Fischbacher was performing magic under the stage name Delmare. While performing on board, Fischbacher asked Horn to assist him during a show. The two were fired from the TS &quot;Bremen&quot; for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a cruise line based in New York and began performing together as a duo. 

The owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen saw Fischbacher and Horn&#x27;s act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and recruited the duo to perform at her nightclub. This launched a career for the pair on the European nightclub circuit, and they began to perform with tigers. 

They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967, where they debuted at the Folies Bergere at The Tropicana Hotel Las Vegas. The duo were originally placed 14th on a long bill, but by 1978, they had become the grand finale.

In 1981, Ken Feld of Irvin &amp; Kenneth Feld Productions started the &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; variety show with them at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino, located on the Las Vegas Strip. A revamped version of the show was taken on a world tour in the third quarter of 1988.

In 1990, Fischbacher and Horn moved their show to a newly opened casino and resort in Las Vegas, The Mirage, where they performed until 2003.

During a period of their careers, Fischbacher and Horn were romantically involved, though they avoided discussion of their private lives.

==2003 tiger incident==
During a show at the Mirage on October 3, 2003, on his 59th birthday, Horn was attacked by a seven-year-old white tiger named Mantacore (the tiger&#x27;s name having been frequently misspelled as &quot;Montecore&quot; in media reports). As part of the act, but veering off-script, Horn held the microphone to Mantacore&#x27;s mouth and told him to say &quot;hello&quot; to the audience. Mantacore responded by biting Horn&#x27;s sleeve. Horn tapped the tiger on the nose with the microphone saying &quot;no, no&quot;, and the tiger eventually released the grip, but remained fixed on Horn despite a standby trainer&#x27;s attempts to distract it with cubes of meat. Then as Horn retreated, the tiger leapt at him, swinging at his legs and knocking him off his feet. As trainers rushed to the stage to assist, Mantacore bit into Horn&#x27;s neck and dragged him offstage. Horn was finally released after trainers sprayed the tiger with CO2 from fire extinguishers and jammed their index fingers into the tiger&#x27;s mouth. Horn survived, but the attack severed his spine, resulting in massive blood loss and severely injuring other parts of his body. It left him with permanent impairment to his motor and verbal abilities. He also had a stroke either before or after Mantacore dragged him offstage. 

While en route to the hospital, Horn stated, &quot;Mantacore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Mantacore&quot;. He told &quot;People&quot; in September 2004 that Mantacore saved his life by trying to drag him to safety after he had a stroke. The incident prompted the Mirage to close the show, which had 267 cast and crew members. The trainer, Chris Lawrence, later contradicted Fischbacher and Horn&#x27;s explanations for why the tiger attacked Horn, alleging it was due to Horn&#x27;s mishandling of Mantacore. The duo dismissed Lawrence&#x27;s claims, stating he &quot;had problems with his life anyway&quot;. Lawrence later said he believed that the duo and the Mirage covered up the real reason for the attack to protect their image.

==Aftermath and retirement==

In August 2004, Siegfried &amp; Roy&#x27;s act became the basis for &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;, an animated sitcom about a lion who performs in their show and is head of a family of lions. Shortly before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Fischbacher and Horn urged NBC to continue production after Horn&#x27;s medical condition had improved. By March 2006, Horn was talking and walking, with assistance from Fischbacher, and appeared on Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s television news program &quot;The Insider&quot; to discuss his daily rehabilitation.

In February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Mantacore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute (though Chris Lawrence had stated this performance involved a different tiger). Their performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; program. On April 23, 2010, Fischbacher and Horn retired from show business. &quot;The last time we closed, we didn&#x27;t have a lot of warning,&quot; said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. &quot;This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence.&quot; On March 19, 2014, Mantacore died after a brief illness. He was 17 years old. In June 2016, director Philipp Stölzl announced that Fischbacher and Horn would produce a biographical film documenting their lives.

===Illnesses and deaths===
On April 28, 2020, Horn&#x27;s publicist stated that Horn had &quot;tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and is currently responding well to treatment.&quot; His condition deteriorated, and he died ten days later on May 8, at age 75 while at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada. The duo&#x27;s spokesman, Dave Kirvin, announced Horn&#x27;s death, saying it was due to complications from the disease. Fischbacher stated that &quot;the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend.&quot; 

On January 11, 2021, it was reported that Fischbacher had terminal pancreatic cancer. He died at his North Las Vegas home two days later at age 81.

<doc id="320809" wikidata="Q3878987" url="?curid=320809" title="Nova Express">
<text>Nova Express is a 1964 novel by American author William S. Burroughs. It was written using the &#x27;fold-in&#x27; method, a version of the cut-up method, developed by Burroughs with Brion Gysin, of enfolding snippets of different texts into the novel. It is part of The Nova Trilogy, or &quot;Cut-Up Trilogy&#x27;, together with &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; and &quot;The Ticket That Exploded&quot;. Burroughs considered the trilogy a &quot;sequel&quot; or &quot;mathematical&quot; continuation of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.

&quot;Nova Express&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1965. It is listed in David Pringle&#x27;s 1985 book &quot;Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels&quot;.

In 2014, Grove Press published a &quot;Restored Text&quot; edition, edited by Oliver Harris, which included a number of corrections and added an introduction and extensive notes. The introduction argued for the care with which Burroughs used his methods and established the text&#x27;s complex manuscript histories.

== Interpretation ==

&quot;Nova Express&quot; is a social commentary on human and machine control of life. The Nova Mob—Sammy the Butcher, Green Tony, Iron Claws, The Brown Artist, Jacky Blue Note, Limestone John, Izzy the Push, Hamburger Mary, Paddy The Sting, The Subliminal Kid, Blue Dinosaur, Mr. and Mrs. D —are viruses, &quot;defined as the three-dimensional coordinate point of a controller&quot; ... &quot;which invade the human body and in the process produce language.&quot; These Nova Criminals represent society, culture, and government, and have taken control by the use of word and image. Inspector Lee and the rest of the Nova Police are left fighting for the rest of humanity in the power struggle. &quot;The Nova Police can be compared to apomorphine, a regulating instance that need not continue and has no intention of continuing after its work is done.&quot; The police are focused on &quot;first-order addictions of junkies, homosexuals, dissidents, and criminals; if these criminals vanish, the police must create more in order to justify their own survival.&quot; The Nova Police depend upon the Nova Criminals for existence; if the criminals cease to exist, so do the police. &quot;They act like apomorphine, the nonaddictive cure for morphine addiction that Burroughs used and then promoted for many years.&quot;

Control is the main theme of the novel, and Burroughs attempts to use language to break down the walls of culture, the biggest control machine. He uses Inspector Lee to express his own thoughts about the world. &quot;The purpose of my writing is to expose and arrest Nova Criminals. In &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, &quot;Soft Machine&quot; and &quot;Nova Express&quot; I show who they are and what they are doing and what they will do if they are not arrested. [...] With your help we can occupy The Reality Studio and retake their universe of Fear Death and Monopoly.&quot; As Burroughs battles with the self, what is human, and what is &quot;reality&quot;, he finds that language is the only way to maintain dominance over the &quot;powerful instruments of control&quot;, which are the most prevalent enemies of human society.

==Reception==
While &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; was an initial shock to the literary community, &quot;Nova Express&quot; was considered the end of Burroughs&#x27;s stylistic experiment and of the Nova Trilogy. The novel received more praise on its own, as it was often compared to the other books in the trilogy and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Eric Mottram stated that although &quot;Burroughs&#x27;s repetitive narcotic and homoerotic fantasies become tedious in sections of his third novel ... it is from these obsessions that his most powerful work develops.&quot;

Reviewing the novel for a genre audience, Judith Merril compared &quot;Nova Express&quot; to &quot;the surreality of certain dreams, or the intense fascination of a confusion of new impressions in real life.&quot;

<doc id="320818" wikidata="Q2557585" url="?curid=320818" title="Saad Haddad">
<text>Saad Haddad (; 1936 – 14 January 1984) was a Lebanese military officer and the founder and head of the South Lebanon Army (SLA) during the Lebanese Civil War. Originally a Major in the Lebanese Army, he defected and formed the SLA and created the separatist State of Free Lebanon backed by Israel. For years Haddad closely collaborated with and received arms and political support from Israel against Lebanese government forces, Hezbollah, and the Syrian Army. Haddad died of cancer in his house in Marjayoun.

==Early life==
Haddad was born to a Greek Catholic family in Marjayoun. He received part of his training at Fort Benning in the United States.

==Lebanese Civil War==
During the 1970s, there was a cyclical pattern of guerrilla attacks carried out by Palestinian militants on Israel and by the Israel Defense Forces on Palestinian targets in Lebanon. After the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, Lebanese-generated security concerns grew for Israel. At the same time, the breakdown of Lebanon&#x27;s central government provided opportunities for Israel to act. Around 1975, Israel sponsored the creation of a surrogate force, Lebanese Christian (Melkite) Major Saad Haddad was the first officer to defect from the Lebanese Army to ally himself with Israel, a defection which led to the formation of the pro-Israel Free Lebanon Army, based in a corridor, the &quot;Security Zone&quot; along Lebanon&#x27;s southern border from 1982 after Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon. This force, which called itself the Free Lebanon Army (but was later renamed the South Lebanon Army (SLA) under leader Antoine Lahad in May 1980), was intended to prevent infiltration into Israel of Palestinian guerrillas. In 1978, Israel invaded Lebanon, clearing out Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) strongholds as far north as the Litani River.

On 18 April 1979, Haddad proclaimed the area controlled by his force Independent Free Lebanon. The following day, he was branded a traitor to the Lebanese government and officially dismissed from the Lebanese Army. 

Another consequence of the Israeli invasion was the establishment in southern Lebanon of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, whose mission was to separate the various combatants. Haddad&#x27;s militia collaborated with Israel and received the bulk of its arms, equipment, supplies and ordnance from Israel. There are eyewitness accounts that support the claim that Saad Haddad&#x27;s troops were involved in the massacres of Sabra and Shatila in 1982. In the massacre an estimated 763 - 3,500 civilians were killed. Though Hadad and his men were exonerated by an Israeli panel, the SLA was still known to engage in ruthless behavior, such as the &quot;brutal conditions&quot; of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners at the infamous al-Khiam prison. 

During the last few years of his life, Saad Haddad headed the Christian radio station &quot;Voice of Hope&quot;, initially set up and funded by George Otis of High Adventure Ministries. The Voice of Hope was set up as a charitable endeavor to help the Christian enclave in Southern Lebanon, but it quickly became politicized when Haddad used it for political diatribes aimed at his many enemies. High Adventure billed it as the only privately owned radio station in the Middle East that was broadcasting the Gospel, but its message was often tainted by the necessary affiliation with Haddad&#x27;s militia, as its operation depended upon his protection and authority, resulting in a very curious blend of scripture lessons and political commentary which the staff at the station could not control or regulate.

In 1984, Haddad died of cancer. His successor as the head of the SLA was general Antoine Lahad.

==Legacy==
A statue of Haddad was erected in his hometown of Marjayoun. The statue was torn down in May 2000 by Hezbollah following Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from South Lebanon and the collapse of the South Lebanese Army.

==Descendants==
On 7 June 2012, Lebanese daily newspaper &quot;As Safir&quot; reported on the progress of Saad Haddad&#x27;s daughter Arza (meaning &quot;Cedar Tree&quot; in Arabic) (born 1980 or 1981) as a researcher in ballistics and rocket science at the Technion University in Haifa. She obtained a master&#x27;s degree in aeronautics in June 2012.

<doc id="320819" wikidata="Q938883" url="?curid=320819" title="Cantor function">
<text>In mathematics, the Cantor function is an example of a function that is continuous, but not absolutely continuous. It is a notorious counterexample in analysis, because it challenges naive intuitions about continuity, derivative, and measure. Though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative almost everywhere, its value still goes from 0 to 1 as its argument reaches from 0 to 1. Thus, in one sense the function seems very much like a constant one which cannot grow, and in another, it does indeed monotonically grow.

It is also called the Cantor ternary function, the Lebesgue function, Lebesgue&#x27;s singular function, the Cantor–Vitali function, the Devil&#x27;s staircase, the Cantor staircase function, and the Cantor–Lebesgue function. introduced the Cantor function and mentioned that Scheeffer pointed out that it was a counterexample to an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus claimed by Harnack. The Cantor function was discussed and popularized by , and .

==Definition==

To define the Cantor function formula_1, let formula_2 be any number in formula_3 and obtain formula_4 by the following steps:

#Express formula_2 in base 3, using digits 0, 1, 2. 
#If the base-3 representation of formula_2 contains a 1, replace every digit strictly after the first 1 with 0.
#Replace any remaining 2s with 1s.
#Interpret the result as a binary number. The result is formula_4.

For example:
*formula_8 has the ternary representation 0.02020202... There are no 1s so the next stage is still 0.02020202... This is rewritten as 0.01010101... This is the binary representation of formula_9, so formula_10.
*formula_11 has the ternary representation 0.01210121... The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.01000000... This is not rewritten since it has no 2s. This is the binary representation of formula_8, so formula_13.
*formula_14 has the ternary representation 0.21102 (or 0.211012222...). The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.21. This is rewritten as 0.11. This is the binary representation of formula_15, so formula_16.

Equivalently, if formula_17 is the Cantor set on [0,1], then the Cantor function formula_1 can be defined as

formula_19

This formula is well-defined, since every member of the Cantor set has a &quot;unique&quot; base 3 representation that only contains the digits 0 or 2. (For some members of formula_17, the ternary expansion is repeating with trailing 2&#x27;s and there is an alternative non-repeating expansion ending in 1. For example, formula_9 = 0.13 = 0.02222...3 is a member of the Cantor set). Since formula_22 and formula_23, and formula_24 is monotonic on formula_17, it is clear that formula_26 also holds for all formula_27.

==Properties==
The Cantor function challenges naive intuitions about continuity and measure; though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative almost everywhere, formula_28 goes from 0 to 1 as formula_29 goes from 0 to 1, and takes on every value in between. The Cantor function is the most frequently cited example of a real function that is uniformly continuous (precisely, it is Hölder continuous of exponent &quot;α&quot; = log 2/log 3) but not absolutely continuous. It is constant on intervals of the form (0.&quot;x&quot;1&quot;x&quot;2&quot;x&quot;3...&quot;x&quot;n022222..., 0.&quot;x&quot;1&quot;x&quot;2&quot;x&quot;3...&quot;x&quot;n200000...), and every point not in the Cantor set is in one of these intervals, so its derivative is 0 outside of the Cantor set. On the other hand, it has no derivative at any point in an uncountable subset of the Cantor set containing the interval endpoints described above.

The Cantor function can also be seen as the cumulative probability distribution function of the 1/2-1/2 Bernoulli measure &quot;μ&quot; supported on the Cantor set: formula_30. This probability distribution, called the Cantor distribution, has no discrete part. That is, the corresponding measure is atomless. This is why there are no jump discontinuities in the function; any such jump would correspond to an atom in the measure.

However, no non-constant part of the Cantor function can be represented as an integral of a probability density function; integrating any putative probability density function that is not almost everywhere zero over any interval will give positive probability to some interval to which this distribution assigns probability zero. In particular, as pointed out, the function is not the integral of its derivative even though the derivative exists almost everywhere.

The Cantor function is the standard example of a singular function.

The Cantor function is also a standard example of a function with bounded variation but, as mentioned above, is not absolutely continuous. However, every absolutely continuous function is continuous with bounded variation. 

The Cantor function is non-decreasing, and so in particular its graph defines a rectifiable curve. showed that the arc length of its graph is 2. Note that the graph of any nondecreasing function such that formula_31 and formula_32 has length not greater than 2. In this sense, the Cantor function is extremal.

===Lack of absolute continuity===
Because the Lebesgue measure of the uncountably infinite Cantor set is 0, for any positive &quot;ε&quot; &lt; 1 and &quot;δ&quot;, there exists a finite sequence of pairwise disjoint sub-intervals with total length &lt; &quot;δ&quot; over which the Cantor function cumulatively rises more than &quot;ε&quot;.

In fact, for every &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0 there are finitely many pairwise disjoint intervals (&quot;xk&quot;,&quot;yk&quot;) (1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;M&quot;) with formula_33 and formula_34.

== Alternative definitions ==

=== Iterative construction ===
Below we define a sequence {&quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;} of functions on the unit interval that converges to the Cantor function.

Let &quot;f&quot;0(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;.

Then, for every integer , the next function &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;x&quot;) will be defined in terms of &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) as follows:

Let &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;x&quot;) = ,  when ;

Let &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;x&quot;) = 1/2,  when ;

Let &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1(&quot;x&quot;) = ,  when .

The three definitions are compatible at the end-points 1/3 and 2/3, because &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;(0) = 0 and &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;(1) = 1 for every &quot;n&quot;, by induction. One may check that &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges pointwise to the Cantor function defined above. Furthermore, the convergence is uniform. Indeed, separating into three cases, according to the definition of &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1, one sees that

:formula_35

If &quot;f&quot; denotes the limit function, it follows that, for every &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0,

:formula_36

=== Fractal volume ===
The Cantor function is closely related to the Cantor set. The Cantor set &quot;C&quot; can be defined as the set of those numbers in the interval [0, 1] that do not contain the digit 1 in their base-3 (triadic) expansion, except if the 1 is followed by zeros only (in which case the tail 1000formula_37 can be replaced by 0222formula_37 to get rid of any 1). It turns out that the Cantor set is a fractal with (uncountably) infinitely many points (zero-dimensional volume), but zero length (one-dimensional volume). Only the &quot;D&quot;-dimensional volume formula_39 (in the sense of a Hausdorff-measure) takes a finite value, where formula_40 is the fractal dimension of &quot;C&quot;. We may define the Cantor function alternatively as the &quot;D&quot;-dimensional volume of sections of the Cantor set

: formula_41

==Self-similarity==
The Cantor function possesses several symmetries. For formula_42, there is a reflection symmetry 
:formula_43
and a pair of magnifications, one on the left and one on the right:
:formula_44
and
:formula_45
The magnifications can be cascaded; they generate the dyadic monoid. This is exhibited by defining several helper functions. Define the reflection as
:formula_46
The first self-symmetry can be expressed as
:formula_47
where the symbol formula_48 denotes function composition. That is, formula_49 and likewise for the other cases. For the left and right magnifications, write the left-mappings
:formula_50 and formula_51
Then the Cantor function obeys
:formula_52
Similarly, define the right mappings as
:formula_53 and formula_54
Then, likewise, 
:formula_55
The two sides can be mirrored one onto the other, in that
:formula_56
and likewise,
:formula_57
These operations can be stacked arbitrarily. Consider, for example, the sequence of left-right moves formula_58 Adding the subscripts C and D, and, for clarity, dropping the composition operator formula_48 in all but a few places, one has:
:formula_60
Arbitrary finite-length strings in the letters L and R correspond to the dyadic rationals, in that every dyadic rational can be written as both formula_61 for integer &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; and as finite length of bits formula_62 with formula_63 Thus, every dyadic rational is in one-to-one correspondence with some self-symmetry of the Cantor function.

Some notational rearrangements can make the above slightly easier to express. Let formula_64 and formula_65 stand for L and R. Function composition extends this to a monoid, in that one can write formula_66 and generally, formula_67 for some binary strings of digits &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;AB&quot; is just the ordinary concatenation of such strings. The dyadic monoid &quot;M&quot; is then the monoid of all such finite-length left-right moves. Writing formula_68 as a general element of the monoid, there is a corresponding self-symmetry of the Cantor function:
:formula_69

The dyadic monoid itself has several interesting properties. It can be viewed as a finite number of left-right moves down an infinite binary tree; the infinitely distant &quot;leaves&quot; on the tree correspond to the points on the Cantor set, and so, the monoid also represents the self-symmetries of the Cantor set. In fact, a large class of commonly occurring fractals are described by the dyadic monoid; additional examples can be found in the article on de Rham curves. Other fractals possessing self-similarity are described with other kinds of monoids. The dyadic monoid is itself a sub-monoid of the modular group formula_70

Note that the Cantor function bears more than a passing resemblance to Minkowski&#x27;s question-mark function. In particular, it obeys the exact same symmetry relations, although in an altered form.

== Generalizations ==
Let

: formula_71

be the dyadic (binary) expansion of the real number 0 ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ 1 in terms of binary digits &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; ∈ {0,1}. This expansion is discussed in greater detail in the article on the dyadic transformation. Then consider the function

: formula_72

For &quot;z&quot; = 1/3, the inverse of the function &quot;x&quot; = 2 &quot;C&quot;1/3(&quot;y&quot;) is the Cantor function. That is, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the Cantor function. In general, for any &quot;z&quot; &lt; 1/2, &quot;C&quot;&quot;z&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) looks like the Cantor function turned on its side, with the width of the steps getting wider as &quot;z&quot; approaches zero.

As mentioned above, the Cantor function is also the cumulative distribution function of a measure on the Cantor set. Different Cantor functions, or Devil&#x27;s Staircases, can be obtained by considering different atom-less probability measures supported on the Cantor set or other fractals. While the Cantor function has derivative 0 almost everywhere, current research focuses on the question of the size of the set of points where the upper right derivative is distinct from the lower right derivative, causing the derivative to not exist. This analysis of differentiability is usually given in terms of fractal dimension, with the Hausdorff dimension the most popular choice. This line of research was started in the 1990s by Darst, who showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of non-differentiability of the Cantor function is the square of the dimension of the Cantor set, formula_73. Subsequently Falconer showed that this squaring relationship holds for all Ahlfors&#x27;s regular, singular measures, i.e.formula_74Later, Troscheit obtain a more comprehensive picture of the set where the derivative does not exist for more general normalized Gibb&#x27;s measures supported on self-conformal and self-similar sets.

Hermann Minkowski&#x27;s question mark function loosely resembles the Cantor function visually, appearing as a &quot;smoothed out&quot; form of the latter; it can be constructed by passing from a continued fraction expansion to a binary expansion, just as the Cantor function can be constructed by passing from a ternary expansion to a binary expansion. The question mark function has the interesting property of having vanishing derivatives at all rational numbers.

<text>The Bank of Montreal (, ), abbreviated as BMO (pronounced ), is a Canadian multinational investment bank and financial services company.

The bank was founded in Montreal, Quebec, in 1817 as Montreal Bank, making it Canada&#x27;s oldest bank. In 2023, the company’s seat in the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000 was 84. Its head office is in Montreal and its operational headquarters and executive offices are located in Toronto, Ontario, since 1977. It is commonly known by its ticker symbol BMO on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. In April 2024, it had CA$1.37 trillion in total assets. The Bank of Montreal swift code is BOFMCAM2 and the institution number is 001. In Canada, BMO has more than 900 branches and more than 1000 in the United States, serving over 13 million customers globally.

In the United States, BMO does business as BMO Financial Group, where it has substantial operations in the Chicago area and elsewhere in the country, where it operates &quot;BMO Bank, N.A.&quot;. BMO Capital Markets is BMO&#x27;s investment and corporate banking division, while the wealth management division is branded as BMO Nesbitt Burns. On 12 December 2021, the Bank of Montreal announced the strategic acquisition of Bank of the West from BNP Paribas for US$16.3 billion.

==History==
===19th century===
The bank was established on 23 June 1817 when a group of merchants signed the Articles of Association, formally creating the &quot;Montreal Bank&quot;. The signors of the document include Robert Armour, John C. Bush, Austin Cuvillier, George Garden, Horatio Gates, James Leslie, George Moffatt, John Richardson, and Thomas A. Turner. The bank was first located in rooms rented on Rue Saint-Paul, Montreal, before moving to its permanent building on Rue Saint-Paul in 1818. In the same year, the bank opened its first branch in Quebec City; and several offices in Upper Canada, including Amherstburg, Kingston, Perth, and York (present day Toronto). The bank also opened its first foreign permanent office in 1818, opening an office in Willam Street in New York City.

By 1822, the bank converted from the status it had held since its founding as a private company owned by a small group of people into a public company owned by 144. At this time, it became officially known by its current name.
Expansion into Upper Canada was halted in 1824, after legislation from the Parliament of Upper Canada forbade bank branches whose head offices were not based in Upper Canada from operating. In 1838, the bank reentered the Upper Canadian market with the purchase of the Bank of the People, a bank based in Toronto. BMO was permitted to open its own branches in the area, after Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united to create the Province of Canada in 1841. Shortly after the two colonies merged, the bank opened branches into Cobourg, Belleville, Brockville, and Ottawa.

Expansion into the Maritimes and Western Canada was facilitated following Canadian Confederation. In 1877, the bank opened its first branch in Western Canada, with the opening of a branch in Winnipeg. New branches were also opened in the Maritimes, in Halifax, Moncton, and Saint John completed shortly after Confederation. The Bank of Montreal established branches in Newfoundland Colony on 31 January 1895, at the behest of the colonial government. The colonial government of Newfoundland made the request to the Bank of Montreal four days after the collapse of the Commercial Bank and Union Bank of Newfoundland on 10 December 1894.

===20th century===
By 1907, the bank had branches in every province of Atlantic Canada, with the opening of a branch in Charlottetown. Expansion into the Maritimes was further facilitated with the acquisition of the Exchange Bank of Yarmouth in 1903, the People&#x27;s Bank of Halifax in 1905, and the People&#x27;s Bank of New Brunswick in 1906.

The early 20th century also saw the bank acquire several financial institutions that helped increase its presence in Newfoundland, and areas west of Quebec, including the Ontario Bank in 1906, the Bank of British North America in 1918, and the Merchants Bank of Canada in 1921. During this period, the bank also acquired the Montreal-based Molson Bank in 1925.

In 1942, the bank ended production of its own bank notes, which were in circulation in Canada since 1871. By 1944, the central bank of the country, the Bank of Canada became the sole issuer of currency in Canada, and notes from private banks were withdrawn.

In 1960, the Bank of Montreal moved its operational headquarters to a seventeen-storey structure next to its historic head office. The building served as the bank&#x27;s operational headquarters until 1977, when it was moved to First Canadian Place on Bay Street in Toronto in 1977. The structure was named after the bank&#x27;s slogan at the time, &quot;The First Canadian Bank&quot;, which was introduced in 1969, and was prominent in much of the bank&#x27;s advertising during the 1970&#x27;s, most notably in television commercials featuring Canadian actor Leslie Nielsen. The bank&#x27;s present &quot;M-Bar&quot; logo was also introduced during this time, in 1967. However, the bank&#x27;s legal headquarters remains at the historic Montreal head office, with First Canadian Place formally listed as the &quot;executive office&quot; of the bank.

In 1984, the bank acquired Chicago-based Harris Bank (through its parent, Harris Bankcorp), later rebranded as BMO Harris Bank. In 1987, the bank acquired stock brokerage Nesbitt, Thomson and Company. Several years later, the bank assumed control of two retail branches formerly belonging to the Standard Chartered Bank of Canada.

In 1994, the Bank of Montreal became the first Canadian bank to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1995, the bank opened its first branch in Guangzhou, formally receiving a license to operate the branch on 20 November 1996. In doing so the bank became the first Canadian bank to receive a license to operate in China. During the 1990s, BMO acquired a number of other banks in the Chicago area, merging them under the Harris Bank name, including Suburban Bancorp in 1994; and Household Bank in 1999.

In 1998, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada announced they had agreed to a merger pending approval from the government. Government regulators later blocked the proposed merger, along with a similar proposal by the Toronto-Dominion Bank to merge with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Although the banks did not merge, in 2000, the Bank of Montreal, together with the Royal Bank of Canada, merged their merchant payment processor businesses to form Moneris Solutions.

===21st century===
In 2006, BMO bought BCPBank, a Schedule C financial institution that was the Canadian division of Banco Comercial Português. In 2008, a Bank of Montreal trader pleaded guilty to intentionally mismarking his trading book in order to increase his bonus from the bank.

In 2009, BMO purchased AIG&#x27;s Canadian life insurance business, AIG Life Insurance Company of Canada (400,000 customers and 300 employees), for approximately CA$330 million, making BMO the second-biggest life insurer among Canadian banks. The new component was renamed BMO Life Assurance Company. In the same year, the Bank of Montreal acquired the Diners Club International&#x27;s North American franchise from Citibank. The transaction gave BMO exclusive rights to issue Diners cards in the US and Canada.

In October 2010, the bank became the first Canadian bank to incorporate in China, with branches in China operating as BMO ChinaCo. In December 2010, BMO announced the purchase of Milwaukee-based Marshall &amp; Ilsley, and was later amalgamated with its Harris Bank operations. When the transaction completed, M&amp;I Bank, along with current Harris Bank branches were rebranded BMO Harris Bank. In 2022, BMO booked US$834 million after being found liable for Marshall &amp; Ilsley Bank Ponzi scheme with damages of US$550 million. In 2009, businessman Thomas Petters was found guilty of running the scheme using an account at Marshall &amp; Ilsley between 2002 and 2008. When BMO bought Marshall &amp; Ilsley and assumed the liability. In 2014, the bank acquired London-based Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, later re-branding it as BMO Commercial Property Trust in 2019. In September 2015, BMO agreed to acquire General Electric Co. subsidiary GE Capital&#x27;s transportation-finance unit. The business acquired has US$8.7 billion (CA$11.5 billion) of assets, 600 employees and 15 offices in the US and Canada.

BMO and Simplii Financial (a subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) were the targets of hackers in May 2018, who claimed to have compromised the systems of both banks and stolen information on a combined 90,000 customers (50,000 from BMO). An email sent from a Russian address and attributed to the hackers demanded a ransom of 1 million from each company paid via Ripple by 11:59 pm on 28 May 2018 or the information would be released on &quot;fraud forum and fraud community&quot;.

In 2018, BMO went into the marijuana sector with a $175 million deal for a stake in a producer. It was the first investment in the sector by a &quot;Big Five Canadian bank&quot;. In January 2018, the bank was accused in a lawsuit along with five other Canadian banks for &quot;conspiring to rig a Canadian rate benchmark to improve profits from derivatives trading&quot;.

After resigning from the Canadian Liberal cabinet, Scott Brison was hired by the bank as its vice-chair of investment and corporate banking in February 2019. In February 2019, it became reported that its US retail profits had surged. The bank moved its New York City headquarters in April 2019, to a former Conde Nast building. That month, the bank&#x27;s Irish subsidiary was fined several million for a license breach. To settle charges by the SEC that it hid conflicts of interest from clients in 2016, in September 2019 the Bank of Montreal&#x27;s two units in Chicago paid $38 million. In December 2019, the bank cut 2,300 jobs, after a drop in quarterly earnings, effecting around five percent of the workforce.

The company had plans to &quot;double indigenous lending&quot; in September 2019. There was controversy and protests in January 2020 after a12-year-old First Nations girl and her grandfather were handcuffed by police at a Vancouver branch of the bank following an identification discrepancy. The Vancouver mayor criticized the bank for what he termed giving false information to the police. The police were afterwards investigated. A human rights claim was later filed in response to the incident. A settlement was eventually reached, which included an undisclosed monetary payment to the victims, an apology ceremony in Bella Bella, territorial acknowledgement plaques installed at certain branches and BMO updating internal policies and procedures for how status cards are handled. After the incident, BMO launched an Indigenous Advisory Council with Indigenous members from a number of provinces.

The CEO of the bank argued against fossil fuel divestment in March 2020, after it &quot;acquired $3 billion of energy loans from Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE in 2018&quot;. In 2021, BMO signed the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) with the goal to reach global net-zero climate targets as well as net-zero financed emissions in their lending by 2050. In July 2022, BMO acquired Calgary-based Radicle Group Inc., an adviser to companies on sustainability and measuring carbon emissions.

In December 2021, BMO agreed to acquire San Francisco-based Bank of the West from BNP Paribas, with the intent of merging it with BMO Harris Bank, which would at least double BMO&#x27;s total presence in the United States. BMO&#x27;s acquisition of Bank of the West was completed in February 2023, and the Bank of the West brand is planned to be absorbed into the BMO brand by September 2023.

In January 2024, BMO became the first new member of the club of United Kingdom Bond dealers in 10 years, becoming one of the primary-dealer banks that buy bonds directly from the government. By buying bonds directly from the government, banks help create a liquid market for government debt, but they also have to hold additional capital as insurance against possible losses. In 2013, the number of primary bond dealers reached 21, by 2024 it had dropped to 16.

==Corporate information==

===Operations===
BMO is divided into three &quot;client groups&quot; which serve different markets. Each of the client groups operates under multiple brand names.
* Personal and Commercial Client Group (retail banking), including
** BMO Bank of Montreal (commercial and retail banking in Canada), including BMO&#x27;s MasterCard credit cards; &quot;BMO Life&quot;, a life insurance company; and the former virtual bank division 
** BMO USA (commercial and retail banking in the United States, headquartered in Chicago)
* Investment Banking Group (known as BMO Capital Markets)
* Private Client Group (wealth management), including
** (full service investing in Canada): formed following 1987 acquisition of Nesbitt Thomson, then one of Canada&#x27;s oldest investment houses, and the 1994 acquisition of Burns Fry, a dealer of Canadian equities and debt securities. Nesbitt Thomson and Burns Fry then merged to become BMO Nesbitt Burns.
** BMO InvestorLine (self-service investing in Canada)
** BMO Harris Investor Services (advisory services in the United States)
** BMO Private Banking (private banking in Canada and the United States) including Harris myCFO and Cedar Street Advisors (both affiliates of BMO Harris Bank) In 2014–2015 BMO rebranded BMO Harris Private Bank as BMO Private Bank.
In October 2008, Mediacorp Canada Inc. named BMO Financial Group one of Greater Toronto&#x27;s Top Employers.

==Notable buildings==

A number of late-19th century Bank of Montreal branches were also built by British architect, Andrew Taylor.

Buildings that formerly housed a branch of the bank have also seen later notable use. A branch in Montreal has been designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1990. The building was completed in 1894, and was designated as a historic site as a good example of Queen Anne Revival architecture. Another former Bank of Montreal branch on Front and Yonge Streets in Toronto has housed the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1993. The 1885 Beaux-Arts styled building designed by the Toronto firm of Darling &amp; Curry.

===Headquarters===
Completed in 1847, the Bank of Montreal Head Office is formally located in Montreal, on Saint Jacques Street. However in 1960, the operational headquarters was moved to a 17-storey tower adjacent the historic head office building. In 1977, the bank&#x27;s operational headquarters or &quot;executive office&quot;, was moved to First Canadian Place in Toronto, with the chairman, president, and some senior executives working from First Canadian Place. The structure&#x27;s was named after a historic slogan of the bank, the &quot;First Canadian Bank&quot;, a slogan introduced in 1969.

<doc id="320830" wikidata="Q318364" url="?curid=320830" title="Merce Cunningham">
<text>Mercier Philip &quot;Merce&quot; Cunningham (April 16, 1919 – July 26, 2009) was an American dancer and choreographer who was at the forefront of American modern dance for more than 50 years. He frequently collaborated with artists of other disciplines, including musicians John Cage, David Tudor, Brian Eno, and graphic artists Robert Rauschenberg, Bruce Nauman, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, and Jasper Johns; and fashion designer Rei Kawakubo. Works that he produced with these artists had a profound impact on avant-garde art beyond the world of dance.

As a choreographer, teacher, and leader of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Cunningham had a profound influence on modern dance. Many dancers who trained with Cunningham formed their own companies. They include Paul Taylor, Remy Charlip, Viola Farber, Charles Moulton, Karole Armitage, Deborah Hay, Robert Kovich, Foofwa d&#x27;Imobilité, Kimberly Bartosik, Flo Ankah, Jan Van Dyke, Jonah Bokaer, and Alice Reyes.

In 2009, the Cunningham Dance Foundation announced the Legacy Plan, a plan for the continuation of Cunningham&#x27;s work and the celebration and preservation of his artistic legacy.

Cunningham earned some of the highest honours bestowed in the arts, including the National Medal of Arts and the MacArthur Fellowship. He also received Japan&#x27;s Praemium Imperiale and a British Laurence Olivier Award, and was named Officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in France.

Cunningham&#x27;s life and artistic vision have been the subject of numerous books, films, and exhibitions, and his works have been presented by groups including the Paris Opéra Ballet, New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, White Oak Dance Project, and London&#x27;s Rambert Dance Company.

==Biography==
Merce Cunningham was born in Centralia, Washington, in 1919, the second of three sons. Both of his brothers followed their father, Clifford D. Cunningham, into the legal profession. Cunningham first experienced dance while living in Centralia. He took a tap dance class from a local teacher, Mrs Maude Barrett, whose energy and spirit taught him to love dance. Her emphasis on precise musical timing and rhythm provided him with a clear understanding of musicality that he implemented in his later dance pieces. He attended the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, headed by Nellie Cornish, from 1937 to 1939 to study acting, but found drama&#x27;s reliance on text and miming too limiting and concrete. Cunningham preferred the ambiguous nature of dance, which gave him an outlet for exploration of movement. During this time, Martha Graham saw Cunningham dance and invited him to join her company. In 1939, Cunningham moved to New York City and danced as a soloist in the Martha Graham Dance Company for six years. He presented his first solo concert in New York in April 1944 with composer John Cage, who became his lifelong romantic partner and frequent collaborator until Cage&#x27;s death in 1992.

In the summer of 1953, as a teacher in residence at Black Mountain College, Cunningham formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.

Throughout his career, Cunningham choreographed more than 200 dances and over 800 &quot;Events&quot;, or site-specific choreographic works. In 1963 he joined with Cage to create the Walker Art Center&#x27;s first performance, instigating what would be a 25-year collaborative relationship with the Walker. In his performances, he often used the &quot;I Ching&quot; to determine the sequence of his dances and, often, dancers were not informed of the order until the night of the performance. In addition to his role as choreographer, Cunningham performed as a dancer in his company into the early 1990s.

In 1968 Cunningham published his book &quot;Changes: Notes on Choreography&quot;, edited by Francis Starr, containing various sketches of his choreography. A mural, located in Washington Hall on the campus of Centralia College, was created in honor of Cunningham.

Cunningham continued to live in New York City and lead his dance company as Artistic Director until his death. He presented his last work, a new work, &quot;Nearly Ninety&quot;, in April 2009, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, to mark his 90th birthday. Later that year he died in his home at the age of 90.

==Merce Cunningham Dance Company==
Cunningham formed Merce Cunningham Dance Company (MCDC) at Black Mountain College in 1953. Guided by its leader&#x27;s radical approach to space, time and technology, the company has forged a distinctive style, reflecting Cunningham&#x27;s technique and illuminating the near limitless possibility for human movement.

The original company included dancers Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, Marianne Preger-Simon, Paul Taylor, and Remy Charlip, and musicians John Cage and David Tudor. In 1964 the Cunningham Dance Foundation was established to support his work.

MCDC made its first international tour in 1964, visiting Europe and Asia.

From 1971 until its dissolution in 2012, the company was based in the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village; for a time Cunningham himself lived a block away at 107 Bank Street, with John Cage.

On July 20, 1999, Merce Cunningham and Mikhail Baryshnikov performed together at the New York State Theater for Cunningham&#x27;s 80th birthday.

In its later years, the company had a two-year residency at , where MCDC performed &quot;Events&quot;, Cunningham&#x27;s site-specific choreographic collages, in the galleries of Richard Serra, Dan Flavin, and Sol LeWitt, among others. In 2007, MCDC premiered &quot;XOVER&quot;, Cunningham&#x27;s final collaboration with Rauschenberg, at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. In 2009, MCDC premiered Cunningham&#x27;s newest work, &quot;Nearly Ninety&quot;, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The company concluded its farewell tour on December 31, 2011, with a performance at the Park Avenue Armory.

==Artistic philosophy==

===Collaboration===

Merce Cunningham Dance Company frequently collaborated with visual artists, architects, designers, and musicians.

Many of Cunningham&#x27;s most famous innovations were developed in collaboration with composer John Cage, his life partner. Cunningham and Cage used chance procedures to generate material, discarding many artistic traditions of narrative and form. Famously, they asserted that dance and its music should not be intentionally coordinated with one another. 

John Cage, after his death, was succeeded in the role of music director by David Tudor. After 1995, MCDC&#x27;s music director was Takehisa Kosugi. MCDC commissioned more work from contemporary composers than any other dance company. Its repertory included works by musicians ranging from Cage and Gordon Mumma to Gavin Bryars, as well as popular bands like Radiohead, Sigur Rós and Sonic Youth.

The company also collaborated with an array of visual artists and designers. Robert Rauschenberg, whose famous &quot;Combines&quot; reflect the approach he used to create décor for several MCDC&#x27;s early works, served as the company&#x27;s resident designer from 1954 through 1964. Jasper Johns followed as Artistic Advisor from 1967 until 1980, and Mark Lancaster from 1980 through 1984. The last Advisors to be appointed were William Anastasi and Dove Bradshaw in 1984. Other artists who have collaborated with MCDC include Daniel Arsham, Tacita Dean, Liz Phillips, Rei Kawakubo, Roy Lichtenstein, Bruce Nauman, Ernesto Neto, Frank Stella, Benedetta Tagliabue, and Andy Warhol.

===Chance operations===

Cunningham valued the process of a work over the product. Because of his strong interest in the creation of the choreography he used chance procedures in his work. A chance procedure means that the order of the steps or sequence is unknown until the actual performance and is decided by chance. For instance in his work &quot;Suite by Chance&quot; he used the toss of a coin to determine how to put the choreographed sequences together. Indeterminacy was another part of Cunningham&#x27;s work. Many of his pieces had sections or sequences that were rehearsed so that they could be put in any order and done at any time. Although the use of chance operations was considered an abrogation of artistic responsibility, Cunningham was thrilled by a process that arrives at works that could never have been created through traditional collaboration. This does not mean, however, that Cunningham considered every piece created in this fashion a masterpiece. Those dances that did not &quot;work&quot; were quickly dropped from the repertory, while those that did were celebrated as serendipitous discoveries.

Cunningham used &quot;non-representational&quot; choreography which simply emphasizes movement, and does not necessarily represent any historical narrative, emotional situation, or idea. Such non-representational dance appears in many styles throughout history, but was not commonly used by ballet or Martha Graham, Cunningham&#x27;s primary influences. In the use of chance procedures, Cunningham abandoned the more traditional structured form of dance. He did not believe that dance needs a beginning, middle or end.

==== Examples in works ====
In &quot;Sixteen Dances for Soloist&quot; and &quot;Company of Three&quot; (1951), Cunningham used Indeterminacy for the first time in this piece; the changing element for each show was the sequence of the sections.

In &quot;Field Dances&quot; (1963), Cunningham experimented with giving the dancer more freedom. Each dancer was given a sequence of movements with which they could do as they pleased. This included exiting and entering at will, executing it in any order and as many times as desired.

In &quot;Story&quot; (1963), Cunningham experimented with the variables of costumes and sets. Before each performance dancers chose an outfit from a pile of second-hand clothes picked out by the designer, Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg was also responsible for creating a new set for every show with items he found in the theatre.

&quot;Suite by Chance (1953)&quot; was his first work made entirely through chance procedures. Charts were created listing elements such as space, time, and positions. A coin was then tossed to determine each of these elements.

&quot;Canfield&quot; (1969) was created by using playing cards. Each movement was assigned a playing card and chosen randomly.

===Use of technology===
Cunningham&#x27;s lifelong passion for exploration and innovation made him a leader in applying new technologies to the arts. He began investigating dance on film in the 1970s, and after 1991 choreographed using the computer program LifeForms, a software made by Zella Wolofsky, Tom Calvert, and Thecla Schiphorst. Cunningham explored motion capture technology with digital artists Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar to create &quot;Hand-drawn Spaces&quot;, a three-screen animation that was commissioned by and premiered at SIGGRAPH in 1998. This led to a live dance for the stage, &quot;BIPED&quot;, for which Kaiser and Eshkar provided the projected decor. In 2008, Cunningham released his &quot;Loops&quot; choreography for the hands as motion-capture data under a Creative Commons license; this was the basis for the open-source collaboration of the same name with The OpenEnded Group.

Cunningham was one of the first choreographers to begin experimenting with film. He created an original work for the video &quot;Westbeth&quot; (1974) in collaboration with filmmaker Charles Atlas The computer program later became DanceForms and uses avatars of dancers with color-coded limbs as a platform for choreography.

In 2009, Cunningham&#x27;s interest in new media led to the creation of the behind-the-scenes webcast &quot;Mondays with Merce&quot;.

=== Perspective ===
The use of stage space also changed in Cunningham&#x27;s choreography. The &quot;front and centre&quot; spot traditionally coveted by soloists no longer exists in his works. Dance can take place on any part of the stage; it need not even be frontally oriented, but can be viewed from any angle (at performances in Cunningham&#x27;s studio, for instance, audiences are seated in an L-shaped configuration). The viewer&#x27;s focus is never directed to a particular spot; he must often decide among many centres of activity.

Merce Cunningham saw randomness and arbitrariness as positive qualities because they exist in real life.
Most of Cunningham&#x27;s choreographic process works to break the boundaries of &quot;putting on a show&quot;, the removal of centre stage is an example of this—without a focal point for the audience, no one dancer or step holds the most value and can be seen as arbitrary ... or not.

==Legacy Plan==
The Cunningham Dance Foundation announced the Legacy Plan (LLP) in June 2009. The Plan provided a roadmap for the future of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, as envisioned by Cunningham. The first of its kind in the dance world, the plan represented Cunningham&#x27;s vision for continuing his work in the upcoming years, transitioning his company once he was no longer able to lead it, and preserving his oeuvre.

The Legacy Plan included a comprehensive digital documentation and preservation program, which ensures that pieces from his repertory can be studied, performed and enjoyed by future generations with knowledge of how they originally came to life. By other provisions of the plan, the Merce Cunningham Trust, established by Cunningham to serve as the custodian for his works, controls his dances for licensing purposes; Cunningham associates prepared detailed records of the dances so they could be licensed and given authentic productions by other companies. Besides, the plan outlined a final international tour for the company, and, ultimately, the closure of the Cunningham Dance Foundation and Merce Cunningham Dance Company and the transfer of all assets to the Merce Cunningham Trust. From Merce&#x27;s death at age 90 through the Board&#x27;s last meeting in 2012, the Legacy Plan implemented his wish that the company complete a worldwide legacy tour and then close. The final performance of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company was on December 31, 2011, at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City.

The final meeting of the board of directors for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company was held March 15, 2012, in Cunningham&#x27;s studio at the top of the Westbeth building in the West Village.

==Exhibitions==
There have been numerous exhibitions dedicated to Cunningham&#x27;s work. Also, his visual art was represented by Margarete Roeder Gallery until her death on December 11, 2023.

The major exhibition &quot;Invention: Merce Cunningham &amp; Collaborators&quot; at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts closed on October 13, 2007.

&quot;Merce Cunningham: Dancing on the Cutting Edge&quot;, an exhibition of recent design for MCDC, opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami, in January 2007.

A trio of exhibitions devoted to John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and Merce Cunningham, curated by Ron Bishop, was shown in the spring of 2002 at the Gallery of Fine Art, Edison College, Fort Myers, Florida.

A major exhibition about Cunningham and his collaborations, curated by Germano Celant, was first seen at the Fundació Antoni Tàpies in Barcelona in 1999, and subsequently at the Fundação de Serralves, Porto, Portugal, 1999; the Museum Moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig, Vienna, 2000; and the Museo d&#x27;Arte Contemporanea, Castello di Rivoli, Turin, 2000.

==Selected works==

Cunningham choreographed almost 200 works for his company.

<doc id="320832" wikidata="Q1204742" url="?curid=320832" title="Shōnan">
<text>is the name of a region along the coast of Sagami Bay in Kanagawa Prefecture, central Japan. Centered on Sagami River, about 60 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, the Shōnan region stretches from Ninomiya in the west to Fujisawa in the east, including Ōiso, Hiratsuka, and Chigasaki. Because of the bay, the region benefits from a mild climate and long beaches covered with dark volcanic sand.

==Overview==
The name &quot;Shonan&quot; of this Japanese region already existed in the 17th century, relative to Shigitatsu-an, according to Ōiso Town. 

During the 1880s, when the custom of swimming in the ocean was introduced into Japan, the &quot;Shonan&quot; region became a resort area for the politicians and rich people from Tokyo.

In postwar times, the Shōnan region gained prominence in Ishihara Shintaro&#x27;s prize-winning 1955 novel, &quot;Taiyō no Kisetsu&quot; (&quot;Season of the Sun&quot;). The novel, which was also made into a popular movie, portrayed the hedonistic lifestyle of young sun-worshippers from elite families (&quot;taiyo-zoku&quot;, the &quot;sun-tribe&quot;), who hung out on Shōnan beaches. Lying as it does on the edge of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area, the Shōnan region is nowadays a leading resort area, oriented to surfing, sailboating, and other water sports.

==Etymology==
There are two theories about the etymology of Shōnan (). One is that Kanagawa Prefecture where the Shōnan region is located was, until the first half of the 19th century, called Sagami-no-kuni (相模国) or Sōshū (相州) (as that phrase remains in Sagami River and Sagami Bay) and, that Shōnan was in the south (南) of Sōshū (the water sign 氵 of the Kanji radicals having been added to &quot;相&quot; to make it more poetic). The other theory is that Shōnan comes from Xiangnan County (湘南県) of the old Province/Country of Changsha (長沙国) in southern China.

In the latter theory, the region&#x27;s name, Shōnan, derives from a supposedly scenic region in Hunan, China, encapsulated in the phrase 瀟湘湖南 (Chinese pinyin: &quot;xiāo xiāng hú nán&quot;; Japanese: &quot;shōshō konan&quot;). This phrase refers to a beautiful area on the Xiao River (瀟江) and the Xiang River (湘江) south of the Yangtze River in Hunan. Often praised in Chinese poetry of the Xiaoxiang genre, the scenery of this area became a stylized and popular subject of paintings in both medieval China and Japan, particularly as to the graphic and poetic series known as the &quot;Eight Views of Xiaoxiang&quot;. In Japan, the scenery of the Shōnan area was thought to be similar to the scenery around the Xiao and Xiang rivers in Hunan, China; hence the term &quot;Shōnan&quot; (Chinese pinyin: &quot;xiāng nán&quot;, another name for the southern Hunan region) came to be applied to the area around Enoshima in Japan.

Besides the similarity in scenery, the two areas both had flood-basin lakes. The lake in China, which still exists, is Lake Dongting. Among others, the lake is fed by the Xiang and Xiao rivers (the Xiao is a tributary of the Xiang). In Japan, the corresponding flood-basin lake (which no longer exists but was mentioned in the &quot;Enoshima Engi&quot;) was probably located along the course of the Kashio River, which flows into Sagami Bay (via the Katase River) at Enoshima.

<doc id="320844" wikidata="Q956020" url="?curid=320844" title="Tōru Iwatani">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer who spent much of his career working for Namco. He is best known as the creator of the arcade game &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

==Early life ==
Iwatani was born in the Meguro ward of Tokyo, Japan on January 25, 1955. While in kindergarten, he and his family moved to the Tōhoku region of Japan after his father got a job as an engineer for the Japan Broadcasting Corporation. After becoming a junior high student, Iwatani returned to Tokyo and graduated from the Tokyo Metropolitan University High School, before graduating from the Tokai University Faculty of Engineering. Iwatani was self-taught in computers without any formal training in programming or graphic design. He often filled his school textbooks with scattered manga, which he claims had a major influence on the character designs of his games.

==Career==
At the age of 22, Iwatani joined the Japanese video game publisher Namco in 1977. Before he had joined, Namco had acquired the rights to the Japanese division of Atari, Inc. from Nolan Bushnell, giving them the rights to distribute many of the company&#x27;s games, such as &quot;Breakout&quot;, across the country. This became an unprecedented success for Namco, and made them interested in producing their own video games in-house instead of relying on other companies to make games for them.

Iwatani was assigned to the video game development division of the company upon arrival. He originally wanted to create pinball machines, however Namco executives declined the idea due to patent-related issues. As a sort-of compromise, Iwatani was allowed to create a video game based on the concept of pinball. With the assistance of programmer Shigeichi Ishimura, Iwatani created &quot;Gee Bee&quot;, released in 1978. While not as successful as the company hoped, &quot;Gee Bee&quot; helped Namco get a foothold in the gradually-expanding video game market. Two sequels were released in 1979, &quot;Bomb Bee&quot; and &quot;Cutie Q&quot;, which Iwatani worked on as a designer.

Towards the end of 1979, Iwatani grew disappointed in the video game industry, thinking that the market only appealed to men through its usage of violent &quot;war&quot; games, such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, and sports games reminiscent of &quot;Pong&quot;. He decided to create a video game that appealed to women, with cute, colorful character design and easy-to-understand gameplay, based around the concept of eating. Working with a small team of nine employees, Iwatani created &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, test-marketed on May 22, 1980, and released in Japan in July and in North America in October. While it proved to be only a moderate success in Japan, being outperformed by Namco&#x27;s own &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was an astronomical success in North America, quickly selling over 100,000 arcade units and becoming the best-selling and highest-grossing arcade game of all time. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; has since become Namco&#x27;s most-successful video game of all time and the company&#x27;s signature title. After its release, Iwatani was promoted within the ranks of Namco, eventually becoming responsible for overseeing the administration of the company. Despite the success of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, Iwatani did not receive any kind of bonus or change of salary. An often-repeated story is that Iwatani left Namco furious at the lack of any recognition or additions to his pay, which he has claimed to be false.

Iwatani went on to design &quot;Libble Rabble&quot; in 1983, a twin-stick puzzler based on a game he had played in his childhood. Iwatani claims &quot;Libble Rabble&quot; to be his favorite game. He also worked as a producer for many of Namco&#x27;s arcade games, including &quot;Rally-X&quot;, &quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; and &quot;Time Crisis&quot;. From April 2005, he taught the subject of Character Design Studies at Osaka University of Arts as visiting professor. Iwatani left Namco in March 2007 to become a full-time lecturer at Tokyo Polytechnic University. Iwatani returned to his &quot;Pac-Man&quot; roots in 2007 when he developed &quot;Pac-Man Championship Edition&quot; for the Xbox 360, which he states is the final game he will develop.

On June 3, 2010, at the Festival of Games, Iwatani received a certificate from Guinness World Records for &quot;Pac-Man&quot; having the most &quot;coin-operated arcade machines&quot; installed worldwide: 293,822. The record was set and recognized in 2005, and recorded in the &quot;Guinness World Records: Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2008&quot;.

He was portrayed in the Adam Sandler sci-fi comedy adventure &quot;Pixels&quot; by actor Denis Akiyama, while Iwatani himself has a cameo as an arcade repairman.

<doc id="320852" wikidata="Q1143340" url="?curid=320852" title="Sobeys">
<text>Sobeys Inc. is a national supermarket chain in Canada with over 1,500 stores operating under a variety of banners. Headquartered in Stellarton, Nova Scotia, it operates stores in all ten provinces and accumulated sales of more than C$25.1 billion in the fiscal 2019 operating year. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Empire Company Limited, a Canadian business conglomerate.

It is a participant in the voluntary Scanner Price Accuracy Code managed by the Retail Council of Canada.

==History==

Sobeys was founded in Stellarton, Nova Scotia by John W. Sobey, a former carpenter, in 1907 as a meat delivery business.

In 1921, Sobey&#x27;s son, Frank, became a partner of the company and added six new grocery stores serving the Pictou County and Antigonish County regions. In 1946, Sobey&#x27;s opened its first supermarket in New Glasgow after purchasing the operations to Barker Store. By this time, Frank was the first president of J. W. Sobey Stores Limited. By late 1977, Sobeys had 65 store locations.

The chain eventually expanded throughout Atlantic Canada. During most of the second half of the 20th century, it was the region&#x27;s dominant grocer. In the 1980s, Sobeys expanded into southern Ontario, challenging Loblaws on its &quot;home turf&quot;, thereby igniting what came to be a nationwide battle for market supremacy.

Sobeys had significant stakes in New England grocer Hannaford, Quebec grocer Provigo (which owned California grocer Petrini’s), and US wholesaler Nash Finch Company until the 1990s. In 1998, Sobeys became the second-largest grocer in the country after purchasing the Oshawa Group, owners of the IGA franchise across Canada, along with several regional chains in Ontario, in addition to various food service and wholesale companies.

In 2002, Sobeys undertook major changes in its store design and customer service policies with the introduction of &quot;Ready to serve&quot;. This initiative was reportedly an attempt to emulate the successful moves of the Publix supermarket chain in the southern United States.

In 2005, Sobeys lost a bidding war with Quebec-based Metro to acquire A&amp;P Canada, operator of several Ontario supermarket chains. The all-cash offer made by Sobeys was reportedly the highest bid for the chain, but the U.S. parent, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, ultimately accepted Metro&#x27;s $1.7 billion cash-and-stock offer. It is also suggested that the Sobey family was unwilling to cede any control to the Tengelmann Group, the ultimate parent company of A&amp;P at the time. Though Sobeys remained the second largest grocery chain in Canada, it was the third place chain in most of the provinces outside the Atlantic region, and the successful purchase of A&amp;P Canada would have helped to bolster its position in Ontario.

In 2007, Sobeys announced a $253 million takeover offer for the Thrifty Foods chain in British Columbia.

In September 2011, Sobeys&#x27; wholesale division signed a long-term distribution agreement with American retailer Target for the supply of select food and grocery products to its Canadian stores. In March 2012, Sobeys acquired 236 Shell gas station locations in Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

In June 2013, Sobeys announced the purchase of Safeway&#x27;s Canadian operations for $5.8 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The acquisition added Safeway&#x27;s 214 locations, primarily located in Western Canada, to its portfolio. As a condition of the deal imposed by the Competition Bureau in October 2013, Sobeys was required to sell 23 of its retail locations to other companies. Sobeys sold 29 of its locations, which included 18 Safeway stores. Fifteen were sold to Overwaitea Food Group (particularly in British Columbia and Alberta), and fourteen were sold to affiliates of Federated Co-operatives (particularly in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) for $430 million in total. In June 2014, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close 50 of its &quot;underperforming&quot; locations. The stores affected were primarily in Western Canada, although some in Ontario and the Atlantic region were also affected. In 2015, Sobeys acquired certain assets and select liabilities of Co-op Atlantic.

In July 2016, Empire Company CEO Marc Poulin abruptly left the company after Sobeys reported a $942.6 million loss, which was credited to difficulties in integrating the Safeway chain into Sobeys overall operations. The &quot;Financial Post&quot; also reported that changes made by Sobeys, including the discontinuation of its popular loyalty program, the replacement of Safeway&#x27;s house brands with Sobeys&#x27; brands, reports of poorly stocked inventories at Safeway locations, had impacted the chain&#x27;s customer loyalty.

In January 2018, Sobeys announced an agreement with Ocado to open an e-commerce grocery fulfilment centre in Toronto during late 2020. In contrast, Sobeys-owned Thrifty Foods and IGA use their stores as fulfilment centres for online orders.

In late January 2018, Sobeys announced that it would, in the wake of the Safeway purchase, close an additional 10 of its &quot;underperforming&quot; locations. The stores affected were in the Fraser Valley Area of British Columbia in Western Canada, and were closed on May 5 with the exception of one of the ten stores that were closed on July 28. Some of the stores affected would reopen as FreshCo. As part of the FreshCo expansion in Western Canada, 22 locations have been confirmed, including the first two Chalo! FreshCo stores out West in Surrey, B.C.

In July 2019, Sobeys announced it will be switching from plastic to paper grocery bags in all its stores by the end of 2020.

In September 2023, David Sobey, former chief executive and chair of the Sobeys Inc. grocery store chain, died at the age of 92.

==Private label brands==
The Sobeys private label lineup has had several names. They were introduced under the &quot;Sobeys&quot; name, and were renamed &quot;Our Best&quot; in the late 1990s. After its purchase of Oshawa Group, Sobeys dropped &quot;Our Best&quot; in favour of Oshawa&#x27;s &quot;Our Compliments&quot; brand.

In 2005, Sobeys shortened the name to &quot;Compliments&quot;. At the same time, it expanded the brand&#x27;s lineup to compete with labels such as Loblaw&#x27;s President&#x27;s Choice brand. From 2007–2010, they offered &quot;Compliments Junior&quot;, aimed at children and co-branded with The Walt Disney Company.

In late 2009, lower-price store-brand products were transitioned from &quot;Compliments Value&quot; to the &quot;Signal&quot; brand, which Sobeys used in the 1990s for a range of similar products. After the Oshawa Group merger, Sobeys dropped that name for Oshawa&#x27;s &quot;Smart Choice&quot; label, and later for &quot;Compliments Value&quot;.

Private-label soft drinks are branded &quot;Big 8&quot; in Atlantic Canada. Elsewhere, soft drinks bear the Compliments brand.

==Banners==

In addition to the flagship Sobeys banner, the company operates supermarkets under a number of other banners:

===IGA===

IGA and IGA Extra are the main banners in the province of Quebec. There are also 35 Sobeys-owned IGA stores in Western Canada. An IGA store is also in mainly French-speaking Edmundston, New Brunswick, and an IGA Extra (a rebranded Sobeys location) is in Caraquet and Campbellton, New Brunswick. MarketPlace IGA stores in British Columbia are independently owned by H.Y. Louie, parent company of London Drugs. These stores also carry Compliments products. Sobeys has reportedly made unsuccessful attempts to purchase the MarketPlace chain.

At the time of the Sobeys takeover of the Oshawa Group, all IGA locations in Atlantic Canada were purchased separately by Loblaws for competition reasons. Loblaws converted these IGA locations to their own banners.

=== Safeway ===

In June 2013, Sobeys announced its intent to acquire Safeway&#x27;s Canadian stores for $5.8 billion.

===Foodland===

Sobeys operates the smaller grocery store Foodland chain, mainly in rural areas of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario. In 2022, a flyer for the supermarket was criticized for featuring farm owners who allegedly mistreated migrant workers from Jamaica. Other smaller grocery stores are operated under the Tradition Markets banner in Quebec and the Food Town banner in Western Canada.

===Thrifty Foods===

Sobeys operates Thrifty Foods, a chain of 26 grocery stores with an online grocery service based in Victoria, British Columbia.

===FreshCo and Chalo FreshCo===

In 2010, Sobeys launched FreshCo, a discount banner. The pilot stores are rebranded Price Chopper outlets in Southern Ontario. FreshCo uses a franchise model and the stores are independently owned.

In April 2019, FreshCo launched in Western Canada, opening three stores in British Columbia and two in Winnipeg, as well as two Chalo! FreshCo stores in British Columbia. They have since announced additional locations as part of its expansion into Western Canada. The Western Canadian stores are branded with the distinctive new FreshCo 2.0 look and feel, and an updated merchandising program that is also being used with FreshCo stores in Ontario. There are 7 locations that have been rebranded as Chalo FreshCo in areas with large South Asian Canadian communities.

===Sobeys Urban Fresh===

In 2008, a uniquely designed urban-format Sobeys was opened in downtown Edmonton. It was closed in the summer of 2014; a Sobeys representative said, &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t financially viable for us to operate.&quot; Other Edmonton locations have been proposed, including College Heights and Cloverdale; as well as locations in Calgary and Vancouver.

===Sobeys Extra===
In November 2013, Sobeys unveiled its first &quot;Sobeys Extra&quot; store in Burlington, Ontario. The newly refurbished 58,000-sq.-ft. store is the first launched under the Sobeys Extra banner in Canada.

===Former grocery banners===
*Commisso&#x27;s Food Markets in Ontario were rebranded Sobeys and Price Chopper.
*Food City from the Oshawa Group in Ontario were mainly rebranded Price Chopper.
*Garden Market IGA stores in Western Canada were rebranded Sobeys.
*Dutch Boy, a chain in the Kitchener-Waterloo area of Ontario, was rebranded Sobeys.
*Knechtel, a small-market grocery store chain under Oshawa Group, was rebranded Foodland.
*Lofood, a small discount grocery store, was rebranded Price Chopper.
*Calbeck&#x27;s, an independent chain acquired in 1990, was rebranded Sobeys, Price Chopper and Foodland.

===Other Sobeys-owned enterprises===
The company owns the Needs, Sobeys Express, and BoniChoix convenience store chains, and the Lawtons drug store chain in Atlantic Canada. They also own the wholesale food distribution company TRA Atlantic. The company delivers products to retail outlets, such as convenience stores and gas stations, throughout Atlantic Canada. TRA also operates the Kwik-Way and Clover Farm convenience store chains.

At some Sobeys locations, tobacco products are sold in a separate Sobeys-owned store called Griffins. They are a part of the Sobeys store but only accessible from the outside, due to provincial laws prohibiting stores with pharmacies from selling tobacco products. A number of Sobeys and Needs stores in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have a gas bar branded Sobeys Fast Fuel.

Sobeys Express stores (called IGA Express in Quebec) feature produce and take-out meals alongside items commonly found in convenience stores. Some are operated as the convenience store for Sobeys-operated Shell stations.

On September 24, 2018, Empire Co. Ltd., Sobeys&#x27; parent, announced it had signed an agreement to purchase Farm Boy, an Ontario chain of 26 supermarkets, for $800-million. Farm Boy founder Jean-Louis Bellemare and his co-CEO Jeff York will continue in their roles, since the company will operate as a separate entity. The move allows Farm Boy to continue with aggressive expansion plans into Southwestern Ontario, particularly the Toronto region. The number of stores was expected to double over the next five years.

==Loyalty programs==

===Air Miles===
, in Quebec, Ontario and western Canada, Sobeys and its affiliated banners continue to offer the Air Miles loyalty rewards program. At various times prior to joining Air Miles, Sobeys-owned locations in many regions offered the in-house Club Sobeys/Club Thrifty Foods program. In current calculations and practices, 95 accrued reward miles (with each mile earned for every $20 spent) can be redeemed for $10 off of purchases.

When Sobeys became an Air Miles partner, its partnership was restricted to Quebec and Atlantic Canada—the same territory rights held by Oshawa Group prior to its acquisition by Sobeys in 1998. Air Miles had partnered with Safeway for all of its locations across western Canada and northwestern Ontario, while A&amp;P Canada (later Metro) had the rights in the rest of Ontario. In June 2014, shortly after its acquisition of Safeway Canada (Air Miles&#x27; original grocery partner), Sobeys announced plans to expand its Air Miles participation to Sobeys, IGA, Foodland and Thrifty Foods stores in Western Canada and Northwestern Ontario on September 12, 2014, replacing Club Sobeys and Club Thrifty Foods in those areas.

===Club Sobeys===
Club Sobeys was a loyalty program at the chain&#x27;s Atlantic Canada locations offered during the 1990s, prior to Sobeys securing the regional rights to Air Miles through the Oshawa Group merger. As the company expanded its operations in Ontario and Western Canada in the 2000s, Sobeys introduced the Club Sobeys program in those markets. It was known as Club Thrifty Foods in the British Columbia locations of that chain, after it was acquired.

In the Club Sobeys region, Sobeys introduced, in partnership with Citibank Canada, a Club Sobeys MasterCard credit card. These card accounts were later transferred to Bank of Montreal, which also introduced the BMO Sobeys Air Miles MasterCard in Atlantic Canada (and IGA Air Miles MasterCard in Quebec). Following the transition from Club Sobeys to Air Miles in 2014, all Club Sobeys credit cards were converted to BMO Sobeys Air Miles MasterCards, which were then replaced by standard BMO Air Miles Mastercards a few years later.

In early 2015, Sobeys announced that the Air Miles loyalty program would be extended into Ontario on March 27, 2015, replacing the Club Sobeys loyalty program. This was a result of a new agreement between Air Miles and Metro, which extended Metro&#x27;s partnership but gave up its exclusivity in the grocery category in Ontario.

===Scene+===
In June 2022, Empire Company announced that it will end its participation in Air Miles and switch to the Cineplex Entertainment and Scotiabank-owned Scene+ program at its grocery and pharmacy chains. Empire will also hold an ownership stake in the company. The transition began with Atlantic Canada on August 11, 2022, to be followed by a nationwide rollout to Quebec (IGA), Ontario and Western Canada through late 2022 to early 2023.

==Controversies==
===Bread price-fixing===
In 2018, Sobeys was implicated in a 14-16 year long national price-fixing cartel with other Canadian supermarkets and the bread supplier Canada Bread. Sobeys, along with other retailers, allegedly conspired to fix the price of bread and arrange when increases would be made. Canada Bread pled guilty to four counts of price fixing in July 2023. Sobeys has denied any culpability, calling the allegations &quot;irresponsible&quot;; no charges have been filed to date against Sobeys.

==Online grocery sales==

In January 2018, the company signed a deal with British company Ocado Group PLC to provide e-commerce solution for Sobeys using robots to assemble customer orders.

Michael Medline, CEO of Empire and Sobeys, said that the online grocery sales business would not be ready for approximately two years, and that he expected it to take another two years for the business to be profitable. A Bloomberg News reporter who viewed a video of a similar system described the process: &quot;[The] similar Ocado facility in Andover, England, shows the facility spanning nearly 21,000 square metres (5¼ acres) with robots rolling over a grid to pick and pack customer orders in about five minutes.&quot; The publication Tech Insider, owned by Business Insider, posted a similar video to YouTube, stating: &quot;Ocado&#x27;s new warehouse has thousands of robots zooming around a grid system to pack groceries. [These] robots can process 65,000 orders every week. They communicate on a 4G network to avoid bumping into each other. Is this the future of retail?&quot;

In addition to operating the automated warehouse, Ocado&#x27;s
technology provides instructions to delivery vans.

Voilà, an online grocery retailer operated by Sobeys launched in June 2020.

==Charitable sponsorship==
Sobeys is a national partner of Special Olympics Canada.

==Locations==
Sobeys is based in Stellarton, Nova Scotia and has 27 distribution centres in Canada.

Its stores are located across Canada with 54 in Alberta, 1 in British Columbia, 17 in Manitoba, 23 in New Brunswick, 14 in Newfoundland and Labrador, 42 in Nova Scotia, 90 in Ontario, 5 in Prince Edward Island, and 10 in Saskatchewan.

==Empire Company==
The Sobeys conglomerate is owned by Empire Company Limited, which is controlled by the Sobey family. The Empire Company also owns the trademarks to their former Empire Theatres cinema chain, which was until October 2013 Canada&#x27;s second-largest movie theatre chain, when its locations were split between Cineplex Entertainment (Atlantic locations) and Landmark Cinemas (Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta). Empire also owns many commercial properties through its subsidiary Crombie REIT.

<doc id="320853" wikidata="Q338432" url="?curid=320853" title="Accademia dei Lincei">
<text>The  (; literally the &quot;Academy of the Lynx-Eyed&quot;), anglicised as the Lincean Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious European scientific institutions, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy. Founded in the Papal States in 1603 by Federico Cesi, the academy was named after the lynx, an animal whose sharp vision symbolizes the observational prowess that science requires. Galileo Galilei was the intellectual centre of the academy and adopted &quot;Galileo Galilei Linceo&quot; as his signature. &quot;The Lincei did not long survive the death in 1630 of Cesi, its founder and patron&quot;, and &quot;disappeared in 1651.&quot;

During the nineteenth century, it was revived, first in the Papal States and later in the nation of Italy. Thus the Pontifical Academy of Science, founded in 1847, claims this heritage as the &quot;Accademia Pontificia dei Nuovi Lincei (&quot;Pontifical Academy of the New Lynxes&quot;)&quot;, descending from the first two incarnations of the Academy. Similarly, a lynx-eyed academy of the 1870s became the national academy of Italy, encompassing both literature and science among its concerns.

==First &quot;Accademia&quot; ==

The first was founded in 1603 by Federico Cesi, an aristocrat from Umbria (the son of Duke of Acquasparta and a member of an important family from Rome) who was passionately interested in natural history – particularly botany. Cesi&#x27;s father disapproved of the research career that Federico was pursuing. His mother, Olimpia Orsini, supported him both financially and morally. The Academy struggled due to this disapproval, but after the death of Frederico&#x27;s father, he had enough money to allow the academy to flourish. The academy, hosted in Palazzo Cesi-Armellini near Saint Peter, replaced the first scientific community ever, Giambattista della Porta&#x27;s &quot;Academia Secretorum Naturae&quot; in Naples that had been closed by the Inquisition. Cesi founded the with three friends: the Dutch physician Johannes van Heeck (Italianized to Giovanni Ecchio) and two fellow Umbrians, mathematician Francesco Stelluti and polymath Anastasio de Filiis. At the time of the Accademia&#x27;s founding Cesi was only 18, and the others were only 8 years older. Cesi and his friends aimed to understand all of the natural sciences. The literary and antiquarian emphasis set the &quot;Lincei&quot; apart from the host of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Italian Academies. Cesi envisioned a program of free experiment that was respectful of tradition, yet unfettered by blind obedience to authority, even that of Aristotle and Ptolemy, whose theories the new science called into question. While originally a private association, the Academy became a semi-public establishment during the Napoleonic domination of Rome. This shift allowed the local scientific elite to carve out a place for themselves in larger scientific networks. However, as a semi-public establishment, the Academy&#x27;s focus was directed by Napoleonic politics. This focus directed the member&#x27;s efforts towards stimulating industry, turning public opinion in favour of the French regime and secularizing the country.

The name &quot;Lincei&quot; &#x27;the lynx-like (i. e., lynx-eyed, sharp-eyed) ones&#x27; came from Giambattista della Porta&#x27;s book &quot;Magia Naturalis&quot;, which had an illustration of the fabled cat on the cover and the words &quot;[...] with lynx-like eyes, examining those things which manifest themselves, so that having observed them, he may zealously use them&quot;. &#x27;s symbols were both a lynx and an eagle; animals with, or reputed to have, keen sight (in classical and medieval bestiaries the lynx was reputed to be able to see through rock and &quot;new walls&quot;). The academy&#x27;s motto, chosen by Cesi, was: &quot;Take care of small things if you want to obtain the greatest results&quot; (&quot;minima cura si maxima vis&quot;). According to T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane, their other motto was &quot;Sagacius ista&quot;. When Cesi visited Naples, he met with many scientists in fields of interest to him including the botanist, Fabio Colonna, the natural history writer, Ferrante Imperato, and the polymath della Porta. Della Porta was impressed with Cesi, and dedicated three works to the Linceans including a treatise on distillation called &quot;De Distillatione&quot;, a book on curvilinear geometry called &quot;Elementa Curvilinea&quot;, and &quot;The Transformations of the Atmosphere&quot;. Della Porta encouraged Cesi to continue with his endeavours. Giambattista della Porta joined Cesi&#x27;s academy in 1610. While in Naples, Cesi also met with Nardo Antonio Recchi to negotiate the acquisition of a collection of material describing Aztec plants and animals written by Francisco Hernández de Toledo. This collection of material would eventually become the &quot;Tesoro Messicano&quot; (&quot;Mexican Treasury&quot;). 

The goal was nothing less than the assembly of modern science reflected on the method of observation: the church of knowledge. The Academy was to possess in each quarter of the global communes with adequate endowments to retain membership. These communes were complete with libraries, laboratories, museums, printing presses, and botanical gardens. Members frequently wrote letters about their observations. The Lyncæis denounced marriage as a &quot;&quot;mollis&quot; &quot;et&quot; &quot;effeminata requies&quot;&quot; (i.e. a soft and feminine rest) which would pose an &quot;obstacle to a life of research&quot;. Membership was banned to monks. Members were ordered to &quot;penetrate into the interior of things in order to know the causes and operations of nature, as it is said the lynx does, which sees not only what is outside, but what is hidden within.&quot;

Galileo was inducted to the exclusive Academy on April 25, 1611, and became its intellectual centre. Galileo clearly felt honoured by his association with the Academy for he adopted &quot;Galileo Galilei Linceo&quot; as his signature. The Academy published his works and supported him during his disputes with the Roman Inquisition. Among the Academy&#x27;s early publications in the fields of astronomy, physics and botany were Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Letters on Sunspots&quot; and &quot;The Assayer&quot;, and the &quot;Tesoro Messicano&quot; describing the flora, fauna and drugs of the New World, which took decades of labour, down to 1651. With this publication, the first, most famous phase of the Lincei was concluded. The new usage of microscopy, with &quot;references to magnification tools can be found in the works of Galileo and several Lincei, Harvey, Gassendi, Marco Aurelio Severino—who was probably also in contact with the Lincie—and Nathanial Highmore.&quot; Domenico Bertoloni Meli, in Mechanism, Experiment, Disease: Marcello Malpighi and Seventeenth-Century Anatomy (Johns Hopkins University Press: 2011; p. 41). Microscopes were not just by the Lincei for astronomical and mathematical work, but were also used for new experimentations in anatomy, as this was the time of the rise of mechanistic anatomy, and the theories of atomism. Experimentation proliferated across the board. Cesi&#x27;s own intense activity was cut short by his sudden death in 1630 at forty-five.

The Linceans produced an important collection of micrographs or drawings made with the help of the newly invented microscope. After Cesi&#x27;s death, the closed and the drawings were collected by Cassiano dal Pozzo, a Roman antiquarian, whose heirs sold them. The majority of the collection was procured by George III of the United Kingdom, in 1763. The drawings were discovered in Windsor Castle in 1986, by art historian David Freedberg. They are being published as part of &quot;The Paper Museum of Cassiano dal Pozzo&quot;.

== &quot;Accademia&quot; re-foundation ==

In 1801, Abbot Feliciano Scarpellini and Gioacchino Pessuti, with the patronage of Francesco Caetani, founded the &quot;Accademia Caetani&quot; which took the name of . The period from 1801 to 1840 has been termed the &quot;Second Renaissance&quot; of the Accademia. Conflicting goals and general shifts in the &quot;geo-political scale&quot; left the Academy in a state of limbo, which ultimately led to its collapse in the 1840s. During the French domination of the Accademia, the institution saw a transition from a private association to a municipal institution. Despite efforts from the early 1800s onward, the Accademia underwent a true revival in 1847, when Pope Pius IX re-founded it as the Pontificia Accademia dei Nuovi Lincei, anglicised as the Pontifical Academy of New Lincei.

==&quot;Reale Accademia dei Lincei&quot;==

In 1874, Quintino Sella turned it into the Accademia Nazionale Reale dei Lincei, anglicised as the Royal National Lincean Academy. This incarnation broadened its scope to include moral and humanistic sciences, and regained the high prestige associated with the original Lincean Academy. After the unification of Italy, the Piedmontese Quintino Sella infused new life into the &quot;Nuovi Lincei&quot;, reaffirming its ideals of secular science, but broadening its scope to include humanistic studies: history, philology, archaeology, philosophy, economics and law, in two classes of &quot;Soci&quot; (Fellows).

==&quot;Accademia d&#x27;Italia&quot;==

:&quot;see main article Royal Academy of Italy

During the Italian fascist period, the Lincean Academy was effectively replaced by the new Accademia d&#x27;Italia, the Italian Academy, but was not fully absorbed by that institution until 1939. In 1949, after the fall of the fascist regime, at the suggestion of Benedetto Croce, the Lincean Academy recovered its independence. A brief history of this period of the Accademia, as well as the complete inventory of publications and documents produced in the same period, can be found in the book by .

==&quot;Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei&quot;==

In 1986, the Academy was placed under a statute that says it shall be composed of 540 members, of whom 180 are ordinary Italian members, 180 are foreigners, and 180 are Italian corresponding members. The members are divided into two classes: one for mathematical, physical, and natural sciences; the other for moral, historical, and philological sciences.

In 2001, the natural sciences were re-divided into five categories: mathematics, mechanics and applications; astronomy, geodesy, geophysics and applications; physics, chemistry and applications; geology, paleontology, mineralogy and applications; and biological sciences and applications. At the same time, the moral sciences were divided into seven categories: philology and linguistics; archaeology; criticism of art and of poetry; history, historical geography, and anthropology; philosophical science; juridical science; social and political science.
== Prizes ==
The Accademia regularly awards prestigious prizes to talented researchers and scholars. Notable prizes include:
* Premio Presidente della Repubblica
* Feltrinelli Prize
* Alfredo di Braccio Award for young Italian researchers in Physics and Chemistry
* Premio del Ministro per i Beni e le Attività Culturali
* Premio Linceo
* Premio Internazionale Cataldo Agostinelli e Angela Gili Agostinelli

<text>In mathematics, a constant function is a function whose (output) value is the same for every input value.

== Basic properties ==

As a real-valued function of a real-valued argument, a constant function has the general form or just For example, the function is the specific constant function where the output value is . The domain of this function is the set of all real numbers. The image of this function is the singleton set . The independent variable does not appear on the right side of the function expression and so its value is &quot;vacuously substituted&quot;; namely , , , and so on. No matter what value of is input, the output is .

The graph of the constant function is a &quot;horizontal line&quot; in the plane that passes through the point . In the context of a polynomial in one variable , the constant function is called &quot;non-zero constant function&quot; because it is a polynomial of degree 0, and its general form is , where is nonzero. This function has no intersection point with the axis, meaning it has no root (zero). On the other hand, the polynomial is the &quot;identically zero function&quot;. It is the (trivial) constant function and every is a root. Its graph is the axis in the plane. Its graph is symmetric with respect to the axis, and therefore a constant function is an even function.

In the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. Because a constant function does not change, its derivative is 0. This is often written: formula_1. The converse is also true. Namely, if for all real numbers , then is a constant function. For example, given the constant function The derivative of is the identically zero function 

== Other properties ==
For functions between preordered sets, constant functions are both order-preserving and order-reversing; conversely, if is both order-preserving and order-reversing, and if the domain of is a lattice, then must be constant.

* Every constant function whose domain and codomain are the same set is a left zero of the full transformation monoid on , which implies that it is also idempotent.
* It has zero slope or gradient. 
* Every constant function between topological spaces is continuous.
* A constant function factors through the one-point set, the terminal object in the category of sets. This observation is instrumental for F. William Lawvere&#x27;s axiomatization of set theory, the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets (ETCS). 
* For any non-empty , every set is isomorphic to the set of constant functions in formula_2. For any and each element in , there is a unique function formula_3 such that formula_4 for all formula_5. Conversely, if a function formula_6 satisfies formula_7 for all formula_8, formula_9 is by definition a constant function.
** As a corollary, the one-point set is a generator in the category of sets.
** Every set formula_10 is canonically isomorphic to the function set formula_11, or hom set formula_12 in the category of sets, where 1 is the one-point set. Because of this, and the adjunction between Cartesian products and hom in the category of sets (so there is a canonical isomorphism between functions of two variables and functions of one variable valued in functions of another (single) variable, formula_13) the category of sets is a closed monoidal category with the Cartesian product of sets as tensor product and the one-point set as tensor unit. In the isomorphisms formula_14 natural in, the left and right unitors are the projections formula_15 and formula_16 the ordered pairs formula_17 and formula_18 respectively to the element formula_19, where formula_20 is the unique point in the one-point set.

A function on a connected set is locally constant if and only if it is constant.

<text>Rocketdyne is an American rocket engine design and production company headquartered in Canoga Park, in the western San Fernando Valley of suburban Los Angeles, in southern California.

Rocketdyne was founded as a division of North American Aviation in 1955 and was later part of Rockwell International from 1967 until 1996 and Boeing from 1996 to 2005. In 2005, Boeing sold the Rocketdyne division to United Technologies Corporation, becoming Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne as part of Pratt &amp; Whitney. In 2013, Rocketdyne was sold to GenCorp, Inc., which merged it with Aerojet to form Aerojet Rocketdyne.

==History==
After World War II, North American Aviation (NAA) was contracted by the Defense Department to study the German V-2 missile and adapt its engine to Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) measurements and U.S. construction details. NAA also used the same general concept of separate burner/injectors from the V-2 engine design to build a much larger engine for the Navaho missile project (1946–1958). This work was considered unimportant in the 1940s and funded at a very low level, but the start of the Korean War in 1950 changed priorities. NAA had begun to use the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) high in the Simi Hills around 1947 for the Navaho&#x27;s rocket engine testing. At that time the site was much farther away from major populated areas than the early test sites NAA had been using within Los Angeles.

Navaho ran into continual difficulties and was canceled in 1958 when the Chrysler Corporation Missile Division&#x27;s Redstone missile design (essentially an improved V-2) had caught up in development. However the Rocketdyne engine, known as the A-5 or NAA75-110, proved to be considerably more reliable than the one developed for Redstone, so the missile was redesigned with the A-5 even though the resulting missile had much shorter range.

As the missile entered production, NAA spun off Rocketdyne in 1955 as a separate division, and built its new plant in the then small Los Angeles suburb of Canoga Park, in the San Fernando Valley near and below its Santa Susana Field Laboratory.

In 1967, NAA, with its Rocketdyne and Atomics International divisions, merged with the Rockwell Corporation to form North American Rockwell, becoming in 1973 Rockwell International.

===Thor, Delta, Atlas===
Rocketdyne&#x27;s next major development was its first all-new design, the S-3D, which had been developed in parallel to the V-2 derived A series. The S-3 was used on the Army&#x27;s Jupiter missile design, essentially a development of the Redstone, and was later selected for the competitor Air Force Thor missile. An even larger design, the LR89/LR105, was used on the Atlas missile. The Thor had a short military career, but it was used as a satellite launcher through the 1950s and 60s in a number of different versions. One, &quot;Thor Delta&quot;, became the baseline for the current Delta series of space launchers, although since the late 1960s the Delta has had almost nothing in common with the Thor. Although the original S-3 engine was used on some Delta versions, most use its updated RS-27 design, originally developed as a single engine to replace the three-engine cluster on the Atlas.

The Atlas also had a short military career as a deterrent weapon, but the Atlas rocket family descended from it became an important orbital launcher for many decades, both for the Project Mercury crewed spacecraft, and in the much-employed Atlas-Agena and Atlas-Centaur rockets. The Atlas V is still in manufacture and use.

===NASA===
Rocketdyne also became the major supplier for NASA&#x27;s development efforts, supplying all of the major engines for the Saturn rocket, and potentially, the huge Nova rocket designs. Rocketdyne&#x27;s H-1 engine was used by the Saturn I booster main stage. Five F-1 engines powered the Saturn V&#x27;s S-IC first stage, while five J-2 engines powered its S-II second stage, and one J-2 the S-IVB third stages. By 1965, Rocketdyne built the vast majority of United States rocket engines, excepting those of the Titan rocket (built by Aerojet), and its payroll had grown to 65,000. This sort of growth appeared to be destined to continue in the 1970s when Rocketdyne won the contract for the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), but the rapid downturn in other military and civilian contracts led to downsizing of the company. North American Aviation, largely a spacecraft manufacturer, and also tied almost entirely to the Space Shuttle, merged with the Rockwell Corporation in 1966 to form the North American Rockwell company, which became Rockwell International in 1973, with Rocketdyne as a major division.

===Downsizing===
During continued downsizing in the 1980s and 1990s, Rockwell International shed several parts of the former North American Rockwell corporation. The aerospace entities of Rockwell International, including the former NAA and Rocketdyne, were sold to Boeing in 1996. Rocketdyne became part of Boeing&#x27;s Defense division. In February 2005, Boeing reached an agreement to sell what was by then referred to as &quot;Rocketdyne Propulsion &amp; Power&quot; to Pratt &amp; Whitney of United Technologies Corporation. The transaction was completed on August 2, 2005. Boeing retained ownership of Rocketdyne&#x27;s Santa Susana Field Lab.

GenCorp, Inc. purchased Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne in 2013 from United Technologies Corporation, and merged it with Aerojet to form Aerojet Rocketdyne.

==Facilities and operations==
===Canoga Park, California ===
Rocketdyne maintained division headquarters and rocket engine manufacturing facilities at Canoga Park from 1955 until 2014.

North American Aviation&#x27;s rocket development activities began with engine tests nearby the Los Angeles Airport. In 1948, NAA began testing liquid rocket engines within the Simi Hills which would later become the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. The company sought a location for a manufacturing plant nearby the Simi Hills testing site. In 1954, North American Aviation purchased 56 acres of land within the current Warner Center area then deeded the property to the Air Force. The Air Force, in turn, designated the site Air Force Plant No. 56 and contracted with Rocketdyne to build and operate the facility. NAA completed construction of the main manufacturing building and designated Rocketdyne as a new company division in November 1955.

Rocketdyne&#x27;s success resulted in the addition of buildings within a growing footprint. At its peak, the Rocketdyne Canoga facility comprised some 27 different buildings over 119 acres of land, including over one million square feet of manufacturing area plus 516,000 square feet of office space. The Canoga plant grew into areas both east and southeast of the original location. In 1960, Rocketdyne opened a headquarters building at the southeast corner of Victory Boulevard and Canoga Avenue. A pedestrian tunnel underneath Victory Boulevard east of Canoga Avenue provided access between buildings to the South (including the Headquarters) and those located to the North of the street. (The tunnel was removed in 1973.)

The Canoga plant shrank over time via piecemeal property sales and building demolitions into the 2000s. With the completion of the Apollo program in 1969, Rocketdyne ended the leases of several facilities and returned the headquarters offices to the Canoga Main building. In 1973, Rocketdyne repurchased the Air Force Plant No. 56 property, thereby ending the government designation. The Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, and further reductions followed. Pratt and Whitney retained ownership of the Canoga property when Rocketdyne was sold to Aerojet in 2013; the remaining property measured roughly 47 acres with buildings and structures comprising a total of 770,000 square feet.

Rocketdyne played a key role in the United States space program and the development of propulsion systems. Ten years after being established, the Canoga plant produced the vast majority of America&#x27;s United States liquid rocket engines (except those of the Titan rocket, them being built by Aerojet). Through the end of the twentieth century, Rocketdyne products powered all major engines for the Saturn program and every space program in the United States.

Six specific periods of liquid rocket engine development and manufacturing programs took place at the Canoga plant: Atlas (1954-late 1960s), Thor (1961-1975), Jupiter (1955-1962), Saturn (1961-1975); Apollo (1961-1972); Space Shuttle (1981-2011). Key rocket engine technologies were advanced at the Rocketdyne Canoga plant: gimbaling of rocket engines, introduction of engine injector baffling plates for improved combustion stability, tubular regenerative cooling, &quot;stage and a half&quot; engine configuration first used on Atlas, thrust chamber ignition using pyrophoric chemicals and electrically controlled starting sequences.

Aerojet Rocketdyne moved its office and manufacturing operations to the DeSoto campus in 2014. Demolition and site clearing of the former Rocketdyne facility in Canoga Park commenced in August 2016. As of February 2019, the future land use of the site has not been announced.

===McGregor, Texas===
Rocketdyne&#x27;s Solid Propulsion Operations business unit was engaged in the development, testing and production of solid rocket engines at McGregor, Texas for nearly twenty years.

The Rocket Fuels Division of Phillips Petroleum Company began using the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant in 1952. In 1958, Phillips and Rocketdyne entered a partnership to form Astrodyne Incorporated. In 1959, Rocketdyne purchased full ownership of the company and renamed it Solid Propulsion Operations (later designated the Solid Rocket Division). The purchase caused Rocketdyne to invest in facilities and research at McGregor towards diversification into other propellant types and rockets engines. Notably, Rocketdyne installed a facility capable of testing engines having up to three million pounds of thrust.

The Solid Propulsion Operations initially used ammonium nitrate-based propellants in the manufacture of gas generators used to start aircraft jet engines, turbopumps of the Rocketdyne H-1 rocket engine and the manufacture of the Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) rocket engines. Ullage motors were developed for the Saturn V Space Vehicle. The group also built solid propellant boosters providing for the zero-length launching of North American F-100 Super Sabre and Lockheed F-104 Starfighter aircraft. The motor provided a takeoff thrust of 130,000 lbf for 4 seconds, accelerating the aircraft to 275 miles per hour and 4 g before separating and dropping away from the jet.

In 1959, the group began using ammonium perchlorate oxidizer combined with carboxyl-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB) binder to produce solid propellants marketed under the trade name &quot;Flexadyne.&quot; For the next nineteen years, Rocketdyne used the formulation in the production of solid rocket motors for three major missile systems: the AIM-7 Sparrow III, AGM-45 Shrike, and the AIM-54 Phoenix. Rocketdyne transferred operation of the McGregor plant to Hercules Inc. in 1978. A portion of the former Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant is now used by SpaceX as their Rocket Development and Test Facility.

===Neosho, Missouri===
A rocket engine manufacturing plant was operated by Rocketdyne over a twelve-year period at Neosho, Missouri. The plant was constructed by the U.S. Air Force within a 2,000-acre portion of Fort Crowder, a decommissioned World War II training base. The Rocketdyne division of North American Aviation operated the site, employing approximately 1,250 workers beginning in 1956. The plant primarily produced the MA-5 booster, sustainer and vernier rocket engines, H-1 engines and components for the F-1 and J-2 rocket engines. The P4-1 (a.k.a. LR64) engine was also manufactured for the AQM-37A target drone. The engines and components were evaluated at an on-site test area located approximately one mile from the plant. Rocketdyne closed the plant in 1968. The plant has been used by several different companies for the refurbishment of jet aircraft engines. The citizens of Neosho have placed a commemorative monument dedicated to the men and women of Rocketdyne Neosho &quot;whose tireless efforts and relentless pursuit of quality resulted in the world&#x27;s finest liquid rocket engines.&quot;

===Nevada Field Laboratory===
Rocketdyne established and operated a 120,000 acre rocket engine test and development facility nearby Reno, Nevada from 1962 until 1970. The Nevada Field Laboratory had three active open-air test facilities and two administrative areas. The test facilities were used for the Gemini and Apollo space programs, the annular aerospike engine and the early (proposal-stage) development of the Space Shuttle main engine.
==Power generation==
In addition to its primary business of building rocket engines, Rocketdyne has developed power generation and control systems. These included early nuclear power generation experiments, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), and solar power equipment, including the main power system for the International Space Station.

In the Boeing sale to Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Power Systems division of Rocketdyne was transferred to Hamilton Sundstrand, another subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation.

<text>The polycystines are a group of radiolarians. They include the vast majority of the fossil radiolaria, as their skeletons are abundant in marine sediments, making them one of the most common groups of microfossils. These skeletons are composed of opaline silica. In some it takes the form of relatively simple spicules, but in others it forms more elaborate lattices, such as concentric spheres with radial spines or sequences of conical chambers. Two of the orders belonging to this group are the radially-symmetrical Spumellaria, dating back to the late Cambrian period, and the bilaterally-symmetrical Nasselaria, whose origin is placed within the lower Devonian.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, a tug of war tournament was contested. Each team consisted of 8 athletes. Nations could enter up to 3 teams. The host Great Britain was the only one to enter more than one (entering the maximum of 3 teams). Germany, Greece, Sweden, and the United States each entered one team apiece, though Germany and Greece withdrew. This left 5 teams (40 athletes) from 3 nations to compete.

<doc id="320890" wikidata="Q3766392" url="?curid=320890" title="Winnie-the-Pooh (book)">
<text>Winnie-the-Pooh is a 1926 children&#x27;s book by English author A. A. Milne and English illustrator E. H. Shepard. The book is set in the fictional Hundred Acre Wood, with a collection of short stories following the adventures of an anthropomorphic teddy bear, Winnie-the-Pooh, and his friends Christopher Robin, Piglet, Eeyore, Owl, Rabbit, Kanga, and Roo. It is the first of two story collections by Milne about Winnie-the-Pooh, the second being &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (1928). Milne and Shepard collaborated previously for English humour magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, and in 1924 created &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, a poetry collection. Among the characters in the poetry book was a teddy bear Shepard modelled after his son&#x27;s toy. Following this, Shepard encouraged Milne to write about his son Christopher Robin Milne&#x27;s toys, and so they became the inspiration for the characters in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;.

The book was published on 14 October 1926, and was both well-received by critics and a commercial success, selling 150,000 copies before the end of the year. Critical analysis of the book has held that it represents a rural Arcadia, separated from real-world issues or problems, and is without purposeful subtext. More recently, criticism has been levelled at the lack of positive female characters (i.e. that the only female character, Kanga, is depicted as a bad mother).

&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; has been translated into over fifty languages; a 1958 Latin translation, &quot;Winnie ille Pu&quot;, was the first foreign-language book to be featured on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List, and the only book in Latin ever to have been featured. The stories and characters in the book have been adapted in other media, most notably into a franchise by The Walt Disney Company, beginning with &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;, released on 4 February 1966 as a double feature with &quot;The Ugly Dachshund&quot;. It remains protected under copyright in other countries, including the UK.

== Background and publication ==
Before writing &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, A. A. Milne was already a successful writer. He wrote for English humour magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, had published a mystery novel, &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; (1922), and was a playwright. Milne began writing poetry for children after being asked by fellow &quot;Punch&quot; contributor, Rose Fyleman. Milne compiled his first verses for publishing, and though his publishers were initially hesitant to publish children&#x27;s poetry, the poetry collection &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; (1924) was a success. The illustrations were done by artist and fellow &quot;Punch&quot; staff E. H. Shepard.
Among the characters in &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot; was a teddy bear that Shepard modelled after one belonging to his son. With the book&#x27;s success, Shepard encouraged Milne to write stories about Milne&#x27;s young son, Christopher Robin Milne, and his stuffed toys. Among Christopher&#x27;s toys was a teddy bear he called &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. Christopher got the name &quot;Winnie&quot; from a bear at the London Zoo, Winnipeg. &quot;Pooh&quot; was the name of a swan in &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;. Milne used Christopher and his toys as inspiration for a series of short stories, which were compiled and published as &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. The model for Pooh remained the bear belonging to Shepard&#x27;s son.

&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; was published on 14 October 1926 by Methuen &amp; Co. in England and E. P. Dutton in the United States. As a work first published in 1926, the book entered the public domain in the United States on 1 January 2022. British copyright of the text expires on 1 January 2027 (70 calendar years after Milne&#x27;s death) while British copyright of the illustrations expires on 1 January 2047 (70 calendar years after Shepard&#x27;s death).

==Stories==

Some of the stories in &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; were adapted by Milne from previous published writings in &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and other periodicals. The first chapter, for instance, was adapted from &quot;The Wrong Sort of Bees&quot;, a story published in the &quot;London Evening News&quot; in its issue for Christmas Eve 1925. Classics scholar Ross Kilpatrick contended in 1998 that Milne adapted the first chapter from &quot;Teddy Bear&#x27;s Bee Tree&quot;, published in 1912 in &quot;Babes in the Woods&quot; by Charles G. D. Roberts.

The stories in the book can be read independently. The plots do not carry over between stories (with the exception of Stories 9 and 10).

# &quot;In Which We Are Introduced to Winnie the Pooh and Some Bees and the Stories Begin&quot;: 
#* Winnie-the-Pooh is out of honey, so he tries to climb a tree to get some, but falls off, bouncing on branches on his way down. He meets with his friend Christopher Robin and floats up with a balloon of Christopher&#x27;s, only to discover they are not the right sort of bees for honey. Christopher then shoots the balloon with his gun, letting Pooh slowly float back down.
# &quot;In Which Pooh Goes Visiting and Gets into a Tight Place&quot;: 
#* Pooh visits Rabbit, but eats so much while in Rabbit&#x27;s house that he gets stuck in Rabbit&#x27;s door on the way out. Christopher Robin reads him a book for a week and, having not had any meals, Pooh is slim enough to be pulled out by Christopher, Rabbit, and Rabbit&#x27;s friends and extended family.
# &quot;In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle&quot;: 
#* After it snows Pooh and Piglet track increasing numbers of footsteps round and round a stand of trees believing it is an aggressive creature. However, when Christopher Robin points it out Pooh and Piglet realise that they are following their own footsteps.
# &quot;In Which Eeyore Loses a Tail and Pooh Finds One&quot;: 
#* Pooh sets out to find Eeyore&#x27;s missing tail, and visits Owl&#x27;s place. Owl suggests putting up posters and offering a reward, before asking what Pooh thinks about his bell-rope. They realise that Owl has taken Eeyore&#x27;s tail by accident and Christopher Robin nails it back on.
# &quot;In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump&quot;: 
#* Piglet and Pooh try to trap a Heffalump, using honey as a bait, but Pooh ends up getting stuck in the hole himself with the honey jar on his head. Piglet is convinced that Pooh is a Heffalump and calls Christopher Robin, who quickly realizes it is Pooh and laughs.
# &quot;In Which Eeyore has a Birthday and Gets Two Presents&quot;: 
#* Pooh feels bad that no one has gotten Eeyore anything for his birthday, so he and Piglet try their best to get him presents. Piglet accidentally pops Eeyore&#x27;s balloon and Pooh brings Eeyore a honey jar which Owl has written Happy Birthday on. Eeyore ends up being happy with this present.
# &quot;In Which Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest and Piglet Has a Bath&quot;: 
#* Rabbit convinces Pooh and Piglet to try to kidnap newcomer Baby Roo to convince newcomer Kanga to leave the forest. They switch Roo for Piglet and Kanga pretends to mistake Piglet for Roo and makes him take a cold bath. Christopher Robin eventually points out the mistake she has made. Kanga and Roo decide to continue living in the forest.
# &quot;In Which Christopher Robin Leads an to the North Pole&quot;: 
#* Christopher Robin and all of the animals in the forest go on a quest to find the North Pole in the Hundred Acre Wood. Roo falls into the river and Pooh helps him out using a pole. Christopher Robin announces Pooh has found the North Pole and puts a sign down dedicated to him.
# &quot;In Which Piglet Is Entirely Surrounded by Water&quot;: 
#* Piglet is trapped in his home by a flood, so he sends a message out in a bottle in hope of rescue. Pooh stays at home, eventually runs out of honey, and then uses the empty jars as a makeshift boat. After Pooh meets Christopher Robin, they set off in a boat made of an umbrella named &quot;The Brain of Pooh&quot; and the pair rescue Piglet.
# &quot;In Which Christopher Robin Gives Pooh a Party and We Say Goodbye&quot;: 
#* Christopher Robin gives Pooh a party for helping to rescue Piglet during the flood. Pooh gets a pencil case as a present. The author then promises to tell Christopher Robin more stories later.

== Reception ==
The book was a critical and commercial success; Dutton sold 150,000 copies before the end of the year. First editions of &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; were published in low numbers. Methuen &amp; Co. published 100 copies in large size, signed and numbered. E. P. Dutton issued 500 copies of which only 100 were signed by Milne. The book is Milne&#x27;s best-selling work; the author and literary critic John Rowe Townsend described &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; and its sequel &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; as &quot;the spectacular British success of the 1920s&quot; and praised its light, readable prose.

Contemporary reviews of the book were generally positive. A review in &quot;The Elementary English Review&quot; reviewed the book positively, describing it as containing &quot;delightful nonsense&quot; and &quot;unbelievably funny&quot; illustrations. In 2003, &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; was listed at number 7 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read, a survey of the British public to determine their favourite books. In 2012 it was ranked number 26 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

== Analysis ==
Townsend describes Milne&#x27;s Pooh works as being &quot;as totally without hidden significance as anything written.&quot; In 1963 Frederick Crews published &quot;The Pooh Perplex&quot;, a satire of literary criticism that contains essays by fake authors on &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;. The book is introduced as trying to make sense of &quot;one of the greatest books ever written&quot; on the meaning of which &quot;nobody can quite agree&quot;. Crews&#x27; book had a chilling effect on any substantive analysis of the book, particularly for the ten years following its publication.

Although &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; was published shortly after the end of the First World War, it takes place in an isolated world free from major issues, which scholar Paula T. Connolly describes as &quot;largely Edenic&quot; and later as an Arcadia standing in stark contrast to the world in which the book was created. She goes on to describe the book as nostalgic for a &quot;rural and innocent world&quot;. The book was published towards the end of an era when writing fantasy works for children was very popular, sometimes referred to as the Golden Age of Children&#x27;s Literature.

In Alison Lurie&#x27;s 1990 essay on &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, she argues that its popularity, despite its simplicity, comes from its &quot;universal appeal&quot; to people who find themselves at a &quot;social disadvantage,&quot; and gives kids as one obvious example of this. The power and wise status that Christopher Robin receives, she claims, also appeals to children. Lurie draws a parallel from the setting of an environment that feels small and is devoid of aggression, with most of the activities involving exploring, to Milne&#x27;s childhood, which he spent at a small suburban same-sex school. In addition, the rural backdrop without cars and roads is similar to his life as a child in Essex and Kent, before the start of the 20th century. She argues that the characters have widespread appeal because they draw from Milne&#x27;s own life, and contain common feelings and personalities found in childhood, such as gloominess (Eeyore) and shyness (Piglet).

In Carol Stranger&#x27;s feminist analysis of the book, she criticises this idea, arguing that, since every character other than Kanga is male, Lurie must believe that the &quot;male experience is universal.&quot; The main critique, however, that Stranger levels is that Kanga, the only female character and the mother of Roo, is consistently made out as negative and a bad mother, citing a passage in which Kanga mistakes Piglet for Roo and threatens to put soap in his mouth if he resists taking a cold bath. This, she claims, forces female readers either to identify themselves with Kanga, and &quot;call up the dependency, the pain, vulnerability and disappointment&quot; many babies feel towards their caregivers, or to identify with the male characters, and see Kanga as cruel. She also notes that Christopher Robin&#x27;s mother is mentioned only in the dedication.

== Translations ==
The work has been translated into 72 languages, including Afrikaans, Czech, Finnish and Yiddish. The Latin translation by the Hungarian Lénárd Sándor (Alexander Lenard), &quot;Winnie ille Pu&quot;, was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the first foreign-language book to be featured on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List, and the only book in Latin ever to have been featured therein. It was also translated into Esperanto in 1972, by Ivy Kellerman Reed and Ralph A. Lewin, &quot;Winnie-La-Pu&quot;. The work was featured in the iBooks app for Apple&#x27;s iOS as the &quot;starter&quot; book for the app.

&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; also received two Polish translations, which vastly differed in their interpretation of the work. Irena Tuwim published the first translation of the work in 1938, titled &quot;&quot;. This version prioritized adopting Polish language and culture over a direct translation, which was well received by readers. The second translation, titled &quot;Fredzia Phi-Phi&quot;, was published by Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska in 1986. Adamczyk-Garbowska&#x27;s version was more faithful to the original text, but was widely criticized by Polish readers and scholars, including Robert Stiller and Stanisław Lem. Lem harshly described Tuwim&#x27;s easy-to-read translation as being &quot;castrated&quot; by Adamczyk-Garbowska. The titular character&#x27;s new Polish name, &quot;Fredzia Phi-Phi&quot;, also drew criticism from readers who assumed Adamczyk-Garbowska had changed Pooh&#x27;s gender by using a female name. Many of the new character names were also seen as being overly complicated compared to Tuwim&#x27;s version. Adamczyk-Garbowska defended her translation, stating that she simply wanted to convey Milne&#x27;s linguistic subtleties that were not present in the first translation.

==Legacy==

In 2018, five works of original art from the book sold for £917,500, including a map of the Hundred Acre Wood that sold for £430,000 and set a record for the most expensive book illustration.

===Sequels===
====Milne and Shepard authored====
Milne and Shepard went on to collaborate on two more books: &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; (1927) and &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; (1928). &quot;Now We Are Six&quot; is a poetry volume like &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, and includes some poetry about Winnie-the-Pooh. &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; is a second volume of stories about Pooh, and introduces the character Tigger. Milne never wrote another &quot;Pooh&quot; book, and died in 1956. Penguin Books has called &quot;When We Were Very Young&quot;, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;, and &quot;The House At Pooh Corner&quot; &quot;the basis of the entire &quot;Pooh&quot; canon.&quot;
====Authorized====
The first authorized &quot;Pooh&quot; book after Milne&#x27;s death was &quot;Return to the Hundred Acre Wood&quot; in 2009, by David Benedictus. It was written with the full backing of Milne&#x27;s estate, which took the trustees ten years to agree to. In the story, a new character, Lottie the Otter, is introduced. The illustrations are by Mark Burgess. The next authorized sequel, &quot;The Best Bear in All The World&quot;, was published in 2016 by Egmont. It was written by Paul Bright, Jeanne Willis, Kate Saunders and Brian Sibley with illustrations again by Mark Burgess. The four authors each wrote a short story about one of the seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.

===Adaptations===
Following The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s licensing of certain rights to Pooh from Stephen Slesinger and the A. A. Milne Estate in the 1960s, the Milne storylines were used by Disney in its cartoon featurette &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree&quot;. The &quot;look&quot; of Pooh was adapted by Disney from Stephen Slesinger&#x27;s distinctive American Pooh with his famous red shirt that had been created and used in commerce by Slesinger since the 1930s.

Parts of the book were adapted to three Russian-language short animated films directed by Fyodor Khitruk: &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; (based on chapter 1), &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh Pays a Visit&quot; (based on chapter 2), and &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh and a Busy Day&quot; (based on chapters 4 and 6)&quot;.&quot;

In 2022, Jagged Edge Productions announced that a horror film starring the character was put in production, and was released on February 15, 2023. This production became possible after the book became public domain in the United States. A sequel was released in 2024.

===Passage into the public domain===

&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;″s entrance into the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2022 was noted by several news publications, generally in the context of a greater Public Domain Day article. The book entered the public domain in Canada in 2007. The UK copyright will expire at the end of 2026, the 70th year since Milne&#x27;s death. As Shepard lived until 1976, the UK copyright on his illustrations will remain in effect until 2047.

<text>The Columbia River Gorge is a canyon of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Up to deep, the canyon stretches for over as the river winds westward through the Cascade Range, forming the boundary between the state of Washington to the north and Oregon to the south. Extending roughly from the confluence of the Columbia with the Deschutes River (and the towns of Roosevelt, Washington, and Arlington, Oregon) in the east down to the eastern reaches of the Portland metropolitan area, the water gap furnishes the only navigable route through the Cascades and the only water connection between the Columbia Plateau and the Pacific Ocean. It is thus that the routes of Interstate 84, U.S. Route 30, Washington State Route 14, and railroad tracks on both sides run through the gorge.

A popular recreational destination, the gorge holds federally protected status as the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and is managed by the Columbia River Gorge Commission and the U.S. Forest Service.

==Description==
The Columbia River, Klamath River in northern California, Pit River in northern California, and Fraser River in southern British Columbia are the only four rivers connecting the watersheds on the east side of the Cascade Range to the Pacific Ocean. Each river has carved out a gorge through the Cascades. The Columbia River Gorge marks the state line between Oregon and Washington, and its wide range of elevation and precipitation makes it an extremely diverse and dynamic place. Ranging from to sea level, and transitioning from of precipitation to only in , the gorge provides the setting for a diverse collection of ecosystems, from the temperate rain forest on the western end—with an average annual precipitation of —to the eastern grasslands with average annual precipitation between , to a transitional dry woodland between Hood River and The Dalles. Isolated micro-habitats have allowed for many species of endemic plants and animals to prosper, including at least 13 endemic wildflowers.
The gorge transitions between temperate rainforest to dry grasslands in only , hosting a dramatic change in scenery while driving along Interstate 84. In the western, temperate rainforest areas, forests are marked by bigleaf maples, Douglas fir, and western hemlock, all covered in epiphytes. In the transition zone (between Hood River and The Dalles), vegetation turns to Oregon white oak, ponderosa pine, and cottonwood. At the eastern end, the forests make way for expansive grasslands, with occasional pockets of lodgepole and ponderosa pine.

Atmospheric pressure differentials east and west of the Cascades create a wind tunnel effect in the deep cut of the gorge, generating winds that make it a popular windsurfing and kiteboarding location. It also creates the right conditions for snow and ice storms during the winter months which also draw very cold east winds toward the mouth of the gorge on the west end.

The gorge is a popular destination for hiking, biking, sightseeing, fishing, and water sports. The area is known for its high concentration of waterfalls, with over 90 on the Oregon side of the gorge alone. Many are along the Historic Columbia River Highway, including the notable Multnomah Falls.

Trails and day use sites are maintained by the Forest Service and many Oregon and Washington state parks.

==Geology==
The Columbia River Gorge began forming as far back as the Miocene (roughly 17 to 12 million years ago), and continued to take shape through the Pleistocene (2 million to 700,000 years ago). During this period the Cascade Range was forming, which slowly moved the Columbia River&#x27;s delta about north to its current location.

Although the river slowly eroded the land over this period of time, the most drastic changes took place at the end of the last ice age when the Missoula Floods cut the steep, dramatic walls that exist today, flooding the river as high up as Crown Point. This quick erosion left many layers of volcanic rock exposed.

==Ecology==
The Columbia River Gorge is home to a number of plant species that are endemic or found mostly in the gorge and surrounding areas, including &quot;Heterotheca villosa&quot;, &quot;Lomatium columbianum&quot;, &quot;Lomatium klickitatense&quot;, &quot;Lomatium suksdorfii&quot;, &quot;Penstemon barrettiae&quot;, and &quot;Primula poetica&quot;.

==History==
The gorge has supported human habitation for over 13,000 years. Evidence of the Folsom and Marmes people, who crossed the Bering land bridge from Asia, were found in archaeological digs. Excavations near Celilo Falls, a few miles east of The Dalles, show humans have occupied this salmon-fishing site for more than 10,000 years.

The gorge has provided a transportation corridor for thousands of years. Native Americans would travel through the gorge to trade at Celilo Falls, both along the river and over Lolo Pass on the north side of Mount Hood. In 1805, the route was used by the Lewis and Clark Expedition to reach the Pacific. Early European and American settlers subsequently established steamboat lines and railroads through the gorge. Today, the BNSF Railway runs freights along the Washington side of the river, while its rival, the Union Pacific Railroad, runs freights along the Oregon shore. Until 1997, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer&quot; also used the Union Pacific tracks. The Portland segment of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; uses the BNSF tracks that pass through the gorge.

The Columbia River Highway, built in the early 20th century, was the first major paved highway in the Pacific Northwest. Shipping was greatly simplified after Bonneville Dam and The Dalles Dam submerged the gorge&#x27;s major rapids such as Celilo Falls, a major salmon fishing site for local Native Americans until the site&#x27;s submergence in 1957.

In November 1986, Congress made the gorge the second U.S. National Scenic Area and established the Columbia River Gorge Commission as part of an interstate compact. The experimental designation came in lieu of being recognized as a national park, which would require the existing industries in towns along the river to relocate. The designation was initially opposed by residents fearing government encroachment, due to restrictions in the plan for items such as building paint colors, and was also opposed by conservationists who feared additional development in the region. In 2004, the gorge became the namesake of the Columbia Gorge American Viticultural Area, a area located on both sides of the river.

In fall 2017, the Eagle Creek Fire burned in the gorge for three months, consuming almost . It reached 100% containment on November 30, 2017, but was not yet completely out.

<text>The longfin escolar, &quot;Scombrolabrax heterolepis&quot;, also known as the black mackerel, is a widespread but uncommon deep sea ray-finned fish that presents some difficulties for taxonomy.

It is placed in its own family Scombrolabracidae, but the family&#x27;s placement in the suborders of Perciformes has included Scombroidei, Percoidei, and Trichiuroidei, while some authors place it in its own suborder Scombrolabracoidei and even in its own order the Scombrolabraciformes.

The fish bears some resemblance to members of Gempylidae, but has protrusible premaxillae, serrated opercles and preopercles, and a spur on the lowest principal caudal ray, all of which are characteristic of percoids. Its color varies from black to dark brown. This fish is known to grow to 30 cm in length. The body is covered in soft scales which easily slough off when handled. The eyes are large with usually a single pair of elongated teeth in the middle of the top jaw.

The longfin escolar is unique among fishes for having several of its vertebrae hollowed out and filled by evaginations of the gas bladder. It is most often encountered as a bycatch species in pelagic longline fisheries.

<text>The Chalet School is a series of 58 school story novels by Elinor M. Brent-Dyer, initially published between 1925 and 1970. The fictional school was initially located in the Austrian Tyrol, before it was moved to Guernsey in 1939 following the rise to power of the Nazi Party, and again to Herefordshire following the Nazi invasion of the Channel Islands. It later moved to a fictional island off the coast of Wales, and finally to Switzerland.

==Plot==
The Chalet School is founded in 1925 by Madge Bettany when her brother has to return to his job in the Forestry Commission in India. She comes to the conclusion that starting a school would be a convenient way to generate some much-needed income, while also looking after her sickly younger sister Joey. Finding that suitable locations in England would be too expensive for her plans, she decides to look abroad, and finally settles on a large chalet in the Austrian Tyrol, conveniently providing a helpful climate for Joey&#x27;s recuperation. Within a few years a sanatorium is built not far from the school, where tuberculosis patients convalesce. The founder, Dr Jem Russell, along with Dr Jack Maynard, provides assistance to members of the school and the two Doctors eventually marry Madge and Joey respectively. Robin Humphries is also a main character, until she leaves the Chalet school to go to Oxford and later becomes a nun. The books then follow a variety of characters, including Daisy Venables, Bride Bettany and Gay Lambert, until Mary-Lou Trelawney comes to the school, and becomes the main character for several books. After she leaves school, in the later books, Joey&#x27;s triplets become main characters.

Throughout the series, various girls arrive at the school with personal problems, bad attitudes or behavioural issues. As a result of the ministrations of better-behaved classmates and the school mistresses, they tend to discover the error of their ways and become model pupils. This formula of a troublesome new girl who reforms and conforms is most common in the later books.

==Reception==
As with contemporary series of school stories by other authors, the Chalet School books acquired a following of readers who tried to collect each new novel as it came out. Its more exotic setting set it slightly apart from other British series in the same genre. It is the longest of any such novel series.

==Book details==

===Hardback===
Chalet School books were originally published in hardback between 1925 and 1970 by W. &amp; R. Chambers.

===Paperback===
The novels were reissued in paperback format between 1967 and 1995. Usually with updated language. Some were more or less uncut, but many others were abridged to various extents, including chapters deleted from some titles. A few were split into two paperback volumes, and several were retitled.
===Additional books===
===Books by other authors===

Many authors have written books set in the Chalet School universe. Some of them are set before the Chalet School is founded, some of them follow on from the last book of the series, and others attempt to fill in some of the &quot;gaps&quot; in the earlier years of the school. All books are published by Girls Gone By Publishers (formerly Friends of the Chalet School) unless otherwise stated.
