<text>Bad Santa is a 2003 American Christmas black comedy crime film directed by Terry Zwigoff, written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, and starring Billy Bob Thornton in the title role, with a supporting cast of Tony Cox, Lauren Graham, Brett Kelly, Lauren Tom, John Ritter, and Bernie Mac. It was Ritter&#x27;s last live-action film appearance before his death on September 11, 2003. The film was dedicated to his memory. The Coen brothers are credited as executive producers. The film was released in North America on November 26, 2003, and was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It received positive reviews and was a commercial success.

An unrated version was released on DVD on March 5, 2004, and on Blu-ray on November 20, 2007, as &quot;Bad(der) Santa&quot;. A director&#x27;s cut DVD was released in November 2006; it features Zwigoff&#x27;s cut of the film (including an audio commentary with him and the film&#x27;s editor), which is three minutes shorter than the theatrical cut and ten minutes shorter than the unrated version. A sequel, &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot;, was released on November 23, 2016, and failed to match the critical and commercial success of the original.

==Plot==

Willie T. Soke and his dwarf assistant Marcus Skidmore are professional thieves. Every year, Willie gets a job as a department store Santa Claus and Marcus as an elf to rob shopping malls on the night of Christmas Eve, with Marcus&#x27; wife Lois as their getaway driver. Marcus takes his job seriously, but Willie, a sex-addicted cursing alcoholic and drug addict, is steadily unable to perform with children.

When they are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, Willie&#x27;s vulgarity shocks the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska, who brings them to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel. At the mall, Willie is visited by Thurman Merman, a friendly but exceedingly gullible, dimwitted young boy who believes he really is Santa and is constantly bullied by a teenage gang of skateboarders. At a bar, Willie meets Sue, a bartender with a fetish for Santa Claus, and they begin a sexual relationship.

After having casual sex with Sue in his beaten-up Impala, Willie is harassed and attacked by a man he had encountered earlier at the bar, but Thurman intervenes. Willie gives the boy a ride home, where he lives with his senile grandmother. Thurman reveals that his mother died and claims his father, Roger, is out &quot;exploring the mountains&quot; (though he is actually in jail for embezzlement). Willie tricks him into letting him rob their safe and steals Roger&#x27;s BMW 740iL.

Bob overhears Willie having sex in a dressing room and sends Gin, who starts to investigate. After Willie sees his motel room being raided, he moves into Thurman&#x27;s house, much to his delight. Marcus is angry at Willie for taking advantage of Thurman and disapproves of his sex addiction. Gin visits Roger, who inadvertently reveals that Willie is staying with Thurman illegally. Confronting Willie and Marcus, he tells them he has uncovered their plan, blackmailing them for half the score to keep silent.

Willie and Marcus’ partnership begins to falter, further exacerbated when Willie shows up to work drunk, destroying the Santa attraction. Willie, about to commit suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes, gives Thurman a letter of confession for the police, including his misdeeds and the heist planned for Christmas Eve. However, he sees Thurman&#x27;s black eye and abandons the suicide attempt to confront the skateboarders; he assaults their leader, intimidating them to leave Thurman alone.

Furious at Gin&#x27;s blackmail, Marcus and Lois set a trap for him. Feigning the need for a jump-start, Lois hits Gin with the car, crushing him between vehicles. When this fails to kill Gin, Marcus finishes him off by shocking him with jumper cables. Willie and Thurman prepare for the approaching holiday with help from Sue. On Christmas Eve, Willie, Marcus, and Lois raid the mall; although some technical difficulties arise, Willie successfully cracks the safe. He also gets a pink stuffed elephant that Thurman wants for Christmas. However, Marcus reveals to Willie that he intends to kill him, fed up with his increasing carelessness. As he is about to execute Willie, the police unexpectedly swarm in, tipped off by Willie&#x27;s letter that he gave Thurman. A firefight ensues between Marcus and the cops while Willie flees. Determined to give Thurman his present, he leads the police on a chase to his house, ignoring their orders to freeze. He is shot repeatedly on Thurman&#x27;s porch but survives.

An epilogue is told through a letter from a recovering Willie in the hospital. He expresses his gratitude to Thurman and reveals that he was cleared of the robbery—as the shooting of an unarmed Santa had embarrassed the police—and will be working for them as a sensitivity counselor. Sue is granted guardianship over Thurman and his house until his father&#x27;s release. Marcus and Lois are in prison; Willie ends the letter by hoping that Roger will avoid them and telling Thurman that he should be out of the hospital soon and to be ready for his return. When the skateboard gang leader harasses Thurman again, Thurman finally stands up to him by kicking him hard in the crotch and riding away on his bike, giving the downed bully the finger.

==Cast==
==Production==
In January 2002, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Terry Zwigoff would be directing &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (his fourth picture and follow-up to &quot;Ghost World&quot;) under Dimension Films, with Glenn Ficarra and John Requa writing the screenplay and the Coen brothers serving as executive producers.

The Coens had developed the concept for &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, before eventually hiring the writing team of Ficarra and Requa to bring the story to life. The Coens told Ficarra and Requa that the story would center on an alcoholic &quot;bad Santa&quot; who seeks redemption very later on; additionally, they wanted it to be as funny as &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;. Afterward, Ficarra and Requa completed what they described as a &quot;really crass script&quot;, with the Coens adding &quot;a bunch of crass jokes&quot;. When the script&#x27;s final draft was sent to Universal Pictures, the studio rejected it because &quot;[I]t was the foulest, disgusting, misogynistic, anti-Christmas, anti-children thing we could imagine,&quot; all of which influenced Bob Weinstein of Miramax Films (Dimension&#x27;s parent company) to give it the green-light.

===Casting===
The Coens initially tailored roles for specific actors, such as James Gandolfini as Willie (since they had worked with him on &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;), Danny Woodburn as Marcus, and Angus T. Jones as Thurman. Bill Murray, Jack Nicholson, and Robert De Niro were also considered for the role of Willie, but it eventually went to Billy Bob Thornton. Mickey Rooney auditioned for the role of Marcus. Zwigoff cast Tony Cox for the role of Marcus and Brett Kelly for Thurman, which led to disagreements between himself and the producers. Upon learning of Cox&#x27;s casting, the Coens told Weinstein that they &quot;hate&quot; him, and according to Zwigoff, Dimension was pining for &quot;a more Disney-like generic cute kid&quot; to play Thurman. &quot;Maybe there are other actors who could do a great job with these parts. But Tony and Brett are just funny. They are these characters,&quot; explained Zwigoff.

===Filming===

The movie was filmed in various parts of California. Filming began on July 8, 2002, and ended in September 2002. The &quot;Miami Beach&quot; sequence at the beginning of the movie was filmed in Long Beach, while all of the scenes at Thurman&#x27;s house were filmed in West Hills. All of the Saguaro Square Mall scenes were filmed entirely in the northeastern wing of Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, particularly in the former Montgomery Ward building, which was used for the mall&#x27;s fictional anchor store, &quot;Chamberlain&#x27;s&quot;. The store and the entire wing were both vacant at the time of the movie&#x27;s filming. The wing and building where the movie was filmed have since been demolished and replaced with the mall&#x27;s new open-air lifestyle center.

==Reception==
===Box office===

The film grossed over $60 million domestically and more than $76 million in total worldwide.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Bad Santa&quot; has rating, based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A gloriously rude and gleefully offensive comedy, &quot;Bad Santa&quot; isn&#x27;t for everyone, but grinches will find it uproariously funny.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 70 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a &quot;B&quot; grade on an A+ to F scale.

An editorial in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; likened the movie to an &quot;evil twin&quot; of &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and chided The Walt Disney Company for allowing such a beloved figure as Santa Claus to be trashed by Miramax Films, then a Disney subsidiary.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film stars out of four, writing how &quot;Bad Santa&quot; was a &quot;demented, twisted [and] unreasonably funny work of comic kamikaze style&quot;.

==Sequel==

On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Billy Bob Thornton would return for &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot;, and that filming would begin in Montreal in January 2016 for a scheduled release of Christmas 2016. On November 3, 2015, it was announced that &quot;Mean Girls&quot; director Mark Waters would direct the film. On November 19, 2015, it was announced that Kathy Bates would join the cast as Willie&#x27;s mother, and that Brett Kelly and Tony Cox would reprise their roles from the first film. On December 21, 2015, it was announced that &quot;Bad Santa 2&quot; would be released on November 23, 2016. On January 6, 2016, Christina Hendricks joined the cast.

<doc id="320498" wikidata="Q796573" url="?curid=320498" title="Computer-mediated communication">
<text>Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is defined as any human communication that occurs through the use of two or more electronic devices. While the term has traditionally referred to those communications that occur via computer-mediated formats (e.g., instant messaging, email, chat rooms, online forums, social network services), it has also been applied to other forms of text-based interaction such as text messaging. Research on CMC focuses largely on the social effects of different computer-supported communication technologies. Many recent studies involve Internet-based social networking supported by social software.

== Forms ==

Computer-mediated communication can be broken down into two forms: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication that occurs in real-time. All parties are engaged in the communication simultaneously; however, they are not necessarily all in the same location. Examples of synchronous communication are video chats and audio calls. On the other hand, asynchronous computer-mediated communication refers to communication that takes place when the parties engaged are not communicating in unison. In other words, the sender does not receive an immediate response from the receiver. Most forms of computer-mediated technology are asynchronous. Examples of asynchronous communication are text messages and emails.

== Scope ==

Scholars from a variety of fields study phenomena that can be described under the umbrella term of computer-mediated communication (CMC) (see also Internet studies). For example, many take a sociopsychological approach to CMC by examining how humans use &quot;computers&quot; (or digital media) to manage interpersonal interaction, form impressions and maintain relationships. These studies have often focused on the differences between online and offline interactions, though contemporary research is moving towards the view that CMC should be studied as embedded in everyday life. Another branch of CMC research examines the use of paralinguistic features such as emoticons, pragmatic rules such as turn-taking and the sequential analysis and organization of talk, and the various sociolects, styles, registers or sets of terminology specific to these environments (see Leet). The study of language in these contexts is typically based on text-based forms of CMC, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;computer-mediated discourse analysis&quot;.

The way humans communicate in professional, social, and educational settings varies widely, depending upon not only the environment but also the method of communication in which the communication occurs, which in this case is through computers or other information and communication technologies (ICTs). The study of communication to achieve collaboration—common work products—is termed computer-supported collaboration and includes only some of the concerns of other forms of CMC research.

Popular forms of CMC include e-mail, video, audio or text chat (text conferencing including &quot;instant messaging&quot;), bulletin board systems, list-servs, and MMOs. These settings are changing rapidly with the development of new technologies. Weblogs (blogs) have also become popular, and the exchange of RSS data has better enabled users to each &quot;become their own publisher&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Communication occurring within a computer-mediated format has an effect on many different aspects of an interaction. Some of those that have received attention in the scholarly literature include impression formation, deception, group dynamics, disclosure reciprocity, disinhibition and especially relationship formation.

CMC is examined and compared to other communication media through a number of aspects thought to be universal to all forms of communication, including (but not limited to) synchronicity, persistence or &quot;recordability&quot;, and anonymity. The association of these aspects with different forms of communication varies widely. For example, instant messaging is intrinsically synchronous but not persistent, since one loses all the content when one closes the dialog box unless one has a message log set up or has manually copy-pasted the conversation. E-mail and message boards, on the other hand, are low in synchronicity since response time varies, but high in persistence since messages sent and received are saved. Properties that separate CMC from other media also include transience, its multimodal nature, and its relative lack of governing codes of conduct. CMC is able to overcome physical and social limitations of other forms of communication and therefore allow the interaction of people who are not physically sharing the same space.

Technology would be a powerful tool when defining communication as a learning process that needs a sender and receiver. According to Nicholas Jankowski in his book The Contours of Multimedia, a third party, like software, acts in the middle between a sender and receiver. The sender is interacting with this third party to send. The receiver interacts with it as well, creating an additional interaction with the medium itself along with the initially intended one between sender and receiver.

The medium in which people choose to communicate influences the extent to which people disclose personal information. CMC is marked by higher levels of self-disclosure in conversation as opposed to face-to-face interactions. Self disclosure is any verbal communication of personally relevant information, thought, and feeling which establishes and maintains interpersonal relationships. This is due in part to visual anonymity and the absence of nonverbal cues which reduce concern for losing positive face. According to Walther’s (1996) hyperpersonal communication model, computer-mediated communication is valuable in providing a better communication and better first impressions. Moreover, Ramirez and Zhang (2007) indicate that computer-mediated communication allows more closeness and attraction between two individuals than a face-to-face communication. Online impression management, self-disclosure, attentiveness, expressivity, composure and other skills contribute to competence in computer mediated communication. In fact, there is a considerable correspondence of skills in computer-mediated and face-to-face interaction even though there is great diversity of online communication tools.

Anonymity and in part privacy and security depends more on the context and particular program being used or web page being visited. However, most researchers in the field acknowledge the importance of considering the psychological and social implications of these factors alongside the technical &quot;limitations&quot;.

== Language learning ==

CMC is widely discussed in language learning because CMC provides opportunities for language learners to practice their language. For example, Warschauer conducted several case studies on using email or discussion boards in different language classes. Warschauer claimed that information and communications technology “bridge the historic divide between speech...and writing”. Thus, considerable concern has arisen over the reading and writing research in L2 due to the booming of the Internet. In the learning process, students, especially kids, need cognitive learning, but they also need social interaction, which enhances their psychological needs. Although technology has its powerful effect in assisting the English language learners to learn, it can not be a comprehensive way that covers different aspects of the learning process.

== Benefits ==
The nature of CMC means that it is easy for individuals to engage in communication with others regardless of time, location, or other spatial constraints to communication. In that CMC allows for individuals to collaborate on projects that would otherwise be impossible due to such factors as geography, it has enhanced social interaction not only between individuals but also in working life. In addition, CMC can also be useful for allowing individuals who might be intimidated due to factors like character or disabilities to participate in communication. By allowing an individual to communicate in a location of their choosing, a CMC call allows a person to engage in communication with minimal stress. Making an individual comfortable through CMC also plays a role in self-disclosure, which allows a communicative partner to open up more easily and be more expressive. When communicating through an electronic medium, individuals are less likely to engage in stereotyping and are less self-conscious about physical characteristics. The role that anonymity plays in online communication can also encourage some users to be less defensive and form relationships with others more rapidly.

== Disadvantages ==
While computer-mediated communication can be beneficial, technological mediation can also inhibit the communication process. Unlike face-to-face communication, nonverbal cues such as tone and physical gestures, which assist in conveying the message, are lost through computer-mediated communication. As a result, the message being communicated is more vulnerable to being misunderstood due to a wrong interpretation of tone or word meaning. Moreover, according to Dr. Sobel-Lojeski of Stony Brook University and Professor Westwell of Flinders University, the virtual distance that is fundamental to computer-mediated communication can create a psychological and emotional sense of detachment, which can contribute to sentiments of societal isolation.

==Crime==
Cybersex trafficking and other cyber crimes involve computer-mediated communication. Cybercriminals can carry out the crimes in any location where they have a computer or tablet with a webcam or a smartphone with an internet connection. They also rely on social media networks, videoconferences, pornographic video sharing websites, dating pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites, and other platforms. They use online payment systems and cryptocurrencies to hide their identities. Millions of reports of these crimes are sent to authorities annually. New laws and police procedures are needed to combat crimes involving CMC.

<text>Tadpole is a 2002 American romantic comedy film directed by Gary Winick, written by Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller, and starring Sigourney Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth, Aaron Stanford, John Ritter, Robert Iler, and Kate Mara.

A low-budget production, &quot;Tadpole&quot; premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival where it won rave reviews and was awarded the Dramatic Directing Award for Winick. Miramax acquired the film for distribution and gave it a limited theatrical release on August 2, 2002.

==Plot==
Oscar Grubman is a precocious 15-year-old boy traveling home from school for Thanksgiving. He speaks fluent French, quotes Voltaire and finds girls of his own age to be too shallow and superficial, as well as too immature and inexperienced in life. When Miranda Spear, an attractive girl from school, shows interest in Oscar, he politely brushes her off. Oscar confides in his friend Charlie that he is in love with a mature woman and plans to win her heart during Thanksgiving break.

Oscar arrives at his family’s apartment, Columbia University history professor and author, Stanley Grubman and stepmother, the passionate cardiologist, Eve. That evening, the Grubmans hold a party where Stanley introduces him to a girl of his age, but Oscar rebuffs her as well while staring at the object of his affection: his stepmother.

Oscar tries to open up to her, but the unsuspecting Eve doesn&#x27;t pick up on any of his advances. Stanley tells him to walk the girl home, but he hails her a cab. Depressed from his failure with the older woman, Oscar goes to a bar with a fake ID and gets drunk. He bumps into Eve&#x27;s best friend, chiropractor Diane Lodder, who offers to take him to her own apartment seeing his current condition. Once there, Diane begins to massage him and they end up having sex. Oscar wakes the next morning and has an awkward encounter with Diane&#x27;s boyfriend, Phil.

Back at home, Oscar plans a surprise lunch for Eve, but first Stanley inquires about where Oscar spent the night. Oscar makes up a story about meeting Miranda Spear from school. He brings lunch to Eve at her lab, where he opens up to her once more, pondering the use of the heart as a symbol for affection. Together, they decide that the liver should be the new symbol for love.

Their conversation is interrupted by a phone call from Stanley, who mentions that Diane will be joining them for dinner. Worried that Diane will tell Eve about their , Oscar finds Diane at a tearoom with several of her friends. All act as though they know about the previous evening, and most of the women twice his age flirt with him. Oscar makes Diane promise to keep last night a secret from Stanley and especially Eve.

At dinner, Diane drinks and behaves coyly. She plays footsie with Oscar and flirts with him in French. After she excuses herself from the table, Oscar follows to confront her. She kisses him while not being totally out of Stanley&#x27;s view, after which Diane admits to Stanley and Eve that she and Oscar are lovers.

The next day, Diane explains to Eve that she found Oscar a charming young man. Eve condemns her for seducing a mere 15-year-old, but Diane says many women would have done the same, including perhaps Eve. Later that day, Eve and Oscar play a tense round of tennis, lobbing insults at each other, ending up with Oscar getting hit in the head with a ball. Oscar explains to Eve that he only did what he did with Diane because he was drunk, and she was wearing Eve&#x27;s scarf. Eve immediately understands that he is in love with her. They share a passionate kiss, but Eve eventually breaks away.

At the end of Thanksgiving break, Eve and Stanley take Oscar to the train. Eve asks Oscar how his liver feels, and he replies that it hurts, but is not broken. She also tells him how much she loves his father. On the train, Oscar meets up with Charlie, and runs into Miranda. Miranda quotes Voltaire, &quot;If we do not find something pleasant at least we will find something new,&quot; and looks longingly at Oscar. Charlie notices this, and Oscar tells Charlie that Miranda smells nice. Charlie asks about Eve, and Oscar states that his obsession with Eve was not as important as it seemed. Charlie doesn&#x27;t understand his friend, but Oscar smiles as the train rolls on.

== Cast ==
==Production==
The film was shot on digital video cameras in just two weeks on an estimated budget of $150,000.

== Reception ==
=== Release ===
The film premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, where it was acquired by Miramax for $5 million.

The film made $3,200,241 worldwide; from $2,891,288 in North America and $308,953 in other territories. The film opened with $80,682 in its opening weekend (7/19-21) and raised 34% ($273,373) in the second weekend.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of critics, based on 108 collected reviews, gave the film a positive review. The site’s consensus states, &quot;Presenting a sexual awakening with surprising candor, &quot;Tadpole&quot; is a spiky coming of age tale that benefits from a deeply felt performance by Aaron Stanford and a script that is unafraid to wade into morally choppy waters.&quot;

Though some critics cited the film&#x27;s modest filming methods as drawbacks, multiple reviews praised the performances. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Were it not for the charm of Mr. Stanford...Oscar might have emerged as an insufferably pretentious hothouse flower. But the actor (23 when the movie was made) flawlessly captures his character&#x27;s aching, doe-eyed sincerity and yearning goodness.&quot; Holden added &quot;At its most endearing, the film conveys the same intense identification with Oscar&#x27;s thoughts and mood swings that Mr. Salinger brought to his legendary character, and its adolescent-eyed view of Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side as a glowing, mysterious wonderland is deeply Salinger-esque.&quot;

Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; concurred, stating &quot;The best instinct of director Gary Winick (&quot;The Tic Code&quot;) and screenwriters Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller is to emphasize old-fashioned courtliness in this likable comedy – good manners that go a long way toward convincing viewers the movie&#x27;s got something fresh to say even while it&#x27;s set in familiar territory.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave a more mixed review where he voiced his discomfort with the film&#x27;s premise, writing &quot;Too much has happened in the arena of sexual politics since &#x27;&quot;The Graduate&quot;&#x27; and I kept thinking that since Oscar was 15 and his stepmother and her friend were about 40, this plot would have been unthinkable if the genders had been reversed.&quot; He also critiqued the film&#x27;s level of plausibility and its development of characters, but praised Bebe Neuwirth&#x27;s performance. Ebert concluded, &quot;A longer movie (this one is barely feature length at 77 minutes) might have made the relationships more nuanced and convincing.&quot;&quot;&quot;

<doc id="320502" wikidata="Q820116" url="?curid=320502" title="Panic (2000 film)">
<text>Panic is a 2000 American crime drama film written and directed by Henry Bromell and starring William H. Macy in the lead role, alongside Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, Miguel Sandoval, and Donald Sutherland. The film centers on Alex (Macy), a hitman who suffers a midlife crisis amidst the number of struggles he and his family face. Determined to quit contract killing, he seeks treatment from therapist Dr. John Parks (Ritter) and enters an affair with a younger woman, Sarah Cassidy (Campbell).

&quot;Panic&quot; premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, and was later given a limited release in theaters in December of that year. The film received universal acclaim from major film critics, who in particular praised the performances of the acting ensemble.

==Plot==
Alex lives a double life: he is married with a day job, and is a professional hitman. Trained by his father Michael from youth, Alex is dissatisfied with his work and wishes to leave the business behind. He goes into psychotherapy with Dr. Josh Parks, disclosing that he is a hit man, and that he is attracted to a young woman he met in the waiting room. She is Sarah, 23, who is attracted to him as well, but does not want to get involved with a married man.

In flashbacks we see that Alex gets his start as a killer in the family business, at his father&#x27;s prompting, from his killing of a squirrel as a young boy, to his first human victim as a teenager. Worried that Alex is informing on him, Michael gives Alex his next assignment: to kill Dr. Parks. Alex delays, while Dr. Parks, fearing for his own safety, contacts a police detective, Larson.

Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage and his malaise. Eventually, he has an affair with Sarah. His wife soon discovers the affair and leaves him, not before he discovers that his father had been grooming his son, Sammy, as a future assassin. Determined not to let Michael ruin Sammy, too, he drives up to Michael&#x27;s home and shoots him dead, only to be killed himself by Larson, who had been secretly following him.

==Cast==

==Reception==
===Box office===
Following a premiere at the January 2000 Sundance Film Festival, &quot;Panic&quot; was given a limited theatrical release (peak of 11 theatres) in the United States and Canada in December 2000, grossing $0.78million at the box office, against a budget of $1.0million.

===Critical response===
 Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four. Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half stars but praised the acting, calling it &quot;excellent.&quot; Lisa Nesselson of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Pic’s title implies frenzy and wild activity, but the film’s charm evolves from its measured, unhurried rhythms, and originality from the tone: quirky yet convincing, irreverent yet moral.&quot;

Sarah begins having recurring dreams about Louis as a water-drenched corpse coming home and strangling her. Frank and Sarah start getting paranoid when one of Louis&#x27;s drinking buddies, Clay, who also happens to be cop, starts coming around and asking questions. The couple finds Louis&#x27;s car on the street without the keys, realizing they were left in Louis&#x27;s pants pocket at the bottom of the lake. Frank goes to the lake and jumps in to retrieve the keys so they can dispose of the car. When Sarah sees wet footprints in front of the house and hears the soggy steps nearing her bedroom door, much like in her recurring nightmares, she shoots through the door with the shotgun (the same one Louis used and was eventually killed with) only to discover it was Frank at her door returning from the lake with the retrieved keys. The next morning, when the police arrive with Clay in tow, they find Frank shot to death and Sarah hanging from the ceiling, just as Louis had intended in the beginning. The police notice something odd at the murder-suicide crime scene: Sarah&#x27;s body is drenched in water.

===&quot;Bobo&quot;===
The Gatleys are the perfect family. The father, Ron, and his daughter, Jennifer, have a close bond. One day, Jennifer finds a small monkey wearing organ grinder attire in their tree, names it Bobo, and persuades her father to allow her to keep him until they can find his owner. Jennifer and Bobo begin forming a close bond while her bond with her father begins to weaken. Ron notices this and begins to grow suspicious of Bobo. The Gatleys&#x27; pet dog, Max, chases Bobo through the house before Bobo throws an object at Max&#x27;s head, injuring the dog. Ron becomes livid and demands the monkey be put outside. When Jennifer defies her father, and Ron&#x27;s wife, Carol, asks that he compromise, Ron agrees as long as Bobo gets a cage. When Ron attempts to put Bobo in the cage, Bobo bites his hand which leads to Ron demanding the monkey to be removed completely. He eventually gets Bobo in the cage and taunts the monkey, alongside Max who growls at the monkey, and promises to euthanize Bobo. The next morning, Ron discovers Max stabbed to death, the cage door open, and Bobo missing. Ron hides Max&#x27;s body in the garage. Ron asks his wife and daughter to leave the home immediately, which they do. Now left alone at home, Ron calls the police but they refer him to the local pound dispatcher. Ron bribes the pound dispatcher to get the monkey out of his house. After burying Max in the back yard, Ron goes inside the house to find the pound dispatcher stabbed to death as well. He hides the pound dispatcher&#x27;s body in the garage. When they return home and see Ron shooting at the monkey, both Carol and Jennifer now doubt Ron&#x27;s sanity. While the family sleeps, Ron sets up a bear trap only for Bobo to trick him into thinking he had been trapped. While Ron investigates the bear trap, Bobo kills Carol by cutting her throat in bed. Now off the deep end, Ron goes after Bobo with the shotgun in Jennifer&#x27;s room. As Bobo and Ron struggle in a fight, Ron loses the gun and Jennifer retrieves it. Ron pins Bobo to the ground and tells his daughter to give him the gun so he can end it. Jennifer shoots Ron instead. Back in the present time, Bob Carter tells the Doyles that the police believe Ron was responsible for the killings, and Jennifer shot him in self-defense, never saying another word after that since she became catatonic. As for Bobo, he simply disappeared.

===&quot;Come To Granny&quot;===
Dr. Lindsay, a troubled physician with psychic abilities, visits Dr. Corey, a therapist, in her office after hours to tell her of his visions in which he sees The Granny Killer killing his victims shortly before they happen. When he has these visions, he has debilitating fits that cause him to lose control. One vision caused him to fall in the shower and vomit. Another vision caused him to nearly drown his girlfriend while they swam in his family&#x27;s pool. The third vision caused him to nearly collide head-on with a truck while driving, but it also prompted him to call the police since the vision was of his girlfriend getting murdered by The Granny Killer. Hoping to get there in time, he races to his girlfriend&#x27;s house only to find her dismembered body parts strewn through the house. Sean reveals to Dr. Corey that she is The Granny Killer&#x27;s next victim based on his most recent vision. Sean begins to reach for inside his jacket. Dr. Corey, now believing that Sean is The Granny Killer himself, drives Sean down onto a receipt letter spike on her desk and runs out of the office, heading for the elevators. As she anxiously waits for the elevator to reach her floor, Sean begins slowly coming towards her, badly wounded by the receipt letter spike jutting out of his chest. As both he and the elevator reach their destinations, Sean pulls the receipt letter spike from his chest, pulls out a gun to hand to Dr. Corey, but loses consciousness, and both he and the gun fall to the floor. At the same time, the elevator doors open, revealing The Granny Killer standing inside with a meat cleaver. Dr. Corey screams as the meat cleaver swings towards her.

===&quot;Make Me an Offer&quot; (conclusion)===
The Doyles refuse to buy any of the houses Bob Carter offers them because of the horror stories involved with each one. Carter realizes he failed to meet the deadline when his cell phone rings and the voice on the other side tells him Carter&#x27;s wife and son are there on the other end of the phone. Carter&#x27;s son gets on the phone and begs his father to close a deal now. Driven insane, Carter stabs Mr. Doyle in the neck, and as Mr. Doyle collapses to the floor with blood spurting from his neck, Carter begins stabbing him in the back. A horrified Mrs. Doyle runs out of the house to see a neighbor mowing over a cat buried neck-deep into the lawn. As she gets in the car to drive off, Carter appears at the driver&#x27;s side window with bloody papers in his hand begging her to close the deal. As Mrs. Doyle drives off while screaming, Bobo the murderous monkey appears on her windshield, a woman shoots her husband in a driveway, an old woman smiles at her while a human leg sticks out of her trash can, and other murderous chaos occurs as Mrs. Doyle drives away from the hellish neighborhood.

<text>Quantum Jump were a 1970s British band, consisting of singer and keyboard player Rupert Hine, guitarist Mark Warner, bass player John G. Perry (then of Caravan), and drummer Trevor Morais (who had previously played in The Peddlers). The band is best remembered for its 1979 UK hit single &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;.

==Career==
Quantum Jump were formed in 1973 at Farmyard rehearsal studios by Trevor Morais and Jeffrey Levinson. The idea for the name came from a conversation Rupert Hine had with Anthony Stern, an ex-Cambridge University friend and filmmaker. &quot;He had told me about the relatively recent discovery at Cambridge of the manner in which an electron&#x27;s energy increases and decreases, not linearly as had been long assumed, but in a discrete step, known as a &quot;quantum&quot;. The term &quot;quantum jump&quot; (later to be commonly referred to as &quot;quantum leap&quot;) was coined by the Cambridge team. I preferred &quot;jump&quot;, as it had more of a &quot;soul / funk&quot; music connotation&quot;.

Quantum Jump&#x27;s sound was a hybrid of fusion, funk, and jazz rock. The first album was written and arranged in 1973–1974, and recorded (with equipment hired from AIR London) at Farmyard. Hine produced the sessions, with Steve Nye as sound engineer. The sessions were independently financed by Jeffrey Levinson (of Mountain Fjord) but, explained Hine, after some 18 months of managerial and contractual problems, the rights to the album were sold to The Electric Record Company in 1975. The label&#x27;s MD, Jeremy Thomas, believed that the song &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was a potential hit single if only it had something more &quot;interesting&quot; for the intro.

Hine picked up on his remark and sang the longest word in the world (listed in &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot;) &quot;a capella&quot;, replacing the original intro to the song altogether. The word in question, taken from the language of the Maori, New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous people, was the name of the hill  in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, New Zealand. On the record, the word (made to sound as if it were Native American, in keeping with the Lone Ranger and Tonto theme) is chanted as follows:

Taumata-whaka-tangi-hanga-kuayuwo
tamate-aturi-pukaku-piki-maunga
horonuku-pokaiawhen-uaka-tana-tahu
mataku-atanganu-akawa-miki-tora

&quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; was first released in 1976. After it was chosen as Tony Blackburn&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 &quot;Record of the Week&quot; (the nationwide morning radio show with the highest ratings in the UK at the time), it was banned when some fragments of lyrics were deemed to contain references to drugs and homosexuality. The BBC stopped playing the record, and it failed to chart. Disillusionment with the length of time it had taken to get the original record deal, and the lack of any really cohesive management, led to guitarist Mark Warner&#x27;s decision to leave and join Cat Stevens&#x27; live band.

Quantum Jump soldiered on for a second album, recorded in late 1976 as a trio with the help of various musician friends, most notably Caravan multi-instrumentalist Geoffrey Richardson. &quot;Barracuda&quot; was released in April 1977, coinciding with the band going out on the road for a couple of UK tours with Roye Albrighton (of Nektar) on guitar. The album had been expensive to record, and when it did not sell well enough, Quantum Jump disbanded at the end of 1977.

The band would, however, make an unexpected return two years later when a re-release of &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; single became an unexpected hit. The song had been widely played by Kenny Everett on both his radio and TV shows. Re-released in 1979, it eventually reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart and number 67 in Australia. The band (including Mark Warner) reconvened for an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. A third Quantum Jump album was released to coincide with this unexpected &quot;smash&quot; single. Titled &quot;Mixing&quot;, it was essentially a collection of the best tracks from the first two albums, albeit heavily reworked and remixed.

Hine went on to become the producer of more than 100 albums for artists as varied as Tina Turner, Bob Geldof, Chris de Burgh, the Thompson Twins, Stevie Nicks, Rush, the Waterboys, Suzanne Vega, Duncan Sheik, the Fixx and Howard Jones. He would also appear to form another band in the mid-1980s, called Thinkman, but this was simply another name for his solo recordings. In addition, there is the Soundtrack album &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; on A&amp;M Records, featuring Rupert Hine, Cy Curnin (the Fixx), Martin Ansell, Terri Nunn, Thinkman, and E. G. Daily. The production is centered on Rupert Hine, and this is the first appearance of Thinkman.

<doc id="320509" wikidata="Q212933" url="?curid=320509" title="Pine nut">
<text>Pine nuts, also called piñón (), pinoli (), or pignoli, are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus &quot;Pinus&quot;). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, only 29 species provide edible nuts, while 20 are traded locally or internationally owing to their seed size being large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible but are too small to be of notable value as human food. The biggest producers of pine nuts are China, Russia, North Korea, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

As pines are gymnosperms, not angiosperms (flowering plants), pine nuts are not &quot;true nuts&quot;; they are not botanical fruits, the seed not being enclosed in an ovary which develops into the fruit, but simply bare seeds—&quot;gymnosperm&quot; meaning literally &quot;naked seed&quot; (from and ). The similarity of pine nuts to some angiosperm fruits is an example of convergent evolution.

==Species and geographic spread==

In Asia, two species, in particular, are widely harvested: Korean pine (&quot;Pinus koraiensis&quot;) in northeast Asia (the most important species in international trade) and chilgoza pine (&quot;P. gerardiana&quot;) in the western Himalaya. Four other species, Siberian pine (&quot;P. sibirica&quot;), Siberian dwarf pine (&quot;P. pumila&quot;), Chinese white pine (&quot;P. armandii&quot;) and lacebark pine (&quot;P. bungeana&quot;), are also used to a lesser extent. Russia is the largest producer of &quot;P. sibirica&quot; nuts in the world, followed by either Mongolia or Afghanistan. They each produce over annually, most of it exported to China.

Pine nuts produced in Europe mostly come from the stone pine (&quot;P. pinea&quot;), which has been cultivated for its nuts for over 5,000 years. Pine nuts have been harvested from wild trees for far longer. The Swiss pine (&quot;P. cembra&quot;) is also used, to a very small extent.

In North America, the main species are three of the pinyon pines: Colorado pinyon (&quot;P. edulis&quot;), single-leaf pinyon (&quot;P. monophylla&quot;), and Mexican pinyon (&quot;P. cembroides&quot;). The other eight pinyon species are used to a small extent, as is gray pine (&quot;P. sabineana&quot;), Coulter pine (&quot;P. coulteri&quot;), Torrey pine (&quot;P. torreyana&quot;), sugar pine (&quot;P. lambertiana&quot;) and Parry pinyon (&quot;P. quadrifolia&quot;). Here, the nuts themselves are known by the Spanish name for the pinyon pine, &quot;piñón&quot; (plural: &quot;piñones&quot;).

In the United States, pine nuts are mainly harvested by Native American and Hispano communities, particularly in the Western United States and Southwestern United States, by the Shoshone, Paiute, Navajo, Pueblo, Hopi, Washoe, and Hispanos of New Mexico. Certain treaties negotiated by tribes and laws in Nevada guarantee Native Americans&#x27; right to harvest pine nuts, and the state of New Mexico protects the use of the word &quot;piñon&quot; for use with pine nuts from certain species of indigenous New Mexican pines.

**&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot; – California foothill pine

==Pollination and seed development==
Pine nuts will not reach full maturity unless the environmental conditions are favorable for the tree and the cone. The time to maturity varies depending on the species.

For some American species, development begins in early spring with pollination. A tiny cone, about the size of a small marble, will form from mid-spring through the end of summer; this immature cone will temporarily cease growing and remain dormant until the following spring, then grow again until it reaches maturity near the end of its second summer. The mature piñon pine cone is ready to harvest ten days before the green cone begins to open. A cone is harvested by placing it in a burlap bag and exposing it to a heat source such as the sun to begin drying. It takes about 20 days until the cone fully opens. Once it is fully open and dry, the seed can be easily extracted in various ways. The most common and practical extraction method used is the repeated striking of the burlap bag containing the cone(s) against a rough surface to cause the cone(s) to shatter, leaving just the job of separating by hand the seed from the residue within the bag.

Another option for harvesting is to wait until the cone opens on the tree (as it naturally will) and harvest the cone from the piñon pine, followed by the extracting process mentioned above. Fallen seeds can also be gathered beneath the trees.

==Ecology and status==
Because pine nuts are an important food source for many animals, overharvesting of pine nuts threatens local ecosystems, an effect occurring during the early 21st century with increased culinary uses for pine nuts. In the United States, millions of hectares of productive pinyon pine woods have been destroyed due to conversion of lands, and in China and Russia, destructive harvesting techniques (such as breaking off whole branches to harvest the cones) and removal of trees for timber have led to losses in production capacity.

===Elevation and pinecone production===
Some growers claim that the elevation of the pinyon pine is an important determinant of the quantity of pine cone production and, therefore, will largely determine the number of pine nuts the tree will yield. The US Department of Agriculture notes that variation in cone production between trees growing on identical sites is often observed.

American pinyon pine cone production is most commonly found at an elevation between , and ideally at . This is due to higher temperatures at elevations lower than during the spring, which dry up humidity and moisture content (particularly snow packs) that provide for the tree throughout the spring and summer, causing little nourishment for pine cone maturity.

Although several other environmental factors determine the conditions of the ecosystem (such as clouds and rain), the trees tend to abort cones without sufficient water. High humidity encourages cone development. There are certain topographical areas found in lower elevations, such as shaded canyons, where the humidity remains constant throughout the spring and summer, allowing pine cones to fully mature and produce seed.

At elevations above , the temperature substantially drops, drastically affecting the state of the dormant cone. During the winter, frequent dramatic changes in temperature, drying, and gusty winds make the cones susceptible to freeze-drying that permanently damages them; in this case, growth is stunted, and the seeds deteriorate.

==Physical characteristics==

When first extracted from the pine cone, they are covered with a hard shell (seed coat), thin in some species and thick in others. The nutrition is stored in the embryo (sporophyte) in the center. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense, pine nuts are seeds; being a gymnosperm, they lack a carpel (fruit) outside.

The shell must be removed before the pine nut can be eaten. Unshelled pine nuts have a long shelf life if kept dry and refrigerated (); shelled nuts (and unshelled nuts in warm conditions) deteriorate rapidly, becoming rancid within a few weeks or even days in warm, humid conditions. Pine nuts are commercially available in the shelled form, but due to poor storage, they can have poor flavor and may already be rancid at the time of purchase. Consequently, pine nuts are often frozen to preserve their flavor.

European pine nuts may be distinguished from Asian ones by their greater length than girth; Asian pine nuts are stubbier, shaped somewhat like long kernels of corn. The American piñon nuts are known for their large size and ease of shelling. In the United States, &quot;Pinus edulis&quot;, the hard shell of New Mexico and Colorado, became a sought-after species due to the trading post system and the Navajo people who used the nuts as a means of commerce. The Italian pine nut (&quot;P. pinea&quot;) was brought to the United States by immigrants and became a favored treat along the East Coast in the early 1930s, when bumper crops of American pine nuts were readily available at low prices.

==Nutrition==
When dried for eating, pine nuts are 2% water, 13% carbohydrates, 14% protein, and 68% fat (table). In a reference serving, dried pine nuts supply of food energy and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous micronutrients, particularly manganese (419% DV), phosphorus (82% DV), magnesium (71% DV), zinc (67% DV), copper (65% DV), vitamin E (62% DV), vitamin K (51% DV), and the B vitamins, thiamin and niacin (29–35% DV), among others (table).

==Culinary uses==
Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are frequently added to meat, fish, salads, and vegetable dishes or baked into bread.

In Italian, they are called &quot;pinoli&quot; (in the US, they are often called &quot;pignoli&quot;, but in Italy, &quot;pignolo&quot; is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy, overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person) and are an essential component of Italian pesto sauce; the upsurge in the popularity of this sauce since the 1990s has increased the visibility of the nut in America, primarily on the West Coast. &quot;Torta della nonna&quot; (literally &quot;granny&#x27;s cake&quot;) is a generic Italian dish name that in most families indicates an old family recipe for any cake but often is used for a tart or a pie filled with custard, topped with pine nuts and optionally dusted with icing sugar. Pignoli cookies, an Italian American specialty confection (in Italy, these would be called &quot;biscotti ai pinoli&quot;), are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts.

In Catalonia, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg, and lightly cooked, and those are called &quot;panellets&quot;. Pine nuts are also featured in the &quot;salade landaise&quot; of southwestern France. Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is promoted for its large size, sweet flavor, and ease of peeling.
Pine nuts are also widely used in Levantine cuisine, reflected in a diverse range of dishes such as &quot;kibbeh&quot;, &quot;sambusak&quot;, &quot;fatayer&quot;, and &quot;Maqluba&quot;, desserts such as baklava, meghli, and many others.

Throughout Europe, the Levant, and West Asia, the pine nuts used are traditionally from &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; (stone pine). They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations.

Pine nut oil is added to foods for flavor. 
===Taste disturbances===
Some raw pine nuts can cause pine mouth syndrome, a taste disturbance lasting from a few days to a few weeks after consumption. A bitter, metallic, unpleasant taste is reported. There are no known lasting effects, with the United States Food and Drug Administration reporting that there are &quot;no apparent adverse clinical side effects&quot;. Raw nuts from &quot;Pinus armandii&quot;, mainly in China, may be the cause of the problem. Metallic taste disturbance is typically reported 1–3 days after ingestion, being worse on day two and typically lasting up to two weeks. Cases are self-limited and resolve without treatment.

===Food fraud===
In the United States, from 2008 to 2012, some people reported a bitter metallic taste (&quot;pine mouth&quot;) that sometimes lasted for weeks after they ate pine nuts. After an international investigation, the FDA found that some manufacturers substituted a non-food species of pine nuts in place of more expensive edible pine nut species as a form of food fraud.

==Other uses==
Some Native American tribes use the hard outer shell of the pine nut as a bead for decorative purposes in traditional regalia and jewelry. In the Great Basin area of the US, collecting pine nuts is a protected right through state law and treaty.

In northern California, pine nuts are collected from the grey pine or bull pine. Tribes burn designs into the hard shell, reflecting the same design they use in baskets; however, they are often left blank or burned to blacken. These are more often used in women&#x27;s regalia and jewelry.

<text>Frank Crumit (September 26, 1889 – September 7, 1943) was an American singer, composer, radio entertainer and vaudeville star. He shared his radio programs with his wife, Julia Sanderson, and the two were sometimes called &quot;the ideal couple of the air.&quot;

==Biography==
Crumit was born in Jackson, Ohio, the son of Frank and Mary (née Poore) Crumit. He made his first stage appearance at the age of five in a minstrel show.

Attending local schools, Crumit graduated from high school in 1907. After briefly attending an Indiana military academy, he entered Ohio University and later Ohio State University. His primary purpose for entering Ohio University was to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, Dr. C. K. Crumit, who had been a medical doctor. He instead graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in electrical engineering. This career did not last long, as his passion seemed to be music and the old ballads of the 19th century; his love of music and theater dated back to his early years in the Methodist Church choir and led him to pursue a musical career. He studied voice in Cincinnati and then tried out unsuccessfully for opera in New York City.

By 1913, in his early 20s, he was performing on the vaudeville stage, first with a trio and then a year later on his own, playing ukulele; he was referred to as &quot;the one-man glee club&quot; in New York City&#x27;s night spots. He appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;Betty Be Good&quot; in 1918, where he was the first to play the ukulele on Broadway.

He was a success there and went on to &quot;Greenwich Village Follies of 1920&quot;, which featured his song, &quot;Sweet Lady,&quot; written with David B. Zoob.
Crumit began making records for American Columbia in 1919, during the time of the acoustic or &quot;horn&quot; method of recording, an entirely mechanical process which preceded the development of microphones and amplifiers in the mid-1920s. Crumit also occasionally added vocals and banjo to recordings by the Paul Biese Trio on the American Columbia label. By the end of 1923, Crumit was recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company.

He met Julia Sanderson, then a musical comedy star, in 1922. Sanderson, 38, was sued for divorce in September of that year by her then-husband, U.S. Navy Lieut. Bradford Barnette, with Crumit, 33, named as co-respondent. Crumit was married to a Connecticut woman at the time.

Crumit and Sanderson were married in 1928, and retired briefly to a country home near Springfield, Mass., but two years later they began working as a radio team, singing duets and engaging in comedy dialogues. The couple starred in &quot;Blackstone Plantation&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS (1929–1930) and on NBC (1930–1934). They performed as the &quot;Singing Sweethearts of the Air.&quot;

In 1930, they continued with a popular quiz show, &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot;, which ran 13 years; because all radio programs of their era were broadcast &quot;live,&quot; Crumit and Sanderson drove from Massachusetts to New York City, a four-hour trip, twice a week to do their radio show. Their final broadcast was aired the day before Crumit&#x27;s death from a heart attack in New York City on September 7, 1943.

==Hit songs==
His biggest hits were made during the 1920s and early 1930s; they included popular phonograph records of &quot;Frankie and Johnnie&quot;, &quot;Abdul Abulbul Amir&quot;, &quot;A Gay Caballero&quot; (he even recorded a sequel, &quot;The Return of a Gay Caballero&quot;), &quot;The Prune Song&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s No-one With Endurance Like The Man Who Sells Insurance&quot;, &quot;Down In De Canebrake&quot;, &quot;I Wish That I&#x27;d Been Born in Borneo&quot;, &quot;What Kind of a Noise Annoys an Oyster?&quot;, and &quot;I Learned About Women From Her&quot;. Crumit is credited with composing at least 50 songs in his career, including the Ohio State University fight song, &quot;Buckeye Battle Cry&quot; in 1919 for a song contest. Prior to this he wrote at least two songs for Ohio University, “Round on the Ends” and “OH + IO.” He composed and published &quot;Hills of Ohio&quot; in 1941. His song &quot;Donald the Dub&quot; was used as the theme music to the BBC radio adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Oldest Member&quot;.

His back-to-back recording (that is, one song on each side) of &quot;The Gay Caballero&quot; and &quot;Abdul Abulbul Amir&quot; (Decca W-4200) sold more than four million records.

His 1929 song &quot;A Tale of the Ticker&quot;, came out just a few months before the Wall Street crash in October. This song&#x27;s lyrics shed light on the problems involved in stock market, correctly foreshadowing the devastating event that would happen just weeks following. The song was featured in the BBC documentary, &quot;The Great Crash 1929&quot;.

Like so many of the performers during the era, Crumit was a fan of the instruments created by the C.F. Martin &amp; Company and used their tiple, to the point it had to be returned for a new top.

<text>The Five Find-Outers and Dog, also known as The Five Find-Outers, is a series of children&#x27;s mystery books written by Enid Blyton. The first was published in 1943 and the last in 1961. Set in the fictitious village of Peterswood based on Bourne End, close to Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the children Fatty (Frederick Trotteville), who is the leader of the team, Larry (Laurence Daykin), Pip (Philip Hilton), Daisy (Margaret Daykin), Bets (Elizabeth Hilton) and Buster, Fatty&#x27;s dog, encounter a mystery almost every school holiday, always solving the puzzle before Mr Goon, the unpleasant village policeman, much to his annoyance.

== Characters ==
=== The Five Find-Outers and Dog ===
* Frederick Algernon &quot;Fatty&quot; Trotteville – the leader of the Five Find-Outers from the third book on, when he justifies his leadership by demonstrating how to use invisible ink and how to escape from a locked room. He is given the nickname Fatty by the other children because of his initials, Frederick Algernon Trotteville, F.A.T. and his stout build. Being an only child, he receives generous amounts of pocket money from his parents and wealthy relatives, but Fatty is always willing to share his money with the group, often buying rounds of cakes, drinks and ice-creams. Fatty also uses his pocket money to finance his interest in disguises and stores a large collection of clothes, wigs, greasepaint, cheek-pads, false teeth and other items in his shed at the bottom of the garden. Although boastful by nature, he learns to be more modest as his bragging causes the other children to become irritated. Fatty is a skilled orator and poet, and able to create poetry ad-lib. He is apparently top of his form at his boarding school and his ambition when he grows up is to become a detective. Fatty develops an interest in ventriloquism as the series progresses. Bets in particular adores Fatty and is very loyal to him. He is 12 at the start of the series and turns 13 just after Christmas.
* Laurence &quot;Larry&quot; Daykin – the eldest of the five and the original leader of the Five Find-Outers, passing the role to Fatty at the beginning of the third book. Larry is sometimes annoyed by Fatty&#x27;s boasting. He is Daisy&#x27;s older brother. He is the first character to be introduced in the series, but is developed considerably less than the other main characters as the series continues. As the oldest of the Five Find Outers, in the first story he is 13 years old. His birthday falls between Christmas and Easter.
* Margaret &quot;Daisy&quot; Daykin – Larry&#x27;s younger sister. Creating the Five Find-Outers was Daisy&#x27;s idea. She is particularly good at thinking of plans and ideas. She is younger than Larry by a year and the same age as Pip and Fatty, who are 12 as the series begins.
* Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Hilton – The same age as Daisy and a few years older than Bets, his younger sister whom he frequently teases. In contrast to Fatty&#x27;s rather relaxed parents, Mr and Mrs Hilton are quite strict and often take a dim view of Pip and Bets&#x27;s sleuthing activities, wishing that Pip especially would direct the same amount of energy into his schoolwork. In &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden House&quot; the Hiltons forbid Pip and Bets from getting involved in mysteries, but the children still find themselves in one. He is 12 at the beginning of the series, nearly 4 years older than his little sister. In later stories we learn that Pip&#x27;s birthday falls early in January, while Bets&#x27; falls during the Autumn term.
* Elizabeth &quot;Bets&quot; Hilton – Pip&#x27;s younger sister adores and hero-worships Fatty and he is very fond of her in return. Though the youngest, the kind-hearted Bets proves herself to be a worthy member. She is keenly observant, providing crucial ideas that help Fatty in solving some of the baffling mysteries - as in the &#x27;Mystery of the Pantomime Cat&#x27; when she provides the breakthrough idea, to which Fatty exclaims: &quot;Bets! Good, clever, brainy old Bets. She&#x27;s got it! She&#x27;s solved it! Bets, you deserve to be head of the Find-Outers! Oh my word, Bets, why, why, why didn&#x27;t I think of it before?&quot;. She also thought of the name &#x27;Five Find-Outers and Dog&#x27;. She is by far the youngest of the five, beginning the series at just 8 years of age, but is then the first to have a birthday- in the Autumn term between the 2nd and 3rd books of the series.
* Buster – Fatty&#x27;s jet-black Scottish Terrier. He thinks the world of Fatty and his favourite pastime is to nip at Mr Goon&#x27;s ankles. His favourite food is biscuits, spread with potted meat. Originally Larry, Pip, and Daisy only let Fatty join the detective club because of Buster.

===Police force===
* Theophilus Goon – The village policeman and Ern&#x27;s uncle, who is outwitted by the five children in every single story. Mr Goon would dearly love promotion, but considers the children to be hindering him rather than helping. To chase them away he often tells them to &quot;Clear Orf&quot; (clear off). Consequently, the children have given him the nickname &quot;Clear-Orf&quot;. Whenever he is upset or frustrated, Mr Goon constantly yells, &quot;Gah!&quot; causing much amusement among the children. In the second book, The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat, and for a long time after that, the children are known to arrange false clues for Mr Goon to mislead him so that they can solve the mystery first without having to put up with him interfering their investigations.
* Inspector Jenks – Also known as Chief Inspector and Superintendent – the head of the local police department. Because the Five are resented by Mr Goon, the children always telephone or meet the Inspector when they have solved a mystery. Over the course of the books he becomes a great friend of the children. Jenks is based on a real character from Blyton&#x27;s home town who was promoted through the ranks of the police just as was his fictional counterpart. He becomes acquainted with the Five Find-Outers quite by chance in the first book of the series, &quot;The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage&quot;, while fishing. He admires the children, especially Fatty, much to the dismay of Mr. Goon, and clearly hints that he would like Fatty to become a policeman when he is grown up. He is also very fond of Bets who in turn looks forward to meeting him.
* P.C. Pippin – During The Mystery of the Pantomime Cat, P.C. Pippin takes over for a short time while Goon goes on a holiday and secretly helps the children to solve the mystery. Much to the delight of the children, P.C. Pippin is a nice man and dislikes Mr Goon extremely, who in turn hates him.
* P.C. Kenton – During the mystery of the Strange Bundle, P.C. Kenton is mentioned a few times and helps Mr.Goon to find an imaginary pig, dog and a man who wanted his auntie.
* P.C. Tonks – Appears at the beginning of &quot;The Mystery of the Invisible Thief&quot; while Goon is on a refresher course. He clearly states to Fatty that nothing could possibly take place in a quiet town like Peterswood.
* P.C. Johns – Appears in &quot;The Mystery of Tally Ho Cottage&quot; where he and Goon catch Fatty spying on Tally Ho Cottage in the middle of the night while also watching the house themselves. They are found in the morning by Ern locked in the boiler room.

===Minor characters===
* Ernest &quot;Ern&quot; Goon – Mr Goon&#x27;s nephew. Ern is introduced in the book &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden House.&quot; Ern is a great lover of poetry, or &quot;portry&quot; as he calls it, though he never finished any poem (or &#x27;pome&#x27; as he calls it) but Fatty can always finish it for him. That is one of the reasons that he is a great admirer of Fatty. Ern might be considered to be an unofficial seventh member of the group, although class distinctions are maintained, e.g. Ern is not permitted to eat dinner with the children but instead eats in the kitchen with the Cook. He is also seen in &quot;The Mystery of the Vanished Prince&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of Tally-Ho Cottage&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of the Strange Messages&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Banshee Towers&quot;.
* Miss Trimble – Lady Candling&#x27;s companion. The children call her Miss Tremble, because she is scared of everything. Her glasses often fall off and Bets loves to count how often this happens, much to Miss Trimble&#x27;s annoyance. First appearing in &quot;The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat&quot;, she reappears in &quot;The Mystery of the Spiteful Letters&quot;, when the children question her about the regular passengers on the 10:15 Monday bus to Sheepsale. In &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden House&quot;, the children (save for Fatty) see her at the railway station but that is the last time she is mentioned.
* Miss Harmer – The person who takes care of the cats belonging to Lady Candling in &quot;The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat&quot;. She is very upset after the most valuable cat Dark Queen is stolen twice, both times she was away for the day. When the children are smelling the cat cage she asks them to leave because she feels unsafe about the cats since the second time Dark Queen is stolen. When the children need her key to the cage they play a trick on her so she leaves her coat out of sight and Pip takes the key out of her coat pocket.
* Gladys – Pip and Bets&#x27; maid in &quot;The Mystery of the Spiteful Letters&quot;. When she receives a spiteful, anonymous letter, she flees the house to live with her aunt. When the children track her down, she admits that she used to be a thief but is trying to forget her old life. At the end of the book, Mrs Hilton announces that Gladys is coming back. She is mentioned a few times in &quot;The Mystery of the Missing Necklace&quot;. It is unknown what happened to her, as by the beginning of &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden House&quot;, the Hiltons have a new maid, Lorna.
* Mr and Mrs Hilton – The parents of Pip and Bets, they are very strict and particular. In &quot;The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage&quot;, Mr Goon gets the Find-Outers into trouble by complaining to Mrs Hilton. Mrs Hilton is especially described as being &quot;very strict about nice manners&quot;. He again complains to the Hiltons when the Find Outers send him a rude message written in secret ink in &quot;The Mystery of the Secret Room&quot;. Goon persuades the Hiltons not to tell the Find Outers anything about the anonymous letters in &quot;The Mystery of the Spiteful Letters&quot;. In &quot;The Mystery of the Hidden House&quot;, Mr and Mrs Hilton forbid Pip and Bets to get mixed up in any mysteries, due to a talk with Mr. Goon. However, despite their shortcomings, the Find Outers look up to and admire the Hiltons.
* Sid and Perce Goon – (short for Sidney and Percy) Ern&#x27;s younger twin brothers. They appeared in &quot;The Mystery of the Vanished Prince&quot; when they went camping with Ern. Sid has an obsession for eating toffee but he soon switches to chewing gum later in the series (according to Ern). Ern also refers to them later about a modelling clay incident (when Sid mistakenly chews Perce&#x27;s modelling clay as he thought it was chewing gum).
* Mrs Moon – Cook at the Hiltons during &quot;The Mystery of the Spiteful Letters&quot;.
* Hilary – God-daughter of Inspector Jenks, her home (Norton House) is burgled during &quot;The Mystery of the Invisible Thief&quot;.
* Luke – The gardener&#x27;s help next door to Pip and Bets in &quot;The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat&quot;. Luke develops a close bond with the children, which is strained when he is the prime suspect both times the cat goes missing. It is revealed at the end of the book that Luke was set up to hide the real culprit. It is hinted that his friendship with the children will continue, although he has never appeared or even been mentioned since.
* Mrs. Trotteville – She is Fatty&#x27;s mother and Fatty simply adores her. She is very lenient with him. Unlike the Hiltons she does not take Mr. Goon seriously and even considers him a nuisance. It is made out in the books that she enjoys going out with her husband for bridge parties. Though she does not like the children falling into adventure as she considers it dangerous, she does not interfere much and gives Fatty a lot of freedom and trust.
* The Postman – Appeared in several stories. The five always get some help from him.
* Liz and Glad – (Elizabeth Woosh and Gladys Woosh.) Ern Goon&#x27;s cousins who appear in The Mystery Of Tally-Ho Cottage. They helped Ern spy on the Larkins.
* Bingo – (Ern&#x27;s dog). Ern Goon&#x27;s new dog Bingo makes an appearance in the last book, &quot;The Mystery of the Banshee Towers&quot;. Bingo is described as having a huge tail that &quot;waves instead of wag&quot; but small legs to match it. Like Fatty and Buster, Ern and Bingo simply adore each other a lot.

== Timeline ==
At the beginning of the series Larry is 13; Fatty, Pip, and Daisy are 12; while Bets is 8. Bets goes to day school, whereas all the others go to boarding school, which Bets really does not like because the others are friends at school and she only sees them at the holidays. The series takes place in successive school holidays, beginning with the Easter holidays and cycling through the summer and Christmas holidays. During each holiday the children solve a mystery – until &quot;The Mystery of the Invisible Thief&quot; (summer holidays), after which there is a break until the next summer holidays in which they solve &quot;The Mystery of the Vanished Prince&quot;.

<doc id="320520" wikidata="Q2122370" url="?curid=320520" title="Reformed Baptists">
<text>Reformed Baptists, also historically called Particular Baptists, or even Calvinistic Baptists, are Baptists that hold to a Calvinist soteriology (salvation belief). Depending on the denomination, Calvinistic Baptists adhere to varying degrees of Reformed theology, ranging from simply embracing the Five Points of Calvinism, to accepting a modified form of federalism; all Calvinistic Baptists reject the classical Reformed teaching on infant baptism. While the Reformed Baptist confessions affirm views of the nature of baptism similar to those of the classical Reformed, they reject infants as the proper subjects of baptism. The first Calvinistic Baptist church was formed in the 1630s. The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith is a significant summary of the beliefs of Reformed Baptists. The name &quot;Reformed Baptist&quot; dates from the latter part of the 20th century to denote Baptists who retained Baptist ecclesiology, and reaffirmed Reformed biblical theology, such as Covenant theology.

==Reformed Baptist traditions==
===Particular Baptists===
Particular Baptists are a group that broke away from the Church of England in the 17th century. They adhere to a higher degree of Reformed theology than other Calvinistic Baptist groups and usually subscribe to the London Confession of 1689. Significant figures include John Bunyan, John Gill, and Charles Spurgeon. In the last century, the group became more popular as more Baptists identified with Puritan teachings.

===Strict Baptists===

Groups calling themselves Strict Baptists are often differentiated from other denominations calling themselves &quot;Reformed Baptists&quot;, sharing the same Calvinist doctrine, but differing on ecclesiastical polity; &quot;Strict Baptists&quot; generally prefer a congregationalist polity.

The group of Strict Baptists called Strict and Particular Baptists are Baptists who believe in a Calvinist interpretation of Christian salvation. The Particular Baptists arose in England in the 17th century, led by a radical travelling minister named William Gadsby, and took their name from the doctrine of particular redemption, while the term &quot;strict&quot; refers to the practice of closed communion. Their religious beliefs continue in the Gospel Standard Strict Baptist denomination.

===Primitive Baptists===

Primitive Baptists adhere to a Reformed soteriology. Primitive Baptists emphasize the teaching that &quot;God alone is the author of salvation and therefore any effort by human beings to make salvation happen or compel others to conversion is simply a form of &#x27;works righteousness&#x27; that implies that sinners can affect their own salvation.&quot; As such, they have rejected the concept of missions.

===Regular Baptists===

Regular Baptists adhere to a Reformed soteriology. Those who are Old Regular Baptists largely hold to the tenets of Calvinism, &quot;but maintain that God never predestined anyone to hell and that only those who do not heed the Word of God will be lost.&quot;

===United Baptists===
Certain denominations of United Baptists teach a Reformed soteriology.

===Sovereign Grace Baptists===
Sovereign Grace Baptists in the broadest sense are any &quot;Calvinistic&quot; Baptists that accept God&#x27;s sovereign grace in salvation and predestination. In the narrower sense, certain churches and groups have preferred &quot;Sovereign Grace&quot; in their name, rather than using the terms &quot;Calvinism&quot;, &quot;Calvinist&quot;, or &quot;Reformed Baptist&quot;. This includes some who prefer the 1644 Baptist Confession of Faith to the 1689 Confession, and who are critical of covenant theology.

All of these groups generally agree with the Five Points of Calvinism – Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the Saints. Groups calling themselves &quot;Sovereign Grace Baptists&quot; have been particularly influenced by the writings of John Gill in the 18th century. Among American Baptists who have revived such Calvinist ideas were Rolfe P. Barnard and Henry T. Mahan, who organised the first &quot;Sovereign Grace Bible Conference&quot; in Ashland, Kentucky, in 1954, though groups designated as &quot;Sovereign Grace&quot; are not necessarily connected to them.

Calvinistic Baptist groups presently using the term &quot;Sovereign Grace&quot; include the Sovereign Grace Baptist Association, the Sovereign Grace Fellowship of Canada, and some among the growing Calvinist strand of Independent Baptists, including several hundred Landmark Independent Baptist churches.

==By region==
=== United Kingdom ===

Reformed Baptist churches in the UK go back to the 1630s. Notable early pastors include the author John Bunyan (1628–88), Benjamin Keach (1640–1704), the theologian John Gill (1697–1771), John Brine (1703–64), Andrew Fuller, and the missionary William Carey (1761–1834). Charles Spurgeon (1834–92), pastor to the New Park Street Chapel (later the Metropolitan Tabernacle) in London, has been called &quot;by far the most famous and influential preacher the Baptists had.&quot; The Metropolitan Tabernacle itself has been particularly influential in the Reformed Baptist movement in the UK. Benjamin Keach, John Gill, John Rippon (1751–1836), Charles Spurgeon, and Peter Masters (mentioned below) have all pastored this same congregation. Their characteristic traits may be the founder (Keach, signer of the 1689), theologian (Gill), hymnist (Rippon), preacher (Spurgeon), and restorer (Masters).

The 1950s saw a renewed interest in Reformed theology among Baptists in the UK.

Peter Masters, pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London, created the London Reformed Baptist Seminary in 1975.

===United States===
Baptist churches in the United States continued to operate under the confessional statement, the 1689 London Baptist, but they renamed it according to the local associations in which it was adopted, first the Philadelphia Confession (1742, which includes two new chapters), then the Charleston Confession (1761, adopted from the London without changes). When the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary was founded, its governing confession, the abstract of principles, was summarized form of the 1689 London Baptist Confession, and its founding president, James P. Boyce wrote his &quot;Abstract of Systematic Theology&quot; from an evident Calvinist position. The first major shift at the seminary away from Calvinism came at the leadership of E. Y. Mullins, president from 1899 to 1928. Many of the developments in the U.K. mentioned above during the 1950s and following also made an impact on Baptists in America, seen especially in the Founders Movement (which was connected to the so-called &quot;Conservative Resurgence&quot; in the SBC) and in the works of men such as Walter Chantry, Roger Nicole, and Ernest Reisinger.

In March 2009, noting the resurgence of Calvinism in the United States, &quot;Time&quot; listed several Baptists among current Calvinist leaders. Albert Mohler, president of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, is a strong advocate of Calvinism, although his stand has received opposition from inside the Southern Baptist Convention. John Piper, who was pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis for 33 years, is one of several Baptists who have written in support of Calvinism.

While the Southern Baptist Convention remains split on Calvinism, there are a number of explicitly Reformed Baptist groups in the United States, including the Confessional Baptist Association, the Continental Baptist Churches, the Sovereign Grace Baptist Association of Churches, and other Sovereign Grace Baptists. Such groups have had some theological influence from other Reformed denominations, such as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. An example of this is the 1995 adaptation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Trinity Hymnal which was published for Reformed Baptist churches in America as the Trinity Hymnal (Baptist Edition).

By 2000, Reformed Baptist groups in the United States totaled about 16,000 people in 400 congregations.

Several Reformed Baptist Seminaries currently operate in the US; International Reformed Baptist Seminary (IRBS), Covenant Baptist Theological Seminary, Grace Bible Theological Seminary, &amp; Reformed Baptist Seminary are four that each subscribe to the 1689 London Baptist Confession in some form.

====Sovereign Grace Baptist Association of Churches====
The Sovereign Grace Baptist Association of Churches (SGBA), which was organized in 1984, sponsors an annual national conference and churches cooperate in missions, publications, retreats, camps and other activities. The Missionary Committee serves under the Executive Committee to screen candidates and recommend them to the churches for support. They currently (2009) are supporting one missionary endeavour. The Publication Committee reviews and approves submissions, and supplies literature to the churches. &quot;Grace News&quot; is published quarterly. A Confession of Faith was adopted in 1991. Membership in the SGBA is open to any Baptist church subscribing to the Constitution and Articles of Faith. There are 12 member churches, half of which are located in Michigan. The association is recognised as an endorsing agent for United States military chaplains.

===Africa===
Notable Reformed Baptist figures in Africa include Conrad Mbewe in Zambia, who has been compared to Spurgeon; Kenneth Mbugua and John Musyimi of Emmanuel Baptist Church Nairobi, Kenya.

In South Africa, the Afrikaanse Baptiste Kerke&#x27;s 34 churches follow reformed doctrine, as opposed to the mainly English speaking Baptist Union of Southern Africa, which does not.

===Europe===
There is a small but growing network of Reformed Baptist churches in Europe. The Italian churches are organized in the Evangelical Reformed Baptist Churches in Italy association; several French speaking churches sprung from the work of English missionary Stuart Olyott at the Église réformée baptiste de Lausanne, VD, CH, started in the 1960s. There is a growing network of Reformed Baptist Churches in Ukraine. There are few small communities churches in Germany, where the largest is in Frankfurt am Main. In March 2023, a new national association of churches formed in the United Kingdom, organized as the &quot;Association of Confessional Baptist Churches in the United Kingdom&quot;.

===Brazil===
In Brazil there is a modest association, the Comunhão Reformada Batista do Brasil (Baptist Reformed Communion of Brazil) sprung mostly from the work of US missionary Richard Denham at São José dos Campos, SP. As it did not correspond to expectations of dynamism and effectiveness, it is being supplanted by a newer Convention, the (Baptist Reformed Convention of Brazil).

===Canada===
====Sovereign Grace Fellowship of Canada====

The Sovereign Grace Fellowship of Canada (SGF) is a fellowship for Baptist churches in Canada holding to either the Baptist Confession of 1644 or 1689. SGF had 10 member churches when it was formally inaugurated, located in New Brunswick and Ontario. As of 2012, there were 14 churches, including the Jarvis Street Baptist Church in Toronto. SGF is one of the Baptist groups associated with the Toronto Baptist Seminary and Bible College.

<text>This is a list of official languages by country and territory. It includes all languages that have official language status either statewide or in a part of the state, or that have status as a national language, regional language, or minority language.

== Definitions ==
;Official language: A language designated as having a unique legal status in the state: typically, the language used in a nation&#x27;s legislative bodies, and often, official government business.
;Regional language: A language designated as having official status limited to a specific area, administrative division, or territory of the state. (On this page a regional language has parentheses next to it that contain a region, province, etc. where the language has regional status.)
;National language: A language that uniquely represents the national identity of a state, nation, and/or country and is so designated by a country&#x27;s government; some are technically minority languages. (On this page a national language is followed by parentheses that identify it as a national language status.) Some countries have more than one language with this status.

== List ==


==Number of countries with the same official language==

This is a ranking of languages by number of sovereign countries in which they are &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; official, although there are no precise inclusion criteria or definition of a language. An &#x27;*&#x27; (asterisk) indicates a country whose independence is disputed.

<doc id="320524" wikidata="Q171196" url="?curid=320524" title="Toompea">
<text>Toompea (from , &quot;Cathedral Hill&quot;) is a hill in the central part of Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia. The hill has an area of and is about 20–30 metres higher than the surrounding areas. 
Toompea is part of the medieval Tallinn Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Toompea is the site of the Government of Estonia and the &quot;Riigikogu&quot; (parliament), both of which are often simply referred to as &quot;Toompea&quot;. The parliament meets in the Toompea Castle which is situated in the southwestern corner of the hill and topped by the Pikk Hermann (&quot;Tall Hermann&quot;) tower. The flag on the top of the tower is one of the best-known symbols in Estonia of the government in force.

Toompea first emerged as an island from the Baltic Ice Lake around 10,000 years ago. Due to steady post-glacial rebound it became connected with the mainland during the early Littorina Sea stage. At 5,000 BCE the sea still reached the foot of the cliffs of Toompea. The modern coastline is at a distance of more than 1 km from Toompea and the foot of the hill lies at 17–20 m above sea level. The hill reaches about in elevation.

==History==
The first stronghold is believed to have been built on the hill in either the 10th or 11th century by residents of the ancient Estonian county of Revala. The late Iron Age fortified settlement did not probably have permanent inhabitants, but was rather seasonally used for protecting the harbour and its adjacent marketplace. The exact location of the stronghold is not known, but it is presumed that it occupied only a small portion of Toompea, either its then-highest point a bit southeast of today&#x27;s cathedral or the northern end of the hill. Early archaeological evidence from the hill dates mainly to the second half of the 12th century and first half of the 13th century. Smaller amounts of older finds support the view that the stronghold might have been established already during the Viking Age.
The hill fort is mentioned in the Henry of Livonia&#x27;s Chronicle of the Livonian Crusade by the name &quot;Lindanise&quot;. As part of the crusade, in the summer of 1219 the King of Denmark Valdemar II launched an attack against Tallinn. His crusaders took over the deserted stronghold and at the same summer started building a new castle in its place, later referred to as the &quot;Castrum Danorum&quot;. After the Battle of Lindanise which was fought near the castle and resulted Danish victory over the Estonians, a cathedral was also built on the hill, though it was probably not located in the same place as today&#x27;s cathedral.

In the summer of 1227 the castle at Toompea was conquered by the order of the Brothers of the Sword, who immediately after conquest started to fortify the hill. The plateau was divided into three parts: the Small Castle, the Great Castle and the outer ward (southernmost part of the plateau in front of the two castles). The first stone Castle of the Order (the Small Castle) was built in the southwestern corner of the plateau in 1227-1229. The original castle had roughly the same shape as the later expansions of the castle, but was slightly smaller. The castle was returned to Denmark after the Treaty of Stensby in 1238 and remained its property (together with the rest of Northern Estonia – see Danish Estonia) for the next 138 years. In 1240 building of the cathedral was completed in the place it stands today. In the second half of the 13th century Toompea (the Great Castle) was surrounded with a wall by the hill&#x27;s perimeter, built mainly by vassals who owned the plots there.

Beginning from the same period Toompea started to develop into the centre of provincial authority, clergy and nobility in Northern Estonia. Most of the vassals chose Toompea for their residence – living in their estates in the conquered countryside was deemed too dangerous; by the end of the 13th century the Great Castle was densely populated. The distinction between Toompea and the Lower Town (Tallinn) also developed at the time as Tallinn gained its own administration – at least in 1248, when the King of Denmark Eric IV granted the town Lübeck city rights, but possibly even earlier. In 1265 the Lower Town was exempted from the rule of the castellan and in 1288 the commanders of the castle also lost judicial power over the citizens of the Lower Town.

Construction and expansion works on both castles continued in the subsequent centuries. In the first half of the 14th century the southern wall of the Great Castle was renovated and its moat was joined with the eastern moat of the Small Castle. In this way the outer ward of the castles was built, after its southern and southeastern sides were surrounded with a wall. The castle as a whole had two exits at the time: the more important one was outer ward&#x27;s southern gate, through which the road led to Tõnismägi, the second was the gate at its eastern, which connected Toompea with Lower Town via the Long and Short Legs.
In the aftermath of the St. George&#x27;s Night Uprising, in 1346 Denmark sold its possessions in Northern Estonia and followed 215 years under the rule of the Livonian Order. Tallinn (the Lower Town), which was still subjected to Lübeck city rights and only nominally depended on the feudal system, developed into a flourishing Hanseatic city, while Toompea remained politically and socially antithetical to the Lower Town. The boundaries of the territory of Toompea and Tallinn were fixed with an agreement in 1348, when from the city&#x27;s patrimony was given to Toompea. That area, located southwest of the hill and where the suburbs (Vorstadt) of Toompea (Tõnismäe, Kassisaba and Kelmiküla) were built during subsequent periods, was called &quot;Dome territory&quot; until the 20th century.

Soon after returning to Toompea, the Order started expanding the castle – the whole Castle of the Order () was extended and developed into the strongest centre of its northerly realms, a symbol of their military and political power. New higher outside walls were built, moats were widened and deepened. The first part of the &quot;Pikk Hermann&quot; (&quot;Tall Hermann&quot;) tower, which tops the Toompea castle, was completed by 1371. &quot;Pikk Hermann&quot; was the first tower in Tallinn adjusted for defence in the era of firearms. Later in the 16th century the tower was rebuilt taller, from the original height of 35 m. The wall of the Great Castle was also fortified with new towers: altogether 14 defence towers (including a gate tower named &quot;Clock Tower&quot; – the only exit) had been built along its wall by the end of the 14th century.

The Kingdom of Sweden conquered northern Estonia in 1561, and held it until the Great Northern War, when Tallinn was conquered by the Tsardom of Russia in 1710. When Tallinn capitulated to Eric XIV of Sweden in 1561, the king decided not to change the &quot;status quo&quot; in the relations between Toompea and Lower Town. Toompea, as a separate town (Dom zu Reval) under its own administration was able to retain a variety of special rights and privileges, the last of which remained in the books until 1889. Toompea was joined with Tallinn (Lower Town) as late as in 1878, when during the period of Russification the previous laws governing the two towns were replaced with Russian administrative law. The two parts of the town were also united for a brief period in 1785-1796. Toompea and the Lower Town had been united into a single police district in 1805. Particular private law was in force for Toompea until 1944.

In 1684, Toompea suffered the most devastating fire of its history. Toompea had been affected by earlier fires in 1288, 1433, 1553 and 1581, but the fire of 1684 was much larger in scale, destroying most of the buildings in the Great Castle, including the cathedral. The Small Castle escaped of the fire intact. The fires are one cause why Toompea looks architecturally different and newer from the Lower Town.

In the end of 17th century several plans were made to strengthen the fortifications of Toompea and Tallinn with earthworks and modern bastions. Although a design by Erik Dahlbergh was approved in 1686, construction was slow due to financial difficulties and by the start of the Great Northern War only two bastions had been completed around Toompea as intended - the Swedish Bastion and the Ingermanland Bastion, both protecting Toompea from the south.

Following the Great Northern War and the conquest of Estonia by the Russian Empire, the first half of the 18th century was a period of general neglect for Toompea and also for the castle, which fell into disuse for several decades. The situation changed in the second half of the 18th century: in 1767-1773 the east wing of the castle was completely rebuilt into an administrative building of the Governorate of Estonia by the orders of Catherine II. For constructing the building the southeastern tower of the castle (&quot;Stür den Kerl&quot;) was demolished as were the moats filled in; together with it the outer ward of the castles was designed into a square (the Castle Square, ). The building resembled an aristocratic palace, which prompted the castle acquiring an alternate name: Toompea Palace. The Stenbock House, one of the most remarkable buildings on the northern ledge of the Toompea, was also built in the same period - the intended court house was probably completed by 1792.

Tallinn was removed from the list of fortified towns of the Russian Empire in 1857. This allowed three new roads to be built from the southern end of Toompea over the previous defence structures: the Falgi Road, built in 1856–1857, led to the west to Paldiski Highway, the Toompea Street (1860–1861) led south to Tõnismägi and the Komandandi Street led to the east, close to Harju Gate, where the Independence War Victory Column stands today.

The general look of Toompea changed greatly when the architecturally completely different Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Cathedral was built in 1894-1900. The cathedral, situated on the Castle Square in front of the Toompea Palace, was erected during the period of Russification as a symbol of the czarist rule and Russian dominance. Due to its very prominent location and an immediately recognizable Russian style the cathedral garnered opposition already during the time it was built and in the end of the 1920s and 1930s, in the independent Republic of Estonia, there were even proposals to demolish it.

In 1903, when the Patkuli stairs were built near the northern end of the hill, Toompea got a new access from the direction of the main railway station of Tallinn.

==Toompea today==
The much-rebuilt Toompea Castle – consisting of the czarist era governor&#x27;s palace, walls and towers of the medieval fortress, the expressionist parliament building dating from 1922, plus a few other buildings – now houses the Estonian Parliament. The facade of the classicist governor&#x27;s palace dominates &quot;Lossi plats&quot; (&quot;Castle square&quot;), where the Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Cathedral overtops it. The cathedral, nowadays the main church of the Estonian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate, has become for tourists somewhat of a symbol of Tallinn due to its exotic look, while the opinion of Estonians about it is rather ambiguous. The Lutheran Cathedral (&quot;Toomkirik&quot;) from which the name Toompea was originally derived, is now the seat of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church and has perhaps best retained a medieval look among the buildings of Toompea. Most of the buildings in Toompea date from the 18th and 19th centuries. While the Small Castle has generally preserved its shape, nothing but a few fragments remain of the Great Castle&#x27;s walls and towers.

Other notable sites in Toompea include the building of the Government of Estonia (also known as &quot;The Stenbock House&quot;) and the building of the Estonian Knighthood, which in 1992-2005 housed the Estonian Art Museum and since 2009 is temporarily used by the Estonian Academy of Arts. The Estonian Academy of Sciences is also seated in Toompea, in the Ungern-Sternberg palace (seat of the local German cultural self-government in the interwar period).

Toompea is also the location of several foreign embassies to Estonia, including those of Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the office of the embassy of Canada.

There are several viewing platforms in Toompea offering good views of the surrounding city.

==Geology and topography==
Toompea is a limestone hill covered by an oblong tableland which measures about 400 by 250 metres, has an area of , and is about 20–30 metres higher than the surrounding areas. Geologically Toompea is associated with the North Estonian Klint (itself a subsection of the Baltic Klint). A separate relic klint island, Toompea lies about 1.5 km northwest of the North Estonian Limestone Plateau. The plateau and Toompea are connected with a gently sloped sandstone ridge. From the east, north and west Toompea is bordered for 1.5 km by a cliff with a height of up to 25 m. The southern slope of the hill descends more gently. The upper layer of the hill consists of Ordovician limestone (thickness about 5 m), which is also the main rock exposed at the cliff. However, most of the cliff face has been hidden behind a protective wall and only a few outcrops are left.

==Mythology==
In Estonian mythology Toompea is known as the tumulus mound over the grave of Kalev, erected in his memory by his grieving wife Linda, as described in the national epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;: Linda mourned for Kalev for one month after another till three months had passed, and the fourth was far advanced. She heaped a cairn of stones over his tomb, which formed the hill on which the Cathedral of Revel now stands. English translation by W.F. Kirby, 1895

<text>Pink Flamingos is a 1972 American black comedy exploitation film by John Waters. It is part of what Waters has labelled the &quot;Trash Trilogy&quot;, which also includes &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1974) and &quot;Desperate Living&quot; (1977). The film stars the countercultural drag queen Divine as a criminal living under the name of Babs Johnson, who is proud to be &quot;the filthiest person alive&quot;. While living in a trailer with her mother Edie (Edith Massey), son Crackers (Danny Mills), and companion Cotton (Mary Vivian Pearce), Divine is confronted by the Marbles (David Lochary and Mink Stole), a pair of criminals envious of her reputation who try to outdo her in filth. The characters engage in several grotesque, bizarre, and explicitly crude situations, and upon the film&#x27;s re-release in 1997 it was rated NC-17 by the MPAA &quot;for a wide range of perversions in explicit detail&quot;. It was filmed in the vicinity of Baltimore, Maryland, where Waters and most of the cast and crew grew up.

Displaying the tagline &quot;An exercise in poor taste&quot;, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; is notorious for its &quot;outrageousness&quot;, nudity, profanity, and &quot;pursuit of frivolity, scatology, sensationology and skewed epistemology&quot;. It features a &quot;number of increasingly revolting scenes&quot; that center on exhibitionism, voyeurism, sodomy, masturbation, gluttony, vomiting, rape, incest, murder, animal cruelty, cannibalism, zoophilia, castration, foot fetishism, and concludes, to the accompaniment of &quot;How Much Is That Doggy in the Window?&quot;, with Divine&#x27;s consumption of dog feces &quot;The real thing!&quot; narrator Waters assures us. The film is considered a preliminary exponent of abject art.

The film, at first semi-clandestine, has received a warm reception from film critics and, despite being banned in several countries, became a cult film in subsequent decades. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Notorious criminal Divine lives under the pseudonym &quot;Babs Johnson&quot; with her mother Edie, delinquent son Crackers, and traveling companion Cotton. They share a trailer on the outskirts of Phoenix, Maryland, next to a gazing ball and a pair of plastic pink flamingos. After learning that Divine has been dubbed &quot;the filthiest person alive&quot; by a tabloid paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble attempt to usurp her title.

The Marbles run a black market baby ring: they kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. The proceeds are used to finance pornography shops and a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also earns money by exposing himself—with a large kielbasa sausage or turkey neck tied to his penis—to women and stealing their purses when they flee. Later in the film, one of Raymond&#x27;s would-be targets, a trans woman, thwarts his scheme by exposing her breast, which excites him, and then showing her penis and scrotum, causing Raymond to flee in shock.

The Marbles enlist a spy, Cookie, to gather information about Divine by dating Crackers. Cookie is raped by Crackers while crushing a live chicken between them as Cotton looks on through a window. Cookie then informs the Marbles about Babs&#x27; identity, her whereabouts, and her family—as well as her upcoming birthday party.

The Marbles send a box of human feces to Divine as a birthday present with a card addressing her as &quot;Fatso&quot; and proclaiming themselves &quot;the filthiest people alive&quot;. Worried that her title has been seized, Divine declares that whoever sent the package must die. While the Marbles are gone, Channing dresses in Connie&#x27;s clothes and imitates his employers&#x27; overheard conversations. When the Marbles return home, they are outraged to find Channing mocking them while wearing Connie&#x27;s clothes, so they fire him and lock him in his &quot;room&quot; (a closet) while they head out to do evil deeds until they can return and throw him out for good after searching his stuff.

The Egg Man, who delivers eggs to Edie daily, confesses his love for her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. The Marbles arrive at the trailer to spy on Divine&#x27;s birthday party. The birthday gifts include poppers, fake vomit, lice shampoo, a pig&#x27;s head, and a meat cleaver. Entertainers feature a topless woman with a snake act and a contortionist who flexes his prolapsed anus in rhythm to the song &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;. Disgusted by the outrageous party, the Marbles anonymously contact the police, but Divine and her guests ambush the officers, hack up their bodies with the meat cleaver, and eat them. Afterwards, Edie and The Egg Man are wed, and he carts her off in a wheel barrow.

Divine and Crackers head to the Marbles&#x27; house, where they lick and rub the furniture, which excites them so much that Divine fellates Crackers. They find Channing and he begs to be released, but they are not sympathetic and force him to show them the two pregnant women held captive in the basement. Divine and Crackers free the women and hand them a large knife to deal with the tied-up Channing, stating they can kill him and Divine will do so herself if they aren&#x27;t interested. The women then use the knife to emasculate Channing.

The Marbles burn Divine&#x27;s beloved trailer to the ground; when they return home, their furniture—cursed by being licked by Divine and Crackers—&quot;rejects&quot; them, the cushions flying up and throwing them to the floor when they try to sit down. They also find that Channing has bled to death from his emasculation and the two women have escaped.

After finding the remains of their burned-out trailer, Divine, Crackers, and Cotton return to the Marbles&#x27; home, kidnap them at gunpoint, and bring them to the arson site. Divine calls the local tabloid media to witness the Marbles&#x27; trial and execution. Divine holds a kangaroo court and convicts the bound-and-gagged Marbles of &quot;first-degree stupidity&quot; and &quot;assholism&quot;. Cotton and Crackers recommend a sentence of execution, so the Marbles are tied to a tree, coated in tar and feathers, and shot in the head by Divine.

Divine, Crackers, and Cotton enthusiastically decide to move to Boise, Idaho. Spotting a small dog defecating on the sidewalk, Divine scoops up the feces with her hand and puts them in her mouth—proving, as the voice-over narration by Waters states, that Divine is &quot;not only the filthiest person in the world, but she is also the filthiest actress in the world&quot;.

Divine&#x27;s friend Bob Adams described the trailer set as a &quot;hippie commune&quot; in Phoenix, Maryland, and noted that their living quarters were in a farmhouse without hot water. Adams added that ultimately Divine and Van Smith decided to sleep at Susan Lowe&#x27;s home in Baltimore, and that they would awake before dawn to apply Divine&#x27;s makeup before being driven to the set by Jack Walsh. &quot;Sometimes Divy would have to wait out in full drag for Jack to pull the car around from back, and cars full of these blue-collar types on their way to work would practically mount the pavement from gawking at him,&quot; Adams said.

Divine&#x27;s mother, Frances, later said she was surprised that her son was able to endure the &quot;pitiful conditions&quot; of the set, noting his &quot;expensive taste in clothes and furniture and food&quot;.

John Waters told an interviewer &quot;I was high when I wrote this movie. I was NOT high when I filmed it.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography began October 1, 1971 and ended January 12, 1972. Shot on a budget of only $12,000, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; is an example of Waters&#x27; style of low-budget filmmaking inspired by New York underground filmmakers like Kenneth Anger, Andy Warhol, and brothers Mike and George Kuchar. Stylistically, it takes its cues from &quot;exaggerated seaport ballroom drag-show pageantry and antics&quot; with &quot;classic &#x27;50s rock-and-roll kitsch classics&quot;. Waters&#x27; idiosyncratic style also characterized by its &quot;homemade Technicolor&quot; look, the result of high amounts of indoor paint and make-up was dubbed the &quot;Baltimore aesthetic&quot; by art students at Providence.

===Post-production===
Waters&#x27; rough editing added &quot;random Joel-Peter Witkin-esque scratches and Stan Brakhage-moth-wing-like dust marks&quot; to the film, apart from sound delays between shots. Waters has stated that Armando Bo&#x27;s 1969 Argentine film &quot;Fuego&quot; influenced not only &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, but his other films: &quot;If you watch some of my films, you can see what a huge influence &quot;Fuego&quot; was. I forgot how much I stole. ... Look at Isabel&#x27;s makeup and hairdo in &quot;Fuego&quot;. Dawn Davenport, Divine&#x27;s character in &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, could be her exact twin, only heavier. Isabel, you inspired us all to a life of cheap exhibitionism, exaggerated sexual desires and a love for all that is trash-ridden in cinema.&quot;

===Music===
The film uses a number of mainly single B-sides and a few hits of the late 1950s/early 1960s, sourced from Waters&#x27; record collection, and without obtaining rights. After rights were obtained, a soundtrack CD coincided with the 25th anniversary release of the film on DVD in 1997.

==Release==
&quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; had its world premiere on March 17, 1972, at a screening sponsored by the Baltimore Film Festival. The event was held on the campus of the University of Baltimore, where it sold out for three successive shows. The film had aroused particular interest among fans of underground cinema following the success of &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, which had begun to be screened in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco.
Being picked up by the then-small independent company New Line Cinema, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; was later distributed to Ben Barenholtz, the owner of the Elgin Theater in New York City. At the Elgin, Barenholtz had been promoting the midnight movie scene, primarily by screening Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s acid western film &quot;El Topo&quot; (1970), which had become a &quot;very significant success&quot; in &quot;micro-independent terms&quot;. Barenholtz felt that being of an avant-garde nature, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; would fit in well with this crowd, subsequently screening it at midnight on Friday and Saturday nights. The original trailer used by New Line Cinema did not feature any footage from the actual film, and instead consisted almost entirely of interviews with filmgoers who had just seen the film. This trailer was included in the 25th anniversary re-release.

The film soon gained a cult following of filmgoers who came to the Elgin Theatre for repeat viewings, a group Barenholtz characterized as initially composed primarily of &quot;downtown gay people, more of the hipper set&quot;, but after a while, Barenholtz noted that this group eventually broadened as the film also became popular with &quot;working-class kids from New Jersey who would become a little rowdy&quot;. Many of these cult cinema fans learned all of the lines in the film, and recited them at the screenings, a phenomenon which later became associated with another popular midnight movie of the era, &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975).

===Ban===
The film was initially banned in Switzerland and Australia, as well as in some provinces in Canada and Norway. It was eventually released uncut on VHS in Australia in 1984 with an X rating, but distribution of the video has since been discontinued. The 1997 version was cut by the distributor to achieve an R18+ after it was also refused classification. No submissions of the film have been made since, but it has been said that one of the reasons for which it was banned (as a film showing actual sexual activity cannot be rated X in Australia if it also features violence, so the highest a film such as &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; could be rated is R18+) would now not apply, given that the depiction of actual sex was passed within the R18+ rating for &quot;Romance&quot; in 1999, two years following &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;″ re-release. The film was originally rated as R18 by the Classification Office in New Zealand with no cuts, but was later refused classification on a re-submission in 2024, effectively banning the film.

===Home media===
&quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; was released on VHS and Betamax in 1981, and the re-release in 1997 from New Line Home Video became the second best-selling VHS for its week of release. The film was released in the John Waters Collection DVD box set along with the original NC-17 version of &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot;, &quot;Desperate Living&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Pecker&quot;, and &quot;Polyester&quot;. The film was also released in a 2004 special edition with audio commentaries and deleted scenes as introduced by Waters in the 25th anniversary re-release (&quot;see below&quot;). The film was released on Blu-ray on June 28, 2022, by the Criterion Collection, featuring a new 4K restoration.

===Alternative versions===
* The 25th anniversary re-release version contains a re-recorded music soundtrack, re-mixed for stereo, plus 15 minutes of deleted scenes following the film, introduced by Waters. Certain musical excerpts used in the original version, including Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, had to be removed and replaced in the re-release, since the music rights had never been cleared for the original release.
* Because of this film&#x27;s explicit nature, it has been edited for content on many occasions throughout the world. In 1973, the U.S. screened version edited out most of the fellatio scene, which was later restored on the 25th anniversary DVD. Canadian censors recently restored five of the seven scenes that were originally edited in that country. Hicksville in Long Island, New York, banned the film altogether. The Japanese laserdisc version contains a blur superimposed over all displays of pubic hair. Prints also exist that were censored by the Maryland Censor Board.
* The first UK video release of &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; in November 1981 (prior to BBFC video regulation requirements) was completely uncut. It was issued by Palace as part of a package of Waters films they had acquired from New Line Cinema. The package included &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; (double-billed with &quot;Sex Madness&quot;), &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot; (double-billed with &quot;Cocaine Fiends&quot;), &quot;Desperate Living&quot;, and &quot;Female Trouble&quot;. The 1990 video re-release of &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; (which required BBFC approval) was cut by three minutes and four seconds (3:04), the 1997 issue lost two minutes and forty-two seconds (2:42), and the pre-edited 1999 print by two minutes and eight seconds (2:08).
* The 2009 Sydney Underground Film Festival screened the film in Odorama for the first time, using scratch &#x27;n&#x27; sniff cards similar to the ones used in Waters&#x27; later work &quot;Polyester&quot;.
* John Waters recast the film with children and rewrote the script to make it kid-friendly in a 2014 project, &quot;Kiddie Flamingos&quot;. The 74-minute video features children wearing wigs and costumes modeled on the originals and performing roles originated by Divine, Mink Stole, Edith Massey, and others. Waters has said the new version, filmed in one day with actors drawn mostly from friends&#x27; children, is in some ways more perverse than the original. The film was shown on a continuous loop in the Black Box gallery at the Baltimore Museum of Art from September 2016 through January 2017.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Uproarious and appalling, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; is transgressive camp that proves as entertaining as it does shocking.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. In the &quot;Cult Movies&quot; episode of the UK documentary series &quot;Mark Kermode&#x27;s Secrets of Cinema&quot;, Kermode admitted that &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; is &quot;one of the very few films that I have ever walked out of, when I first saw it as a teenager on a late-night double bill at the Phoenix in East Finchley&quot;. 

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a rare no-stars rating when he reviewed it in 1997 for the 25-year anniversary re-release; he and Gene Siskel did not review the film on their TV show. Ebert described Waters as &quot;a charming man&quot; whose &quot;talent had grown&quot; over the years, and also speculated the controversial material of Waters&#x27;s earliest low-budget films was an &quot;understandable&quot; method to &quot;attract audiences&quot;. But Ebert also felt &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; was perhaps best understood as &quot;a weird kind of documentary&quot; because the transgressive behaviors were not simulated, and added: &quot;stars simply seem not to apply.&quot;

Like the underground films from which Waters drew inspiration, which provided a source of community for pre-Stonewall queer people, the film has been widely celebrated by many in the LGBT community and has been described as &quot;early gay agitprop filmmaking&quot;. This, coupled with its unanimous popularity among queer theorists, has led to the film being considered &quot;the most important queer film of all time&quot;. &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; is also considered an important precursor of punk culture.

Despite Waters having released similar films, such as &quot;Mondo Trasho&quot; and &quot;Multiple Maniacs&quot;, it was &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; that drew international attention. Like other underground films, it fed the rising popularity of midnight movie screenings, at which it generated a dedicated cult following that carried the film for a 95-week run in New York City and ten consecutive years in Los Angeles. For its 25th anniversary, the film was re-released in 1997, featuring a post-film commentary by Waters in which he introduced and discussed deleted scenes, adding fifteen minutes of material. American &quot;New Queer Cinema&quot; director Gus Van Sant has described the film as &quot;an absolute classic piece of American cinema, right up there with &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, and &quot;Boom!&quot;&quot; The Library of Congress inducted &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; to the National Film Registry in December 2021.

==Influence==

===Divine===
The final scene in the film would prove particularly infamous, involving the character of Babs eating fresh dog feces; as Divine later told a reporter, &quot;I followed that dog around for three hours just zooming in on its asshole&quot; waiting for it to empty its bowels so that they could film the scene. In an interview not in character, Harris Milstead revealed that he soon called an emergency room nurse, pretending that his child had eaten dog feces, to inquire about possible harmful effects (there were none). The scene became one of the most notable moments of Divine&#x27;s acting career, and he later complained of people thinking that &quot;I run around doing it all the time. I&#x27;ve received boxes of dog shit – plastic dog shit. I have gone to parties where people just sit around and talk about dog shit because they think it&#x27;s what I want to talk about&quot;. In reality, he remarked, he was not a coprophile but only ate excrement that one time because &quot;it was in the script&quot;.

Divine asked his mother, Frances Milstead, not to watch the film, a wish that she obliged. Several years before his death, Frances asked him if he had really eaten dog excrement in the film, to which he &quot;just looked at me with that twinkle in his blue eyes, laughed, and said &#x27;Mom, you wouldn&#x27;t believe what they can do nowadays with trick photography.

===Cultural influence===
The film has a reputation as a midnight movie classic cult with audience participation similar to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;.
* &quot;The Funday PawPet Show&quot; holds what is called the &quot;Pink Flamingo Challenge&quot;, in which the ending to the film is played to the audience while they eat a (preferably chocolate) confection. Videos of the show are forbidden from showing the clip, only the reaction of the audience.
* Theater patrons often received free &quot;Pink Phlegmingo&quot; vomit bags.

Death metal band Skinless sampled portions of the Filth Politics speech for the songs &quot;Merrie Melody&quot; and &quot;Pool of Stool&quot;, both on their second album, &quot;Foreshadowing Our Demise&quot;.

Joe Jeffreys, a drag historian, mentioned seeing in &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; a poster for the documentary film &quot;The Queen&quot; (1968), featuring Flawless Sabrina, and stated that it influenced his career path to document the history of drag with the Drag Show Video Verite.

===Cancelled sequel===
Waters had plans for a sequel, titled &quot;Flamingos Forever&quot;. Troma Entertainment offered to finance the picture, but it was never made, as Divine refused to be involved, and Edith Massey died in 1984.

After reading the script, Divine had refused to be involved as he believed that it would not be a suitable career move, for he had begun to focus on more serious, male roles in films like &quot;Trouble in Mind&quot;. According to his manager, Bernard Jay, &quot;What was, in the early seventies, a mind-blowing exercise in Poor Taste, was now, we both believed, sheer Bad Taste. Divi[ne] felt the public would never accept such an infantile effort in shock tactics some fifteen years later and by people fast approaching middle age.&quot;

The script for &quot;Flamingos Forever&quot; would later be published in John Waters&#x27; 1988 book &quot;Trash Trio&quot;, which also included the scripts for &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot; and &quot;Desperate Living&quot;.

<doc id="320529" wikidata="Q131675513" url="?curid=320529" title="Reynard the Fox">
<text>Reynard the Fox is a literary cycle of medieval allegorical Dutch, English, French and German fables. The first extant versions of the cycle date from the second half of the 12th century. The genre was popular throughout the Late Middle Ages, as well as in chapbook form throughout the Early Modern period.

The stories are largely concerned with the main character Reynard, an anthropomorphic red fox, trickster figure. His adventures usually involve his deceiving other anthropomorphic animals for his own advantage, or trying to avoid their retaliatory efforts. His main enemy and victim across the cycle is his uncle, the wolf, Isengrim (or Ysengrim).

While the character of Reynard appears in later works, the core stories were written during the Middle Ages by multiple authors and are often seen as parodies of medieval literature, such as courtly love stories and chansons de geste, as well as a satire of political and religious institutions. The trickster fox, Reynard, lives in a society of other talking animals (lion, bear, wolf, donkey, etc), making the stories a beast epic.

The original copies were written in Old French, and have since been translated into many different languages. However, the tales of Reynard come from all across Europe and each retelling has details that are specific to its area. The tales, no matter where they take place, are designed to represent the society around them and include the structures of society around them, such as a noble court. While the authors take many liberties with the story telling, not all of the satire is meant to be rude or malicious in intent.

==Characters==
The main characters are anthropomorphic animals. The given names of the animals are of Old High German origin. Most of them were in common use as personal names in medieval Lorraine. The characters of Reynard the Fox were based on the medieval hierarchy, and are treated as human throughout the tales. Since multiple authors wrote the text, characters&#x27; personalities often change. Throughout the stories, these characters often switch between human and animal form and often without notice. 

The characters who switch between human and animal form are often those of elite status, while the characters who don&#x27;t change tend to be peasants. Often, the readers will find themselves able to empathize with Reynard. They find that the situations he is in are not often that different from their own lives, and this carries across the decades. The common usage of animals as characters in tales has made it so the stories that touch on morally gray areas are easier to understand and accept.

*&quot;Reynard the Fox&quot;. The given name &quot;Reynard&quot; is from &quot;Reginhard, Raginohardus&quot; &quot;strong in counsel&quot;. Because of the popularity of the Reynard stories, &quot;renard&quot; became the standard French word for &quot;fox&quot;, replacing the old French word for &quot;fox&quot;, which was &quot;&quot; from Latin &quot;&quot;. Since Reynard has been written about in many different times and places across the world, it is not uncommon to see changes in his appearance to fit the natural surroundings of his story. His fur is often used as a camouflage, meaning if the story was written in a snowy landscape he will have white fur, or yellow fur for desert areas, in the wooded areas of forest he is depicted in red.

*&quot;Bellin the Ram&quot;
*&quot;Martin the Ape&quot;, who had a son named Moneke, that may be source of the word &quot;monkey&quot;.

==In medieval European folklore and literature==
Foxes in general have the reputation of tricksters in traditional European folklore. The specific character of Reynard is thought to have originated in Lorraine folklore, from where it spread to France, Germany, and the Low Countries. Alternatively, a 19th-century edition of a retelling of the Reynard fable states definitively with &quot;no doubt whatever that it is of German origin&quot; and relates a conjecture associating the central character with &quot;a certain Reinard of Lorraine, famous for his vulpine qualities in the ninth century&quot;.

Joseph Jacobs, while seeing an origin in Lorraine, traces classical, German, and &quot;ancient northern folk-lore&quot; elements within the Reynard stories. Jacob Grimm in his &quot;Reinhart Fuchs&quot; (Berlin, 1834) provided evidence for the supposition on etymological grounds that &quot;stories of the Fox and Wolf were known to the Franks as early as the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries&quot;.

From the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there are around twenty-six different tales of Reynard the Fox. While there might have been more that were written, these are the ones that survive. Many of these are written by different authors and anonymous authors. 

An extensive appearance of the character is in the Old French &quot;Le Roman de Renart&quot; written by Pierre de Saint-Cloud around 1170, which sets the typical setting. Reynard has been summoned to the court of king Noble (or Leo), the lion, to answer charges brought against him by Isengrim the wolf. Other anthropomorphic animals, including Bruin the bear, Baldwin the ass, and Tibert (Tybalt) the cat, all attempt one stratagem or another. The stories typically involve satire, whose usual butts are the aristocracy and the clergy, making Reynard a peasant-hero character. The Catholic Church used the story of the preaching fox, as found in the Reynard literature, in church art as propaganda against the Lollards. 

Reynard&#x27;s principal castle, Maupertuis, is available to him whenever he needs to hide away from his enemies. Some of the tales feature Reynard&#x27;s funeral, where his enemies gather to deliver maudlin elegies full of insincere piety, and which feature Reynard&#x27;s posthumous revenge. Reynard&#x27;s wife Hermeline appears in the stories, but plays little active role. In some versions she remarries when Reynard is thought dead, thereby becoming one of the people he plans revenge upon. Isengrim, alternate French spelling: &quot;Ysengrin&quot;, is Reynard&#x27;s most frequent antagonist and foil, and generally ends up outwitted, though he occasionally gets revenge.

An individual tale might span several genres, which makes classification difficult. Tales often include themes from contemporary society with references to relics, pilgrimage, confession, and the crusades. There is debate over whether or how closely they related to identifiable societal events, but there is a growing camp that see direct societal connections and even implicit political statements in the tales. The stories are told in a way that makes associations easy to make, but difficult to substantiate.

Reynard stories translate difficult laws and legal concepts into common language, allowing people to both understand them and enjoy the legal predicaments and antics of the characters. The court operates just as those in medieval society. The king heard cases only on one specified date, and all disputes were heard at once.

Many versions follow Reynard&#x27;s fights with Ysengrin, the fox&#x27;s regular antagonist throughout the stories. Violence between them and other characters is a common thematic element. It is a matter of debate whether the violence shows animals simply acting as such, or is anthropomorphically meant to reflect the violence in human society, especially the various wars that common folk endured at the time.

===&quot;Ysengrimus&quot;===
Reynard appears first in the medieval Latin poem &quot;Ysengrimus&quot;, a long Latin mock-epic written c. 1148–53 by the medieval poet Nivardus, that collects a great store of Reynard&#x27;s adventures. He also appears in a number of Latin sequences by the early-13th-century preacher Odo of Cheriton. Both of these early sources seem to draw on a pre-existing store of popular culture featuring the character.

=== &quot;Roman de Renart&quot; ===
The first &quot;branch&quot; (or chapter) of the &quot;Roman de Renart&quot; appears in 1174, written by Pierre de St. Cloud, although in all French editions it is designated as &quot;Branch II&quot;. The same author wrote a sequel in 1179—called &quot;Branch I&quot;. From that date onwards, many other French authors composed their own adventures for Renart &quot;li goupil&quot; (&quot;the fox&quot;). There is also the Middle High German text &quot;Reinhard Fuchs&quot; by Heinrich der Glïchezäre, dated to 1180. Roman de Renart fits into the genre of romance. Roman de Renart gets its start using the history of fables that have been written since the time of Aesop. 

The romance genre of the middle ages is not what we think of the romance genre of today. It was a fictional telling of a character&#x27;s life. The protagonist of the romance genre often has an adventure or a call to action, almost always caused by an outside force. In the 13th century, French was a standard literary language, and many works during the Middle Ages were written in French, including Reynard the Fox. Many popular works from the Middle Ages fall into the romance genre.

Pierre de St. Cloud opens his work on the fox by situating it within the larger tradition of epic poetry, the fabliaux and Arthurian romance:
===&quot;Van den vos Reynaerde&quot;===

A mid-13th-century Middle Dutch version of the story by Willem die Madoc maecte (&quot;Van den vos Reynaerde&quot;, Of Reynaert the Fox), is also made up of rhymed verses (the same AA BB scheme). &quot;Van den vos Reinaerde&quot; and &quot;Reinaert Historie&quot; (referred to as R I and R II, respectively) are two poems written by two different authors with R II being a continuation of R I.

With different writers comes different variations. This can best be seen with Reynard. While describing the same character the Reynard from R I has many different character traits of that in R II. While a finished and completed poem by itself, Van den vos Reinaerde does not have a set ending.

Like Pierre, very little is known of the author, other than the description by the copyist in the first sentences:


&quot;Madocke&quot; or &quot;Madoc&quot; is thought to be another one of Willem&#x27;s works that at one point existed but had been lost. The &quot;Arnout&quot; mentioned was an earlier Reynard poet whose work Willem (the writer) alleges to have finished. However, there are serious objections to this notion of joint authorship, and the only thing deemed likely is that Arnout was French-speaking (&quot;Walschen&quot; in Middle Dutch referred to northern French-speaking people, specifically the Walloons). Willem&#x27;s work became one of the standard versions of the legend, and was the foundation for most later adaptations in Dutch, German, and English, including those of William Caxton, Goethe, and F. S. Ellis.

===Chaucer===
Geoffrey Chaucer used Reynard material in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;; in &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Reynard appears as &quot;Rossel&quot; and an ass as &quot;Brunel&quot;. Renyard (spelt &quot;Renard&quot;) is also briefly mentioned in The Legend of Phyllis from Chaucer&#x27;s The Legend of Good Women.

==Early Modern tradition==

In 1481, the English William Caxton printed &quot;The Historie of Reynart the Foxe&quot;, which was translated from &quot;Van den vos Reynaerde&quot;. Also in the 1480s, the Scottish poet Robert Henryson devised a highly sophisticated development of Reynardian material as part of his &quot;Morall Fabillis&quot; in the sections known as &quot;The Talking of the Tod&quot;. In 1498, Hans van Ghetelen, a printer of Incunabula in Lübeck, printed a Low German version called &quot;Reinke de Vos&quot;. It was translated to Latin and other languages, which made the tale popular across Europe. Reynard is also referenced in the Middle English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; during the third hunt.

Tybalt in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is named after the cat in Reynard the Fox, and is called &#x27;Prince of Cats&#x27; by Mercutio in reference to this.
Jonson&#x27;s play &quot;Volpone&quot; is heavily indebted to Reynard.

With the invention of the printing press, the tales of Reynard the fox became more popular and started to be translated and recreated in many different languages. The tales of Reynard don&#x27;t follow the typical sense of reprinting, as there is no clear chronology to the stories. Many of the original pages to these stories have been lost, so it is difficult to tell what the exact literary changes are, of which there aren&#x27;t many, with the exception of the typical changes that are seen from the early days of the printing press. 

There are also slight changes to the wording that show modernization of the uses and differing orders of the words. While the changes might appear to be mistakes, they are not thought of as such and are often kept in the modernization of the tales. There haven&#x27;t been many attempts to better the works in during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Changes to the tales during the fifteenth century are not seen as mistakes because of specific roles in the process of printing designed to eliminate mistakes. In the early modern editions of Reynard the Fox, the characteristics of the animals were based on literary topoi, appealing to the middle class reader.

==Modern treatment==

===19th century ===
&quot;Reinecke Fuchs&quot; by Goethe is a poem in hexameters, in twelve parts, written 1793 and first published 1794.
Goethe adapted the Reynard material from the edition by Johann Christoph Gottsched (1752), based on the 1498 &quot;Reynke de vos&quot;.

In Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s 1889 &quot;The Twilight of the Idols&quot;, Nietzsche uses Reynard the Fox as an example of a dialectician.

German artist Johann Heinrich Ramberg made a series of thirty drawings, which he also etched and published in 1825.

&quot;Renert&quot; [full original title: &quot;Renert oder de Fuuß am Frack an a Ma&#x27;nsgrëßt&quot;], was published in 1872 by Michel Rodange, a Luxembourgeois author. An epic satirical work—adapted from the 1858 Cotta Edition of Goethe&#x27;s fox epic &quot;Reineke Fuchs&quot; to a setting in Luxembourg. It is known to be a satirical mirror image of Luxembourg&#x27;s social sphere after the turmoils of the Luxembourg Crisis, whereby the author transposed his criticism and social scepticism to the animal society in which his fox &#x27;Renert&#x27; lives. Beyond that, it is insightful analysis of the different regional and sub-regional linguistic differences of the country, where distinct dialects are used to depict the fox and his companions.

===20th century ===
Ladislas Starevich produced &quot;The Tale of the Fox&quot; in 1937.

Disney&#x27;s Robin Hood animated film from 1973 is partly based on Reynard the Fox.

===21st century===

In the SyFy fantasy television show The Magicians (which aired from December 2015 to April 2020) there is a Pagan trickster god played by Mackenzie Astin named Reynard the Fox.

<doc id="320530" wikidata="Q848386" url="?curid=320530" title="Palazzo Farnese">
<text>Palazzo Farnese () or Farnese Palace is one of the most important High Renaissance palaces in Rome. Owned by the Italian Republic, it was given to the French government in 1936 for a period of 99 years, and currently serves as the French embassy in Italy.

First designed in 1517 for the Farnese family, the building expanded in size and conception when Alessandro Farnese became Pope Paul III in 1534, to designs by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Its building history involved some of the most prominent Italian architects of the 16th century, including Michelangelo, Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola and Giacomo della Porta.

At the end of the 16th century, the important fresco cycle of &quot;The Loves of the Gods&quot; in the Farnese Gallery was carried out by the Bolognese painter Annibale Carracci, marking the beginning of two divergent trends in painting during the 17th century, the Roman High Baroque and Classicism. The famous Farnese sculpture collection, now in the National Archeological Museum of Naples, as well as other Farnese collections, now mostly in Capodimonte Museum in Naples, were accommodated in the palace.

==History==

&quot;The most imposing Italian palace of the 16th century&quot;, according to Sir Banister Fletcher, this palazzo was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, one of Bramante&#x27;s assistants in the design of St. Peter&#x27;s and an important Renaissance architect in his own right. Construction began in 1515 after one or two years of preparation, and was commissioned by Alessandro Farnese, who had been appointed as a cardinal in 1493 at age 25 and was living a princely lifestyle. Work was interrupted by the Sack of Rome in 1527.

When, in January 1534 Alessandro became Pope Paul III, the size of the palace was increased significantly and he employed Michelangelo who completed the redesigned third story with its deep cornice and revised the courtyard as well. The post-1534 developments were not only a reflection of Alessandro&#x27;s change in status but employed architecture to express the power of the Farnese family, much as at their Villa Farnese at Caprarola. The massive palace block and its facade dominate the Piazza Farnese.

Architectural features of the main facade include the alternating triangular and segmental pediments that cap the windows of the piano nobile, the central rusticated portal and Michelangelo&#x27;s projecting cornice which throws a deep shadow on the top of the facade. Michelangelo revised the central window in 1541, adding an architrave to give a central focus to the facade, above which is the largest papal &quot;stemma&quot;, or coat-of-arms with papal tiara, Rome had ever seen. When Paul appeared on the balcony, the entire facade became a setting for his person. The courtyard, initially open arcades, is ringed by an academic exercise in ascending orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian). The &quot;piano nobile&quot; entablature was given a frieze with garlands, added by Michelangelo.

On the garden side of the palace, which faced the River Tiber, Michelangelo proposed the innovatory design of a bridge which, if completed, would have linked the palace with the gardens of the Vigna Farnese, Alessandro&#x27;s holding on the opposite bank, that later became incorporated into the adjacent villa belonging to the Chigi family, which the Farnese purchased in 1584 and renamed the Villa Farnesina. While the practicalities of achieving this bridge remain dubious, the idea was a bold and expansive one.

During the 16th century, two large granite basins from the Baths of Caracalla were adapted as fountains in the Piazza Farnese, the &quot;urban&quot; face of the palace.

The palazzo was further modified for the papal nephew Ranuccio Farnese by Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola. It was completed for the second Cardinal Alessandro Farnese by Giacomo della Porta&#x27;s porticoed facade towards the Tiber which was finished in 1589.

Following the death of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in 1626, the palazzo stood virtually uninhabited for twenty years. At the conclusion of the War of Castro with the papacy, Duke Odoardo was able to regain his family properties, which had been sequestered. The resulting inventory is the oldest surviving complete inventory of Palazzo Farnese.

After Odoardo&#x27;s death, Pope Alexander VII allowed Queen Christina of Sweden to lodge in the palace for several months, but she &quot;proved a tenant from hell&quot;. After her departure for Paris, the papal authorities discovered that her unruly servants not only had stolen the silver, tapestries, and paintings, but also had &quot;smashed up doors for firewood&quot; and removed sections of copper roofing.

==Interior decorations==
Several main rooms were frescoed with elaborate allegorical programs including the Hercules cycle in the &quot;Sala d&#x27;Ercole&quot; or the Hercules Room, the &quot;Sala del Mappamondo&quot; or The Room of Maps, and the well known &quot;The Loves of the Gods&quot; (1597–1608) in the Farnese Gallery, both by the Bolognese painter Annibale Carracci. Other rooms have frescoes by Daniele da Volterra and by other artists.

For generations, the room with Herculean frescoes accommodated the famous Greco-Roman antique sculpture known as the &quot;Farnese Hercules&quot;. Other works from the family collection of classical sculpture were also housed in the palace.

One of the vault and ceiling fresco by Annibale Carracci is &quot;Galleria Farnese&quot;, an art gallery. According to Ann Sutherland Harris, &quot;The Galleria frescoes make even more extensive use of ancient sculptural and architectural sources, and in addition take their basic structure from two ceilings by the most prestigious artists of the High Renaissance in Rome, the Loggia of Psyche by Raphael and Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling&quot;. Carracci adopted the &quot;quadri riportati&quot;, which the ceiling is divided into units and turned it into a collection of framed paintings, along with the cast masks among the garlands, and carved putti, and sculptures supporting the central scene. This large central scene depicts the triumphal progress of Bacchus and Ariadne. Two smaller paintings are attached to the top and bottom of the central picture, and two vertical pictures on either side, filled with sphinxes, Pan, and two satyrs.

==Inspired works==
The Palazzo&#x27;s design has inspired several buildings outside Italy, including the Detroit Athletic Club in Detroit, Michigan; Château Grimaldi near Aix-en-Provence, France; the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., US; the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Building in Sydney; the Banco di Roma in Alexandria, Egypt; the Royal Palace, Stockholm, and the Cunard Building in Liverpool. Also in England, Charles Barry&#x27;s great admiration for the building led him to use it as the model for London&#x27;s Reform Club.

==Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;==
In Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Tosca&quot; (1900), set in Napoleonic Rome, the heroine&#x27;s confrontation with the malevolent chief of police, Scarpia, takes place in Palazzo Farnese. The Palazzo was inherited from the Farnese by the Bourbon kings of Naples, from whom the French government purchased it in 1874. Though the government of Benito Mussolini ransomed it in 1936, the French Embassy remains, under a 99-year lease for which they pay the Italian government a symbolic fee of 1 euro per month.

==Palazzo Farnese library==
The Palazzo Farnese houses the great scholarly library amassed by the Ecole Française de Rome, concentrating especially on the archeology of Italy and medieval Papal history. The Ecole Française de Rome embarked on a massive project of publishing as much of the documentation of the constructing of the palazzo, its frescoes and furnishings, library and works of art, fully annotated and indexed. The first three volumes are:
* F.C. Uginet, &quot;Le palais farnèse à travers les documents financiers&quot; (Rome 1980).

<text>The Bobo Ashanti (also variously called Bobo Shanti and Bobo Shanty), also known as the Ethiopian African Black International Congress (E.A.B.I.C.), is a religious group originating in Bull Bay near Kingston, Jamaica.

The Bobo Ashanti are one of the strictest Mansions of Rastafari. They cover their dreadlocks with bright turbans and wear long robes and can usually be distinguished from other Rastafari members because of this. While some Nyabinghi and Twelve Tribe of Israel Rastas drink wine and are either vegetarians or omnivores (eating plants, animals, and fungi), the Bobo Ashanti are all strictly vegan and stick to the biblical restrictions regarding their vow; they also add extra restrictions to their diet, e.g. they do not eat mangoes or sugarcane. Twice each week and on the first Sunday of every month, the Bobos fast. Almost all songs and tributes within the community end with the phrase &quot;Holy Emmanuel I Selassie I Jah I Rastafari.&quot; &quot;I&quot; symbolizes unity. Bobo Ashanti do smoke marijuana like the other mansions of Rastafari, but do not do so in public because it is a sacred practice to be done at times of worship. Even though it is the &quot;holy herb&quot;, production is not allowed in the Bobo Shanti commune as marijuana used to be illegal in Jamaica, although it is now legal for use by Rastafari.

== Origin ==
The &quot;Bobo Ashanti&quot; (&quot;Bobo&quot; meaning &quot;wrap&quot; or &quot;tie&quot; from the &quot;Twi&quot; word Abotire meaning &quot;crown&quot; the verb abo - to tie &quot;singular&quot;; bobo &quot;plural&quot;); and &quot;Ashanti&quot; in reference to the Ashanti people of Ghana, whom most Jamaicans have descent from), were founded by Emmanuel Charles Edwards in 1958 during the period known as the &quot;groundation&quot;, where many protests took place calling for repatriation of African descendants and slaves to Kingston. Emmanuel Charles Edwards was the leader of the protests who was to be called King when he was badly beaten by authorities for his action. After this event, he formed the mansion of Bobo Ashanti as a separatist movement from those who did not strictly follow the principles of Rastafari. He established the first Bobo Ashanti community in Kingston, which then settled in Bull Bay, where most of the members live today. The Bobo Ashanti consider their mansion to be the &quot;Priesthood Order&quot; of Rastafari, as they hold the most radical theology and offer theological training and accreditation. Those who become priests, prophets, or Empresses are to abide by EABIC principles in their home country. The community in Bull Bay is very tight knit and a place of refuge for poor people, as it offers free shelter, food, and education.

Prince Emmanuel is called &quot;Dada&quot; by his followers, which was a name taken from Idi Amin, who was called Idi Amin Dada. Emmanuel is also seen by the Bobos as part of a triad - together with Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie I, where Selassie is regarded as King, Garvey as prophet, and Emmanuel as high priest. Marcus Garvey is praised by the Rastafarians for his call for pan-Africanism, which looks to unite Africans all over the world and achieve gender, social, and economic equality. In his Farewell Speech in 1916, Garvey announced the future crowning of a Black King, the spot which Haile Selassie filled as the leader of the Black Nation and Messiah. He is considered the reincarnation of the King Alpha, and Empress Menen is considered the reincarnation of Queen Omega.

== Gender hierarchy ==
Bobo Ashanti women hold a traditional yet nuanced social role. Similar to traditional religious and cultural standards, men are in charge of work outside the home and the financials, while the woman is to maintain the home life and children. The respective titles of a woman and man in a relationship are &quot;Empress&quot; and &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Kingman&quot;, or &quot;head&quot;. Women must cover their legs, arms, and hair with a turban. Men in the Bobo Ashanti community are considered Priests as they conduct religious services and gatherings.

== Bobo Ashanti in pop culture ==
The genre of Reggae arose in the 1960s as a form of cultural expression and communication for Rastafarians in Jamaica, especially through the Nyabinghi mansion of Rastafari thanks to the Nyabinghi drums. Reggae grew as a powerful tool to inspire change in society concerning racism and liberalism, a central theme in Rastafari.
Unlike other Rastafari groups, the Bobo Ashanti are against Reggae music, claiming it is satanic. Despite this, beginning in the mid-1990s, many reggae artists have emerged from the Bobo Ashanti; the most well known among them are Sizzla, Capleton, Anthony B, Lutan Fyah, Turbulence, Ras Shiloh. These artists&#x27; actual affiliation with the Bobo community and religiosity is unclear, as some speculate their Bobo Ashanti identity is used more as a defining characteristic and fashion statement. For example, Sizzla highlights the dreads worn by Bobo Ashanti in one of his songs with lyrics: &quot;Bun fire pon men weh have locks and still nah go Rastaman Tabernacle... you see dem in the clubs and you see dem in the pubs, and they never ever step beneath the Tabernacle roof&quot;, suggesting disconnect with faith but still maintaining culture. Capleton embraces the Bobo Ashanti&#x27;s religiosity and resistance to Westernized dress and fashion appearance in his music, with lyrics like, &quot;Call Bobo Ashanti from the hill top, Separate the wolf from the sheep flock.&quot; The &quot;sheep flock&quot; here being Bobo Ashanti and other pure Rastafarians and the &quot;wolf&quot; being &quot;fake&quot; Rastas who are still eating animal flesh, and also other meat eaters. For decades, Rasta singers have sung songs about &quot;wolves in sheep clothing&quot;. Wolves are flesh-eating predators, but by contrast, sheep are gentle vegans, living under the protection of their shepherd. Rastas liken themselves to sheep, living under the protection of Jah Rastafari, the Good Shepherd. Their wooly hair matted into locks is like the fleece of a sheep. Sizzla often refers to those Rastas who grow locks but have not renounced the eating of animal flesh (as per Numbers Chapter 6), as &quot;wolf under wool&quot;.

Other artists such as Beenie Man commend the work of Emmanuel, but do not necessarily favor the splitting of the Rastafari religion into branches, with lines like, &quot;Now Emmanuel dead, everything tumble down, The Hill divided in a three, separated bu three sons.&quot; On the other hand, there is a trend for young Bobo artists to be heroes or defendants of the Bobo Ashanti community. Artists like Capleton remain true to the Bobo Ashanti spirit and make statements like, &quot;We, a di whole a we deh inna Selassie family, but Jah.&quot;

The conservative and strict nature of the Bobo Ashanti is sometimes compared to that of Islamic fundamentalism by the Rastas from more moderate and less strict mansions. Artists such as Midnite and Lutan Fyah have even gone as far as to call Bobos &quot;the Jamaican Taliban&quot;, as both artists have used the term &quot;Bobo Shanti Taliban&quot; in their music. The metaphor also alludes to the attire and turbans worn by Bobos, even though they are different in color and style. Bobo Ashanti artist Junior Reid expresses these ideas in his music, claiming immigration would ask him questions about where he was at the time of the bombing and people mistaking him for an Arab.

<text>Pierre Jacques Étienne, 1st Viscount Cambronne (26 December 1770 – 29 January 1842), was a general of the First French Empire. A main strategist of the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, he was wounded at the Battle of Waterloo.

==Military career==
Cambronne was born in Saint-Sébastien-sur-Loire, a commune near Nantes, in the modern department of Loire-Atlantique. He joined the Grenadiers as a volunteer in 1792, serving under Charles François Dumouriez in Belgium, in the Vendée, took part in the battle of Quiberon, then in the expedition to Ireland under Hoche in 1796. He then joined the Army of the Alps under André Masséna, where he was promoted to command of a grenadier company at the Battle of Zurich (1799).

In 1800, he commanded a company under Latour d&#x27;Auvergne, and later succeeded him as First Grenadier of France. He was made a Colonel at the Battle of Jena in 1806, given command of the 3rd Regiment of the Voltigeurs of the Guard in 1810, and was made a Baron the same year. (&quot;Voltigeur&quot;, a French word meaning &quot;vaulter&quot; or &quot;leaper&quot;, was a designation given to elite light infantry units in the French Army, who acted as advance units of the main column.)

Cambronne then fought in Spain, then joined La Grande Armée. In Russia he commanded the 3rd Regiment of Voltigeurs of the Guard, and took part in the battles of Bautzen, Dresden, and Leipzig, before being promoted to General.

==The hundred days and Waterloo==

He became major of the Imperial Guard in 1814, and accompanied Napoléon into exile to the island of Elba, where he was a military commander. He then returned with Napoléon to France on 1 March 1815 for the Hundred Days, capturing the fortress of Sisteron (5 March), and was made a Count by Napoléon when they arrived at Paris. Cambronne was seriously wounded at the Battle of Waterloo and was taken prisoner by the British. He subsequently married the nurse who cared for him.

The exact circumstances of his surrender to the British are disputed. At the battle&#x27;s conclusion, Cambronne was commanding the last &quot;carré&quot; (section) of the Old Guard when General Colville called on him to surrender. According to a journalist named Rougement, Cambronne replied: &quot;La garde meurt mais ne se rend pas !&quot; (&quot;The Guard dies but does not surrender!&quot;). These words were often repeated and put on the base of a statue of Cambronne in Nantes after his death. 

Other sources reported that Colville insisted and ultimately Cambronne replied with one word: &quot;Merde!&quot; (literally, &quot;Shit!&quot;, figuratively, &quot;Go to hell!&quot;) This version of the reply became famous in its own right, becoming known as &quot;le mot de Cambronne&quot; (&quot;the word of Cambronne&quot;) and repeated in Victor Hugo&#x27;s account of Waterloo in his novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and in Edmond Rostand&#x27;s play &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;. The name Cambronne was later used as a polite euphemism (&quot;What a load of old Cambronne!&quot;) and sometimes even as a verb, &quot;cambronniser&quot;.

Cambronne always denied both Rougement&#x27;s account and the one-word response, stating that he could not have said such a thing and remained alive. A series of letters to &quot;The Times&quot; claimed that British Colonel Hugh Halkett, commanding the 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, captured Cambronne before he made any reply.

&quot;The Guard dies ...&quot; statement has also been ascribed to General Claude-Étienne Michel. In July 1845 the sons of General Michel requested a royal decree stating that the words attributed to General Cambronne had in fact been said by their father, producing a number of witnesses and published historical works as evidence.

Cambronne was tried for treason in France, but well defended by the royalist Antoine Pierre Berryer, he was acquitted on 26 April 1816. He later married Mary Osburn, the Scottish nurse who had cared for him after Waterloo.

In 1820, Louis XVIII made him Commandant at Lille with the rank of brigadier, and made him a viscount. He retired to his birthplace in 1823, dying there in 1842. A statue of Cambronne was erected in Nantes in 1848, and a square in Paris, the &quot;Place Cambronne&quot;, also commemorates him.

He was buried in Cemetery Miséricorde, Nantes.

He makes a fictional appearance in C. S. Forester&#x27;s Hornblower short story &quot;St. Elizabeth of Hungary&quot;. Hornblower discovers Cambronne in the West Indies engaged in an attempt to rescue Napoleon from Saint Helena. Cambronne&#x27;s exact words at Waterloo are discussed.

<text>The IRIS-T (infrared imaging system tail/thrust vector-controlled) is a family of short range infrared homing air-to-air and short to medium range surface-to-air missiles. It is also called AIM-2000.

The missile was developed in the late 1990s–early 2000s by a German-led program to produce a short to medium range infrared homing air-to-air missile to replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder in use by some NATO member countries at the time. A goal of the program was for any aircraft capable of firing the Sidewinder to also be capable of launching the IRIS-T. The air-to-air variant was fielded in 2005.

Surface-to-air defence systems variants came later, with the short-range IRIS-T SLS fielded in 2015, and the medium-range IRIS-T SLM fielded in 2022. One IRIS-T SLM battery, as supplied by Germany to Ukraine, consists of three truck-mounted launchers, carrying eight missiles each (with a range of ), and a separate command vehicle that can be positioned up to away. The command vehicle integrates multiple radar sources, and is able to launch and track all 24 missiles simultaneously. The IRIS-T SLM can counter cruise missiles, including low-flying, stealthy missiles such as the Kalibr.

==History==

=== Background ===
In August 1980, the USA, the UK, Germany and France signed a Memorandum of understanding which aimed to develop two types of AAMs to replace existing ones. The USA developed the Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) to replace the AIM-7 Sparrow, while the Europe team developed the Advanced Short-Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) to replace the AIM-9 Sidewinder. This work was dusted off for the UK–German effort, with the Germans providing a new seeker, and the UK providing most of the remaining components.

In 1987, after years of silence on the program, the US proposed a requirement that the weapon must use Sidewinder rails rather than the universal aircraft rail adaptor named the &quot;missile support unit&quot; that had been developed. This delayed the project by one year as the British, German and Norwegian proposals were redesigned. Fearing erosion of its industrial base, the US proposed it would choose the latest version of its existing Sidewinder design with increased manoeuvrability and IRCCM unless the European partners increased the US industrial workshare, designated AIM-9X. However, the Sidewinder upgrade proposal failed to interest NATO buyers.

After German reunification in 1990, Germany found itself with large stockpiles of the Soviet Vympel R-73 missiles (NATO reporting name: &quot;AA-11 Archer&quot;) carried by the MiG-29 Fulcrum and concluded that the AA-11&#x27;s capabilities had been noticeably underestimated. It was one of the earliest 4th generation WVRAAM which were more capable in dogfight than the former 3rd generation ones. In 1990, Germany withdrew from the ASRAAM project, while the UK resolved to find another seeker and develop ASRAAM according to the original range requirement. In 1992, the missile development programme ultimately separated with the UK the ASRAAM, France the MBDA MICA, US the AIM-9X and Germany electing to restart development on what became the IRIS-T.

===Development===
In 1995, Germany announced the start of the IRIS-T development, in collaboration with Greece, Italy, Norway, Sweden and Canada. In 1997, Germany had invested more than 500 million DM in this project and held a 46% share. In addition, Italy accounted for 20%, Sweden 18%, Greece 8%, Canada 4% and Norway 3%. Canada later dropped out, while Spain joined as a procurement partner in 2003. The German Air Force took first delivery of the missile in December 2005.

NAMMO Raufoss supplies the rocket engine with its TVC (thrust vector control) for both the IRIS-T air-to-air missile and the SL variants.

==Missile characteristics==
In comparison to the AIM-9M Sidewinder, the IRIS-T has higher ECM resistance and flare suppression. Improvements in target discrimination allow for five to eight times longer head-on firing range than the AIM-9L and three to four times longer target acquiring range than the AIM-9M. Its seeker can receive cues from radar, helmet mounted display, infrared search and track device, missile approach warner and data link. It can engage targets behind the launching aircraft, made possible by extreme close-in agility, allowing turns of 60 &quot;g&quot; at a rate of 60°/s via thrust vectoring and LOAL capability.

The IRIS-T belongs to 5th generation IR-guided missiles which introduce infrared imaging seeker. Compared to the other 5th generation IR-guided missiles, such as AIM-9X, ASRAAM which use staring array, the IRIS-T uses an InSb two-colour seeker based around a 128x2 linear array and a scanning mirror which builds an image from a row of detector elements and scans rapidly across the target. It would produce a 128x128 size image 80 times per second. Each of the elements has a resolution in milliradians. It was regarded to have good resistance against DIRCM. Bodenseewerk Gerätetechnik GmbH (BGT) claimed that scanning arrays were less susceptible than staring arrays as the former receive the DIRCM energy for fractions of a second whereas the latter receive it continuously.

The IRIS-T is able to intercept fast-moving and miniature targets, such as air-to-air/surface-to-air missiles and air-to-surface/surface-to-surface missiles and rockets, UAV/drones, and cruise missiles. To improve the probability of a direct hit, the missile is equipped with a Ku band active radar proximity fuze.

The IRIS-T has the unique ability, in comparison to other similar missiles such as the AIM-9X, to target and shoot down other air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, thus offering a 360° defence capability. Surface launched variants of the IRIS-T, the IRIS-T SLS and IRIS-T SLM, have enhanced capabilities to destroy aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles, air-to-surface missiles, anti-ship missiles, anti-radar rockets and large-calibre rockets. They have a high probability of a killing shot against UAVs and other small manoeuvring threats at very-short and medium-range distances.

The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) has tested a new air-to-surface capability developed by Diehl BGT Defence for the IRIS-T. A proof of concept test firing to acquire, track, and engage a target representing a small fast attack boat was conducted in Norway in September 2016, where the IRIS-T missile was launched from an RNoAF F-16AM multirole aircraft. For the air-to-surface role, the missile retains the same standard IRIS-T AAM hardware configuration, including the HE warhead and IIR guidance package, with only an updated software insertion required to deliver the additional ground attack capability. This basic air-to-ground capability provides the ability to acquire, track and engage individual ground targets like boats, ships, small buildings and vehicles.
==Variants==

=== Operational ===
By June 2024, three variants were available: The initial &quot;IRIS-T&quot; air to air missile with 25 km range, &quot;IRIS-T SLS&quot; (short range) with 12 km range and 8 km altitude and &quot;IRIS-T SLM&quot; (medium range) with 40 km range and 20 km maximum altitude. A third variant, &quot;IRIS-T SLX&quot; (long range) variant with a dual-mode (IR and RF) seeker, a range of 80 km and a maximum altitude of 30 km, is in development .

Due to increased demand due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Diehl Defence is increasing production of IRIS-T systems and missiles. It plans to produce three to four systems in 2024 and at least eight in 2025, with missile production planned to grow to around 400 to 500 per year starting in 2024.

==== IRIS-T air-to-air missile ====
It is the initial variant of the IRIS-T missile.

==== IRIS-T SLS ====

IRIS-T SLS (Surface Launched Standard) is the air defence system which uses the IRIS-T AAM with few software modifications. However, its operational range is reduced from 25 km to 12 km, as has the ceiling from 8 to 6 km. It has a maximum speed of Mach 2 and average speed of 400 m/s, and it cannot attack targets that are closer than 1 km. In 2018, Diehl Defence demonstrated a Bv 410-based IRIS-T SLS system integrated with a Saab Giraffe 1X radar during the ILA.

In 2019, the Swedish Army fielded a ground launched version of the IRIS-T SLS, designated &quot;Luftvärnsrobotsystem 98&quot; (lvrbs 98), to replace the RBS 70 missile system. Four missiles are carried on Eldenhet 98 (elde 98) launcher, a special version of a Bv 410 tracked, armored vehicle. Compared to the one demonstrated on the ILA 2018, there was no radar on the Swedish Eldenhet 98. Instead, the Swedish Army used the Underrättelseenhet 23 radar truck as its radar unit.

The Norwegian Army ordered the &quot;mobile ground based air defence system&quot;, based on NASAMS command and control solutions, in a direct acquisition with Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace. The system will integrate tracked IRIS-T SLS launchers from Diehl Defence GmbH with High Mobility Launchers for AIM-120 and AIM-9X missiles and radars from Weibel Scientific; initial delivery is planned for 2023 and will include six modified M113 vehicles carrying IRIS-T SLS missiles, while additional launchers will be based on the ACSV.

In 2022, Diehl Defence showed a new air defense system called IRIS-T SLS Mk. III at the Eurosatory. It was a modified Mowag Eagle 6×6 armored vehicle integrated with IRIS-T SLS launcher, Hensoldt Spexer 2000 3D AESA, and a .50 machine gun in the remote controlled weapon station. Its STANAG 4569 protection was level 1, and it could be upgraded to level 3 by adding armor kit. This vehicle had integrated the missile launcher, the radar, the sensors and the C2 command system, making it able to operate independently as an air defence system.

==== IRIS-T SLM====
IRIS-T SLM (Surface Launched Missile) is the air defence system which uses the IRIS-T SL missile. As a part of the NATO MEADS program, the German Air Force and others are now using this missile. It has a pointed nose, unlike the regular IRIS-T, with a jettisonable drag-reducing nose cone. The missile uses a GPS-aided inertial navigation system, with radio data link for command guidance during the initial approach. The interference-resistant IR seeker head is activated at the terminal stage.

Compared to the IRIS-T, the diameter of the rocket motor was increased by 25 mm, to 152 mm. Test launches from a battery consisting of a CEA CEAFAR radar, a Diehl IRIS-T SL launcher and an Oerlikon Skymaster battle management system were performed in 2014. The IRIS-T SL qualification tests were completed in January 2015 at the Denel Overberg Test Range in South Africa. A further fire test on the developed system of the IRIS-T SLM was completed in January 2022.

An IRIS-T SLM air defence system consists of a tactical operation center, a logistic support unit, several radar units, and 3 or 4 missile trucks. The IRIS-T SLM can be integrated with a variety of electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) guidance systems and AESA radars, such as Hensoldt TRML-4D, Thales Ground Master 200 MM/C, CEA CEAFAR, and Saab Giraffe 4A. A version with a Lockheed-Martin Skykeeper command and control station, Giraffe 4A radar and Diehl IRIS-T SLM launcher was shown at IDEX 2019 under the name Falcon Ground Based Air Defence.

Egypt ordered Diehl IRIS-T SLM launchers, Hensoldt TRML-4D radars, and fire and control stations equipped with Airbus Defence Fortion IBMS integrated battle management software, all mounted on MAN 8×8 military trucks; the deal was approved by the German government in December 2021. Further orders includes Hensoldt passive radars, IRIS-T SLS launchers and IRIS-T SLX long-range missiles. Passive radars can detect enemy aircraft by analysing reflections from external radio and television signals, making them effective in urban areas where active radars struggle.

The German Air Force has received its first IRIS-T SLM system in 2024 and is to receive five more by 2027. Also, mixed SLS/SLM systems are being planned.

===In development===

==== IRIS-T AAM Block 2 ====
In June 2024, Diehl Defence revealed that they were working on a new variant of IRIS-T AAM which will benefit from a new seeker, replacement electronics and a data link capability. 

The German parliament approved its financing in December 2024. The contract was signed in January 2025. In February 2025, Sweden, Italy and Spain also join the effort to modernise the IRIS-T missile.

==== IRIS-T FCAAM air-to-air missile ====

Diehl mentioned in 2022 that it was working on a 6th generation of short-range air-to-air missiles, and it is known as the &quot;Future Combat Air-to-Air Missile&quot;. This missile is being designed to become one of the weapons of the European Future Combat Air System. Some new features of IRIS-T FCAAM might include a stealthy non-cylindrical cross-section, multiple-spectrum IR sensor, advanced data processing, a two-way datalink, and a dual pulse/multi-pulse rocket motor.

==== IRIS-T SLX ====
IRIS-T SLX is an upgraded variant of IRIS-T surface-to-air missile which has the operational range of 80 km and ceiling of 30 km. It will also use a combined radar and infrared seeker. On the ILA 2024, Diehl Defence displayed a missile model of the developing IRIS-T SLX, which looked quite different to both IRIS-T AAM and IRIS-T SL. This new missile can be integrated into the IRIS-T SLM launchers, which can be loaded with a mix of SL and SLX missiles as the result. Only 50 to 60 soldiers are needed for each system. The Diehl Defence chief programme officer Harald Buschek said this variant was capable of countering standoff weapons, and it was likely to be ready for operation within around 4 years. It also would retain the ability to engage cruise missiles and helicopters.

==== IRIS-T HYDEF ====
The Hypersonic Defence (HYDEF) is a program for missile defense against hypersonic threats. The consortium of this project consists of 13 companies from seven European nations. The HYDEF project is based on the successful contract signing in July 2022, dealing with a project study of an overall endo-atmospheric interceptor concept for air defence. At that time, the HYDEF project prevailed over the competitor and could win the Europe-wide tender. Hensoldt and Airbus are also involved as national partners in the HYDEF project. On 31 October 2023, SMS (Spanish Missile Systems, a collaborative proposal of , GMV and SENER AEROSPACIAL from Spain) and Diehl Defence signed the contract with OCCAR, marking the official start of the project. It has the operational range of 100 km and ceiling of 50 km.

On the ILA 2024, Diehl Defence revealed that they were working on a two-stage missile to defend against hypersonic weapons. It will consist of a booster as a starting engine and a warhead called &quot;Kill vehicle&quot; for the direct hit. This should enable it to attack targets at a distance of up to 100 km and an altitude of 50 km with a high level of agility. It should refer to IRIS-T HYDEF.

==== IRIS-T air-to-surface missile ====
For the air-to-surface role, the only difference from air-to-air version is an updated software insertion required to deliver the additional ground attack capability. Tested by the Royal Norwegian Air Force.

==== Naval surface-to-air missile ====
Diehl mentioned that the IRIS-T SLM missile was being integrated to the Mark 41 vertical launching system.

The German procurement agency BAAINBw signed a contract with Diehl for a feasibility study to integrate the IRIS-T SLM to the (F125) in December 2024. This contract includes a risk analysis, and the production of a system demonstrator. 

==== IDAS ====

The IDAS variant is a naval version of the missile, and is also being developed for the new Type 212A submarine of the German Navy. IDAS is supposed to engage air threats, small or medium surface vessels or near land targets.

The latest stage of development qualification is planned for 2024. In October 2022, the Germany Ministry of Defense revised the budget proposal and canceled the project to buy the IDAS.

==== LFK NG ====

LFK NG was a surface-to-air variant that was developed by the Diehl BGT Defence and MBDA/LFK for the Germany air defence plan called SysFla (). Its weight is 28 kg, which is just one third of the original IRIS-T AAM. It would be equipped on the Army&#x27;s Ozelot air defence system and Eurocopter Tiger. It has the operational range of 10 km. In 2012, the German Army air defence units was disbanded. There&#x27;s no further news about this variant afterward.

==Operational usage==

=== Egypt ===
The first IRIS-T SLM system was delivered in 2021 to Egypt, and trials followed, seeing the successful downing of two drones.

=== Ukraine ===
On 24 October 2022, at the opening of the 5th Business Forum on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal noted that German IRIS-T system had the highest successful hit rate among others in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and it could destroy 9 out of 10 Russian missiles.

Following another Russian missile attack against Ukraine on 31 October 2022, the Ukrainian Air Force stated that IRIS-T missiles had a 100% success rate countering the attack.

On 15 November, 2022 footage appearing to show the IRIS-T system shooting down two cruise missiles circulated. One missile appeared to be a Kalibr cruise missile.

During the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, a TRML-4D multi-functional radar from the IRIS-T SLM air defense system was reportedly damaged by a Russian ZALA Lancet drone, with the extent of damage unclear. According to Ukraine, the system remained functional.

As of October 2023 Germany had transferred to Ukraine three IRIS-T air defense systems.

On 23 November 2023, the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced that an additional four IRIS-T SLM medium-range air defense systems would be supplied to Ukraine as part of a military aid package worth more than €1.3 billion (US$1.4 billion). The systems will be supplied from 2025. The package also includes drones and drone-defense systems, demining vehicles, satellite communications, electronic warfare equipment, directional anti-tank mines and artillery shells.

By June 2024, Helmut Rauch, the CEO of Diehl Defense claimed that 240 kills were achieved by the IRIS-T SLM and SLS in Ukraine with an almost 100% success rate.

=== Germany ===

<text>The music of [[Taiwan]] reflects the diverse culture of Taiwanese people. Taiwan has undergone several economic, social, and political changes through its cultural history, and Taiwanese music reflects those issues in its way. The music of the country has adopted a mixed style. As a country rich in Chinese folk culture and with many indigenous tribes with their own distinct artistic identity, various folk music styles are appreciated in Taiwan. In addition, people in Taiwan highly appreciate various style of Western classical music and pop music. Taiwan is a major Mandopop hub.

==Background==
The Kuomintang-led Republic of China government arrived in Taiwan in 1949, a government that suppressed native Taiwanese culture and implemented Standard Chinese (Mandarin) as the official language. This political event has significant effects on the development of music in Taiwan in the 20th century as it resulted in a gap in the transition of the traditional music culture. In 1987, a revival of traditional culture began when the martial law declared by the government was lifted. (See &quot;Taiwanese localization movement&quot;.)

Instrumental music includes multiple genres, such as &quot;beiguan&quot; and &quot;nanguan&quot;. &quot;Nanguan&quot; originally hails from Quanzhou, while it is now most common in Lukang and is found across much of the island.

Taiwanese puppetry (hand-puppet theater) and Taiwanese opera, two genres of spectacle that are strongly related to music, are very popular, while the latter is often considered the only truly indigenous Han form of music still extant today.

Holo folk music is most common today on the Hengchun Peninsula in the southernmost part of the island, where performers sing accompanied by yueqin (&quot;moon lute&quot;), which is a type of two-stringed lute. While the Hengchun yueqin plays only five tones, the pentatonic music can become diverse and complex when combined with the seven tones of Taiwanese Hokkien. Famous folk singers include Chen Da and Yang Hsiuching.

==Aboriginal music==

Of the two broad divisions of Taiwanese aborigines, the plains-dwellers have been largely assimilated into Han culture, while the mountain-dwelling tribes remain distinct. The Amis, Bunun, Paiwan, Rukai and Tsou are known for their polyphonic vocals, of which each has a unique variety.

Once dying, aboriginal culture has undergone a renaissance since the late 20th century. A full-time aboriginal radio station, &quot;Ho-hi-yan&quot; was launched in 2005 with the help of the Executive Yuan, to focus on issues of interest to the indigenous community. [Listen to &quot;Ho-hi-yan&quot;; requires Windows Media Player 9]. This came on the heels of a &quot;New wave of Indigenous Pop,&quot; as aboriginal artists such as A-mei (Puyuma tribe), Difang (Amis tribe), Pur-dur and Samingad (Puyuma) became international pop stars. Later artists include Paiwanese pop star Abao.

The 1991 formation of the Formosa Aboriginal Dance Troupe was another major contributor to this trend, while the surprise mainstream success of &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;, the theme song to the 1996 Olympic Games, further popularized native musics. &quot;Return to Innocence&quot; was made by Enigma, a popular musical project and sampled the voices of an elderly Amis couple, Kuo Ying-nan and Kuo Hsiu-chu. When the couple found out that their recording had become part of an international hit, they filed suit and, in 1999, settled out of court for an unidentified amount.

===Bunun===
The Bunun&#x27;s original home was on Taiwan&#x27;s west coast, in the central and northern plains, but some have more recently settled in the area around Taitung and Hualien.

Unlike the other indigenous peoples of Taiwan, the Bunun have very little dance music. The best-studied element of traditional Bunun music is improvised polyphonic song. Folk instruments include pestles, five-stringed zithers and the jaw harp.

In modern times, David Darling, an American cellist, created a project to combine cello and Bunun traditional music, resulting in an album titled &quot;Mudanin Kata&quot;. The Bunun Cultural and Educational Foundation, founded in 1995, was the first organization established to help promote and sustain Taiwanese aboriginal culture.

==Hakka==

Traditional Hakka music is made up of three types: Hakka Bayin (客家八音), Shan&#x27;ge (山歌, Mountain or Hill song), and Beiguan (北管).

Bayin references the eight materials that have traditionally been used to make Chinese instruments: metal, stone, earth, skin, string, wood, gourd, and bamboo (金、石、土、革，絲、木、匏、竹). It is believed that Hakka Bayin came from a type of wind and percussion ensemble music known as Chungchunban (中軍班). Hakka Bayin was thought to have been brought to Taiwan sometime between the end of the Ming Dynasty and the start of the Qing Dynasty. It is often used in Hakka daily life, such as at festivals, weddings, or funerals.

Hakka Shan&#x27;ge is the most popular of the three types. It literally means “mountain song” or “hill song.” Shan&#x27;ge has traditionally been sung while people work, particularly during tea picking. Because of this, it consists mostly of improvisations and has not been transcribed. Recently, shan&#x27;ge has gained popularity as one of the markers of Hakka culture. This type of music includes the well-known Nine Accents and Eighteen Melodies (九腔十八調), whose definitions are a point of debate.

Beiguan is not only Hakka music, as it generally references music in the area north of Fujian. Out of the two types, instrumental and vocal, instrumental is more popular, and like Bayin, is often utilized in events like weddings and ceremonies. 

These three forms of music have been reutilized in Hakka orchestral music. Hakka orchestral music utilizes a mixture of Western orchestral instruments and Chinese traditional musical instruments, like the Erhu (二胡) and the Suona (嗩吶). This is in part because the Hakka Affairs Council has encouraged those trained in Western music in Taiwan to compose Hakka orchestral music. The first Hakka piano concerto, “Heavy Rain” (落大雨) was composed by Sung-Jen Hsu (徐頌仁) in 1985, whereas the first Hakka orchestral work, &quot;Hakka Shange Capriccio&quot; (客家山歌隨想曲)&quot;,&quot; was finished by Jung-Sung Hsu (徐榮松) in 1996. 

== Art music==
The earliest musical education program in Taiwan was established by Western missionaries during the 17th century, when southern and northern Taiwan was under the colonial rule of the Netherlands and Spain respectively. Missionaries from Europe set up their churches throughout Taiwan for evangelical purposes; this included Protestant missionaries from the Netherlands and the Catholic Dominican Order from Spain. During this period, Western music was first introduced to Taiwan, though church music was the mainstay. It wasn&#x27;t until the ruling Qing government opened up to trade exchanges with Europe in the mid-19th century that secular Western music began to gain to a foothold in Taiwan. In 1895, Taiwan became occupied by Japan, and formalized Western music education was thus introduced. Under Japanese rule, music was included as part of the core curriculum of Taiwanese academic education and became a compulsory course of study. Notable musicians from this era included Wen-ye Jiang and Chih-yuan Kuo.

=== Qing dynasty rule === 
Rule by the Qing dynasty began in Taiwan in the 18th century; Taiwan&#x27;s music scene at the time was still largely dominated by Beiguan and Nanguan music brought over by immigrants from mainland China. However, in the middle of the 19th century, the armies of the Qing dynasty suffered one devastating loss after another against European troops, forcing the Qing government to open up the ports to European traders and missionaries. As trade between Taiwan and Europe flourished, the European Chambers of Commerce and Industry set up branches in Taiwan, setting the stage for strong Western influence and an influx of more Christian missionaries. In 1872, Canadian missionary George Leslie Mackay established Presbyterian churches in Tamsui (formerly known as Huwei), as well as schools and hospitals. He also introduced Western liturgical music and art music education to Taiwan, founding Oxford College (now the Taiwan Graduate School of Theology) and Aletheia University. Su-Ti Chen (1911–1992), one of the first-generation Taiwanese composers, was an alumnus of TamKang High School (now TamKang Senior High School), which was founded by Dr. Mackay&#x27;s eldest son, George William Mackay. Su-Ti Chen studied piano and Western liturgical music alongside Margaret Gauld, the wife of Rev. William Gauld. After his graduation, he enrolled at the Taipei Seminary School (now the Taiwan Graduate School of Theology), majoring in Western Art Music. Afterwards, he continued his music studies in Japan.

Meanwhile, Dr. James Maxwell, a Presbyterian/Calvinist missionary from England, began preaching in southern Taiwan in 1865. In 1869, he and Rev. Hugh Ritchie together established “The Student’s Class” in Cihou and Taiwan Fu (now Tainan), which were coalesced by Reverend Thomas Barclay in 1876 into the Capital College, the first western-education university in Taiwan and the predecessor of the current Tainan Theological College and Seminary affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan. The seminary not only had the goal of evangelizing and cultivating theological students, but also brought Western liturgical music and art music to southern Taiwan through mandated courses for its students, nurturing many musical talents in southern Taiwan. To this day, “cultivation of musical talent” remains one of the most important goals of the Tainan Theological College and Seminary.

During Qing dynasty rule, Taiwan&#x27;s churches played a major role in the spread of Western music through congregation members, foreign merchants, and missionaries.

=== During Japanese rule === 
In 1894, the First Sino-Japanese War began, during which the army of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the Japanese army. This led to the Qing dynasty government signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan. In 1895, Japanese rule of Taiwan began, leading to a formal introduction of a Western music education system in the core curriculum of Taiwanese schooling. From then on, Western art music became a firmly-rooted element in Taiwan&#x27;s musical scene, with Western art music courses becoming mandatory in Taiwanese schools. Su-Ti Chen, one of the first-generation Taiwanese composers, received his formal music education in Taiwan schooling before traveling to Japan for further study.

Tyzen Hsiao, a composer born in Fongshan, Kaohsiung, was taught to play the piano by his mother, who was one of the first-generation pianists to study in Japan. Afterwards, he received further training from Prof. Fu-mei Li, who also studied piano in Japan. Graduating from the Christian Chang Jung High School, Hsiao enrolled in the two-year music program of the Taiwan Provincial Teachers College (predecessor of the National Taiwan Normal University), before continuing his studies in Japan.

From the life history of these Taiwanese composers, we can clearly trace the development of the culture of Western music in Taiwan through two sources. One is the church system and the other the Western music education introduced during the Japanese rule and musicians returning to Taiwan after studying abroad in Japan. Many of the works by these musicians were liturgical, including those written by Su-Ti Chen; although other musicians such as Chuan-sheng Lu and Chih-yuan Kuo created original folk songs. They also composed large-scale works: Chih-yuan Kuo produced the opera Xu-Xian and Madame White Snake, while Chuan-sheng Lu produced Castrated Chicken, a Taiwanese Hokkien opera that attracted the attention of the Japanese ruling class for its incorporation of Western composition techniques.

=== After 1949 === 
The government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in 1949. Due to political factors, cultural elements related to mainland China and Russia, including symbols of communism, became taboos in Taiwan, and Western culture became especially prominent. Musicians and music students from mainland China also came to Taiwan to pursue their music education.

After the Second World War, Taiwan&#x27;s political atmosphere and economic situation shifted abruptly, a change which was reflected in contemporaneous music activity. Scholar Edwin A. Winckler divided the post-war development of Taiwan&#x27;s music into three periods in his Cultural Policy on Postwar Taiwan (1994):

# 1945–1960
# 1960–1975
# 1975–1990

In 1946, the school that was known as Taihoko High School during the era of Japanese rule, was renamed the Taiwan Provincial Teachers&#x27; College, and became an important center for cultivating music teachers. In 1955, it was again renamed to Taiwan Provincial Normal University; at this time, Er-hua Xiao from Fujian Music College, Ou Kang and Cui-lun Dai from Shanghai Music College (the predecessor of Shanghai Conservatory of Music), and others joined its faculty, and redesigned the music educational system of Taiwan. At the same time, Taiwanese musicians who had traveled to Japan for study, such as Ci-mei Gao and Cai-xiang Zhang, also joined the faculty after their return to Taiwan, resulting in the school&#x27;s music educational curriculum reflecting the principles of two different systems. At the time, Taiwan&#x27;s art music was greatly influenced by post-romantic music from the West. This was particularly distinct in the works of the alumni of Taiwan Provincial Normal University, including Tyzen Hsiao, Tsang-houei Hsu, and others.

The National Taiwan Academy of the Arts (the predecessor of today&#x27;s National Taiwan University of Arts) was established in Banqiao, Taipei County (now New Taipei City), in 1955. Through the effort of the successive directors of its music program, including vocalist Xue-yong Shen, Wei-liang Shih (1926–1977), and others, numerous professional performers and composers received trainings that blended the Western theory of composition together with elements of traditional Chinese music, and used Western composition techniques to reinterpret the classics of Chinese literature. For example, The Song of Pipa for a female soloist and orchestra, composed by Wei-liang Shih, adapted the poem of the same title written by poet Juyi Bai of the Tang dynasty as its lyrics. This modern music work combined the Chinese pentatonic scale and western polyphony and atonality. It was premiered at Taipei&#x27;s Armed Forces Cultural Center in 1968, with soprano Sai-yun Liu as the female vocalist, and Cui-lun Dai conducting the Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra (predecessor of today&#x27;s National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra) as accompaniment. This piece was known to be the late composer&#x27;s favorite of his works. Other alumni of the National Taiwan Academy of Arts included musicians Tai-xiang Li, Chang-fa Yu, and others.

Composers of this generation were deeply influenced by the heritage of Chinese culture, with deep cultural literacy and awareness of local trends, enabling them to excel at combining Western music and classic Chinese literature together. For example, Shui-long Ma portrayed his hometown Keelung in his Suite Taiwan for Piano Solo. In his later Bamboo Flute Concerto, the piece which brought him fame as a composer, he combined the Chinese pentatonic scale and the orchestration of Western music together, not only showcasing the performance skills of the bamboo flutist, but also bringing Taiwanese music to a whole new level. The Bamboo Flute Concerto was selected as the theme song of the Broadcasting Corporation of China based on its reputation as a monumental Taiwanese musical piece. This piece was followed by Shui-long Ma&#x27;s symphonic suite Xiang Yu and His Concubine, a work based on the history of the Chu-Han Contention in ancient China. Originally written in the form of a singspiel with spoken dialogue, Ma used traditional Chinese instruments in place of the vocals. For example, the bass part for the character Xiang Yu is replaced by the suona, the soprano part for Consort Yu is replaced by the nanhu, and the tenor part for Liu Bang is replaced by the pipa. Combining Chinese traditional instruments and a Western orchestra, this symphonic suite weaves exchanges between these three traditional instruments throughout. Xiang Yu and His Concubine won the Best Art Music Album award at the 26th Golden Melody Awards for Traditional Arts and Music.

The music conservatory serves as a base for cultivating musical talents, while the establishment of musical organizations founded by patrons supports a variety of musical events. The Association of Taiwanese Culture was established by Taiwan&#x27;s elite Hsien-tang Lin, the scholar Mosei Lin, politician Mi-chien Yu, and others in 1946 for actively promoting musical activities. Musicians returning from their studies in Japan, including Chih-yuan Kuo, Chuan-sheng Lu, and Erh Lin, and others, were fervent in creating new pieces for the events held by this society. However, during this period of post-war reconstruction, these events were unsuccessful in attracting attention and support.

In 1955, Chih-yuan Kuo wrote the Symphonic Variation in Taiwanese Style for Orchestra, the first orchestral piece by a Taiwanese composer. With themes celebrating Taiwan&#x27;s beautiful scenery and folk music, the work was premiered by Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra. In 1972, Kuo wrote the Concertino for Piano and String Orchestra, the first piano concerto by a Taiwanese composer.

Students studying composition at Taiwan Provincial Normal University and the National Taiwan Academy of Arts received a great deal of exposure to Chinese traditional music, operas, and works written by Chinese composers from the first half of the 20th century, such as art songs by Tzu Huang, Yuen-ren Chao, Bao-chen Li, and Xue&#x27;an Liu, and others, in their tutelage led by musicians from mainland China. After these students graduated, some taught music at schools, such as Yen Lu, while some worked as researchers or orchestral musicians in the Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra, including Loong-hsing Wen, Hsuan-wen Chang, and Deh-ho Lai, etc. In their spare time, these graduates collected and analyzed Taiwanese folk music, and blended it with Western composition theory to develop a new form of contemporary art music belonging to Taiwan.

The Division of Research for the Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra was established by its former director Wei-liang Shih in 1972. He invited several alumni of the National Taiwan Academy of Arts and composers returning from abroad to join this division, including Deh-ho Lai, Loong-hsing Wen, Chang-fa Yu, among others. These young composers founded the Music Society of the Sunflower in 1967. In addition to the composers mentioned above, Mau-liang Chen, Chin-tang Shen, and Shui-long Ma, also alumni of the National Taiwan Academy of Arts, were also members of this society.

=== Private music organizations === 
Tsang-houei Hsu, who studied abroad in France before returning to Taiwan to teach at Taiwan Provincial Normal University, founded the Assembly for Composition in 1961. This group did not have fixed members, with Tsang-houei Hsu inviting different composers to write pieces for each concert. In 1961, New Music in First Performance, an orchestra for the performance of modern music, was founded by the violinist Chang-guo Deng, Japanese pianist Anna Azusa Fujita, Hsien-liang Koo, Tsang-houei Hsu, Kuo-huang Han, and others in order to perform modern music both in Taiwan and overseas. Other important groups during this period included the Chiang Lang Music Assembly and The Five. They held concerts to present their own works as well as conduct international exchanges.

The Asian Composers League - National Committee and The Composers’ Association of the Republic of China (ACL-ROC) was co-founded by Tsang-houei Hsu, Yoshiro Nabeshima (Japan), Yoshiro Irino (Japan), Sheng-shih Lin (Hong Kong), and Un-young La (Korea) in 1973 in order to exchange ideas about music with other Asian composers. Through this organized system for carrying out international exchange of contemporary art music, development of Taiwan&#x27;s contemporary art music expanded greatly. Frequent and regular cross-cultural exchange also helped improve the composing standard for Taiwan&#x27;s art music significantly and many notable composers arose.

At the time, the art music of Taiwan, in addition to new musical styles that combined Chinese and Western music, also encompassed abstract musical styles influenced by Modernism. When Tsang-houei Hsu returned to Taiwan after his studies in France, he brought with him the latest contemporary music trends of Europe, including serialism music. Although this style was not widely accepted in Taiwan, his students at Taiwan Provincial Normal University and the National Taiwan Academy of Arts were influenced by this musical theory. Works written by Hwang-long Pan (1945- ) used this modern musical language, enhancing the sonority and ambiance of sound. Compared to works written by his contemporaries, Pan&#x27;s compositions were more abstract. For example, his quartet for the clarinet, percussion, piano, and cello Labyrinth - promenade places great emphasis on mood and atmosphere. In recent years, Hwang-long Pan has worked closely with the Chai Found Music Workshop, an ensemble that focuses on the performance of contemporary art music in Taiwan. In addition to performing traditional Chinese music, the Chai Found Music Workshop also utilizes Chinese traditional instruments to perform contemporary art music. It has presented numerous works written by contemporary Taiwanese composers at many international contemporary art festivals.

=== Since 1980 ===
The development of Western art music in Taiwan primarily took place in educational institutions, both public and private. The earliest such music programs included those at Taiwan Provincial Normal University and the National Taiwan Academy of Arts, as well as Chinese Culture University (1962)¸ Shih Chien College of Home Economics (today&#x27;s Shih Chien University, 1969), Soochow University (1972), Fu Jen Catholic University (1983), and the National Institute of the Arts (predecessor of today&#x27;s Taipei National University of the Arts, 1982). After the 1980s, all the junior teachers colleges were restructured into teachers&#x27; colleges, allowing the founding of several departments and institutes of music. These new programs trained numerous music teachers for different types of schools and also promoted general enthusiasm for music. Around the same time, the United Experimental Orchestra (predecessor of the National Symphony Orchestra) and the National Chiang Kai-Shek Cultural Center (predecessor of the National Theater and Concert Hall) were established respectively in 1986 and 1987. Together, they held a series of concerts with many Taiwanese and overseas musicians invited to perform and commissioned new pieces from local composers. All of this contributed to the vigorous growth of musical activities in Taiwan. Musical talents flourished in large numbers and the standards for composition and performance shot up markedly. Leading musicians at the time included Hwang-long Pan, Shing-kwei Tzeng, Fang-long Ke, Nan-chang Chien, Shan-hua Chien, and Shu-si Chen.

At the suggestion of Dr. Robert Scholz, Taiwan began to send talented music students for pursuing further study abroad in the 1960s. The earliest students selected included pianists Pi-hsien Chen, Lina Yeh, and Tai-cheng Chen, among others, who went to Europe for their musical studies. After they graduated, some of them remained overseas, while others returned to Taiwan and devoted themselves to education. Several of these music talents have won awards in renowned international music competitions. Examples include pianist Siao-pei Yang, who won the third place in the Concours international d&#x27;exécution musicale de Genève in 1967; pianist Pi-hsien Chen, who won the first place in the Internationaler Musikwettbewerb der ARD in 1974; Nai-yuan Hu, who was the first-place winner of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition in 1985; and Yu-chien Tseng, who won the second place in the violin section (in which first place was not awarded) of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 2015. As for conductors, Helen Quach, Wen-pin Chien, Shao-chia Lü, Mei-ann Chen, and Tung-chieh Chuang are all well-known conductors in the international music scene that has brought Taiwan international prestige.

In 1990, composer Shui-long Ma launched the Spring and Autumn Music Collection, a platform for sponsoring aspiring composers, funded and organized by the Chew&#x27;s Culture Foundation. Entrepreneur Andrew Chew supported this endeavor in acknowledgment of the dire need for more Taiwanese composers and the recognition that composers serve as the cornerstone of all artistic works. Theatrical as well as choreographic performances all need background music, with composers playing as vital a role as accompanists. The Spring and Autumn Music Collection launched its first concert in the spring of 1991, presenting the works of aspiring Taiwanese composers in their prime, such as Shu-si Chen, Shan-hua Chien, Kwang-i Ying, Hwei-lee Chang, Ming-chung Sheu, Shyh-ji Pan, and Yann-jong Hwang, with a variety of styles of music represented. The autumn concert held later the same year brought in veteran composers, such as Tsang-houei Hsu, Hwang-long Pan, Yen Lu, Ting-lien Wu, Nan-chang Chien, Shing-kwei Tzeng, and Hao Chang. They produced new works that blend Chinese culture with Western compositional techniques.

The difference between the spring and autumn concerts held by the Spring and Autumn Music Collection is that the spring concerts feature works by aspiring composers, while the autumn concerts focus on works by seasoned composers. As of 2016, the Spring and Autumn Music Collection may not hold concerts every year but the participating composers represent the development of Taiwan&#x27;s Western art music scene. Many of the outstanding composers featured in the concerts have won prizes in the international composition competitions, for example, Jing Peng, Ming-hsiu Yen, Wei-chih Liu, Ching-meio Lin, Chiu-yu Chou, Shih-hui Chen, Yuan-chen Li, Chung-kun Hung, Tzyy-sheng Lee, and others.

As for the development of Western opera in Taiwan, the Taipei Symphony Orchestra (TSO, 1986 – 2003) produced one opera every year under the directorship of Felix Chiu-Sheng Chen. The operas primarily featured local vocalists with only a few internationally renowned vocalists invited to participate. Moreover, the staff in charge of stage production and backstage work was led by Taiwanese stagehands, administrators, and musicians. This system offered opportunities to local vocalists to showcase their talents and other art workers to develop the skills needed for handling the delicate and complicated work that goes into producing an opera.

The Taipei Opera Theater was established by professor and vocalist Dau-hsiong Tseng in 1973. Although not as large as the Taipei Symphony Orchestra in scale, the Taipei Opera Theater has performed many Western operatic masterpieces over the past 50 years. Both the quantity of performances and the production standards are on par with those produced by public orchestras and the theater serves as an important base for nurturing local opera singers and conductors alike. From Tai-li Chu in the past to the more recent Li-chin Huang, Keng Li, I-chiao Shih, Chia-fen Wu, Hanying Iaia Tso, Taiwan on the whole has raised many young and aspiring vocalists active onstage in many international opera houses.

Cloud Gate Dance Theater is also a major driving force in the Taiwanese composition scene. For example, Deh-ho Lai was commissioned by Hwai-min Lin, the founder of Cloud Gate Dancer Theater, to write the music for White Serpent Tale and The Dream of the Red Chamber. Shui-long Ma was also similarly commissioned for Liao Tian-ding. As for theatrical works, Kuei-ju Lin, a composer in her prime who has devoted herself to theatrical music production and is active in theatrical and art music circles, began her career as an undergraduate. After she received her Ph.D. degree in the United States and returned to Taiwan to teach, she collaborated with M.O.V.E. Theatre to design and host Dear John, which became one of five finalists for the twelfth Taishin Arts Award.

== Modern music==

===Pop and rock===

In the mid-1970s a genre of popular music known as Taiwanese campus folk song appeared in the music scene of Taiwan. This music consisted of a fusion of elements from American folk rock and Chinese folk music, and was very popular throughout East Asia. Until the 1987 lifting of martial law, Taiwanese pop fell into two distinct categories. Hokkien pop was sung in a native dialect and was popular among older and working-class listeners; it was strongly influenced by Japanese enka. In contrast, Mandarin pop, due to the assimilation policy of the authoritarian Kuomintang regime (1945–1996) that suppressed Taiwanese languages and culture, appealed to younger listeners. Pan-Asian superstar Teresa Teng was originally from Taiwan and enjoyed immense popularity throughout the Sinophone world and beyond. By the mid-1980s, Taiwan&#x27;s booming Mandarin&#x27;language music industry was the source of around 90% of Mandopop sold in Southeast Asia.

With the resurgence of interest in native cultural identities starting in the late 1980s, a more distinct and modern form of Taiwanese pop formed. In 1989, a group of musicians called the Blacklist Studio released &quot;Song of Madness&quot; on Rock Records. Blending hip hop, rock and other styles, the album focused on the issues concerning everyday, modern people. Building on &quot;Song of Madness&#x27; &quot; success, the following year saw Lin Chiang release &quot;Marching Forward&quot;, which kickstarted what became known as New Taiwanese Song. At the same time, the Hakka Ethnic Movement was also picking up, with many relevant publications. Notably, Sheng-Chih Wu (吳盛智) released his first Hakka album, &quot;Missed&quot;, in 1981, which has inspired many Hakka musicians since. Later on, Min-Heng Tu (涂敏恆) released &quot;True Hakka,&quot; and it is now considered the &quot;national anthem of the Hakka.&quot;

Pop stars of the 1990s included Wu Bai, Chang Chen-yue, Jimmy Lin, Emil Wakin Chau and so on. A-mei, who is renowned for her technically skilled and powerful vocals, is acclaimed to be the pop diva in Mandopop, and pop idols like Show Lo, Jay Chou, A-Mei, Jolin Tsai and girl group S.H.E have now become the most famous and popular singers of Mandopop. For rock and band music, Mayday is said to have pioneered rock music in Taiwan for the generation of youth. For latest generation of pop music in Taiwan, singing reality shows such as One Million Star and Super idol have brought many ordinary people to fame, such as Jam Hsiao, Yoga Lin, Aska Yang, Lala Hsu, William Wei and so on.

The 1990s and early 2000s also saw the emergence of bands and artists of more diverse genres, such as Sodagreen, Deserts Chang, Cheer Chen, who have achieved commercial success and brought the new &quot;indie&quot; era of Taiwanese pop music. Other indie bands include Your Woman Sleep With Others, Labor Exchange Band, Chairman, Sugar Plum Ferry, deca joins, Backquarter, Fire EX, 8mm Sky, Seraphim, and ChthoniC. The annual Formoz Festival, Spring Scream, and Hohaiyan Rock Festival are representative gatherings within Taiwan&#x27;s indie scene. Of these, Formoz Festival is notable for its international draw, with foreign artists such as Yo La Tengo, Moby, Explosions in the Sky, and Caribou headlining the event, while Spring Scream is the largest local band event, and Hohaiyan draws a mixed crowd of beach side party-goers and music appreciators alike.

Other Taiwanese popular singers/bands include Rainie Yang, Da Mouth, Amber Kuo, A-Lin, Magic Power and much more. The popular culture of the Taiwanese people has also influenced Chinese-speaking populations in other places such as Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore.

===Metal===

There are hundreds of metal bands active in Taiwan. Bands such as Chthonic and Seraphim have drawn more attention to the metal scene in Taiwan, with Chthonic in particular attracting attention overseas, performing at European festivals such as Bloodstock Open Air.

===Techno===
Taiwan has a small techno and house music scene center on Taipei. Most DJs and artists do it on the side rather than as their primary job. Performances often mix music with visual art.

<text>The Palais de Justice (; &#x27;&quot;Palace of Justice&quot;), is a judicial center and courthouse in Paris, located on the Île de la Cité. It contains the Court of Appeal of Paris, the busiest appellate court in France, and France&#x27;s highest court for ordinary cases, the Court of Cassation. It formerly housed the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris which was relocated in 2018 to a new high-rise building in Paris&#x27;s Batignolles neighborhood. The Palais de Justice occupies a large part of the medieval Palais de la Cité, the former royal palace of the kings of France, which also includes Sainte Chapelle, the royal chapel, and the Conciergerie, a notorious former prison, which operated from 1380 to 1914. It is located in close proximity to the Tribunal of Commerce, the Prefecture of Police of Paris, and the offices of the Paris Bar Association.

== History ==
===Royal Courtroom to Revolutionary courtroom===

Under King Robert II of France the Palais de la Cité began to serve as the home of a high court or council for the King. He constructed the Hall of the King, where the Curia Regis, or King&#x27;s Council met. This was replaced by a much larger hall, the Grand Chamber, under Philip IV (1268-34). This enormous hall began to be used for theatrical performances, the meetings of the Parlement of Paris, a judicial body composed of the high French nobility.

In 1358, a Paris uprising led by the merchant Etienne Marcel caused the future king, Charles V of France, to depart Paris for safer quarters farther from the center of Paris; first at the Hôtel Saint-Pol, then near the Bastille, then the Louvre Castle. The judicial function, however, remained at the old palace. The Parlement of Paris, meeting in the Grand Chamber, was an appeals court for royal tribunals and the court of first instance in cases involving the nobility. Furthermore, its approval was required for royal ordinances. This gave it growing power in the feuds between the monarchy and the nobility. Louis XV attended his first court session there in 1715 at age five. The other judicial offices that remained were the Chambre des comptes and the Chancellery.

The very decorative gilded wrought iron grillwork and gateway were put in place in 1776. The façade and principal entrance of the palace, facing the Court of May, was entirely rebuilt between 1783 and 1786 with a neo-classical colonnade.

During the French Revolution, the Grand Chamber, where the Parlement of Paris had met, became the courtroom of the Revolutionary Tribunal, which rapidly tried and sentenced those accused of opposing the Revolution. Those convicted were usually taken to the guillotine the same day. In 718 days, up until 31 May 1795, the Tribunal sent 2,780 persons to the guillotine. Among the last to be executed was the Chief Prosecutor, Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, bringing the Reign of Terror to a close.
=== A new Palace of Justice (19th century)===
In the first half of the 19th century, the palace became entirely devoted to the justice system. Under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Restoration and the July Monarchy, various projects were put forward for a new and larger structure. Between 1820 and 1828, the architect Antoine-Marie Peyre built a new façade between tower of the Horloge and the Tower of Bombec, and the access to the Conciergerie was moved to the Quai de Bombec.

Between 1837 and 1840, a new project for the building was developed by the architect Jean-Nicolas Huyot. Unlike most of the proposed structures, which were in the neo-classical style, with columns and pediments, Huyot&#x27;s plan was neo-Renaissance. Unfortunately, on August 3, 1840, after all the final approvals had been received, Huyot died. Two weeks later the architects Joseph-Louis Duc and Etienne-Theodore Dommey were selected to build the structure. Construction took place between 1847 and 1871. The project included a new façade on the Boulevard de Paris, the restoration of the other buildings within the old palace, and a new building for the Cour de Cassation.

In March 1871, as the building was nearing completion, the Paris Commune seized power in the city. Work was abruptly halted. Then, in May, 1871, as the French army moved to take back the city from the Communards in what became known as the Semaine Sanglante (&quot;Bloody Week”), arsonists from the Commune, rapidly losing ground to the French Army, set fire to the interior of the new building, almost entirely destroying it.

Shortly after 1871, the reconstruction resumed, under Duc and Honoré Daumet, and continued for more than twenty years. Duc completed the façade of Harlay, while Daumet rebuilt the Cour of Appeals. The work was finished by Albert Tournaire with the completion of the Tribunal correctionnel at the southeast corner, on the quai des Orfevres. The Conciergerie, beneath the palace, was opened to the public in 1914, and all prison functions in the building stopped in 1934.
=== War Crimes, departures and transformation (20th-21st century) ===
In October 1945, after the end of World War II, the Palais of Justice courtrooms were used to try the highest French officials who had collaborated with the Nazi occupation. Those put on trial included the former prime minister Pierre Laval and Marshal Philippe Pétain. Laval was found guilty and was executed in October 1945 by a firing squad. Petain was also found guilty and sentenced to death, but due to his age and past service his sentence was reduced to imprisonment and then transfer to a hospital. He died at the age of 95 on July 23, 1951.

By the 21st century, the Palace of Justice had become too small for some of its functions. In 2018, the Tribunal judiciaire de Paris, the court formerly known as the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris, was moved to a modern high-rise tower, the Tribunal de Paris, by architect Renzo Piano at Batignolles, in the 17th arrondissement. The Tribunal d&#x27;instance petit (court of first instance) also moved to the new Tribunal de Paris effective January 1, 2020.
== The Palace of Justice today ==

Some historic parts of the Palace were opened to the public in 1914, and in 1934 the prison of the Conciergerie was definitely closed. The lower portion of the Conciergerie became an historical heritage site, while the upper levels continued to be occupied by judicial offices.

The formal entrance to the Palais de Justice is through the Cour de Mai, or &quot;May Courtyard&quot;. The lace-ike gilded iron gateway was part of the 19th century reconstruction. Inside, most of the space is occupied by the courtrooms, legal offices, and support functions, including a large law library. Together these occupy about 4500 square meters of the building. Each day the Palais receives about thirteen thousand persons.

The Cour de Cassation is one of the four courts of last resort in France. It has jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters triable in the judicial system, and is the supreme court of appeal in these cases. It has jurisdiction to review the law, and to certify questions of law, to determine miscarriages of justice.

Though the old Conciergerie prison was closed, the Palace still has three detention facilities. The &quot;Depot&quot;, under the control of the Paris Police Prefecture, for those prisoners in &quot;Garde à vue&quot;, who most report regularly to the police. About eighty such individuals come to the Depot each day. The second is the &quot;Souricière&quot;, a holding area for prisoners before they are taken to a hearing before a judge. This part of the building, under the control of the prison administration, has about seventy-five cells. Finally there is the center for administrative detention, for detaining persons with an irregular legal status.

<text>The Île de la Cité (; English: City Island, &quot;Island of the City&quot;),is in size, is one of the two natural islands in the Seine River (alongside, Île Saint-Louis) in central Paris. In the 4th century, it was the site of the fortress of the area governor for the Roman Empire. In 508, Clovis I, the first King of the Franks, established his palace on the island. In the 12th century, it extended its importance as a religious centre, the home of Notre-Dame cathedral, and the castle chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, as well as the city hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu (possibly the oldest continuously operating hospital in the world). It is also the site of the city&#x27;s oldest surviving bridge, the Pont Neuf.

Even with the departure of the French kings to the Louvre Palace across the right bank, and then to the Palace of Versailles, the island remained a centre of administration and law courts. In 1302, it hosted the first meeting of the Parlement of Paris in the old royal palace and was later the site of the trials of aristocrats during the French Revolution. Today, in addition to the prominent cathedral and other shrines, it is the home of the Préfecture de Police, the Palais de Justice, and the Tribunal de commerce de Paris. The Mémorial des Martyrs de la Déportation, a memorial to the 200,000 people deported from Vichy France to Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War, is located at the eastern end of the island. As of 2016, the island&#x27;s population was 891.

==History==
===Early history===
A Gallic settlement, called Lutetia, may have existed on the island since at least the 3rd century BC. The nearby area was inhabited by the Parisii, a small Gallic tribe. The island may have served them as a convenient place to cross the Seine, a base for a flourishing trading network by river, and a place of refuge in times of invasion. However, no significant traces of a settlement earlier than the 1st century AD have been found to date on the island.

The Parisii were famous traders, taking advantage of the trade routes by river throughout Europe. Coins minted by the Parisii, dating to about 100 BC, have been found in excavations across France and other parts of Europe. The island was the most convenient river crossing point, with bridges on both sides of the island. 

The first recorded mention of the island is in the &quot;Commentaries&quot; of Julius Caesar. In 53 BC, during the conquest of Gaul, Caesar came to Lutetia and met with the leaders of the Gallic tribes. They agreed to submit to Rome, but then almost immediately rebelled. Caesar sent one of his generals, Titus Labienus, to subdue the Parisii. The Parisii burned the bridges to prevent his passage, but they were outmaneuvered and defeated in battle on the Plain of Auteuil.

An academic debate about the original location of Lutetia began in 2006, following the excavation in 1994–2005 of a large Gallic necropolis, with residences and temples, at Nanterre, along the Seine in the Paris suburbs. Some historians have put forward this settlement at Nanterre as the Lutetia of the Gauls, rather than Île de la Cité. Other historians point out that Caesar described &quot;Lutetia, fortress (&#x27;oppidum&#x27;) of the Parisii, situated on an island.&quot; They say that the absence of traces of pre-Roman settlement discovered so far on Île de la Cité is due primarily to the continuous building and rebuilding on the island over the centuries.

After the conquest of the Parisii, the Roman town of Lutetia developed mainly on the Left Bank, where the temples and baths were located. However, in the 3rd century AD, a series of invasions by Germanic tribes began; the Roman town on the left bank was sacked in 275–76. Afterwards, the left bank was largely abandoned. Beginning in 307 AD, the forum, amphitheater, and other structures were demolished and the stone was used to construct a rampart around the island, as well as to construct new buildings. The stone wall was not very high - only about two meters - but was apparently topped by a further wooden palisade. The island became an important defensive position on the northern flank of the Roman Empire. In 451, during the late Roman Empire, when the Huns occupied the left bank, Saint Genevieve led the defence of the city from the island.
The Roman Emperor Julian, residing in Gaul from 355 to 361, described &quot;a small island lying in the river; a wall entirely surrounds it, and wooden bridges lead to it on both sides.&quot; At what was then the western end of the island was the residence of the Roman governor, near the present Palais de Justice. It was described as a &quot;Palace&quot;, but appears to have been a very modest residence.

The Roman also built a new wharf, where the Parvis Notre-Dame – Place Jean-Paul II is today. The island was much smaller then; the Roman wharf is now well inland, far from the present edge of the island. Remains of the wharf can be seen in the archeological crypt under the Parvis, in front of Notre-Dame de Paris. One important monument left by the Parisii was discovered here: the Pillar of the Boatmen, a group of statues erected by the boatmen of the city in the 1st century AD, honouring both Roman and Gallic gods.

In addition to the residence of the Roman governor, the island contained the civic basilica, which held the courts of justice. It was located near the present flower market and Metro station, and was a large rectangular building 70 by 35 meters in size, with a central nave and two collateral aisles. Its foundations were discovered during the construction of the Metro station in 1906. It, too, was built with stones taken from the forum on the Left Bank.

In 486, Saint Genevieve negotiated the submission of Paris to Clovis I, the first King of the Franks, who chose Paris as his capital, in 508. The first cathedral of Paris, that of Saint Étienne, was constructed in 540–545, close to the west front of the present Notre Dame de Paris and just a few hundred meters from the Royal Palace.

Hugh Capet (c. 941–996), the founder of the Capetian dynasty, began as ruler of a kingdom not much larger than the Paris region, but through conquest and marriage, he and his descendants made the Kingdom of France into an important European power. The visible symbol of Capetian power was the Palais de la Cité, which he and his descendants enlarged and embellished. Philippe IV built the Grand Chamber and new walls, with two towers: the Tower of Caesar and the Tower of Silver. Louis VI (1081–1137) tore down the old tower and built an even larger one, which remained until the 18th century.

=== 12th–17th century ===
Louis IX built his new chapel, the jewel-like Sainte-Chapelle, between 1242 and 1248. During the same period, the most famous landmark of the island was constructed: the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. An earlier cathedral, the Cathedral of Saint-Étienne, had been constructed in the Romanesque style. In 1160, the bishop of Paris, Maurice de Sully, began construction of a cathedral in the new Gothic style, to match the magnificence of the palace. The first stones of the foundation of the new cathedral were laid by Pope Alexander III, in 1163. Its construction spanned two centuries.

During this period, new streets and houses were constructed on the island, which became more and more densely populated. The crowding of the island, and the resulting problems of narrow streets jammed with traffic, pollution, and foul smells, caused the Kings of France to search for a new residence. A rebellion of the Parisians in 1358, led by Étienne Marcel, the provost of the merchants, at a time when the French King was a hostage of the English, caused the next King, Charles V of France, to move his residence to the edge of the city: first to the Hôtel Saint-Pol, then to the Bastille, and finally to the Louvre Palace.

In the following centuries, after the Kings departed, the island retained its importance as an administrative centre. It was home to the courts and tribunals, as well as the Parlement of Paris: an assembly of nobles who formally registered royal proclamations. It included the Conciergerie, which contained the royal prisons and judicial offices. Other important transformations were made to the island. In 1585, work began on the Pont Neuf at the far west end of the island. In 1607, Henry IV gave up the royal garden on the island, which was transformed into the Place Dauphine, and the Pont Neuf was completed.

When the Pont Neuf was built, two small islands, Île à la Gourdaine and Île aux Juifs, which were just to the west of the island, were joined to it. The Ilot des Juifs had been the site of the burning at the stake of Jacques de Molay, the leader of the Knights Templar, in 1314, as the island was just below the towers of the Royal Palace. The junction of the small islands was completed in 1607, and the land was developed into the Place Dauphine and the Square du Vert-Galant.

Henry IV began the practice of selling lots on the island for private townhouses, particularly the development of the Place Dauphine at the east end of the island. In the same century, Louis XIII made a major improvement to the island by building stone river banks to contain the river. This did not prevent a major flood of the Seine in 1689–90, which ruined the lower stained glass windows of the Sainte-Chapelle.

===18th century===

In the 18th century, the Conciergerie on the island became the scene of some of the most dramatic events of the French Revolution. In 1788, the Constituent Assembly, meeting in the former royal palace, refused the demands of Louis XVI to turn over some of its members. In 1790, Jean Sylvain Baily, the mayor of Paris, sealed the doors of the royal palace. In August 1793, Queen Marie-Antoinette was taken to the Conciergerie, where she was imprisoned. After two and a half months she was tried, convicted, and sentenced to the guillotine. In September 1793, the radical Sans-Culottes stormed the Conciergerie and massacred the remaining royalist prisoners. On 27 July 1795, it was the turn of the revolutionary leader Robespierre to be arrested, brought to the Conciergerie, tried, and sent to the guillotine.

Notre-Dame de Paris also suffered during the French Revolution; it was closed and then turned into a Temple of Reason; much of the sculpture – particularly in the portals on the west front – was defaced or destroyed. The neighbouring Hôtel-Dieu hospital sounded too religious for the secular revolutionaries, so its name was changed to the &quot;House of Humanity&quot;. Restoration of the revolutionary damage did not begin until the 1830s, particularly following the success of Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;.

===19th–20th century===
In the early 19th century, with the restoration of the monarchy, the old palace was substantially rebuilt for its function as the centre of the judicial system. An expiatory chapel was built where the cell of Marie-Antoinette had been. Between 1820 and 1828, the façade between the Tower of the Horloge and the Tower of Bonbec was rebuilt. It remained a prison; the future Napoleon III was imprisoned there for a time following a failed attempt to overthrow the government.

In the mid-19th century, the island was overcrowded, with narrow streets and poor sanitation. It was hard hit by major cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1849, which killed thousands of Parisians. The new President, and then Emperor, Napoleon III, ordered the demolition of the old streets and buildings and the opening of wide avenues and squares. The Parvis in front of the cathedral was greatly increased in size. In 1867, Napoleon III also demolished the overcrowded medieval hospital, the Hôtel-Dieu, and replaced it with the present building.

The mid-19th century brought a new campaign of rebuilding and restoration. Between 1837 and 1863, the Saint Chapelle - which had been turned into a storehouse for legal documents - was restored to its medieval splendor. The façade of the Palace of Justice was entirely rebuilt between 1847 and 1871. The medieval hall and the Bonbec Tower were restored to their original appearance.

The Paris Commune of 1871 brought a brief wave of destruction. In the final days of the Commune, the Communards set fire to the Palace of Justice, and attempted to burn down Notre-Dame de Paris. A large part of the Palace of Justice was destroyed, but Notre-Dame was saved by the cathedral staff, suffering only minimal damage. Between 1904 and 1914, the Palace of Justice was finally completed. The Conciergerie had been declared an historic monument in 1862. It was opened to the public in 1914, and the remaining prison sections were closed in 1934.

== Description ==
=== Square de l&#x27;Île de la Cité and Memorial to the Martyrs of the Deportation ===

The Place de l&#x27;Île de la Cité is a small park located at the extreme eastern tip of the island, behind the cathedral. It originally was a separate island, called La Motte-aux-Papelards, made up in part of debris from the construction of the cathedral. In 1864, Baron Haussmann chose it as the new site for the Paris morgue, which remained there for fifty years.

Next to the square is the Memorial to the Martyrs of the Deportation, a memorial to the two hundred thousand people who were sent to Nazi concentration camps during World War II. It was dedicated in 1962 by then-President Charles de Gaulle. The monument is at a lower level than the park, reached by a narrow stairway. It is extremely stark and simple, composed of a triangular courtyard giving access to a crypt and corridor. The walls of the crypt are inscribed with the names of concentration camps and with quotations by writers; the corridor is lined with two hundred thousand small glass crystals, each representing a victim of the deportations.

=== The Cathedral and Parvis of Notre-Dame ===
The Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris is among the most visible and celebrated landmarks of Paris. Construction began in 1163, next to the older Romanesque Cathedral of Saint-Étienne, and was largely completed by 1345. It is among the largest Gothic cathedrals in Europe, with a seating capacity of six-and-a-half thousand. The flèche, or Spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, originally built in 1220–1230, was removed in the 17th century, then rebuilt by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in the mid-19th century. At high, it was the tallest structure in Paris until the construction of the Eiffel Tower. The spire and much of the roof were destroyed by the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on 15 April 2019 and the cathedral has been closed for restoration ever since. It re-opened on 7 December 2024.

The parvis or square in front of the cathedral – now officially known as Place Jean-Paul-II – is long and wide, six times larger than the original medieval square. The area in front of the church was packed with narrow houses and streets until Paris was rebuilt in a more expansive style by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann in the mid-19th century.

Excavations for a car park under the square in 1965 uncovered vestiges of the original Gallo-Roman walls of the city and the Roman baths, dating to the 4th century. They are now open to the public.

A plaque on the parvis thirty meters in front of the central portal marks the point from which distances by road to other cities in France are measured. This same area, in medieval times, was the location of the stocks, where notorious prisoners were displayed in chains.

The statue of Emperor Charlemagne on horseback, by the river in front of the cathedral, is the largest monument on the Parvis. The bronze sculpture was made in 1878 by the brothers Louis and Charles Rochet in the romantic style. The legendary knights Roland and Olivier are portrayed walking alongside the emperor.

=== Place Louis-Lepine, the Flower Market and the Tribunal of Commerce ===
A large square – Place Louis-Lepine – is located in the centre of the island, in front of the Prefecture of Police. It hosts a famous flower market, which was created by an ordinance of Napoleon in January 1808. It occupies the space between Place-Louis Lepine and the Seine. In 2016 the market was renamed the Marché aux fleurs Reine-Elizabeth-II, during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Paris. On Sundays, it also becomes a large market for live birds and other pets. The square is the location of the only metro station on the island, with an Art Nouveau portal designed by Hector Guimard. The metro station is unusually deep — underground — because the tunnel carrying the trains must pass underneath the River Seine.

The Prefecture of Police was built under Napoleon III as a barracks of the Republican Guard. It was gradually expanded into a police headquarters with authority over the twenty districts of Paris and the departments surrounding Paris. During the liberation of Paris in August 1944, the building was the scene of fierce fighting. When the French police went on strike, the occupying German forces attacked the building with tanks. One hundred and sixty-seven policemen were killed.

Alongside the Quai de la Corse, at the Pont au Change, is the Tribunal de commerce de Paris, which contains the courts of business and commerce. The judges of this court are not lawyers, but business people elected for 2–4 year terms. The building was constructed between 1860 and 1865 in the extremely ornate Louis XIII style – like the Palais Garnier opera house, built at about the same time. Its dome was inspired by the New Cathedral, Brescia in Italy, begun in 1604 but not finished until 1825. Napoleon III had admired it in 1859 during his military campaign which liberated Italy from Austrian rule.

=== The Hôtel-Dieu ===
The Hôtel-Dieu, located between the Parvis of Notre-Dame on the south and the Quai de la Corse on the north, is the oldest hospital in Paris. It is reputed to be the oldest still-functioning hospital in the world. Tradition says it was founded in 651 by Saint Landry, Bishop of Paris. It was originally located on the other side of the Parvis, along the river, with a second building on the left Bank of the Seine. The old hospital was famous for its overcrowding, with several patients in each bed. It was rebuilt several times. During the French Revolution it was re-named the &quot;House of Humanity&quot;, in keeping with the secular principles of the revolution. The present hospital was begun by Napoleon III in 1863 and completed in 1877. The design, in an Italian Renaissance style, was by the architect Arthur-Stanislas Diet. It has several buildings, connected by porticos. Until 1908, care in the hospital was provided by nuns; now it is part of the network of Paris public hospitals.

Historical buildings close to the same site included the Hospice of Found Children, built in 1670, where new-born babies could be abandoned without explanation at any hour of the day or night. It received up to eight thousand children a year before the French Revolution.

=== The Canons&#x27; Quarter ===

Most of the very old residential quarters on the island were destroyed by Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann in the 19th century. Only one small area remains: the Canons&#x27; Quarter (Quartier des Chainoines), located between the Quai aux Fleurs, the rue d&#x27;Arcole and the rue du Cloitre-Notre Dame. In the 16th century it was the residence of many of the canons of the cathedral. It was closed to the outside world by gates, no commerce was permitted, and no women were allowed except those of &quot;respectable age&quot;. Several residences remain from this period; the house at 24 rue Chanoinesse, from about 1512, has large doors leading to an interior courtyard and dormer windows jutting up from the roof. It is now covered with wisteria. Another good example is found at 12 Rue Chanoinesse.

One celebrated inhabitant of the neighborhood was the playwright Jean Racine, who lived on the second floor in the courtyard of the house at 7 rue des Ursines between 1672 and 1677. Another famous resident was Héloïse, the daughter of a canon named Fulbert, who lived at 9 Quai aux Fleurs. She was seduced by her philosophy teacher, Peter Abelard, in 1418. In what became one of the most celebrated romantic tragedies in French history, she secretly married Abelard; her furious father had him arrested and castrated. Both Abelard and Heloise finished their lives living in monasteries. The original house of Héloïse was demolished in 1849, but the present house has a plaque commemorating its role in the tragic story.

=== Quai de l&#x27;Horloge and the Palace of Justice ===
The old royal palace lay along the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge, on the northeast side of the island. With the departure of the kings of France to the Louvre and then to Versailles, the palace gradually was transformed into the judicial centre of the Kingdom, containing the courts, administrative offices and a prison.

The Quai de l&#x27;Horloge takes its name from the clock in the tower on the northeastern corner of the palace. The tower was built between 1350 and 1353 as a watchtower. When it was constructed, it was directly on the Seine. The stone walls of the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge, built beginning in 1611, created space for a road. The first clock was ordered by Charles V, and faced the interior of the palace. In 1418 it was given an outside face, toward the city, and became the first municipal clock of Paris. In the 16th century, Henry III had the clock redecorated with sculpture by the French Renaissance sculptor Germain Pilon. The tower was originally topped by a silver bell, rung only to announce he death of the king or the birth of his heir. It was also rung on 24 August 1572, at the beginning of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, to signal the beginning of the attack on the Protestants of Paris. The original bell was melted down during the French Revolution, but was replaced in 1848. The gilding of the clock was restored in 2012.

During the French Revolution, the attic on the top floor between the Silver Tower and Bonbec Tower was the home of Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, the chief prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal. He lived there with his wife and twins while conducting the trials in the lower courtroom which sent more than two thousand prisoners to the guillotine.

Most of the facade along the Seine on the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge was rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style in the 19th century. The exceptions are the three towers that follow the tower of the Horloge, which date to about 1300, in the reign of Philip IV. The Tower of Caesar and the Silver Tower flank the gateway. The Tower of Caesar was built on a Gallo-Roman foundation, while the Silver Tower served as the royal treasury. The third and oldest tower - the only one with tooth-like crenellations around the top - is the Tower Bonbec. It was built by Louis IX, at the same time as the Sainte-Chapelle. Beginning in the 15th century it contained the torture chamber of the palace. For this reason its name was reputed to come from the expression &quot;Bon Bec&quot;, or &quot;To quickly untie the tongue&quot;.

The parts of the palace further west were constructed under Napoleon III in the neo-classical style, with Corinthian pillars. The buildings were gradually taken over entirely by the judicial function. They now house the highest court in France: the Court of Appeals, created in 1790. The various buildings of the Palais de Justice cover about a third of the island, and at their peak employed about four thousand employees. They are still occupied largely by the courts and offices of the justice system, though some functions have moved to a new building on the outskirts of Paris.

The main entrance is located on the Boulevard du Palais, behind a very elaborate wrought-iron gate. The main entrance dates to 1783–87, and features a grand staircase and classical peristyle. Until the 1840s, the entry courtyard was also occupied by the stalls of merchants, making it extremely lively.

The older portion of the building, the Conciergerie, was turned into a state prison from about 1370, as the Kings moved out to live elsewhere. The original entrance to the building was on what is now the first floor, since the street level was gradually raised. Within the entrance is a very large Gothic hall, with four naves divided by rows massive pillars, which was originally known as the Hall of the Men-at-Arms. It was used primarily as a dining hall for the two thousand employees in the King&#x27;s service. Four stairways originally reached upward to the grand ceremonial hall on the first floor, where the Parliament met and court festivities were held. Most of this floor was destroyed by fire in 1618, but some vestiges remain, including pieces of the enormous black marble table that was a centrepiece of the hall. They now hang on the south wall of the lower chamber.
The residence of the king originally adjoined this part of the Palace, but its last remains were destroyed in the fires set by the Paris Commune in 1871. All that remains of his residence is the Guards&#x27; Hall: originally, an antechamber to the residence. From the west side of the back wall runs a passage known as the &quot;Rue de Paris&quot;; it was used by the royal executioner, nicknamed &quot;Monsieur de Paris&quot;.

A few portions of the old prison, which was in use from 1370 to 1914, still exist. The Revolutionary Tribunal was established on the first floor of the Palace of Justice from September 1793 until the fall of Robespierre in 1794. The prisoners were crowded into common cells, and were not told of the specific charge against them until the day before the trial. The public prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville, prepared execution sentences in advance with the names left blank - to speed the court procedure. After very rapid trials with little opportunity for defence, the tribune sent thousands of prisoners to the guillotine. Convicted prisoners were usually executed the day after their trial. They had their necks shaved and their collars widened, and were taken in cartloads of ten or twelve prisoners to the Place de la Revolution (today&#x27;s Place de la Concorde) for execution. In all, two thousand, seven hundred and eighty people were convicted and executed in this manner. Reconstructions of some of the cells can be seen today.

The best-known victim of this process was Queen Marie-Antoinette, who was held at the Conciergerie for seventy-six days: from 2 August until 16 October 1793. She was confined to a small cell where she was watched day and night by two guards until her trial. The following day, she was taken on a cart to her execution, along a street lined with thirty thousand soldiers and crowds of jeering Parisians. After the Restoration of the monarchy, in 1816, her original cell was transformed into a chapel. Another cell nearby, very similar to her original cell, gives visitors an idea of her final days.

=== The Sainte-Chapelle ===

The Sainte-Chapelle was the royal chapel, located in the courtyard of the palace. It was created by Louis IX (later Saint Louis) to display sacred relics of the Crucifixion; particularly the Crown of Thorns that he purchased in 1239 from the Emperor of Constantinople. He later added what was believed to be a fragment of the true cross. Work was already underway by 1241, and it was consecrated in 1248.

The Sainte-Chapelle measured high – not counting the spire – which ranked it with the major cathedrals of the time. By comparison, the nave of Notre-Dame de Paris is high. The current spire is high, but it is not original. In fact, it is the fifth spire to adorn the Sainte-Chapelle. It was made in 1852–53, following the model of the 15th-century spire. The 19th-century sculpture, inspired by medieval models, was cast in lead by Geoffrey-Dechaume.

The great treasure of The Sainte-Chapelle is the 13th century stained glass windows; the glass was thicker than later windows, and consequently the colors were deeper and richer, with reds and blues predominant. There are more than thirteen hundred small panels of stained glass, each containing a biblical scene. More than two-thirds of the original stained glass survived, including fifteen Early Gothic windows from the 13th century and the later Gothic rose window from the 15th century. The upper portion of the chapel, where the relics were displayed, was reserved for the royal family, while the ground floor was used by the courtiers and servants of the court.

The chapel suffered major damage during the French Revolution. Afterwards, it was turned into a storehouse of documents for the neighbouring Ministry of Justice.

=== Quai des Orfèvres ===

The Quai des Orfèvres, &quot;The Quay of the Goldmsiths and Silversmiths&quot;, is on the southwestern side of the island, alongside the Palace of Justice and the Place Dauphine. In its earlier days, a poultry market was held here; as a result policemen were referred to by the slang term &quot;poulets&quot; or &quot;chickens&quot;. Its current name dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, when many celebrated Paris jewellers had their shops here; including Boehmer and Bassenge - who made a famous necklace for Marie-Antoinette - and Georg Friedrich Strass, who invented both the rhinestone and the synthetic diamond.

The jewellers&#x27; shops have since disappeared, but the street is notable for the imposing office building at 36 Quai de Orfèvres. Constructed between 1875 et 1880 by architects Émile Jacques Gilbert and Arthur-Stanislas Diet, it replaced an earlier building of the President of the Court of Appeals of Paris, which was destroyed by the Paris Commune in 1871. As the home of the &quot;Direction régionale de la police judiciaire de la préfecture de police de Paris&quot; (Directorate of the Judicial Police of the Paris Prefecture), its address featured in the titles of several very popular French films and detective novels. The fictional detective Inspector Jules Maigret, created by Georges Simenon, had his office here. The police moved out, to the rue Bastion in the 17th Arrondissement, in 2017.

=== The Rue de Harlay and the Cour de Cassation of the Palais de Justice ===
Rue de Harlay runs across the island on the northwest side, separating the Palais de Justice from the Place Dauphine. It is named for Achille de Harlay, the first president of the Parlement of Paris in the early 17th century; his house stood in that location until it was demolished for the enlargement of the Palace of Justice. The building of the Cour de Cassation, a kind of French Supreme Court, looks over the Place Dauphine. Its highly theatrical facade was designed by Joseph-Louis Duc, whose other famous Paris work is the July Column in the Place de la Bastille. It features marble classical columns, pediments and bas-reliefs; there are sculpted lions on the grand stairways, eagles on the roof and statues of famous jurists in togas along the facade. Like the Paris Opera of the same period, it is in the style of Napoleon III. It was nearly completed in 1871 when Napoleon III was deposed. The Paris Commune set fire to the unfinished palace, partially destroying it; but it was later restored and completed.

One famous feature is the Hall of the &quot;Pas Perdus&quot;, or &quot;Last steps&quot;, where prisoners would be taken between the courtrooms and the prison.

===Place Dauphine===

The triangular Place Dauphine, at the downstream end of the island, was originally the garden of the royal palace. Known as &quot;The King&#x27;s Orchard&quot;, it was filled with vegetable gardens, fruit trees and flower beds. Beginning in 1609 King Henry IV turned it into a residential square, facing the palace, similar to the square he began at the Place des Vosges a few years earlier. It was named for his son, the Dauphin of France (the future Louis XIII). He asked the president of the Parliament, to develop it. Twelve lots were sold, and forty-five irregularly sized houses were constructed behind a standardised façade. The houses were built of brick, with limestone quoins supported on arcaded stone ground floors and capped by steep slate roofs with dormers - similar to the façades of Place des Vosges. Each house had a ground floor of arcades occupied by shops; two floors of living space; and an attic with skylights.

There were originally two entrances to the Place Dauphine. One was at the downstream end, entering through a kind of gateway centred on paired pavilions facing the equestrian statue of Henry IV on the far side of the Pont Neuf. The second was in the centre of the eastern row of houses, which were badly damaged during the Paris Commune of 1871. Nearly all the buildings have been raised in height, given new façades, or replaced with modified versions of the originals. Notable residents of the Place included the film stars Yves Montand and Simone Signoret, who occupied 15 Place Dauphin - above a bookstore - from their wedding in 1952 until the death of Signoret in 1985.
=== The Pont Neuf and the Square du Vert Galant ===
The Pont Neuf, completed in 1606, was the first bridge in Paris to cross the entire length of the Seine, and the first that was not lined with houses. It was the project of Henry IV. After the assassination of the king in 1610, it became the site of another innovation: the first equestrian statue in Paris. Commissioned in 1614 by Marie de&#x27; Medici - the widow and regent of the king - it was modelled after the equestrian statues of her native Italy. Giambologna completed the commission in 1618. The statue was destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, but was replaced in 1817 by the royal sculptor François Lemot, using casts of the original.

At the time that the statue was installed on the bridge, it stood at the very tip of island. In 1884 the end of the island was extended over a sandbar with the construction of new quays, and planted with trees. This became the new Square of Vert-Galant. Its name comes from the king&#x27;s nickname as an admirer of women. The triangular park has some of the finest views of the buildings along both sides of the Seine.

=== Bridges ===

From early times wooden bridges linked the island to the riverbanks on either side. The Grand Pont (or Pont au Change) spanned the wider reach to the Right Bank, while the Petit Pont crossed the narrower channel to the Left Bank. The first stone bridge was built in 1378 at the site of the present Pont Saint-Michel; but ice floes carried it away, along with all the houses on it, 1408. The Grand Pont or Pont Notre-Dame - also swept away at intervals by floodwaters - and the Petit Pont were rebuilt by Fra Giovanni Giocondo at the beginning of the 16th century.
The six arches of the Pont Notre-Dame supported gabled houses, some of half-timbered construction, until all were demolished in 1786.

Currently eight bridges connect the island with the rest of Paris.

* The Pont Neuf, begun by Henry IV and completed in 1607, is the oldest still in its original form, and the only one that goes from the right bank to the left bank
* The Pont au Change, from the Place du Châtelet on the right bank to the Quai de l&#x27;Horloge and the Palais de Justice
* The Pont Notre-Dame, across the centre of the island
* The Pont d&#x27;Arcole, from the Hôtel de Ville to the Hôtel-Dieu and Notre-Dame de Paris
* The Pont Saint-Louis, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Île Saint-Louis
* The Pont de l&#x27;Archevêché, from the southeast end of the island to the Quai de Montebello on the Left Bank
* The Pont au Double, from the Quai de Montebello on Left Bank to the front of Notre-Dame de Paris
* The Pont Saint-Michel, from Place Saint-Michel across the centre of the island to Châtelet

==Transport==
The island has one Paris Métro station: Cité. There is also one RER station: Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame, although on the Left Bank, has an exit on the island in front of the cathedral.

<text>An air-to-air missile (AAM) is a missile fired from an aircraft for the purpose of destroying another aircraft (including unmanned aircraft such as cruise missiles). AAMs are typically powered by one or more rocket motors, usually solid fueled but sometimes liquid fueled. Ramjet engines, as used on the Meteor, are emerging as propulsion that will enable future medium- to long-range missiles to maintain higher average speed across their engagement envelope.

Air-to-air missiles are broadly put in two groups. Those designed to engage opposing aircraft at ranges of around 30 km to 40 km maximum are known as short-range or &quot;within visual range&quot; missiles (SRAAMs or WVRAAMs) and are sometimes called &quot;dogfight&quot; missiles because they are designed to optimize their agility rather than range. Most use infrared guidance and are called heat-seeking missiles. In contrast, medium- or long-range missiles (MRAAMs or LRAAMs), which both fall under the category of beyond-visual-range missiles (BVRAAMs), tend to rely upon radar guidance, of which there are many forms. Some modern ones use inertial guidance and/or &quot;mid-course updates&quot; to get the missile close enough to use an active homing sensor. The concepts of air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles are closely related, and in some cases versions of the same weapon may be used for both roles, such as the ASRAAM and Sea Ceptor.

==History==

The air-to-air missile grew out of the unguided air-to-air rockets used during the First World War. Le Prieur rockets were sometimes attached to the struts of biplanes and fired electrically, usually against observation balloons, by such early pilots as Albert Ball and A. M. Walters. Facing the Allied air superiority, Germany in World War II invested limited effort into missile research, initially adapting the projectile of the unguided 21 cm Nebelwerfer 42 infantry barrage rocket system into the air-launched BR 21 anti-aircraft rocket in 1943; leading to the deployment of the R4M unguided rocket and the development of various guided missile prototypes such as the Ruhrstahl X-4.

The US Navy and US Air Force began equipping guided missiles in 1956, deploying the USAF&#x27;s AIM-4 Falcon and the USN&#x27;s AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder. Post-war research led the Royal Air Force to introduce Fairey Fireflash into service in 1957 but their results were unsuccessful. The Soviet Air Force introduced its K-5 into service in 1957. As missile systems have continued to advance, modern air warfare consists almost entirely of missile firing. The use of beyond-visual-range combat became so pervasive in the US that early F-4 variants were armed only with missiles in the 1960s. High casualty rates during the Vietnam War caused the US to reintroduce autocannon and traditional dogfighting tactics but the missile remains the primary weapon in air combat.

In the Falklands War British Harriers, using AIM-9L missiles were able to defeat faster Argentinian opponents. Since the late 20th century all-aspect heat-seeking designs can lock-on to a target from various angles, not just from behind, where the heat signature from the engines is strongest. Other types rely on radar guidance (either on-board or &quot;painted&quot; by the launching aircraft).

===Use of air-to-air missiles as surface-to-air missiles===
In 1999 R-73 missile were adapted by Serb forces for surface to air missiles. The Houthi movement Missile Research and Development Centre and the Missile Force have tried to fire R-27/R-60/R-73/R-77 against Saudi aircraft. Using stockpiles of missiles from Yemeni Air Force stocks. The issue for the R-27 and R-77 is the lack of a radar to support their guidance to the target. However the R-73 and R-60 are infra-red heat seeking missiles. They only require power, liquid nitrogen &quot;to cool the seeker head&quot;, and a pylon to launch the missile. These missiles have been paired with a &quot;US made FLIR Systems ULTRA 8500 turrets&quot;. Only one near miss has been verified and that was a R-27T fired at Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA. However the drawback is that these missiles are intended to be fired from one jet fighter against another. So the motors and fuel load are smaller than a purpose built surface to air missile.

On the Western side, the Norwegian-American made NASAMS air defense system has been developed for using AIM-9 Sidewinder, IRIS-T and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles to intercept targets. None of these missiles require modifications and hence it is possible for the system to take missiles straight from an aircraft. After a live-fire test occurred in September 2020 off the coasts of Florida, during which it successfully engaged a simulated cruise missile, in 2022 NASAMS was deployed to Ukraine, where for the first time this missile system was used in real combat conditions, and, according to Ukrainian government, was able to shoot down more than 100 aerial targets.

==Warhead==

A conventional explosive blast warhead, fragmentation warhead, or continuous rod warhead (or a combination of any of those three warhead types) is typically used in the attempt to disable or destroy the target aircraft. Warheads are typically detonated by a proximity fuze or by an impact fuze if it scores a direct hit. Less commonly, nuclear warheads have been mounted on a small number of air-to-air missile types (such as the AIM-26 Falcon) although these have never been used in combat.

==Guidance==

Guided missiles operate by detecting their target (usually by either radar or infrared methods, although rarely others such as laser guidance or optical tracking), and then &quot;homing&quot; in on the target on a collision course.

Although the missile may use radar or infra-red guidance to home on the target, the launching aircraft may detect and track the target before launch by other means. Infra-red guided missiles can be &quot;slaved&quot; to an attack radar in order to find the target and radar-guided missiles can be launched at targets detected visually or via an infra-red search and track (IRST) system, although they may require the attack radar to illuminate the target during part or all of the missile interception itself.

===Radar guidance===
Radar guidance is normally used for medium- or long-range missiles, where the infra-red signature of the target would be too faint for an infra-red detector to track. There are three major types of radar-guided missile – active, semi-active, and passive.

Radar-guided missiles can be countered by rapid maneuvering (which may result in them &quot;breaking lock&quot;, or may cause them to overshoot), deploying chaff or using electronic counter-measures.

====Active radar homing====
Active radar (AR)-guided missiles carry their own radar system to detect and track their target. However, the size of the radar antenna is limited by the small diameter of missiles, limiting its range which typically means such missiles are launched at a predicted future location of the target, often relying on separate guidance systems such as Global Positioning System, inertial guidance, or a mid-course update from either the launching aircraft or other system that can communicate with the missile to get the missile close to the target. At a predetermined point (frequently based on time since launch or arrival near the predicted target location) the missile&#x27;s radar system is activated (the missile is said to &quot;go active&quot;), and the missile then homes in on the target.

If the range from the attacking aircraft to the target is within the range of the missile&#x27;s radar system, the missile can &quot;go active&quot; immediately upon launch.

The great advantage of an active radar homing system is that it enables a &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; mode of attack, where the attacking aircraft is free to pursue other targets or escape the area after launching the missile.

====Semi-active radar homing====
Semi-active radar homing (SARH) guided missiles are simpler and more common. They function by detecting radar energy reflected from the target. The radar energy is emitted from the launching aircraft&#x27;s own radar system.

However, this means that the launch aircraft has to maintain a &quot;lock&quot; on the target (keep illuminating the target aircraft with its own radar) until the missile makes the interception. This limits the attacking aircraft&#x27;s ability to maneuver, which may be necessary should threats to the attacking aircraft appear.

An advantage of SARH-guided missiles is that they are homing on the reflected radar signal, so accuracy actually increases as the missile gets closer because the reflection comes from a &quot;point source&quot;: the target. Against this, if there are multiple targets, each will be reflecting the same radar signal and the missile may become confused as to which target is its intended victim. The missile may well be unable to pick a specific target and fly through a formation without passing within lethal range of any specific aircraft. Newer missiles have logic circuits in their guidance systems to help prevent this problem.

At the same time, jamming the missile lock-on is easier because the launching aircraft is further from the target than the missile, so the radar signal has to travel further and is greatly attenuated over the distance. This means that the missile may be jammed or &quot;spoofed&quot; by countermeasures whose signals grow stronger as the missile gets closer. One counter to this is a &quot;home on jam&quot; capability in the missile that allows it to home in on the jamming signal.

====Beam riding====
An early form of radar guidance was &quot;beam-riding&quot; (BR). In this method, the attacking aircraft directs a narrow beam of radar energy at the target. The air-to-air missile was launched into the beam, where sensors on the aft of the missile controlled the missile, keeping it within the beam. So long as the beam was kept on the target aircraft, the missile would ride the beam until making the interception.

While conceptually simple, the move is hard because of the challenge of simultaneously keeping the beam solidly on the target (which could not be relied upon to cooperate by flying straight and level), continuing to fly one&#x27;s own aircraft, and monitoring enemy countermeasures.

An added complication was that the beam will spread out into a cone shape as the distance from the attacking aircraft increases. This will result in less accuracy for the missile because the beam may actually be larger than the target aircraft when the missile arrives. The missile could be securely within the beam but still not be close enough to destroy the target.

===Infrared guidance===

Infrared guided (IR) missiles home on the heat produced by an aircraft. Early infra-red detectors had poor sensitivity, so could only track the hot exhaust pipes of an aircraft. This meant an attacking aircraft had to maneuver to a position behind its target before it could fire an infra-red guided missile. This also limited the range of the missile as the infra-red signature soon become too small to detect with increasing distance and after launch the missile was playing &quot;catch-up&quot; with its target. Early infrared seekers were unusable in clouds or rain (which is still a limitation to some degree) and could be distracted by the sun, a reflection of the sun off of a cloud or ground object, or any other &quot;hot&quot; object within its view.

More modern infra-red guided missiles can detect the heat of an aircraft&#x27;s skin, warmed by the friction of airflow, in addition to the fainter heat signature of the engine when the aircraft is seen from the side or head-on. This, combined with greater maneuverability, gives them an &quot;all-aspect&quot; capability, and an attacking aircraft no longer had to be behind its target to fire. Although launching from behind the target increases the probability of a hit, the launching aircraft usually has to be closer to the target in such a tail-chase engagement.

An aircraft can defend against infra-red missiles by dropping flares that are hotter than the aircraft, so the missile homes in on the brighter, hotter target. In turn, IR missiles may employ filters to enable it to ignore targets whose temperature is not within a specified range.

Towed decoys which closely mimic engine heat and infra-red jammers can also be used. Some large aircraft and many combat helicopters make use of so-called &quot;hot brick&quot; infra-red jammers, typically mounted near the engines. Current research is developing laser devices which can spoof or destroy the guidance systems of infra-red guided missiles. See Infrared countermeasure.

Start of the 21st century missiles such as the ASRAAM use an &quot;imaging infrared&quot; seeker which &quot;sees&quot; the target (much like a digital video camera), and can distinguish between an aircraft and a point heat source such as a flare. They also feature a very wide detection angle, so the attacking aircraft does not have to be pointing straight at the target for the missile to lock on. The pilot can use a helmet mounted sight (HMS) and target another aircraft by looking at it, and then firing. This is called &quot;off-boresight&quot; launch. For example, the Russian Su-27 is equipped with an infra-red search and track (IRST) system with laser rangefinder for its HMS-aimed missiles.

===Electro-optical===
A recent advancement in missile guidance is electro-optical imaging. The Israeli Python-5 has an electro-optical seeker that scans designated area for targets via optical imaging. Once a target is acquired, the missile will lock-on to it for the kill. Electro-optical seekers can be programmed to target vital area of an aircraft, such as the cockpit. Since it does not depend on the target aircraft&#x27;s heat signature, it can be used against low-heat targets such as UAVs and cruise missiles. However, clouds can get in the way of electro-optical sensors.

===Passive anti-radiation===

Evolving missile guidance designs are converting the anti-radiation missile (ARM) design, pioneered during Vietnam and used to home in against emitting surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, to an air intercept weapon. Current air-to-air passive anti-radiation missile development is thought to be a countermeasure to airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C – also known as AEW or AWACS) aircraft which typically mount powerful search radars.

Due to their dependence on target aircraft radar emissions, when used against fighter aircraft passive anti-radiation missiles are primarily limited to forward-aspect intercept geometry. For examples, see Vympel R-27 and Brazo.

Another aspect of passive anti-radiation homing is the &quot;home on jam&quot; mode which, when installed, allows a radar-guided missile to home in on the jammer of the target aircraft if the primary seeker is jammed by the electronic countermeasures of the target aircraft.

==Design==

Air-to-air missiles are typically long, thin cylinders in order to reduce their cross section and thus minimize drag at the high speeds at which they travel. Missiles are divided into five primary systems (moving forward to aft): seeker, guidance, warhead, motor, and control actuation.

At the front is the seeker, either a radar system, radar homer, or infra-red detector. Behind that lies the avionics which control the missile. Typically after that, in the centre of the missile, is the warhead, usually several kilograms of high explosive surrounded by metal that fragments on detonation (or in some cases, pre-fragmented metal).

The rear part of the missile contains the propulsion system, usually a rocket of some type and the control actuation system or CAS. Dual-thrust solid-fuel rockets are common, but some longer-range missiles use liquid-fuel motors that can &quot;throttle&quot; to extend their range and preserve fuel for energy-intensive final maneuvering. Some solid-fuelled missiles mimic this technique with a second rocket motor which burns during the terminal homing phase. There are missiles, such as the MBDA Meteor, that &quot;breathe&quot; air (using a ramjet, similar to a jet engine) in order to extend their range.

Modern missiles use &quot;low-smoke&quot; motors – early missiles produced thick smoke trails, which were easily seen by the crew of the target aircraft alerting them to the attack and helping them determine how to evade it.

The CAS is typically an electro-mechanical, servo control actuation system, which takes input from the guidance system and manipulates the airfoils or fins at the rear of the missile that guide or steers the weapon to target.

Nowadays, countries start developing hypersonic air-to-air missile using scramjet engines (such as R-37, or AIM-260 JATM), which not only increases efficiency for BVR battles, but it also makes survival chances of target aircraft drop to nearly zero.

==Performance==
A number of terms frequently crop up in discussions of air-to-air missile performance.

; Launch success zone: The Launch Success Zone is the range within which there is a high (defined) kill probability against a target that remains unaware of its engagement until the final moment. When alerted visually or by a warning system the target attempts a last-ditch-manoeuvre sequence.
; F-pole: A closely related term is the F-Pole. This is the slant range between the launch aircraft and target, at the time of interception. The greater the F-Pole, the greater the confidence that the launch aircraft will achieve air superiority with that missile.
; A-pole: This is the slant range between the launch aircraft and target at the time that the missile begins active guidance or acquires the target with the missile&#x27;s active seeker. The greater the A-Pole means less time and possibly greater distance that the launch aircraft needs to support the missile guidance until missile seeker acquisition.
; No-escape zone: The no-escape zone is the zone within which there is a high (defined) kill probability against a target even if it has been alerted. This zone is defined as a conical shape with the tip at the missile launch. The cone&#x27;s length and width are determined by the missile and seeker performance. A missile&#x27;s speed, range and seeker sensitivity will mostly determine the length of this imaginary cone, while its agility (turn rate) and seeker complexity (speed of detection and ability to detect off axis targets) will determine the width of the cone.

===Missile minimum range===
A missile is subject to a minimum range, before which it cannot maneuver effectively. In order to maneuver sufficiently from a poor launch angle at short ranges to hit its target, some missiles use thrust vectoring, which allow the missile to start turning &quot;off the rail&quot;, before its motor has accelerated it up to high enough speeds for its small aerodynamic surfaces to be useful.

==Short-range air-to-air missile==

Short-range air-to-air missiles (SRAAMs), typically used in &quot;dogfighting&quot; or close range air combat compare to the beyond-visual-range missiles. Most of the short-range air-to-air missiles are infrared guided.

=== SRAAM missile evolution ===

Those missiles usually classified into five &quot;generations&quot; according to the historical technological advances. Most of these advances were in infrared seeker technology (later combined with digital signal processing).

=== First generation ===
Early short-range missiles such as the early Sidewinders and K-13 (missile) (&quot;AA-2 Atoll&quot;) had infrared seekers with a narrow (30-degree) field of view and required the attacker to position himself behind the target (rear aspect engagement). This meant that the target aircraft only had to perform a slight turn to move outside the missile seeker&#x27;s field of view and cause the missile to lose track of the target (&quot;break lock&quot;).

=== Second generation ===
The second-generation of short-range missiles utilized more effective seekers that were better cooled than its predecessors while being typically &quot;uncaged&quot;; resulting in improved sensitivity to heat signatures, an increase in field of view as well as allowing the possibility of leading a missile within its FOV for an increased probability of kill against a maneuvering target. In some cases, the improved sensitivity to heat signatures allows for a very limited side and even all-aspect tracking, as is the case with the Red Top missile. In conjunction with improved control surfaces and propulsion motors over the first generation of dogfight missiles, the technological advances of the second-generation short-range missiles allowed them to be used not just on non-maneuvering bombers, but also actively maneuvering fighters. Examples include advanced derivatives of the K-13 (missile) and AIM-9 such as K-13M (R-13M, Object 380) or AIM-9D / G / H.

=== Third generation ===
This generation introduced much more sensitive seekers that are capable of locking onto the warm heat irradiated by the skins of aircraft from the front or side aspects, as opposed to just the hotter engine nozzle(s) from rear-aspect, allowing for a true all-aspect capability. This significantly expanded potential attacking envelopes, allowing the attacker to fire at a target which was side-on or front-on to itself as opposed to just the rear. While the field-of-view was still restricted to a fairly narrow cone, the attack at least did not have to be behind the target.

Also typical of the third generation of short-range missiles are further improved agility over the previous generation as well as their ability to radar-slave; which is acquiring tracking data from the launching aircraft&#x27;s radar or IRST systems, allowing attackers to launch missiles without ever pointing the nose of the aircraft at an enemy prior to leading the missile. Examples of this generation of dogfight missiles include the R-60M or the Python-3.

=== Fourth generation ===
The R-73 (missile) (&quot;AA-11 Archer&quot;) entered service in 1985 and marked a new generation of dogfight missile. It had a wider field of view and could be cued onto a target using a helmet mounted sight. This allowed it to be launched at targets that would otherwise not be seen by older generation missiles that generally stared forward while waiting to be launched. This capability, combined with a more powerful motor that allows the missile to maneuver against crossing targets and launch at greater ranges, gives the launching aircraft improved tactical freedom.

Other members of the 4th generation use focal plane arrays to offer greatly improved scanning and countermeasures resistance (especially against flares). These missiles are also much more agile, some by employing thrust vectoring (typically gimballed thrust).

=== Fifth generation ===

The latest generation of short-range missiles again defined by advances in seeker technologies, this time electro-optical imaging infrared (IIR) seekers that allow the missiles to &quot;see&quot; images rather than single &quot;points&quot; of infrared radiation (heat). The sensors combined with more powerful digital signal processing provide the following benefits:
* greater infrared counter countermeasures (IRCCM) ability, by being able to distinguish aircraft from infrared countermeasures (IRCM) such as flares.
* greater sensitivity means greater range and ability to identify smaller low flying targets such as UAVs.
* more detailed target image allows targeting of more vulnerable parts of aircraft instead of just homing in on the brightest infrared source (exhaust).

Examples of fifth generation short-range missiles include:
* R-73M (&quot;AA-11 Archer&quot;) – Russia (1994–)
* ASRAAM – UK (1998–)

<doc id="320578" wikidata="Q2908743" url="?curid=320578" title="Tarski's theorem about choice">
<text>In mathematics, Tarski&#x27;s theorem, proved by , states that in ZF the theorem &quot;For every infinite set formula_1, there is a bijective map between the sets formula_1 and formula_3&quot; implies the axiom of choice. The opposite direction was already known, thus the theorem and axiom of choice are equivalent.

Tarski told that when he tried to publish the theorem in &quot;Comptes Rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences de Paris&quot;, Fréchet and Lebesgue refused to present it. Fréchet wrote that an implication between two well known propositions is not a new result. Lebesgue wrote that an implication between two false propositions is of no interest.

==Proof==

The goal is to prove that the axiom of choice is implied by the statement &quot;for every infinite set formula_4 formula_5&quot;. 
It is known that the well-ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice; thus it is enough to show that the statement implies that for every set formula_6 there exists a well-order.

Since the collection of all ordinals such that there exists a surjective function from formula_6 to the ordinal is a set, there exists an infinite ordinal, formula_8 such that there is no surjective function from formula_6 to formula_10 
We assume without loss of generality that the sets formula_6 and formula_12 are disjoint. 
By the initial assumption, formula_13 thus there exists a bijection formula_14

For every formula_15 it is impossible that formula_16 because otherwise we could define a surjective function from formula_6 to formula_10 
Therefore, there exists at least one ordinal formula_19 such that formula_20 so the set formula_21 is not empty.

We can define a new function: formula_22 
This function is well defined since formula_23 is a non-empty set of ordinals, and so has a minimum. 
For every formula_24 the sets formula_23 and formula_26 are disjoint. 
Therefore, we can define a well order on formula_27 for every formula_28 we define formula_29 since the image of formula_30 that is, formula_31 is a set of ordinals and therefore well ordered.

<text>The Confessional Baptist Association, previously known as the Association of Reformed Baptist Churches in America, is an association of Reformed Baptist churches in the United States. The headquarters is in Mansfield, Texas.

==History==
On November 12–13, 1996, fifteen Reformed Baptist churches met at Heritage Church in Fayetteville, Georgia to begin the planning of a national association of churches. Four months later on March 11, 1997, the Association of Reformed Baptist Churches of America was founded in Mesa, Arizona. The union was founded in 1997 as the Association of Reformed Baptist Churches of America by 24 member churches from 14 states.

In 2022, the organization moved to legally dissolve the current organization, and created a new organization headquartered in Mansfield, Texas named &quot;Confessional Baptist Association&quot; along with a new set of bylaws for the new association. In 2023, the association held its first general assembly at Oak Grove Baptist Church in Angier, North Carolina, which consisted of the 13 founding member churches of the new association.

==Theology==
The association&#x27;s churches all subscribe to the &quot;1689 Baptist Confession of Faith&quot;. The association&#x27;s General Assembly has noted that their adherence to this Confession means &quot;the model for (association) churches is Puritan and not one of a number of competing contemporary ones.&quot;

==Theological training==
ARBCA originally founded the Institute of Reformed Baptist Studies (IRBS) at Westminster Seminary California which provides training for seminarians as part of studies toward a Master of Divinity degree program. The seminary is now located on the campus of Heritage Baptist Church in Mansfield, Texas and maintains a relationship with the CBA and other organizations.

==Missions==
In 2000, ARBCA merged with the Reformed Baptist Mission Services (RBMS), a foreign missions organization. RBMS, though founded 12 years before the ARBCA, had acted as the foreign mission arm of the association, until the dissolution of ARBCA in 2022.

ARBCA was recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense as an endorsing agency for United States military chaplains.

==Church Planting==
The mission of CBA is to assist local churches in the planting of Reformed Baptist churches that subscribe to the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.

In 2023, at the 1st General Assembly, the Confessional Baptist Association conditionally agreed to financially support Redeemer Reformed Baptist Church in Belton, Texas which is an existing church plant of Emmanuel Reformed Baptist Church in Georgetown, Texas. This funding was provided to temporarily assist the pastoral efforts of the Emmanuel Reformed Baptist Church&#x27;s elders (in their search for a candidate for church planter), until the association&#x27;s next opportunity to discuss a long-term funding plan for the church plant at the next annual general assembly.

<doc id="320594" wikidata="Q753053" url="?curid=320594" title="Gummy bear">
<text>Gummy bears (German: &quot;Gummibär&quot;) are small, fruit gum candies, similar to a jelly baby in some English-speaking countries. The candy is roughly long and shaped in the form of a bear. The gummy bear is one of many gummies, popular gelatin-based candies sold in a variety of shapes and colors by various brands such as Haribo.

==History==
The gummy bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name (gum or gummy bear), or in the diminutive form ([little] gum or gummy bear). Gum arabic was the original base ingredient used to produce the gummy bears, hence the name &quot;gum&quot; or &quot;gummy&quot;. Hans Riegel Sr., a confectioner from Bonn, started the Haribo company in 1920. In 1922, inspired by the trained bears seen at street festivities and markets in Europe through to the 19th century, he invented the Dancing Bear (&quot;Tanzbär&quot;), a small, affordable, fruit-flavored gum candy treat for children and adults alike, which was much larger in form than its later successor, the Gold-Bear (&quot;Goldbär&quot;). Even during Weimar Germany&#x27;s hyperinflation period that wreaked havoc on the country, Haribo&#x27;s fruit-gum Dancing Bear treats remained affordably priced for a mere one pfennig per pair at kiosks. The success of the Dancing Bear&#x27;s successor would later become Haribo&#x27;s world-famous Gold-Bears candy product in 1967.

==Variations and flavours==

The success of gummy bears has spawned the production of many other gummy candies made to resemble animals and other objects, such as rings, worms, frogs, snakes, hamburgers, cherries, sharks, penguins, hippos, lobsters, octopuses, apples, peaches, oranges, &quot;Ampelmännchen&quot;, Smurfs and spiders. Manufacturers offer a range of sizes including bears that weigh several kilograms.

In the United States, Haribo gummy bears are sold in five flavors: raspberry (red); orange (orange); strawberry (green); pineapple (colorless); and lemon (yellow). Trolli&#x27;s bears are most often sold in five flavors in the United States, and in the same colors; however, Trolli&#x27;s red bear is strawberry-flavored, while the green is lime and the colorless is grape. Many companies emulate either Haribo or Trolli flavor-color combinations. Health-oriented brands, which often use all-natural flavors, sometimes opt for more and different flavors. For example, the boxed bulk gummies sold by Sunflower/Newflower Markets include grape, pineapple-coconut and peach, among others.

==Ingredients and production==

The traditional gummy bear is made from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid and gelatin. However, recipes vary, such as organic candy, those suitable for vegetarians or those following religious dietary laws.

Production uses a specialized machine called a starch mogul. The image of the gummy bear is stamped into a tray filled with powdered starch. The hot, liquid mixture is poured into the indentations in the starch and allowed to cool overnight. Once the mixture has set, the candies can be removed from the mold and packaged. The molds are open on top, so only the bear&#x27;s front is formed while the back remains flat. The original design for each type of candy is carved into plaster by an artist, then duplicated by a machine and used to create the starch molds for the production line.

Gummy bears made with bovine, porcine or piscine gelatin are not suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Those with porcine gelatin or from animals not slaughtered in either of the two contradictory ritualistic fashions do not conform to kashrut or halal dietary laws. In its factory in Turkey, Haribo produces halal bears and other sweets made with bovine gelatin. Also, some gummy bears are made with pectin or starch instead of gelatin, making them suitable for vegetarians.

Large sour gummy bears are larger and flatter than regular ones, have a softer texture and include fumaric acid or other acid ingredients to produce a sour flavor. Some manufacturers produce sour bears with a different texture based on starch instead of gelatin. Typically, starch produces a shorter (cleaner bite, less chewy) texture than does gelatin.

==Health issues==

Gummy bears ordinarily contain mostly empty calories, but recently gummy bears containing vitamin C, produced by manufacturers such as Sconza or Bear Essentials, have been marketed to parents of young children. Gummy supplements containing vitamins have also been produced in the form of gummy bears to motivate consumption by young, picky eaters.

Gummy bears, and other gummy candy, stick to teeth and may cause tooth decay. However, gummy bears containing the cavity-fighting additive xylitol (wood sugar) are now being tested. Trolli has developed its &quot;acti-line&quot; of gummy candy that it claims will help the immune system and teeth.

There has been concern that gelatin in most gummy bears may harbor prions, particularly those that cause bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and new-variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans. Based on studies, the United States FDA and other national organizations and countries consider the risk of BSE transmission through gelatin to be minuscule as long as precautions are followed during manufacturing.

<doc id="320598" wikidata="Q164742" url="?curid=320598" title="Tour de France Soundtracks">
<text>Tour de France Soundtracks (renamed to Tour de France for its remastered release) is the eleventh studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk. It was first released on 4 August 2003, through Kling Klang and EMI in Europe and Astralwerks in North America. The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its intended release date for the actual tour. It includes a new recording of their 1983 song of the same name, the cover artwork of both releases being nearly identical. The announcement of the release caused much anticipation, as it had been 17 years since the group had put out a full album of new studio material (1986&#x27;s &quot;Electric Café&quot;, also known as &quot;Techno Pop&quot;). It is also the last studio album to feature Florian Schneider before his departure from the band in 2008 and his death on 21 April 2020.

The album received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success. It reached in Germany, the top 40 in the UK, as well as in the US dance charts.

== Composition ==
Kitty Empire of &quot;The Observer&quot; labeled &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; a techno album. Unusual for a Kraftwerk album, it did not have separate German and international vocal mixes, but was released only in one version, with a mix of French, German, and English. The lyrics were co-written by Ralf Hütter and Maxime Schmitt, who had previously been manager of the Capitol label at Pathé-Marconi (part of the EMI group, the company that distributed Kraftwerk&#x27;s music in France) and had been involved with the band since the mid-1970s.

== Promotion and release ==

&quot;Tour de France&quot; was released in June 1983 and the album includes a new recording of the song. &quot;Tour de France 2003&quot; was released in July 2003 and includes the songs &quot;Tour de France Étape 1&quot;, &quot;Tour de France Étape 2&quot; and &quot;Tour de France Étape 3&quot;. A short jingle was supplied to the television broadcaster Eurosport for use in their coverage of the 2003 Tour de France. &quot;Elektro Kardiogramm&quot; was released as a promotional single in October 2003. &quot;Aerodynamik&quot; was released as a single in March 2004. &quot;Aerodynamik/La Forme Remixes&quot; was released as a remix single on 17 September 2007, including remixes of the songs &quot;Aerodynamik&quot; and &quot;La Forme&quot; by Hot Chip.

&quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; took the band on an extensive world tour in 2004. On the tour, they performed the music from four laptop computers running sequencing, sampling, and synthesizer software, also controlling and synchronised with large video displays. In 2005, Kraftwerk released &quot;Minimum-Maximum&quot;, with separate audio and video releases featuring songs performed at various venues during the 2004 tour.

A newly remastered edition of the album with the revised title &quot;Tour de France&quot; was released by EMI Records, Mute Records, and Astralwerks Records on CD and digital download in October–November 2009, with heavyweight vinyl editions released in November–December 2009.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot; became the highest charting Kraftwerk album. It peaked at number one in Germany, becoming the band&#x27;s first number one in their home country. However, it did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, even though every Kraftwerk studio album since &quot;Ralf and Florian&quot; (1973) had charted there.

<doc id="320600" wikidata="Q5618296" url="?curid=320600" title="Gun Control Act of 1968">
<text>The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA or GCA68) is a U.S. federal law that regulates the firearms industry and firearms ownership. Due to constitutional limitations, the Act is primarily based on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except by manufacturers, dealers and importers licensed under a scheme set up under the Act.

The GCA was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22, 1968, and is Title I of the U.S. federal firearms laws. The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) is Title II. Both GCA and NFA are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

18 USC was first enacted by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. GCA repealed the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, though many of its provisions were reenacted as part of the GCA, which revised the FFA and its predecessor, the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA).

==History==
The bill was initially prompted by the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963. The President was shot and killed with a rifle purchased by mail order from an ad in the magazine &quot;American Rifleman&quot;. Congressional hearings followed and a ban on mail-order gun sales was discussed, but no law was passed until 1968. At the hearings NRA Executive Vice-President Franklin Orth supported a ban on mail-order sales, stating, &quot;We do not think that any sane American, who calls himself an American, can object to placing into this bill the instrument which killed the president of the United States.&quot;

Precursors of the passage of the Gun Control Act were Senate Bill 1975 in 1963, &quot;A Bill to Regulate the Interstate Shipment of Firearms&quot;, and Senate Bill 1592 in 1965, &quot;A Bill to Amend the Federal Firearms Act of 1938&quot;. Both were introduced by Senator Thomas J. Dodd but in both cases the bill was met with fierce opposition, effectively shutting down the earliest efforts for gun control legislation regarding the mail-order rifles. The bill was once again introduced into the House of Representatives by the House Judiciary Committee on January 10, 1967, with this instance resulting in the bill staying on the legislative docket.

The April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., shortly followed by the June 5 assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the shooting at the University of Texas two years previously, compounded by shifting societal attitudes towards gun ownership, renewed efforts to pass the bill. On June 11, 1968, a tie vote in the House Judiciary Committee halted the bill&#x27;s passage. On reconsideration nine days later, the bill was passed by the committee. The Senate Judiciary Committee similarly brought the bill to a temporary halt, but as in the House, it was passed on reconsideration. House Resolution 17735, known as the Gun Control Act, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 22, 1968 banning mail-order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons, drug users, and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns. This act also included provisions that redefined the definitions of firearms within the United States and provided more rules for weapons manufacturers and licensed sellers on interstate commerce of ammunition and other firearm accessories.

==Prohibited persons==
When it took effect in 1968, the Gun Control Act of 1968 stated that firearm sales were prohibited to anyone who &quot;(1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in a court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; (2) is a fugitive from justice; (3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to marihuana or any depressant or stimulant drug (as defined in section 201 (v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) or narcotic drug (as defined in section 4731 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954)&quot;

The Gun Control Act of 1968 was amended in 1993 by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act which introduced a background check requirement of prospective gun purchasers by licensed sellers, and created a list of categories of individuals to whom the sale of firearms is prohibited: It would also be amended again in 1994 by the Violence Against Women Act to strengthen firearm bans against domestic abusers. The amended law stated:

It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person—

(1) is under indictment for, or has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;

(2) is a fugitive from justice;

(3) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));

(4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution;

(5) who, being an alien;

: (A) is illegally or unlawfully in the United States; or
: (B) except as provided in subsection (y)(2), has been admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(26) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(26)))

(6) who has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions;

(7) who, having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced their citizenship;

(8) is subject to a court order that restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child, except that this paragraph shall only apply to a court order that—

: (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received actual notice, and at which such person had the opportunity to participate; and
: (B)
: (i) includes a finding that such person represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner or child; or
: (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury; or

(9) has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

With the following exceptions:

(ii) A person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or set aside, or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored (if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense) unless the pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.

18 U.S.C 922 (3) imposes punishment for being a drug addict, which was found to be unconstitutional by SCOTUS in Robinson v. California in 1962.
While many states upon completion of a sentence automatically reinstate rights to vote, sit on a jury, or serve in public office, no states restore gun ownership rights upon completion of a sentence. Some states reinstate rights depending on the crime convicted of, and others have a petition process. Those convicted of a federal offense must contact the Office of the Pardon Attorney, Department of Justice, to receive a presidential pardon. Under the Department&#x27;s rules governing petitions for executive clemency, 28 C.F.R. §§ 1.1 et seq., an applicant must satisfy a minimum waiting period of five years before he becomes eligible to apply for a presidential pardon of his federal conviction.

According to a 21 Sep 2011 &quot;Open Letter to All Federal Firearms Licensees&quot; from the ATF, holders of state-issued medical marijuana cards are automatically &quot;prohibited people&quot; under 18 U.S.C 922 (g)(3) and &quot;shipping, transporting, receiving or possessing firearms or ammunition&quot; by a medical marijuana card holder is a violation.

Additionally, 18 U.S.C 922 (x) generally prohibits people under 18 years of age from possessing handguns or handgun ammunition with certain exceptions for employment, target practice, education, and a handgun possessed while defending the home of the juvenile or a home in which they are a guest.

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 created the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to prevent firearms sales to such prohibited people.

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 strengthened bans against domestic abusers by enforcing domestic violence protection orders which barred people subject to family violence protection orders from having firearms.

==Federal Firearms License (FFL) system==
The Gun Control Act mandated the licensing of individuals and companies engaged in the business of selling firearms. This provision effectively prohibited the direct mail order of firearms (except antique firearms) by consumers and mandated that anyone who wants to buy a gun in an interstate transaction from a source other than a private individual must do so through a federally licensed firearms dealer. The Act also banned unlicensed individuals from acquiring handguns outside their state of residence. The interstate purchase of long guns (rifles and shotguns) was not impeded by the Act so long as the seller is federally licensed and such a sale is allowed by both the state of purchase and the state of residence.

Private sales between residents of two different states are also prohibited without going through a licensed dealer, except for the case of a buyer holding a Curio &amp; Relic license purchasing a firearm that qualifies as a curio or relic.

Private sales between unlicensed individuals who are residents of the same state are allowed under federal law so long as such transfers do not violate the other existing federal and state laws. While current law mandates that a background check be performed if the seller has a federal firearms license, private parties living in the same state are not required to perform such checks under federal law.

A person who does not have a Federal Firearms License may not be &quot;in the business&quot; of buying or selling firearms. Individuals buying and selling firearms without a federal license must be doing so from their collection.

Under the Gun Control Act, a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector shall not sell or deliver any rifle or shotgun or ammunition for rifle or shotgun to any individual less than 18 years of age, nor any handgun or ammunition for a handgun to any individual less than 21 years of age.

===Gunsmith and factory repair exception===
While the Gun Control Act prohibits the direct mail-ordering of firearms, a person may ship a gun via contract carrier (such as United Parcel Service (UPS), United States Postal Service, or FedEx) to a gunsmith (who has an FFL) or the gunmaker&#x27;s factory for repairs or modification. After the repair work is done, the gunsmith or the factory can ship the gun directly back to the customer.

==Import restrictions==

The GCA created what is known as the &quot;sporting purposes&quot; standard for imported firearms, saying that they must &quot;be generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes&quot;. GCA sporting purposes include hunting and organized competitive target shooting but do not include &quot;plinking&quot; or &quot;practical shooting&quot; (which the ATF says is closer to police/combat-style competition and not comparable to more traditional types of sports), nor does it allow for collection for historical or design interest.

==Marking requirements==
The law also required that all newly manufactured firearms produced by licensed manufacturers in the United States and imported into the United States bear a gun serial number. Firearms manufactured before the Gun Control Act and firearms manufactured by non-FFLs remain exempt from the serial number requirement. Defacement or removal of the serial number (if present) became a felony offense under the law where previously no serial number was required.

==Commentary==
In a June 1966 essay, Neal Knox wrote that what was then called the Dodd Bill was opposed by outdoorsmen and conservationists Harry R. Woodward, C. R. Gutermuth of the Wildlife Management Institute, Richard H. Stroud of the Sport Fishing Institute, Howard Carter Jr. of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, E. C. Hadley of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute, Robert T. Dennis of the Izaak Walton League, &quot;and countless other sportsmen, and sportsmen and industry groups&quot; because it would have a far-reaching and damaging effect on the hunting and shooting sports, while failing to reduce crime.

In his remarks upon signing the act in October 1968, Johnson said:

&quot;Congress adopted most of our recommendations. But this bill—as big as this bill is—still falls short, because we just could not get the Congress to carry out the requests we made of them. I asked for the national registration of all guns and the licensing of those who carry those guns. For the fact of life is that there are over 160 million guns in this country—more firearms than families. If guns are to be kept out of the hands of the criminal, out of the hands of the insane, and out of the hands of the irresponsible, then we just must have licensing. If the criminal with a gun is to be tracked down quickly, then we must have registration in this country. The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation. They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year.&quot;

At the time of its passage in 1968, NRA executive vice president Franklin Orth wrote in &quot;American Rifleman&quot; that &quot;the measure as a whole appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can live with&quot;.

In the May 1993 issue of &quot;Guns &amp; Ammo&quot; magazine, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO) compared the GCA to Nazi gun laws.

In a 2011 article noting the death of former U.S. Senator James A. McClure, the NRA called provisions of the GCA &quot;draconian&quot;. McClure was a cosponsor of the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA) of 1986, also called the McClure-Volkmer Act.

Political scientist Robert Spitzer wrote in 2011 that the Gun Control Act of 1968 &quot;provides an ideal case study to highlight the political processes affecting a direct effort to regulate firearms&quot;. He also stated in his book that President Johnson&#x27;s proposal called for national registration of all guns as well as licensing for all gun carriers, but his influence over the enacted law was small. House Rules Committee chair William Colmer only released H.R. 17735 to the floor after Judiciary Committee chair Emanuel Celler promised to oppose efforts to add licensing and registration provisions.

<doc id="320610" wikidata="Q9049302" url="?curid=320610" title="Neobalaenidae">
<text>Neobalaenidae is a family of baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti) including the extant pygmy right whale. Although traditionally considered related to balaenids, recent studies by Fordyce and Marx (2013) and Ludovic Dutoit and colleagues (2023) have recovered the living pygmy right whale as a member of Cetotheriidae, making it the only extant cetotheriid. Not all authors agree with this placement.

==Taxonomy==
The family Neobalaenidae was long restricted to the pygmy right whale from the Southern Hemisphere due to the unusual skeletal form of the species relative to other extant mysticetes. Until the early 2010s Neobalaenidae was unknown from the fossil record despite a study by Sasaki et al. (2005) placing the divergence date of Neobalaenidae from other living baleen whales at 23 mya.

Fordyce and Marx found that the pygmy right whale formed a well-supported clade with Eschrichtiidae and Balaenopteridae based on molecular data, and that, within &#x27;cetotheres&#x27;, it was most closely related to the herpetocetines (&quot;Herpetocetus&quot; and &quot;Nannocetus&quot;), rendering the pygmy right whale the only living species of Cetotheriidae. Around the same time, Bisconti had described the first pygmy right whale from the fossil record, &quot;Miocaperea&quot;, from the Pisco Formation of Peru. Bisconti, however, found, based on morphological data, it to be more closely related to Balaenidae (the bowhead and right whales), but added that additional specimens are expected to resolve these conflicting results within a few years. Cladistic analyses by Gol&#x27;din and Steeman partly agreed with Fordyce and Marx in recovering neobalaenids as closer to cetotheres than to Balaenidae, but disagreed with their recovery of the pygmy right whale as a herpetocetine, instead recovering Neobalaenidae outside Cetotheriidae.

==Fossil record==
Examples of Neobalaenidae in the fossil record include &quot;Miocaperea&quot;, a couple of indeterminate earbones from Australia (one similar to &quot;Caperea&quot;), and specimens from Pleistocene localities in the Northern Hemisphere.

<doc id="320611" wikidata="Q189615" url="?curid=320611" title="Pygmy right whale">
<text>The pygmy right whale (Caperea marginata) is a species of baleen whale. It may be a member of the cetotheres, a family of baleen whales which until 2012 were thought to be extinct; &quot;C. marginata&quot; has otherwise been considered the sole member of the family Neobalaenidae and is the only member of the genus Caperea. First described by John Edward Gray in 1846, it is the smallest of the baleen whales, ranging between in length and in mass. Despite its name, the pygmy right whale may have more in common with the gray whale and rorquals than the bowhead and right whales.

The pygmy right whale is found in temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere, and feeds on copepods and euphausiids. Little is known about its population or social habits. Unlike most other baleen whales, it has rarely been subject to exploitation.

== Taxonomy ==

During the 1839-45 voyage of James Clark Ross, naturalists found bones and baleen plates resembling a smaller version of the right whale. In his &quot;Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Erebus and Terror&quot; (1846), John Edward Gray described the new species, naming it &quot;Balaena marginata&quot;. In 1864, Gray established a new genus (&quot;Caperea&quot;) after receiving a skull and some bones of another specimen. Six years later, in 1870, he added the name &quot;Neobalaena&quot;. He soon realized the three species were one and the same: &quot;Caperea marginata&quot; (&quot;caperea&quot; means &quot;wrinkle&quot; in Latin, &quot;referring to the wrinkled appearance of the ear bone&quot;; while &quot;marginata&quot; translates to &quot;enclosed with a border&quot;, which &quot;refers to the dark border around the baleen plates of some individuals&quot;). In research findings published on December 18, 2012, paleontologist Felix Marx compared the skull bones of pygmy right whales to those of extinct cetaceans, finding it to be a close relative to the Cetotheriidae, making the pygmy right whale a living fossil. A 2023 study using genomic DNA confirmed that pygmy right whales are more closely related to rorquals than to balaenid right whales, consistent with a close relationship with the cetotheres.

In 2012, Italian palaeontologist Michelangelo Bisconti described &quot;Miocaperea pulchra&quot;, a first fossil pygmy right whale from Peru. This new genus differs from the living genus in some cranial details, but Bisconti&#x27;s study confirmed the monophyly of the Neobalaenidae and he concluded that the rorqual-like features in &quot;C. marginata&quot; must be the result of parallel evolution. The presence of a fossil neobalaenid some north of the known range of &quot;C. marginata&quot;, suggests that environmental change has caused a southern shift in neobalaenid distribution. A second, undescribed species was tentatively assigned to Neobalaenidae in 2012. A fossil from the Messinian age (Late Miocene) about 6.2 to 5.4 million years ago has been identified as &quot;Caperea&quot; sp. in 2018.

== Description ==

The pygmy right whale is rarely encountered and consequently little studied. However, it is known that it is by far the smallest of the baleen whales. Calves are estimated to be about to at birth (an approximately fetus was reported from a female that had stranded in Perkins Bay, Tasmania, in 1982). By the time they are weaned, they may be about long. It is believed they become sexually mature at about and physically mature at about . The longest male registered, was a individual which had stranded in Cloudy Bay, Tasmania, while the longest female was a individual which had stranded in Stanley, Tasmania in 1981. Pygmy right whales can weigh as much as . A female weighed and a male weighed . Gestation and lactation periods and longevity are all unknown. Part of the reason for the scarcity of data may be the relative inactivity of the whale, making location for study difficult. The blow is small and indistinct and the whale is usually a slow undulating swimmer, although capable of bursts of acceleration.

The coloring and shape of the pygmy right whale, dark gray dorsally and lighter gray ventrally, commonly with a pair of chevron-shaped lighter patches behind the eyes, is similar to that of the dwarf minke and Antarctic minke whales and at sea the species may easily be confused with these two species, in case the jaw and flippers are not carefully observed. The arched jawline is not as pronounced as other right whales and may not be sufficient to distinguish a pygmy right whale from a minke whale. The long, narrow cream-coloured baleen plates with a distinctive white gumline are the most effective discriminators. Unlike true right whales, pygmy rights do not have callosities. The dorsal fin is falcate (crescent-shaped) and located about three-quarters of the way along the back of the animal. Unlike the minke whales, occasionally the dorsal will not be seen on the whale surfacing. Like the minkes, though, it doesn&#x27;t raise its flukes when it dives.

The skull and skeleton of the pygmy right whale is unlike those of any other extant whale: the supraoccipital shield extends farther posteriorly; the ear bone has a lateral wrinkle and is roughly square in outline. All seven cervical vertebrae are fused, and the pygmy right has only 44 vertebrae. The 18 pairs of ribs are broad and flat, and make up 39–45% of the vertebral column (compared to 33% in other mysticetes). Each thoracic vertebrae has a pair of huge wing-like transverse processes, many of which overlap. The dorsal end of the ribs are remarkably thin and almost fail to make contact with the transverse processes. The reduced tail (or sacrocaudal region) features a vestigial pelvis and small chevron bones. The flippers have four digits. The lungs and heart are relatively small, which suggests that the pygmy right whale is not a deep diver. The larynx is reported to be different from any other cetacean.

Like other mysticetes, the pygmy right whale has a large laryngeal sac, but in contrast to other mysticetes, this sac is positioned on the right side of the midline in the pygmy right. The presence of this laryngeal sac can possibly be the explanation for the long thorax and flattened ribs, but the peculiar ribs have led to multiple speculations as to their origin.

== Behavior and ecology ==

Analysis of the stomach contents of dead pygmy right whales indicates that it feeds on copepods and euphausiids (krill). The social and mating structures are unknown. The whale is typically seen alone or in pairs, sometimes associated with other cetaceans (including dolphins, pilot whales, minke whales, and once a sei whale cow and calf). Occasionally larger groups are seen — in 2001 a group of 14 were seen at 46°S in the South Pacific about 450 km southeast of New Zealand, while in 1992 a group of about 80 individuals were seen southwest of Cape Leeuwin and another group of over 100 individuals were sighted in June 2007 about southwest of Portland, Victoria.

The flukes, blubber, and baleen plates of a pygmy right whale calf were found in a 7.47 m (24.5 ft) killer whale caught by whalers off South Africa.

== Population and distribution ==
The pygmy right whale is among the least studied cetaceans; until 2008, fewer than 25 sightings of the species had been made at sea. The species lives in the Southern Hemisphere and is believed to be , living in a band from about 30°S to 55°S in areas with surface water temperatures between . Individuals have been found on the coasts of Chile, Tierra del Fuego, Namibia, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. One group may be a year-round resident off Tasmania. The total population is unknown. 

There is an extralimital stranding record in the Northern Hemisphere.

== Whaling and whale-watching ==
On account of its relatively small size and sparse distribution, the pygmy right whale has rarely been taken by whalers. A male was taken off South Africa in 1917, and a couple were caught for scientific purposes by Soviet whalers in the South Atlantic in 1970. Also a few pygmy right whales are known to have been caught in fishing nets. These factors are not believed to have had a significant impact on the population.

Most data about pygmy right whales come from individual specimens washed up on coastlines; they are rarely encountered at sea and so they are not the primary subject of any whale watching cruises.

== Conservation ==
The pygmy right whale is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix II, as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

The pygmy right whale is also covered by Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<doc id="320612" wikidata="Q336278" url="?curid=320612" title="Neil Tennant">
<text>Neil Francis Tennant (born 10 July 1954) is an English singer, songwriter and music journalist, and co-founder of the synth-pop duo the Pet Shop Boys, which he formed with Chris Lowe in 1981. He was a journalist for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, and assistant editor for the magazine in the mid-1980s.

Tennant coined the phrase imperial phase to describe the period in which a musical artist is regarded to be at their commercial and creative peak simultaneously. This observation was initially self-referential, made as the Pet Shop Boys had achieved commercial success with four British number one hits (&quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot;, and &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;), had received critical praise for their first three albums and had expanded their creative horizons through innovative collaborations in the visual and performing arts.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Neil Francis Tennant was born in the town of North Shields, approximately 8 miles east of Newcastle upon Tyne, to William W. Tennant (1923–2009), a sales representative, and Sheila M. (Watson) Tennant (1923–2008). He has an older sister, Susan, and two younger brothers, Simon and Philip. The family moved to Greenfield Road (opposite the corner of South Bend), Brunton Park, Gosforth shortly after Neil was born.

Tennant attended St Cuthbert&#x27;s Grammar School, an all-boys&#x27; Catholic school in Newcastle upon Tyne. His songs &quot;This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot; refer to his early life in Catholic school and the strict upbringing there.

As a child, Tennant taught himself to play guitar and piano and started writing songs. He also played cello in school. During his teenage years, he played in a folk music group named Dust, who were heavily influenced by The Incredible String Band. Tennant wrote several of their songs including &quot;Can You Hear the Dawn Break?&quot;, which he regards as his first &#x27;proper&#x27; song. He was also a member of the youth theatre at the People&#x27;s Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne.

===Early career===
In 1975, having completed a degree in history at North London Polytechnic (now part of London Metropolitan University), Tennant worked for two years as the production editor for Marvel UK, the UK branch of Marvel Comics. He was responsible for anglicising the dialogue of Marvel&#x27;s catalogue to suit British readers and for indicating where women needed to be redrawn for the British editions. He also wrote occasional features for the comics, including interviews with pop stars Marc Bolan and Alex Harvey. In 1977, he moved to Macdonald Educational Publishing, where he edited &quot;The Dairy Book of Home Management&quot; (1980) and various illustrated books about cookery, playing the guitar and other home interests. Then he moved to ITV Books, where he edited TV tie-in books. After having commissioned Steve Bush, then the designer of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;The Face&quot;, to design a book about the group Madness, he was offered a job at &quot;Smash Hits&quot; as news editor of the British teen pop magazine in 1982. The following year, he became assistant editor. He also edited &quot;The Smash Hits Yearbook&quot; from 1982 to 1985.

At &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, an opportunity arose for him to go to New York to interview The Police. While there, Tennant arranged to meet Bobby Orlando, a producer whom he and Chris Lowe admired. Tennant mentioned he was writing songs in his spare time, and Orlando agreed to record some tracks with him and Lowe at a later date. Orlando produced the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; first single &quot;West End Girls&quot;.

===Pet Shop Boys===

===Solo appearances===
Alongside his work with Chris Lowe as Pet Shop Boys, Tennant has worked on several side projects including:
* In August 2024, he recited spoken-word lyrics of the song &quot;Why?&quot; by Bronski Beat on a remix by Superchumbo for the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;.
* In June 2024, he appeared on the Michael Berkeley album &quot;Collaborations&quot;, singing &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, a song about Ukraine for which Tennant also wrote the lyrics.
* In 2023, Tennant provided vocals on &quot;Skydive&quot; by UK rapper Casisdead.
* In 2017, Tennant sang a duet with Chrissie Hynde on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Lost&quot;, which originally appeared on the 2016 album &quot;Alone&quot; by The Pretenders.
* In 2014, Tennant provided vocals on &quot;Were You There&quot; by Diamond Version.

==Personal life==
Tennant came out as gay in a 1994 interview in &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine. Otherwise he remains quiet about his personal and romantic life, preferring to be a &quot;man of mystery&quot;, as he states it. He maintains a house in London. He owned a house in County Durham in the countryside of North East England, but has since sold it. He and Lowe also have an apartment in Berlin.

Tennant is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. In 1998, Tennant was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party. However, in the 2005 general election he voted for the Liberal Democrats, citing disillusionment with Labour&#x27;s ID card scheme. The Pet Shop Boys agreed to personal appeals by then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson and then-Prime Minister David Cameron, both prominent Conservative Party politicians, for the group to play at the &quot;winners&#x27; parade&quot; taking place shortly after the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Enjoying the event&#x27;s atmosphere and how their stage presence turned into a well-received performance, Tennant subsequently texted Cameron&#x27;s staff pushing Cameron to use gay scientist Alan Turing&#x27;s centenary year as impetus for the UK Government to formally pardon Turing. The formal pardon did go through on 24 December 2013, with the related official paperwork signed by Queen Elizabeth II.

Tennant has praised the group The Specials and singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, highlighting &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Shipbuilding&quot; as protest songs successfully putting politics into pop music.

He has criticised ageism in the music industry, stating in 2013 that radio professionals would tell him that they want to play Pet Shop Boys songs on the air, but will not because the duo, then in their 50s, were considered to be &quot;too old&quot;.

Actor David Tennant adopted his stage name from Tennant when joining Equity, as another actor was already registered with his birth name, David McDonald.

<text>The Peace of Augsburg (), also called the Augsburg Settlement, was a treaty between Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Schmalkaldic League, signed on 25 September 1555 in the German city of Augsburg. It officially ended the religious struggle between the two groups and made the legal division of Christianity permanent within the Holy Roman Empire, allowing rulers to choose either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism as the official confession of their state. Calvinism was not allowed until the Peace of Westphalia.

The Peace of Augsburg has been described as &quot;the first step on the road toward a European system of sovereign states.&quot; The system, created on the basis of the Augsburg Peace, collapsed at the beginning of the 17th century, which was one of the reasons for the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Overview==
The Peace elaborated the principle &quot;Cuius regio, eius religio&quot; (&quot;whose realm, his religion&quot;), which allowed the princes of states within the Holy Roman Empire to adopt either Lutheranism or Catholicism within the domains they controlled, ultimately reaffirming their sovereignty over those domains. Subjects, citizens, or residents were generally forced to convert to their prince&#x27;s religion, through a principle called &quot;ius reformandi&quot;. Those who did not wish to conform to the prince&#x27;s choice were given a grace period in which they were free to emigrate to different regions in which their desired religion had been accepted. This principle is known as &quot;ius emigrandi&quot;. However, serfs were essentially excluded from this right to emigrate.

Article 24 stated: &quot;In case our subjects, whether belonging Augsburg Confession, should intend leaving their homes with their wives and children to settle in another, they shall be hindered neither in the sale of their estates after due payment of the local taxes nor injured in their honor.&quot;

Charles V had made an interim ruling, the Augsburg Interim of 1548, on the legitimacy of two religious creeds in the empire, and this was codified in law on 30 June 1548 upon the insistence of the emperor, who wanted to work out religious differences under the auspices of a general council of the Catholic Church. The Interim largely reflected principles of Catholic religious behavior in its 26 articles, although it allowed for marriage of the clergy, and the giving of both bread and wine to the laity. This led to resistance by the Protestant territories, who proclaimed their own Interim at Leipzig the following year.

The Interim was overthrown in 1552 by the revolt of the Protestant elector Maurice of Saxony and his allies. In the negotiations at Passau in the summer of 1552, even the Catholic princes had called for a lasting peace, fearing that the religious controversy would never be settled. The emperor, however, was unwilling to recognize the religious division in Western Christendom as permanent. This document was foreshadowed by the Peace of Passau, which in 1552 gave Lutherans religious freedom after a victory by Protestant armies. Under the Passau document, Charles granted a peace only until the next imperial Diet, whose meeting was called in early 1555.

The treaty, negotiated on Charles&#x27; behalf by his brother, Ferdinand, gave Lutheranism official status within the domains of the Holy Roman Empire, according to the policy of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;. Knights and towns who had practiced Lutheranism for some time were exempted under the &quot;Declaratio Ferdinandei&quot;. Conversely, the &quot;Ecclesiastical reservation&quot; prevented the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; from being applied if an ecclesiastical ruler converted to Lutheranism.

In practice the principle of &quot;cuius regio&quot; had already been implemented between the time of the Nuremberg Religious Peace of 1532 and the 1546–1547 Schmalkaldic War. Now legal in the &quot;de jure&quot; sense, it was to apply to all the territories of the Empire except for the Ecclesiastical principalities and some of the cities in those ecclesiastical states, where the question of religion was addressed under the separate principles of the and the , which also formed part of the Peace of Augsburg. This agreement marked the end of the first wave of organized military action between Protestants and Catholics; however, these principles were factors during the wars of the 1545–1648 Counter-Reformation.

This left out Reformed Zwinglians and Anabaptists, but not Calvinists who approved of the Augsburg Confession Variata. Practices other than the two which were the most widespread in the Empire was expressly forbidden, considered by the law to be heretical, and could be punishable by death. Although &quot;cuius regio&quot; did not explicitly intend to allow the modern ideal of &quot;freedom of conscience&quot;, individuals who could not subscribe to their ruler&#x27;s religion were permitted to leave his territory with their possessions. Also under the , Lutheran knights were given the freedom to retain their religion wherever they lived. The revocation of the by the Catholics in the 1629 Edict of Restitution helped fuel the Thirty Years&#x27; War of 1618–1648. The Edict of Restitution itself was overturned in the 1635 Peace of Prague. The following Peace of Westphalia prohibited rulers from force-converting their subjects, overturning the Augsburg principle of &quot;ius reformandi&quot;, and determining the official religion of Imperial territories to the status of 1624 as a normative year. It also allowed for serfs to emigrate, something that the Peace of Augsburg had not confirmed.

Although some dissenters emigrated, others lived as Nicodemites. Because of geographical and linguistic circumstances on the continent of Europe, emigration was more feasible for Catholics living in Protestant lands than for Protestants living in Catholic lands. As a result, there were more crypto-Protestants than crypto-Papists in continental Europe.

==Main principles==

The Peace of Augsburg contained three main principles:

#The principle of (&quot;Whose realm, his religion&quot;) provided for internal religious unity within a state: the religion of the prince (either Lutheranism or Roman Catholicism) became the religion of the state and all its inhabitants. Those inhabitants who could not conform to the prince&#x27;s religion were allowed to leave: an innovative idea in the 16th century. This principle was discussed at length by the various delegates, who finally reached agreement on the specifics of its wording after examining the problem and the proposed solution from every possible angle. Forms of Christianity other than the two specified - notably the emerging faith of Calvinism - were not recognised by the Empire.
#The second principle, called the (ecclesiastical reservation), covered the special status of the ecclesiastical state. If the prelate of an ecclesiastic state changed his religion, the inhabitants of that state did not have to do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post, although this was not spelled out in the agreement. 
#The third principle, known as (Ferdinand&#x27;s Declaration), exempted knights and some of the cities from the requirement of religious uniformity, if the reformed religion had been practiced there since the mid-1520s. This allowed for a few mixed cities and towns where Catholics and Lutherans had lived together. It also protected the authority of the princely families, the knights and some of the cities to determine what religious uniformity meant in their territories. Ferdinand inserted this at the last minute, on his own authority.

The third principle was not publicized as part of the treaty, and was kept secret for almost two decades.

==Problems==
The document left some unresolved problems. While it gave legal basis for the practice of the Lutheran confession, it did not Zwinglianism nor Anabaptism. Although the Peace of Augsburg was moderately successful in relieving tension in the empire and increasing tolerance, it meant that many Protestant groups living in the empire still found themselves in danger of the charge of heresy. (Article 17: &quot;However, all such as do not belong to the two above named religions shall not be included in the present peace but be totally excluded from it.&quot;) These minorities did not achieve any legal recognition until the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. 

Failure to secure a broader peace ultimately led to the Thirty Years&#x27; War. One precursor was the Third Defenestration of Prague (1618) in which two representatives of the fiercely Catholic king of Bohemia, Archduke Ferdinand, were thrown out of a castle window.

==Aftermath==

The principle of ecclesiastical reservation was tested in the Cologne War (1583–1588), which grew out of the scenario envisioned by Ferdinand when he wrote the proviso: the reigning prince-archbishop, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, converted to Protestantism; although he did not insist that the population convert, he placed Calvinism on a parity with Catholicism throughout the Electorate of Cologne. This in itself came forth as a two-fold legal problem: first, Calvinism was considered a heresy; second, the elector did not resign his see, which made him eligible in theory to cast a ballot for emperor. Finally, his marriage raised the possibility of convert the electorate into a dynastic principality, shifting the balance of religious power in the empire, as Protestants could potentially hold a majority of electorates.

A side effect of the religious turmoil was Charles&#x27; decision to abdicate and divide Habsburg territory into two sections. His brother Ferdinand ruled the Austrian lands, and Charles&#x27; fervently Catholic son, Philip II, became administrator of Spain, the Spanish Netherlands, parts of Italy, and other overseas holdings.

<doc id="320622" wikidata="Q737542" url="?curid=320622" title="Genpei War">
<text>The was a national civil war between the Taira and Minamoto clans during the late Heian period of Japan. It resulted in the downfall of the Taira and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate under Minamoto no Yoritomo, who appointed himself as &quot;Shōgun&quot; in 1192, governing Japan as a military dictator from the eastern city of Kamakura.

It followed a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by the Taira in 1179 with the removal of rivals from all government posts, and subsequently banishing them, and a call to arms against the Taira, led by the Minamoto in 1180. The ensuing Battle of Uji took place just outside Kyoto, starting a five-year-long war, concluding with a decisive Minamoto victory in the naval Battle of Dan-no-ura. However, it has been pointed out that the Battle of Ōshū in 1189 was the last battle during this period of civil war, as it completed Yoritomo&#x27;s nationwide domination through the annexation of Northeast Japan.

The name &quot;Genpei&quot; (sometimes romanized as &quot;Gempei&quot;) comes from alternate readings of the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;Minamoto&quot; (源 &quot;Gen&quot;) and &quot;Taira&quot; (平 &quot;Hei&quot;, pronounced as the second element in some compounds as &quot;-pei&quot;). The conflict is also known in Japanese as the , after the two Imperial eras between which it took place. The term &quot;Genpei Kassen&quot; is sometimes used in Japan, but it has been argued that it is not appropriate to use the term &quot;Genpei&quot; for this war.

==Background==
The Genpei War was the culmination of a decades-long conflict between the two aforementioned clans over dominance of the Imperial court and, by extension, control of Japan. In the Hōgen Rebellion and in the Heiji Rebellion of earlier decades, the Minamoto attempted to regain control from the Taira and failed.

In 1180, Taira no Kiyomori put his grandson Antoku (then only 2 years of age) on the throne after the abdication of Emperor Takakura. Emperor Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s son Mochihito felt that he was being denied his rightful place on the throne and, with the help of Minamoto no Yorimasa, sent out a call to arms to the Minamoto clan and Buddhist monasteries in May. However, this plot ended with the deaths of Yorimasa and Mochihito.

In June 1180, Kiyomori moved the seat of imperial power to Fukuhara-kyō, &quot;his immediate objective seems to have been to get the royal family under his close charge.&quot;

==Beginnings of the war==

The actions of Taira no Kiyomori having deepened Minamoto hatred for the Taira clan, a call for arms was sent up by Minamoto no Yorimasa and Prince Mochihito. Not knowing who was behind this rally, Kiyomori called for the arrest of Mochihito, who sought protection at the temple of Mii-dera. The Mii-dera monks were unable to ensure him sufficient protection, so he was forced to move along. He was then chased by Taira forces to the Byōdō-in, just outside Kyoto. The war began thus, with a dramatic encounter on and around the bridge over the River Uji. This battle ended in Yorimasa&#x27;s ritual suicide inside the Byōdō-in and Mochihito&#x27;s capture and execution shortly afterwards.

It was at this point that Minamoto no Yoritomo took over leadership of the Minamoto clan and began traveling the country seeking to rendezvous with allies. Leaving Izu Province and heading for the Hakone Pass, he was defeated by the Taira in the battle of Ishibashiyama. However, he successfully made it to the provinces of Kai and Kōzuke, where the Takeda and other friendly families helped repel the Taira army. Meanwhile, Kiyomori, seeking vengeance against the Mii-dera monks and others, besieged Nara and burnt much of the city to the ground.

Fighting continued the following year, 1181. Minamoto no Yukiie was defeated by a force led by Taira no Shigehira at the Battle of Sunomatagawa. However, the &quot;Taira could not follow up their victory.&quot;

Taira no Kiyomori died from illness in the spring of 1181, and around the same time Japan began to suffer from a famine which was to last through the following year. The Taira moved to attack Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a cousin of Yoritomo who had raised forces in the north, but were unsuccessful. For nearly two years, the war ceased, only to resume in the spring of 1183.

==Turning of the tide==

In 1183, the Taira loss at the Battle of Kurikara was so severe that they found themselves several months later under siege in Kyoto with Yoshinaka approaching the city from the north and Yukiie from the east. Both Minamoto leaders had seen little or no opposition in marching to the capital and now forced the Taira to flee the city. Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori&#x27;s death, led his army, along with the young Emperor Antoku and the Imperial regalia, to the west. The cloistered emperor Go-Shirakawa defected to Yoshinaka. Go-Shirakawa then issued a mandate for Yoshinaka to &quot;join with Yukiie in destroying Munemori and his army&quot;.

In 1183, Yoshinaka once again sought to gain control of the Minamoto clan by planning an attack on Yoritomo, while simultaneously pursuing the Taira westward. The Taira set up a temporary Court at Dazaifu in Kyūshū, the southernmost of Japan&#x27;s main islands. They were forced out soon afterwards by local revolts instigated by Go-Shirakawa, and moved their Court to Yashima. The Taira were successful in beating off an attack by Yoshinaka&#x27;s pursuing forces at the Battle of Mizushima.

Yoshinaka conspired with Yukiie to seize the capital and the Emperor, possibly even establishing a new Court in the north. However, Yukiie revealed these plans to the Emperor, who communicated them to Yoritomo. Betrayed by Yukiie, Yoshinaka took command of Kyoto and, at the beginning of 1184, set fire to the Hōjūjidono, taking the Emperor into custody. Minamoto no Yoshitsune arrived soon afterwards with his brother Noriyori and a considerable force, driving Yoshinaka from the city. After fighting his cousins at the bridge over the Uji, Yoshinaka made his final stand at Awazu, in Ōmi Province. He was defeated by Yoshitsune, and killed while attempting to flee.

==Final stages==
As the united Minamoto forces left Kyoto, the Taira began consolidating their position at a number of sites in and around the Inland Sea, which was their ancestral home territory. They received a number of missives from the Emperor offering that if they surrendered by the seventh day of the second month, the Minamoto could be persuaded to agree to a truce. This was a farce, as neither the Minamoto nor the Emperor had any intentions of waiting until the eighth day to attack. Nevertheless, this tactic offered the Emperor a chance to regain the Regalia and to distract the Taira leadership.

The Minamoto army, led by Yoshitsune and Noriyori, made their first major assault at Ichi-no-Tani, one of the primary Taira camps on Honshū. The camp was attacked from two directions by Yoshitsune and Noriyori, and the Taira not killed or captured retreated to Yashima. However, the Minamoto were not prepared to assault Shikoku; a six-month pause thus ensued during which the Minamoto took the proper steps. Though on the retreat, the Taira enjoyed the distinct advantages of being in friendly, home territories, and of being far more adept at naval combat than their rivals.

It was not until nearly a year after the battle of Ichi-no-Tani that the main Taira force at Yashima came under assault. Seeing Yoshitsune&#x27;s bonfires in their rear, the Taira had not expected a land-based attack and took to their ships. This was a deceptive ploy on the part of the Minamoto, however. The Taira improvised imperial palace fell, and many escaped along with the Imperial regalia and the Emperor Antoku.

The Genpei War came to an end one month later, following the battle of Dan-no-ura, one of the most famous and significant battles in Japanese history. The Minamoto engaged the Taira fleet in the Straits of Shimonoseki, a tiny body of water separating the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū. The tides played a powerful role in the development of the battle, granting the advantage first to the Taira, who were more experienced and abler sailors, and later to the Minamoto. The Minamoto advantage was considerably enhanced by the defection of Taguchi, a Shikoku warrior who went over to the Minamoto side in the middle of the action. Many of the Taira nobles perished, along with Emperor Antoku and the widow of Kiyomori.

==Consequences of the Genpei War==
The defeat of the Taira armies meant the end of Taira &quot;dominance at the capital&quot;. In December 1185, Go-Shirakawa granted to Yoritomo the power to collect taxes, and &quot;appoint stewards and constables in all provinces&quot;. Finally, in 1192, after Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s death, Yoritomo was granted the imperial commission &quot;Sei-i Tai Shōgun&quot;. This was the beginning of a feudal state in Japan, with real power now in Kamakura. However, Kyoto remained the &quot;seat of national ceremony and ritual&quot; and the de jure capital. 

==Aftermath==
The end of the Genpei War and beginning of the Kamakura shogunate marked the rise to power of the warrior class (&quot;samurai&quot;) and the gradual suppression of the power of the emperor, who was compelled to govern without effective political or military power, being effectively reduced to a purely symbolical and ceremonial head of state, until the Meiji Restoration over 650 years later, though there was a short-lived attempt to restore imperial rule in the 1330s, the Kenmu Restoration.

In addition, this war and its aftermath established red and white, the colors of the Taira and Minamoto standards, respectively, as Japan&#x27;s national colors. Today, these colors can be seen on the flag of Japan, and also in banners and flags in sumo and other traditional activities.

== Definition ==

=== Extent ===
It has been pointed out that the Battle of Ōshū fought between the Kamakura government and the Northern Fujiwara in 1189 was in fact the last battle during this period of civil war, as it completed Yoritomo&#x27;s nationwide domination through the annexation of Dewa and Mutsu Province, and that its end marked the establishment of the first military government, the Kamakura shogunate.

=== Name ===
The terms &quot;Genpei Kassen&quot; (源平合戦), &quot;Genpei Sōran&quot; (源平争乱) and &quot;Genpei no Tatakai&quot; (源平の戦い) are sometimes used in Japan, but it has been argued that it is not appropriate to use the term &quot;Genpei&quot; for this war, as it does not accurately represent the belligerents of the war. In fact, the head of the Minamoto clan at the time was not a samurai but a court noble, and the first samurai to be the head of the clan was Ashikaga Yoshimitsu in the 14th century.

In reality, it was not exclusively a war between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan, and there were many members of the Taira clan fighting on Minamoto clan&#x27;s side, as well as members of these two clans serving as court nobles at the Imperial Court that were not samurai and had nothing to do with the war. There is no record of any direct or indirect complicity or assistance by the non-samurai Minamoto and Taira clan members to the war, and no record of any motive for their involvement exists.

Furthermore, the Battle of Ōshū was fought between Minamoto no Yoritomo and his last strong enemy, the Northern Fujiwara, years after the Taira clan had been destroyed.

It is true that many members of the Minamoto clan, such as Takeda Nobuyoshi and Minamoto no Yoshinaka, rose to arms against the Taira clan. There were also many who belonged to the Minamoto clan, but who fought for the Taira clan because they had a kinship or a duty to the Taira clan. Although the various Minamoto clans rose up simultaneously, not all of them were under the command of Minamoto no Yoritomo from the beginning. In fact, the actual Kawachi Genji had no single legitimate lineage, and even if we were to limit ourselves to the succession of Minamoto no Yoshiie, who was the representative samurai of the Kawachi Genji, it was not only Yoritomo who could have claimed that position. Yoritomo was the heir of Yoshitomo, who had risen to that position by killing his father and younger brother during the Battle of Ōkura in 1155. However, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, the heir of Minamoto no Yoshikata, and Yukiie, the younger brother of Yoshitomo and Yoshikata, could have claimed the position as well.

==Major figures==
=== Minamoto Clan (also known as &quot;Genji&quot;) ===

The Minamoto were one of the four great clans that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian period (794–1185). They were, however, decimated by the Taira in the Heiji Rebellion of 1160. Minamoto no Yoshitomo had been the head of the clan at this time; upon his defeat at the hands of Taira no Kiyomori, two of his sons were killed and the third, Minamoto no Yoritomo, was banished. Following the call to arms of Prince Mochihito and Minamoto no Yorimasa in 1180, the clan would gather together and rise to power again. The Genpei war would see the Minamoto clan defeat the Taira and take command of the entire country.

The Taira clan was one of the four great clans which dominated Japanese politics during the Heian period (794–1185). As a result of the near-total destruction of their rival clan, the Minamoto, in the Heiji Rebellion of 1160, Taira no Kiyomori, head of the clan, initiated the Genpei War at the height of his power. The end of the war, however, brought destruction to the Taira clan.

==In literature==

Many stories and works of art depict this conflict. is the most famous, although many kabuki and bunraku plays reproduce events of the war as well. &quot;Ichinotani Futaba Gunki&quot; (&#x27;Chronicle of the battle of Ichi-no-Tani&#x27;) by Namiki Sōsuke may be one of the more famous of these.

The novel &quot;Shike&quot; by Robert Shea features a somewhat fictionalized account of the wars, as seen from the perspectives of his two main characters, the Zinja Monk Jebu, and the Noblewoman Lady Shima Taniko. The names of the two rival clans have been changed, &quot;Minamoto&quot; to &quot;Muratomo&quot; and &quot;Taira&quot; to &quot;Takashi&quot;.

Another fictionalized account of the conflict forms the central plot of &quot;Civil War&quot; (also known as &quot;Turbulent Times&quot;), the ninth volume of Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Phoenix&quot; series of comics.

The Genpei War is the backdrop for much of Katherine Patterson&#x27;s young adult novel, &quot;Of Nightingales That Weep&quot;.

<doc id="320632" wikidata="Q5281988" url="?curid=320632" title="Discovery World">
<text>Discovery World is a science and technology museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Discovery World is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that does not receive any public funding.

== History ==
Founded by Robert Powrie Harland, Sr., Discovery World was initially known as the Science, Economics and Technology Center. Plans for it appeared in the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; in 1981. The museum&#x27;s early location was the Milwaukee Public Library, inside the Wisconsin Ave. entrance of the library. The museum featured hands-on exhibits, computerized simulations, and science shows.

== Exhibits ==

Discovery World contains numerous interactive science, technology, and freshwater exhibits in its 140,000-square foot facility. These exhibits include the following:

=== Great Lakes Future ===
A model of the entire Great Lakes watershed built to scale addresses freshwater issues, stewardship, and the relationship between humans and freshwater resources. It also features an artificially induced weather event. With the push of a button, visitors can call for &quot;rain&quot; to fall down upon this watershed, observing where the water flows and how run-off pollutants navigate the region. The perimeter of the exhibit features several tank habitats. Inhabitants include a Northern Spiny Softshell Turtle, an Ornate Box Turtle, a Three-Toed Box Turtle, a Blanding&#x27;s Turtle, North American Wood Turtles, a Corn Snake, Pumpkinseed, and Bluegill. Several ice-age and prehistoric animal skulls are found throughout the exhibit as well. The permanent exhibit was designed by Grace La and James Dallman of LA DALLMAN and was published in the Berlin monograph &quot;1000x Architecture of the Americas.&quot;

=== Reiman Aquarium ===
The Reiman Aquarium is the largest aquarium in the state of Wisconsin and occupies the lower level of Discovery World. Tank exhibits replicate a wide variety of aquatic habitats, including that of Lake Michigan, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the Caribbean Sea, and much more.

Notable features include a 75,000-gallon Lake Michigan Tank, 65,000-gallon Caribbean Tunnel Tank, and multiple Touch Tanks. The Lake Michigan Tank at the center of the aquarium is home to Lake Sturgeon and many other species native to the Great Lakes. The 65,000-gallon warm saltwater tank is the most colorful and active tank. It is constructed as an upside down halfpipe, which visitors can walk through. This tank is home to a Rooster Hogfish, a Sargassum Triggerfish, Bamboo Sharks, Goatfish, French and Queen Angelfish, a Cownose Stingray, and a variety of Grunts, a Scrawled Filefish.Touch Tanks

There are multiple touch tanks where visitors can have a hands-on interaction with unique aquatic creatures.

A cold freshwater touch tank features young Lake Sturgeon. A much warmer saltwater touch tank features Atlantic Stingray and Cortez Round Stringray. Additionally, an invertebrate tank which is home to Slipper Lobsters.

=== Les Paul’s House of Sound ===
Les Paul&#x27;s House of Sound features three different areas: Les&#x27;s Early Years, The Musician on the Road to Stardom, and Friends of Les Paul. The exhibit includes Paul’s Grammy Awards, the first Gibson guitar Paul produced, and the &quot;Klunker&quot; he used.

=== City of Freshwater &amp; Liquid House ===

This exhibit explains how the water used in homes eventually flows back to Lake Michigan. Other features of this exhibit include a look into Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District processes, Milwaukee Water Works, and Milwaukee’s Deep Tunnel project, which reduces the amount of wastewater dumped into Lake Michigan each year. The permanent exhibit, comprising more than twenty interactive installations, was designed by Grace La and James Dallman of LA DALLMAN.

=== Automation Everywhere ===
This exhibit includes a focus on artificial intelligence, mechanics, and engineering. The Dream Machine allows the public to design products to take home, experience a custom-built automated factory, and learn modern engineering trends. Visitors can operate the controls of the retractable domes of Miller Park and the Milwaukee Art Museum.

=== Other Exhibits ===
Other exhibits at Discovery World include The Challenge (an 88 ft replica of a 19th century schooner), Simple Machine Shipyard, Driving and Flight Simulators, All Aboard, Milwaukee Muscle, Power On, Physics and You, The Innovation Station, Virtual Explorer, Clean Air Trek, BIG, Power On, and The Distant Mirror.

== Experiences ==
Discovery World offers:

* Design It! Lab is a weekend experience of a maker space that offers hands-on projects for all ages.
* Virtual Explorer is a virtual reality experience featuring immersive gameplay and impossible environments.
* Wind Leaves is a permanent group of sculptures in front of Discovery World. It consists of seven tall &quot;leaves&quot; coated in stainless steel disks that reflect the surroundings and react to wind. They are interactive and can be spun by visitors.

== Labs and studios ==
Discovery World has ten educational spaces, that provide opportunities for visitors, school groups, and campers to participate in hands-on experiences focused on creativity, science, technology, and freshwater, especially the Great Lakes. These ten spaces include:

* STEM Lab – provides a panoramic backdrop for exploring STEM topics from cells to chemistry to circuits.

<doc id="320634" wikidata="Q734576" url="?curid=320634" title="Adventures of the Gummi Bears">
<text>Adventures of the Gummi Bears is an American animated children&#x27;s television series created by Jymn Magon and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. The series, loosely inspired by gummy bear candies, takes place in a fantasy world of medieval lands and magic, and focuses on the lives of six mystical beings known as Gummi Bears. The series focuses on the exploits of the main characters, as they tackle a series of problems, as well as aid their human friends and thwart the plans of various evil characters. Episodes consisted of either a single story, or two 11-minute stories.

The lavishly budgeted series became iconic for not only spearheading the style of Disney animated series that followed, but also starting an era of artistic improvement in television animation spurred on its success with competitors forced to improve their own artistic standards to avoid unfavorable comparisons. The series was known for various elements, including its signature potion known as &quot;gummiberry juice&quot;, and the theme music - written by Michael and Patty Silversher, performed by Joseph Williams. The animated series first premiered in the United States, running for six seasons between 1985 and 1991, with the show later sold to other countries including the United Kingdom.

==Premise== 
&quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; takes place in a medieval fairy tale world and focuses on a group of six &quot;Gummi Bears&quot;, a race of anthropomorphic bears with great skills in magic and technology. The group lives in the underground secret settlement of Gummi Glen within the forest of the kingdom of Dunwyn. Long ago, the Gummi Bears had a powerful and highly developed civilization, but were persecuted by human armies who sought access to the Gummi Bears&#x27; knowledge and ultimately drove almost all Gummi Bears north. Most of the Gummi Bears then settled on a continent unknown to humans and were forgotten over time. They are now generally considered a legend by humans, but few know that they still exist. Throughout the Gummi Bears&#x27; search for their heritage, old ruins and intact buildings with some high-tech devices are repeatedly discovered.

Despite their efforts to continue living free from human influence and safe from threats, the bears of Gummi Glen gradually encounter several humans. Contrary to all fears and prejudices, the encounters do not always result in confrontation and fighting; while most humans dismiss every encounter as an illusion and put it out of their mind, some humans (especially children) try to befriend the Gummi Bears. Only those who still believe in and know about the Gummi Bears and their magic try to capture them. The Gummi Bears&#x27; closest friends among humans are Princess Calla, the daughter of King Gregor and heir to Dunwyn&#x27;s throne, and Cavin, the squire of Gregor&#x27;s chief knight Sir Tuxford.

The Gummi Bears owe their name to a magic potion named &quot;Gummiberry Juice&quot;, which allows them to bounce like a rubber ball. Gummiberry Juice is made by Grammi Gummi using an ancient and secret recipe from the Gummiberries that grow in the Dunwyn forest. The Gummiberry Juice gives humans and monsters superhuman strength for a short time, but unlike Gummi Bears, it only works on humans once a day. The evil and power-hungry Duke Igthorn is constantly trying to obtain the formula of the potion and the remaining secrets of the Gummi Bears with his servant Toadwart and his private army of simple-minded ogres. He seeks to conquer Dunwyn, dethrone the king and establish a reign of terror. The Gummi Bears often have to intervene - albeit secretly - to protect the king, their friends and their secrets from the machinations of Igthorn and other enemies.

==Characters==

* Zummi Gummi (voiced by Paul Winchell in Seasons 1-5 and Jim Cummings in Season 6) is an aged bear who is the Gummi Glen leader, caretaker of Gummi Bear knowledge and wisdom, and a modest magician. He is somewhat forgetful with spells, speaking occasionally with mild spoonerisms, and having a fear of heights.
* Gruffi Gummi (voiced by Bill Scott in Season 1 and Corey Burton in Seasons 2-6) is Gummi Glen&#x27;s grumpy and conservative craftsman and mechanic. He is the voice of reason and a sound strategist for the group, though his perfectionism regularly becomes his downfall.
* Grammi Gummi (voiced by June Foray) is the matriarch of Gummi Glen, responsible for cooking for the group, housework in their home, and preparing Gummiberry Juice through the secret recipe passed down to her.
* Tummi Gummi (voiced by Lorenzo Music) is an overweight Gummi Bear cub, and the eldest of the three in the group. He is relaxed, easygoing, and harbors a great love of food, but has remarkable (if mostly hidden) technical skills and good comprehension, and often behaves impartially in disputes or acts as an arbitrator.
* Sunni Gummi (voiced by Katie Leigh) is an excitable and naive preteen Gummi Bear cub who exhibits a keen interest in human culture and fashion rather than in Gummi history.
* Cubbi Gummi (voiced by Noelle North) is a young Gummi Bear cub, the youngest of the three in Gummi Glen, who dreams of becoming a knight. He is characterized as being adventurous and somewhat impetuous, but with an open-mindedness to finding solutions to problems he faces.
* Cavin (voiced by Christian Jacobs in Season 1, Brett Johnson in Season 2, David Faustino in Season 3; Jason Marsden in Seasons 4 &amp; 5 and R.J. Williams in Season 6) is a young boy, serving as a page and squire in Dunwyn Castle. Cavin is the first human to encounter the Gummi Bears, and befriends them as a result of possessing a Gummi medallion that he leaves with Zummi, becoming friends with Cubbi over time. The character is portrayed in the series as courageous and good-hearted.
* Princess Calla (voiced by Noelle North) is a princess of Dunwyn, who is defiantly adventurous, capable of defending herself, despite her dislike of her circumstances and royal duties. She is friends with Cavin, and also becomes friends with Sunni after meeting the Gummi Bears during the first season.
* King Gregor (voiced by Michael Rye) is the king of Dunwyn, characterized as a benevolent, brave, and good ruler for his people. Like most humans, he believes Gummi Bears are myths, and thus does not know of their actions helping to protect his kingdom. However, he does discover his daughter&#x27;s previously hidden fighting prowess towards the end of the series and is deeply impressed by her.
* Sir Tuxford (voiced by Bill Scott in Season 1, Roger C. Carmel in Season 2 and Brian Cummings in Seasons 3-6) is the highest ranking knight of King Gregor&#x27;s court and his trusted friend, as well as Cavin&#x27;s superior. Tuxford is characterized as being an old, jolly man despite being somewhat past his prime for battle.
* Duke Sigmund Igthorn (voiced by Michael Rye) is a disgraced knight of Dunwyn, exiled for conspiring against King Gregor, who leads an army of ogres to attack the kingdom from his fortress of Castle Drekmore. Characterized as a vengeful, power-crazed tyrant, he is the main antagonist of the series. A common element in stories he is involved in is his desire to find a suitable weapon for his plans, as well as capturing Gummi Bears for their Juice.
* Toadwart (voiced by Bill Scott in Season 1 and Corey Burton in Seasons 2-6) is a midget ogre, who serves as Igthorn&#x27;s illeist lieutenant and second-in-command, often nicknamed Toadie. He is characterized as being smarter than other ogres, due to his ability to read and write. Affectionately sycophantic to the Duke, if only because associating with the Duke gives him some authority over the ogres, who otherwise casually abuse him for fun.
* Augustus &quot;Gusto&quot; Gummi (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is an artistic Gummi Bear, stranded on a deserted island with his friend Artie Deco, a wise-talking toucan (voiced by Jymn Magon in his debut episode, Brian Cummings for the rest of the series), before taking residence near to Gummi Glen and aiding the other Gummi Bears when needed. Augusto is characterized as being an individualist with an outside-the-box problem solving ability.
* Lady Bane (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a human sorceress of considerable power, who maintains her youth magically and desires all of Gummi Bear magic for herself. She resembles and based on Disney’s Snow White nemesis Queen.
* Sir Thornberry (voiced by Walker Edmiston) is an aged Gummi Bear knight who acts as the caretaker of the otherwise isolated Gummi Bear city of Ursalia. His manner is eccentric by a probable combination of his extended isolation and senility, but still capable within his mental limits.
* Ursa (voiced by Pat Musick) is the statuesque female leader of the Barbics, a barbarian tribe of Gummi Bears driven from their native lands by humans and are scornful of orthodox Gummi traditions. She and her tribe take up residence in Ursalia at the Gummi Glen Gummies and Sir Thornberry&#x27;s invitation.

The series premiered on NBC on September 14, 1985, and aired there for four seasons. The series moved to ABC (later acquired by Disney in 1996) for one season from 1989 to 1990 (airing alongside &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; as the &quot;Gummi Bears-Winnie the Pooh Hour&quot;) and concluded on September 6, 1991, as part of the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon. The series was later rebroadcast on the Disney Afternoon block and rerun on that block through the summer of 1991. In later years, reruns were shown on The Disney Channel from October 7, 1991 to at least January 1997, and later on Toon Disney, with its most recent televised airing occurring on December 28, 2001.

==Legacy==

&quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; was Disney&#x27;s first major serialized animated television series (it was released back to back with another show, &quot;The Wuzzles&quot;, which lasted only 13 episodes), and is often credited as having helped jump start the television animation boom of the late 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, it also became the forerunner to Disney&#x27;s famous Disney Afternoon timeslot, which gave way to other famous serialized Disney television series, such as &quot;DuckTales&quot;, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot; and &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. Although many of these subsequently-created shows exceeded &quot;Gummi Bears&quot; in budget and length, the show is often credited as a sort of prototype for all of the animation which followed it.

The show was so successful in the United Kingdom that the episodes &quot;A New Beginning&quot; and &quot;Faster Than a Speeding Tummi&quot; were released as theatrical featurettes there in 1986 and 1987, alongside &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; and a re-release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

Appearances of Gummi Bears in other media include one of Gruffi Gummi in a D-TV music video of the Elvis Presley song &quot;Teddy Bear&quot;, in 1986.

The show&#x27;s popularity led to a re-theming of Disneyland&#x27;s Motor Boat Cruise, along with a small part of Disneyland that became known as &quot;Disney Afternoon Avenue&quot;. The Motor Boat Cruise became the &quot;Motor Boat Cruise to Gummi Glen&quot; and plywood characters from the show made Gummiberry Juice along the waterway. The Gummi Bears have been featured as meetable characters who greet guests in Disney theme parks.

<doc id="320635" wikidata="Q7225605" url="?curid=320635" title="Pollenizer">
<text>A pollenizer (or polleniser), sometimes pollinizer (or polliniser, ), is a plant that provides pollen.

The word &quot;pollinator&quot; is often used when &quot;pollenizer&quot; is more precise. A pollinator is the biotic agent that moves the pollen, such as bees, moths, bats, and birds. Bees are thus often referred to as &#x27;pollinating insects&#x27;.

The verb form &quot;to pollenize&quot; is to be the source of pollen, or to be the sire of the next plant generation.

While some plants are capable of self-pollenization, &quot;pollenizer&quot; is more often used in pollination management for a plant that provides abundant, compatible, and viable pollen at the same flowering time as the pollinated plant. For example, most crabapple varieties are good pollenizers for any apple tree that blooms at the same time, and are often used in apple orchards for the purpose. Some apple cultivars produce very little pollen or pollen that is sterile or incompatible with other apple varieties. These are poor pollenizers.

A pollenizer can also be the male plant in dioecious species (where entire plants are of a single sex), such as with kiwifruit or holly.

Nursery catalogs often specify that a cultivar should be planted as a &quot;pollinator&quot; for another cultivar, when they actually should be referring to it as a &quot;pollenizer&quot;. Strictly, a plant can only be a pollinator when it is self-fertile and it physically pollinates itself without the aid of an external pollinator.

The morphism &quot;f&quot; is called a constant morphism (or sometimes left zero morphism) if for any object &quot;W&quot; in C and any , &quot;fg&quot; = &quot;fh&quot;. Dually, &quot;f&quot; is called a coconstant morphism (or sometimes right zero morphism) if for any object &quot;Z&quot; in C and any &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;gf&quot; = &quot;hf&quot;. A zero morphism is one that is both a constant morphism and a coconstant morphism.

A category with zero morphisms is one where, for every two objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in C, there is a fixed morphism 0&quot;AB&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, and this collection of morphisms is such that for all objects &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot; in C and all morphisms &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;g&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;, the following diagram commutes:

The morphisms 0&quot;XY&quot; necessarily are zero morphisms and form a compatible system of zero morphisms.

If C is a category with zero morphisms, then the collection of 0&quot;XY&quot; is unique.

This way of defining a &quot;zero morphism&quot; and the phrase &quot;a category with zero morphisms&quot; separately is unfortunate, but if each hom-set has a unique &quot;zero morphism&quot;, then the category &quot;has zero morphisms&quot;.

== Examples ==
==Related concepts==
If C has a zero object 0, given two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in C, there are canonical morphisms &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → 0 and &quot;g&quot; : 0 → &quot;Y&quot;. Then, &quot;gf&quot; is a zero morphism in MorC(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;). Thus, every category with a zero object is a category with zero morphisms given by the composition 0&quot;XY&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → 0 → &quot;Y&quot;.

If a category has zero morphisms, then one can define the notions of kernel and cokernel for any morphism in that category.

<text>Glasgow Queen Street () is a passenger railway terminus serving the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland. It is the smaller of the city&#x27;s two mainline railway terminals (the larger being Glasgow Central) and is the third-busiest station in Scotland behind Central and Edinburgh Waverley ().

The station serves mainly destinations in the Central Belt and Highlands of Scotland, with Glasgow Central covering destinations in the Lowlands of Scotland, and cross-border services into England. Major lines on the station&#x27;s terminal high-level platforms include the Glasgow-Edinburgh via Falkirk line to Edinburgh Waverley, the principal and fastest route from Glasgow-Edinburgh. Other lines include the West Highland Line for services to and from Oban, Fort William and Mallaig, as well as the Highland Main Line and Glasgow–Dundee line for services to Stirling, Perth, Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen. On the station&#x27;s through low-level platforms is the suburban North Clyde line, running West to Milngavie, Dumbarton, Balloch and Helensburgh, and East to Springburn, Airdrie, Bathgate and Edinburgh Waverley (although this is slower than the line via Falkirk).

The station is located between George Street to the south and Cathedral Street Bridge to the north and is at the northern end of Queen Street adjacent to George Square, Glasgow&#x27;s major civic square. It is also a short walk from Buchanan Street, Glasgow&#x27;s main shopping district and the location of Buchanan Street subway station, the closest connection to Queen Street for the Glasgow Subway network.

The station underwent major redevelopment works by Network Rail in the late 2010s. In October 2017, a £120 million project began on bringing the station up to modern standards, demolishing many of the 1960s buildings and replacing them with a new station concourse, which was completed in 2021.

==History==

The station was built by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and opened on 21 February 1842 as Dundas Street Station before being renamed as Queen Street. Despite opening in 1842, the train shed (curved glass roof) wasn&#x27;t completed until 1878, over three decades later. In 1865 the E&amp;GR was absorbed into the North British Railway, in 1878 the entire station was redesigned by the civil engineer James Carswell. Carswell introduced electric lighting at the station, which was one of the earliest examples of electricity use in Glasgow. It became part of the LNER group in 1923.

The climb through the tunnel to Cowlairs is at 1 in 42 and until 1909 trains were hauled up on a rope operated by a stationary engine, although experiments were carried out using banking engines in 1844–48. Three people died in 1928 when a train leaving the station rolled back into another train. Modern diesel and electric trains have no difficulty with the climb.

The adjacent station of the rival Caledonian Railway closed on 7 November 1966 as a result of the Beeching cuts and its services to Stirling, Perth, Inverness, Dundee and Aberdeen transferred to Queen Street. This caused difficulties with longer trains, as Queen Street is in a confined position between George Square and the tunnel. Buchanan Street was demolished the following year in 1967.

In the 1980s, HSTs were used on Cross Country and East Coast services run by InterCity, having to use Platform 7 with the end of the train being close to the tunnel mouth.

Minor refurbishments of the station took place throughout the 2000s, which saw the station internally repainted and paved with new flooring, and the CRT screens that displayed train timetables and passenger information replaced with new LED information boards similar to those in Glasgow Central Station but smaller, in January 2008. The station received new Eco LED screens provided by Infotec Displays in 2020.

In 2009, the Scottish Government announced that the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line would be electrified by 2017. Overhead line electrification lines have been installed on the high level platforms of Queen Street, with Class 380 trains now operating from the station as of December 2017, and Class 385 trains as of Autumn 2018. As part of this work, the High Level station was closed for 20 weeks (from 20 March to 8 August 2016) to allow of track in Queen Street Tunnel (and all of the tracks and platforms in the station itself) to be replaced. Services were diverted over various routes during this period, with some trains running to/from the Low Level station and others to/from Glasgow Central station (via Cumbernauld, Coatbridge and Carmyle).

=== Expansion ===

In August 2006, Network Rail revealed that it intended to redevelop Queen Street substantially, making use of the Hanover Street car park area to provide more retail space, and to upgrade the station&#x27;s entrances and to provide escalators down to the lower-level platforms. More plans were unveiled in September 2011 by Network Rail, along with an announcement that the owner of the Buchanan Galleries shopping mall – Land Securities had been chosen as development partner for the station alongside Henderson Group. This saw the 1970s hotel extension (which until recently fronted the George Square entrance of the station) demolished and replaced by a glass atrium. The previous plans of developing the airspace rights above the North Hanover Street car park into an expanded retail and restaurant area will be carried forward – and will form part of the proposed extension to the Buchanan Galleries, which will gain direct access to the station concourse.

In August 2017, work began on the £120 million redevelopment of the station, which at the time was expected to be completed by December 2019, but was pushed back until 2020 due to delays in receiving power to go forward with the work. Platforms 2 through 5 were subsequently extended in 2019 to accommodate longer trains introduced as part of the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP). Demolition of surrounding buildings was completed in October 2018 to accommodate the lengthened platforms and an expanded concourse.

Following demolition of the surrounding Consort House buildings, the frontage of the original Victorian era train shed (the large curved glass roof of the station) was uncovered after more than 40 years. The shed is a Category A Listed Structure, and subsequently work on the station was undertaken with care to integrate the historic structure into its new surroundings.

The work was officially completed on 4 October 2021. This also marks the end of EGIP. In September 2024, the expansion project won an industry award, with judges praising the &quot;station&#x27;s striking design and the recent integration of the high and low-level stations&quot;.

In May 2021, a planning proposal was submitted to add a new plaza and mezzanine on the North Hanover Street side of the station. , the decision is still pending.

=== Accidents and incidents ===

* On 24 January 1912, at 14:15, shunter W Wylie was crushed between a train and the platform at Glasgow Queen Street railway station. He succumbed to his injuries two days later.
* On 29 April 1914, at 11.45 am, Porter John Burke was killed whilst he and a colleague were filling lavatory water tanks on passenger coaches. He was crushed between the buffers of two coaches on the adjacent line.

==Services==
Queen Street station&#x27;s platforms are on two levels, with the high-level platforms running directly north–south and the low-level running east–west. They are connected by staircases at either end of the low-level platforms and by lifts accessible from platform 7 on the high level. All services except the Caledonian Sleeper are operated by Scotrail. 
As of May 2024, the off-peak Monday to Friday service in trains per hour (tph) or trains per day (tpd) is:

High-Level:

* 4 tph to Edinburgh Waverley via Croy and Falkirk High
* 1 tph to Cumbernauld via Springburn
* 1 tph to Falkirk Grahamston via Springburn and Cumbernauld
* 1 tph to Anniesland via Maryhill
* 6 tpd to Oban via Crianlarich and Dalmally
* 4 tpd to Mallaig via Crianlarich and Fort William (2 tpd terminating at Fort William) 
* 2 tph to Alloa via Croy and Stirling
* 1 tph to Aberdeen via Stirling, Perth and Dundee
* 1 tph to Dundee via Stirling and Perth
* 1tp2h to Inverness via Stirling, Perth and Aviemore

* 2 tph to Springburn via Bellgrove and Barnhill
* 1 tpd (except Saturday night) to Fort William via Crianlarich (Caledonian Sleeper)

===High level===

The High Level station is the larger of the two levels; it is the terminus for the Edinburgh via Falkirk services and all routes north of the Central Belt run by ScotRail. The high level railway approaches the station building through the Queen Street Tunnel, which runs beneath the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre to the Sighthill area north-east of the city centre. Platforms 1–7 occupy the High Level, platform 1 being at the western end of the trainshed and being considerably shorter; it is usually only used for local stopping services. Since the electrification of several of the routes from the High level station (Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High, and to Stirling, Dunblane and Alloa), the fleet is largely electric, using the new Class 385 trains.

===Low level===

Platforms 8 and 9 comprise the Low Level station and it is the most central stop on the North Clyde Line of the Glasgow suburban electric network. Trains run frequently between Helensburgh on the Firth of Clyde, Balloch and suburban Milngavie to Airdrie, on the eastern edge of the Greater Glasgow conurbation and onward to Edinburgh via Bathgate and Livingston. The line is electrified; the fleet operating this route are Class 318s, Class 320s and Class 334s.

Services on the West Highland Line to Oban, Fort William and Mallaig occasionally use the Low Level station when the main route into the High Level is unavailable due to engineering work. As of September 2014, the to overnight sleeper also calls here instead of in the north-western suburbs; this eliminates the need for those travelling between Glasgow &amp; Fort William and between Glasgow &amp; London Euston on the sleeper to change there. These services are pick up only northbound and drop off passengers only northbound, meaning passengers cannot use these trains to travel from Glasgow Queen Street to London Euston, with an alternative sleeper service available from Glasgow Central instead. This is the only locomotive-hauled train to call here. The Low Level line between High Street, Queen Street and Charing Cross was built before the Glasgow Subway, making it the oldest underground railway in the city. In May–June 2014, work was carried out to redevelop the Low Level platforms, which now have new compliant seating.

==Signalling==

Queen Street signal box, opened in 1881, was on a gantry spanning the tracks close to the tunnel mouth. It closed on 26 February 1967 when control of the high level station was transferred to a panel in Cowlairs signal box. That box was superseded by the new Cowlairs signalling centre on 28 December 1998. This in turn was abolished in October 2013 and the station is now under the supervision of Edinburgh IECC (which will eventually become the Edinburgh Rail Operating Centre).

The low level station had two signal boxes, &#x27;Queen Street West&#x27; and &#x27;Queen Street East&#x27;. Both boxes were over the tracks and closed on 8 February 1960. The low level lines came under the control of Yoker Signalling Centre (IECC) on 19 November 1989.

==Proposals==
Various schemes to link Queen Street to station have been considered, as passengers travelling from the north of Scotland to the south and vice versa via Glasgow have to traverse the city centre either on foot or by road. A bus link connects the two stations (which also calls at the city&#x27;s Buchanan bus station), use of which is free to rail passengers making a cross-Glasgow transfer on a through ticket. Neither of Glasgow&#x27;s main line terminals is directly served by the Glasgow Subway, although a moving walkway was installed between Queen Street and the immediately adjacent subway station during the system&#x27;s modernisation in 1980. Planned expansion work of Buchanan Galleries Shopping Centre is expected to &quot;subtly envelope&quot; the Subway connection to redevelop the neglected Dundas Street.

One option to allow cross-Glasgow rail journeys would be Crossrail Glasgow, using a former passenger line (now used only for freight) that links High Street to the Gorbals area. This initiative was reviewed favourably, but progress has been stalled indefinitely as of 2009. Alternative proposals envisage a new city centre station (possibly in a tunnel underneath the city centre) or a light rail / metro system.

The Glasgow Connectivity Commission, established by the Glasgow City Council in 2017, has proposed the construction of a cross-city centre tunnel akin to the Stockholm City Line to connect the two termini. If the plans are approved, a new intermediate underground station will also be built.

<text> was a papal bull issued on February 5, 1296, by Pope Boniface VIII in an attempt to prevent the secular states of Europein particular France and Englandfrom appropriating church revenues without the express prior permission of the pope. The two expansionist monarchies had come to blows, and the precedents for taxation of the clergy for a &quot;just war&quot; if it was declared a crusade and authorized by the papacy had been well established. The position of Boniface was that prior authorization had always been required and that the clergy had not been taxed for purely secular and dynastic warfare.

==Background==
Boniface VIII viewed conflict between England and France as a particularly grave matter. As long as France was at war, it was less likely to be able to offer him any assistance in Italy, and both were unlikely to participate in any expedition to the Holy Land. The hostilities with France also brought increased exactions on the English church to finance them. Benedict sent cardinal nuncios to each court in hope of a brokered truce, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

At a time when the laity were taxed an eleventh on their movable goods, or a seventh if they lived in town or on a royal demesne, the clergy, under Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Winchelsey, offered a tenth for national defense. King Edward I declined and suggested rather a quarter or a third.

The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 reiterated a principle, found in the Lateran Council of 1179, that a secular power might not tax Church property without first obtaining permission from the pope. It had become accepted practice. PhilipIV had himself observed it in 1288 in collecting a tenth over three years. With the war with EdwardI, however, he dispensed with the formality in his new and so triggered protests from the French clergy and complaints to Rome.

==Content== 
The bull decreed that all prelates or other ecclesiastical superiors who under whatsoever pretext or color shall not, without authority from the Holy See, pay to laymen any part of their income or of the revenue of the Church, likewise all emperors, kings, dukes, counts, etc. who shall exact or receive such payments, incur &quot;eo ipso&quot; the sentence of excommunication.

James F. Loughlin, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1903), sees this as expressing two underlying principles: (1) That the clergy should enjoy equally with the laity the right of determining the need and the amount of their subsidies to the Crown; and (2) That the head of the Church ought to be consulted when there was question of diverting the revenues of the Church to secular purposes.

The bull was criticized for the vehemence of its tone and exaggerated indictment of the laity of all times. Its opening statement asserted that &quot;the laity have been from the most ancient times hostile to the clergy&quot;, which even modern scholars have called &quot;a palpable untruth&quot; given the enormous enthusiasm and devotion most laymen were still showing to many of the clergy. The bull was also attacked for its failure to make clear the distinction between the revenues of the purely ecclesiastical benefices and the &quot;lay fees&quot; held by the clergy on feudal tenure. The advisers of Philip were quick to take advantage of the Pope&#x27;s hasty language and, by forcing him to make explanations, put him on the defensive and weakened his prestige.

 was a reminder of the traditional principle. Surprised by the strong reaction of the French crown and pressure from the French bishops seeking a compromise, in July 1297 Boniface issued another bull, , which allowed lay taxation of clergy without papal consent in cases of emergency.

Nonetheless, was included by Pope Boniface in his collection of canon law, the . Only after the death of Boniface&#x27;s successor, Benedict XI, would the canonists begin treating the bull as truly revoked.

==&quot;Etsi de statu&quot;==
 was a papal bull issued by Pope Boniface VIII in July 1297. The bull was essentially a revocation of , which had fully prohibited the taxation of clerical property by lay authorities without the explicit consent of the papacy. allowed it in cases of emergency.

 had been chiefly directed at EdwardI of England and PhilipIV of France, who had levied taxes on the clergy to finance their war over control of Duchy of Aquitaine. France had responded, however, with an embargo on export of gold or silver, effectively prohibiting Rome from accessing any of its revenues from France. At the same time, Boniface had to contend in Rome with a suspiciously convenient uprising against him by the Colonna family. The Pope was obliged to back down and issue the more accommodating .

<text>The Salzburg Festival () is a prominent festival of music and drama established in 1920. It is held each summer, for five weeks starting in late July, in Salzburg, Austria, the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart&#x27;s operas are a focus of the festival; one highlight is the annual performance of Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Jedermann&quot; (&quot;Everyman&quot;).

Since 1967, an annual Salzburg Easter Festival has also been held, organized by a separate organization.

==History==
Music festivals were held in Salzburg at irregular intervals since 1877 by the International Mozarteum Foundation but were discontinued in 1910. A festival was planned for 1914, but it was cancelled at the outbreak of World War I. In 1917, Friedrich Gehmacher and Heinrich Damisch formed an organization known as the &quot;Salzburger Festspielhaus-Gemeinde&quot; to establish an annual festival of drama and music, emphasizing especially the works of Mozart. At the close of the war in 1918, the festival&#x27;s revival was championed by five men now regarded as its founders: the poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal, the composer Richard Strauss, the scenic designer Alfred Roller, the conductor Franz Schalk, and the director Max Reinhardt, then intendant of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, who had produced the first performance of Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Jedermann&quot; at the Berlin Zirkus Schumann arena in 1911.

According to Hofmannsthal&#x27;s political writings, the Salzburg Festival, as a counterpart to the Prussian-North German uncompromising worldview, should emphasize the centuries-old Habsburg principles of &quot;live and let live&quot; with regard to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages. The Salzburg Festival was officially inaugurated on 22 August 1920 with Reinhardt&#x27;s performance of Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Jedermann&quot; on the steps of Salzburg Cathedral, starring Alexander Moissi. The practice has become a tradition, and the play is now always performed at Cathedral Square; since 1921 it has been accompanied by several performances of chamber music and orchestral works. The first operatic production came in 1922, with Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; conducted by Richard Strauss. The singers were mainly drawn from the Wiener Staatsoper, including Richard Tauber in the part of Don Ottavio.


The first festival hall was erected in 1925 at the former Archbishops&#x27; horse stables on the northern foot of the Mönchsberg mountain, on the basis of plans by Clemens Holzmeister; it opened with Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; dramatized by Karl Vollmöller. At that time the festival had already developed a large-scale program including live broadcasts by the Austrian RAVAG radio network. The following year the adjacent former episcopal &quot;Felsenreitschule&quot; riding academy, carved into the Mönchsberg rock face, was converted into a theater, inaugurated with a performance of &quot;The Servant of Two Masters&quot; by Carlo Goldoni. In the 21st century, the original festival hall, suitable only for concerts, was reconstructed as a third venue for fully staged opera and concert performances and reopened in 2006 as the Haus für Mozart (House for Mozart).

During the years from 1934 to 1937, famed conductors such as Arturo Toscanini and Bruno Walter conducted many performances. In 1936, the festival featured a performance by the Trapp Family Singers, whose story was later depicted in the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (featuring a scene of the Trapp Family singing at the &quot;Felsenreitschule&quot;, but inaccurately set in 1938). In 1937, Boyd Neel and his orchestra premiered Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge&quot; at the festival.

The festival&#x27;s popularity suffered a major blow as a consequence of the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938. Toscanini resigned in protest, artists of Jewish descent like Reinhardt and Georg Solti had to emigrate, and &quot;Jedermann&quot;, last performed by Attila Hörbiger, had to be dropped. Nevertheless, the festival remained in operation until in 1944 it was cancelled by the order of Reich Minister Joseph Goebbels in reaction to the 20 July plot. At the end of World War II, the Salzburg Festival reopened in summer 1945 immediately after the Allied victory in Europe.

==Post World War II festivals==

The post-war festival slowly regained its prominence as a summer opera festival, especially for works by Mozart, with conductor Herbert von Karajan becoming artistic director in 1956. In 1960 the Great Festival Hall (&quot;Großes Festspielhaus&quot;) opera house opened its doors. As this summer festival gained fame and stature as a venue for opera, drama, and classical concert presentation, its musical repertoire concentrated on Mozart and Strauss, but other works, such as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, were also performed.

Upon Karajan&#x27;s death in 1989, the festival was drastically modernized and expanded by director Gerard Mortier, who was succeeded by Peter Ruzicka in 2001.

==21st century==

In 2006, the festival was led by intendant Jürgen Flimm and concert director Markus Hinterhäuser. That year, Salzburg celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth by staging all 22 of his operatic works, including two unfinished operas. All 22 were filmed and released on DVD in November 2006. The 2006 festival also saw the opening of the Haus für Mozart.

In 2010, the opera &quot;Dionysos&quot; by Wolfgang Rihm who compiled for his own libretto texts from Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Dionysian-Dithyrambs&quot; premiered. Alexander Pereira succeeded Flimm as intendant, who departed in 2011 to become director of the Berlin State Opera. Pereira&#x27;s objective for the festival was to present only new productions. When he resigned at the end of the 2014 festival season to take over as the General Director of La Scala, Sven-Eric Bechtolf, who had served as Drama Director of the Salzburg Festival since 2012, took over as Interim General Manager. The 2015 festival marked the first one for which Bechtolf was responsible for the artistic programming. Budget cuts led to a retreat from Pereira&#x27;s &quot;new productions only&quot; objective. The 2015 opera program presented only three new productions—&quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, directed by Bechtolf; &quot;Fidelio&quot;, directed by Claus Guth; and Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s rarely performed &quot;Die Eroberung von Mexico&quot; (The Conquest of Mexico), directed by Peter Konwitschny. The remaining four opera productions—&quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;, and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;—were revivals. In 2018, Lydia Steier was the first woman to stage &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;.

Markus Hinterhäuser became &quot;Intendant&quot; of the Festival in 2016. In April 2024, the Festival announced an extension of Hinterhäuser&#x27;s contract as &quot;Intendant&quot; through 2031.

===Economy===
The Salzburg Festival reports in 2017 ticket sales revenue of about €27 million, and directly and indirectly creates value to the sum of €183 million in Salzburg per year. The festival thereby secures employment in Salzburg (including year-round employees and full-time equivalent adjusted seasonal workers of the festival) of 2800 full-time jobs (Austria 3400). Through their effect in other sectors, directly and indirectly they provide the public sector with approximately €77 million of taxes and duties.

==Whitsun Festival==


The Salzburg Whitsun Festival () is held every year over Pentecost (Whitsun) weekend in late May or early June, organised by the Salzburger Festspielfonds since 1998. It takes place at the Great Festival Theatre and the Haus für Mozart. It was created in 1973 by Herbert von Karajan, at the time as a complement to the Salzburg Easter Festival and called the Salzburg Whitsun Concerts (). When taken over by the summer festival, it was augmented with an opera performance, and given a focus on the baroque and classical periods, which are not traditionally played in Salzburg. Since 2012, its artistic director has been the Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who also performs as the female lead. 

The Whitsun opera production has often been revived a few weeks later at the summer festival; this became standard practice under Bartoli.

<text>is a subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. It was renamed from the earlier Abashiri Subprefecture on April 1, 2010. Abashiri Subprefecture was established in 1897.

==Etymology==
Abashiri Prefecture was named after the subprefectural office in Abashiri. However, the area was more commonly referred to as the , as it faces the Sea of Okhotsk, and the name Abashiri was changed to the more commonly used Okhotsk during the administrative redivision of Hokkaido&#x27;s 14 subprefectures to 9 subprefectural bureaus in April, 2010. The sea is named for the port of Okhotsk, itself named for the Okhota, whose name is derived from the Even word &quot;окат&quot; (okat) meaning &quot;river&quot;.

<doc id="320674" wikidata="Q297086" url="?curid=320674" title="Alexander I of Macedon">
<text>Alexander I (; died 454 BC), also known as Alexander the Philhellene (; ), was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia from 498/497 BC until his death in 454 BC. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Perdiccas II.

== Biography ==

Alexander was the only son of Amyntas I and an unknown spouse, whose name was perhaps Eurydice. He had a sister named Gygaea ().

According to Herodotus, Alexander married his sister to the Persian general Bubares while a vassal of the Achaemenid Empire as a bribe to cover up his murder of a Persian embassy. However, this story is widely regarded as a fiction invented by Herodotus or, at least, hearsay from his time spent in Macedonia. It is more likely that Amyntas arranged the marriage himself around 510, or that Alexander handled it after his father died.

Alexander came to the throne during the era of the kingdom&#x27;s vassalage to Achaemenid Persia, dating back to the time of his father, Amyntas I, although Macedon retained a broad scope of autonomy. In 492 BC it was made a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire by Mardonius&#x27; campaign. Alexander acted as a representative of the Persian governor Mardonius during peace negotiations after the Persian defeat at the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC. In later events, Herodotus several times mentions Alexander as a man who was on Xerxes&#x27; side and followed his orders.

From the time of Mardonius&#x27; conquest of Macedon, Herodotus refers to Alexander as &quot;hyparchos&quot;, meaning viceroy. Despite his cooperation with Persia, Alexander frequently gave supplies and advice to other Greek city states, and warned them of Mardonius&#x27; plans before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC. For example, Alexander warned the Greeks in Tempe to leave before the arrival of Xerxes&#x27; troops, and notified them of an alternate route into Thessaly through upper Macedonia. After their defeat in Plataea, the Persian army under the command of Artabazus tried to retreat all the way back to Asia Minor. Most of the 43,000 survivors were attacked and killed by the forces of Alexander at the estuary of the Strymon river. Alexander eventually regained Macedonian independence after the end of the Persian Wars.
Alexander claimed descent from Argive Greeks and Heracles. After a court of Elean hellanodikai determined his claim to be true, he was permitted to participate in the Olympic Games possibly in 504 BC, a right reserved only for Greeks. He modelled his court after Athens and was a patron of the poets Pindar and Bacchylides, both of whom dedicated poems to Alexander. The earliest reference to an Athenian proxenos, who lived during the time of the Persian wars (c. 490 BC), is that of Alexander I. It was around this point that Alexander was given the epithet &quot;philhellene&quot;.

== Issue ==
Alexander and his unnamed spouse had at least six children:
* Perdiccas II, succeeded Alexander I. 
* Menelaus, father of Amyntas II
* Philip
* Amyntas, whose son Arrhidaeus was the father of Amyntas III. 
* Alcetas
* Stratonice, married by her brother Perdiccas II to Seuthes II of Thrace.

== Family tree ==
Modern historians disagree on a number of details concerning the genealogy of the Argead dynasty. Robin Lane Fox, for example, refutes Nicholas Hammond&#x27;s claim that Ptolemy of Aloros was Amyntas II&#x27;s son, arguing that Ptolemy was neither his son nor an Argead.

<text>is a subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. The west side of the Hidaka mountains occupies most of the area. Hidaka is sparsely populated and has many of Hokkaido&#x27;s natural resources. The governmental office is located in Urakawa.

== History ==
*1897: Urakawa Subprefecture established.
*1932: Urakawa Subprefecture renamed Hidaka Subprefecture.

The name Hidaka (&quot;sun high&quot;) is derived from the province of the same name established in 1869, which in turn was named after an unknown place in the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot;, a history book written in 720. There is no direct connection between the Hidaka of the &quot;Nihonshoki&quot; and the modern Hidaka.

== Geography ==
Located on the south-east coast of Hokkaido, Hidaka Subprefecture has an area of making it the 7th largest subprefecture in the prefecture and 5.8% of Hokkaido&#x27;s total area. More than 80% of the area is covered with forest.

The prefecture borders Tokachi Subprefecture to the north across the Hidaka Mountains. To the west is Iburi Subprefecture. The south side of the subprefecture is its coast on the Pacific Ocean.

The Hidaka Mountains are known as a &quot;Mecca of Mountaineering&quot;, with more than 20 mountains including Mount Poroshiri at . These mountains are part of the Hidaka Sanmyaku-Erimo Quasi-National Park, which include Mount Apoi alpine vegetation community and Cape Erimo coast landscape. These areas boast wildlife such as brown bear, sika deer, and common seal.

<text>Marcus Samuel Blitzstein (March 2, 1905January 22, 1964), was an American composer, lyricist, and librettist. He won national attention in 1937 when his pro-union musical &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, directed by Orson Welles, was shut down by the Works Progress Administration. He is known for &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; and for his off-Broadway translation/adaptation of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. His works also include the opera &quot;Regina&quot;, an adaptation of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;; the Broadway musical &quot;Juno&quot;, based on Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s play &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;; and &quot;No for an Answer&quot;. He completed translation/adaptations of Brecht&#x27;s and Weill&#x27;s musical play &quot;Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot; and of Brecht&#x27;s play &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; with music by Paul Dessau. Blitzstein also composed music for films, such as &quot;Surf and Seaweed&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot; (1937), and he contributed two songs to the original 1960 production of Hellman&#x27;s play &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;.

==Life and career==
Blitzstein was born in Philadelphia on March 2, 1905, to affluent parents. Blitzstein&#x27;s musical gifts were apparent at an early age; he had performed a Mozart piano concerto by the time he was seven. He went on to study piano with Alexander Siloti (a pupil of Tchaikovsky and Liszt), and made his professional concerto debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra in Liszt&#x27;s E-flat Piano Concerto when he was 21.

After studying composition at the Curtis Institute of Music, he went to Europe to continue his studies in Berlin with Arnold Schoenberg (with whom he did not get on), and in Paris with Nadia Boulanger (with whom he did). Despite his later political beliefs, he was, in the early years of his career, a self-proclaimed and unrepentant artistic snob, who firmly believed that true art was only for the intellectual elite. He was vociferous in denouncing composers—in particular Respighi, Ravel, and Kurt Weill—who, he felt, debased their standards to reach a wider public.

His works of this period, mostly pianistic vehicles such as the &quot;Piano Sonata&quot; (1927) and the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; (Blitzen) are typical of the Boulanger-influenced products of American modernism — strongly rhythmic (though not influenced by jazz) and described by himself as &quot;wild, dissonant and percussive.&quot; These early works were far removed from the Schoenberg style.

The dramatic premiere of the pro-union &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; took place at the Venice Theater on June 16, 1937. The cast had been locked out of the Maxine Elliott Theatre by the Works Progress Administration, the government agency which had originally funded the production, so the cast and musicians walked with the audience to the nearby Venice. There, without costumes or sets, they performed the work concert-style, actors and musicians alike, sitting among the audience (to evade union restrictions on their performance) with Blitzstein narrating from the piano. In 1939, Leonard Bernstein led a revival of the play at Harvard, narrating from the piano just as Blitzstein had done. Blitzstein attended the performance, after which he and Bernstein became close friends; Bernstein would later say that Blitzstein&#x27;s contribution to the American musical theatre was &quot;incalculable&quot;. The 1999 film &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; was based on this event, though heavily embellished. In the film, Blitzstein (played by Hank Azaria) is portrayed as gaining inspiration through ghostly appearances by his idol Brecht and his late anorexic wife.
Additional major compositions include the autobiographical radio song play &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Tune&quot;, &quot;The Airborne Symphony&quot; (1946), &quot;Regina&quot; (1949), &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; (1955), and &quot;Juno&quot; (1959). At the time of his death Blitzstein was at work on &quot;Idiots First&quot;, a one-act opera based on the eponymous story by Bernard Malamud – intended to be part of a set of one-acters called &quot;Tales of Malamud&quot; – which Ned Rorem has called &quot;his best work&quot;. This was followed by the work Blitzstein intended to be his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a three-act opera commissioned by the Ford Foundation and optioned by the Metropolitan Opera entitled &quot;Sacco and Vanzetti&quot;. Both &quot;Tales of Malamud&quot; and &quot;Sacco and Vanzetti&quot; were completed posthumously, with the approval of Blitzstein&#x27;s estate, by composer Leonard Lehrman. Lehrman&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-Bibliography&quot;, published in 2005 by Praeger, is the longest published biographical bibliography of any American composer at 645 pages.

In 1958, Blitzstein was subpoenaed to appear before the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). Appearing first in a closed session, Blitzstein admitted his membership in the Communist Party (ending in 1949) and, challenging the right of HUAC to question him at all, refused to name names or cooperate any further. He was recalled for a further public session, but after a day sitting anxiously in a waiting room he was not called to testify.

During a visit to Martinique in 1964, at the age of 58, Blitzstein was murdered by three sailors he had picked up in a bar, one of whom he was said to have propositioned. He is buried at Chelten Hills Cemetery in Philadelphia.

== Personal life and family ==
Blitzstein was openly gay. He wrote to his sister in 1929, regarding prior attempts to suppress or hide his orientation, &quot;it is absurd to assume there are no sins; there are definitely Cardinal sins -- sins against oneself, against one&#x27;s law. My sin is, has been... the willingness to corrupt my nature.&quot; His first lover was the conductor Alexander Smallens, with whom he traveled to Europe in 1924. Blitzstein nevertheless married novelist Eva Goldbeck on March 2, 1933. They had no children.
His mother-in-law was Berlin-born musical star and opera singer Lina Abarbanell. He dedicated a number of works, including &quot;Romantic Piece for Orchestra&quot; (1930), String Quartet, &#x27;The Italian&#x27; (1930), the ballet &quot;Cain&quot; (1930), and the &quot;Serenade for String Quartet&quot; (1932) to his wife-to-be. She died of anorexia in 1936, and his grief prompted him to throw himself into the work of creating &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;.

<doc id="320686" wikidata="Q723147" url="?curid=320686" title="Billy Bean">
<text>William Daro Bean (May 11, 1964 – August 6, 2024) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as an outfielder for the Detroit Tigers (1987–1989), Los Angeles Dodgers (1989), and San Diego Padres (1993–1995), as well as the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in 1992. In July 2014, he was named MLB&#x27;s first ambassador for inclusion, having publicly come out as gay in 1999. In January 2016, he became MLB&#x27;s vice president, ambassador for inclusion and was senior vice president and special assistant to the commissioner.

==Early life==
Bean&#x27;s father, Bill Bean, and mother, Linda Robertson, grew up on the same street and were classmates at Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. The couple married while Linda was pregnant, then separated when Billy was six months old. Linda married Ed Kovac, a police officer with three children. Linda initially worked as a uniformed officer, but because women could not be in the same police departments as their husbands, she quit her job upon remarriage. Bean&#x27;s extended Catholic step family grew to six children. When he was a child, Bean&#x27;s grandmother divorced his maternal grandfather, and he has three aunts on his mother&#x27;s side of the family.

==Playing career==
Bean attended Santa Ana High School, where he graduated as valedictorian, played football under coach Tom Nice, and won a state championship with the Santa Ana Saints baseball team. He enrolled at Loyola Marymount University on an athletic scholarship to play college baseball for the Loyola Marymount Lions.

Bean was a two-time All-American outfielder at LMU. After his junior year, the New York Yankees selected Bean in the 24th round of the 1985 MLB Draft.
Though the Yankees offered Bean a $55,000 signing bonus, Bean was persuaded by his college coach, Dave Snow, to return for LMU for his senior year.

During the summer of 1985, Bean played minor league baseball for the Fairbanks Goldpanners and was named Goldpanners&#x27; Player of The Year.

During the 1986 college baseball season, Bean led the Lions to a midseason #1 national ranking and a berth to the 1986 College World Series, the first (and as of 2024, only) time the school has made the College World Series.

Bean graduated from LMU with a degree in Business Administration.

The Detroit Tigers selected Bean in the fourth round of the 1986 MLB Draft. He signed with the Tigers for $12,500. Bean made his major league debut for the Tigers on April 25, 1987, and tied the major league record of 4 hits in his debut game. He had a total of 6 bases with two doubles and won over the fans in Tiger Stadium who were chanting his name in the later inning at-bats. He spent most of the 1988 season in the minor leagues, where he led the Toledo Mud Hens in batting average; among his teammates in Toledo was the similarly named Billy Beane. Bean played in 10 games for the Tigers after he was promoted back to the major leagues in August 1988. He played in nine games for the Tigers in the 1989 season. On July 17, 1989, the Tigers traded Bean to the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor leaguers Steve Green and Domingo Michel. He batted .197 for the Dodgers in 51 games, and was demoted to the minor leagues.

Bean played in Minor League Baseball during the 1990 and 1991 seasons. He played for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball in 1992, batting .208 in seven games. Bean signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres before the 1993 season. He was promoted back to the major leagues. He batted .260 in 88 games for the Padres in 1993 and .215 in 84 games for the Padres in 1994. After playing for the Padres in 1995, Bean retired from baseball after the 1995 season.

==Television appearances==
Bean was a panelist on GSN&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; revival in 2006, and was a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Athletics Foundation. He appeared in a 2009 episode of &quot;Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List&quot;, showing Griffin several homes.

In 2007, Bean was hired as a consultant by Scout Productions, the team of David Collins and Michael Williams, who produced Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;, for their next project with Showtime entitled &quot;The Beard&quot;. The project was to be a romantic comedy about a gay professional baseball player who enters into a relationship with a woman to survive in the sports world; Showtime did not go forward with the series.

Bean starred in a MTV episode of &quot;Made&quot;, he was an actor in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, and appeared as himself on the HBO series &quot;Arli$$&quot; in the 2002 episode &quot;Playing it Safe&quot;.

==Personal life==
Reflecting on his childhood, Bean remarked, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been gay. I was gay since birth, and I just knew that there was something different about me but I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on it until I think it was 13 years old.&quot; He continued, &quot;I always had a girlfriend from, like, the age of 14.&quot;

In 1989, Bean married Anna Maria Amato, a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandise in Los Angeles, whom Bean had been dating since 1985. The Bean-Amato wedding was held on the Bluff at Loyola and attended by 300 guests, including 20 major league baseball players.

Two years into his marriage, while playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; AAA affiliate in Albuquerque, Bean met a man at a cowboy-themed gay bar. In January 1993, while Bean and his wife were visiting her parents in the Washington, DC suburbs, Bean met his future partner Sam Madani, an Iranian immigrant, in the gym showers at a Maryland health club. One week later, Amato and Bean separated and began divorce proceedings.

Bean and his new partner Madani, who was raised in Austria and France, and spoke six languages, moved into a multi-level condo with ocean views in a Del Mar, California, gated community.

Bean gave Madani a private tour of the Padres locker room at Jack Murphy Stadium, showing him the behind-the-scenes world of an MLB player.

Bean and Madani kept their relationship and living arrangement secret from Bean&#x27;s MLB teammates. When Bean&#x27;s Padres teammates, Brad Ausmus and Trevor Hoffman, stopped by unannounced to Bean and Madani&#x27;s condo, Madani had to hide in the car for approximately three hours for fear that they would be identified as a gay couple. In 1994, Bean hosted a Super Bowl party for friends and family members and introduced Madani as &quot;just a buddy&quot;.

On April 23, 1995, Madani, who less than two months earlier had been diagnosed HIV-positive, collapsed at their home. When Bean returned home after playing in an exhibition game against the Anaheim Angels, he discovered his partner unconscious. The MLB outfielder rushed Madani to the closest hospital, but changed course after recalling that he had recently appeared at the local hospital as a member of the Padres. Fearing that he would be outed, Bean drove an extra 30 minutes to a different hospital in a different direction. The next morning, Madani died of a cardiac arrest from AIDS-related complications. Bean had a baseball game at one o&#x27;clock that afternoon. Their homosexual relationship was guardedly private, and Bean did not attend Madani’s public funeral.

Bean retired after the 1995 MLB season, and gradually came out as gay to his parents and friends. He came out publicly to Lydia Martin of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; in 1999, becoming the second Major League Baseball player to publicly come out as gay; Glenn Burke was the first to come out to his teammates and employers during his playing days but did not come out to the public at large until his career was over. Following Burke&#x27;s death in 1995, Bean became close with Burke&#x27;s family.

After leaving baseball, Bean moved to Miami Beach, Florida, for 15 years. He was in a relationship with Efrain Veiga, the founder of Yuca, a local restaurant, for 13 years, breaking up in July 2008.

In 2003, Bean released a memoir titled &quot;Going the Other Way: Lessons from a Life In and Out of Major League Baseball&quot;.

Bean was appointed MLB&#x27;s first &quot;Ambassador for Inclusion&quot; on July 15, 2014. In this role, Bean counseled David Denson, who became the first minor league player signed to an MLB organization to come out as gay. He later became the league&#x27;s senior vice president for diversity, equity and inclusion.

Bean was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in 2023. He died at his home in New York City on August 6, 2024, at the age of 60. At the time of his death, Bean was married to Greg Baker, a doctor, Manchester, New Hampshire native, and Boston Red Sox fan.

<text>David Marquette Kopay (born June 28, 1942) is a former American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) who in 1975 became one of the first professional athletes to come out as gay.

==Life==
Kopay attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California. He entered the University of Washington in 1961. He was on the West roster as a halfback at the All-America East vs. West Football Game in 1964. Kopay was signed by the San Francisco 49ers, and played professional football from 1964 to 1972. After he retired from the NFL, he was considered a top contender for coaching positions, but he believes he was snubbed by professional and college teams because of his sexual orientation. Kopay went to work as a salesman/purchaser in his uncle&#x27;s floorcovering business in Hollywood. He is also a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Athletics Foundation.

Kopay&#x27;s 1977 biography, &quot;The David Kopay Story&quot;, written with Perry Deane Young, became a best-seller. In 1986, Kopay, without naming him, revealed his brief affair with Jerry Smith, a football player who played for the Washington Redskins from 1965 to 1977 and who died of AIDS without ever having publicly come out of the closet.

==Social impact==
Since Kopay, six additional former NFL players have come out as gay, Roy Simmons in 1992, Esera Tuaolo in 2002, Wade Davis in 2012, Kwame Harris in 2013, Ryan O&#x27;Callaghan in 2017, and Colton Underwood in 2021. To date, only one &quot;current&quot; NFL player, Carl Nassib, has come out publicly as gay (in 2021). Kopay has been credited with inspiring these athletes to be more open about their sexual orientation. In May 1977, Kopay was on the cover of &quot;GPU (Gay People&#x27;s Union) News&quot; of Milwaukee.

Kopay appears as himself in a small but pivotal role in the film &quot;Tru Loved&quot; (2008). His scene features young actor Matthew Thompson and Alexandra Paul.

Kopay became a Gay Games Ambassador for the Federation of Gay Games. He went to Gay Games VII in Chicago in July 2006 and was a featured announcer in the opening ceremonies.

Kopay announced in September 2007 that he will leave $1 million as an endowment to the University of Washington Q Center.

<doc id="320695" wikidata="Q867306" url="?curid=320695" title="Music of Thailand">
<text>The music of Thailand includes a wide array of distinct genres, both traditional and modern.

Traditional Thai musical instruments are varied and reflect ancient influence from far afield – including the &quot;klong thap&quot; and &quot;khim&quot; (Persian origin), the &quot;chakhe&quot; (Indian origin), the &quot;klong chin&quot; (Chinese origin), and the &quot;klong khaek&quot; (Indonesian origin).

The two most popular styles of traditional Thai music are luk thung and mor lam. The latter in particular has close affinities with the music of Laos.

Aside from the Thai, ethnic minorities such as the Lao, Lawa, Hmong, Akha, Khmer, Lisu, Karen and Lahu peoples have retained traditional musical forms.

Though Thailand was never colonized by colonial powers, pop music and other forms of modern Asian, European and American music have become extremely influential.

==Traditional and folk music==
===Classical music===

Thai classical music is synonymous with those stylized court ensembles and repertoires that emerged in their present form within the royal centers of Central Thailand some 800 years ago. These ensembles, while being influenced by older practices and repertoires from India, are today uniquely Thai expressions. While the three primary classical ensembles, the Piphat, Khrueang sai and Mahori differ in significant ways, they all share a basic instrumentation and theoretical approach. Each employs small ching hand cymbals and krap wooden sticks to mark the primary beat reference. Thai classical music has had a wide influence on the musical traditions of neighboring countries. The traditional music of Myanmar was strongly influenced by the Thai music repertoire, called Yodaya (ယိုးဒယား), which was brought over from the Ayutthaya Kingdom. As Siam expanded its political and cultural influence to Laos and Cambodia during the early Rattanakosin period, its music was quickly absorbed by the Cambodian and Lao courts. As Frédéric Maurel explains: &quot;From the close of the eighteenth century and through the nineteenth century, a number of Khmer pages, classical women dancers, and musicians studied with Thai ajarn (masters or teachers) in Cambodia. The presence of this Thai elite in Cambodia contributed to the development of strong Thai cultural influence among the Khmer upper classes. Moreover, some members of the Khmer royal family went to the Thai court and developed close relations with well-educated Thai nobility, as well as several court poets. Such cultural links were so powerful that, in some fields, one might use the term &#x27;Siamization&#x27; in referring to the processes of cultural absorption at the Khmer court at that time.&quot;

Several kinds of small drums (&quot;klong&quot;) are employed in these ensembles to outline the basic rhythmic structure () that is punctuated at the end by the striking of a suspended gong (&quot;mong&quot;). Seen in its most basic formulation, the classical Thai orchestras have a very strong influence on the Cambodian (Khmer) pinpeat and mahori ensembles, and are structurally similar to other orchestras found within the widespread Southeast Asian gong-chime musical culture, such as the large gamelan ensembles of Bali and Java, which most likely have their common roots in the diffusion of Vietnamese Dong-Son bronze drums beginning in the first century.

Traditional Thai classical repertoire is anonymous, handed down through an oral tradition of performance in which the names of composers (if, indeed, pieces were historically created by single authors) are not known. However, since the beginning of the modern Bangkok period, composers&#x27; names have been known and, since around the turn of the century, many major composers have recorded their works in notation. Musicians, however, imagine these compositions and notations as generic forms which are realized in full in idiosyncratic variations and improvisations in the context of performance.

===Piphat===

Piphat is the most common and iconic Thai classical music style. It symbolizes the dancing of the Thailand&#x27;s legendary dragons, and consists of a midsized orchestra including two xylophones (ranat), an oboe (pi), barrel drums (klong) and two circular sets of tuned horizontal gong-chimes (khong wong lek and khong wong yai). Piphat can be performed in either a loud outdoor style using hard mallets (Piphat mai khaeng; ปี่พาทย์ไม้แข็ง) or in an indoor style using padded hammers (Piphat mai nuam; ปี่พาทย์ไม้นวม). 

There are several types of piphat ensembles ranging in size and orchestration, each kind typically being associated with specific ceremonial purposes. The highly decorated piphat ensemble that features the ornately carved and painted semicircular vertical gong-chime is traditionally associated with the funeral and cremation ceremonies of the Mon ethnic group. Different versions of the piphat ensemble are employed to accompany specific forms of traditional Thai drama such as the large shadow puppet theater (nang yai) and the khon dance drama.

===Khrueang sai===

The khrueang sai orchestra combines some of the percussion of wind instruments of the piphat with an expanded string section including the saw duang (a high-pitched two-string bowed lute), the lower pitched saw u (bowed lute) and the three-string chakee (a plucked zither). In addition to these instruments are the khlui (vertical fipple flute) in several sizes and ranges, a goblet drum (thon-rammana) and, occasionally, a small hammered Chinese dulcimer (khim). The khrueang sai ensemble is primarily used for instrumental indoor performances and for accompanying the Thai (stick-puppet theater), a genre deeply influenced by Chinese puppetry styles. Accordingly, the addition of Chinese-sounding string instruments in the khrueang sai ensemble is imagined, by the Thai, to be a reference to the probable Chinese origins of this theater form.

===Mahori===

The third major Thai classical ensemble is the Mahori, traditionally played by women in the courts of both Central Thailand and Cambodia. Historically the ensemble included smaller instruments more appropriate, it was thought, to the build of female performers. Today the ensemble employs regular sized instruments—a combination of instruments from both the Khrueang sai and Piphat ensembles but excluding the loud and rather shrill oboe pi. The ensemble, which is performed in three sizes—small, medium and large—includes the three-string saw sam sai fiddle, a delicate-sounding, middle-range bowed lute with silk strings. Within the context of the Mahori ensemble, the so sam sai accompanies the vocalist, which plays a more prominent role in this ensemble than in any other classical Thai orchestra.

While Thai classical music was somewhat discouraged as being unmodern and backward looking during Thailand&#x27;s aggressively nationalistic modernization policies of mid-20th century, the classical arts have benefited recently from increased governmental sponsorship and funding as well as popular interest as expressed in such films as &quot;Homrong: The Overture&quot; (2003), a popular fictionalized biography of a famous traditional xylophone (ranat ek) performer.

===Luk thung===

&quot;Luk thung&quot;, or Thai country music, developed in the mid-20th century to reflect daily trials and tribulations of rural Thais. Pongsri Woranut and Suraphol Sombatcharoen were the genre&#x27;s first big stars, incorporating influences from other parts of Asia. Many of the most popular artists have come from the central city of Suphanburi, including megastar Pumpuang Duangjan, who pioneered electronic luk thung. The late 1990s saw a commercial resurgence of Luk Thung, and the modern electrified, pop-influenced version of the genre remains the country&#x27;s most popular music form.

===Mor Lam===

Mor lam is the dominant folk music of Thailand&#x27;s north-eastern Isan region, which has a mainly Lao population. It has much in common with &quot;luk thung&quot;, such as its focus on the life of the rural poor. It is characterized by rapid-fire, rhythmic vocals and a funk feel to the percussion. The lead singer, also called a mor lam, is most often accompanied by the khaen, also known as khene.

There are about fifteen regional variations of &quot;mor lam&quot;, plus modern versions such as mor lam sing. Some conservatives have criticized these as the commercialization of traditional cultures.

===Kantrum===
Kantrum is played by Khmer living near the border with Cambodia. It is a swift and very traditional dance music. In its purest form, cho-kantrum, singers, percussion and tro (a type of fiddle) dominate the sound. A more modern form using electric instrumentation arose in the mid-1980s. Later in the decade, Darkie became the genre&#x27;s biggest star, and he crossed into mainstream markets in the later 1990s.

==Musical instruments==

==Arrival of Western music==
While the composer Luang Pradit Phairau (1881–1954) used localized forms of cipher (number) notation, other composers such as Montri Tramote (1908–1995) used standard western staff notation. Several members of the Thai royal family have been deeply involved in composition, including King Prajadhipok (Rama VII, 1883–1941) and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927–2016), whose compositions have been more often for jazz bands than classical Thai ensembles.

Classical Thai music is polyphonic and follows similar conventions to American folk and dixieland music. Each instrument improvises within accepted idioms around basic lines of harmony or melody called paths. Rhythmically and metrically Thai music is steady in tempo, regular in pulse, divisive, in simple duple meter, without swing, with little syncopation (p. 3, 39), and with the emphasis on the final beat of a measure or group of pulses and phrase (p. 41), as opposed to the first as in European-influenced music. The Thai scale includes seven tempered notes, instead of a mixture of tones and semitones. Five of seven pitches are used as the principal pitches in any mode, introducing nonequidistant intervals. 
===Phleng phra racha nipon===

From the 1940s to the 1970s King Bhumibol Adulyadej wrote a total of 48 compositions. It was during this time that he decided to specialize in wind instruments, especially the saxophone and the clarinet. By the time Bhumibol turned 18, he started to compose his own music with the first song being &quot;Candlelight Blues&quot;. He continued to compose even during his reign following his coronation in 1946. Bhumibol performed with Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Benny Goodman, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter. Throughout his life, Bhumibol wrote a total of 49 compositions. Much of it is jazz swing but he also composed marches, waltzes, and Thai patriotic songs. His most popular compositions were &quot;Candlelight Blues&quot;, &quot;Love at Sundown&quot;, and &quot;Falling Rain&quot; which were all composed in 1946. Bhumibol&#x27;s musical influences included Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Benny Carter, and Johnny Hodges. Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart.

===Rock===

By the 1930s, however, Western classical music, showtunes, jazz and tango were popular. Soon, jazz grew to dominate Thai popular music, and Khru Eua Sunthornsanan soon set up the first Thai jazz band. The music he soon helped to invent along with influential band Suntharaporn was called pleng Thai sakorn, which incorporated Thai melodies with Western classical music. This music continued to evolve into luk grung, a romantic music that was popular with the upper-class. King Bhumibol was an accomplished jazz musician and composer.

===Phleng phuea chiwit===

By the 1960s, Western rock was popular and Thai artists began imitating bands like Cliff Richard &amp; the Shadows; this music was called wong shadow, and it soon evolved into a form of Thai pop called string. Among the groups that emerged from this period was The Impossibles. The &#x27;70s also saw Rewat Buddhinan beginning to use the Thai language in rock music as well as the rise of protest songs called phleng phuea chiwit (&quot;songs for life&quot;).

The earliest phleng phuea chiwit band was called Caravan, and they were at the forefront of a movement for democracy. In 1976, police and right wing activists attacked students at Thammasat University; Caravan, along with other bands and activists, fled for the rural hills. There, Caravan continued playing music for local farmers, and wrote songs that would appear on their later albums.

In the 1980s, phleng phuea chiwit re-entered the mainstream with a grant of amnesty to dissidents. Bands like Carabao became best-sellers and incorporated nationalistic elements in their lyrics. By the 1990s, phleng phuea chiwit had largely fallen from the top of the Thai charts, though artists like Pongsit Kamphee continued to command a large audience.

===String===

String pop took over mainstream listeners in Thailand in the 1990s, and exponents like Christina Aguilar, Bird Thongchai McIntyre and Asanee-Wasan became best-sellers. Simultaneously, Britpop influenced alternative rock artists like Modern Dog, Loso, Crub and Proud became popular in late 1990s. In 2006, famous Thai rock bands include Clash, Big Ass, Bodyslam and Silly Fools. The late 1990s saw pop overshadowed by the remarkable commercial resurgence of luk thung, but modern luk thung has also adopted some elements from the pop acts.

===Heavy metal===
Heavy metal music in Thailand was very popular in early 90s. Many heavy metal bands in this era included Hi-Rock, Stone Metal Fire, I-Scream, Uranium and Big Gun.

===Hip hop===
=== T-pop ===
==Indie==
A group of independent artists and records which produces music for non-commercial purpose also found in Thailand: Bakery Music (now under Sony Music) ; Smallroom ; FAT radio ; City-Blue ; Coolvoice ; Dudesweet ; Idea-radio Panda Records ; and SO::ON Dry Flower .

<doc id="320696" wikidata="Q237639" url="?curid=320696" title="Radclyffe Hall">
<text>Marguerite Antonia Radclyffe-Hall (12 August 1880 – 7 October 1943), more known under her pen name Radclyffe Hall, was an English poet and author, best known for the novel &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, a groundbreaking work in lesbian literature. In adulthood, she often called herself John, rather than Marguerite.

==Early life ==
Marguerite Antonia Radclyffe-Hall was born in 1880 at &quot;Sunny Lawn&quot;, Durley Road, Bournemouth, Hampshire (now Dorset), to Radclyffe (&quot;Rat&quot;) Radclyffe-Hall (1846–1898) and Mary Jane Sager (née Diehl). Hall&#x27;s father was a wealthy philanderer, educated at Eton and Oxford but seldom working, since he inherited a large amount of money from his father, an eminent physician who was head of the British Medical Association; her mother was an unstable American widow from Philadelphia. Radclyffe&#x27;s father left in 1882, abandoning young Radclyffe and her mother. However, he did leave behind a considerable inheritance for Radclyffe.

Hall&#x27;s mother subsequently married Albert Visetti, a professor of singing, whom she did not like and who had a tempestuous relationship with her mother. Hall also despised her mother. Throughout her childhood, Mary made it clear that the daughter was unwanted after failing to get an abortion during pregnancy. She frequently dipped into Hall&#x27;s inheritance money for herself.

As Hall grew older and gained more autonomy, she realized that she had enough inheritance money from her father to live without working or marrying. She began to do as she pleased, dressing in typical men&#x27;s fashion of the times, such as trousers, monocles and hats. Hall was a lesbian but described herself as a &quot;congenital invert&quot;, a term taken from the writings of Havelock Ellis and other turn-of-the-century sexologists. Having reached adulthood without a vocation, she spent much of her twenties pursuing women she eventually lost to marriage.

In 1907 at the Bad Homburg spa in Germany, Hall met Mabel Batten (1856–1916), a well-known amateur singer of . Batten (nicknamed &quot;Ladye&quot;) was 51 years old to Hall&#x27;s 27, and was married with an adult daughter and grandchildren. They fell in love and, after Batten&#x27;s husband died, they set up residence together. Batten introduced Hall to a circle of artistic and intellectual women, many of them lesbians. She also was the first to call Hall &quot;John&quot;, after noting her resemblance to one of Hall&#x27;s male ancestors, and Hall used this name for the rest of her life. Batten encouraged Hall to begin seeking publishing for her poetry.

In 1915, Hall fell in love with Batten&#x27;s cousin, Una Troubridge (1887–1963). Troubridge was a sculptor, the wife of Vice-Admiral Ernest Troubridge, and the mother of a young daughter. Troubridge and Hall would be lovers for the remainder of their lives. The romance caused tension between Batten, Hall, and Troubridge, until 1916 when Batten died. Upon her death, Hall had Batten&#x27;s corpse embalmed and a silver crucifix blessed by the pope laid on it. Hall, Batten, and Troubridge were &quot;undeterred by the Church&#x27;s admonitions on same-sex relationships. Hall&#x27;s Catholicism sat beside a life-long attachment to spiritualism and reincarnation.&quot; In 1917, Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge began living together. From 1924 to 1929 they lived at 37 Holland Street, Kensington, London. The relationship lasted until Hall&#x27;s death.

==Career==
After a period of travel and education, Hall published five books of poetry between 1906 and 1915.

Hall&#x27;s first novel was &quot;The Unlit Lamp&quot;, published in 1924. It follows Joan Ogden, a young girl who dreams of setting up a flat in London with her friend Elizabeth (a so-called Boston marriage) and studying to become a doctor but feels trapped by her manipulative mother&#x27;s emotional dependence on her. Its length and grimness made it a difficult book to sell, so Hall deliberately chose a lighter theme for her next novel, a social comedy entitled &quot;The Forge&quot; (1924). While she had used her full name for her early poetry collections, she shortened it to M. Radclyffe Hall for &quot;The Forge&quot;. The book was a modest success, making the bestseller list of &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. &quot;The Unlit Lamp&quot;, which followed it into print, was the first printed with her name simply as Radclyffe Hall.

There followed another comic novel, &quot;A Saturday Life&quot; (1925), and then &quot;Adam&#x27;s Breed&quot; (1926), a novel about an Italian headwaiter who, becoming disgusted with his job and even with the food itself, gives away his belongings and lives as a hermit in the forest. The book&#x27;s mystical themes have been compared to Hermann Hesse&#x27;s &quot;Siddhartha&quot;. It sold well, was critically acclaimed, and won both the Prix Femina and the James Tait Black Prize, a feat previously achieved only by E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. In 1926, she published her first short story dealing with homosexuality. Twelve days later, she began writing &quot;The Well of Loneliness.&quot;

===&quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;===
Hall&#x27;s most well-known work is &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, the only one of her eight novels to have overt lesbian themes. Published in 1928, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; deals with the life of Stephen Gordon, a masculine lesbian who, like Hall herself, identifies as an &quot;invert&quot;. The novel paints a vulnerable, sympathetic portrayal of lesbians.

Although &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; is not sexually explicit, it was nevertheless the subject of an obscenity trial in the UK, which resulted in an order for the destruction of all copies of the book. The United States allowed its publication only after a long court battle. It is currently published in the UK by Virago, and by Anchor Press in the United States. &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; was number seven on a list of the top 100 lesbian and gay novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999. It is now noted as the predecessor to the golden age of lesbian pulp fiction.

====&quot;The Girls of Radcliff Hall&quot;====
British composer and bon vivant Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners, wrote a roman à clef titled &quot;The Girls of Radcliff Hall&quot;, in which he depicts himself and his circle of friends, including Cecil Beaton and Oliver Messel, as lesbian schoolgirls at a school named Radcliff Hall. The novel was written under the pseudonym Adela Quebec and published and distributed privately; the indiscretions to which it alluded created an uproar among Berners&#x27; intimates and acquaintances, making the whole affair widely discussed in the 1930s. Cecil Beaton attempted to have all the copies destroyed. The book subsequently disappeared from circulation, making it extremely rare. The story is, however, included in Berners&#x27; &quot;Collected Tales and Fantasies&quot;.

===Later novels===
Hall published one novel after &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;. An anonymous verse lampoon titled &quot;The Sink of Solitude&quot; had appeared during the controversy over &quot;The Well&quot;. Although its primary targets were James Douglas, who had called for &quot;The Well&quot;″s suppression, and the Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks, who had started legal proceedings, it also mocked Hall and her book. One of the illustrations, which depicted Hall nailed to a cross, so horrified her that she could barely speak of it for years afterwards. Her sense of guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel &quot;The Master of the House&quot;.

At Hall&#x27;s insistence, &quot;The Master of the House&quot; was published with no cover blurb, which may have misled some purchasers into thinking it was another novel about &quot;inversion&quot;. Advance sales were strong, and the book made No. 1 on &quot;The Observer&quot;″s bestseller list, but it received poor reviews in several key periodicals, and sales soon dropped off. In the United States reviewers treated the book more kindly, but shortly after the book&#x27;s publication, all copies were seized - not by the police, but by creditors; Hall&#x27;s American publisher had gone bankrupt. Houghton Mifflin took over the rights, but by the time the book could be republished, its sales momentum was lost.

== Later years and death ==
Hall lived with Troubridge in London and, during the 1930s, in the small town of Rye, East Sussex, noted for its many writers, including her contemporary the novelist E. F. Benson. Hall also was involved in affairs with other women throughout the years, including the actress Ethel Waters.

In 1930, Hall received the Gold Medal of the Eichelberger Humane Award. She was a member of the PEN club, the council of the Society for Psychical Research and a fellow of the Zoological Society. In 1997 Hall was listed at No. 16 in the top 500 lesbian and gay heroes in &quot;The Pink Paper&quot;.

On holiday around 1934, Troubridge contracted enteritis. Evguenia Souline, a Russian nurse, was hired to care for her. Hall and Souline ended up having an affair, which Troubridge knew about and painfully tolerated. It unsettled Troubridge deeply, but she remained with Hall.

In 1943, Hall was diagnosed with cancer of the rectum. Operations were unsuccessful and she died at the age of 63. Her body is buried in a vault in the Circle of Lebanon on the western side of Highgate Cemetery at the entrance of the chamber of the Batten family, where Mabel is also buried.

<doc id="320698" wikidata="Q1376064" url="?curid=320698" title="Tom Waddell">
<text>Tom Waddell (born Thomas Flubacher; November 1, 1937 – July 11, 1987) was an American physician and decathlete who competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics, and founder of the Gay Olympics (later known as the Gay Games).

Adopted by former vaudeville acrobats, Waddell excelled in athletics and eventually attended medical school. He competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics, and after a career-ending injury, he started a successful medical practice in San Francisco. Inspired by his experience in a gay bowling league, Waddell founded the Gay Olympics, emphasizing sportsmanship, personal achievement, and inclusiveness. He also had a daughter with lesbian athlete Sara Lewinstein. Diagnosed with AIDS in 1985, Waddell died in 1987. His life and contributions to LGBTQ history have been posthumously honored in multiple ways.

==Early life==
Waddell was born Thomas Flubacher in Paterson, New Jersey, to a Catholic German-American family. His parents separated when he was in his teens, and at the age of fifteen he went to live with Gene and Hazel Waddell, for whom he did chores; they adopted him six years later. The Waddells were former vaudeville acrobats and encouraged Tom to take up gymnastics. Gene Waddell is one of the men in the famous photograph of acrobats balancing atop the Empire State Building. In high school, Tom Waddell excelled in athletics.

Waddell attended Springfield College in Massachusetts on a track scholarship. Originally majoring in physical education, he switched to pre-medicine following the sudden death of his best friend and co-captain of the gymnastics team, an event that moved him deeply. At Springfield, he competed on the gymnastics and football teams. In the summer of 1959, Tom worked at a children&#x27;s camp in western Massachusetts, where he met his first lover, socialist Enge Menaker, then a 63-year-old man. They remained close for the rest of Menaker&#x27;s life, which ended in 1985 when he was 90 years old.

==Medical career==
Waddell attended medical school at New Jersey College of Medicine, a division of Seton Hall University, and in 1965 undertook his medical internship at Beth El Hospital, Brooklyn. In 1965, he traveled from Brooklyn, New York to participate in the Civil Rights Movement in Selma, Alabama.

Drafted into the Army in 1966, Waddell became a preventive-medicine officer and paratrooper. Entering a course in global medicine, he protested when he found out that he would be shipped to Vietnam. Expecting a court-martial, he was instead unexpectedly sent to train as a decathlete for the 1968 Olympics.

After discharge from the army, Waddell undertook medical residencies at Georgetown University and Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx. At Georgetown, he did research on viruses at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. In 1970, he began a graduate fellowship at Stanford University.

Waddell established his private practice on 18th Street in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco in 1974. His medical background enabled him to find jobs easily and in exotic locales. He also served in the Middle East as medical director of the Whittaker Corporation from 1974 through 1981. Part of his job entailed serving as personal physician for a Saudi prince and a Saudi businessman and he eventually became the team physician for the Saudi Arabian Olympic team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics.
In the 1980s Waddell was employed at the City Clinic in San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center area; after his death, it was renamed for him.

==Sporting career==
He traveled on a U.S. State Department-sponsored track and field tour of Africa in 1962.

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Waddell placed sixth among the 33 competitors. He broke five of his own personal records in the 10 events.

In 1972, in a track meet in Hawaii, he injured his knee in a high jump, which ended his career as a competitive athlete.

==Gay Olympics==
Soon after returning to San Francisco in 1972, Waddell joined a gay bowling league. It inspired him to consider organizing a gay sporting event modeled on the Olympics. He followed through with the idea in the early 1980s. The first &quot;Gay Olympics&quot; was to take place in San Francisco in 1982 in the form of a sports competition and arts festival. But a few weeks before the event was to begin, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) sued Waddell&#x27;s organization over its use of the word &quot;Olympic.&quot;

Despite the IOC having not previously protested when other groups had used the name, they alleged that allowing &quot;Gay Olympics&quot; would injure them. They succeeded in securing an injunction just nineteen days before the first games were to begin. Nevertheless, the games, now re-named the &quot;Gay Games,&quot; went forward.

==Personal life==
While Waddell worked at Stanford in 1970, he met Lee Brian, with whom he had a five-year relationship.

In 1975, Waddell met landscape designer Charles Deaton, 12 years his senior, and they became lovers. An October 11, 1976 issue of &quot;People&quot; magazine featured the couple in a cover article. They were the first gay couple to appear on the cover of a major national magazine.

In 1981, while founding the Gay Games, Waddell met two people with whom he formed major relationships. One was public relations man and fundraiser Zohn Artman, with whom he fell in love and began a relationship. The other was lesbian athlete Sara Lewinstein. Both Tom and Sara had longed to have a child, and they decided to have a child together. Their daughter, Jessica, was born in 1983. To protect Jessica&#x27;s and her mother&#x27;s legal rights, Tom and Sara married in 1985.

==Death==
In 1985, Waddell was diagnosed with AIDS. Although dogged by the IOC&#x27;s lawsuit, Waddell lived to see the success of Gay Games II in 1986, and even participated, winning the gold medal in the javelin event. He died on July 11 the following year, aged 49, in San Francisco, California. His last words were &quot;Well, this should be interesting.&quot;

Waddell&#x27;s battle against HIV/AIDS is one of the subjects of the award-winning 1989 documentary &quot;Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt.&quot; His autobiography, &quot;Gay Olympian&quot;, which he co-authored with sports writer Dick Schaap, was published in 1996.

==Tributes==
In 2013, Waddell was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.

In 2014, a street in San Francisco formerly named after Lech Wałęsa was, due to a homophobic comment by Wałęsa, renamed Dr. Tom Waddell Place. The street already featured the Tom Waddell Health Center.

In 2014, Waddell was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco’s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot;

<doc id="320699" wikidata="Q1086932" url="?curid=320699" title="Christopher Rice">
<text>Christopher Travis Rice (born March 11, 1978) is an American author. Rice made his fiction debut in 2000 with the bestselling &quot;A Density of Souls&quot;, going on to write many more novels, including &quot;The Snow Garden&quot;, &quot;The Heavens Rise&quot;, &quot;The Vines&quot;, as well as the &quot;Burning Girl&quot; series. His work spans multiple genres, including suspense, crime, supernatural thriller, and erotic romance. With his mother Anne Rice, he is the co-author of the historical horror novel &quot;Ramses the Damned: The Passion of Cleopatra&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Ramses the Damned: The Reign of Osiris&quot;. As of 2025, Rice lived in West Hollywood, California.

==Early life and education==
Christopher Rice was born on March 11, 1978. His parents were novelist Anne Rice and poet Stan Rice; his aunt, Alice Borchardt, was a noted writer of fantasy and historical fiction. Rice had an older sister, Michele, who died from leukemia in 1972 when she was five years old. 

Rice was born in the San Francisco Bay Area and spent the first ten years of his childhood in the Castro District. Rice described the culture shock that resulted from his family&#x27;s move to New Orleans when he was ten years old: &quot;I went from a school in San Francisco where we called our lesbian teachers by their first names to this uptown, private elementary school where we all had to go to chapel in the morning.&quot;

Rice is a 1996 graduate of the Isidore Newman School, which he attended during the same time period as future NFL stars Peyton Manning and Eli Manning. He has stated that while he was never physically threatened during high school, his knowledge of his own sexuality and his failure to play athletics made him feel like an outcast. Of this time in his life, Rice said, &quot;I had money, had a nice car, was white. I could have fit in, but I knew I didn&#x27;t belong. I knew I didn&#x27;t share their dreams and ambitions and their values&quot;. These experiences inspired his first novel, &quot;A Density of Souls&quot;. 

Rice began visiting gay bars and clubs during his senior year of high school, but he did not come out to his parents until he met his first boyfriend. His father accepted Rice&#x27;s sexuality, but his mother initially believed he was bisexual based on his past relationships.

Rice went on to attend Brown University, an experience which inspired his second novel, &quot;The Snow Garden&quot;. During his freshman year, he intended to become an actor. He transferred to Tisch School of the Arts where he studied Dramatic Writing. He did not graduate from either school; he instead moved to Los Angeles to explore writing screenplays.

==Career ==
Some of Rice&#x27;s works contain descriptions of contemporary American life for the gay male. When asked in 2002 about &quot;being pegged a &#x27;gay writer, he replied:
Rice is proud of the reaction of the gay community to his writing, explaining &quot;it was incredibly rewarding when I got a huge positive response from the character Stephen in &quot;A Density of Souls.&quot; More than a thousand young gay men contacted me and said that I captured what it was like for them going through those years. That means everything to me.&quot;

=== Early Novels ===
In December 1998, Anne Rice had a medical crisis and nearly died when she fell into a diabetic coma. Her son Christopher wrote his first novel, &quot;A Density of Souls&quot;, upon returning home to New Orleans during her recuperation. Published the following year, &quot;Souls&quot; generated buzz in the gay and mainstream press, and became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. His second novel, &quot;The Snow Garden&quot; received a Lambda Literary Award for Best Gay Men&#x27;s Mystery. For many years, Rice wrote a regular column for the LGBT-related biweekly news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot; called &quot;Coastal Disturbances,&quot; in which he discussed various topics.

=== Supernatural Horror ===
Early in his career, Rice distinguished himself by saying that unlike his famous mother, he did not write horror novels, instead considering his books to be thrillers. However, as years went by, Rice became more comfortable experimenting in different genres, exploring his own version of the supernatural with works such as &quot;The Heavens Rise&quot;, published in 2013, and &quot;The Vines&quot;. Both of these novels were met with critical acclaim, and each was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a Novel, but they lost to &quot;Dr. Sleep&quot; by Stephen King and &quot;Blood Kin&quot; by Steve Rasnic Tem, in their respective years. On the publication of &quot;The Heavens Rise&quot; in 2013, Rice told The Advocate magazine that part of his motivation for writing the novel came from a desire to tell a New Orleans-set story with a more sympathetic ensemble of characters than the one featured in his debut, &quot;A Density of Souls&quot;. &quot;I said my first novel put the city through such hell, both figuratively and literally, at least certain neighborhoods. But honestly, what happened to me is that I grew up. And I saw my perspective on the city and some of its communities in &quot;A Density of Souls&quot; to be youthful and unforgiving. And I had a desire to back and write a kinder, gentler New Orleans story, which, because I&#x27;m a Rice, turned into a horror novel.&quot;

=== The TDPS Network ===
In 2012, Rice launched a streaming Internet radio show called &quot;The Dinner Party Show&quot; with Eric Shaw Quinn, his producing partner and co-host, who was known for having ghost written two books by celebrity Pamela Anderson and a 1992 novel about gay adoption called &quot;Say Uncle&quot;. The show describes itself as &quot;the Internet&#x27;s first live comedy variety show&quot; and became known for its hard-hitting satire and celebrity interviews Guests have included Patricia Cornwell, Dan Savage, transgender activist Chaz Bono and &quot;Tales of the City&quot; author Armistead Maupin. In 2019, after placing the show on hiatus to begin development of The Vampire Chronicles television series, Rice and Quinn returned with a new podcast entitled &quot;TDPS Presents CHRISTOPHER &amp; ERIC&quot;, which included a regular series focused on true crime television documentaries they called Christopher &amp; Eric&#x27;s True Crime TV Club.

=== Erotic Romance ===
In 2014, Rice announced through his social media channels that he was scheduled to publish several works of erotic romance. The first of them, &quot;The Flame&quot;, was published in November 2014 as part of the 1,001 Dark Nights series.

In 2021, Rice announced a new &quot;acknowledged&quot; pen name devoted to tales of romance between men, C. Travis Rice. Between 2021 and 2023, he published the first three novels in his Sapphire Cove series, &quot;Sapphire Sunset&quot;, &quot;Sapphire Spring&quot; and &quot;Sapphire Storm&quot;. &quot;After years of being pressured to convert my gay men into either a heroine&#x27;s brother or best friend,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Sapphire Cove became a place to tell the stories I&#x27;d always wanted to tell about the men I&#x27;ve loved.&quot; A fourth novel in the series, &quot;Sapphire Dawn&quot;, was published in 2024.

=== Collaborations with Anne Rice ===
On November 26, 2016, Anne Rice announced that the film and television rights to her entire Vampire Chronicles franchise had reverted to her after unsuccessful attempts to launch them as a film franchise with Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment. Her announcement included the detail that she and Christopher would be executive producers on a planned TV series based on the franchise.

On February 28, 2017, the Rices announced their first novel written in collaboration, &quot;Ramses the Damned: The Passion of Cleopatra&quot;. It was published on November 21, 2017. Of the collaboration with his mother, Christopher said, &quot;I had to be taught how to write...scenes from an immortal&#x27;s point of view in a way that fits with an Anne Rice book because immortals don&#x27;t engage or interact with everyday ordinary stimuli the way we would. They have an absence of fear and an absence or reactivity, and that&#x27;s something Mom really counseled me on.&quot; Anne would publicly state that Christopher was largely responsible for inventing the origin story for The Elixir of Life, first introduced in the first novel in the series and responsible for giving Ramses and Cleopatra their immortality. Anne would also reveal that Bektaten, an ancient African queen responsible for inventing the elixir, was almost entirely Christopher&#x27;s invention. Publishers Weekly called &quot;Ramses The Damned: The Passion of Cleopatra&quot; a &quot;slick sequel&quot; to The Mummy, noting that its &quot;immortals gifted with virtual indestructibility scheme as nastily against one another as the similarly endowed characters in Anne Rice&#x27;s celebrated Vampire Chronicles.&quot; The publication added, &quot;In their first literary collaboration, the Rices, mother and son, configure these subplots into an entertaining soap opera replete with romantic alliances, betrayals, and ends left tantalizingly loose as grist for sequels.&quot;

In early 2020, Anne revealed she had sold the studio rights to both The Vampire Chronicles book series as well as her Lives of the Mayfair Witches series to AMC Studios, the home of such shows as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and &quot;Killing Eve&quot;, with her and Christopher as executive producers on all films and television series produced under the deal. In a May 13, 2020 announcement of the deal Christopher Rice said, &quot;AMC Studios is responsible for creating some of the most iconic television series of the modern era and has, at times, single-handedly defined this era we call &#x27;peak TV&#x27;. All the members of Team Anne, including my long-term producing partner, New York Times Bestselling novelist Eric Shaw Quinn, are both thrilled and comforted to know that some of our most cherished kin, from the vampire Lestat and the witch Rowan Mayfair, to the paranormal investigators at the Order of the Talamasca and the powerful spirit Lasher, are now safely in the hands of these vastly accomplished innovators who possess both global reach and deep reservoirs of experience.&quot;

<doc id="320701" wikidata="Q168359" url="?curid=320701" title="Jean Marais">
<text>Jean-Alfred Villain-Marais (11 December 1913 – 8 November 1998), known professionally as Jean Marais (), was a French actor, film director, theatre director, painter, sculptor, visual artist, writer and photographer. He performed in over 100 films and was the lover, muse and friend of acclaimed director Jean Cocteau. In 1996, he was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his contributions to French cinema.

==Early life==
A native of Cherbourg, France, Marais was a son of Alfred Emmanuel Victor Paul Villain-Marais, a veterinarian, and his wife, the former Aline Marie Louise Vassord. Having recently lost a two-year-old daughter Madeleine, Aline was very disappointed when she gave birth to a boy. She came to accept him but until Jean was six or seven years old his mother raised him as if he were a girl, dressing him like one and giving him dolls to play with. Sometimes Aline was mysteriously absent from home. When he was eighteen, Marais became aware that his mother was a kleptomaniac and that she had been imprisoned for several months or even years in her lifetime.

==Career==
===Early films===
Marais&#x27; first role was an uncredited bit in &quot;Song of the Streets&quot; (1933) and he was in &quot;Etienne&quot; (1933). Filmmaker Marcel L&#x27;Herbier put him in &quot;The Sparrowhawk&quot; (1933) with Charles Boyer; &quot;The Scandal&quot; (1934), with Gaby Morlay; &quot;Happiness&quot; (1934) again with Boyer, &quot;The Venturer&quot; (1934) with Victor Francen; &quot;The New Men&quot; (1934) with Harry Baur; and &quot;Nights of Fire&quot; (1937) with Morlay and Francen.

Marcel Carné gave Marais a small role in &quot;Bizarre, Bizarre&quot; (1937) and the actor was in &quot;Abused Confidence&quot; (1937) by Henri Decoin; &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1938), a biopic of Paul I of Russia with Baur, directed by Maurice Tourneur; and &quot;Remontons les Champs-Élysées&quot; (1938) directed by Sacha Guitry.

===Jean Cocteau===
These were small roles. Marais also appeared on stage. He was in a 1937 stage production of &quot;Oedipe&quot; directed by Charles Dullin, where he was seen by Jean Cocteau. Marais impressed Cocteau, who cast the actor in his play &quot;Les Chevaliers de la table ronde&quot;.

Marais appeared in Cocteau&#x27;s play &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot; (1938), supposedly based on Marais&#x27; home life, which was a great success.

Marais had bigger film parts in &quot;The Pavilion Burns&quot; (1941) directed by Jacques de Baroncelli, and &quot;The Four Poster&quot; (1942) directed by Roland Tual.

On stage he appeared in &quot;La Machine à ecrire&quot; (1941) by Cocteau and he directed and designed Racine&#x27;s &quot;Britannicus&quot; (1941). He performed briefly with the Comédie-Française, then left acting for a time for fight in Alsace with the Free French Forces, winning the Croix de Guerre.

===Stardom===
Marais&#x27; first film as leading man was &quot;L&#x27;Éternel retour&quot; (1943), a re-telling of Tristan and Isolde set in 1940s France, written by Jean Cocteau. It was directed by Jean Delannoy and co-starred Madeleine Sologne. It was popular and made him a star.

Marais was the male lead in &quot;Voyage Without Hope&quot; (1943) with Simone Renant directed by Christian-Jaque.

Christian-Jaque also directed Marais in &quot;Carmen&quot; (1944) with Viviane Romance. This was one of the most popular films in France when it was released.

===&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and Jean Cocteau===
Marais became a star in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946), written and directed by Cocteau.

He performed in a popular revival of Cocteau&#x27;s 1938 play &quot;Les Parents terribles&quot; on stage.

Marais&#x27; next films were &quot;The Royalists&quot; (1947), a historical adventure film directed by Henri Calef from a novel by Balzac; and &quot;Ruy Blas&quot; (1948) with Danielle Darrieux, from a play by Victor Hugo and script by Cocteau, directed by Pierre Billon.

Marais&#x27; second film with Cocteau as director was &quot;The Eagle with Two Heads&quot; (1948) with Edwige Feuillère. He did &quot;To the Eyes of Memory&quot; (1948) with Michele Morgan for director Jean Delannoy, a big commercial success, then &quot;Les Parents Terribles&quot; (1949) for Cocteau again.

Marais was reunited with Delannoy for &quot;The Secret of Mayerling&quot; (1949), about the Mayerling incident. He did &quot;Orpheus&quot; (1950) with Cocteau, which was soon regarded as a classic.

===Post-Cocteau stardom===
Marais and Morgan were in &quot;The Glass Castle&quot; (1950) directed by René Clément. Marais did two films for Yves Allegret: &quot;Miracles Only Happen Once&quot; (1951) with Alida Valli and &quot;Leathernose&quot; (1952).

Marais was in &quot;L&#x27;appel du destin&quot; (1953) for Georges Lacombe; &quot;The Lovers of Midnight&quot; (1953) for Roger Richebé; &quot;Voice of Silence&quot; (1953), an Italian film from G. W. Pabst; &quot;Inside a Girls&#x27; Dormitory&quot; (1953); &quot;Julietta&quot; (1953) for Marc Allegret with Dany Robin and Jeanne Moreau; the all-star &quot;Boum sur Paris&quot; (1953); and &quot;The Faith Healer&quot; (1954).

Marais starred in a version of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1954) that was hugely popular.

He did a comedy, &quot;Friend of the Family&quot; (1964), then had a huge box office success with &quot;Fantomas&quot; (1964), playing the villain and hero, under the direction of Hunebelle.

His later work included &quot;Emmenez-moi au théâtre&quot;; &quot;Parking&quot; (1985) directed by Demy; &quot;Lien de parenté&quot; (1986); &quot;Les enfants du naufrageur&quot; (1992); &quot;Dis Papa, raconte-moi là-bas&quot; (1993); &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1995 film), directed by Claude Lelouch; and &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot; (1996), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

He performed on stage until his 80s, also working as a sculptor. His sculpture &quot;Le passe muraille&quot; (&quot;The Walker Through Walls&quot;) can be seen in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris.

In 1985, he was the head of the jury at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. He was featured in the 1995 documentary &quot;Screening at the Majestic&quot;, which is included on the 2003 DVD release of the restored print of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marais was Jean Cocteau&#x27;s lover from 1937 to 1947, his muse and longtime friend. After Cocteau&#x27;s death, Marais wrote a memoir of Cocteau, &quot;L&#x27;Inconcevable Jean Cocteau&quot;, attributing authorship to &quot;Cocteau-Marais&quot;. He also wrote an autobiography, &quot;Histoires de ma vie&quot;, published in 1975. From 1948 until 1959, his companion was the American dancer George Reich. He is rumored to have been among the lovers of Umberto II of Italy.

In the early 1960s, Marais adopted a young man, Serge Ayala, who eventually took the name Serge Villain-Marais. This adopted son, who became a singer and an actor, committed suicide in 2012 at age 69 after an inheritance litigation and bouts of loneliness and depression.

===Death===
Marais died from cardiovascular disease in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes in 1998. He is interred in the Village cemetery at Vallauris, near Antibes.

==In popular culture==
The character Tragicomix, in the comic book &quot;Asterix the Legionary&quot; of 1967, has his characteristics based on Jean Marais.

His life story became the inspiration for the 1980 François Truffaut film &quot;The Last Metro&quot;.

In 1983, a still shot of him from Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Orphée&quot; was featured on the cover of The Smiths&#x27; &quot;This Charming Man.&quot;

<doc id="320706" wikidata="Q1176577" url="?curid=320706" title="David Sedaris">
<text>David Raymond Sedaris ( ; born December 26, 1956) is an American humorist, comedian, author, and radio contributor. He was publicly recognized in 1992 when National Public Radio broadcast his essay &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;. He published his first collection of essays and short stories, &quot;Barrel Fever&quot;, in 1994. His next book, &quot;Naked&quot; (1997), became his first of a series of &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestsellers, and his 2000 collection &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; won the Thurber Prize for American Humor.

Much of Sedaris&#x27;s humor is autobiographical and self-deprecating and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, his Greek heritage, homosexuality, jobs, education, drug use, and obsessive behaviors, as well as his life in France, London, New York, and the South Downs in England. He is the brother and writing collaborator of actress Amy Sedaris.

In 2019, Sedaris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

== Early life and education ==
Sedaris was born in Johnson City, New York, to Sharon Elizabeth (née Leonard) (d. 1991) and Louis Harry &quot;Lou&quot; Sedaris (1923–2021), an IBM engineer. His mother was Anglo-American. His father was born in the U.S. to immigrants from Apidea in Greece. His mother was Protestant, and his father was Greek Orthodox, the faith in which David was raised.

The Sedaris family moved when David was young, and he grew up in a suburban area of Raleigh, the second oldest child of six. His siblings, from oldest to youngest, are Lisa, Gretchen, Amy, Tiffany, and Paul (&quot;the Rooster&quot;). Tiffany died by suicide in 2013, a subject David discusses in the essay &quot;Now We Are Five&quot;, which was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and included in his 2018 essay collection &quot;Calypso&quot;.

After graduating from Jesse O. Sanderson High School in Raleigh, Sedaris briefly attended Western Carolina University before transferring to, and dropping out of, Kent State University in 1977. In his teens and twenties, David dabbled in visual and performance art. He describes his lack of success in several of his essays.

Sedaris moved to Chicago in 1983, and graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1987.

== Career ==
While working odd jobs in Raleigh, Chicago, and New York City, Sedaris was discovered in a Chicago club by radio host Ira Glass. Sedaris was reading a diary he had kept since 1977. Impressed with his work, Glass asked him to appear on his weekly local program, &quot;The Wild Room&quot;. Referring to the opportunity, Sedaris said, &quot;I owe everything to Ira... My life just changed completely, like someone waved a magic wand.&quot; Sedaris&#x27;s success on &quot;The Wild Room&quot; led to his National Public Radio debut on December 23, 1992, when he read a radio essay on &quot;Morning Edition&quot; titled &quot;Santaland Diaries,&quot; which described his purported experiences as an elf at Macy&#x27;s department store during Christmas in New York.

&quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; was a success with listeners and made Sedaris what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a minor phenomenon.&quot; He began recording a monthly segment for NPR, which was based on his diary entries and was edited and produced by Glass, and he also signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown and Company. In 1993, Sedaris told &quot;The New York Times&quot; he was publishing his first book, a collection of stories and essays, and he had 70 pages written of his second book, a novel &quot;about a man who keeps a diary and whom Mr. Sedaris described as &#x27;not me, but a lot like me&#x27;.&quot;

=== Collections and mainstream success ===
In 1994, Sedaris published &quot;Barrel Fever&quot;, a collection of stories and essays. He became a frequent contributor when Ira Glass began a weekly hour-long PRI/Chicago Public Radio show, &quot;This American Life&quot;, in 1995. Sedaris began writing essays for &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 1997, he published another collection of essays, &quot;Naked&quot;, which won the Randy Shilts Award for Gay Non-Fiction from Publishing Triangle in 1998.

&quot;Naked&quot; and his subsequent four essay collections, &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot; (1997), &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; (2000), &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot; (2004), and &quot;When You Are Engulfed in Flames&quot; (2008), became &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Sellers.

&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; was written mostly in France, over seven months, and it was published in 2000 to &quot;practically unanimous rave reviews.&quot; For that book, Sedaris won the 2001 Thurber Prize for American Humor.

In April 2001, &quot;Variety&quot; reported Sedaris had sold the &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; film rights to director Wayne Wang, who was adapting four stories from the book for Columbia Pictures. Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to &quot;get out of it,&quot; after he and his sister worried how their family might be portrayed. He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay &quot;Repeat After Me.&quot; Sedaris recounted that Wang was &quot;a real prince... I didn&#x27;t want him to be mad at me, but he was so grown up about it. I never saw how it could be turned into a movie anyway.&quot;

In 2004, Sedaris published &quot;Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim&quot;, which reached number 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Nonfiction Best Seller List in June of that year. The audiobook of &quot;Dress Your Family&quot;, read by Sedaris, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. The same year, Sedaris was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album for his recording &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall&quot;. In March 2006, Ira Glass said that Sedaris&#x27;s next book would be a collection of animal fables; during that year, Sedaris included several animal fables in his US book tour, and three of his fables were broadcast on &quot;This American Life&quot;.

In September 2007, a new Sedaris collection was announced for publication the following year. The collection&#x27;s working title was &quot;All the Beauty You Will Ever Need&quot;, but Sedaris retitled it &quot;Indefinite Leave to Remain&quot; and finally settled on the title &quot;When You Are Engulfed in Flames&quot;. Although at least one news source assumed the book would be fables, Sedaris said in October 2007 that the collection might include a &quot;surprisingly brief story about [his] decision to quit smoking,&quot; along with other stories about various topics, including chimpanzees at a typing school, and people visiting [him] in France. The book was described as his darkest, as it dealt with themes of death and dying.

In December 2008, Sedaris received an honorary doctorate from Binghamton University.

In April 2010, BBC Radio 4 aired &quot;Meet David Sedaris&quot;, a four-part series of essays, which Sedaris read before a live audience. A second series of six programs began airing on BBC Radio 4 Extra in June 2011, with a third series beginning in September 2012. In July 2017, the sixth series was aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra. In 2010, he released a collection of stories, &quot;Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary&quot;. Sedaris released a collection of essays, &quot;Let&#x27;s Explore Diabetes with Owls&quot;, in 2013 and, in 2017, published a collection of his 1977–2002 diaries, &quot;Theft By Finding&quot;. Also in 2013, the film adaptation of an essay from &quot;Naked&quot; was released as a feature-length movie, &quot;C.O.G.&quot;

In July 2011, Sedaris&#x27;s essay &quot;Chicken Toenails, Anyone&quot;, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, garnered some criticism over concerns that it was insensitive towards China and Chinese culture.

A frequent guest of late-night US talk show host Craig Ferguson, in April 2012, Sedaris joined Ferguson and the cast of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late, Late Show&quot; in Scotland for a theme week filmed in and around Cumbernauld and in Edinburgh. The five weeknight episodes aired in May 2012.

Sedaris&#x27;s ninth book, &quot;Let&#x27;s Explore Diabetes with Owls&quot;, was released in April 2013.

In 2014, he participated in &quot;Do I Sound Gay?&quot;, a documentary film by David Thorpe about stereotypes of gay men&#x27;s speech patterns.

He appeared along with his sister Amy as special guest judges on season 8, episode 8, of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. He also appeared as a guest in the Adult Swim television series &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;.

Sedaris guest starred on the Netflix animated comedy-drama series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; as the mother of Princess Carolyn, voiced by Amy Sedaris.

In 2019, Sedaris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. A greatest-hits compilation of his essays and short fiction entitled &quot;The Best of Me&quot; was released in November 2020.

In 2022, he published &quot;Happy Go Lucky&quot;, where he reflected on his relationship with his recently deceased father.

=== Truth of nonfiction work ===
In 2007, in an article in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Alexander S. Heard stated that much of Sedaris&#x27;s work is insufficiently factual to justify being marketed as nonfiction. Several published responses to Heard&#x27;s article argued that Sedaris&#x27;s readers are aware that his descriptions and stories are intentionally exaggerated and manipulated to maximize comic effect, while others used the controversy as a springboard for discussing the liberties publishers are willing to take when calling books &quot;nonfiction&quot;.

Subsequently, in the wake of a controversy involving Mike Daisey&#x27;s dramatizing and embellishing his personal experiences at Chinese factories, during an excerpt from his theatrical monologue for &quot;This American Life&quot;, new attention has been paid to the veracity of Sedaris&#x27;s nonfiction stories. NPR labels stories from Sedaris, such as &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot;, as fiction, while &quot;This American Life&quot; fact checks stories, to the extent that memories and long-ago conversations can be checked. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; already subjects nonfiction stories written for that magazine to its comprehensive fact-checking policy.

=== The Talent Family ===
Sedaris has written several plays with his sister, actress Amy Sedaris, under the name &quot;The Talent Family&quot;. These include &quot;Stump the Host&quot; (1993), &quot;Stitches&quot; (1994), &quot;One Woman Shoe&quot;, which co-starred David Rakoff (1995)&lt;ref name=&quot;Brantley, NYT, 1/26/1995&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;The Little Frieda Mysteries&quot; (1997). All were produced and presented by Meryl Vladimer while she was the artistic director of &quot;the CLUB&quot; at La MaMa, E.T.C. &quot;The Book of Liz&quot; (2001) was written by Sedaris and his sister, Amy and produced by Drama Dept. at The Greenwich Theater in New York.

=== &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ===
Sedaris has contributed over 40 essays to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine and blog.

== Personal life ==
Sedaris lives with his longtime partner, painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick. The two met in New York City in 1991 and in 1998, they moved to France together, later relocating to England. Sedaris frequently mentions Hamrick in his stories, and describes the two of them as the type of couple who will not be married.

Sedaris currently divides his time between Rackham, West Sussex, England, and New York City. In 2013, he purchased a beach house on Emerald Isle, North Carolina; many of the stories in his 2018 collection &quot;Calypso&quot; are set there.

Sedaris is known for regularly spending hours removing litter from roads and highways near Rackham. Because of this hobby, he is known locally as &quot;Pig Pen&quot;; he also has a waste vehicle named after him.

<doc id="320708" wikidata="Q324114" url="?curid=320708" title="Scott Thompson (actor)">
<text>John Scott Thompson (born June 12, 1959) is a Canadian actor and comedian, best known as member of the comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall and for playing Brian on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;.

== Early life ==
Thompson was born in North Bay, Ontario and grew up in Brampton. Named for his uncle, he later dropped the name &quot;John&quot; to simplify his name for the stage. He is the second oldest of the five children in his family.

He attended Brampton Centennial Secondary School, and was a witness to the 1975 Brampton Centennial Secondary School shooting. He enrolled at York University but in his third year was asked to leave for being &quot;disruptive&quot;. He joined the comedy troupe The Love Cats, where he met Mark McKinney.

== Career ==

In 1984, Thompson became a member of The Kids in the Hall, whose eponymous sketch comedy series aired starting 1989 on the CBC in Canada and on HBO in the United States, but moved to CBS for its fourth and fifth seasons. Openly gay, Thompson became best known on the show for his monologues as &quot;alpha queen&quot; socialite Buddy Cole, and his appearances as Queen Elizabeth II, secretary Cathy, businessman Danny Husk, suburban housewife Fran, actress Francesca Fiore, and the demented old man in the popular &quot;Love and Sausages&quot; sketch.

Concurrently with &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, Thompson and his writing colleague Paul Bellini collaborated in a queercore punk band called Mouth Congress.

During the mid-1990s Thompson ran an interactive website, developed by his younger brother Craig and called . It had a live-chat area, voting and comedy espionage and sold Buddy Cole T-shirts and video tapes of comedy sketches.

He also appeared regularly on &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; as Hank Kingsley&#x27;s personal assistant Brian, and made numerous guest appearances on other television series, including &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and &quot;Train 48&quot;. Thompson hosted a reality television program in Canada called &quot;My Fabulous Gay Wedding&quot;. Thompson defended Mordecai Richler&#x27;s novel &quot;Cocksure&quot; in &quot;Canada Reads 2006&quot;. He has continued to tour, and act in numerous movies and on TV. He joined the other Kids in the Hall to tour as recently as 2014, guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, and performed in the project &quot;Death Comes to Town&quot; (2010) with fellow KITH members Dave Foley, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, and Kevin McDonald. He had a recurring role in the NBC series &quot;Hannibal&quot;, playing Jimmy Price, an FBI crime scene investigator.

Thompson published a humour book, &quot;Buddy Babylon: The Autobiography of Buddy Cole&quot;, and a graphic novel, &quot;The Hollow Planet&quot;, based on characters from &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, and has written and performed two one-man shows. In 2014, Thompson, in character as Buddy Cole, did a series of reports on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; as the program&#x27;s correspondent for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

In 2015, Bellini and Thompson uploaded all of their Mouth Congress recordings to Bandcamp, and they reunited the following year for several live shows to promote the release. They launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund a documentary film about the band; that film, &quot;Mouth Congress&quot;, premiered at the Kingston Canadian Film Festival in 2021.

Around this time, Thompson performed his Buddy Cole monologues at the Portland Queer Comedy Festival.

In 2018, Thompson launched &quot;Après le Déluge – The Buddy Cole Monologues&quot;, a one-man show in character as Buddy Cole.

== Personal life ==
=== Firebombing ===
In 2000, Thompson was living with his boyfriend, French documentarian Joel Soler, in Hollywood. Soler had smuggled footage out of Iraq to make an E! News-style satiric political documentary comedy, &quot;Uncle Saddam&quot;, about the eccentricities in the home life of Saddam Hussein and his family, which bubbled behind Hussein&#x27;s dictatorial façade. Thompson wrote the narration for the movie, which was read by actor Wallace Langham. Following the movie&#x27;s release, Thompson and Soler&#x27;s West Hollywood home was firebombed on November 1, 2000. Thompson has discussed the details of this incident in interviews with Jesse Brown of &quot;Canadaland&quot; and fellow Canadian comic Elvira Kurt, as being inspiration for his future show &quot;The Lowest Show on Earth&quot;. In the interview with Kurt, he says of the attack, &quot;We were sleeping and a group came to our home. They filled our giant garbage cans with gasoline and set them on fire on our front lawn. They had buckets of red paint. They covered the house with it so it dripped off like blood. They put a note in the front hall that said, &#x27;In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate, burn this Satanic film or you will be dead&#x27;. They underlined &quot;dead&quot; just in case we weren&#x27;t freaked out enough&quot;.

This, along with many other incidents throughout Thompson&#x27;s life, including the 1975 Brampton Centennial Secondary School shooting at his Brampton high school, led him to process incidents of terror on micro- and macrocosmic levels through his one-man comedy show &quot;The Lowest Show on Earth&quot;. Thompson went on tour with this show and secured a spot in New York, off-Broadway. The posters—featuring Thompson lying supine on the ground with a big wad of semen dripping down the side of his face—went up around the city on September 10, 2001. The following day, the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center made the one-man show&#x27;s difficult material impossible to talk about.

=== Health ===
In March 2009, Thompson was diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin&#x27;s gastric lymphoma. He completed six rounds of chemotherapy and one month of radiation and is now cancer free.

<doc id="320709" wikidata="Q5271601" url="?curid=320709" title="Death of Diane Whipple">
<text>Diane Alexis Whipple (January 31, 1967 – January 26, 2001) was an American lacrosse player and college coach. She was killed in a dog attack in San Francisco on January 26, 2001. The dogs involved were two Presa Canarios belonging to Paul Schneider, a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood serving three life sentences in state prison. The dogs were looked after by Schneider&#x27;s attorneys, Robert Noel and Marjorie Knoller, a husband and wife who lived in the same apartment building as Whipple. After the fatal attack, the state brought criminal charges against the attorneys. Noel, who was not present during the attack, was convicted of manslaughter. Knoller, who was present, was charged with implied-malice second-degree murder and convicted by the jury. Knoller&#x27;s murder conviction, an unusual result for an unintended dog attack, was rejected by the trial judge but ultimately upheld. The case clarified the meaning of implied malice murder.

== Early life ==
Whipple was born in Princeton, New Jersey. She grew up and attended high school in Manhasset, New York, on Long Island. She was raised primarily by her grandparents, and was a gifted athlete from a young age. She became a two-time All-American lacrosse player in high school, and later at Penn State. She was twice a member of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Lacrosse World Cup team.

Whipple later moved to San Francisco, and came within seconds of qualifying for the U.S. 1996 Olympics team in track and field, for the 800 meters. However, she did not compete at the 1996 Olympic Team Trials. Instead, she became the lacrosse coach at Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California in Moraga, California.

At the time of her death, Whipple lived in San Francisco&#x27;s Pacific Heights with her domestic partner of six years, Sharon Smith.

== Perpetrators ==
Attorneys Marjorie Fran Knoller (born June 20, 1955) and Robert Edward Noel (June 22, 1941 – June 22, 2018) were caregivers to the dogs that killed Whipple.

After attending Brooklyn College, Knoller received her J.D. degree from McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California. Noel graduated from the University of Baltimore Law School in 1967.

Noel and Knoller married in 1989. Starting in the mid-1990s, they ran their law office out of a converted closet in their Pacific Heights apartment in San Francisco.

In 2000, Knoller and Noel obtained their two Presa Canarios, named Bane and Hera, through their relationship with a pair of Pelican Bay State Prison inmates, Paul &#x27;Cornfed&#x27; Schneider (whom they had legally adopted as their son), and Dale Bretches, both members of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Knoller and Noel had first met Schneider at a trial. Bane was male and Hera female; by January 2001, Bane weighed 140 pounds and Hera close to 100 pounds.

== Attack ==

On January 26, 2001, while returning home with bags of groceries, Whipple was attacked by the two dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. Knoller was taking the dogs out of their apartment at the same time Whipple returned. The dogs escaped her control and attacked Whipple.

Schneider and his cellmate Dale Bretches were attempting to start an illegal Presa Canario dog-fighting business from prison. They initially asked acquaintances Janet Coumbs and Hard Times Kennel owner/breeder James Kolber of Akron, Ohio, to raise the dogs during their incarceration. Against Kolber&#x27;s advice, Coumbs chained the dogs in a remote corner of the farm, which caused them to become even more aggressive. After Coumbs fell out of favor with Schneider, attorneys Noel and Knoller agreed to take possession of the dogs. They had become acquainted with Schneider while doing legal work for prisoners, and had adopted Schneider (then age 38) as their legal son a few days before the mauling.

Just prior to the attack, Knoller was taking the dogs up to the roof; Bane, and possibly Hera, whose role in the mauling has never been firmly established, attacked Whipple in the hallway. Whipple suffered a total of 77 wounds to every part of her body except her scalp and bottoms of her feet. Another neighbor called 911 after hearing Whipple&#x27;s screams. Whipple died hours later at San Francisco General Hospital from &quot;loss of blood from multiple traumatic injuries (dog bite wounds)&quot;.

Bane was euthanized immediately after the attack; Hera was seized and later euthanized in January 2002.

Whipple&#x27;s memorial service at St. Mary&#x27;s College, held on February 1, 2001, was attended by more than 400 people.

== Legal proceedings against dog owners ==
In March 2001, a grand jury indicted Knoller and Noel. Knoller was indicted for second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, Noel was indicted for involuntary manslaughter, and &quot;both also face[d] felony charges of keeping a mischievous dog&quot;.

The trial by jury, which began in January 2002, &quot;was moved to Los Angeles because of extensive publicity in the Bay Area.&quot;

At trial, Knoller argued that she had attempted to defend Whipple during the attack. However, witnesses testified that Knoller and Noel had repeatedly refused to control the dogs; a professional dog walker testified that, after she told Noel to muzzle his dogs, he told her to &quot;shut up&quot; and called her offensive names. An acquaintance of Noel&#x27;s testified that Noel did not apologize after Hera bit him a year before the fatal attack. Ultimately, the jury found both Noel and Knoller guilty of involuntary manslaughter and owning a mischievous animal that caused the death of a human being, and found Knoller guilty of second-degree murder. Their convictions were based on the argument that they knew the dogs were aggressive towards other people and that they did not take sufficient precautions. Whether they had actually trained the dogs to attack and fight remained unclear.

Although the jury found Knoller guilty of second degree murder, trial judge James Warren granted Knoller a new trial on the second-degree murder conviction; the judge believed the appropriate standard for implied malice murder required that Knoller knew taking the dog into the hall involved a high probability of death. Although the judge granted a new trial for the second degree murder charge, he sentenced Knoller to four years in prison for the lesser-included involuntary manslaughter on July 15, 2002. The state appealed the judge&#x27;s action and sought to reinstate the second degree murder conviction.

After Knoller&#x27;s and Noel&#x27;s convictions in 2002, the State Bar of California suspended their law licenses. Knoller resigned from the bar in January 2007; Noel was disbarred in February. On September 14, 2003, Noel was released from prison.

By 2004, both Knoller and Noel had served their terms for the manslaughter convictions, and Knoller was out on bail while her second-degree murder conviction was under appeal.

In May 2005, the state appellate court reversed the judge&#x27;s grant of new second-degree murder trial for Knoller. The appellate court ruled that implied malice murder did not require knowledge of a high probability of death but rather just a conscious disregard of serious bodily injury. The appellate court returned the case to the lower court to reconsider Knoller&#x27;s motion for a new trial using the serious bodily injury standard for implied malice murder.
Knoller appealed the appellate court decision to the Supreme Court of California. On June 1, 2007, the California Supreme Court rejected the Court of Appeal&#x27;s decision and ruled that implied malice murder required proof that a defendant acted with &quot;conscious disregard&quot; of the danger to human life. The California Supreme Court held that the trial court&#x27;s standard for implied malice murder (which required a high probability of death) was too strict and the appellate court&#x27;s standard (which required only serious bodily injury rather than a danger to human life) was too broad. The court remanded the case to the trial court to reconsider whether to allow the second-degree murder conviction to stand in light of this new reasoning. The San Francisco Superior Court reinstated the conviction for second-degree murder, and on September 22, 2008, the court sentenced Knoller to 15 years to life.

Knoller then appealed the trial court&#x27;s actions. On August 23, 2010, the First District Court of Appeal unanimously upheld Knoller&#x27;s conviction, finding that she acted with a conscious disregard for human life when her Presa Canario escaped and killed Whipple. The California Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal of that decision. Knoller is currently serving her sentence at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility in Chowchilla.

In November 2015, Knoller petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overturn her second-degree murder conviction. In February 2016, the Ninth Circuit upheld Knoller&#x27;s second degree murder conviction.

On February 7, 2019, California commissioners denied Knoller&#x27;s first application for parole. Her December 2021 parole hearing was first postponed until August 29, 2022, then again until February 15, 2023. Her parole was denied. The two member panel cited her prison record and stated she would be a danger to society if released. She will again be eligible for parole in 2026, at which point she will be 70-71 years of age.

Whipple&#x27;s partner, Sharon Smith, also succeeded in suing Knoller and Noel for $1.5 million in damages. The civil case was notable in that the San Francisco Superior Court ruled in July 2001 that Smith was entitled to bring suit as Whipple&#x27;s domestic partner under the Equal Protection Clause, against the defense&#x27;s argument that a same-sex unmarried partner did not have standing. She donated some of the money to Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California to fund the women&#x27;s lacrosse team.

== Death of Robert Noel ==
Noel lived in relative obscurity following his release from prison, working for a time as a baker in Fairfield, California. By 2016, increasing health problems led to his living out of a van for some time before he relocated to the San Diego area.

Noel died of heart failure in a La Jolla nursing home on June 22, 2018, the day of his 77th birthday. In her 2023 parole hearing, Knoller stated that she did not know about Noel&#x27;s death until three months after it happened.

<text>James Thaddeus Goad (born 1960 or 1961) is an American author and publisher. Goad co-authored and published the zine &quot;Answer Me!&quot; and &quot;The Redneck Manifesto&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Early life===
Goad grew up in Philadelphia, describing himself as a loner, misanthrope and weirdo. He attended a Catholic school run by nuns. He experienced violent treatment from his parents and bullies at his school, eventually learning to fight back. Goad moved to New York City to study acting and was accepted to study at New York University under Stella Adler.

===1980s–90s===

Goad graduated in 1985 with a B.A. in Journalism from Temple University while living in New Jersey. In the early 1980s, Goad met Debbie Rosalie, who was eight years older, in New York. They relocated to Los Angeles and were married in 1987. Goad worked at the &quot;Los Angeles Reader&quot;, covering local news, but wished to cover more fringe subjects, so the couple began publishing their own magazine, &quot;Answer Me!&quot;

Around 1994, the couple moved to Portland, Oregon and Goad devoted his time to writing. In May 1997, Goad began dating then-stripper Anne &quot;Skye&quot; Ryan about the time that Debbie was diagnosed with the ovarian cancer that later killed her. Goad described Ryan as &quot;Sweet Dracula girl&quot; and as being &quot;...fifteen years younger than me and a thousand times more fucked-up.&quot; In November 1997, Debbie was granted a restraining order against Goad, after stating that he had hit, kicked, and spit on her and threatened to kill her. They divorced in December, 1997.

In May 1998, Goad and Ryan had a fight in Goad&#x27;s car outside of Portland. Goad left Ryan by the side of the road, and fled to Washington state. When police met Ryan in a hospital emergency room, she had a blackened eye that was swollen shut, &quot;bite marks on her hand and she was bleeding in several places.&quot; Goad was charged with assault and kidnapping, facing a potential 25 years in prison. After his arrest, Goad&#x27;s ex-wife Debbie filed a motion to withdraw her restraining order, stating that Goad &quot;has seeked counseling for three months and we are now friends after our legal divorce…. If I have a relapse from my ovarian cancer, [Jim] will take care of me and help me out.&quot;

Goad pleaded guilty to reduced charges and served years, split between jail and prison. He was released in the fall of 2000. When asked if he had any remorse or guilt about beating Ryan, Goad said, &quot;Absolutely not. I enjoyed it.&quot;

While Goad was in prison, author Jim Hogshire started a &quot;Free Jim Goad&quot; website, claiming that Goad told him he was innocent. After his release, Goad disputed the concept of the website, calling Hogshire a &quot;nutty Muslim junkie.&quot; He stated that while he had said Ryan was lying, he never claimed innocence, but was not able to speak freely while incarcerated.

===2000s===

Upon his release from prison in 2000, Goad returned to Portland and was on parole for a time. He wrote for &quot;Exotic&quot;, a free guide to the sex industry of the Northwestern United States and worked as a country music DJ. In 2008 Goad became a father. He currently maintains his website, JimGoad.net, and writes for &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

According to Goad, he was diagnosed with a &quot;plum-sized&quot; brain tumor in 2008. The situation was outlined in his book &quot;The Bomb Inside My Brain.&quot; During a nine-hour operation, the tumor was removed. He was subsequently prescribed radiation and anticonvulsive medication.

==Career==

===Writing style and beliefs===

As a writer, Jim Goad has been called the &quot;poster boy for the transgressive school of writing.&quot; Chuck Palahniuk describes Goad&#x27;s writing style as being &quot;brutally honest without worrying about being correct.&quot;

Goad&#x27;s work examines American culture, often popular and political culture. His early work reads anti-politically correct and as shock value, while his later work, like the &quot;Redneck Manifesto,&quot; and journalism contributions have marked Goad as a political and societal commentator. In his political commentary he has described conservatives and liberals in the United States as &quot;two asscheeks surrounding the same hairy bunghole,&quot; and that politicians know how to take advantage of lower- and middle-class people because of a human&#x27;s innate tribalism. He has stated his support for Donald Trump.

====&quot;ANSWER Me!&quot;====
From 1991 to 1994, Goad self-published four yearly issues of the zine &quot;ANSWER Me!&quot;, with then-wife Debbie Goad. It featured illustrations by Nick Bougas. With a circulation of 13,000 the magazine sought to upset politically correct thinkers by covering subjects about race and feminism. The publication was banned and seized by customs officials in several countries, and the final &quot;Rape Issue&quot; was rejected by some bookstore owners. The zine, called &quot;massively influential&quot; by &quot;Bizarre&quot;, would also be credited as an inspiration by Francisco Martin Duran, who took 29 shots at the White House, influencing the suicides of three British Neo-Nazis, and a possible influence on Kurt Cobain&#x27;s suicide.

====&quot;The Redneck Manifesto&quot;====
In 1994, Goad signed a two-book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster for $100,000. &quot;The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies, Hicks, and White Trash Became America&#x27;s Scapegoats&quot; was published in 1997. The book explores the idea of poor whites celebrating their heritage similar to poor African Americans, and that discrimination in the United States is focused around social class, not race. His thesis is that the rich elite blind the poor, and cause them to fight one another, instead of working together for their mutual benefit.

====&quot;Shit Magnet&quot;====

&quot;Shit Magnet: One Man&#x27;s Miraculous Ability to Absorb the World&#x27;s Guilt&quot;, is Goad&#x27;s second book. Major New York publishing houses declined to publish &quot;Shit Magnet&quot;, and it was published in 2002 by Feral House. The book, written while Goad was in prison, is an autobiography. It examines Goad&#x27;s childhood, teenage years, his relationships with former wife Debbie Goad and ex-girlfriend Anne Ryan, and reflections about his time in prison and his experience with the judicial system. The book includes great detail about Oregon prison life, including detailed descriptions about fellow prisoners, of whom he writes &quot;forced sterilization maybe wasn&#x27;t such a bad idea.&quot; Writer John Strausbaugh described &quot;Shit Magnet&quot; as &quot;extremely painful&quot; in detail and comparative in drama to the autobiography of Klaus Kinski. &quot;Humor is Dead&quot; calls &quot;Shit Magnet&quot; a &quot;sordid and often shocking personal allegory of guilt and violence.&quot; In 2008, a play titled &quot;Torn Between Two Bitches,&quot; was produced in Los Angeles by Michael Sargent, based on &quot;Shit Magnet&quot;.

====Other work====
He wrote a comic called &quot;Trucker Fags in Denial&quot;, which was originally published as a comic strip in the Portland-based publication &quot;Exotic&quot; and was published as a comic book by Fantagraphics in 2004. The comic, written by Goad and illustrated by Jim Blanchard, is about two truckers named Butch and Petey. The two characters are homophobic and beat up gays between trucking. The characters contradict their behavior by having a homosexual relationship with each other. Goad came up with the idea for the comic while in prison, where he frequently observed male prisoners insulting each other as being &quot;fags,&quot; and as &quot;fagging off,&#x27; despite engaging in homosexual acts themselves while incarcerated. &quot;Willamette Week&quot;″s gay columnist Byron Beck described &quot;Trucker Fags in Denial&quot; as &quot;twisted, vile, unrepentant ... and absolutely hilarious.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;Jim Goad&#x27;s Gigantic Book of Sex&quot; was published. The book consists of over 100 articles, op-eds and facts about sex, all written by Goad.

Goad writes a weekly column for &quot;Taki&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and Greg Johnson. Goad has also contributed to &quot;Vice&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot;.

==Acting and music==

Jim Goad has released music and performed as Big Red Goad, performing covers of classic and trucker-themed country songs. In 2007 he toured as the opening act for Hank III.

In 2002, Goad acted in &quot;The Suzy Evans Story&quot;, a film about a police detective who protects a battered woman named Suzy and proceeds to abuse her himself. Goad joked that it was typecasting. The film was never released.

==Political views==
Goad is referred to as the &quot;godfather of the new right&quot; and is associated with the alt-right movement, with Proud Boys figure Gavin McInnes citing him as one of his favorite writers. Goad does not consider himself part of the alt-right movement.
