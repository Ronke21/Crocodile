<text>In physics, Liouville&#x27;s theorem, named after the French mathematician Joseph Liouville, is a key theorem in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics. It asserts that &quot;the phase-space distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system&quot;—that is that the density of system points in the vicinity of a given system point traveling through phase-space is constant with time. This time-independent density is in statistical mechanics known as the classical a priori probability.

Liouville&#x27;s theorem applies to conservative systems, that is, systems in which the effects of friction are absent or can be ignored. The general mathematical formulation for such systems is the measure-preserving dynamical system. Liouville&#x27;s theorem applies when there are degrees of freedom that can be interpreted as positions and momenta; not all measure-preserving dynamical systems have these, but Hamiltonian systems do. The general setting for conjugate position and momentum coordinates is available in the mathematical setting of symplectic geometry. Liouville&#x27;s theorem ignores the possibility of chemical reactions, where the total number of particles may change over time, or where energy may be transferred to internal degrees of freedom. The non-squeezing theorem, which applies to all symplectic maps (the Hamiltonian is a symplectic map) implies further restrictions on phase-space flows beyond volume/density/measure conservation. There are extensions of Liouville&#x27;s theorem to cover these various generalized settings, including stochastic systems.

==Liouville equation==

The Liouville equation describes the time evolution of the &quot;phase space distribution function&quot;. Although the equation is usually referred to as the &quot;Liouville equation&quot;, Josiah Willard Gibbs was the first to recognize the importance of this equation as the fundamental equation of statistical mechanics. It is referred to as the Liouville equation because its derivation for non-canonical systems utilises an identity first derived by Liouville in 1838.

Consider a Hamiltonian dynamical system with canonical coordinates formula_1 and conjugate momenta formula_2, where formula_3. Then the phase space distribution formula_4 determines the probability formula_5 that the system will be found in the infinitesimal phase space volume formula_6 at time formula_7. The Liouville equation is

:formula_8

Time derivatives are denoted by dots, and are evaluated according to Hamilton&#x27;s equations for the system. This equation demonstrates the conservation of density in phase space (which was Gibbs&#x27;s name for the theorem). Liouville&#x27;s theorem states that:

:&quot;The distribution function is constant along any trajectory in phase space.&quot;

A uses the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional divergence theorem. The proof is based on the fact that the evolution of formula_9 obeys an &quot;2n&quot;-dimensional version of the continuity equation:

:formula_10

with formula_11 being the &quot;velocity&quot; vector of formula_2 and formula_1. The above equation means that change of the total probability within a small volume in phase space is equal to the net flux of probability density into or out of the volume. After inserting formula_14 in the above equation, we reach

:formula_15

That is, the 3-tuple formula_16 is a conserved current. The above equation can be reduced to the Liouville equation based on the following identity 

:formula_17

where formula_18 is the Hamiltonian, and we have used the relationships formula_19 and formula_20. The derivation of the Liouville equation can be viewed as the motion through phase space as a &#x27;fluid flow&#x27; of system points. The theorem that the convective derivative of the density, formula_21, is zero follows from the equation of continuity by noting that the &#x27;velocity field&#x27; formula_22 in phase space has zero divergence (which follows from Hamilton&#x27;s relations).

==Other formulations==

=== Poisson bracket ===
The theorem above is often restated in terms of the Poisson bracket as
:formula_23
or, in terms of the linear Liouville operator or Liouvillian,
:formula_24
as
:formula_25

=== Ergodic theory ===
In ergodic theory and dynamical systems, motivated by the physical considerations given so far, there is a corresponding result also referred to as Liouville&#x27;s theorem. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase space is a smooth manifold that comes naturally equipped with a smooth measure (locally, this measure is the 6&quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure). The theorem says this smooth measure is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow. More generally, one can describe the necessary and sufficient condition under which a smooth measure is invariant under a flow. The Hamiltonian case then becomes a corollary.

=== Symplectic geometry ===

We can also formulate Liouville&#x27;s Theorem in terms of symplectic geometry. For a given system, we can consider the phase space formula_26 of a particular Hamiltonian formula_18 as a manifold formula_28 endowed with a symplectic 2-form

:formula_29
The volume form of our manifold is the top exterior power of the symplectic 2-form, and is just another representation of the measure on the phase space described above.

On our phase space symplectic manifold we can define a Hamiltonian vector field generated by a function formula_30 as

:formula_31
Specifically, when the generating function is the Hamiltonian itself, formula_32, we get

:formula_33

where we utilized Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion and the definition of the chain rule.

In this formalism, Liouville&#x27;s Theorem states that the Lie derivative of the volume form is zero along the flow generated by formula_34. That is, for formula_28 a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold,

:formula_36

In fact, the symplectic structure formula_37 itself is preserved, not only its top exterior power. That is, Liouville&#x27;s Theorem also gives 

:formula_38

===Quantum Liouville equation===

The analog of Liouville equation in quantum mechanics describes the time evolution of a mixed state. Canonical quantization yields a quantum-mechanical version of this theorem, the von Neumann equation. This procedure, often used to devise quantum analogues of classical systems, involves describing a classical system using Hamiltonian mechanics. Classical variables are then re-interpreted as quantum operators, while Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators. In this case, the resulting equation is
:formula_39
where ρ is the density matrix.

When applied to the expectation value of an observable, the corresponding equation is given by Ehrenfest&#x27;s theorem, and takes the form

:formula_40

where formula_41 is an observable. Note the sign difference, which follows from the assumption that the operator is stationary and the state is time-dependent.

In the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, substituting the Moyal brackets for Poisson brackets in the phase-space analog of the von Neumann equation results in compressibility of the probability fluid, and thus violations of Liouville&#x27;s theorem incompressibility. This, then, leads to concomitant difficulties in defining meaningful quantum trajectories.

== Examples ==
=== Simple harmonic oscillator phase-space volume ===

Consider an formula_42-particle system in three dimensions, and focus on only the evolution of formula_43 particles. Within phase space, these formula_43 particles occupy an infinitesimal volume given by

: formula_45

We want formula_46 to remain the same throughout time, so that formula_47 is constant along the trajectories of the system. If we allow our particles to evolve by an infinitesimal time step formula_48, we see that each particle phase space location changes as

: formula_49

where formula_50 and formula_51 denote formula_52 and formula_53 respectively, and we have only kept terms linear in formula_48. Extending this to our infinitesimal hypercube formula_55, the side lengths change as

: formula_56

To find the new infinitesimal phase-space volume formula_57, we need the product of the above quantities. To first order in formula_48, we get the following:

: formula_59

So far, we have yet to make any specifications about our system. Let us now specialize to the case of formula_42 formula_61-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillators. That is, each particle in our ensemble can be treated as a simple harmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by

: formula_62

By using Hamilton&#x27;s equations with the above Hamiltonian we find that the term in parentheses above is identically zero, thus yielding

: formula_63

From this we can find the infinitesimal volume of phase space:

: formula_64

Thus we have ultimately found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is unchanged, yielding

: formula_65

demonstrating that Liouville&#x27;s theorem holds for this system.

The question remains of how the phase-space volume actually evolves in time. Above we have shown that the total volume is conserved, but said nothing about what it looks like. For a single particle we can see that its trajectory in phase space is given by the ellipse of constant formula_18. Explicitly, one can solve Hamilton&#x27;s equations for the system and find

:formula_67

where formula_68 and formula_69 denote the initial position and momentum of the formula_70-th particle.
For a system of multiple particles, each one will have a phase-space trajectory that traces out an ellipse corresponding to the particle&#x27;s energy. The frequency at which the ellipse is traced is given by the formula_37 in the Hamiltonian, independent of any differences in energy. As a result, a region of phase space will simply rotate about the point formula_72 with frequency dependent on formula_37. This can be seen in the animation above.

=== Damped harmonic oscillator ===

To see an example where Liouville&#x27;s theorem does &quot;not&quot; apply, we can modify the equations of motion for the simple harmonic oscillator to account for the effects of friction or damping. Consider again the system of formula_42 particles each in a formula_61-dimensional isotropic harmonic potential, the Hamiltonian for which is given in the previous example. This time, we add the condition that each particle experiences a frictional force formula_76, where formula_77 is a positive constant dictating the amount of friction. As this is a non-conservative force, we need to extend Hamilton&#x27;s equations as

:formula_78

Unlike the equations of motion for the simple harmonic oscillator, these modified equations do not take the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations, and therefore we do not expect Liouville&#x27;s theorem to hold. Instead, as depicted in the animation in this section, a generic phase space volume will shrink as it evolves under these equations of motion.

To see this violation of Liouville&#x27;s theorem explicitly, we can follow a very similar procedure to the undamped harmonic oscillator case, and we arrive again at

:formula_59

Plugging in our modified Hamilton&#x27;s equations, we find

:formula_80

Calculating our new infinitesimal phase space volume, and keeping only first order in formula_48 we find the following result:

:formula_82

We have found that the infinitesimal phase-space volume is no longer constant, and thus the phase-space density is not conserved. As can be seen from the equation as time increases, we expect our phase-space volume to decrease to zero as friction affects the system.

As for how the phase-space volume evolves in time, we will still have the constant rotation as in the undamped case. However, the damping will introduce a steady decrease in the radii of each ellipse. Again we can solve for the trajectories explicitly using Hamilton&#x27;s equations, taking care to use the modified ones above. Letting formula_83 for convenience, we find

:formula_84

where the values formula_68 and formula_69 denote the initial position and momentum of the formula_70-th particle.
As the system evolves the total phase-space volume will spiral in to the origin. This can be seen in the figure above.

==Remarks==
* The Liouville equation is valid for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. It is a fundamental equation of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
* The Liouville equation is integral to the proof of the fluctuation theorem from which the second law of thermodynamics can be derived. It is also the key component of the derivation of Green–Kubo relations for linear transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, thermal conductivity or electrical conductivity.
* Virtually any textbook on Hamiltonian mechanics, advanced statistical mechanics, or symplectic geometry will derive the Liouville theorem.
* In plasma physics, the Vlasov equation can be interpreted as Liouville&#x27;s theorem, which reduces the task of solving the Vlasov equation to that of single particle motion. By using Liouville&#x27;s theorem in this way with energy or magnetic moment conservation, for example, one can determine unknown fields using known particle distribution functions, or vice versa. This method is known as Liouville mapping.

<text>Arthur Helton (January 24, 1949 – August 19, 2003) was a lawyer, refugee advocate, teacher and author. He died in the 2003 Canal Hotel bombing while he was in Baghdad to assess humanitarian conditions in Iraq.

Helton graduated from Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City in 1971 and from New York University School of Law in 1976.

Helton joined the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York City in 1982, and in his first year convinced a federal judge to release over 2000 Haitian refugees by promising to find lawyers to represent the asylum seekers.

In 1994, Helton founded and then directed the Forced Migration Project at the Open Society Institute.

From 1999, Helton served as program director of peace and conflict studies and senior fellow for refugee studies and preventive action at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.

Helton&#x27;s last book was &quot;The Price of Indifference - Refugees and Humanitarian Action in the New Century&quot;. The work was praised by Kofi Annan, who proclaimed it &quot;...a welcome contribution to the debate on humanitarian action&quot; It won praise from Kofi Annan as &quot;highly original&quot; and &quot;ambitious&quot;. Kenneth Bacon, the president of Refugees International, called it &quot;required reading&quot;. Human Right Watch lauded his &quot;hard-nosed and persuasive advocacy&quot;. Helton was not just an analyst; he took action. The head of the Lawyers Committee, Michael Posner, said &quot;...Arthur was legendarily hard working and tenacious...Refugees around the world have lost ...one of their leading lights.&quot;

Awards and fellowships have been created in his memory, including the Arthur Helton Global Human Rights Fellowship at NYU Law, the Arthur C. Helton Human Rights Award given by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the American Society of International Law&#x27;s Arthur C. Helton Fellowship Program.

<doc id="312304" wikidata="Q1049064" url="?curid=312304" title="Symplectomorphism">
<text>In mathematics, a symplectomorphism or symplectic map is an isomorphism in the category of symplectic manifolds. In classical mechanics, a symplectomorphism represents a transformation of phase space that is volume-preserving and preserves the symplectic structure of phase space, and is called a canonical transformation.

==Formal definition==

A diffeomorphism between two symplectic manifolds formula_1 is called a symplectomorphism if
:formula_2
where formula_3 is the pullback of formula_4. The symplectic diffeomorphisms from formula_5 to formula_5 are a (pseudo-)group, called the symplectomorphism group (see below).

The infinitesimal version of symplectomorphisms gives the symplectic vector fields. A vector field formula_7 is called symplectic if
:formula_8
Also, formula_9 is symplectic if the flow formula_10 of formula_9 is a symplectomorphism for every formula_12.
These vector fields build a Lie subalgebra of formula_13.
Here, formula_13 is the set of smooth vector fields on formula_5, and formula_16 is the Lie derivative along the vector field formula_17

Examples of symplectomorphisms include the canonical transformations of classical mechanics and theoretical physics, the flow associated to any Hamiltonian function, the map on cotangent bundles induced by any diffeomorphism of manifolds, and the coadjoint action of an element of a Lie group on a coadjoint orbit.

==Flows== 
Any smooth function on a symplectic manifold gives rise, by definition, to a Hamiltonian vector field and the set of all such vector fields form a subalgebra of the Lie algebra of symplectic vector fields. The integration of the flow of a symplectic vector field is a symplectomorphism. Since symplectomorphisms preserve the symplectic 2-form and hence the symplectic volume form, Liouville&#x27;s theorem in Hamiltonian mechanics follows. Symplectomorphisms that arise from Hamiltonian vector fields are known as Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms.

Since the flow of a Hamiltonian vector field also preserves . In physics this is interpreted as the law of conservation of energy.

If the first Betti number of a connected symplectic manifold is zero, symplectic and Hamiltonian vector fields coincide, so the notions of Hamiltonian isotopy and symplectic isotopy of symplectomorphisms coincide.

It can be shown that the equations for a geodesic may be formulated as a Hamiltonian flow, see Geodesics as Hamiltonian flows.

== The group of (Hamiltonian) symplectomorphisms ==
The symplectomorphisms from a manifold back onto itself form an infinite-dimensional pseudogroup. The corresponding Lie algebra consists of symplectic vector fields.
The Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms form a subgroup, whose Lie algebra is given by the Hamiltonian vector fields. 
The latter is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of smooth
functions on the manifold with respect to the Poisson bracket, modulo the constants.

The group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of formula_18 usually denoted as formula_19.

Groups of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms are simple, by a theorem of Banyaga. They have natural geometry given by the Hofer norm. The homotopy type of the symplectomorphism group for certain simple symplectic four-manifolds, such as the product of spheres, can be computed using Gromov&#x27;s theory of pseudoholomorphic curves.

==Comparison with Riemannian geometry==
Unlike Riemannian manifolds, symplectic manifolds are not very rigid: Darboux&#x27;s theorem shows that all symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally isomorphic. In contrast, isometries in Riemannian geometry must preserve the Riemann curvature tensor, which is thus a local invariant of the Riemannian manifold. 
Moreover, every function &quot;H&quot; on a symplectic manifold defines a Hamiltonian vector field &quot;X&quot;&quot;H&quot;, which exponentiates to a one-parameter group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. It follows that the group of symplectomorphisms is always very large, and in particular, infinite-dimensional. On the other hand, the group of isometries of a Riemannian manifold is always a (finite-dimensional) Lie group. Moreover, Riemannian manifolds with large symmetry groups are very special, and a generic Riemannian manifold has no nontrivial symmetries.

==Quantizations==
Representations of finite-dimensional subgroups of the group of symplectomorphisms (after ħ-deformations, in general) on Hilbert spaces are called &quot;quantizations&quot;. 
When the Lie group is the one defined by a Hamiltonian, it is called a &quot;quantization by energy&quot;. 
The corresponding operator from the Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of continuous linear operators is also sometimes called the &quot;quantization&quot;; this is a more common way of looking at it in physics.

==Arnold conjecture==

A celebrated conjecture of Vladimir Arnold relates the &quot;minimum&quot; number of fixed points for a Hamiltonian symplectomorphism formula_20, in case formula_5 is a compact symplectic manifold, to Morse theory (see ). More precisely, the conjecture states that formula_22 has at least as many fixed points as the number of critical points that a smooth function on formula_5 must have. Certain weaker version of this conjecture has been proved: when formula_22 is &quot;nondegenerate&quot;, the number of fixed points is bounded from below by the sum of Betti numbers of formula_5 (see,). The most important development in symplectic geometry triggered by this famous conjecture is the birth of Floer homology (see ), named after Andreas Floer.

<doc id="312308" wikidata="Q1227393" url="?curid=312308" title="Dirac sea">
<text>The Dirac sea is a theoretical model of the electron vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons with negative energy, now called &quot;positrons&quot;. It was first postulated by the British physicist Paul Dirac in 1930 to explain the anomalous negative-energy quantum states predicted by the relativistically-correct Dirac equation for electrons. The positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron, was originally conceived of as a hole in the Dirac sea, before its experimental discovery in 1932.

In hole theory, the solutions with negative time evolution factors are reinterpreted as representing the positron, discovered by Carl Anderson. The interpretation of this result requires a Dirac sea, showing that the Dirac equation is not merely a combination of special relativity and quantum mechanics, but it also implies that the number of particles cannot be conserved.

Dirac sea theory has been displaced by quantum field theory, though they are mathematically compatible.

== Origins ==
Similar ideas on holes in crystals had been developed by Soviet physicist Yakov Frenkel in 1926, but there is no indication the concept was discussed with Dirac when the two met in a Soviet physics congress in the summer of 1928.

The origins of the Dirac sea lie in the energy spectrum of the Dirac equation, an extension of the Schrödinger equation consistent with special relativity, an equation that Dirac had formulated in 1928. Although this equation was extremely successful in describing electron dynamics, it possesses a rather peculiar feature: for each quantum state possessing a positive energy , there is a corresponding state with energy -. This is not a big difficulty when an isolated electron is considered, because its energy is conserved and negative-energy electrons may be left out. However, difficulties arise when effects of the electromagnetic field are considered, because a positive-energy electron would be able to shed energy by continuously emitting photons, a process that could continue without limit as the electron descends into ever lower energy states. However, real electrons clearly do not behave in this way.

Dirac&#x27;s solution to this was to rely on the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons are fermions, and obey the exclusion principle, which means that no two electrons can share a single energy state within an atom. Dirac hypothesized that what we think of as the &quot;vacuum&quot; is actually the state in which &quot;all&quot; the negative-energy states are filled, and none of the positive-energy states. Therefore, if we want to introduce a single electron, we would have to put it in a positive-energy state, as all the negative-energy states are occupied. Furthermore, even if the electron loses energy by emitting photons it would be forbidden from dropping below zero energy.

Dirac further pointed out that a situation might exist in which all the negative-energy states are occupied except one. This &quot;hole&quot; in the sea of negative-energy electrons would respond to electric fields as though it were a positively charged particle. Initially, Dirac identified this hole as a proton. However, Robert Oppenheimer pointed out that an electron and its hole would be able to annihilate each other, releasing energy on the order of the electron&#x27;s rest energy in the form of energetic photons; if holes were protons, stable atoms would not exist. Hermann Weyl also noted that a hole should act as though it has the same mass as an electron, whereas the proton is about two thousand times heavier. The issue was finally resolved in 1932, when the positron was discovered by Carl Anderson, with all the physical properties predicted for the Dirac hole.

== Inelegance of Dirac sea ==
Despite its success, the idea of the Dirac sea tends not to strike people as very elegant. The existence of the sea implies an infinite negative electric charge filling all of space. In order to make any sense out of this, one must assume that the &quot;bare vacuum&quot; must have an infinite positive charge density which is exactly cancelled by the Dirac sea. Since the absolute energy density is unobservable—the cosmological constant aside—the infinite energy density of the vacuum does not represent a problem. Only changes in the energy density are observable. Geoffrey Landis also notes that Pauli exclusion does not definitively mean that a filled Dirac sea cannot accept more electrons, since, as Hilbert elucidated, a sea of infinite extent can accept new particles even if it is filled. This happens when we have a chiral anomaly and a gauge instanton.

The development of quantum field theory (QFT) in the 1930s made it possible to reformulate the Dirac equation in a way that treats the positron as a &quot;real&quot; particle rather than the absence of a particle, and makes the vacuum the state in which no particles exist instead of an infinite sea of particles. This picture recaptures all the valid predictions of the Dirac sea, such as electron-positron annihilation. On the other hand, the field formulation does not eliminate all the difficulties raised by the Dirac sea; in particular the problem of the vacuum possessing infinite energy.

== Mathematical expression ==
Upon solving the free Dirac equation,

formula_1

one finds

formula_2

where

formula_3

for plane wave solutions with -momentum . This is a direct consequence of the relativistic energy-momentum relation

formula_4

upon which the Dirac equation is built. The quantity is a constant column vector and is a normalization constant. The quantity is called the &quot;time evolution factor&quot;, and its interpretation in similar roles in, for example, the plane wave solutions of the Schrödinger equation, is the energy of the wave (particle). This interpretation is not immediately available here since it may acquire negative values. A similar situation prevails for the Klein–Gordon equation. In that case, the &quot;absolute value&quot; of can be interpreted as the energy of the wave since in the canonical formalism, waves with negative actually have &quot;positive&quot; energy . But this is not the case with the Dirac equation. The energy in the canonical formalism associated with negative is .

== Modern interpretation ==
The Dirac sea interpretation and the modern QFT interpretation are related by what may be thought of as a very simple Bogoliubov transformation, an identification between the creation and annihilation operators of two different free field theories. In the modern interpretation, the field operator for a Dirac spinor is a sum of creation operators and annihilation operators, in a schematic notation:

formula_5

An operator with negative frequency lowers the energy of any state by an amount proportional to the frequency, while operators with positive frequency raise the energy of any state.

In the modern interpretation, the positive frequency operators add a positive energy particle, adding to the energy, while the negative frequency operators annihilate a positive energy particle, and lower the energy. For a fermionic field, the creation operator formula_6 gives zero when the state with momentum k is already filled, while the annihilation operator formula_7 gives zero when the state with momentum &quot;k&quot; is empty.

But then it is possible to reinterpret the annihilation operator as a &quot;creation&quot; operator for a negative energy particle. It still lowers the energy of the vacuum, but in this point of view it does so by creating a negative energy object. This reinterpretation only affects the philosophy. To reproduce the rules for when annihilation in the vacuum gives zero, the notion of &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;filled&quot; must be reversed for the negative energy states. Instead of being states with no antiparticle, these are states that are already filled with a negative energy particle.

The price is that there is a nonuniformity in certain expressions, because replacing annihilation with creation adds a constant to the negative energy particle number. The number operator for a Fermi field is:

formula_8

which means that if one replaces N by 1−&quot;N&quot; for negative energy states, there is a constant shift in quantities like the energy and the charge density, quantities that count the total number of particles. The infinite constant gives the Dirac sea an infinite energy and charge density. The vacuum charge density should be zero, since the vacuum is Lorentz invariant, but this is artificial to arrange in Dirac&#x27;s picture. The way it is done is by passing to the modern interpretation.

Dirac&#x27;s idea is more directly applicable to solid state physics, where the valence band in a solid can be regarded as a &quot;sea&quot; of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of semiconductors, though they are never referred to as &quot;positrons&quot;. Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge—the charge of the ionic lattice—that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.

== Revival in the theory of causal fermion systems ==
Dirac&#x27;s original concept of a sea of particles was revived in the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent proposal for a unified physical theory. In this approach, the problems of the infinite vacuum energy and infinite charge density of the Dirac sea disappear because these divergences drop out of the physical equations formulated via the causal action principle. These equations do not require a preexisting space-time, making it possible to realize the concept that space-time and all structures therein arise as a result of the collective interaction of the sea states with each other and with the additional particles and &quot;holes&quot; in the sea.

<doc id="312310" wikidata="Q196852" url="?curid=312310" title="Hue and cry">
<text>In common law, a hue and cry is a process by which bystanders are summoned to assist in the apprehension of a criminal who has been witnessed in the act of committing a crime.

==History==
By the Statute of Winchester of 1285, 13 Edw. 1. St. 2. c. 4, it was provided that anyone, either a constable or a private citizen, who witnessed a crime shall make hue and cry, and that the hue and cry must be kept up against the fleeing criminal from town to town and from county to county, until the felon is apprehended and delivered to the sheriff. All able-bodied men, upon hearing the shouts, were obliged to assist in the pursuit of the criminal, which makes it comparable to the &quot;posse comitatus&quot;. It was moreover provided that &quot;the whole hundred ... shall be answerable&quot; for the theft or robbery committed, in effect a form of collective punishment. Those who raised a hue and cry falsely were themselves guilty of a crime.

The hue and cry was utilized in medieval European towns and villages as a means of community policing.

The oath of office for constables in the United States state of Tennessee specifically mentions that it is the duty of the constable to sound the hue and cry.

==Etymology==
It is possible that the term is an Anglicization via Anglo-French of the Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;a horn and shouting&quot;. Other sources indicate that it has always been a somewhat redundant phrase meaning an outcry and cry, though such &quot;redundancy&quot; is a feature of the legal doublet. &quot;Hue&quot; appears to come from the Old French &#x27;, which means &quot;to shout&quot;, and &quot;cry&quot; from Old French &quot;&quot; (&quot;to cry&quot;).

==Cultural references==
* From the late 18th century until 1839, &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; was a principal or variant title for the weekly newspaper, containing details of crimes and wanted people, that afterwards became better known as the &quot;Police Gazette&quot;.

<text>Lara Croft is a character and the main protagonist of the video game franchise &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. She is presented as a highly intelligent and athletic British archaeologist who ventures into ancient tombs and hazardous ruins around the world. Created by a team at British developer Core Design that included Toby Gard, the character first appeared in the video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; in 1996.

Core Design handled the initial development of the character and the series. Inspired by strong female icons, Gard designed Lara Croft to counter stereotypical female characters. The company modified the character for subsequent titles, which included graphical improvements and gameplay additions. American developer Crystal Dynamics took over the series after the 2003 sequel &quot;Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness&quot; was received poorly. The new developer rebooted the character along with the video game series by altering her physical proportions and giving her additional ways of interacting with game environments.

Lara Croft has further appeared in video game spin-offs, printed adaptations, a series of animated short films, feature films, and merchandise related to the series. The promotion of the character includes a brand of apparel and accessories, action figures, and model portrayals. She has been licensed for third-party promotion, including television and print advertisements, music-related appearances, and as a spokesmodel.

Critics consider Lara Croft a significant video game character in popular culture. She holds six &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, has a strong fan following, and is among the first video game characters to be successfully adapted to film. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, one of the earliest in the industry to achieve widespread attention. The character&#x27;s influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics; viewpoints range from a positive agent of change in video games to a negative role model for young girls.

== Characteristics ==
Lara Croft is depicted as an athletic female with brown eyes and dark auburn hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character&#x27;s classic costume is a turquoise leotard, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shorts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.

Lara&#x27;s backstory has changed dramatically over the course of the series. During the first era, beginning in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (1996), game manuals describe the character as the Wimbledon, London-born daughter of Lord Henshingly Croft (Lord Richard Croft in &quot;Legend&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; timelines). She was raised as a British aristocrat and betrothed to the fictitious Earl of Faringdon. Lara attended the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school. At the age of twenty-one, she survived a plane crash, which left her stranded in the Himalayas for two weeks; the experience spurred her to shun her former life and seek other adventures around the world. Croft published books and other written works based on her exploits as a mercenary, big-game hunter, and master thief. These provided her with a replacement source of income after her father disowned her over her change in lifestyle.

During the second era, which began with &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot; (2006), Lara&#x27;s story was changed to be the daughter of archaeologist Lord Richard Croft, the Earl of Abingdon, and someone who was quickly identified as a highly talented individual while attending the Abingdon Girls School. The plane crash was changed to when Lara was nine years old, and with her mother, Amelia Croft. While searching for shelter, Lara and her mother took refuge in an ancient Nepalese temple, where Lara witnesses her mother vanish after tampering with an ancient sword. Her father later disappears in search of his wife. This spurs Lara on to seek the reason for her mother&#x27;s disappearance.

The third era, established in &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2013), deviates from the original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was on one of these expeditions that her mother, Amelia Croft, vanished and was presumed dead and when her father Richard presumably took his own life a few years later, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she inherited a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam&#x27;s free spirit and a wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon&#x27;s Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilization of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from an untested young woman to a survivor. After experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.

== Character development history ==

Core Design, a subsidiary of Eidos, created Lara Croft as the lead protagonist of its video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, which began development in 1994. Lead graphic artist Toby Gard went through about five designs before arriving at the character&#x27;s final appearance. He initially envisioned a male lead character with a whip and a hat. Core Design co-founder Jeremy Smith characterised Gard&#x27;s initial design as derivative of Indiana Jones and asked for more originality. Gard decided that a female character would work better from a design standpoint. He also cited &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; as an influence; Gard noticed that while watching people play the game, players selected one of the two available female characters in the game almost every match he saw. Gard expressed a desire to counter stereotypical female characters, which he has characterised as &quot;bimbos&quot; or &quot;dominatrix&quot; types. Smith was sceptical of a female lead at first because few contemporary games featured them. He came to regard a female lead as a great hook and put faith in Gard&#x27;s idea. Inspired by pop artist Neneh Cherry and comic book character Tank Girl, Gard experimented with different designs, including &quot;sociopathic blonds, muscle women, flat topped hip-hopsters and a Nazi-like militant in a baseball cap&quot;. He settled on a tough South American latina woman with a braid named Laura Cruz. 

Tomb Raider co-creator Paul Douglas changed her given name after consulting a baby names book, &quot;Lara had a more interesting derivation than Laura so we chose that. Lara is from the same derivation as Larisa. Which is derived from Larissa in Greece. Which means “citadel”. I thought that would be apt for her personality—enigmatic and guarded.&quot; Her surname was changed by scriptwriter Vicky Arnold later in development, &quot;Cruz was changed to Croft quite a bit later in the project by Vicky. That came out of the Derby phonebook. Cruz was Spanish/Portuguese for Cross and it wasn’t too far from Cross to Croft. We must have stuck with the Cruz surname for a while as we got into the rut of referring to her as just Lara. In the first game design doc, dated December 1994, Laura is already changed to Lara but even in the final game design documents there are still places where Cruz hadn’t yet changed to Croft.&quot; Along with the name change, the character&#x27;s backstory was altered to incorporate a British origin.

Gard was keen to animate the character realistically, an aspect he felt the industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with the character more easily. Lara&#x27;s dual-wielding of pistols was inspired by the film &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; and an &quot;Æon Flux&quot; short. In the first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, Croft&#x27;s three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230 polygons. The character&#x27;s braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games, explained: &quot;It had been dropped from the original because it just didn&#x27;t work properly with all the acrobatic moves—it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came up with a way to get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked&quot;. Although widely reported that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts&#x27; dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change, Gard has stated that the notion &quot;came out of a silly remark made in an interview&quot;. Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).

Core Design improved and modified the character with each installment. Developers for &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; increased the number of polygons in the character&#x27;s model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot;. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot;, the developers increased the number of polygons in Croft&#x27;s 3D model to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in &quot;Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation&quot; and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character&#x27;s set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for &quot;The Last Revelation&quot; began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.

The next title, &quot;Tomb Raider Chronicles&quot;, depicted the late Lara Croft via her friends&#x27; flashbacks. The game introduced stealth attacks, which would carry over to the next game, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness&quot;. While the original development team worked on &quot;Chronicles&quot;, Core Design assigned a new team to develop &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; for the PlayStation 2. Anticipating innovative changes from next-generation consoles, Adrian Smith—co-founder of Core Design—wanted to reinvent the character to keep pace with the updated technology. Core Design conducted market research, including fan polls, to aid in &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;″ development. The development team felt it could not alter the character and instead opted to place her in a situation different from previous games. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed for more manoeuvres and a more detailed character model; the number of polygons in Croft&#x27;s model increased to 4,400. The team sought to add more melee manoeuvres to better match Lara Croft&#x27;s portrayal as an expert fighter in her backstory. Movement control was switched from the directional pad to the analogue control stick to provide more precision. After the original team finished &quot;Chronicles&quot;, it joined the development of &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;. Excess content, missed production deadlines, and Eidos&#x27; desire to time the game&#x27;s launch to coincide with the release of the 2003 &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; film resulted in what was criticized as a poorly designed game; Croft was brought back to life without explanation and the character controls lacked precision.

=== Developer switch to Crystal Dynamics ===

&quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; was received poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; development team began work on a new title (&quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;), which would essentially reboot the franchise, significantly changing her origin story, with Toby Gard returning to work as a consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos&#x27;s vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos&#x27;s. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; was abandoned and a new plot was created for &quot;Legend&quot;.

Crystal Dynamics focused on believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing decisions around the question, &quot;What could Lara do?&quot;, and giving her action more freedom. The designers updated Lara Croft&#x27;s move set to make her movements appear more fluid and continuous. The animations were also updated so the character could better interact with environmental objects. The developers introduced a feature that causes the character&#x27;s skin and clothing to appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on the ground. Responding to criticism directed at the character controls in &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot;, Crystal Dynamics redesigned the character&#x27;s control scheme to provide what it felt was the best third-person action experience. The developers also introduced close-quarter melee manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics updated the character model to add more realism, but retained past design elements. The polygon count increased to over 9,800. More attention was paid to the character&#x27;s lip synching and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in-game events. In redesigning the character&#x27;s appearance, Crystal Dynamics updated Croft&#x27;s hairstyle, wardrobe, and accessories. Her shirt was changed to a V-neck crop top, her body was given more muscle tone, and her hair braid was switched to a ponytail. The voice actor for Lara Croft was initially rumoured to be Rachel Weisz, but the role was eventually given to Keeley Hawes. Crystal Dynamics retained the design changes for the next game, &quot;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&quot;, a remake of the first game. The designers aimed to portray Croft with more emotional depth, and focused on the character&#x27;s desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. The developers used the death to evoke guilt in Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.
&quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot; continued the plot line established in &quot;Legend&quot;. Crystal Dynamics used new technology to improve the character for seventh-generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from &quot;Legend&quot; was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft&#x27;s facial model by increasing the number of polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft&#x27;s hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character&#x27;s body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.

The developers tried to redefine Lara Croft&#x27;s actions by questioning what they felt the character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, &quot;Underworld&quot; introduced motion capture-based animation to display more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting with one hand while the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems used different techniques to achieve this. In response to &quot;Underworld&quot;″s lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character&#x27;s appearance to appeal more to female fans.

=== Publisher switch to Square Enix ===

Japanese game company Square Enix acquired Eidos in April 2009, restructuring Eidos into Square Enix Europe. Crystal Dynamics remained as developer of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games. &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot; introduced cooperative gameplay to the series, a move that brand director Karl Stewart said was meant to &quot;show [Lara] as a more humanistic character&quot; by placing her in a situation that differed from previous instalments. The game uses the same technology featured in the studio&#x27;s past &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games. Despite the changes implemented in the titles, Crystal Dynamics believed that the series required further reinvention to stay relevant.

In late 2010, Square Enix announced a franchise reboot titled &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;; the new Lara Croft would be a darker, grittier reimagining of the character. In examining the character, Crystal Dynamics concluded that Croft&#x27;s largest failing was her &quot;Teflon coating&quot;, and that it needed a more human version that players would care about. The studio sought a new voice actress, trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers.
The second reboot focuses on the origin of the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character&#x27;s biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character&#x27;s appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, &quot;M-shaped&quot; lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose. The company also changed the character&#x27;s wardrobe, focusing on what it believed was more functional and practical. In designing the outfits, staff aimed to create a look that was &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;youthful&quot;, but not too &quot;trendy&quot; or &quot;hip&quot;. To gauge the redesign, Crystal Dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed the new version and previous ones. Camilla Luddington voiced Lara Croft in the reboot.

Similar to &quot;Underworld&quot;, the new &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; features motion capture-based animation. In an effort to present realism and emotion in the character, Crystal Dynamics captured face and voice performances to accompany the body performances. The company revamped Croft&#x27;s in-game combat abilities. Crystal Dynamics aimed to make the &quot;combat fresh to the franchise, competitive amongst [similar games], and relevant to the story&quot;. Among the changes is the implementation of a free aiming system. The studio reasoned that such a system would cause players to be more invested in the action by fostering a &quot;raw, brutal, and desperate&quot; style. Global brand director Karl Stewart stated that such desperation relates to the updated character&#x27;s inexperience with violence. He further commented that Lara Croft is thrust into a situation where she is forced to kill, which will be a traumatic and defining moment for her.

== Appearances ==
=== In video games ===
Lara Croft primarily appears in the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; video game series published by Square Enix Europe (previously Eidos Interactive). The action-adventure games feature the protagonist travelling the world in search of rare objects and mystical artefacts. Croft first appeared in the 1996 video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, in which she competes against a rival archaeologist in search of an Atlantean artefact. &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot; (1997) centres on the search for the Dagger of Xian, which is sought by thieves. &quot;Tomb Raider III&quot; (1998) focuses on meteorite fragments that endow humans with supernatural powers. In &quot;Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation&quot; (1999), the first depiction of a young Croft, she is accompanied by her mentor, Werner Von Croy. Lara searches for artefacts associated with the Egyptian god Horus, and later encounters Von Croy as an antagonist. In &quot;Tomb Raider: Chronicles&quot; (2000), most of the game relates adventures told via flashbacks. The first portable game, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2000), was released on the Game Boy Color, and follows the character&#x27;s search for the Nightmare Stone. A second Game Boy Color title, &quot;Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword&quot; (2001), sees Lara Croft facing off against a cult. The next portable game, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Prophecy&quot; (2002), was released on the Game Boy Advance, and focuses on three magical stones. &quot;Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness&quot; (2003) was released on home platforms, centring on the murder of Professor Von Croy.

Eidos rebooted the series with &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot; (2006), which focuses on Lara Croft&#x27;s search for Excalibur and her mother, altering the character&#x27;s backstory as part of the redesign. &quot;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&quot; (2007), a remake of the first game in the series, carried over design elements from &quot;Legend&quot;. &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot; (2008) continues the plot introduced in &quot;Legend&quot;. The story centres on Croft&#x27;s search for information about her mother&#x27;s disappearance. In the process she learns of the existence of Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjölnir. &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot; (2010) is a downloadable game that is set in a Central American jungle, and features an ancient warrior who works with Lara Croft. In 2013, the series was rebooted a second time with the game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, which retold the story of Lara&#x27;s origins and began a new continuity. Its sequel &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot; was released in 2015, and the third game, &quot;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&quot;, in 2018.

Outside of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. Lara Croft also appears as a Diana DLC crossover skin in the fighting game &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;. Additionally, Croft makes a cameo appearance in the PlayStation 5 game &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;. Lara Croft appears in &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; sixth season of the second chapter and was featured in a &quot;Team Up!&quot; mode with Aloy from &quot;Horizon Zero Dawn&quot;. Lara Croft also made an appearance in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&quot;″s Season 5 Reloaded update. Lara Croft appears as a playable character in &quot;Hero Wars: Alliance&quot; and &quot;Hero Wars: Dominion Era&quot; as part of a special time-limited event. Croft will be a playable survivor in the asymmetrical horror game &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;, scheduled for release in the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; DLC on 16 July 2024.

=== In films ===
Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights for &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; in 1998, which was released as &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; in 2001. Producer Lloyd Levin stated that the filmmakers tried to capture the essence of the video game elements rather than duplicate them. Acknowledging the character&#x27;s &quot;huge fan base&quot; and recognisable appearance, director Simon West sought an actress with acting ability as well as physical attributes similar to Croft. Paramount also received input from developer Core Design on casting. Rumoured actresses included Pamela Anderson, Demi Moore and Jeri Ryan. Academy Award-winning actress Angelina Jolie was eventually cast to play Lara Croft. She had not been a fan of the character, but considered the role as a &quot;big responsibility&quot;, citing anxiety about fans&#x27; high expectations. Producer Lawrence Gordon felt she was a perfect fit for the role. Jolie braided her hair and used minimal padding to increase her bust a cup size to 36D for the role. She felt that Croft&#x27;s video game proportions were unrealistic, and wanted to avoid showing such proportions to young girls. Jolie trained rigorously for the action scenes required for the role, occasionally sustaining injuries. Her training focused on practising the physical skills necessary to perform the film&#x27;s stunts. The difficulty of the training and injuries discouraged her, but she continued working through production. Jolie also encountered difficulties when working the guns, bungee jumping, and maneuvering with the braid. West had not anticipated that Jolie would do her own stunts, and was impressed, as was stunt coordinator Simon Crane, by the effort she put into them.

Angelina Jolie reprised her role for a sequel, &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;. Directed by Jan de Bont, the 2003 film focused more on the character&#x27;s development. De Bont praised Jolie&#x27;s understanding of Lara Croft, as well as the character&#x27;s strength, saying he &quot;hates women in distress&quot;. Producer Levin commented that the film staff tried to handle the character properly, and consulted with the video game developers on what would be appropriate. Despite the second film&#x27;s poor reception, Paramount remained open to releasing a third. Jolie was still optioned to play the character in a third film as late as 2007, though she had commented in 2004 that she had no intention of reprising the role again.

Development for a third film was announced in 2009, with Dan Lin as the producer. Lin intended to reboot the film series with a young Croft in an origin story. In 2011, Olivia Wilde denied rumours that she would play the role, but still expressed interest. The film, originally meant for a 2013 release, was to be produced by Graham King, written by Marti Noxon and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in partnership with King&#x27;s studio GK Films. Alicia Vikander was cast in 2016 to play Lara in the next film adaptation. &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, directed by Roar Uthaug, was released in 2018 and takes inspiration mostly from the rebooted series that started in 2013. A sequel was in development, but was cancelled in July 2022 after MGM lost the film rights to the franchise due to its expiration.

=== In other adaptations ===
Beginning in 1997, the character regularly appeared in comics by Top Cow Productions. Lara Croft first appeared in a crossover in Sara Pezzini&#x27;s &quot;Witchblade&quot;, and later starred in her own comic book series in 1999. The series began with Dan Jurgens as the writer, featuring artwork by Andy Park and Jon Sibal. The stories were unrelated to the video games until issue 32 of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series, which adapted &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot;″s plot. The series ran for 50 issues in addition to special issues. Other printed adaptations are &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Amulet of Power&quot;, a 2003 novel written by Mike Resnick; &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Lost Cult&quot;, a 2004 novel written by E. E. Knight; and &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Man of Bronze&quot;, a 2005 novel written by James Alan Gardner.

GameTap released &quot;&quot; in 2007 via the GameTap TV section of its website. The web series is a collection of ten short animated films that features re-imagined versions of Croft by well-known animators, comic book artists, and writers, including Jim Lee, Warren Ellis, and Peter Chung. Episodes ranged from five to seven and half minutes in length, featuring Minnie Driver as Croft. The creative staff was given considerable freedom to re-interpret the character; they did not consult the video game designers, but were given a guide listing acceptable and unacceptable practices. Hayley Atwell voices Lara in the Netflix animated series, &quot;Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&quot;.

== Promotion and merchandising ==
Eidos&#x27;s German branch and the KMF agency handled marketing for Lara Croft. According to Eidos, no focus groups or scientific studies were consulted when devising the marketing strategy for the character. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted to portray the character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft&#x27;s personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos&#x27;s product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix&#x27;s acquisition, Eidos&#x27;s marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its new version of the character.

Lara Croft has appeared on the cover of multiple video game magazines. The character has also been featured on the cover of non-video game publications such as British style magazine &quot;The Face&quot;, American news magazines &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, German magazine &quot;Focus&quot;, and the front page of British newspaper the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. Eidos licensed the character for third party advertisements, including television ads for Visa, Lucozade drinks, G4 TV, &quot;Brigitte&quot; magazine, and SEAT cars (Seat Ibiza, Seat Cordoba, Seat Alhambra and Seat Arosa). &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; staff attributes Croft&#x27;s &quot;iconic&quot; status in part to the Lucozade commercials, calling them one of the most memorable advertisements to use video game elements. Picture advertisements appeared on the sides of double-decker buses and walls of subway stations. Irish rock band U2 commissioned custom renders for video footage displayed on stage in its 1997 PopMart tour. German punk band Die Ärzte&#x27;s 1998 music video for &quot;Men are Pigs&quot; () also features Croft. Music groups have dedicated songs to the character, culminating in the release of the album &quot;A Tribute to Lara Croft&quot;. Bands and artists including Depeche Mode, Moby, Faith No More, Jimi Tenor, and Apollo 440 donated their songs for the album. In conjunction with the release of the 2001 film adaptation, Eidos licensed Lara Croft free-of-charge to the Gordonstoun boarding school for a commercial. The school approached Eidos about use of the character. Eidos allowed the one-time licence due to Core Design&#x27;s inclusion of Gordonstoun in Croft&#x27;s fictional biography without the school&#x27;s permission. Near the end of 2006, Lara Croft became the spokesmodel for the Skin Cancer Awareness Foundation of Minden, Nevada as part of its Sun Smart Teen Program. The foundation felt that the character personified the benefits of a healthy body, and that young teenagers could relate to Croft.

Lara Croft&#x27;s likeness has been a model for merchandise. The first action figures were produced by Toy Biz, based on the video game version of the character. Playmates Toys released a series of action figures that depict Croft in different outfits and accessories from the video games, later producing figures modelled after Jolie for &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. Graphic designer Marc Klinnert of Studio OXMOX released -scale model kits of the character, and later built a full-scale version. &quot;Arcade: The Videogame Magazine&quot; and &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; promoted life-size Croft statues as contest prizes. Spurred by a rumour that Eidos provided Lara Croft autographs, fans wrote to the company to obtain them. The quantity prompted Eidos to quickly produce autographed cards to meet demand. &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot; themes and wallpapers featuring the character were released for the PlayStation 3. Xbox Live Marketplace released Xbox 360 avatars in conjunction with &quot;Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light&quot;. Eidos released a brand of Lara Croft apparel and accessories, marketed under the label &quot;LARA&quot;. The line included wallets, watches, bathrobes, and Zippo lighters. Other third-party apparel are hiking boots, backpacks, leather jackets, and thermoses. Croft&#x27;s likeness has also appeared on French postage stamps, PlayStation memory cards, and trading cards as part of a collectible card game. In October 1997, Eidos held an art exhibition titled &quot;Lara Goes Art&quot; in Hamburg, Germany to promote &quot;Tomb Raider II&quot;. The exhibit featured selected artwork of the character submitted by artists and fans. Pieces included oil and airbrushed paintings, photo comics, and Klinnert&#x27;s model; SZM Studios provided the computer-generated footage it had created for Die Ärzte&#x27;s music video and the &quot;Brigitte&quot; magazine television commercial.

=== Promotional models ===
Eidos hired several models to portray Lara Croft at publicity events, promotions, trade shows, and photo shoots. Initially Eidos employed four models to dress as Lara for a photo call at a trade event, but after witnessing the unusually large crowd the models drew, they decided to expand the concept by casting a single official Lara who would role-play the character. Nathalie Cook was the first model to assume the role individually, portraying the character from 1996 to 1997. Cook was followed by British actress Rhona Mitra from 1997 to 1998. Eidos then updated the Croft costume to match its video game depiction. Core Design said they restricted Mitra&#x27;s dialogue as the character, only allowing her to answer questions in-character if Core had reviewed the questions ahead of time and scripted answers. French model Vanessa Demouy succeeded Mitra for a brief time until fashion model Nell McAndrew took over the role at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo. McAndrew portrayed Croft from 1998 until 1999, when Eidos fired her for posing in &quot;Playboy&quot;, which used the character and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; franchise to promote the McAndrew&#x27;s issue without Eidos&#x27;s approval. Core Design was granted an injunction against the magazine to protect the character&#x27;s image; &quot;Playboy&quot; was ordered to place stickers on the cover of the issue to conceal the reference to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. Eidos later donated McAndrew&#x27;s Tomb Raider costume to a UNICEF charity auction.

Lara Weller followed McAndrew from 1999 to 2000. Subsequent models were Lucy Clarkson from 2000 to 2002 and Jill de Jong, who wore a costume based on Lara Croft&#x27;s new appearance in &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot; from 2002 to 2004. Karima Adebibe became the model from 2006 to 2008, and wore a costume based on the updated version of Croft in &quot;Legend&quot;. She was the first model Eidos allowed to portray Lara Croft outside posing for photography. To prepare for the role, Adebibe trained in areas the character was expected to excel in like combat, motorcycling, elocution, and conduct. Gymnast Alison Carroll succeeded Adebibe in 2008 and featured apparel based on the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Underworld&quot;. Similar to Adebibe, Carroll received special training—Special Air Service (SAS) survival, weapons, and archaeology—to fill the role. Crystal Dynamics discontinued the use of models as part of the franchise&#x27;s second reboot. The number of models prompted &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; to award the character an official record for the &quot;most official real life stand-ins&quot; in 2008.

== Reception and legacy ==
Lara Croft&#x27;s introduction was widely regarded as an innovation in the video game market, with Rob Smith of &quot;&quot; describing her as a video game icon of that generation of games. &quot;IGN&quot; credited a rise in PlayStation sales in part to Croft&#x27;s debut on the system, and &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; attributed the first title&#x27;s success to the character. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; stated alternatively that &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;″s PlayStation success propelled the character to prominence, making her a mascot for the system. &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; credits coverage in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 1997 as the starting point of the character&#x27;s mainstream attention. Jeremy Smith commented that the &quot;Financial Times&quot; is &quot;a very serious, sober, broadsheet newspaper, and hardly the place you might expect Lara to be &#x27;discovered&#x27;. But Eidos had announced its latest financial results, which were great results, and so the &quot;Financial Times&quot; had decided to put Eidos on the front page. They&#x27;d been given some Eidos information and artwork, and they decided to use Lara to illustrate their news piece&quot;. He further said that Eidos had not actively courted Lara&#x27;s early magazine cover appearances or otherwise actively promoted the character at the time. As years progressed, Lara Croft&#x27;s popularity declined due to a string of poorly received video game sequels. &quot;The Angel of Darkness&quot; is often cited as the character&#x27;s low point. IGN editor Colin Moriarty stated that while she began as an intelligent and strong female character, her games grew bland and Lara Croft became more like a &quot;virtual blow-up doll&quot;.

Crystal Dynamics&#x27; rendition of Croft in &quot;Legend&quot; garnered wide, though not universal, praise; many publications described the portrayal as a successful reboot. &quot;Game Informer&quot; named Lara Croft the number six top video game hero of 2006, citing the character&#x27;s successful reprise in popularity. The magazine cited the character&#x27;s alterations in &quot;Legend&quot; as the reason for her resurgent success. Chris Slate of &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; lauded the character changes in &quot;Legend&quot;, commenting that &quot;Lara is finally back&quot;. He praised Eidos&#x27;s decision to switch developers and Crystal Dynamics&#x27; contributions, especially the character&#x27;s new gameplay manoeuvres and updated appearance. Others, such as Schedeen and &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Patrick Shaw, felt that the makeover did not improve the character. Fans also disapproved of the changes, especially the switch from the braid.

Dr. Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University described Lara Croft as a psychological tabula rasa. Richard Rouse of &quot;Midway Games&quot; attributed the character&#x27;s appeal to a loosely defined personality, which permits players to imprint their own onto her. Jeremy Smith stated that the minimal personality allows players to form a relationship with the character, and that rather than taking on the role of the character they were sharing the game&#x27;s experience with her. Burton added that Croft is perceived differently around the world. French demographics focus on her sex appeal, while German and British audiences are drawn to her aggressiveness and aloofness, respectively. Fansites dedicated to Lara Croft appeared on the internet in several languages after the release of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and contained official and fan-created images of Croft, model photographs, and fan fiction starring the character. More than 100 such sites were present by the end of 1998. By 2000, search engine HotBot yielded around 4,700 pages for a search of the character&#x27;s name. Admirers discussed rumours related to Lara Croft via usenet newsgroups and ICQ chats. Enthusiasts collected merchandise and paraphernalia, submitted fan art to video game magazines, participated in Croft cosplay, and obtained tattoos depicting the character. One admirer rode a bike over from Amsterdam to Derby wearing Lara Croft-brand clothing to meet the developers, who welcomed him after learning of the trip.

Lara Croft holds a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; as the &quot;most recognized female video game character&quot;, and received a star on the Walk of Game in San Francisco. Magazines, including &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, have also described her as one of the iconic and best female video game character of all time. &quot;Game Informer&quot; commented that the character is well liked around the world, particularly in England. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; described Croft as &quot;one of today&#x27;s premier videogame and movie heroes&quot;, and &quot;Play&quot; magazine described her as &quot;3D gaming&#x27;s first female superstar&quot;. Hartas called Croft one of the most famous game women, praising her independence. Karen Jones of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; described the character as &quot;one of the biggest stars on the PlayStation&quot;. In 1998, &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; commented that Lara Croft was one of the most memorable characters on the PlayStation console, and echoed a similar statement in 2004. &quot;Time&quot; magazine writer Chris Taylor called her &quot;the foundation of one of the most successful franchises in video-game history&quot;.

=== Sex symbol ===
Lara Croft has become a sex symbol for video games, despite Toby Gard&#x27;s intentions for her to be sexy &quot;only because of her power&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Kristina Dell considered her the first sex symbol of video games. Schedeen stated that Croft is among the first video game icons to be accepted as a mainstream sex symbol. Robert Ashley of &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; described Lara Croft as the first video game character openly thought of as sexy, and attributed the appearance of similar 3D characters to her. Several publications listed big breasts as one of the character&#x27;s most famous attributes. After interviewing players in 1998, Griffiths commented that players regularly mention Croft&#x27;s breasts when discussing her. In 2008, the character was first and second on two UGO Networks lists of hottest video game characters. &quot;GameDaily&quot; placed Lara Croft number one on a similar list that same year, and &quot;PlayStation: The Official Magazine&quot; awarded her honourable mention for Game Babe of the Year. Croft has appeared in several issues of &quot;Play&quot;″s Girls of Gaming special and &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot;″s Swimsuit special. Layouts portray the character partially nude, in bikinis, and in revealing cocktail dresses, though &quot;Tomb Raider: Underworld&quot;″s creative director Eric Lindstrom criticised such poses as out of character. He further stated that they conflict with Croft&#x27;s popular strengths, and felt that fans respond more strongly to images of the character dressed more conservatively than to ones with provocative poses. &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot;″s staff agreed, commenting that better use of the character&#x27;s sex appeal would please fans more.

Male players have performed in-game actions to make Lara Croft repeatedly say phrases and view closer camera angles of her bust, while pornography featuring the character has been distributed via the internet. After the first game&#x27;s release, rumours appeared on the internet about a cheat code to remove the character&#x27;s clothes. Despite Core Design&#x27;s denial of such a code, the rumour persisted, fuelled by manipulated nude images. The rumour lingered by the time &quot;Legend&quot; was released. &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; featured an April Fool&#x27;s parody of Croft and the rumoured code referred to as &quot;Nude Raider&quot;. Fans developed software patches to remove Lara Croft&#x27;s clothing in the personal computer game releases.

Reactions from groups have been mixed. The journal &quot;Leonardo&quot; noted some feminists&#x27; negative reaction to her design; though males were identifying with their feminine side through Croft, she reinforced unrealistic ideals about the female body. Australian feminist scholar Germaine Greer criticised her as an embodiment of male fantasies. In 1996, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; argued that rather than altering the state of women in games, Croft simply continued the trend of female characters in video games being large-breasted and scantily clad in an effort to appeal to the predominately male gaming audience, which had the overall impact of teaching gamers to see women as sex objects. &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; staff commented that Croft could be seen as either a role model for young independent girls or the embodiment of a male adolescent fantasy, though they later stated that the character does little to attract female demographics and was obviously designed with a male audience in mind. The magazine&#x27;s editors also criticised Core Design&#x27;s hypocritical attempts to downplay the character&#x27;s sex appeal in public statements while releasing advertisements that prominently featured Lara Croft&#x27;s sexuality. Graphic artist Heather Gibson attributed the &quot;sexism&quot; to participation from Eidos&#x27;s marketing department.

Author Mark Cohen attributed Lara Croft&#x27;s eroticism among male fans to the character&#x27;s appearance and a male protective instinct. German psychologist Oscar Holzberg described the protective behaviour as the result of the opportunity to act as a hero in virtual worlds and a fear of powerful, emancipated women. Jonathan Smith of &quot;Arcade: The Videogame Magazine&quot; similarly noted that male players often see themselves as &quot;chivalrous protectors&quot; while playing the game. Holzberg further stated that the lower psychological investment inherent to virtual characters is more comfortable for males. Cohen affirmed that despite blatant male appeal, Croft garnered a serious female audience. Eidos estimated that by 2000 female consumers comprised 20–25 percent of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; game purchases. Jeremy Smith argued that the series attracted more female players to video gaming, especially in Japan. Smith believed that Croft does not alienate prospective female players, representing an emancipated heroine and not simply an attractive character. According to Adrian Smith, the character was also popular with younger demographics that did not view her sexually. Cohen reasoned that Croft differs from other erotic characters and attractive leads, as the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games also feature rich action, impressive graphics, and intelligent puzzles; other such characters were unsuccessful because the game content was lacking. Amy Hennig of developer Naughty Dog and Griffiths echoed similar statements. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; editor Justin Towell nonetheless commented that he couldn&#x27;t imagine a &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; game without a sexualised female lead.

Griffith described Lara Croft as a flawed female influence. He stated that though the character is a step in the right direction, too many women view her as a &quot;crudely realised male fantasy figure&quot;. Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of &quot;WomenGamers.com&quot; commented that Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed to the lack of prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;, but Roby felt that though Lara Croft&#x27;s proportions have become more realistic, the character&#x27;s personality was diluted by the developer&#x27;s actions to appeal to a male audience.

=== Cultural impact ===
Lara Croft&#x27;s 1996 debut is often cited as a catalyst for more female leads in video games. Kaiser Hwang of &quot;PlayStation Magazine&quot; commented that she &quot;brought girl power&quot; to video games. IGN argued that Croft helped redefine gender in video games by providing a different interpretation of what women could do. Several publications have used her as the standard to which later female video game characters have been compared. Multiple video game publications have labelled the character a video game and cultural icon. The title character in the 1998 German film &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; has often been compared to Croft. Comparisons were also made to Bond girl Christmas Jones from the 1999 &quot;James Bond&quot; series film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;. Additionally, both Eidos Interactive senior executive John Davis and character spokeswoman Susie Hamilton noted the character&#x27;s similarities to Lara Croft. Jeremy Smith credits Croft with exposing the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games and video games in general to a wider audience. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; commented that Croft&#x27;s appearance on the cover of &quot;The Face&quot; signalled a change in the perception of video games from &quot;geeky&quot; to mainstream.

The character is honoured in the English city Derby, previous home to Core Design. In 2007, Radleigh Homes placed a blue plaque for Croft at the site of Core Design&#x27;s former offices, now a block of flats. The Derby City Council opened a public vote in 2009 to name its new ring road. The winning choice, with 89% of over 27,000 votes, was &quot;Lara Croft Way&quot;, which later opened in July 2010. In 2020, Croft appeared on four commemorative UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate classic UK video games. A 2024 poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Lara Croft as the most iconic video-game character of all time.

Yahoo! Movies and IGN credit Jolie&#x27;s role in the first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; film with significantly raising her profile and propelling her to international super-stardom, respectively. Jolie commented that young children would ask her to sign objects as Lara Croft. After filming for the first movie at the Cambodian temple Ta Prohm, the local inhabitants called it the &quot;Angelina Jolie Temple&quot; and local restaurants served Jolie&#x27;s favourite alcoholic beverage advertised as &quot;Tomb Raider cocktails&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Jesse Schedeen described Croft as one of few characters to receive a decent videogame-to-movie adaptation. By 2008, the first &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; film was the highest-grossing video game film and the largest opening ever for a movie headlined by a woman. It became the second highest-grossing video game movie in 2010, after the release of &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, with &quot;Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life&quot; as the fourth.

<text>The flag of the state of North Carolina, often referred to as the North Carolina flag, N.C. flag, or North Star, is the state flag of the U.S. state of North Carolina.

== History ==
=== First flag (1861–1885) ===

North Carolina did not have an official state flag until the North Carolinian state constitutional convention of 1861. During this convention, delegates voted to join the Confederacy. They established a committee to come up with a flag. This flag was ratified by the convention on June 22, 1861. The flag consisted of a red field with a white star in the center. Inscribed above the star was the date May 20, 1775, the controversial date of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Inscribed below the star in a semi-circular form was the date May 20, 1861, which was the date North Carolina declared it had seceded from the Union. The flag also contained two bars of equal width, one in blue and one in white. The design is similar to one suggested by Raleigh artist William G. Browne.

During the American Civil War, secessionist leaders spoke of the Mecklenburg Declaration with reverence, attempting to connect it with the state&#x27;s joining the Confederacy. Confederate leader Jefferson Davis spoke to a Charlotte crowd in September 1864, saying &quot;people of this section were the first to defy British authority and declare themselves free&quot; encouraging them to continue backing the Confederacy&#x27;s civil war effort.

===Second flag (1885–present)===
==== Flag Statute of 1885 ====

A former Confederate soldier and adjutant general of North Carolina (18771888), Johnston Jones, introduced the bill which led the state legislature to adopt a new flag in March 1885, to replace the flag that had been adopted on June 22, 1861. The red field of the old flag was replaced by a blue field. This was the first and only flag formally representing the State of North Carolina as part of the United States.

The flag of the State of North Carolina was adopted by statute of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1885. It is defined in the general Statute 144-1 as follows:

==== Flag modification of 1991 ====

On June 24, 1991, a bill was passed by the North Carolina Senate that changed the official proportions of the state flag. It changed from &quot;… the total length of the flag shall be one-third more than its width&quot; as written in the 1885 act to &quot;… the total length of the flag shall be one-half more than its width.&quot;

== Symbolism ==

It bears the dates of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence (May 20, 1775) and of the Halifax Resolves (April 12, 1776), documents that place North Carolina at the forefront of the American independence movement. Both dates also appear on the Seal of North Carolina.

== Salute to the flag ==
The General Assembly of North Carolina adopted an official salute to the flag in 2007. It reads:

<doc id="312320" wikidata="Q950470" url="?curid=312320" title="Garum">
<text>Garum is a fermented fish sauce that was used as a condiment in the cuisines of Phoenicia, ancient Greece, Rome, Carthage and later Byzantium. Liquamen is a similar preparation, and at times they were synonymous. Although garum enjoyed its greatest popularity in the Western Mediterranean and the Roman world, it was in earlier use by the Greeks. The taste of garum is thought to be comparable to that of today&#x27;s Asian fish sauces. 

Like modern fermented fish sauce and soy sauce, garum was a rich source of umami flavoring due to the presence of glutamates. It was used along with murri in medieval Byzantine and Arab cuisine to give a savory flavor to dishes. Murri may derive from garum.

==Manufacture and export==

Pliny the Elder and Isidore of Seville derive the Latin word from the Greek (), a food named by Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Aeschylus. Garos may have been a type of fish, or a fish sauce similar to garum. Pliny stated that garum was made from fish intestines, with salt, creating a liquor, the garum, and the fish paste named (h)allec or allex (similar to , this paste was a byproduct of fish sauce production). A concentrated garum evaporated down to a thick paste with salt crystals was called muria; it would have been used to salt and flavor foods.

The 10th-century Byzantine manual &quot;Geōponika (Agricultural Pursuits)&quot; includes the following recipe for &quot;liquamen&quot;:

Garum was produced in various grades and consumed by all social classes. After the liquid was ladled off the top of the mixture, the remains of the fish, called , were used by the poorest classes to flavor their staple porridge or farinata. The finished product—the of Martial&#x27;s epigram—was apparently mild and subtle in flavor. The best garum fetched extraordinarily high prices, and salt could be substituted for it in a simpler dish. Garum appears in many recipes featured in the Roman cookbook . For example, Apicius (8.6.2–3) gives a recipe for lamb stew, calling for the meat to be cooked with onion and coriander, pepper, lovage, cumin, , oil, and wine, then thickened with flour. The same cookbook mentions garum being used as fish stock to flavor chopped mallow leaves fried in a skillet. 

In the 1st century AD, &quot;liquamen&quot; was a sauce distinct from &quot;garum&quot;, as indicated throughout the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot; IV. By the 5th century or earlier, however, &quot;liquamen&quot; had come to refer to &quot;garum&quot;. The available evidence suggests that the sauce was typically made by crushing the innards of (fatty) pelagic fishes, particularly anchovies, but also sprats, sardines, mackerel, or tuna, and then fermenting them in brine. In most surviving &quot;tituli picti&quot; inscribed on amphorae, where the fish ingredient is shown, the fish is mackerel. Under the best conditions, the fermentation process took about 48 hours. 

The manufacture and export of garum was an element of the prosperity of coastal Greek emporia from the Ligurian coast of Gaul to the coast of Hispania Baetica, and perhaps an impetus for Roman penetration of these coastal regions. Although garum was a staple of the Roman Empire&#x27;s cuisine, few production sites are known to have existed in the Eastern Mediterranean. In 2019 a small 1st-century factory was discovered near Ashkelon. A 2013 storm uncovered Neapolis, a major center of garum production, at Nabeul in Tunisia.

Pliny the Elder spoke of a type of garum that Roman Jews may have used, as normal garum may not have contained exclusively kosher seafood. In the ruins of Pompeii, jars were found containing &quot;kosher garum&quot;, suggesting an equal popularity among Jews there. 

Each port had its own traditional recipe, but by the time of Augustus, Romans considered the best to be garum from Cartagena and Gades in Baetica. This product was called &quot;garum sociorum&quot;, &quot;garum of the allies&quot;. The ruins of a garum factory remain at the Baetian site of Baelo Claudia (in present-day Tarifa) and Carteia (San Roque). Other sites are a large garum factory at Gades (Cadiz) and at Málaga under the Picasso museum. 
Garum was a major export product from Hispania to Rome, and gained the towns a certain amount of prestige. The garum of Lusitania (in present-day Portugal) was also highly prized in Rome, and was shipped directly from the harbour of Lacobriga (Lagos). A former Roman garum factory can be visited in the Baixa area of central Lisbon. Fossae Marianae in southern Gaul, located on the southern tip of present-day France, served as a distribution hub for Western Europe, including Gaul, Germania, and Roman Britain. Garum factories were also located in the province of Mauretania Tingitana (modern Morocco), for example at Cotta and Lixus.

Umbricius Scaurus&#x27; production of garum was key to the economy of Pompeii. The factories where garum was produced in Pompeii have not been uncovered, perhaps indicating that they lay outside the walls of the city. The production of garum created such unpleasant smells that factories were generally relegated to the outskirts of cities. In 2008, archaeologists used the residue from garum found in containers in Pompeii to confirm the August date of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The garum had been made entirely of bogues, fish that congregate in the summer months.

==Cuisine==
When mixed with &quot;oenogarum&quot; (a popular wine-based Byzantine sauce), vinegar, black pepper, or oil, garum enhanced the flavor of a wide variety of dishes, including boiled veal and steamed mussels, even pear-and-honey soufflé. Diluted with water (&quot;hydrogarum&quot;) it was distributed to Roman legions. Pliny (d. 79) remarked in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that it could be diluted to the colour of honey wine and drunk.

==Social aspects==

&quot;Garum&quot; had a social dimension that might be compared to that of garlic in some modern Western societies, or to the adoption of fish sauce in Vietnamese cuisine (called &quot;nước mắm&quot; there). Seneca, holding the old-fashioned line against the expensive craze, cautioned against it, even though his family was from Baetian Corduba:

A surviving fragment of Plato Comicus speaks of &quot;putrid garum&quot;. Martial congratulates a friend on keeping up amorous advances to a girl who had indulged in six helpings of it.

The biological anthropologist Piers Mitchell suggests that garum may have helped spread fish tapeworms across Europe.

== As medicine ==
Garum was also employed as a medicine. It was thought to be one of the best cures for many ailments, including dog bites, dysentery, and ulcers, and to ease chronic diarrhea and treat constipation. Garum was even used as an ingredient in cosmetics and for removal of unwanted hair and freckles.

==Legacy==
Garum remains of interest to food historians and chefs, and has been reintroduced into modern food preparation. In Cádiz, Spain, in 2017, one chef used its flavors for a fish salad recipe, after Spanish archaeologists found evidence of garum in amphorae recovered in the ruins of Pompeii, dating to 79 AD.

Garum is believed to be the ancestor of the fermented anchovy sauce &quot;colatura di alici&quot;, still produced in Campania, Italy, as well as the fermented anchovy and sardine paste &quot;pissalat&quot; in the Nice region, France.

<doc id="312326" wikidata="Q251892" url="?curid=312326" title="Semi-automatic command to line of sight">
<text>Semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) is a method of missile command guidance. In SACLOS, the operator must continually point a sighting device at the target while the missile is in flight. Electronics in the sighting device and/or the missile then guide it to the target.

Many SACLOS weapons are based on an infrared seeker aligned with the operator&#x27;s gunsight or sighting telescope. The seeker tracks the missile, either the hot exhaust from its rocket motor or flares attached to the missile airframe, and measures the angle between the missile and the centerline of the operator&#x27;s sights. This signal is sent to the missile, often using thin metal wires or a radio link, which causes it to steer back toward the center of the line-of-sight. Common examples of these weapons include the BGM-71 TOW wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) and the Rapier radio-command surface-to-air missile (SAM).

Another class of SACLOS weapons is based on the beam riding principle. In this case, a signal is sent from the operator&#x27;s sights toward the target. The signal is generally radio or a laser. The missile has receivers for the signal on the rear of the fuselage. Some form of encoding is used in the signal so that the missile can steer itself into the center of the beam. Changing frequencies or dot patterns are also commonly used. These systems have the advantage that the link between the launcher and missile cannot easily be broken or jammed. But, they have a disadvantage because the guidance signal may be detected by the target. Examples include the laser-guided RBS 70 SAM and 9M120 Svir ATGM.

== Wire and radio-guided SACLOS ==
With wire- and radio-guided SACLOS, the sighting device can calculate the angular difference in direction from the missile position to the target location. It can then give electronic instructions to the missile that correct its flight path so it is flying along a straight line from the sighting device to the target. Most antitank SACLOS systems such as Milan and TOW use a strobe or flare (visible, infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV) light) in the tail of the missile with an appropriate sensor on the firing post, to track the missile&#x27;s flight path. The launching station incorporates a tracking camera with two lenses. A wide field of view lens that locates and &quot;gathers&quot; the missile near the center of the gunners line of sight immediately after launch, and a narrow view lens with automatic zoom that accomplishes the fine tracking adjustments. In most configurations, the narrow field camera utilizes electronics that translate the brightest spot in the view – the flare or strobe of the missile – into an electrical impulse. This impulse changes as the missile leaves the center of the field of view, and the electronics automatically apply a correction instruction in the opposite direction of the change to re-center the missile.

These instructions are delivered either by a radio link or a wire. Radio links have the disadvantage of being jammable, whereas wire links have the disadvantages of being limited to the length of the wire and fragile (i.e. not very good for penetrating/attacking targets in vegetated areas such as forests) and can not be fired over bodies of water due to potential shorting of the wires. Also, wires leave a trace all the way to the target, which could help find the source of the fire. Note that almost all (unless counter counter measures are installed) wire/radio link guided ATGMs can be jammed with electro-optical interference emitters such as &quot;Shtora-1&quot; on the T-90a.

;Examples:
* Wire-guided: HOT, MILAN, Swingfire, AT-4 Spigot, AT-5 Spandrel, M47 Dragon, AT-7 Saxhorn, BGM-71 TOW, Bumbar, Baktar-Shikan
* Radio-guided: ASM-N-2 Bat, 9K33 &#x27;Osa&#x27; (SA-8 &#x27;Gecko&#x27;), Javelin surface to air missile, BGM-71 TOW (Wireless (RF) variants)

== Beam-riding SACLOS ==
With beam-riding SACLOS, the sighting device emits a directional signal directed toward the target. A detector in the tail of the missile looks for the signal. Electronics in the missile then keep it centered in the beam.

It differs from semi-active radar homing (SARH) and semi-active laser homing (SALH) in which the target is illuminated by a powerful emitter, and a sensor in the head of missile detects the reflected emissions and directs it to the target.

Radar was the most common form of SACLOS signals in early systems, because, in the anti-aircraft role, the target is typically already being &quot;illuminated&quot; by a radar signal. However, a beam-riding missile flies directly at the target, which is often inefficient for a high-speed target like an aircraft. For this reason, most anti-aircraft missiles follow their own route to intercept the target, and do not &quot;ride&quot; the beam. A more modern use of beam-riding uses laser signals because they are compact, less sensitive to distance, and are difficult to detect and jam.

This was also one of the main advantages over concurrent SALH systems regarding detection: a laser riding beam emitter is typically a low powered device and does not need to be pointed immediately to the target. Because the missile sensor &quot;looks&quot; backward to it, the whole system is also impervious to most jamming devices. Another advantage in antitank applications is that the backward-looking guidance system does not interfere with the process of jet formation of high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) charges, thus maximizing weapon&#x27;s effectiveness. 

However, such systems don&#x27;t allow for a top-attack mode, or target illumination from a different source than the launcher itself, so choice between the two operating modes may vary between operators. 

The main disadvantage of both SACLOS guidance systems in an anti-tank role is that working on angular differences evaluation, it does not allow any notable separation between guidance system and missile launch post the opposite of manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) ones, thus allowing updated version of such anti-tank weapons (notably AT-3 Malyutka) to still remain in service in some countries.

<text>The Tarantula Nebula (also known as 30 Doradus) is a large H II region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), forming its south-east corner (from Earth&#x27;s perspective).

==Discovery==

The Tarantula Nebula was observed by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille during an expedition to the Cape of Good Hope between 1751 and 1753. He cataloged it as the second of the &quot;Nebulae of the First Class&quot;, &quot;Nebulosities not accompanied by any star visible in the telescope of two feet&quot;. It was described as a diffuse nebula 20&#x27; across.

Johann Bode included the Tarantula in his 1801 &quot;Uranographia&quot; star atlas and listed it in the accompanying &quot;Allgemeine Beschreibung und Nachweisung der Gestirne&quot; catalog as number 30 in the constellation &quot;Xiphias or Dorado&quot;. Instead of being given a stellar magnitude, it was noted to be nebulous.

The name Tarantula Nebula arose in the mid-20th century from its appearance in deep photographic exposures.

30 Doradus has often been treated as the designation of a star, or of the central star cluster NGC 2070, but is now generally treated as referring to the whole nebula area of the Tarantula Nebula.

==Properties==

The Tarantula Nebula has an apparent magnitude of 8. Considering its distance of about 49 kpc (160,000 light-years), this is an extremely luminous non-stellar object. Its luminosity is so great that if it were as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, the Tarantula Nebula would cast visible shadows. In fact, it is the most active starburst region known in the Local Group of galaxies.

It is also one of the largest H II regions in the Local Group with an estimated diameter around 200 to 570 pc (650 to 1860 light years), and also because of its very large size, it is sometimes described as the largest. However, other H II regions such as NGC 604, which is in the Triangulum Galaxy, could be larger. The nebula resides on the leading edge of the LMC where ram pressure stripping, and the compression of the interstellar medium likely resulting from this, is at a maximum.

==NGC 2070==

30 Doradus has at its centre the star cluster NGC 2070 which includes the compact concentration of stars known as R136 that produces most of the energy that makes the nebula visible. The estimated mass of the cluster is 450,000 solar masses, suggesting it will likely become a globular cluster in the future. In addition to NGC 2070, the Tarantula Nebula contains several other star clusters including the much older Hodge 301. The most massive stars of Hodge 301 have already exploded in supernovae.

==Supernova 1987A==
The closest supernova observed since the invention of the telescope, Supernova 1987A, occurred in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula. There is a prominent supernova remnant enclosing the open cluster NGC 2060. Still, the remnants of many other supernovae are difficult to detect in the complex nebulosity.

==Black hole VFTS 243==

An x-ray quiet black hole was discovered in the Tarantula Nebula, the first outside of the Milky Way Galaxy that does not radiate strongly. The black hole has a mass of at least 9 solar masses and is in a circular orbit with its 25 solar mass blue giant companion VFTS 243.

<doc id="312339" wikidata="Q381889" url="?curid=312339" title="Sa Kaeo province">
<text>Sa Kaeo (, ) is one of the 76 provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) and lies in eastern Thailand about 200 km from Bangkok. Neighboring provinces are (from south clockwise) Chanthaburi, Chachoengsao, Prachinburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Buriram. To the east it borders Banteay Meanchey and Battambang of Cambodia.

==History==
Sa Kaeo became a province in 1993, when the six districts Sa Kaeo, Khlong Hat, Wang Nam Yen, Aranyaprathet, Ta Phraya, and Watthana Nakhon of Prachinburi province were elevated to provincial status. It is thus one of the four newest provinces of Thailand, together with Amnat Charoen, Nong Bua Lamphu, and most recently, Bueng Kan.

The province is overwhelmingly Theravada Buddhist (99.4 percent).

In 1979 Sa Kaeo Refugee Camp was established northwest of Sa Kaeo town. It closed in 1989, but the legacy of the border clashes of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s is ever present. The largest land mine field in the world was planted along the Thai-Cambodia border according to some experts. Almost 4,000 people have been injured or killed by landmines in Thailand since the border battles—19 persons in 2017 alone. According to a survey conducted in 2001, 27 of Thailand&#x27;s 76 provinces were plagued with land mines, impacting more than 530 communities and some 500,000 people. Thailand still has approximately 409 km2 of mined area to clear scattered around the country. With an annual clearance rate of about one km2 between 2011 and 2015 the problem will not soon disappear.

The name &quot;Sa Kaeo&quot;, literally &#x27;crystal pond&#x27;, refers to two ponds (&quot;Sa Kaeo Sa Khwan&quot;) containing water thought to be sacred once used for the coronation ceremony. The name of the province originated with this place, now the ponds lie inside a public park next to Mueang Sa Kaeo Municipality Office.

==Geography==
The north of the province is covered with the forested mountains of the Sankamphaeng Range and the Dangrek Mountains. The total forest area in 2021 is or 22 percent of provincial area. To the south are the foothills of the Cardamom Mountains, which are mostly deforested.

===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with two other national parks, make up region 1 (Prachinburi) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Pang Sida National Park, 
* Ta Phraya National Park, 

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the sun rising over archaeological ruins, &quot;Prasat Khao Noi Si Chompu&quot;, a significant Khmer temple. The rising sun symbolizes the location of the province in the east. In the front is a Buddha image in a pond with lotus flowers.

The provincial tree is &quot;Phyllanthus emblica&quot;. The provincial flower is the Orange Jessamine (&quot;Murraya paniculata&quot;). The provincial aquatic life is &quot;Leptobarbus hoevenii&quot;.

The provincial slogan is &quot;Frontier of the east, beautiful forests, splendid waterfalls, ancient civilisations, Thai-Cambodian commerce&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Sa Kaeo is divided into nine districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 59 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 619 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 the province had one Provincial Administration Organisation (PAO) (&quot;&quot;) and 16 municipalities (&quot;thesaban&quot;): Sa Kaeo, Aranyaprathet, and Wang Nam Yen had town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status, with a further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). (Non-municipal areas are administered by 49 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="312341" wikidata="Q179610" url="?curid=312341" title="Alvin (given name)">
<text>Alvin is a male given name. 

In the Balkans, it is popular among Bosniaks in the former Yugoslav nations, as well as among Albanians. The name is a variation of Elvin, another name commonly used within these groups. Its popularity among these communities is likely due to its similarity to Aldin, a name also shared by many in the region.

Additionally, the name is used in other cultures, including English, French, German, Dutch, Polish, Hungarian, and Slovene.

== Etymology ==
Alvin was introduced in the 19th century based on surnames that were in turn derived from the Old English names Æthelwine and Ealdwine. The names mean &quot;noble friend&quot; and &quot;old friend&quot; respectively.

The corresponding German name is Alwin, which continues the Old High German names Albwin and Adalwin.

<text>Carl Flesch (born Károly Flesch, 9 October 1873 – 14 November 1944) was a Hungarian classical violinist and teacher. Flesch’s compendium &quot;Scale System&quot; is a staple of violin pedagogy.

==Life and career==
Flesch was born in Moson (now part of Mosonmagyaróvár) in Hungary in 1873. He began playing the violin at seven years of age. At 10 he was taken to Vienna to study with Jakob Grün. At 17 he left for Paris, and joined the Conservatoire de Paris, studying with Martin Pierre Marsick. He settled in 1903 in Amsterdam, in 1908 in Berlin, and in 1934 in London.

He was known for his solo performances in a very wide range of repertoire (from Baroque music to contemporary), gaining fame as a chamber music performer. He also taught in Bucharest (1897–1902), Amsterdam (1903–08), Philadelphia (1924–28) and Berlin (Hochschule für Musik, 1929–34). He published a number of instructional books, including &quot;Die Kunst des Violin-Spiels&quot; (&quot;The Art of Violin Playing&quot;, 1923) in which he advocated for the violinist as artist rather than merely virtuoso. Among his pupils were Charles Barkel, Edwin Bélanger, Norbert Brainin, Felix Galimir, Bronislaw Gimpel, Ivry Gitlis, Szymon Goldberg, Ida Haendel, Zvi (Heinrich) Haftel, Josef Hassid, Adolf Leschinski, Alma Moodie, Ginette Neveu, Yfrah Neaman, Ricardo Odnoposoff, Eric Rosenblith, Max Rostal, Henryk Szeryng, Henri Temianka, Roman Totenberg and Josef Wolfsthal, all of whom achieved considerable fame as both performers and pedagogues. He said his favorite pupil was the Australian Alma Moodie, who achieved great fame in the 1920s and 1930s but made no recordings and is little known today. In his memoirs he said, &quot;there was above all Henry [i.e., Henri] Temianka, who did great credit to the [Curtis] Institute: both musically and technically, he possessed a model collection of talents.&quot; 

One of Flesch&#x27;s few recordings is a highly distinguished interpretation of Bach&#x27;s great D minor Double Violin Concerto (Columbia) in which he played second violin to the great Joseph Szigeti, with Walter Goehr conducting an anonymous London string orchestra in the late 1930s.

He was consulted (as was Oskar Adler) by Louis Krasner over technical difficulties in Alban Berg&#x27;s Violin Concerto, which Krasner was to premiere.

He owned the &quot;Brancaccio&quot; Stradivarius, but had to sell it in 1931 after losing all his money on the New York Stock Exchange.

Because of his Jewish origins, Flesch had to move to London during the 1930s, and was later arrested by the Gestapo in the Netherlands, was released thanks to Furtwängler&#x27;s intervention, and died in Lucerne, Switzerland, in November 1944.

<doc id="312354" wikidata="Q849622" url="?curid=312354" title="Homologous chromosome">
<text>A pair of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, is a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during fertilization. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci, where they provide points along each chromosome that enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance, which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.

== Overview ==
Chromosomes are linear arrangements of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin. Homologous chromosomes are made up of chromosome pairs of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism&#x27;s mother; the other is inherited from the organism&#x27;s father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents&#x27; genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each homologous chromosome pair, as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each homologous chromosome pair. The alleles on the homologous chromosomes may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a homologous chromosome pair are exchanged with one another.

==History==
Early in the 1900s, William Bateson and Reginald Punnett were studying genetic inheritance and they noted that some combinations of alleles appeared more frequently than others. That data and information was further explored by Thomas Morgan. Using test cross experiments, he revealed that, for a single parent, the alleles of genes near to one another along the length of the chromosome move together. Using this logic he concluded that the two genes he was studying were located on homologous chromosomes.
Later on during the 1930s, Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock were studying meiosis in corn cells and examining gene loci on corn chromosomes. Creighton and McClintock discovered that the new allele combinations present in the offspring and the event of crossing over were directly related. This proved interchromosomal genetic recombination.

== Structure ==
Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism that have similar genes, although not necessarily identical. There are two main properties of homologous chromosomes: 1) the length of chromosomal arms and 2) the placement of the centromere.

The actual length of the arm, in accordance with the gene locations, is critically important for proper alignment. Centromere placement on the chromosome can be characterized by four main arrangements, either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric, or telocentric. Both of these properties (i.e., the length of chromosomal arms, and the placement of the chromosomal centromere) are the main factors for creating structural homology between chromosomes. Therefore, when two chromosomes containing the relatively same structure exist (e.g., maternal chromosome 15 and paternal chromosome 15), they are able to pair together via the process of synapsis to form homologous chromosomes.

Since homologous chromosomes are not identical and do not originate from the same organism, they are different from sister chromatids. Sister chromatids result after DNA replication has occurred, and thus are identical, side-by-side duplicates of each other.

=== In humans ===
Humans have a total of 46 chromosomes, but there are only 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes. The additional 23rd pair is the sex chromosomes, X and Y.

Note that the pair of &quot;sex chromosomes&quot; may or may not be homologous, depending on the sex of the individual. For instance, females contain XX, thus have a homologous pair of sex chromosomes. This means that females have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes in total (i.e., 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes (autosomes), 1 pair of sex chromosomes). Conversely, males contain XY, which means that they have a non-homologous pair of sex chromosomes as their 23rd pair of chromosomes.

In humans, the 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes contain the same genes but code for different traits in their allelic forms, as one was inherited from the mother and one from the father.

So, humans have two sets of 23 chromosomes in each cell that contains a nucleus. One set of 23 chromosomes (n) is from the mother (22 autosomes, 1 sex chromosome (X only)) and one set of 23 chromosomes (n) is from the father (22 autosomes, 1 sex chromosome (X or Y)). Ultimately, this means that humans are diploid (2n) organisms. 

== Functions ==
Homologous chromosomes are important in the processes of meiosis and mitosis. They allow for the recombination and random segregation of genetic material from the mother and father into new cells.

=== In meiosis ===

Meiosis is a round of two cell divisions that results in four haploid daughter cells that each contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It reduces the chromosome number in a germ cell by half by first separating the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and then the sister chromatids in meiosis II. The process of meiosis I is generally longer than meiosis II because it takes more time for the chromatin to replicate and for the homologous chromosomes to be properly oriented and segregated by the processes of pairing and synapsis in meiosis I.
During meiosis, genetic recombination (by random segregation) and crossing over produces daughter cells that each contain different combinations of maternally and paternally coded genes. This recombination of genes allows for the introduction of new allele pairings and genetic variation. Genetic variation among organisms helps make a population more stable by providing a wider range of genetic traits for natural selection to act on.

==== Prophase I ====
In prophase I of meiosis I, each chromosome is aligned with its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex – a protein scaffold – is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing-over, a type of recombination, occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In addition, another type of recombination referred to as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) frequently occurs. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over.

In the process of crossing-over, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes&#x27; lengths. Structures called chiasmata are the site of the exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.

==== Metaphase I ====
In metaphase I of meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes, also known as bivalents or tetrads, line up in a random order along the metaphase plate. The random orientation is another way for cells to introduce genetic variation. Meiotic spindles emanating from opposite spindle poles attach to each of the homologs (each pair of sister chromatids) at the kinetochore.

==== Anaphase I ====
In anaphase I of meiosis I the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart from each other. The homologs are cleaved by the enzyme separase to release the cohesin that held the homologous chromosome arms together. This allows the chiasmata to release and the homologs to move to opposite poles of the cell. The homologous chromosomes are now randomly segregated into two daughter cells that will undergo meiosis II to produce four haploid daughter germ cells.

==== Meiosis II ====
After the tetrads of homologous chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, the sister chromatids from each pair are separated. The two haploid daughter cells (the number of chromosomes has been reduced to half: earlier two sets of chromosomes were present, but now each set exists in two different daughter cells that have arisen from the single diploid parent cell by meiosis I) resulting from meiosis I undergo another cell division in meiosis II but without another round of chromosomal replication. The sister chromatids in the two daughter cells are pulled apart during anaphase II by nuclear spindle fibers, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.

=== In mitosis ===
Homologous chromosomes do not function the same in mitosis as they do in meiosis. Prior to every single mitotic division a cell undergoes, the chromosomes in the parent cell replicate themselves. The homologous chromosomes within the cell will ordinarily not pair up and undergo genetic recombination with each other. Instead, the replicants, or sister chromatids, will line up along the metaphase plate and then separate in the same way as meiosis II – by being pulled apart at their centromeres by nuclear mitotic spindles. If any crossing over does occur between sister chromatids during mitosis, it does not produce any new recombinant genotypes.

=== In somatic cells ===

Homologous pairing in most contexts will refer to germline cells, however also takes place in somatic cells. For example, in humans, somatic cells have very tightly regulated homologous pairing (separated into chromosomal territories, and pairing at specific loci under control of developmental signalling). Other species however (notably &quot;Drosophila&quot;) exhibit homologous pairing much more frequently. In &quot;Drosophila&quot; the homologous pairing supports a gene regulatory phenomenon called transvection in which an allele on one chromosome affects the expression of the homologous allele on the homologous chromosome. One notable function of this is the sexually dimorphic regulation of X-linked genes.

== Problems ==
There are severe repercussions when chromosomes do not segregate properly. Faulty segregation can lead to fertility problems, embryo death, birth defects, and cancer. Though the mechanisms for pairing and adhering homologous chromosomes vary among organisms, proper functioning of those mechanisms is imperative in order for the final genetic material to be sorted correctly.

===Nondisjunction===
Proper homologous chromosome separation in meiosis I is crucial for sister chromatid separation in meiosis II. A failure to separate properly is known as nondisjunction. There are two main types of nondisjunction that occur: trisomy and monosomy. Trisomy is caused by the presence of one additional chromosome in the zygote as compared to the normal number, and monosomy is characterized by the presence of one fewer chromosome in the zygote as compared to the normal number. If this uneven division occurs in meiosis I, then none of the daughter cells will have proper chromosomal distribution and non-typical effects can ensue, including Down&#x27;s syndrome. Unequal division can also occur during the second meiotic division. Nondisjunction which occurs at this stage can result in normal daughter cells and deformed cells.

== Other uses ==

While the main function of homologous chromosomes is their use in nuclear division, they are also used in repairing double-strand breaks of DNA. These double-stranded breaks may occur in replicating DNA and are most often the result of interaction of DNA with naturally occurring damaging molecules such as reactive oxygen species. Homologous chromosomes can repair this damage by aligning themselves with chromosomes of the same genetic sequence. Once the base pairs have been matched and oriented correctly between the two strands, the homologous chromosomes perform a process that is very similar to recombination, or crossing over as seen in meiosis. Part of the intact DNA sequence overlaps with that of the damaged chromosome&#x27;s sequence. Replication proteins and complexes are then recruited to the site of damage, allowing for repair and proper replication to occur. Through this functioning, double-strand breaks can be repaired and DNA can function normally.

== Relevant research ==
Current and future research on the subject of homologous chromosome is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both homologous chromosome synapsis as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis. Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.

There is ongoing research concerning the ability of homologous chromosomes to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Researchers are investigating the possibility of exploiting this capability for regenerative medicine. This medicine could be very prevalent in relation to cancer, as DNA damage is thought to be contributor to carcinogenesis. Manipulating the repair function of homologous chromosomes might allow for bettering a cell&#x27;s damage response system. While research has not yet confirmed the effectiveness of such treatment, it may become a useful therapy for cancer.

<doc id="312355" wikidata="Q1410510" url="?curid=312355" title="Gametogenesis">
<text>Gametogenesis is a biological process by which diploid or haploid precursor cells undergo cell division and differentiation to form mature haploid gametes. Depending on the biological life cycle of the organism, gametogenesis occurs by meiotic division of diploid gametocytes into various gametes, or by mitosis. For example, plants produce gametes through mitosis in gametophytes. The gametophytes grow from haploid spores after sporic meiosis. The existence of a multicellular, haploid phase in the life cycle between meiosis and gametogenesis is also referred to as alternation of generations.

It is the biological process of gametogenesis during which cells that are haploid or diploid divide to create other cells. It can take place either through mitotic or meiotic division of diploid gametocytes into different cells depending on an organism&#x27;s biological life cycle. For instance, gametophytes in plants undergo mitosis to produce gametes. Both male and female have different forms.

==In animals==

Animals produce gametes directly through meiosis from diploid mother cells in organs called gonads (testis in males and ovaries in females). In mammalian germ cell development, sexually dimorphic gametes differentiates into primordial germ cells from pluripotent cells during initial mammalian development. Males and females of a species that reproduce sexually have different forms of gametogenesis:

* spermatogenesis (male): Immature germ cells are produced in a man&#x27;s testes. To mature into sperms, males&#x27; immature germ cells, or spermatogonia, go through spermatogenesis during adolescence. Spermatogonia are diploid cells that become larger as they divide through mitosis. These are primary spermatocytes. These diploid cells undergo meiotic division to create secondary spermatocytes. These secondary spermatocytes undergo a second meiotic division to produce immature sperms or spermatids. These spermatids undergo spermiogenesis in order to develop into sperm. LH, FSH, GnRH, and androgens are just a few of the hormones that help to promote spermatogenesis.
* oogenesis (female)

===Stages===
However, before turning into gametogonia, the embryonic development of gametes is the same in males and females.

====Common path====
Gametogonia are usually seen as the initial stage of gametogenesis. However, gametogonia are themselves successors of primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac migrate along the hindgut to the genital ridge. They multiply by mitosis, and, once they have reached the genital ridge in the late embryonic stage, are referred to as gametogonia. Once the germ cells have developed into gametogonia, they are no longer the same between males and females.

====Individual path====
From gametogonia, male and female gametes develop differently - males by spermatogenesis and females by oogenesis. However, by convention, the following pattern is common for both:

=== Differences between spermatogenesis and oogenesis ===
===In vitro gametogenesis===
In vitro gametogenesis (IVG) is the technique of developing in vitro generated gametes, i.e., &quot;the generation of eggs and sperm from pluripotent stem cells in a culture dish.&quot; This technique is currently feasible in mice and will likely have future success in humans and nonhuman primates. It allows scientists to create sperms and egg cells by reprograming adult cells. This way, they could grow embryos in a laboratory. Even though it is a promising technique for fighting disease, it raises several ethical problems.

==In gametangia==
Fungi, algae, and primitive plants form specialized haploid structures called gametangia, where gametes are produced through mitosis. In some fungi, such as the Zygomycota, the gametangia are single cells, situated on the ends of hyphae, which act as gametes by fusing into a zygote. More typically, gametangia are multicellular structures that differentiate into male and female organs:

* antheridium (male)
* archegonium (female)

==In angiosperms==

In angiosperms, the male gametes (always two) are produced inside the pollen tube (in 70% of the species) or inside the pollen grain (in 30% of the species) through the division of a generative cell into two sperm nuclei. Depending on the species, this can occur while the pollen forms in the anther (pollen tricellular) or after pollination and growth of the pollen tube (pollen bicellular in the anther and in the stigma). The female gamete is produced inside the embryo sac of the ovule.

In angiosperms the division of a generative cell into two, sperm nuclei, resulting in the production male gametes (always two), which develop inside the pollen grain (in 30% of species) or the pollen tube (in 70% of species), respectively, of the plant. This may happen before pollination and the development of the pollen tube, depending on the species, or while the pollen is still forming in the anther (pollen is tricellular) (pollen bicellular in the anther and in the stigma). Inside the embryo sac of the ovule, the female gamete is created.

==Meiosis==

Meiosis is a central feature of gametogenesis, but the adaptive function of meiosis is currently a matter of debate. A key event during meiosis is the pairing of homologous chromosomes and recombination (exchange of genetic information) between homologous chromosomes. This process promotes the production of increased genetic diversity among progeny and the recombinational repair of damage in the DNA to be passed on to progeny. To explain the adaptive function of meiosis (as well as of gametogenesis and the sexual cycle), some authors emphasize diversity, and others emphasize DNA repair.

Although meiosis is a crucial component of gametogenesis, its function in adaptation is still unknown. In sexually reproducing organisms, it is a type of cell division that results in fewer chromosomes being present in gametes.

HOMOLOGY EFFECTS

There are two key differences between mammalian and plant gametogenesis. First, there is no predetermined germline in plants. Male or female gametophyte-producing cells diverge from the reproductive meristem, a totipotent clump of developing cells in the adult plant that creates all the flower&#x27;s features (both sexual and asexual structures). Second, meiosis is followed by mitotic divisions and differentiation to create the gametes. In plants, sister, non-gametic cells are connected to the female gametes (the egg cell and the central cell) (the synergids and the antipodal cells). The haploid microspore passes through a mitosis to create a vegetative and generative cell during male gametogenesis. The generative cell undergoes a second mitotic division, resulting in the creation of two.

Premeiotic, post meiotic, pre mitotic, or postmitotic events are all possibilities if imprints are created during male and female gametogenesis. However, if only one of the daughter cells receives parental imprints following mitosis, this would result in two functionally different female gametes or two functionally different sperm cells. Demethylation is seen in the pollen grain following the second meiosis and before to the generative cell&#x27;s mitosis, as was discussed in the section before this one. Along with pollen differentiation, various structural and compositional DNA alterations also occur. These modifications are potential steps for the genome-wide erasure and/or reprogramming of the imprinting that happens in animals. During the growth of sperm cells, the male DNA is extensively demethylated in plants, whereas the converse is true in animals.

<text>Gylve Fenris Nagell (born Leif Nagell; 28 November 1971), known professionally as Fenriz, is a Norwegian musician, part-time music journalist and online radio host (with the show &quot;Radio Fenriz&quot;) who is best known as being one half of the black metal duo Darkthrone, alongside Nocturno Culto. Although primarily a drummer and songwriter, he has also played bass and guitar and performed vocals for Darkthrone and several other metal bands. Fenriz is famed for his encyclopedic knowledge of metal music, his eager promotion of underground bands and the DIY ethic, and his rejection of the &quot;showbiz side of the music industry&quot;. Fenriz was also the studio drummer for doom metal band Valhall, and has had several solo projects, including the folk black metal project Isengard and the dark ambient project Neptune Towers.

== Biography ==
Fenriz&#x27;s first exposure to heavy metal music came when he was a child and received Uriah Heep&#x27;s album &quot;Sweet Freedom&quot; from his uncle for his birthday. At age 16, Fenriz dropped out of school and began working full time to support his music. In 1986 he co-founded the death metal band Black Death with Ivar Enger and Anders Risberget. By 1988 they had been joined by Ted Skjellum (Nocturno Culto) and were renamed Darkthrone. After releasing their first death metal album in 1991, the band changed style and became one of the leading bands in the early Norwegian black metal scene. Fenriz said he had a passive interest in Bathory and Celtic Frost, but claims that he did not understand the &quot;darkness&quot; of black metal until hearing a song by the Hungarian band Tormentor. The second album released by Darkthrone, &quot;A Blaze in the Northern Sky&quot;, recorded in August 1991 at Creative Studios but not released until February 1992, is regarded as one of the most important albums that defined the black metal genre. Darkthrone were not involved in the church burnings and murders carried out by some other members of the scene, and Fenriz has denounced the &quot;hype&quot; surrounding it.

Since 1993, Darkthrone have been a duo of Fenriz and Nocturno Culto. Fenriz recorded all instruments on their albums &quot;Transilvanian Hunger&quot; (1994) and &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; (1995). From the late 1980s to the mid 1990s Fenriz also founded several solo projects, including the folk black metal project Isengard and the dark ambient project Neptune Towers. He was also the drummer for the band Valhall on their three studio albums. In the 1990s he co-founded the folk metal band Storm with Sigurd Wongraven, which released one album.

Both he and Nocturno have refused to play live since the 1990s. In 2004, they turned down a nomination for a Norwegian Alarm Award for their album &quot;Sardonic Wrath&quot;. Fenriz said, &quot;we have no interest in being part of the glitter and showbiz side of the music industry&quot;. Fenriz (alongside Varg Vikernes) is the principal focus of the 2008 black metal documentary film &quot;Until The Light Takes Us&quot;.

In 2016, it was widely reported that Fenriz had been elected to his local municipal council, Oppegård. He was elected for a four-year term as a substitute councillor for the Liberal Party, explaining that he would &quot;have to step in when the usual people who go to the big meetings are sick or something&quot;. Fenriz said: &quot;They called and asked if I wanted to be on the list [of backup representatives]. I said yeah, thinking I would be like 18th on the list and I wouldn&#x27;t really have to do anything&quot;. His &quot;campaign&quot; was a photo of him holding his cat with the caption &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Vote For Me&quot;.

Fenriz lives in his hometown of Kolbotn. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Fenriz &quot;has long been a hero in the underground scene&quot; and &quot;has an obsession with unearthing new music and promoting it with rabid enthusiasm&quot;. The heavy metal magazine &quot;Iron Fist&quot; noted he has a reputation as a &quot;walking metal encyclopedia&quot;. He is a part-time music journalist and hosts a monthly online radio show on NTS called &quot;Radio Fenriz&quot;. He created the &quot;Band of the Week&quot; blog from which the acts for the underground metal festival Live Evil are sourced. Fenriz has famously been working part-time in the postal service since the late 1980s, which he says allows him to spend many hours each week listening to new music. He has also appeared on a Norwegian television show about hiking in forests.

<doc id="312358" wikidata="Q183329" url="?curid=312358" title="Saffron Walden">
<text>Saffron Walden is a market town and civil parish in the Uttlesford district of Essex, England, north of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, south of Cambridge and north of London. It retains a rural appearance and some buildings of the medieval period. The population was 15,504 at the 2011 census and 16,613 in the 2021 census.

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests continuous settlement on or near the site of Saffron Walden from at least the Neolithic period. It is believed that a small Romano-British settlement and fort – possibly in the area round Abbey Lane – existed as an outpost of the much larger settlement of Cestreforda to the north.

After the Norman invasion of 1066, a stone church was built. Walden Castle, dating from about 1140, may have been built on pre-existing fortifications. A priory, Walden Abbey, was founded under the patronage of Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex about 1136, on the site of what is now Audley End House. The abbey was separated from Walden by Holywell Field. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Sir Thomas Audley converted its cloisters into a dwelling. Later this became the site of Audley End House.
The market was moved from nearby Newport to Walden during de Mandeville&#x27;s tenure, increasing the town&#x27;s influence. This Tuesday market was held from 1295. The town&#x27;s first charter was granted in about 1300, to what was known then as &quot;Chepyng&quot; (i. e. Market) Walden. The town at that time was largely confined to the castle&#x27;s outer bailey, but in the 13th century the Battle or Repel Ditches were built or extended to enclose a larger area to the south. The focus of the town moved southwards to Market Square.

The main trading item in medieval times was wool. A guildhall was built by the wool-staplers in the market place, but demolished in 1847 to make way for the Corn Exchange.

===Saffron===
In the 16th and 17th centuries the saffron crocus (&quot;Crocus sativus&quot;) was widely grown, thanks to the town&#x27;s favourable soil and climate. The stigmas of the flower were used in medicines, as a condiment, in perfume, as an expensive yellow dye, and as an aphrodisiac. The industry gave Walden its present name. In the records of the Court of Common Pleas, the town was called Magna Walden in Hilary Term 1484, and Chipping Walden in the 15th and early 16th centuries, but by the 1540s it had become Saffron Walden.
===Puritans and Quakers===
The town and surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, was strongly Puritan during the 17th century. The population was influenced by the missionary John Eliot. By 1640, Samuel Bass&#x27;s family and a number of others had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the Great Migration.

Saffron Walden was at the centre of the Eastern Association during the English Civil War. While the town was the headquarters of the New Model Army, Lieutenant-General of Horse, Oliver Cromwell paid a 19-day visit in May 1647, taking part in debates to seek a settlement between Parliament and the army. He is thought to have stayed at the &quot;Sun Inn&quot;.

By the end of the 18th century saffron was no longer in demand and the industry was replaced by malt and barley. More than 40 maltings stood in the town by the end of the century. The trade was less lucrative than saffron, but the town continued to grow through the 19th century, and had a cattle market, corn exchange and other civic buildings. During this time Quakers became economically active in the area. The influential Gibsons – one of the founding families of Barclays Bank – aided the construction of several public buildings that remain today, such as the Saffron Walden Museum and the Saffron Walden Town Hall.

In the 1900s the Saffron Walden branch railway line from Audley End station, on the mainline from London to Cambridge, was extended to Bartlow. The branch succumbed to the Beeching cuts in the 1960s.

Heavy industry arrived after the Second World War. Acrows Ltd, makers of falsework, built premises to the east of the town and became a significant employer and economic influence in the area. For a short time there was a dedicated railway station for the works known as Acrow Halt.

===Coat of arms and maces===

Saffron Walden&#x27;s unofficial coat of arms showed the saffron crocus within the walls of the castle in the form of an heraldic pun – as in, &quot;Saffron walled-in&quot;. In 1961, a formal coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms and this was adapted in 1974 into its current form.

The town has three ceremonial maces. The large mace was given to Saffron Walden by James II in 1685 and provides an early recording of the unofficial coat of arms. Made of silver gilt, it is approximately long. Two smaller silver maces were bought by the corporation in 1549 to commemorate the granting of a new town charter by Edward VI. This purchase is recorded in the town&#x27;s Guild of Holy Trinity accounts and reads, &quot;For 2 new maces, weying 18 ownces one quarter and half at 8s. the ownce 7l.7s&quot;.

==Sites and buildings of interest==

The 12th-century Walden Castle, built or expanded by Geoffrey de Mandeville, the first Earl of Essex, is in ruins. After the medieval period, the castle fell into disuse and much of the flint was taken and used in the construction of local houses and the wall surrounding the Audley End estate. All that remains is the ruined basement.

Near the castle is a turf maze, a series of circular excavations cut into the turf of the common. It is the largest example of this style of maze in England, the main part being about in diameter. The earliest record of it dates from 1699, although its origin may be earlier. It has been extensively restored several times, most recently in 1979.

The oldest inhabited building in the town is believed to be the former maltings at 1 Myddleton Place. The 15th-century building with a courtyard garden was used by the Youth Hostel Association from 1947 to 2010. It is now used for functions. &quot;Pevsner&quot; described it as: &quot;without doubt, the best medieval house of Saffron Walden&quot;. Other notable early buildings are in Bridge Street, Castle Street and the side streets off the High Street. The High Street contains some late-Georgian and Victorian buildings.
Bridge End Gardens, seven interlinked gardens – including a maze, rose garden and walled garden – were originally laid out by the Gibson family in about 1840. They have been restored with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund and volunteers.

St Mary the Virgin, Saffron Walden (Church of England) is the largest parish church in Essex. The church dates mainly from the end of the 15th century, when an old smaller church was extensively rebuilt by the master mason John Wastell, who was building King&#x27;s College Chapel in the nearby city of Cambridge. In 1769 it was damaged by lightning and the repairs, carried out in the 1790s, removed many medieval features. The spire was added in 1832 to replace an older lantern tower. The church is long and the spire, high, is the tallest in Essex.

The town&#x27;s Catholic church, Our Lady of Compassion, is on Castle Street. Created in 1906 from a 16th-century barn, it was restored in 2004–5.

With a long history of non-conformism, Saffron Walden has:
* a Baptist church on the High Street,
* a Quaker Friends Meeting House on the High Street,
* a United Reformed Church on Abbey Lane,
* a Methodist church on Castle Street now occupied as the Community Church by the independent former Gold Street Chapel which was located in Gold Street.
==Governance==
Saffron Walden falls in to three local government administrative areas, including Uttlesford District Council and Essex County Council.

The town itself is administered by Saffron Walden Town Council which has 18 members. The majority party is Residents for Uttlesford (&#x27;R4U&#x27;), who are a local political party formed by residents. As of 2024 the mayor is Deryk Eke of Residents for Uttlesford.

The town is divided into four parish wards: Audley, named after Audley End House - representing the western area of Saffron Walden including Audley End; Castle - taking its name from Saffron Walden Castle; Shire (formerly Plantation) - representing the southern area of the town; and Little Walden - representing the small village of the same name and a large rural area to the north of the town.

Nationally, the town is part of the much larger North West Essex Parliamentary constituency. The MP is Conservative, Kemi Badenoch who is Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Conservative Party.

Notable former MPs include:

*Alan Haselhurst from a by-election in 1977 until his retirement at the 2017 general election. Baron Haselhurst was Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons from 1997 to 2010.
*Rab Butler from 1929 to 1965, former Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, who became Lord Butler of Saffron Walden and is buried at the parish church.

In the 1840s Saffron Walden became a municipal borough, the district contained the parish of Saffron Walden. On 1 April 1974 the district and parish were abolished and became part of Uttlesford district. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish.

==Demography==
According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Saffron Walden had a population of 14,313. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 94.5 female-to-male ratio.

==Education==

Saffron Walden County High School is a large co-educational academy with over 2000 pupils. Located to the west of the town centre, it was rated outstanding in its most recent Ofsted report in 2012.

The school replaced Saffron Walden Grammar School, which was established in 1521 by the town&#x27;s Holy Trinity Guild and Dame Joan Bradbury, a local benefactor. Dame Bradbury also founded Dame Bradbury&#x27;s School on Ashdon Road. There has been a school on this site since 1317 but it was in 1521 that Dame Bradbury made this school available for local people. For the first four years Dame Bradbury paid the salary of the schoolmaster herself, until the school was endowed in 1535.

Friends&#x27; School, renamed Walden School, was a co-educational Quaker independent school with roots dating back to 1702. Its final building, in Mount Pleasant Road, opened in 1879. On 11 May 2017 it was announced that Walden School would close at the end of the 2016–17 school year. Its final day was 7 July 2017.

Saffron Walden College, a teachers&#x27; training college for women, closed in 1977.

<doc id="312359" wikidata="Q2492369" url="?curid=312359" title="Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence">
<text>The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence is a text published in 1819 with the now disputed claim that it was the first declaration of independence made in the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution. It was supposedly signed on May 20, 1775, in Charlotte, North Carolina, by a committee of citizens of Mecklenburg County, who declared independence from Great Britain after hearing of the battle of Concord. If true, the Mecklenburg Declaration preceded the United States Declaration of Independence by more than a year.

Professional historians have maintained that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence is an inaccurate rendering of an authentic document known as the Mecklenburg Resolves, an argument first made by Peter Force. The Resolves, a set of radical resolutions passed on May 31, 1775, fell short of an actual declaration of independence. Although published in newspapers in 1775, the text of the Mecklenburg Resolves was lost after the American Revolution and not rediscovered until 1838. Defenders of the Mecklenburg Declaration have argued that both the Mecklenburg Declaration and the Mecklenburg Resolves are authentic.
North Carolinians, convinced that the Mecklenburg Declaration was genuine, and also because of the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress on April 12, 1776, maintained that they were the first Americans to declare independence from Great Britain. The official seal and the flag of North Carolina display the dates of both the declaration and the Halifax vote. A holiday commemorating the Mecklenburg Declaration, &quot;Meck Dec Day,&quot; is celebrated on May 20 in North Carolina, although it is no longer an official holiday and does not attract the attention that it once did.

==Initial publication==
The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was published on April 30, 1819, in an article written by Joseph McKnitt Alexander in the &quot;Raleigh Register and North Carolina Gazette&quot;, of Raleigh, North Carolina. &quot;It is not probably known to many of our readers,&quot; wrote the editor of the &quot;Raleigh Register&quot; in an introduction to the article, &quot;that the citizens of Mecklenburg County, in this State made a Declaration of Independence more than a year before Congress made theirs.&quot;

According to Alexander, his father, John McKnitt Alexander, had been the clerk at a meeting convened in Charlotte on May 19, 1775. Each militia company in Mecklenburg County had sent two delegates to the meeting, where measures were to be discussed regarding the ongoing dispute between the British Empire and the American colonies. Relations between the colonies and British leaders had reached a crisis in Boston, Massachusetts following the 1774 passage of the Coercive Acts by the British Parliament. During the meeting in Mecklenburg County, the delegates received official news that the battle of Lexington had been fought in Massachusetts one month earlier. Outraged by this turn of events, wrote Alexander, the delegates unanimously passed the following resolutions at about 2:00 a.m. on May 20:
:1. Resolved, That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted, or in any way, form, or manner, countenanced the uncharted and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to this County, to America, and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.

:2. Resolved, That we the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby dissolve the political bands which have connected us to the Mother Country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British Crown, and abjure all political connection, contract, or association, with that Nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties and inhumanly shed the innocent blood of American patriots at Lexington.

:3. Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people, are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign and self-governing Association, under the control of no power other than that of our God and the General Government of the Congress; to the maintenance of which independence, we solemnly pledge to each other, our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor.

:4. Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the existence and control of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this County, we do hereby ordain and adopt, as a rule of life, all, each and every of our former laws - where, nevertheless, the Crown of Great Britain never can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities, or authority therein.

:5. Resolved, That it is also further decreed, that all, each and every military officer in this County, is hereby reinstated to his former command and authority, he acting conformably to these regulations, and that every member present of this delegation shall henceforth be a civil officer, viz. a Justice of the Peace, in the character of a &#x27;Committee-man,&#x27; to issue process, hear and determine all matters of controversy, according to said adopted laws, and to preserve peace, and union, and harmony, in said County, and to use every exertion to spread the love of country and fire of freedom throughout America, until a more general and organized government be established in this province.
A few days later, wrote Alexander, Captain James Jack of Charlotte was sent to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Jack carried a copy of the resolves and a letter asking North Carolina&#x27;s congressmen to have the Mecklenburg proceedings approved by Congress. The North Carolina congressional delegation—Richard Caswell, William Hooper, and Joseph Hewes—told Jack that although they supported what had been done, it was premature to discuss a declaration of independence in Congress.

Alexander concluded by writing that although the original documents relating to the Mecklenburg Declaration were destroyed in a fire in 1800, the article was written from a true copy of the papers left to him by his father, who was now deceased.

==Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s skepticism==
The 1819 article about the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was reprinted in many newspapers across the United States. People immediately noticed that, even though the Mecklenburg Declaration was supposedly written more than a year before the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, the two declarations had some very similar phrases, including &quot;dissolve the political bands which have connected&quot;, &quot;absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British Crown&quot;, &quot;are, and of right ought to be&quot;, and &quot;pledge to each other, our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor&quot;. This raised an obvious question: did Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the American Declaration of Independence, use the Mecklenburg Declaration as a source?

One person who thought so was John Adams, who like Jefferson was elderly and in retirement when the Mecklenburg Declaration was published in 1819. When Adams read Dr. Alexander&#x27;s article in a Massachusetts newspaper, he was astonished because he had never previously heard of the Mecklenburg Declaration. He immediately assumed, as he wrote a friend, that Jefferson had &quot;copied the spirit, the sense, and the expressions of it &quot;verbatim&quot; into his Declaration of the 4th of July, 1776.&quot; Adams, who had played a major role in getting the Continental Congress to declare independence in 1776, had become somewhat resentful that Jefferson now received most of the praise for independence just because he had written the now-revered document announcing it. Adams was therefore privately delighted with the emergence of the Mecklenburg Declaration, since it clearly undercut Jefferson&#x27;s claim to originality and precedence. Adams sent a copy of the article to Jefferson to get his reaction.

Jefferson replied that, like Adams, he had never heard of the Mecklenburg Declaration before. Jefferson found it curious that historians of the American Revolution, even those from North Carolina and nearby Virginia, had never previously mentioned it. He also found it suspicious that the original was lost in a fire and that most of the eyewitnesses were now dead. Jefferson wrote that while he could not claim for certain that the Mecklenburg Declaration was a fabrication, &quot;I shall believe it such until positive and solemn proof of its authenticity shall be produced.&quot;

Jefferson&#x27;s argument, Adams wrote in reply, &quot;has entirely convinced me that 
the Mecklengburg Resolutions are a fiction&quot;. Adams forwarded Jefferson&#x27;s letter to the editor of the Massachusetts newspaper, who wrote an article expressing reservations about the Mecklenburg Declaration without mentioning Jefferson or Adams by name. In response to this skepticism, North Carolina senator Nathaniel Macon and others collected eyewitness testimony to the events described in the article. The now elderly witnesses did not agree in every detail, but they generally corroborated the story that a declaration of independence had been read in public in Charlotte, although they were not all certain about the date. Perhaps most importantly, eighty-eight-year-old Captain James Jack was still living, and he confirmed that he had delivered to the Continental Congress a declaration of independence that had been adopted in May 1775. For many, the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration had been firmly established.

==Possible signers==
After the Mecklenburg Declaration was published in 1819, supporters compiled a list of men who they believed had signed the document. William Polk, who said that he had heard his father Thomas Polk read the Declaration to the public, listed the names of fifteen delegates present when the Declaration was adopted; other testimony produced other names. A pamphlet issued in 1831 by the government of North Carolina listed the names of twenty-six delegates. Eventually, supporters of the Declaration settled on a list of twenty-seven or twenty-eight men who they claimed had signed the document. In alphabetical order, they are:
:1. Abraham Alexander
:2. Adam Alexander
:3. Charles Alexander
:4. Ezra Alexander
:5. Hezekiah Alexander
:6. John McKnitt Alexander
:7. Waightstill Avery
:8. Hezekiah J. Balch
:9. Richard Barry
:10. Ephraim Brevard
:11. John Davidson
:12. Henry Downs
:13. John Flenniken
:14. John Foard
:15. William Graham
:16. James Harris
:17. Robert Harris
:18. Robert Irwin
:19. William Kennon
:20. Matthew McClure
:21. Neil Morrison
:22. Duncan Ochiltree
:23. Benjamin Patton
:24. John Phifer
:25. Thomas Polk
:26. John Queary
:27. David Reese
:28. Zacheus Wilson, Sr.
Modern historians have emphasized that the story of the 1775 signing of the Mecklenburg Declaration can be dated no earlier than 1819. There is no contemporaneous evidence of a signing, nor did John McKnitt Alexander mention such an event in his notes. As far as it is known, none of the &quot;signers&quot; ever claimed to have signed the Mecklenburg Declaration.

Most of the listed signers were Scotch-Irish Presbyterians, as were many of the early promoters of the authenticity of the Declaration. Many of the reputed signers were kinsmen, and their descendants were among the staunchest defenders of the Declaration.

Eyewitnesses who provided testimony about the 1775 meeting disagreed about the roles played by some of the signers. John McKnitt Alexander wrote that he had been the secretary at the meeting, but others recalled that Ephraim Brevard had been the secretary. Alexander wrote that his kinsman Adam Alexander had issued the order for the meeting to be convened, but William Polk and other eyewitnesses insisted that Thomas Polk had called the meeting. Abraham Alexander is said to have chaired the meeting.

==Celebration and controversy==
After 1819, people in North Carolina (and Tennessee, which shared an early history) began to take pride in the previously unheralded Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Before then, Virginia and Massachusetts had been given much of the credit for leading the American Revolution. The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence clearly enhanced North Carolina&#x27;s role—already notable because of the Halifax Resolves of April 1776—in establishing American independence. The first celebration of the anniversary of the supposed adoption of the Mecklenburg Declaration took place in Charlotte on May 20, 1825.

Many North Carolinians were offended when Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s skeptical letter about the Mecklenburg Declaration was posthumously published in 1829. In questioning the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration, Jefferson, a Virginian, had impolitically referred to William Hooper, one of North Carolina&#x27;s signers of the American Declaration of Independence, as a &quot;tory&quot;. According to author Hoyt, Jefferson used the term to mean that Hooper had been conservative on declaring independence, not to imply that he had been a Loyalist, but North Carolinians felt their honored Patriots had been slighted.

The state of North Carolina responded to Jefferson&#x27;s letter in 1831 with an official pamphlet that reprinted the previously published accounts with some additional testimony in support of the Mecklenburg Declaration. This was followed in 1834 with a book by a leading North Carolina historian, Joseph Seawell Jones, entitled &quot;A Defence of the Revolutionary History of the State of North Carolina from the Aspersions of Mr. Jefferson.&quot; Jones defended the patriotism of William Hooper and accused Jefferson of being envious that a little county in North Carolina had declared independence at a time when the &quot;Sage of Monticello&quot; was still hoping for reconciliation with Great Britain. On May 20, 1835, more than five thousand people gathered in Charlotte to celebrate the Mecklenburg Declaration. In the many toasts celebrating &quot;the &quot;first&quot; declaration of American independence&quot;, Jefferson was never mentioned.

In 1837, Jefferson&#x27;s first biographer, George Tucker, came to Jefferson&#x27;s defense. In &quot;The Life of Thomas Jefferson&quot;, Tucker argued that Jefferson&#x27;s Declaration of Independence had been fraudulently interpolated into the Mecklenburg Declaration. North Carolina native Francis L. Hawks, a New York Anglican clergyman, responded that Jefferson had instead plagiarized the Mecklenburg Declaration. Hawks&#x27;s position was apparently supported by the discovery of a proclamation by Josiah Martin, the last royal governor of North Carolina, which seemed to confirm the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration. In August 1775, Governor Martin had written that he had:

seen a most infamous publication in the &quot;Cape Fear Mercury&quot; importing to be resolves of a set of people styling themselves a committee for the county of Mecklenburg, most traitorously declaring the entire dissolution of the laws, government, and constitution of this country, and setting up a system of rule and regulation repugnant to the laws and subversive of his majesty&#x27;s government...

Here, at last, was contemporaneous confirmation that radical resolves had been adopted in Mecklenburg County in 1775. Unfortunately, the issue of the &quot;Cape Fear Mercury&quot; that Martin referred to could not be found. Throughout the 19th century, supporters of the Mecklenburg Declaration hoped that the missing paper would be discovered, proving their case. In 1905, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published what was said to be a clipping from the missing issue, but advocates and opponents of the Mecklenburg Declaration agreed that the document was a hoax. It was later confirmed that the &quot;traitorous&quot; document referred to by Governor Martin was not the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, but was instead a radical set of resolutions known as the Mecklenburg Resolves.

==Discovery alters the debate==
In 1838, the case for the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence suffered a setback from which it has not recovered. That year, while examining newspapers published in 1775, archivist Peter Force discovered an abbreviated list of resolutions adopted in Mecklenburg County on May 31, 1775, that were different from the Mecklenburg Declaration of May 20. In 1847, the complete text of these Mecklenburg Resolves was found in a South Carolina newspaper published in June 1775. Unlike the Mecklenburg Declaration that had appeared in the &quot;Raleigh Register&quot; in 1819, the Mecklenburg Resolves fell short of an outright declaration of independence, and did not contain language that was parallel to Jefferson&#x27;s 1776 Declaration of Independence. The Resolves, though comparatively radical, were similar to other local resolutions that were adopted in the colonies in 1774 and 1775.

The controversy over the Mecklenburg Declaration entered a new phase with the discovery of the Mecklenburg Resolves. The focus shifted from Thomas Jefferson to the question of how to account for two very different sets of resolutions supposedly adopted in Charlotte only eleven days apart. How was it possible that citizens of Mecklenburg County declared independence on May 20, and then met again on May 31 to pass less revolutionary resolutions? For skeptics of the Mecklenburg Declaration, the answer was that the Declaration was a misdated, inaccurate recreation of the authentic Resolves. Supporters of the Declaration maintained that both documents were genuine, and were adopted to serve different purposes.

===Argument against===
The argument that the Mecklenburg Declaration is a flawed version of the Mecklenburg Resolves was first made in 1853 by Charles Phillips, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In an influential article in the &quot;North Carolina University Magazine&quot;, Dr. Phillips concluded that John McKnitt Alexander had admitted to having reconstructed the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration from memory in 1800. In 1906, William Henry Hoyt published a scholarly work that many historians have regarded as the conclusive refutation of the Mecklenburg Declaration.

Hoyt&#x27;s argument is briefly as follows: After the original documents relating to the Mecklenburg Resolves were destroyed by fire in 1800, John McKnitt Alexander attempted to recreate them from memory. Alexander made some rough notes, which still survive, and internal evidence indicates that these notes were written after the 1800 fire. Like some of his contemporaries, Alexander mistakenly remembered the radical Mecklenburg Resolves as being an actual declaration of independence. This misconception led Alexander, or perhaps another unknown writer, to borrow language from Jefferson&#x27;s well-known Declaration of Independence when the Mecklenburg Declaration was written from Alexander&#x27;s rough notes. The eleven-day discrepancy between the two sets of resolutions—May 20 and May 31—may result from some confusion of Old Style and New Style dates.

According to this argument, when the elderly eyewitnesses were interviewed after 1819, they naturally could not be expected to verify the wording of a document that they had heard read nearly fifty years earlier, nor remember the exact date of the public reading. The eyewitnesses were misled into accepting the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration as authentic because it had been published in 1819 with the claim that it was a true copy of the original resolutions. Because the actual resolutions had been radical, and British authority in Mecklenburg County had effectively ended in 1775, the eyewitnesses were able to believe that the Mecklenburg Resolves had been an outright declaration of independence. While they undoubtedly told the truth about the events of May 1775 as they remembered them, their testimony was given in response to leading questions, and their answers actually referred to the lost Mecklenburg Resolves. Unfortunately, by the time the authentic text of the Resolves had been rediscovered, all of the eyewitnesses were dead, and so no one could be asked to explain the existence of two different sets of resolutions.

===Argument for===
Advocates of the Mecklenburg Declaration have argued that both the Declaration and the Resolves are authentic. This argument was developed in the 20th century by Professor Archibald Henderson of the University of North Carolina, who, beginning in 1916, wrote numerous articles on the subject. Henderson believed that the evidence showed that Mecklenburg County had adopted two sets of resolutions, that the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration was not recreated from memory, and that the events as described in Alexander&#x27;s 1819 article were substantially correct. His work was supplemented in 1960 by journalist V. V. McNitt&#x27;s book &quot;Chain of Error and the Mecklenburg Declarations of Independence&quot;.

One of the strongest pieces of nearly contemporaneous evidence in support of the Mecklenburg Declaration is a diary entry discovered in 1904. The entry is unsigned and undated, but internal evidence suggests that it was written in 1783 in Salem, North Carolina, by a merchant named Traugott Bagge. The English translation of the German entry reads:

I cannot leave unmentioned at the end of the 1775th year that already in the summer of this year, that is in May, June, or July, the County of Mecklenburg in North Carolina declared itself free and independent of England, and made such arrangements for the administration of the laws among themselves, as later the Continental Congress made for all. This Congress, however, considered these proceedings premature.

Skeptics of the Mecklenburg Declaration argued that the diary entry merely suggests that Bagge, writing eight years after the event, misinterpreted the Mecklenburg Resolves as having been an actual declaration of independence. Archibald Henderson, however, argued that the entry attested to both the Declaration (&quot;declared itself free and independent&quot;) and the Resolves (&quot;arrangements for the administration of the laws&quot;).

==Current status of the debate==
The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence no longer attracts much attention from professional historians, who generally regard the document as spurious. If the declaration is mentioned in scholarly works, it is usually to discount it. Professor William S. Powell, in his standard history &quot;North Carolina through Four Centuries&quot; (1989) relegates the Mecklenburg Declaration to a skeptical footnote; Professor H.G. Jones, in his &quot;North Carolina Illustrated&quot; (Chapel Hill: University of N.C. Press, 1983), pointedly places ironic quotation marks around the name of the declaration. The &quot;Harvard Guide to American History&quot; (1954) lists the Mecklenburg Declaration under the heading of &quot;spurious declarations.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Allan Nevins wrote in 1938 &quot;Legends often become a point of faith. At one time the State of North Carolina made it compulsory for the public schools to teach that Mecklenburg County had adopted a Declaration of Independence on May 20, 1775—to teach what had been clearly demonstrated an untruth.&quot;

In 1997 historian Pauline Maier wrote:
When compared to other documents of the time, the &quot;Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence&quot; supposedly adopted on May 20, 1775, is simply incredible. It makes the reaction of North Carolinians to Lexington and Concord more extreme than that of the Massachusetts people who received the blow. The resolutions of May 31, 1775, of which there is contemporary evidence, were also radical, but remain believable.

Despite much scholarly opinion against the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration, belief in the document remains important to some North Carolinians, says historian Dan L. Morrill, who notes that the possibility that it is genuine cannot be entirely discounted. Morrill writes, &quot;Let&#x27;s make one thing clear. One cannot demonstrate conclusively that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence is a fake. The dramatic events of May nineteenth and May twentieth could have happened. Ultimately, it is a matter of faith, not proof. You believe it or you don&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

Initially in 1975–1979 and then starting again from 2015, North Carolina released a license plate with the words &quot;First in Freedom&quot; and the date of the Declaration of Independence preceded by the date of North Carolina&#x27;s supposed declaration.

==Commemoration==
The early government of North Carolina, convinced that the Mecklenburg Declaration was authentic, maintained that North Carolinians were the first Americans to declare independence from Britain. As a result, both the seal and the flag of North Carolina bear the date of the declaration. Coins have been minted that celebrate the Mecklenburg Declaration, and the story was printed in elementary school textbooks. A monument to the reputed signers of the declaration was unveiled in Charlotte on May 20, 1898, and a commemorative tablet was placed in the rotunda of the North Carolina State Capitol building on May 20, 1912. In 1881, the state legislature made May 20 a legal holiday to commemorate the Mecklenburg Declaration. Sometimes known as &quot;Meck Dec Day&quot;, it is no longer an official holiday and does not attract the attention that it once did.

Four United States presidents visited Charlotte to participate in the Mecklenburg Day celebration: William Howard Taft (1909), Woodrow Wilson (1916), Dwight D. Eisenhower (1954), and Gerald Ford (1975). Aware of the controversy, the presidents generally praised the revolutionary patriots of Mecklenburg County without specifically endorsing the authenticity of the disputed document.

The Mecklenburg Declaration is referenced in the motto for Davidson College, located in Davidson in Mecklenburg and Iredell counties: &quot;Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas&quot; (&quot;Let Knowledge Be Cherished Where Liberty Has Arisen&quot;).

<doc id="312362" wikidata="Q10686720" url="?curid=312362" title="South American cuisine">
<text>South American cuisine has many influences, due to the ethnic fusion of South America. The most characteristic are Native American, African, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Indian-South Asian. However, there is a mix of European, North American, and indigenous cuisines. The customs and food products greatly vary according to the physically distinct regions.

== Overview ==
The Amazon basin of South America provides a plethora of fresh fish and tropical fruits. The Pacific Ocean provides a large amount of seafood, such as king crab (typically caught at the southern end of the continent), lobster (found in great quantities from the Juan Fernández Islands), and Antarctic krill, which was recently discovered. Tuna and tropical fish are caught all around the continent but are notably found in abundance near Easter Island. 

The many plains on this continent make it rich for growing foods like cereals, potatoes and quinoa. In the Patagonia region in the south of Argentina, many people raise sheep and cattle. In Brazil, a traditional dish is &quot;feijoada&quot;, a stew consisting of beans with beef and pork. Rice and beans is also very common in Brazil. 

Peruvian cuisine is largely influenced by traditional Incan culture (see Incan cuisine). The consumption of &quot;carne asada&quot; is widespread throughout much of the continent. It is popular to grill in the open air as in &quot;asado&quot; or &quot;churrasco&quot;. 

Shredded beef is common throughout South America and Latin America and is served with a variety of foods.

== By region ==
=== Andes ===
The food of the Andes is highly influenced by the indigenous peoples. The principal foods continue to be corn, potatoes and other tubers. The meats most characteristic of this zone are the llama (Peru) and the guinea pig (Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and the Argentine northwest). In areas where there is fresh water, trout is consumed. 

&quot;Chupe andino&quot; refers to various stews and soups that are prepared in the Andes mountains region. One of the most important drinks is &quot;chicha&quot;. Important dishes include &quot;humitas&quot;, &quot;locro,&quot; &quot;chanfaina&quot;, &quot;arepas&quot;, &quot;quimbolitos&quot; (dessert tamales), and peppers. A famous dish from the Peruvian Andes is &quot;pachamanca&quot;. From the mixture of German, native cuisine, and the Chiloé Archipelago in the southern Andes comes &quot;valdiviano&quot; and &quot;curanto&quot;.

The wetter areas of Peru produce sugar cane, lemon, bananas, and oranges. &quot;Chancaca&quot; is popular as well as &quot;carbonara&quot;, &quot;sancocho&quot;, &quot;huevos quimbos&quot;, potato pie, and &quot;ch&#x27;arki&quot;.

=== Pampas ===

The pampas have the most Italian and Spanish influences. In Argentina, they are the center of the three typical Argentine dishes &quot;dulce de leche&quot;, &quot;asado&quot; (&quot;churrasco&quot; in Brazil), and &quot;milanesa&quot;. 

Argentine pizza is different from Italian pizza, being closer to calzones. Pasta and polenta are common in Argentina and on the Pampas generally. &quot;Empanadas&quot; and &quot;choripán&quot; are very popular fast food in Argentina and Uruguay. Churros, &quot;ensaïmada&quot;, &quot;alfajor&quot;, Spanish tortillas with potato, meatballs, &quot;sopa de mondongo&quot;, and &quot;puchero&quot; are Spanish-derived Pampas cuisine. &quot;Mate&quot; is popular on the Pampas.

=== Tropical ===

The tropical region of the continent is divided into two distinct areas, the coastal areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Amazon area, each with its distinct cuisines. Much of the fruits that are considered to be exotic are common in the tropical forests and fields, such as guava, pineapple, papaya, mango, banana, and elderberry.

The climate and geography also favour a great variety of crops: potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, complemented with meat and fish; grains, principally rice, corn, and wheat and beans.

In the coastal area &quot;ceviche&quot;, &quot;tostones&quot; or &quot;patacón&quot;, &quot;arepa&quot;, &quot;chipa&quot;, &quot;sancocho&quot;, &quot;pabellón criollo&quot;, &quot;bandeja paisa&quot;, &quot;guatita&quot;, and &quot;sopa paraguaya&quot; are common dishes.

In Brazil, foods such as &quot;feijoada&quot;, &quot;arroz carreteiro&quot; (cart riders rice), &quot;coxinha&quot;, and &quot;farofa&quot; are common throughout the country. The Brazilian state of Bahia has its own cuisine which has heavy African influences.

The Amazon area is known for its utilization of native meats such as the capybara, turtles, peccary, and paca. Common dishes are &quot;juane&quot;, &quot;tacacho&quot;, &quot;tacacá&quot;. There are a wide variety of fruits native to the Amazon with which a great variety of drinks are prepared.

== Diffusion ==
=== Australia ===
As early as the 1950s, Latin American cuisine have been transported to the Southeast coast, where Sydney is. Now there is a slight selection of Latin American restaurants that has spread across the country.

=== United States ===
Early South American restaurants in the United States included Caso do Brazil in Reseda, California, which opened in 1955, and the Machu Picchu nightclub in Miami, Florida, which opened in 1963, serving Peruvian dishes such as &quot;ceviche&quot; and &quot;anticuchos&quot;. South American foods are increasingly imported into the United States, especially Brazilian foods such as &quot;guarana&quot;, guava paste, and &quot;cachaça&quot; (an ingredient in the &quot;caipirinha&quot; cocktail).

<text>Missile d&#x27;Infanterie Léger Antichar (French for &quot;Lightweight Infantry Anti-tank Missile&quot;) or MILAN is a Franco-West German anti-tank guided missile system. Design of the MILAN began in 1962; it was ready for trials in 1971, and accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire-guided semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit must be aimed at a target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability.

&quot;Milan&quot; is also a common name in French and German to designate a kite bird.

==Background==
MILAN is a product of Euromissile, a Franco-West German missile development program dating back to the 1960s. The system entered service in 1972 as a second generation anti-tank weapon and soon became a standard anti-tank weapon throughout NATO, in use by most of the alliance&#x27;s individual armies.

Consisting of two main components, the launcher and the missile, the MILAN system uses a semi-automatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) command guidance system. It tracks the missile either by a tail-mounted infrared lamp or an electronic-flash lamp, depending on the model. Because it is guided by wire by an operator, the missile cannot be affected by radio jamming or flares. However, drawbacks include short range, exposure of the operator, and problems with overland powerlines.

The MILAN 2 variant, which entered service with the French, German and British armies in 1984, uses an improved 115 mm high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge warhead. The MILAN 3 entered service with the French army in 1995 and features a new-generation localizer that makes the system more difficult to jam electronically.

==Variants==

* MILAN 1: Single, main shaped charge warhead (1972), calibre 103 mm
* MILAN 2: Single, main shaped charge warhead, with standoff probe to increase penetration (1984) – see photo to right, calibre 115 mm
* MILAN 2T: Tandem shaped charge warheads to defeat reactive armour (1993)
* MILAN 3: Tandem, shaped charge warheads (1996) and electronic beacon to defeat Shtora jammer
* MILAN ER: Extended range (3,000 m) and improved penetration

The later MILAN models have tandem-charge HEAT warheads. This was done to keep pace with developments in Soviet armour technology: their tanks began to appear with explosive reactive armour (ERA), which could defeat earlier anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs). The smaller precursor HEAT warhead penetrates and detonates the ERA tiles, exposing the way for the main HEAT warhead to penetrate the armour behind. Early missile versions used a simple flare to show the launch post their position left–right and above–below the crosshair, which then led to steering commands (SACLOS guidance). This was exploited with IR jammers such as Soviet Shtora that created a strong signal that was always on target, and thus led to wrong steering commands. The later electronic IR beacon used a coded signal sequence (switching between emitting and not emitting) that enabled the launch post to discern the missile&#x27;s beacon from the jammer.

Both the explosive reactive armour and the guidance jamming provided excellent frontal protection for well-equipped Warsaw Pact main battle tanks against Milan and other 1980&#x27;s SACLOS-guided anti-tank missiles until both were countered through technical means after the end of the Cold War.

==Combat use==
===Afghanistan===
MILAN missile systems were among the numerous weapons sent to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s by the United States to combat Soviet troops. The MILAN had a devastating effect on Soviet armor, having a similar effect on tanks and armored personnel carriers as Stinger missiles had had on Soviet helicopters. In 2010, French troops killed four Afghan civilians in Kapisa Province using a MILAN system during a firefight.

===Chadian–Libyan conflict===
MILAN missiles provided by the French government saw common usage during the war between Chad and Libya where they were used by Chadian forces. Often mounted on Toyota pickup trucks, the missiles successfully engaged Libyan armour in the Aouzou Strip including T-55 tanks.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, the ruling military junta in Argentina launched the invasion of the UK overseas territory of the Falkland Islands, leading to the Falklands War. British forces used MILAN, along with the M72 LAW and Carl Gustaf, in a &#x27;bunker buster&#x27; role. The MILAN saw use in the battles for Goose Green, Mount Longdon, Two Sisters and Wireless Ridge.

===Gulf War===
MILAN was used by both coalition and Iraqi forces during the Persian Gulf War, with a MILAN launcher operated by French forces claiming to have destroyed seven T-55 tanks. Iraqi operated MILAN missiles were supplied by the French government during the 1980s and were used by Iraqi forces during both Gulf Wars.

===Iraq===
In 2015, Germany supplied the Peshmerga with 30 MILAN launchers and over 500 missiles. Those missiles were mostly used against ISIS forces, but on 20 October during the 2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, Kurdish forces destroyed an Iraqi M1 Abrams tank and several Humvees using the MILANs.

===Syria===
Syria ordered about 200 launchers and 4,000 missiles in 1977 which were delivered in 1978-1979 and used by the Syrians during the Lebanese Civil War. The Syrian army used Milan missiles against Israeli tanks in Lebanon in 1982. The missiles were in service during the Syrian Civil War, fielded by the Republican Guard. Syrian rebels captured some in depots, as did ISIL. The Kurdish YPG also used Milans supplied by the international coalition.
===South Africa===
The first Milan version was delivered to the Special Forces and the antitank platoons in the late 1970s and 1980s at a scale of six launchers per platoon. Each platoon was organised into three antitank sections, with two ATGM launchers and two M40A1 106 mm recoilless guns or two rocket launchers.

Six SADF MILAN teams were deployed by the Special Forces in support of the Angolan UNITA guerrillas, in the Cazombo Salient in 1985 during Operation Wallpaper.

=== Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
France has sent MILAN missiles to Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. There have been unconfirmed footage of it being used by the Ukrainian military on Russian targets. Russian forces have also been seen using captured MILANs.

<doc id="312368" wikidata="Q1286715" url="?curid=312368" title="Edmund Pettus">
<text>Edmund Winston Pettus (July 6, 1821 – July 27, 1907) was an American lawyer, politician and military officer who represented Alabama in the United States Senate from 1897 to 1907. He served as a senior officer of the Confederate States Army, commanding infantry in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. After the war, he was Grand Dragon, or supreme leader of the Ku Klux Klan, that terrorized and often killed African-Americans.

The Edmund Pettus Bridge across the Alabama River in Selma, built in 1940, was named after him. According to &quot;Smithsonian&quot;, &quot;The bridge was named for him, in part, to memorialize his history, of restraining and imprisoning African-Americans in their quest for freedom after the Civil War&quot;. In 1965, the bridge became a landmark of the civil rights movement.

==Early life and career==
Edmund Pettus was born in 1821 in Limestone County, Alabama. He was the youngest of nine children of John Pettus and Alice Taylor Winston, a brother of John J. Pettus, and a distant cousin of Jefferson Davis. Pettus was educated in local public schools, and later graduated from Clinton College located in Smith County, Tennessee.

Pettus then studied law under William Cooper in Tuscumbia, Alabama and was admitted to the bar in 1842. Shortly afterward, he settled in Gainesville and began practicing as a lawyer. On June 27, 1844, Pettus married Mary L. Chapman, with whom he had three sons, two of whom died in infancy, and two daughters. Also that year he was elected solicitor for the seventh Judicial Circuit of Alabama.

During the Mexican–American War in 1846–48, Pettus served as a lieutenant with the Alabama Volunteers, and after the end of hostilities he moved to California.

By 1853, he returned to Alabama, serving again in the seventh circuit as solicitor. He was appointed a judge in that circuit in 1855 until resigning in 1858. Pettus then relocated to the now extinct town of Cahaba in Dallas County, Alabama, where he again took up work as a lawyer.

==American Civil War==

In 1861, Pettus, an enthusiastic champion of the Confederate cause and of slavery, was a Democratic Party delegate to the secession convention in Mississippi, where his brother John was serving as governor. Pettus helped organize the 20th Alabama Infantry, and was elected as one of its first officers. On September 9, he was made the regiment&#x27;s major, and on October 8, he became its lieutenant colonel.

Pettus served in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. During the Stones River Campaign, he was captured by Union soldiers on December 29, 1862, and exchanged a short time later for Union soldiers. Pettus was captured again on May 1, 1863, while part of the surrendered garrison that had been defending Port Gibson in Mississippi. He managed to escape and return to his own lines. Pettus was promoted to colonel on May 28, and given command of the 20th Alabama.

During the 1863 Vicksburg Campaign, Pettus and his regiment were part of the force defending Confederate control of the Mississippi River. When the garrison surrendered on July 4, Pettus was again a prisoner until his exchange on September 12. Six days later he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, and on November 3 he was given brigade command in the Army of Tennessee. Pettus and his brigade participated in the Chattanooga Campaign, posted on the extreme southern slope of Missionary Ridge on November 24, and fought during the action the following day.

Pettus and his command took part in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign, fighting in the battles of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, Atlanta on July 22, and Jonesborough from August 31 to September 1. Beginning on December 17, he temporarily led a division in the Army of Tennessee. During the 1865 Campaign of the Carolinas, Pettus was sent to defend Columbia, South Carolina, and fought at Bentonville from March 19–21. Pettus was wounded in this fight, hit in his right leg during the battle&#x27;s first day. On May 2 he was paroled from Salisbury, North Carolina, and, four months after the Confederacy surrendered, Pettus was pardoned by U.S. President Andrew Johnson on October 20.

==Later life and career==
After the war, Edmund Pettus returned to Alabama and resumed his law practice in Selma. Pettus served as chairman of the state delegation to the Democratic National Convention for more than two decades. In 1877, during the final year of Reconstruction, Pettus was named Grand Dragon of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan. With earnings from his law practice, he bought farm land.

In 1896, at the age of 75, Pettus ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat and won, beating incumbent James L. Pugh. The state legislature, rather than state voters, elected United States senators at that time. His campaign relied on his successes in organizing and popularizing the Alabama Klan and his prominent opposition to the constitutional amendments following the Civil War that elevated former slaves to the status of free citizens. On March 4, 1897, he began service in the U.S. Senate. The state legislature re-elected him on January 26, 1903, and January 22, 1907. This term would begin two years later in 1909.

Pettus died at Hot Springs, North Carolina, in the summer of 1907, at age 86, while still in office and elected for the next term. He is buried in Live Oak Cemetery in Selma.

==Legacy==
Military historian Ezra J. Warner wrote that Pettus was &quot;a fearless and dogged fighter and distinguished himself on many fields in the western theater of war&quot; and after his promotion to a general officer &quot;he followed with conspicuous bravery every forlorn hope which the Confederacy offered...&quot; Likewise historian Jon L. Wakelyn summed up his military career by saying &quot; … he volunteered for service in the Confederate Army and distinguished himself in the western command.&quot; As a U.S. senator, Pettus was &quot;the last of the Confederate brigadiers to sit in the upper house of the national Congress.&quot;

===Edmund Pettus Bridge===
In 1940, a bridge across the Alabama River in Selma was named after him. In 1965, it became a civil rights movement landmark when 525 to 600 civil rights marchers on their way from Selma to Montgomery tried to cross the bridge, but were turned back and attacked by Alabama state troopers and members of the Ku Klux Klan. This event has since been called Bloody Sunday.

In 2020, Pettus’ great-great-granddaughter Caroline Randall Williams, Vanderbilt University writer-in-residence, proposed renaming the bridge after John Lewis because &quot;We name things after honorable Americans to commemorate their legacies. That bridge is named after a treasonous American who cultivated and prospered from systems of degradation and oppression before and after the Civil War.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Williams argued:
At least one other Pettus descendant, Dave Pettus, supports renaming the bridge &quot;Bloody Sunday Bridge.&quot;

<text>Extra Half Brite (also referred to as Extra-Half-Brite, Extra-Halfbrite, or EHB), is a planar display mode of the Amiga computer.

This mode uses six bit planes (six bits per pixel). The first five bit planes index 32 colors selected from a 12-bit color space of 4096 possible colors. If the bit on the sixth bit plane is set, the display hardware halves the brightness of the corresponding color component. This way 64 simultaneous colors are possible (32 arbitrary colors plus 32 half-bright components) while using only 32 color registers. The number of color registers is a hardware limitation of pre-AGA chipsets in Amiga computers.

Some contemporary games (&quot;Fusion&quot;, &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot;, &quot;Agony&quot;, &quot;Lotus II&quot;, or &quot;Unreal&quot;) and animations (&quot;HalfBrite Hill&quot;) use EHB mode as a hardware-assisted means to display shadows or silhouettes. EHB is often used as general-purpose 64 color mode with its own restrictions.

Some early versions of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, sold in the United States, lack the EHB video mode, which is present in all later Amiga models.

<text>Rozonda Ocielian Thomas (born February 27, 1971), also known by her stage name Chilli, is an American singer, dancer and actress who is a member of the group TLC, one of the best-selling girl groups of the late 1990s.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Columbus, Georgia and graduated from Benjamin Elijah Mays High School in 1989. Her father, Abdul Ali, is of Bangladeshi and Arab descent, while her mother, Ava Thomas, is African American and Native American.

Thomas, who had been raised by her mother, later allowed the &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot; television talk show to air footage of her meeting her father for the first time in 1996, when she was 25.
When she was a child, her great-grandmother, whom she called Big Mama, took her to the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

==Music career==
===1991–present: TLC===

Thomas was first a dancer for Damian Dame. In 1991, she joined TLC, replacing founding member Crystal Jones, and was nicknamed &quot;Chilli&quot; by Lisa Lopes so that the group could retain the name TLC. The group went on to sell over 65 million records worldwide and became the best-selling American girl group of all-time; only the Spice Girls had sold more. Chilli has won four Grammy Awards for her work with TLC.

In the spring of 1995, Thomas appeared and participated in the track &quot;Freedom (Theme from Panther)&quot; first appeared on the soundtrack to Melvin Van Peebles&#x27; movie &quot;Panther&quot; as TLC, along with SWV, Xscape, En Vogue, Jade, Brownstone and others.

Since the death of group member Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes in April 2002, Thomas and Tionne &quot;T-Boz&quot; Watkins have occasionally performed as a duo. In 2009, Thomas and Watkins performed a series of concerts in Asia.

In late 2011, VH1 announced plans to produce a biopic on TLC to air in 2013. Thomas and Watkins signed on as producers. Actress and singer Keke Palmer portrayed Thomas in &quot;&quot;.

In 2019, Thomas lost her voice and was ordered by doctors not to sing. TLC then had to cancel their singing for the California State Fair and the Stanislaus State Fair.

===Solo career===

Thomas began working on a solo album in 2000 after the completion of promotion for TLC&#x27;s third album, &quot;FanMail&quot; (1999). She paused production when work began on the next TLC album, &quot;3D&quot; (2002). In 2006, it was reported that she had signed with Akon&#x27;s record label Konvict Muzik and that her debut album would be released the following year, but this never came to fruition. In early April 2008, Thomas&#x27;s first official solo single, &quot;Dumb, Dumb, Dumb&quot; was released. In 2012, she performed a track called &quot;Flirt&quot; on a second season episode of &quot;Single Ladies&quot;.

In January 2016, she released the single &quot;Body&quot;, which served to promote her fitness workout campaign.

==Acting and television roles==
Thomas has made guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;That 70s Show,&quot; &quot;Living Single&quot; and &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;. In 1992, she had a brief cameo in the music video for &quot;Jump&quot; by Kris Kross. In 2000, she was featured in the made-for-television movies &quot;A Diva&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; (with close friend Monica), and in the film &quot;Snow Day&quot;. In 2001, she co-starred in the action film &quot;Ticker,&quot; directed by Albert Pyun. She also played a small role in &quot;House Party 3&quot; and the 1997 film &quot;Hav Plenty&quot;.

In 2005, Thomas and Watkins looked for a new TLC member in the reality series &quot;R U The Girl&quot;.
In June 2009, VH1 announced the airing of a reality TV series starring Thomas. The series, &quot;What Chilli Wants&quot;, which documents Thomas&#x27;s quest to find love and manage her life with the help of love and relationship expert Tionna Tee Smalls, premiered on April 11, 2010. The second season of &quot;What Chilli Wants&quot; premiered on January 2, 2011. In 2011, Thomas made cameo appearances throughout the first season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Single Ladies&quot;. In 2012, Thomas appeared as the leading lady in R&amp;B singer Tyrese&#x27;s music video for his single &quot;Nothing On You&quot;.

In 2013, Thomas became a member of &quot;Team Guy&quot; on the second season of Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. She appeared naked in a PETA anti-circus ad campaign. Thomas also appeared on episode 14 of WWE Countdown where she spoke about The Rock. Thomas was later a judge for truTV&#x27;s reality series Fake Off, which premiered on October 27, 2014.

In 2017, she portrayed Zora Neale Hurston in &quot;Marshall&quot;, a biographical film about the life of Thurgood Marshall.

==Personal life==
At age 20, Thomas became pregnant by producer Dallas Austin. Due to career aspirations and outside pressures, she aborted the pregnancy. She later revealed that she regretted the decision. Thomas and Austin continued their relationship and later had a son, Tron Austin (born June 2, 1997).

In 2001, Thomas began dating Usher, after she starred in his music videos for &quot;U Remind Me&quot;, &quot;U Got It Bad&quot;, and &quot;U Don&#x27;t Have to Call&quot;. Their relationship ended in 2003.

In late 2022, Thomas began dating actor Matthew Lawrence. The pair went public with their relationship in January 2023.

She is a member of the Granite Bay Seventh-day Adventist Church.

== Other ventures ==
Thomas and the other members of TLC were big proponents of encouraging safe sex. For the music video of the song, &quot;Ain&#x27;t 2 Proud 2 Beg&quot; Thomas and her band members wore condoms on their clothing. In 2003, Thomas and Watkins teamed up with Agouron Pharmaceuticals to create a national education program about HIV/AIDS. The program supplied people with information about HIV/AIDS, including prevention and treatment.

In 2012, Thomas started a non-profit organization called &quot;Chilli&#x27;s Crew&quot;. The organization is an Atlanta-based program targeted at helping girls between the ages of 13 and 17 build healthy levels of self-esteem.

In 2013, Thomas took a stand against cyberbullying after her son Tron was a victim. The gossip site MediaTakeOut.com targeted Thomas&#x27;s son because of his apparel and questioned his sexuality. In response, Thomas created a petition through change.org to get the article deleted from the site and to stop staff members from gossiping about minors entirely. In her petition, she described what cyberbullying is and statistics about some of the victims. The site ended up removing the article and issuing an apology to her son.

<text>In probability theory, the law (or formula) of total probability is a fundamental rule relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events, hence the name.

==Statement==
The law of total probability is a theorem that states, in its discrete case, if formula_1 is a finite or countably infinite set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events, then for any event formula_2

:formula_3

or, alternatively,

:formula_4

where, for any formula_5, if formula_6, then these terms are simply omitted from the summation since formula_7 is finite.

The summation can be interpreted as a weighted average, and consequently the marginal probability, formula_8, is sometimes called &quot;average probability&quot;; &quot;overall probability&quot; is sometimes used in less formal writings.

The law of total probability can also be stated for conditional probabilities: 

:formula_9

Taking the formula_10 as above, and assuming formula_11 is an event independent of any of the formula_10:

:formula_13

==Continuous case==
The law of total probability extends to the case of conditioning on events generated by continuous random variables. Let formula_14 be a probability space. Suppose formula_15 is a random variable with distribution function formula_16, and formula_2 an event on formula_14. Then the law of total probability states 

formula_19

If formula_20 admits a density function formula_21, then the result is 

formula_22

Moreover, for the specific case where formula_23, where formula_24 is a Borel set, then this yields 

formula_25

==Example==
Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory &quot;X&quot;&#x27;s bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99% of cases, whereas factory &quot;Y&quot;&#x27;s bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95% of cases. It is known that factory &quot;X&quot; supplies 60% of the total bulbs available and Y supplies 40% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?

Applying the law of total probability, we have:

: formula_26

where
* formula_27 is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory &quot;X&quot;;
* formula_28 is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory &quot;Y&quot;;
* formula_29 is the probability that a bulb manufactured by &quot;X&quot; will work for over 5000 hours;
* formula_30 is the probability that a bulb manufactured by &quot;Y&quot; will work for over 5000 hours.

Thus each purchased light bulb has a 97.4% chance to work for more than 5000 hours.

==Other names==
The term law of total probability is sometimes taken to mean the law of alternatives, which is a special case of the law of total probability applying to discrete random variables.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} One author uses the terminology of the &quot;Rule of Average Conditional Probabilities&quot;, while another refers to it as the &quot;continuous law of alternatives&quot; in the continuous case. This result is given by Grimmett and Welsh as the partition theorem, a name that they also give to the related law of total expectation.

<text>The International Birdman was a series of English competitions held in the West Sussex towns of Bognor Regis, Selsey and Worthing. The competition involved human &#x27;birdmen&#x27; attempting to fly off the end of a pier into the sea for prize money. The event began in 1971 and was held on piers in West Sussex, on the south coast of England. First held in Selsey, the event moved to Bognor Regis in 1978. In 2008 and 2009 the competition relocated to Worthing Pier due to renovations of Bognor Regis Pier. From 2010 Bognor Regis and Worthing have both held Birdman competition, forming the International Birdman Series, which ended in 2016. It was the longest running Birdman Rally in the world.

==Format==
The competition involves running off an elevated ramp of 20 to 35 feet high at the end of a pier and attempting to &#x27;fly&#x27; the furthest distance. There was an initial prize of £1,000 for anyone who could travel beyond . Since starting, the prize money and qualifying distance has increased and in 2009 at Worthing it stood at £30,000 for reaching . The competition is divided between serious aviators mainly flying hang-gliders (Condor Class), inventors with home designed and built machines (Leonardo da Vinci Class), and people in fancy dress with little or no actual flying ability (Kingfisher Class), raising money for charity.

==History==
The event started in 1971 as the International Bird-Man Rally in Selsey on the coast of Sussex. The event was initiated by George Abel, as part of a fund-raising activity for the Selsey branch of the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA) Club. Abel, a former RAF photographer, emigrated to Australia shortly afterwards, where he also helped to organise Birdman events.

In 1978 organisers were informed they could no longer use the pier at Selsey and the event was moved to Bognor Regis. By 1983 the competition had attracted European teams and the attention of the BBC. In 2008, because of the demolition of an 18 metre (60 ft) length of the end of Bognor pier, the 2008 Birdman event was not staged in Bognor, due to safety concerns over water depth at high tide being at the new end of the pier. The 2008 and 2009 competitions were held in Worthing as a result of the safety concerns. After safety checks in 2009 the water depth was cleared by the Health and Safety Executive as safe for competition. Events have subsequently been staged in both Worthing and Bognor Regis, creating the International Birdman series. Bognor&#x27;s 2014 event was cancelled, but the event returned there in 2015.

Birdman competitions have also been held in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

== Recent events ==
In February 2016 the organisers of the Worthing event announced its cancellation for the foreseeable future. Bognor Birdman took place on 3 and 4 September 2016, although the second day&#x27;s flying was curtailed because of safety concerns over high winds and choppy sea. International Bognor Birdman 2021 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was expected to return in 2022.

==Winners==
In 1984 Harold Zimmer from West Germany flew 57.8 metres to claim the top prize, which then stood at £10,000. By 1990 the record was 71 metres, the prize distance had been increased to 100 metres and the prize money was £25,000. The prize money later stood at £30,000 for successfully reaching 100m, and for three consecutive years – 2013, 2014 and 2015 – that record was broken at Worthing.
==Reviews==
From 1994 until 2001, in Brighton, Eastbourne and Bognor Regis, Dod Miller immortalised these human &quot;birds&quot; with his Rolleiflex camera. Supermen, witches, dinosaurs, butterflies, ostriches, penguins and winged species of all kinds posed for Miller ready for their take off, armed with goggles and swimming flippers. 

Photographer Dodik &quot;Dod&quot; Miller (born 1960) has said that a photograph of a birdman dressed as a knight in armour jumping off a pier was his best shot. He commented:

At Bognor and Worthing ... people would launch themselves off piers strapped into homemade contraptions – often in fancy dress – and try to fly. ... I don&#x27;t know who the guy in this image is. There was metalwork involved in the horse, or dragon, or whatever it was, and it was on wheels. He started out riding on top of it like a knight in shining armour ... What I like about these pictures is that these are English eccentrics hoping to fly – with all the connotations of Icarus – and the joke is that they only go down, not out ... There was an array of bird costumes, of course. You&#x27;d see hats with propellers attached, while one guy tried to get a lift by holding massive bunches of helium balloons. It wasn&#x27;t all men: there were some very brave women too. Many contenders are raising money for charity – and it&#x27;s quite a height they jump from. I&#x27;ve seen people seriously winded. There&#x27;s a boat to collect them from the water. 

==2009 Worthing distance controversy==
In 2009, Steve Elkins flew the 100m course entering the water at the finishing markers. A £30,000 prize was offered to any competitor completing the distance. Organisers said that he had fallen at 99.8m, 20 cm short of the 100m marker. However, Elkins claimed that video footage showed he had exceeded the distance. Elkins took the event organisers to court, but in February 2014 a judge ruled against him, saying that he was ‘not satisfied’ that the competitor had crossed the mark.

<doc id="312397" wikidata="Q2247110" url="?curid=312397" title="Law of total expectation">
<text>The proposition in probability theory known as the law of total expectation, the law of iterated expectations (LIE), Adam&#x27;s law, the tower rule, and the smoothing theorem, among other names, states that if formula_1 is a random variable whose expected value formula_2 is defined, and formula_3 is any random variable on the same probability space, then

:formula_4

i.e., the expected value of the conditional expected value of formula_1 given formula_3 is the same as the expected value of formula_1.

The conditional expected value formula_8, with formula_3 a random variable, is not a simple number; it is a random variable whose value depends on the value of formula_3. That is, the conditional expected value of formula_1 given the &quot;event&quot; formula_12 is a number and it is a function of formula_13. If we write formula_14 for the value of formula_15 then the random variable formula_8 is formula_17.

One special case states that if formula_18 is a finite or countable partition of the sample space, then

:formula_19

==Example==
Suppose that only two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory formula_1&#x27;s bulbs work for an average of 5000 hours, whereas factory formula_3&#x27;s bulbs work for an average of 4000 hours. It is known that factory formula_1 supplies 60% of the total bulbs available. What is the expected length of time that a purchased bulb will work for?

Applying the law of total expectation, we have:

: formula_23

where
* formula_24 is the expected life of the bulb;
* formula_25 is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory formula_1;
* formula_27 is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory formula_3;
* formula_29 is the expected lifetime of a bulb manufactured by formula_1;
* formula_31 is the expected lifetime of a bulb manufactured by formula_3.

Thus each purchased light bulb has an expected lifetime of 4600 hours.

==Informal proof==
When a joint probability density function is well defined and the expectations are integrable, we write for the general case
formula_33
A similar derivation works for discrete distributions using summation instead of integration. For the specific case of a partition, give each cell of the partition a unique label and let the random variable &quot;Y&quot; be the function of the sample space that assigns a cell&#x27;s label to each point in that cell.

==Proof in the general case==
Let formula_34 be a probability space on which two sub σ-algebras formula_35 are defined. For a random variable formula_36 on such a space, the smoothing law states that if formula_37 is defined, i.e.
formula_38, then

:formula_39

Proof. Since a conditional expectation is a Radon–Nikodym derivative, verifying the following two properties establishes the smoothing law:

* formula_40-measurable
* formula_41 for all formula_42

The first of these properties holds by definition of the conditional expectation. To prove the second one,

:formula_43

so the integral formula_44 is defined (not equal formula_45).

The second property thus holds since
formula_46 implies
:formula_47

Corollary. In the special case when formula_48 and formula_49, the smoothing law reduces to
:formula_50

Alternative proof for formula_51

This is a simple consequence of the measure-theoretic definition of conditional expectation. By definition, formula_52 is a formula_53-measurable random variable that satisfies
:formula_54
for every measurable set formula_55. Taking formula_56 proves the claim.

<text>In mathematics, an autonomous system or autonomous differential equation is a system of ordinary differential equations which does not explicitly depend on the independent variable. When the variable is time, they are also called time-invariant systems.

Many laws in physics, where the independent variable is usually assumed to be time, are expressed as autonomous systems because it is assumed the laws of nature which hold now are identical to those for any point in the past or future.

== Definition ==

An autonomous system is a system of ordinary differential equations of the form
formula_1
where takes values in -dimensional Euclidean space; is often interpreted as time.

It is distinguished from systems of differential equations of the form
formula_2
in which the law governing the evolution of the system does not depend solely on the system&#x27;s current state but also the parameter , again often interpreted as time; such systems are by definition not autonomous.

== Properties ==

Solutions are invariant under horizontal translations:

Let formula_3 be a unique solution of the initial value problem for an autonomous system 
formula_4
Then formula_5 solves
formula_6
Denoting formula_7 gets formula_8 and formula_9, thus 
formula_10
For the initial condition, the verification is trivial,
formula_11

==Example==
The equation formula_12 is autonomous, since the independent variable (formula_13) does not explicitly appear in the equation. 
To plot the slope field and isocline for this equation, one can use the following code in GNU Octave/MATLAB

Ffun = @(X, Y)(2 - Y) .* Y; % function f(x,y)=(2-y)y
[X, Y] = meshgrid(0:.2:6, -1:.2:3); % choose the plot sizes
DY = Ffun(X, Y); DX = ones(size(DY)); % generate the plot values
quiver(X, Y, DX, DY, &#x27;k&#x27;); % plot the direction field in black
hold on;
contour(X, Y, DY, [0 1 2], &#x27;g&#x27;); % add the isoclines(0 1 2) in green
title(&#x27;Slope field and isoclines for f(x,y)=(2-y)y&#x27;)

One can observe from the plot that the function formula_14 is formula_13-invariant, and so is the shape of the solution, i.e. formula_16 for any shift formula_17.

Solving the equation symbolically in MATLAB, by running 

syms y(x);
equation = (diff(y) == (2 - y) * y);
% solve the equation for a general solution symbolically
y_general = dsolve(equation);

obtains two equilibrium solutions, formula_18 and formula_19, and a third solution involving an unknown constant formula_20,
-2 / (exp(C3 - 2 * x) - 1).

Picking up some specific values for the initial condition, one can add the plot of several solutions
% solve the initial value problem symbolically
% for different initial conditions
y1 = dsolve(equation, y(1) == 1); y2 = dsolve(equation, y(2) == 1);
y3 = dsolve(equation, y(3) == 1); y4 = dsolve(equation, y(1) == 3);
y5 = dsolve(equation, y(2) == 3); y6 = dsolve(equation, y(3) == 3);
% plot the solutions
ezplot(y1, [0 6]); ezplot(y2, [0 6]); ezplot(y3, [0 6]);
ezplot(y4, [0 6]); ezplot(y5, [0 6]); ezplot(y6, [0 6]);
title(&#x27;Slope field, isoclines and solutions for f(x,y)=(2-y)y&#x27;)
legend(&#x27;Slope field&#x27;, &#x27;Isoclines&#x27;, &#x27;Solutions y_{1..6}&#x27;);
text([1 2 3], [1 1 1], strcat(&#x27;\leftarrow&#x27;, {&#x27;y_1&#x27;, &#x27;y_2&#x27;, &#x27;y_3&#x27;}));

grid on;
== Qualitative analysis ==
Autonomous systems can be analyzed qualitatively using the phase space; in the one-variable case, this is the phase line.

== Solution techniques ==

The following techniques apply to one-dimensional autonomous differential equations. Any one-dimensional equation of order formula_21 is equivalent to an formula_21-dimensional first-order system (as described in reduction to a first-order system), but not necessarily vice versa.

=== First order ===

The first-order autonomous equation
formula_23
is separable, so it can be solved by rearranging it into the integral form
formula_24

=== Second order ===

The second-order autonomous equation
formula_25
is more difficult, but it can be solved by introducing the new variable
formula_26
and expressing the second derivative of formula_13 via the chain rule as
formula_28
so that the original equation becomes
formula_29
which is a first order equation containing no reference to the independent variable formula_30. Solving provides formula_31 as a function of formula_13. Then, recalling the definition of formula_31:

formula_34

which is an implicit solution.

====Special case: ====

The special case where formula_35 is independent of formula_36

formula_37

benefits from separate treatment. These types of equations are very common in classical mechanics because they are always Hamiltonian systems.

The idea is to make use of the identity

formula_38

which follows from the chain rule, barring any issues due to division by zero.

By inverting both sides of a first order autonomous system, one can immediately integrate with respect to formula_13:

formula_40

which is another way to view the separation of variables technique. The second derivative must be expressed as a derivative with respect to formula_13 instead of formula_30:

formula_43

To reemphasize: what&#x27;s been accomplished is that the second derivative with respect to formula_30 has been expressed as a derivative of formula_13. The original second order equation can now be integrated:

formula_46

This is an implicit solution. The greatest potential problem is inability to simplify the integrals, which implies difficulty or impossibility in evaluating the integration constants.

====Special case: ====

Using the above approach, the technique can extend to the more general equation

formula_47

where formula_21 is some parameter not equal to two. This will work since the second derivative can be written in a form involving a power of formula_36. Rewriting the second derivative, rearranging, and expressing the left side as a derivative:

formula_50

The right will carry +/− if formula_21 is even. The treatment must be different if formula_52:

formula_53

=== Higher orders ===

There is no analogous method for solving third- or higher-order autonomous equations. Such equations can only be solved exactly if they happen to have some other simplifying property, for instance linearity or dependence of the right side of the equation on the dependent variable only (i.e., not its derivatives). This should not be surprising, considering that nonlinear autonomous systems in three dimensions can produce truly chaotic behavior such as the Lorenz attractor and the Rössler attractor.

Likewise, general non-autonomous equations of second order are unsolvable explicitly, since these can also be chaotic, as in a periodically forced pendulum.

===Multivariate case===

In formula_54, where formula_55 is an formula_21-dimensional column vector dependent on formula_30.

The solution is formula_58 where formula_59 is an formula_60 constant vector.

=== Finite durations ===

For non-linear autonomous ODEs it is possible under some conditions to develop solutions of finite duration, meaning here that from its own dynamics, the system will reach the value zero at an ending time and stay there in zero forever after. These finite-duration solutions cannot be analytical functions on the whole real line, and because they will be non-Lipschitz functions at the ending time, they don&#x27;t stand uniqueness of solutions of Lipschitz differential equations.

As example, the equation:
:formula_61
Admits the finite duration solution:
:formula_62

<text>An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain, that presents a common and clearly defined routing policy to the Internet. Each AS is assigned an autonomous system number (ASN), for use in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing. Autonomous System Numbers are assigned to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) and end-user organizations by their respective Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which in turn receive blocks of ASNs for reassignment from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The IANA also maintains a registry of ASNs which are reserved for private use (and should therefore not be announced to the global Internet).

Originally, the definition required control by a single entity, typically an Internet service provider (ISP) or a very large organization with independent connections to multiple networks, that adhered to a single and clearly defined routing policy. In March 1996, the newer definition came into use because multiple organizations can run BGP using private AS numbers to an ISP that connects all those organizations to the Internet. Even though there may be multiple autonomous systems supported by the ISP, the Internet only sees the routing policy of the ISP. That ISP must have an officially registered ASN.

Until 2007, AS numbers were defined as 16-bit integers, which allowed for a maximum of 65,536 assignments. Since then, the IANA has begun to also assign 32-bit AS numbers to regional Internet registries (RIRs). These numbers are written preferably as simple integers, in a notation referred to as &quot;asplain&quot;, ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (hexadecimal 0xFFFF FFFF). Or, alternatively, in the form called &quot;asdot+&quot; which looks like &quot;x.y&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are 16-bit numbers. Numbers of the form &quot;0.y&quot; are exactly the old 16-bit AS numbers. The special 16-bit ASN 23456 (&quot;AS_TRANS&quot;) was assigned by IANA as a placeholder for 32-bit ASN values for the case when 32-bit-ASN capable routers (&quot;new BGP speakers&quot;) send BGP messages to routers with older BGP software (&quot;old BGP speakers&quot;) which do not understand the new 32-bit ASNs.

The first and last ASNs of the original 16-bit integers (0 and 65,535) and the last ASN of the 32-bit numbers (4,294,967,295) are reserved and should not be used by operators; AS0 is used by all five RIRs to invalidate unallocated space. ASNs 64,496 to 64,511 of the original 16-bit range and 65,536 to 65,551 of the 32-bit range are reserved for use in documentation. ASNs 64,512 to 65,534 of the original 16-bit AS range, and 4,200,000,000 to 4,294,967,294 of the 32-bit range are reserved for Private Use.

The number of unique autonomous networks in the routing system of the Internet exceeded 5,000 in 1999, 30,000 in late 2008, 35,000 in mid-2010, 42,000 in late 2012, 54,000 in mid-2016 and 60,000 in early 2018.
The number of allocated ASNs exceeded 100,000 as of March 2021.

==Assignment==
AS numbers are assigned in blocks by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to regional Internet registries (RIRs). The appropriate RIR then assigns ASNs to entities within its designated area from the block assigned by IANA. Entities wishing to receive an ASN must complete the application process of their RIR, LIR or upstream service provider and be approved before being assigned an ASN. Current IANA ASN assignments to RIRs can be found on the IANA website. RIRs, as part of NRO, can revoke AS numbers as part of their Internet governance abilities.

==ASN table==
A complete table of available 16-bit and 32-bit ASN:

==Types==
Autonomous systems (AS) can be grouped into four categories, depending on their connectivity and operating policy.

# &quot;multihomed&quot;: An AS that maintains connections to more than one other AS. This allows the AS to remain connected to the Internet in the event of a complete failure of one of their connections. However, unlike a transit AS, this type of AS would not allow traffic from one AS to pass through on its way to another AS.
# &quot;stub&quot;: An AS that is connected to only one other AS. This may be an apparent waste of an AS number if the network&#x27;s routing policy is the same as its upstream AS&#x27;s. However, the stub AS may have peering with other autonomous systems that is not reflected in public route-view servers. Specific examples include private interconnections in the financial and transportation sectors.
# &quot;transit&quot;: An AS that acts as a router between two ASes is called a transit. Since not all ASes are directly connected with every other AS, a transit AS carries data traffic between one AS to another AS to which it has links.
# &quot;Internet Exchange Point&quot; (IX or IXP): A physical infrastructure through which ISPs or content delivery networks (CDNs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems). These are often groups of local ISPs that band together to exchange data by splitting the costs of a local networking hub, avoiding the higher costs (and bandwidth charges) of a Transit AS. IXP ASNs are usually transparent. By having presence in an IXP, ASes shorten the transit path to other participating ASes, thereby reducing network latency and improving round-trip delay.

== AS-SET ==
Autonomous systems can be included in one or more AS-SETs, for example AS-SET of RIPE NCC &quot;AS-12655&quot; has AS1, AS2 and AS3 as its members, but AS1 is also included in other sets in ARIN (AS-INCAPSULA) and APNIC (AS-IMCL). Another AS-SET sources can be RADB, LEVEL3 (tier 1 network now called Lumen Technologies) and also ARIN has ARIN-NONAUTH source of AS-SETs. AS-SETs are created by network operators in an Internet Routing Registry (IRR), like other route objects, and can be included in other AS-SETs and even form cycles.

AS-SET names usually start with &quot;AS-&quot;, but can also have a hierarchical name. For example, the administrator of AS 64500 may create an AS-SET called &quot;AS64500:AS-UPSTREAMS&quot;, to avoid conflict with other similarly named AS-SETs.

AS-SETs are often used to simplify management of published routing policies. A routing policy is published in the IRR using &quot;import&quot; and &quot;export&quot; (or the newer &quot;mp-import&quot; and &quot;mp-export&quot;) attributes, which each contain the source or destination AS number and the AS number imported or exported. Instead of single AS numbers, AS-SETs can be referenced in these attributes, which simplifies management of complex routing policies.

<doc id="312408" wikidata="Q1055879" url="?curid=312408" title="Law of total variance">
<text>The law of total variance is a fundamental result in probability theory that expresses the variance of a random variable in terms of its conditional variances and conditional means given another random variable . Informally, it states that the overall variability of can be split into an “unexplained” component (the average of within-group variances) and an “explained” component (the variance of group means).

Formally, if and are random variables on the same probability space, and has finite variance, then:

formula_1

This identity is also known as the variance decomposition formula, the conditional variance formula, the law of iterated variances, or colloquially as Eve’s law, in parallel to the “Adam’s law” naming for the law of total expectation.

In actuarial science (particularly in credibility theory), the two terms formula_2 and formula_3 are called the expected value of the process variance (EVPV) and the variance of the hypothetical means (VHM) respectively.

== Explanation ==
Let be a random variable and another random variable on the same probability space. The law of total variance can be understood by noting:

# formula_4 measures how much varies around its conditional mean formula_5
# Taking the expectation of this conditional variance across all values of gives formula_2, often termed the “unexplained” or within-group part.
# The variance of the conditional mean, formula_7, measures how much these conditional means differ (i.e. the “explained” or between-group part).

Adding these components yields the total variance formula_8, mirroring how analysis of variance partitions variation.

== Examples ==

=== Example 1 (Exam Scores) ===
Suppose five students take an exam scored 0–100. Let = student’s score and indicate whether the student is *international* or *domestic*:

* Mean and variance for international: formula_9
* Mean and variance for domestic: formula_10

Both groups share the same mean (50), so the explained variance formula_7 is 0, and the total variance equals the average of the within-group variances (weighted by group size), i.e. 800.

=== Example 2 (Mixture of Two Gaussians) ===
Let be a coin flip taking values with probability and with probability . Given Heads, ~ Normal(formula_12); given Tails, ~ Normal(formula_13). Then
formula_14
formula_15
so
formula_16

=== Example 3 (Dice and Coins) ===
Consider a two-stage experiment:
# Roll a fair die (values 1–6) to choose one of six biased coins.
# Flip that chosen coin; let =1 if Heads, 0 if Tails.

Then formula_17 The overall variance of becomes
formula_18
with formula_19 uniform on formula_20

== Proof ==

=== Discrete/Finite Proof ===
Let formula_21, formula_22, be observed pairs. Define formula_23 Then
formula_24
where formula_25 Expanding the square and noting the cross term cancels in summation yields:
formula_26

=== General Case ===
Using formula_27 and the law of total expectation:
formula_28
Subtract formula_29 and regroup to arrive at
formula_30

== Applications ==

=== Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) ===
In a one-way analysis of variance, the total sum of squares (proportional to formula_8) is split into a “between-group” sum of squares (formula_7) plus a “within-group” sum of squares (formula_33). The F-test examines whether the explained component is sufficiently large to indicate has a significant effect on .

=== Regression and R² ===
In linear regression and related models, if formula_34 the fraction of variance explained is
formula_35
In the simple linear case (one predictor), formula_36 also equals the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient between and .

=== Machine Learning and Bayesian Inference ===
In many Bayesian and ensemble methods, one decomposes prediction uncertainty via the law of total variance. For a Bayesian neural network with random parameters formula_37:
formula_38
often referred to as “aleatoric” (within-model) vs. “epistemic” (between-model) uncertainty.

=== Actuarial Science ===
Credibility theory uses the same partitioning: the expected value of process variance (EVPV), formula_39 and the variance of hypothetical means (VHM), formula_40 The ratio of explained to total variance determines how much “credibility” to give to individual risk classifications.

=== Information Theory ===
For jointly Gaussian formula_41, the fraction formula_42 relates directly to the mutual information formula_43 In non-Gaussian settings, a high explained-variance ratio still indicates significant information about contained in .

=== Generalizations ===
The law of total variance generalizes to multiple or nested conditionings. For example, with two conditioning variables formula_44 and formula_45:
formula_46
More generally, the law of total cumulance extends this approach to higher moments.

<doc id="312415" wikidata="Q729648" url="?curid=312415" title="Metacomet">
<text>Metacomet (1638 – August 12, 1676), also known as Pometacom, Metacom, and by his adopted English name King Philip, was sachem (elected chief) to the Wampanoag people and the second son of the sachem Massasoit. His older brother Wamsutta (or King Alexander) briefly became sachem after their father&#x27;s death in 1661. However, Wamsutta also died shortly thereafter and Metacom became sachem in 1662. 

His brother&#x27;s widow Weetamoo, female sachem of the Pocasset, became Metacom&#x27;s ally and friend for the rest of his life. It is unclear how many children they had or what happened to them. Wootonekanuske and one of their sons were sold into slavery in the West Indies following the defeat of the Native Americans in what became known as King Philip&#x27;s War.

Initially, Metacom sought to live in harmony with the colonists. As a sachem, he took the lead in much of his tribes&#x27; trade with the colonies. He adopted the European name of Philip. 

The colonies continued to expand. To the west, the Iroquois Confederation also was fighting against neighboring tribes in the Beaver Wars, pushing them from the west and encroaching on Metacom&#x27;s territory. Finally, in 1671, the colonial leaders of the Plymouth Colony forced major concessions from him. Metacom surrendered much of his tribe&#x27;s armament and ammunition, and agreed that they were subject to English law. The encroachment continued until hostilities broke out in 1675.

==Name change==
In the spring of 1660, Metacom&#x27;s brother Wamsutta appeared before the court of Plymouth to request that he and his brother be given English names in accordance with Wampanoag custom, in which new names marked significant moments in time (such as, in this case, Wamsutta&#x27;s father&#x27;s death). The court agreed and Wamsutta had his name changed to Alexander, and Metacom&#x27;s was changed to Philip. Author Nathaniel Philbrick has suggested that the Wampanoag may have taken action at the urging of Wamsutta&#x27;s interpreter, the Christian neophyte John Sassamon. Metacom was later called &quot;King Philip&quot; by the English.

==King Philip&#x27;s War==


King Philip used tribal alliances to coordinate efforts to push European colonists out of New England. Many of the native tribes in the region wanted to push out the colonists following conflicts over land use, diminished game as a consequence of expanding European settlement, and other tensions.

As the colonists brought their growing numbers to bear, King Philip and some of his followers took refuge in the great Assowampset Swamp in southern Massachusetts. He held out for a time, with his family and remaining followers.

Hunted by a group of rangers led by Captain Benjamin Church, King Philip was fatally shot by a praying Indian named John Alderman, on August 12, 1676, in the Miery Swamp near Mount Hope in Bristol, Rhode Island. He was shot by Alderman for killing his brother. After his death, his wife and nine-year-old son were captured and sold as slaves in Bermuda. Philip&#x27;s head was mounted on a pike at the entrance to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where it remained for more than two decades. His body was cut into quarters and hung in trees. Alderman was given Philip&#x27;s right hand as a trophy.

==Representations==
* Mary Rowlandson, who was taken captive during a raid on Lancaster, Massachusetts, later wrote a memoir about her captivity, and described meeting with Metacom while she was held by his followers.
* Washington Irving relates a romanticized but sympathetic version of Metacom&#x27;s life in the 1820 sketch &quot;Philip of Pokanoket,&quot; published in his collected stories, &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; (1820).
* John Augustus Stone wrote the play &quot;Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags&quot; (1829) for the notable actor Edwin Forrest as lead.
* In his short story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; (1937), Stephen Vincent Benét portrays Metacom as a villain to the colonists, and as being killed by a blow to the head (he was shot in the heart). Webster is portrayed as respecting Metacom as one of those who &quot;formed American history.&quot; Metacomet, together with other famous historical villains, is a juror in the &quot;trial of the damned&quot;. When convinced that his damnation resulted in his loss of admiration for the natural world, he ultimately takes Webster&#x27;s side against the Devil. In the film he is replaced by Asa, the Black Monk.

<doc id="312418" wikidata="Q2296872" url="?curid=312418" title="Venison">
<text>Venison originally meant the meat of a game animal but now refers primarily to the meat of deer (or antelope in South Africa). Venison can be used to refer to any part of the animal, so long as it is edible, including the internal organs. Venison, much like beef or pork, is categorized into specific cuts, including roast, sirloin, and ribs.

==Etymology==

The word derives from the Latin &quot;venari&quot;, meaning &quot;to hunt or pursue&quot;. This term entered the English language through Norman French &quot;venaison&quot; in the 11th century, following the Norman conquest of England and the establishment of Royal Forests.

==Definition==
&quot;Venison&quot; originally described meat of any game animal killed by hunting and was applied to any animal from the families Cervidae (true deer), Leporidae (rabbits and hares), Suidae (wild boar) and certain species of the genus &quot;Capra&quot; (goats and ibex).

In Southern Africa, the word &quot;venison&quot; refers to the meat of antelope, a Bovidae taxon, as there are no native Cervidae in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Qualities==
Venison may be eaten as steaks, , roasts, sausages, jerky, and minced meat. It has a flavor reminiscent of beef. Cuts of venison tend to have a finer texture and be leaner than comparable cuts of beef. However, like beef, leaner cuts can be tougher as well. Venison burgers are typically so lean as to require the addition of fat in the form of bacon, beef, olive oil, or cheese to achieve parity with hamburger cooking time, texture, and taste. Organ meats (offal) of deer can also be eaten. Traditionally, they are called &quot;hombres&quot; (originally the Middle English &quot;hombres&quot;). This is supposedly the origin of the phrase &quot;humble pie&quot;, meaning a pie made from the organs of a deer.

==Health benefits and concerns==
When sourced correctly from a healthy deer, venison can be a very healthy meat for human consumption. Deer live on a natural diet of grass and wild plants without ever being confined to a cage or injected with any artificial hormones. Venison is higher in moisture and protein, more diverse in amino acids, and lower in calories, cholesterol, and fat than most cuts of grain-fed beef, pork, or lamb.

However, since it is unknown whether chronic wasting disease (CWD) – a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy among deer – can pass from deer to humans through the consumption of venison, there have been some fears of dangerous contamination of the food supply from wild deer carrying CWD. The disease has been found among farmed deer in the US and western Canada, but New Zealand has not identified the disease among its herd.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; parasite can also be transmitted through human consumption of undercooked or raw venison if it did not reach an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C) for whole pieces of meat, or 160 °F (74 °C) for ground venison. The CDC also says that freezing meat for several days in sub-zero (0 °F or −18 °C) temperatures can greatly reduce the chances of infection by toxoplasmosis.

Hunters should briefly observe the behavior of the living animal and not shoot a deer that appears sick or is acting strangely. They are also advised to take general precautions in examining the meat from deer they have killed.

== Availability ==

=== Czech Republic ===
Venison (as well as other game meats, mainly wild boar) is a part of the traditional cuisine of the country and is commonly eaten, not considered a specialty. Dishes such as deer goulash are often on restaurant menus. A variety of venison (roe, red and fallow deer, mouflon) and other game meat is widely available in butcher shops in fresh state, distributed by wholesalers, as well as in big retail chains such as Tesco, at prices similar to beef or pork, around 200 CZK or 8 EUR per kilogram. Despite the popularity and low prices, in recent years the production of venison has surpassed demand, and is therefore often used in production of animal food.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand has large populations of wild and farmed deer, making venison a relatively common meat. It is widely available in supermarkets.

===United Kingdom===
In England, hunting rights were restricted in an effort to preserve property rights. As a result, the possession and sale of venison was tightly regulated under English law, although it is readily available commercially.

===United States===
In the United States, venison is less common at retail due to the requirement that the animal first be inspected by USDA inspectors. There are very few abattoirs which process deer in North America, and most of this venison is destined for restaurants. Where deer are considered an invasive species, companies such as Molokai Wildlife Management and Maui Nui Venison that hunt axis deer in Hawaii, combine culling with USDA certification and retail sale. Most venison sold through retail in the United States are farmed from New Zealand and Tasmania. It is available through some high-end specialty grocers and some chains which focus on more &quot;natural&quot; meats. Non-retail venison is often obtained through hunting and self-processing or contracting to small meat processing facilities to do the processing for the hunter, but sale of the finished meat is usually illegal.

The American sandwich chain Arby&#x27;s gained attention in October 2016 when word leaked through social media that they were about to test a venison sandwich. Arby&#x27;s later confirmed that they had selected 17 stores in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin (all major deer hunting states) to offer a venison sandwich during a four-day test during those states&#x27; hunting seasons. Both due to curiosity and heavy demand from hunters, the sandwiches sold out in all markets on the first day of the test.

<text>In astronomy, background commonly refers to the incoming light from an apparently empty part of the night sky.

Even if no visible astronomical objects are present in given part of the sky, there always is some low luminosity present, due mostly to light diffusion from the atmosphere (diffusion of both incoming light from nearby sources, and of man-made Earth sources like cities). In the visible band, luminosity level is around the 22nd magnitude per square-arcsecond: a very low level, but anyway well within the limits of the current generation of telescopes. The Hubble Space Telescope does not suffer from this problem.

In infrared astronomy, the problem can be much worse: due to the longer wavelengths involved, the sky and the telescope themselves are a source of light. To work around this problem, infrared telescopes often use a technique called chopping, where a mirror rapidly oscillates between the object of interest and the nearby, empty sky. The two images can be subtracted, leaving hopefully only the incoming light from the source.

There are several sources which contribute to the brightness of the (night) sky. Some of these are instrumental, or due to the presence of the atmosphere (like the airglow), in the case of ground-based instruments. Even if we able to minimize the effect of instrumental and atmospheric components (e.g. using a spacecraft), there are still several astrophysical components contributing to the sky background: these could be sets of point sources like faint asteroids, Galactic stars and far away galaxies, as well as diffuse sources like dust in the Solar System, in the Milky Way, and in the intergalactic space. The actual importance of a specific component depends mostly of the wavelength of the measurement. The uncertainty (or noise) of the measurements caused by the astrophysical components of the sky background is called confusion noise.

In astronomical CCD technology, background is usually referred to the overall optical &quot;noise&quot; of the system, that is, the incoming light on the CCD sensor in absence of light sources. This background can originate from electronic noise in the CCD, from not-well-masked lights nearby the telescope, and so on. An exposure on an empty patch of the sky is also called a background, and is the sum of the system background level plus the sky&#x27;s one.

A background frame is often the first exposure in an astronomical observation with a CCD: the frame will then be subtracted from the actual observation result, leaving in theory only the incoming light from the astronomical object being observed.

<text>Musica is a bronze statue that sits upon a grassy knoll in Nashville, Tennessee, at the center of a traffic rotary where the confluence of Division Street and 16th Avenue North happens, known as the Music Row Roundabout or Buddy Killen Circle.

It is located directly across from Owen Bradley Park in Nashville&#x27;s Music Row district. It was built as part of an urban renewal project for the Music Row neighborhood and unveiled in 2003.

==Composition==
&quot;Musica&quot; is Alan LeQuire&#x27;s largest sculpture commission to date, and currently the largest sculpture group in the United States. It features nine nude figures, male and female, dancing in a circular composition approximately 38 feet (11.5 m) tall. There are five figures which spring forth from the base. Four more rise up in the center floating above the others. The pinnacle of the statue is a female holding a tambourine. The scale of each figure is fourteen to fifteen feet, or more than twice life-size. The dancers and part of the base are cast in bronze. The other part of the base is composed of massive natural limestone boulders, which are prevalent in the Nashville area.

Much of the work on the statue was actually done at a foundry in Lander, Wyoming, with the pieces transported and assembled onsite. It weighs approximately 10 tons.

== Vision ==
LeQuire writes of his work:

Dance is the physical expression of music and the piece is intended to convey that feeling to the viewer in a composition which is simple, exuberant and celebratory. The theme of the sculpture is music, because of the historical and economic significance of the site. This is the heart of Music Row, the area and the artistic activity for which Nashville is best known. The sculpture conveys the importance of music to Nashville, past, present and future, and represents all forms of music without reference to any one form or style. It is meant to provide a visual icon for the area and for the city as a whole. The theme is music, but the sculpture represents artistic creativity itself. An artistic idea often seems to miraculously and spontaneously burst forth. This is what happens in the sculpture, and the title &quot;Musica&quot; suggests this since it refers to all the &#x27;arts of the muses.&#x27;

He also intended for the work to make a statement about Multiculturalism/diversity and racial harmony.

Just as I wanted all different kinds of music included, not just country, I always wanted it to be a reflection of our culture the way it is. ... this is a multicultural city with an amazing number of ethnicities in it.

Using live models, whose facial and bodily features he depicted, LeQuire created two Caucasian women and one Caucasian man; an African-American man and woman; one Asian-American woman; a Native American man; and a Hispanic man and woman.

== Funding ==
The $1.1-million project, funded by local arts patrons who gave on the condition of anonymity, is being offered as a gift to the city to highlight that very point. Such a permanent tribute, since approved by the Metropolitan Nashville Arts Commission and Metro Council, is what project backers sought originally when they approached LeQuire several years back. The artist is quoted as saying:

They wanted to do something lasting for that area, which is such a significant place in the history and future of Nashville. Plus, everyone felt that Music Row, as important as it has been, never had a sort of identifying feature. That was the whole reason for the roundabout itself, and those who created it always imagined a monument that went in the center.

== Controversy ==
The work was controversial due to its depiction of nudity, although according to LeQuire the work is entirely tasteful and not at all sexualized.

One television commentator, Larry Brinton, referred to the statue constantly as &quot;the naked statue&quot; after its unveiling. Others expressed even stronger disapproval. &quot;It seems quite hypocritical to me that, in a nation like ours, naked statues paid for by private money can be displayed on public land but a copy of the Ten Commandments paid for by private funds could not,&quot; said Jerry Sutton, former pastor of the Two Rivers Baptist Church in Nashville. Sutton and others called unsuccessfully for removal of the statue from public view.

Proponents of the statue were equally vehement in its defense. Columnist Gail Kerr of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s art. But naked art, predictably, has some people all upset. I&#x27;m not sure why really. We&#x27;ve already got naked statues.&quot; She urged bemused indifference to the current controversy. &quot;If you have such a peculiar fetish for bronze that fondling &quot;Musica&quot;&#x27;s tambourine will be simply irresistible, just steer clear of the roundabout. Otherwise, don&#x27;t get your toga in a wad.&quot;

On Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 2010, a local music group, the Willis Clan, and a group of friends, clothed the statues in oversized Celtic kilts and blouses they had made for the event, in what one local news source described as an &quot;epic&quot; prank. 2011 was the second year the ritual was performed. Unfortunately the wind that day was particularly violent; the statues had to be reclothed multiple times to keep from exposing anything explicit. The sculpture occasionally adorns other trinkets, such as T-shirts supporting the Nashville Predators during playoff runs, as well as runners&#x27; bibs during the Country Music Marathon.

<text>Aspergillus niger is a mold classified within the &quot;Nigri&quot; section of the &quot;Aspergillus&quot; genus. The &quot;Aspergillus&quot; genus consists of common molds found throughout the environment within soil and water, on vegetation, in fecal matter, on decomposing matter, and suspended in the air. Species within this genus often grow quickly and can sporulate within a few days of germination. A combination of characteristics unique to &quot;A. niger&quot; makes the microbe invaluable to the production of many acids, proteins and bioactive compounds. Characteristics including extensive metabolic diversity, high production yield, secretion capability, and the ability to conduct post-translational modifications are responsible for &quot;A. niger&#x27;s&quot; robust production of secondary metabolites. &quot;A. niger&#x27;s&quot; capability to withstand extremely acidic conditions makes it especially important to the industrial production of citric acid.

&quot;A. niger&quot; causes a disease known as &quot;black mold&quot; on certain fruits and vegetables such as grapes, apricots, onions, and peanuts, and is a common contaminant of food. It is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly found in indoor environments, where its black colonies can be confused with those of &quot;Stachybotrys&quot; (species of which have also been called &quot;black mold&quot;). &quot;A. niger&quot; is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in food production, although the microbe is capable of producing toxins that affect human health.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; is included in &quot;Aspergillus&quot; subgenus &quot;Circumdati&quot;, section &quot;Nigri&quot;. The section &quot;Nigri&quot; includes 15 related black-spored species that may be confused with &quot;A. niger&quot;, including &quot;A. tubingensis&quot;, &quot;A. foetidus&quot;, &quot;A. carbonarius&quot;, and &quot;A. awamori&quot;. In 2004, a number of morphologically similar species were described by Samson &quot;et al.&quot;

In 2007, the strain of ATCC 16404 &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; was reclassified as &quot;Aspergillus brasiliensis&quot; (refer to publication by Varga et al.). This required an update to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia and the European Pharmacopoeia, which commonly use this strain throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

==Cultivation==
&quot;A. niger&quot; is a strict aerobe; therefore, it requires oxygen to grow. The fungus can grow in a range of environmental conditions; it can grow at temperatures ranging from 6 to 47 °C. As a mesophile, its optimal temperature range is 35-37 °C. It can tolerate pH ranging from 1.5 to 9.8. &quot;A. niger&quot; is xerophilic, meaning it can grow and reproduce in environments with very little water. It can also grow in humid conditions even tolerating environments with 90-100% relative humidity. The fungus is most commonly grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA), but it can grow on many different types of growth media including Czapek-Dox agar, lignocellulose agar, and several others. 

== Genome ==
&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; has a genome consisting of roughly 34 megabases (Mb) organized into eight chromosomes. The DNA contains 10,785 genes which are transcribed and translated into 10,593 proteins.
Two strains of &quot;A. niger&quot; have been sequenced. Strain CBS 513.88 produces enzymes used in industrial applications while strain ATCC 1015 is the wildtype strain of ATCC 11414 used to produce industrial citric acid (CA). The &quot;A. niger&quot; ATCC 1015 genome was sequenced by the Joint Genome Institute in a collaboration with other institutions. Completed sequences have been used to uncover orthologous genes and pathways involved in fungal metabolism, specifically the catabolism of monosaccharides. The ability of &quot;A. niger&quot; to change its metabolism depending on the carbon sources and other nutrients present in its environment has enabled the microorganism to survive and be found in almost all ecosystems. Further research is being done to study these mechanisms for all fungi using the complete sequenced genome of &quot;A. niger&quot;.

== Industrial uses ==
There are two ways in which &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; can be grown for industrial purposes: solid state fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF). SSF uses a solid substrate with nutrients and minimal moisture to grow microorganisms. Nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon come from agricultural byproducts such as wheat bran, sugar pulp, rice husks, and corn flour. SSF gives better yield of microbe products and is more cost effective than SmF due to using agricultural byproducts. SSF is predominantly used over SmF. In SmF, microbes are grown in a liquid medium inside large aseptic fermentation vessels. These vessels are expensive pieces of equipment that provide more water for growth and allow for tight control of environmental factors, such as temperature and pH, that affects microbial growth.

&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; is cultured to facilitate the industrial production of many substances. Various strains of &quot;A. niger&quot; are used in the industrial preparation of citric acid (E330) and gluconic acid (E574); therefore, they have been deemed acceptable for daily intake by the World Health Organization. &quot;A. niger&quot; fermentation is &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot; (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. &quot;A. niger&quot; is also being considered as a potential new source of natural food grade pigments.

The production of citric acid (CA) is achieved by growing strains of &quot;A. niger&quot; in a nutrient rich medium that includes high concentrations of sugar and mineral salts and an acidic pH of 2.5-3.5. Many microorganisms produce CA, but &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; produces more than 1 million metric tons of CA annually via a fungal fermentation process. CA is in high demand for applications such as the control of microorganism growth, food and beverage flavor enhancement, acidity manipulation, pharmaceuticals, etc.

&quot;A. niger&quot; produces many useful enzymes for the catabolism of biopolymers in order to obtain nutrients from its environment. The production of specific enzymes can be increased for industrial purposes. For example, &quot;A. niger&quot; glucoamylase () is used in the production of high-fructose corn syrup and pectinases (GH28) are used in cider and wine clarification. Alpha-galactosidase (GH27), an enzyme that breaks down certain complex sugars, is a component of Beano and several other products that decrease flatulence. Another use for &quot;A. niger&quot; within the biotechnology industry is in the production of magnetic isotope-containing variants of biological macromolecules for NMR analysis. &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; is also cultured for the extraction of the enzyme, glucose oxidase (), used in the design of glucose biosensors, due to its high affinity for β-D-glucose.

In the food industry, &quot;A. niger&quot; is also cultured to isolate the enzyme fructosyltransferase to produce fructooligosaccharides (FOS). FOS are used to manufacture low-calorie and functional foods due to FOS characteristic ability to slow growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the intestines. These foods have prebiotic fiber among other health promoting properties. &quot;A. niger&quot; is not the only organism to produce the enzyme fructosyltransferase, but it has been found to produce the enzyme at rates conducive to industrial production. A specific use of A. niger within the food industry is its capability to produce enzymes like carbohydrase and cellulase, which are commonly used in the seafood industry for removing the bellies of clams during processing and removing the tough external skin of shrimp from their edible internal tissue.

&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; can grow in gold-mining solutions containing cyano-metal complexes with gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy-metal sulfides. &quot;A. niger&quot; has also been shown to remediate acid mine drainage through biosorption of copper and manganese.

== Toxicity ==
&quot;A. niger&quot; produces a wide variety of secondary metabolites, some of which are mycotoxins called ochratoxins, such as ochratoxin A. Contamination by filamentous fungi, such as &quot;A. niger,&quot; occurs frequently in grapes and grape based products resulting in contamination by ochratoxin A (OTA). OTA, a clinically relevant mycotoxin, can accumulate in human tissue and cause a variety of serious health conditions. Potential consequences of OTA poisoning include kidney damage, kidney failure and cancer but the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not set maximum permissible levels of OTA in food unlike the EU that set maximum permissible levels in a variety of food products.

== Pathogenicity ==
=== Plant pathogen ===
&quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; can cause black mold infections in certain legumes, fruits, and vegetables such as peanuts, grapes, and onions, leading to the fungus being a common food contaminant. This filamentous ascomycete has a tolerance to changes in pH, humidity, and heat, thriving in a temperature range from . These characteristics make infections of &quot;A. niger&quot; a common cause of post-harvest decay in fruits and vegetables, which can lead to significant economic loss in the food industry. &quot;A. niger&quot; infection in plants can cause a reduction in seed germination, seedling emergence, root elongation, and shoot elongation, causing the plant to perish before maturation. Specifically, &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; causes sooty mold on onions and ornamental plants.

=== Human pathogen ===
&quot;A. niger&quot; is pathogenic. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by spores of indoor and outdoor &quot;Aspergillus&quot; mold species. Due to the ubiquitous nature of &quot;A. niger&quot;, its spores are commonly inhaled by humans from their surrounding environment. Aspergillosis infection customarily occurs in people with compromised immune systems or pre-existing lung conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis. Types of aspergillosis include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), allergic aspergillus sinusitis, azole-resistant aspergillus fumigatus, cutaneous (skin) aspergillosis, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Out of the approximated 180 species of &quot;aspergillus&quot; molds, roughly 40 species have been found to cause health concern in immunocompromised humans. Aspergillosis is particularly frequent among horticultural workers who often inhale peat dust, which can be rich in &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; spores. The fungus has also been found in ancient Egyptian mummies and can be inhaled when they are disturbed. Otomycosis, which is a superficial fungal infection of the ear canal, is another disorder that can be caused by overgrowth of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; molds like &quot;A. niger.&quot; Otomycosis caused by &quot;A. niger&quot; is frequently associated with mechanical damage of the ear canal&#x27;s external skin barrier and often presents itself in patients living in tropical climates&quot;.&quot; &quot;A. niger&quot; is rarely reported to cause pneumonia compared to other &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species, such as &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, and &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;.

<doc id="312440" wikidata="Q457453" url="?curid=312440" title="Villa Tugendhat">
<text>Villa Tugendhat () is an architecturally significant building in Brno, Czech Republic. It is one of the pioneering prototypes of modern architecture in Europe, and was designed by the German architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich. It was built between 1928 and 1930 for Fritz Tugendhat and his wife Greta, of the wealthy and influential Jewish Czech Tugendhat family. Of reinforced concrete, the villa soon became an icon of modernism. Famous for its revolutionary use of space and industrial building materials, the building was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001.

==Design==
The free-standing three-story villa is on a slope and faces the south-west. The second story (the ground floor) consists of the main living and social areas with the conservatory, the terrace, the kitchen and servants&#x27; rooms. The third story (the first floor) has the main entrance from the street with a passage to the terrace, the entrance hall, and rooms for the parents, children and the nanny with appropriate facilities. The chauffeur&#x27;s flat with the garages and the terrace are accessed separately.

Mies&#x27; design principle of &quot;less is more&quot; and emphasis on functional amenities created a fine example of early functionalist architecture, a groundbreaking new vision in building design at the time. Mies used a revolutionary iron framework, which enabled him to dispense with supporting walls and arrange the interior in order to achieve a feeling of space and light. One wall is a sliding sheet of plate glass that descends to the basement the way an automobile window does. Mies specified all the furnishings, in collaboration with interior designer Lilly Reich (two armchairs designed for the building, the Tugendhat chair and the Brno chair, are still in production). There were no paintings or decorative items in the villa, but the interior was by no means austere due to the use of naturally patterned materials such as the onyx wall and rare tropical woods. The onyx wall is partially translucent and changes appearance when the evening sun is low. The architect managed to make the magnificent view from the villa an integral part of the interior.

The cost was very high due to the unusual construction method, luxurious materials, and the use of modern technology for heating and ventilation. The lower-ground level was used as a service area. An ultra-modern air-conditioning system was here and a glass façade that opens completely assisted by a mechanism built into the wall. The floor area was unusually large and open compared to the average family home of the period, which, in addition to the various storage rooms, made the structure unique if not confusing to visitors not used to such minimalism.

===Features===

The main living area features a dividing wall of brown-gold onyx, which Mies sourced from the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. He supervised the cutting and finishing himself.

Unusually for the time, the building features air conditioning.

In the basement there are a series of dedicated service rooms, including a mechanism to retract the windows and the &quot;Mottenkammer&quot;, a dedicated moth-resistant storage room for keeping fur coats.

==History==
The villa was commissioned by the German Jewish Fritz and Greta Tugendhat. The construction company of Artur and Moritz Eisler began construction in the summer of 1929 and finished it in 14 months.

Fritz and Greta Tugendhat lived in the villa for just eight years before the Nazi&#x27;s persecution of and genocide of the Jewish people forced the family to flee Czechoslovakia for their lives with their children in 1938 (including philosopher Ernst Tugendhat), shortly before the country was dismembered following the Munich Agreement with the Nazis.

The family moved to Switzerland and then had to flee again to Venezuela; after the Holocaust they returned to Switzerland, but never were able to live in the villa again.

===During World War II===
The villa was confiscated by the Gestapo in 1939 and used as an apartment and office; its interior was modified and many pieces disappeared.

In 1942 the house was rented out as offices of the Nazi Messerschmitt aeroplane works. Willy Messerschmitt had his own apartment in the villa.

In April 1945, Brno was liberated by the Red Army and a Soviet unit quartered in the villa, doing considerable damage to the building&#x27;s white linoleum floor. The often reported information that the villa was also used as a stable is unlikely, as the entrance door from the garden is too small. What furniture remained in the villa was used for firewood.

===Post-war restoration and opening to the public===
In the post-war years, the building was partially repaired and used for various purposes (for example as a children&#x27;s physiotherapy centre) for several decades after World War II.

Greta Tugendhat returned to the villa in 1967 with Dirk Lohan a senior architect from Mies&#x27;s Chicago studio (and his grandson) and explained the original design to him, and a group of Czech architects set out to repair it. It was inscribed on the National List of Cultural Heritage in 1969 and restored after 1980. On 26 August 1992, Václav Klaus and Vladimír Mečiar, the political leaders of Czechoslovakia, met there to sign the document that divided the country into the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. Since 1994 the villa has been open to the public as a museum administered by the city of Brno.

In 1993 the Villa Tugendhat Fund and Friends of Tugendhat were formed to preserve the villa. In 1995 Brno received a $15,000 grant to pay for preliminary research from the Samuel H. Kress European Preservation Program, part of the World Monuments Fund. The International Music and Art Foundation, based in Liechtenstein, pledged $100,000, because a trustee, Nicholas Thaw, was also a trustee of the World Monuments Fund. The Robert Wilson Foundation matched the $100,000.

In 2007 Daniela Hammer-Tugendhat applied for the restitution of the villa, citing a law covering works of art confiscated during the Holocaust. The reason for this application appears to have been their frustration over the failure of the municipality of Brno to carry out vital restoration work due to the deterioration of the concrete used in construction. Entire sections of the interior were missing. Later, parts of the original wood panelling were found at Masaryk University, a building used by the Gestapo as their Brno headquarters.

Reconstruction and restoration started in February 2010 with estimated costs of 150 million CZK (approximately EUR 5,769,000; US$7,895,000). This reconstruction finished in February 2012 and the villa was reopened to the public in March. To celebrate the villa&#x27;s restoration, the Royal Institute of British Architects launched &#x27;Villa Tugendhat in Context&#x27;, an exhibition in London giving a visual history and a record of the recent renovation through the testimony of three generations of photographers.

Near Villa Tugendhat is Greta&#x27;s family home, the Art Nouveau Löw-Beer Villa (now a branch of the Museum of the Brno Region), which will present an exhibition &quot;The World of the Brno Bourgeoisie around the Löw-Beers and Tugendhat&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The villa was a principal location in the 2007 film &quot;Hannibal Rising&quot;, serving as the villa of the villain, Vladis Gutas. Simon Mawer&#x27;s 2009 Booker Prize-shortlisted novel, &quot;The Glass Room&quot;, is a fictional account of a house inspired by the villa. A film based in part on the novel, &quot;The Affair&quot;, was shot at the villa and released in 2019.

<text>Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Kreisler (February 2, 1875 – January 29, 1962) was an Austrian-born American violinist and composer. One of the most noted violin masters of his day, he was known for his sweet tone and expressive phrasing, with marked portamento and rubato. Like many great violinists of his generation, he produced a characteristic sound which was immediately recognizable as his own. Although it derived in many respects from the Franco-Belgian school, his style is nonetheless reminiscent of the &quot;gemütlich&quot; (cozy) lifestyle of pre-war Vienna.

== Biography ==

Kreisler was born in Vienna, the son of Anna (née Reches) and Samuel Kreisler, a doctor. Of Jewish descent, he was however baptised at the age of 12. He studied at the Vienna Conservatory between 1882 and 1885 under Anton Bruckner, Jakob Dont and Joseph Hellmesberger Jr., and in Paris Conservatory between 1885 and 1887, where his teachers included Léo Delibes, Lambert Massart and Jules Massenet. He graduated from Paris Conservatory with a degree of &quot;Premier Prix&quot; gold medal at the age of 12, competing against 40 other players, all of whom were at least 20 years of age.

He made his United States debut at the Steinway Hall in New York City on November 10, 1888, and his first tour of the United States in 1888–1889 with Moriz Rosenthal. He then returned to Austria and applied for a position in the Vienna Philharmonic, but was turned down by the concertmaster Arnold Rosé. As a result, he left music to study medicine. He spent a brief time in the army before returning to the violin in 1899, when he gave a concert with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Arthur Nikisch. It was this concert and a series of American tours from 1901 to 1903 that brought him real acclaim. Kreisler was also an excellent pianist, and his piano playing is preserved on Ampico reproducing piano rolls.

During a concert tour of the United States in 1901, Kreisler met Harriet Lies, a New York-born divorcée who was a Vassar graduate and the daughter of a German American tobacco merchant. They fell in love immediately and were married a year later, though they repeated the ceremony three more times because of legal technicalities. They had no children, and Harriet devoted her life to his career. They were married for 60 years, until his death in 1962.

In 1910, Kreisler gave the premiere of Sir Edward Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto, a work commissioned by and dedicated to him. He served briefly in the Austrian Army in World War I before being honourably discharged after he was wounded. He arrived in New York on November 24, 1914, and spent the remainder of the war in America. He returned to Europe in 1924, living first in Berlin, then moving to France in 1938. Shortly thereafter, at the outbreak of World War II, he settled once again in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1943. He lived there for the rest of his life, giving his last public concert in 1947, and broadcasting performances for a few years after that.

On April 26, 1941, he was involved in a serious traffic accident. Struck by a truck while crossing a street in New York, he suffered a fractured skull and was in a coma for over a week.

In his later years, he suffered from not only some hearing loss but also sight deterioration due to cataracts.

Kreisler died of a heart condition aggravated by old age in New York City in 1962. He was interred in a private mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery, the Bronx, New York City.

== Legacy ==
Kreisler wrote a number of pieces for the violin, including solos for encores, such as &quot;Liebesleid&quot; and &quot;Liebesfreud&quot;. Some of Kreisler&#x27;s compositions were pastiches ostensibly in the style of other composers. They were originally ascribed to earlier composers, such as Gaetano Pugnani, Giuseppe Tartini and Antonio Vivaldi, and then, in 1935, Kreisler revealed that it was he who wrote the pieces. When critics complained, Kreisler replied that they had already deemed the compositions worthy: &quot;The name changes, the value remains&quot;, he said. He also wrote operettas, including &quot;Apple Blossoms&quot; in 1919 and &quot;&quot; in 1932, a string quartet, and cadenzas, including ones for Brahms&#x27;s Violin Concerto, Paganini&#x27;s D major Violin Concerto, and Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto. His cadenzas for the Beethoven concerto are the ones most often played by violinists today.

He wrote the music for the 1936 movie &quot;The King Steps Out&quot; directed by Josef von Sternberg, based on the early years of Empress Elisabeth of Austria.

Kreisler performed and recorded his own version of the first movement of Paganini&#x27;s D major Violin Concerto. The movement is rescored and in some places reharmonised, and the orchestral introduction is completely rewritten in some places. The overall effect is of a late-nineteenth-century work.

Kreisler owned several antique violins made by luthiers Antonio Stradivari, Pietro Guarneri, Giuseppe Guarneri, and Carlo Bergonzi, most of which eventually came to bear his name. He also owned a Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume violin of 1860, which he often used as his second violin, and which he often loaned to the young prodigy Josef Hassid. In 1952 he donated his Giuseppe Guarneri to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. where it remains in use for performances given in the library.

On recordings, Kreisler&#x27;s style resembles that of his younger contemporary Mischa Elman, with a tendency toward expansive tempi, a continuous and varied vibrato, expressive phrasing, and a melodic approach to passage-work. Kreisler makes considerable use of portamento and rubato. The two violinists&#x27; approaches are less similar in big works of the standard repertoire, such as Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto, than in smaller pieces.

A trip to a Kreisler concert is recounted in Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s 1928 autobiographical novel &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;.

The Australian manufacturer of electronics and consumer goods Kriesler (later a subsidiary of Philips) supposedly took its name after Fritz Kreisler but had intentionally misspelled the name as to avoid possible juristical actions from other parties.

<text>The baccalauréat (; ), often known in France colloquially as the bac, is a French national academic qualification that students can obtain at the completion of their secondary education (at the end of the &quot;lycée&quot;) by meeting certain requirements. Though it has only existed in its present form as a school-leaving examination since Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s implementation on March 17, 1808, its origins date back to the first medieval French universities. According to French law, the baccalaureate is the first academic degree, though it grants the completion of secondary education. Historically, the baccalaureate is administratively supervised by full professors at universities. 

Similar academic qualifications exist elsewhere in Europe, variously known as &quot;Abitur&quot; in Germany, &quot;maturità&quot; in Italy, &quot;bachillerato&quot; in Spain, &quot;maturita&quot; in Slovakia and Czech Republic. There is also the European Baccalaureate, which students take at the end of the European School education.

In France, there are three main types of &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, which are very different and obtained in different places: the (general baccalaureate), the (technological baccalaureate), and the (professional baccalaureate).

==Overview==
Much like the European &quot;Matura&quot; or English A levels, the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18 (end of the &quot;lycée&quot;). It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to tertiary education (&quot;universités&quot;), or acquire some other professional qualification or training. Even though it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam.

The word &quot;bac&quot; is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their &quot;baccalauréat&quot; diploma: the &quot;bac de philo&quot;, for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study.

Within France, there are three main types of &quot;baccalauréat&quot; obtained in different places, and which are completely different:

*the (general baccalaureate), specially made to enter university and continue studies;
*the (technological baccalaureate), specially made to work or continue short technical studies;
*the (professional baccalaureate), specially made to enter professional life.

For entrance to regular universities within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of &quot;baccalauréat&quot; that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the &quot;bac&quot; by taking a special exam, the &quot;diploma for entrance to higher education&quot;.

Though most students take the &quot;bac&quot; at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a &quot;candidat libre&quot; (literally, &quot;free candidate&quot;) without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the &quot;bac&quot; upon completion of secondary school (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the &quot;bac&quot; would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option.

==&quot;Baccalauréat général&quot; (Pre-2019 reform)==
The main purpose of the general baccalaureate is to access universities and &quot;grandes écoles&quot; to pursue higher academic education. It attests to an advanced level in general skills. It is obtained in a &quot;Lycée général&quot;.

Before 2019, students who would sit for the chose one of three streams (termed &quot;séries&quot;) in their penultimate &quot;lycée&quot; year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). Each stream assigned different weights (&quot;coefficients&quot;) to each subject and resulted in a specialization.

The streams of the before 2021 were as follows:
Another terminology is sometimes used that pertains to the curriculum before 1994, which further divided two of the &quot;séries&quot;. Until then, it was possible to sit for a &quot;bac C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; (which comprise the current S), a &quot;bac B&quot; (currently ES), or a &quot;bac&quot; &quot;A1&quot;, &quot;A2&quot; or &quot;A3&quot; (which comprise the current L). People who passed the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma.

The &quot;baccalauréat&quot; permits students to sit exams in over forty languages, including French regional languages such as Alsatian, Breton, Catalan or Norman.

=== &quot;Baccalauréat général : série&quot; &quot;Littéraire&quot; (L) ===
Students in the L stream prepare for careers in education, linguistics, literature, philosophy, public service, politics, sociology, management, business administration, law, and economics. They also have interests in the arts. The most important subjects in the literary stream are Philosophy, French language, Literature, Arts and other Languages, usually English, German and Spanish.

=== &quot;Baccalauréat général : série&quot; &quot;Scientifique&quot; (S) ===
The S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as medicine, engineering and the natural sciences. Science students must specialise in Mathematics, Physics &amp; Chemistry, Computer Science or Earth &amp; Life Sciences. Students in this stream must generally have a good result in Physics &amp; Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth &amp; Life Sciences and, if available, Engineering Sciences and Computer Science.

=== &quot;Baccalauréat général : série&quot; &quot;Économique et&quot; &quot;Sociale&quot; (ES) ===
Students of the ES stream prepare for careers in politics, sociology, management, business administration, law, and economics. The main and important subjects of this stream are Economics &amp; Social Sciences, History &amp; Geography, and Mathematics.

== &quot;Baccalauréat général&quot; (post-2019) ==
From 2019, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate have been replaced by three specialty streams, taken during the penultimate year (Première), only two of which are kept in the final year (Terminale). There are 12 subjects specific to the three &quot;spécialités&quot; (majors, litt. &quot;specialities&quot;) : arts, ecology, history, geography &amp; geopolitics, humanities, languages, literature, mathematics, computer science, physics &amp; chemistry, economic &amp; social sciences, engineering sciences, and biology &amp; geology. These subjects are added to a set common to all : French, philosophy, history &amp; geography, languages, sciences and sport. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final oral test.
==&quot;Baccalauréat technologique&quot;==
The technological baccalaureate is one of the three tracks of the French baccalaureate. It is obtained in a &quot;Lycée technologique&quot;. The teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows the student to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant management, etc.).

It currently has eight sections : STMG (Sciences and Technologies of Management), ST2S (Sciences and Technologies of Healthcare), STI2D (Sciences and Technologies of Industry and Sustainable Development), STD2A (Sciences and Technologies of Design and Applied Art), STHR (Hospitality Industry and Business), STL (Science and Technologies of Laboratory), STAV (Science and Technologies of Agronomy and Living Organisms), S2TMD (Science and Technologies of Theatre, Music and Dance).

== &quot;Baccalauréat professionnel&quot; ==
The professional baccalaureate allows rapid integration into working life. It is obtained in a &quot;Lycée professionnel&quot;.

The professional baccalaureate includes nearly 100 specialties like : leather crafts; building technician; maintenance of industrial equipment; cook; road freight transport driver; butcher; etc.

==Format==
The examination takes place in the two last years of the &quot;lycée&quot;: &quot;première&quot; and &quot;terminale&quot;. From 2021 a large part of the tests is now in continuous control.

Most examinations are given in essay form. The student is given a substantial block of time (depending on the exam, that is from two to five hours) to complete a multiple-page, well-argued paper. The number of pages varies from exam to exam but is usually substantial considering all answers have to be written down, explained and justified. Mathematics and science exams are problem sets but some science questions also require an essay-type answer. Foreign-language exams often have a short translation section as well. The Mathematics and Earth &amp; Life Sciences examinations may occasionally contain some multiple-choice questions (&quot;choix multiples&quot;), but this is rare and, when it occurs, does not constitute the majority of the exam.

Students of the also have to work on an oral research project (&quot;travaux personnels encadrés&quot; or TPE). It focuses on their specialties, under the supervision of a faculty member. The oral examination takes place in front of a jury of teachers. There are also several oral exams in languages; practical work in science or arts; or physical evaluation in sport.

When taken in mainland France, the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; material is the same for all students in a given stream. The secrecy surrounding the material is very tight, and the envelopes containing the exams are unsealed by a high-ranking school officer (usually a principal or vice-principal) in front of the examinees only a few minutes prior to the start of the examination. The procedure is the same for each subject, in each stream. Students usually have an identification number and an assigned seat. The number is written on all exam material and the name is hidden by folding and sealing the upper right-hand corner of the examination sheet(s). That way, anonymity is respected. The papers are usually marked by a member of the teaching staff in the same district or, at a larger scale, in the same &quot;académie&quot;. To avoid conflicts of interest, a teacher who has lectured to a student or group of students cannot grade that exam. Also, to ensure greater objectivity on the part of the examiners, the test is anonymous. The grader sees only an exam paper with a serial number, with all personally identifying material stripped away and forbidden from appearing, thus curbing any favoritism based upon sex, religion, national origin, or ethnicity.

Unlike the English GCSEs, Scottish Standard Grades and the American SAT, the French &quot;baccalauréat&quot; is not a completely standardised test. Since most answers, even for biology questions, are given in essay form, the grades may vary from grader to grader, especially in subjects like philosophy and French literature.

Students generally take the French Language &amp; Literature exam at the end of &quot;première&quot; since that subject is not taught in &quot;terminale&quot;, where it is replaced with Philosophy. It also has an oral examination component, along with the written part. The oral exam covers works studied throughout &quot;première&quot;. However, in L, students do have a literature exam in &quot;terminale&quot;.

===Weighting system===
Each &quot;baccalauréat&quot; stream has its own set of subjects that each carry a different weighting (&quot;coefficient&quot;). That allows some subjects to be more important than others. For example, in the ES stream, Economics &amp; Social Sciences carries more weight than the natural sciences and so the former is more important than the latter. Students usually study more for exams that carry heavier weightings since the grades that they obtain in these exams have a bigger impact on their overall grade. Whether or not one passes the &quot;bac&quot; and/or receives eventual honours is determined by the calculation of that overall grade.

=== &quot;Le baccalauréat français international&quot; ===
The general baccalaureate offers several additional variants. The best-known subset is the &quot;baccalauréat français international&quot; (named &quot;option internationale du baccalauréat&quot;, OIB, until 2022). Sometimes translated as the &quot;French international baccalaureate&quot;, it is unrelated to the International Baccalaureate (IB).

The OIB adds additional subjects to the French national exam. Students choose one of the L, ES or S streams. It differs, as students take a two-year syllabus in literature, history, and geography in a foreign language. That syllabus and the way that it is examined is modelled on the national exam of the target nation. For instance, the British Section (administered by the University of Cambridge) models the programmes on A-levels in English, History, and Geography. It is therefore necessary to be fully bilingual to complete this qualification. To date there are 16 different sections supporting 14 different languages: American, Arabic, British, (mainland) Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Brazilian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.

At the end of &quot;terminale&quot;, OIB students have extra exams in Literature and History/Geography, with a written and oral component to both exams, and since 2024 an oral on a free project linked to the country of the section, known as &quot;Connaissance du monde&quot;. These exams have a high weighting in the final mark of the baccalaureate and do not give extra points to OIB students. Overall, these students work more (up to an additional 10 hours per week of classes, with a significant amount of required reading and homework attached as well) than the other general baccalaureate students, and many of them tend to go to foreign universities. University admissions tutors often consider reducing the entrance requirements for students taking the OIB compared with those taking the standard French baccalaureate to reflect the additional demands of the OIB.

Since the students that attend these schools make up a fairly small demographic, they tend to be spread over a far larger area than would traditionally be expected of a normal &quot;lycée&quot; or secondary school. As a consequence, many of these students must commute long distances, with one-hour trips each way being fairly common. The long commutes, longer days, and increased workload that come with the OIB place great demands on students; many cannot handle the workload and transfer to schools offering the standard French baccalaureate. Thus, many consider the OIB qualification to be highly challenging and a sign, not only of academic prowess, but also of tenacity and hard work.

=== Different languages ===

To test their foreign or regional language students can choose among these different languages (though not at all schools): the foreign languages English, German, Arabic, Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, Modern Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Vietnamese; and the regional languages Basque, Breton, Catalan, Corsican, Auvergnat, Gascon, Languedoc, Limousin, Niçard, Provençal, Vivaro-Alpine, regional languages of Alsace, regional languages of Moselle, Tahitian, Albanian, Amharic, Melanesian languages, Bambara, Berber, Bulgarian, Cambodian, Korean, Croatian, Hausa, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Laotian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malagasy, Persian, Fulani, Romanian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, Swahili, Tamil, Czech.

=== Reforms ===
In 2021, the general baccalaureate underwent a reformation. Since November 2017, an initiative spearheaded by minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has united numerous actors from the field of education to reinvent this system to have less exams (now only four) in conjunction with a large oral examination. The old streams (S, ES and L) equally disappeared and, rather than being entirely decided by final examinations, 40% of the student&#x27;s final grade will consist of demonstrated success over the course of the school year.  

==Passing and honours==
The pass mark is 10 out of 20. The 2014 success rate for the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; in mainland France was 87.9%.

For the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, four levels of honours are given:
*A mark between 12 and 13.99 will earn a &quot;mention assez bien&quot; (honours, lit. &quot;fairly good&quot;);
*A mark between 14 and 15.99 will earn a &quot;mention bien&quot; (high honours, lit. &quot;good&quot;);
*A mark between 16 and 17.99 will earn a &quot;mention très bien&quot; (very high honours, lit. &quot;very good&quot;);
*A mark of 18 and above will earn the &quot;félicitations du jury&quot; (highest honors, lit. “congratulations from the [examination] jury”).

Honours are prestigious but not crucial, as admissions to the &quot;classes préparatoires&quot; (preparatory classes), which prepare students for the grande école examinations, are decided months before the examination.

French educators seldom use the entire grading scale. The same applies when marking the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. Therefore, students are very unlikely to get a 20 out of 20 or more (it is actually possible to get more than 20 because of options like Arts, Music, Latin, etc.). It is also very rare to see scores lower than 5.

Grade inflation has become a concern. Between 2005 and 2016 the proportion of students receiving at least an honor in the general baccalauréat increased by 65%.

===European section===
A European section is an option in French high schools to teach a subject through a European language other than French. It also gives pupils the opportunity of having more hours in the language studied. It is also an opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country of which the language is being spoken. For example, if learning History in Spanish, the history of Spain and that of Central and South America would be emphasized. Teachers present their lessons in English, German, Italian or Spanish.

At the end, students can receive a &quot;European section&quot; mention on their &quot;baccalaureat&quot;. To have that mention, they need to get at least 12/20 on their language examination and at least 10/20 at an additional oral examination on the subject in the language.

For example, those who choose History in Spanish as an additional subject would take their Spanish examination like the rest of their classmates, who do not have History in Spanish, and get at least 12/20. They then have to pass an oral examination on history in Spanish and get at least 10/20.

===Supplemental examination===
A student who averages between 8 and 10 is permitted to sit for the &quot;épreuve de rattrapage&quot; (also called the &quot;second groupe&quot;), a supplemental oral examination is given in two subjects of the student&#x27;s choice. A student who does well enough in those examinations to raise the overall weighted grade to a 10 gets the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;. A student who does poorly in the orals and receives below a 10 may choose to repeat the final year of lycée (&quot;terminale&quot;).

Students may not redo the entire examination in September; the September examinations may be taken only by those who have not been able to take the June examinations for serious reasons (such as illness).

==Note==
# The formula was taken from the Lycée Claudel website, a French &quot;lycée&quot; in Ottawa, Canada, and might only be accurate for Canadian—or even Ontarian—percentage grades. In Ontario, an 80% grade is an &quot;A&quot; on the American Scale and the student is awarded an Ontario Scholar Diploma. A 90% grade is an A+ on the American Scale, is considered a grade with honours, and automatically qualifies the student for government-funded scholarships and bursaries. The formula should be used for comparison only.

<text>A store of value is any commodity or asset that would normally retain purchasing power into the future and is the function of the asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved.

The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset.

==Money as a store of value==

Monetary economics is the branch of economics which analyses the functions of money. Storage of value is one of the three generally accepted functions of money. The other functions are the medium of exchange, which is used as an intermediary to avoid the inconveniences of the coincidence of wants, and the unit of account, which allows the value of various goods, services, assets and liabilities to be rendered in multiples of the same unit. Money is well-suited to storing value because of its purchasing power. It is also useful because of its durability.

Because of its function as a store of value, large quantities of money are hoarded. Money&#x27;s usefulness as a store of value declines if there are significant changes in the general level of prices. So if inflation rises, purchasing power declines and a cost is placed on those holding money.

Workers who are paid in a currency which is experiencing high-inflation will prefer to spend their income quickly instead of saving it. When a currency loses its store of value, or more accurately when a currency is perceived to lose its future purchasing power, it fails to function as money. This causes people to use currencies from other countries as a substitute.

According to the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which is represented by the Cambridge equation, money&#x27;s ability to store value is more important than its function as a medium of exchange. Cambridge claims that the demand for money is derived from its ability to store value. This is contrary to Fisher economists&#x27; belief that demand arises because money is needed for exchange.

==Other stores of value==

The term cash is often used to indicate both currency, which is usually represented by paper money or coins in industrialized countries, and sums deposited and payable almost immediately on order.

Apart from cash, legal tender issued on the &quot;fiat&quot; of a sovereign government, examples of assets used as potential stores of value are:

* Financial assets, e.g. stocks, bonds and other fixed income investments, investment funds, private equity
* Real estate, e.g. home-ownership, rental property, or through financial securities or fractional ownership
* Commodities (especially through financial assets), such as natural gas or soybean
* Physical gold or other precious metals, such as gold coins, platinum or silver bullions
* Collectibles or artworks, e.g. gemstones, antiques, coins, paintings, wines

In addition, currency can take many alternative forms, such as cryptocurrency, livestock (e.g. some pre-colonial African currencies), labor vouchers, gift economy relationships or stored-value cards (value is recorded directly on computer chips of the cards).

While the above-mentioned assets may be inconvenient to trade daily or store, and may vary in value quite significantly, they are expected to rarely lose all value. It need not be a capital asset at all, merely have economic value that is not believed to disappear even in the worst situation.

The disadvantage for land, houses and property as a store for value is that it may take time to find a buyer for those assets. 

As stores of value, gold and precious metals are generally favored to industrial commodities, because of their demand and rarity in nature, which reduces the risk of devaluation associated with increased production and supply.

Cryptocurrency&#x27;s role as a store of value is currently a matter of debate. The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance on &quot;virtual currencies&quot; that refers to them as &quot;a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value.&quot; The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is often compared by advocates to gold. In their role as a store of value, cryptocurrencies often elicit concern, due to their extreme volatility, or due to concerns about the emergence of regulation and contradictory handling by governments. Note that the Bitcoin blockchain ledger is unalterable and that Bitcoin cannot be taken from someone, except by force, known as the &#x27;five-dollar wrench attack&#x27;.

<doc id="312451" wikidata="Q207773" url="?curid=312451" title="Howard Shore">
<text>Howard Leslie Shore (born October 18, 1946) is a Canadian composer, conductor and orchestrator noted for his film scores. He has composed the scores for over 80 films, most notably the scores for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film trilogies. He won three Academy Awards for his work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with one being for the song &quot;Into the West&quot;, an award he shared with Eurythmics lead vocalist Annie Lennox and writer/producer Fran Walsh, who wrote the lyrics. He is a consistent collaborator with director David Cronenberg, having scored all but one of his films since 1979, and collaborated with Martin Scorsese on six of his films.

Shore has also composed concert works including one opera, &quot;The Fly&quot;, based on the plot of Cronenberg&#x27;s 1986 film, which premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on July 2, 2008; a short piece named &quot;Fanfare for the Wanamaker Organ and the Philadelphia Orchestra&quot;; and a short overture for the Swiss 21st Century Symphony Orchestra. Shore has also composed for television, including serving as the original musical director for the American sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1975 to 1980.

In addition to his three Oscars, Shore has also won three Golden Globe Awards, four Grammy Awards, three Genie Awards, and nine Canadian Screen Awards.

==Early life and career==
Shore was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Jewish parents Bernice (née Ash) and Mac Shore. He started studying music around the age of 8 or 9. He learned a multitude of instruments and began playing in bands at the ages of 13 and 14. When Shore was 13, he met and became good friends with a young Lorne Michaels in summer camp, and this friendship would later be influential in his career. By 17, he decided he wanted to pursue music in his adult life too. He studied music at Berklee College of Music in Boston after graduating from Forest Hill Collegiate Institute.

From 1969 to 1972, Shore was a member of the jazz fusion band Lighthouse. In 1970, he became the music director for Lorne Michaels and Hart Pomerantz&#x27;s short-lived TV program &quot;The Hart &amp; Lorne Terrific Hour&quot;. Shore wrote the music for Canadian magician Doug Henning&#x27;s magic musical &quot;Spellbound&quot; in 1974 and, from 1975 to 1980, he was the musical director for Michaels&#x27; influential late-night NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, appearing in many musical sketches, including Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band, and dressed as a beekeeper for a Dan Aykroyd/John Belushi performance of the Slim Harpo classic &quot;I&#x27;m a King Bee&quot;. Shore also suggested the name for the Blues Brothers to Aykroyd and Belushi.

==Film scoring==

===1978–2000===
Shore&#x27;s first film score was to the low budget thriller &quot;I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses&quot; (1978), followed by David Cronenberg&#x27;s first major film, &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979). He would go on to score all of Cronenberg&#x27;s subsequent films, with the exception of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983), which was scored by Michael Kamen. The first film he scored that was not directed by Cronenberg was Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot; (1985). Following that, he scored &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), again directed by Cronenberg. Two years later, he composed the score to &quot;Big&quot; (1988), directed by Penny Marshall and starring Tom Hanks. He then scored two more of David Cronenberg&#x27;s films: &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; (1988) and &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (1991).

During 1991, Shore composed the score for the highly acclaimed film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, and directed by Jonathan Demme. He received his first BAFTA nomination for the score. The film became the third (and most recent) to win the five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Shore is the only living composer to have scored a &quot;Top Five&quot; Oscar-winning film.

During 1993, he composed the scores for &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; (another collaboration with Cronenberg), &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (his second collaboration with Jonathan Demme), and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, directed by Chris Columbus. The latter two films were highly successful, &quot;Philadelphia&quot; winning Tom Hanks his first Oscar.

Shore scored another three films in 1994: &quot;The Client&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fool&quot;. &quot;Ed Wood&quot; is notable for being one of the three films directed by Tim Burton that did not feature a score by Danny Elfman.

Shore continued to score numerous films from 1995 to 2001, including two David Fincher films, &quot;Seven&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Game&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Truth About Cats and Dogs&quot; (1996), directed by Michael Lehmann; he also collaborated on two films with Cronenberg, along with Tom Hanks&#x27; directorial debut, &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot;. He scored Kevin Smith’s &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999). Shore also composed the score of the 2000 film &quot;The Cell&quot;.

===2001–2006===

Major success came in 2001 with his score to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first film in the highly acclaimed &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The news that Shore would score the trilogy surprised some, since he was primarily associated with dark, ominous films and had never scored an epic of this scale. Yet, the score was hugely successful and won Shore his first Oscar, as well as a Grammy Award, and garnered Shore nominations for a Golden Globe and a BAFTA.

The following year, Shore composed the scores to &quot;Panic Room&quot;, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (replacing Elmer Bernstein), and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, the second film in the trilogy. (The latter two films were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.) Initially, Shore&#x27;s score for &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was going to be deemed ineligible for submission to the academy, due to a new rule disallowing the submission of scores which contained themes from previous work. The implementation of this rule change was subsequently postponed, meaning the score remained eligible. Ultimately, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; score did not receive an Academy Award nomination; Shore did, however, receive a BAFTA nomination for &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;.

In 2003, he composed the score for the final film in &quot;The Lord of the Rings trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The film was the most successful film in the trilogy and the most successful of the year. Shore won his second Oscar for Best Original Score, as well as a third for Best Original Song for &quot;Into the West&quot;, which he shared with Fran Walsh and Annie Lennox. Shore also won his first Golden Globe, his third and fourth Grammy (the fourth for Best Song), and was nominated for a third BAFTA. The scores of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, performed primarily by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, became one of the most successful film scores ever written and the biggest success in Shore&#x27;s career. The score has been repeatedly voted to be the best film score, and the review site Filmtracks named Shore&#x27;s score &quot;arguably the most respected and impressive trilogy of music of all time: Howard Shore&#x27;s massive work for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot; As of April 2023, Shore is currently in litigation with Star-Entertainment Berlin over their unauthorized use of his music from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and poor quality concerts, following a concert on 1 April 2023 at the Portsmouth Guildhall which was reportedly so poor that every audience member was given a full refund and the production company were banned from the premises permanently.

In 2004, Shore again collaborated with Martin Scorsese, scoring his epic film &quot;The Aviator&quot;, this time with the Brussels Philharmonic. He won a second Golden Globe for the score, becoming the third composer to have won consecutive Golden Globes in the Original Score category. He also received his sixth Grammy nomination, and his fifth BAFTA nomination.

He collaborated again with David Cronenberg in 2005 to score &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, starring Viggo Mortensen. (who incidentally also played Aragorn in the lord of the rings trilogy).The film was a success and received two Oscar nominations. In 2006, he collaborated for the fourth time with Martin Scorsese, this time to score &quot;The Departed&quot;. The film was highly successful and won four Oscars, including a long-awaited win for Scorsese, and Best Picture.

Although Shore was originally commissioned to compose the soundtrack for &quot;King Kong&quot;, he was later replaced by James Newton Howard due to &quot;differing creative aspirations for the score&quot; on his and the filmmakers&#x27; parts. This was a mutual agreement between himself and Peter Jackson. Despite this, Shore has a cameo near the end of the film as the conductor of the orchestra in the theater, performing portions of Max Steiner&#x27;s score to the original 1933 version of the film.

===2007–present===
In 2007, Shore composed the music for &quot;Soul of the Ultimate Nation&quot;, an online multiplayer video game, featuring Lydia Kavina on the theremin. During 2007 he also composed the scores for &quot;The Last Mimzy&quot; and &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;, the latter of which includes a section that has been performed in concert as Shore&#x27;s &quot;Concertino for violin solo and chamber orchestra&quot;. &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; was another collaboration with David Cronenberg and earned Shore his fourth Golden Globe nomination. In 2008, he scored &quot;Doubt&quot;, starring Meryl Streep and directed by John Patrick Shanley. The film was a success, earning five Oscar nominations.

In 2010, Shore composed the score to &quot;Eclipse&quot;, the third installment in the &quot;Twilight&quot; film series, following Carter Burwell and Alexandre Desplat, who scored the first and second films, respectively. He then replaced John Corigliano to score &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, starring Mel Gibson.

Shore&#x27;s 2011 projects were &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;, continuing his long-term collaboration with director David Cronenberg. He composed the score to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Hugo&quot;, his fifth collaboration with the director, which earned him a sixth Golden Globe nomination and fourth Oscar nomination.

He created the score to Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series. In addition, Shore composed the opening theme for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot; on Amazon.

==Conducting and performing==
Since 2004, he has toured the world conducting local orchestras in the performance of his new symphonic arrangement of his highly acclaimed &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; scores. The new work is entitled &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Symphony in Six Movements&quot;. There are two movements for each of the movies, and an intermission between the second and third (or first and second film titles) movements. The concert presentation of the symphony also includes projected still images of sketches by John Howe and Alan Lee relating the music being performed to scenes from the films. Recently, however, Shore has been busy with other projects, leaving other conductors including Markus Huber, Ludwig Wicki, Alexander Mickelthwaite, and John Mauceri to lead the orchestras.

April 24, 2008, marked the North American Live to Projection debut of &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, with the score performed live by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Ludwig Wicki. Wicki also conducted the Filene Center Orchestra at the Wolf Trap Farm Park in Vienna, Virginia on May 21 and 22, 2008 in the U.S. premiere of the &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; Live to Projection.

September 16, 2010, Shore conducted the RSO Vienna (Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra) which performed &quot;In Dreams from The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; at Hollywood in Vienna in Vienna, Austria.
Shore was commissioned by Macy&#x27;s to write a Fanfare for the Store&#x27;s 150th anniversary featuring the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Wanamaker Organ, the world&#x27;s largest playing pipe organ. The work was debuted in the Grand Court of Macy&#x27;s Philadelphia Store on September 27, 2008, in a concert that drew reviews from most of the major East Coast newspapers.

Shore&#x27;s opera &quot;The Fly&quot; had its world premiere performance at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on July 2, 2008, and its United States premiere at Los Angeles Opera on September 7, 2008. The production was directed by David Cronenberg and conducted by Plácido Domingo. &quot;The Fly&quot; had a new production mounted by Theatre Trier in Germany in 2014 staged by Sebastian Welker and conducted by Joongbae Jee.

Shore was commissioned by the Beijing Music Festival to write &quot;Ruin and Memory&quot;, a piano concerto, for the pianist Lang Lang. The world premiere was on October 11, 2010, performed by Lang Lang, The China Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Long Yu. His second concerto, &quot;Mythic Gardens&quot;, premiered April 27, 2012, with Sophie Shao on cello solo, The American Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Leon Botstein.

Shore&#x27;s song cycle &quot;A Palace Upon the Ruins&quot; premiered in 2014 at the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival and at the La Jolla SummerFest featuring mezzo-soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano. &quot;A Palace Upon the Ruins&quot; is a song cycle of six songs with words by Elizabeth Cotnoir.

&quot;Sea to Sea&quot; was commissioned by New Brunswick Youth Orchestra in celebration of Canada&#x27;s 150th anniversary of confederation and premiered on July 2, 2017, in Moncton, New Brunswick, with soloist Measha Brueggergosman and Antonio Delgado conducting. &quot;Sea to Sea&quot; has lyrics by Elizabeth Cotnoir.

The song cycle &quot;L&#x27;Aube&quot; premiered October 19 &amp; 20, 2017 in Toronto at Roy Thompson Hall conducted by Peter Oundjian and performed by soloist Susan Platts and commissioning orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. &quot;L&#x27;Aube&quot; consists of five songs with text by Elizabeth Cotnoir.

&quot;The Forest&quot; a guitar concerto composed for Miloš Karadaglić premiered in Ottawa on May 1 &amp; 2, 2019 with the National Arts Centre Orchestra and Alexander Shelley conducting.

==Television==
In addition to writing the original theme song for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as well as the closing theme, Shore also co-wrote the theme song for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; with John Lurie. The theme was carried over to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; when O&#x27;Brien succeeded Jay Leno as host.

In September 2021, it was reported that Shore was in talk to compose the music for the upcoming &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; TV series on Amazon Prime Video, returning from the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Hobbit&quot; films; the series was eventually scored by Bear McCreary with Shore writing the main title theme for the opening credits only.

==Radio==
Shore narrated a one-hour CBC Radio documentary/soundscape on music in thriller/suspense film genres also including references to radio dramas and other media. The episode was called &quot;Unsettling Scores&quot; and premiered on the program called &quot;Inside the Music&quot;.

==Personal life==
He is the uncle of film composer Ryan Shore.

As of 2004, Shore lives in Tuxedo Park, New York. Shore is married to Elizabeth Cotnoir, a writer, producer and documentary filmmaker. He has one daughter.

<doc id="312453" wikidata="Q7598359" url="?curid=312453" title="Standard of deferred payment">
<text>In economics, standard of deferred payment is a function of money. It is the function of being a widely accepted way to value a debt, thereby allowing goods and services to be acquired now and paid for in the future.

The 19th-century economist William Stanley Jevons, influential in the study of money, considered it to be one of four fundamental functions of money, the other three being medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. However, most modern textbooks now list only the other three functions, considering standard of deferred payment to be subsumed by the others.

Most forms of money can act as standards of deferred payment including commodity money, representative money and most commonly fiat money. Representative and fiat money often exist in digital form as well as physical tokens such as coins and notes.

== Functions of money ==

Money is held to serve multiple distinguished but related functions, of which a &quot;standard of deferred payment&quot; is one. The most commonly distinguished functions of money are as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment, summarized in a mnemonic rhyme of older economics texts:
:&quot;Money is a matter of functions four: a medium, a measure, a standard and a store.&quot;
However, many newer texts do not distinguish the function of a standard of deferred payment, subsuming it in other functions.

Being a standard of deferred payment is one of the functions of money; it is distinct from:

* The standard of deferred payment can be distinguished from the medium of exchange function because of how its value might change over time. If payment is to be deferred, it should be denominated in a unit which is expected to maintain its value. Deferred payments require durability when used in trade, and a minimum of opportunity to cheat others — as the diamond or gold examples illustrate.
* the store of value function, which relates to the saving, storing, and retrieval of value; and
* the unit of account function which requires fungibility so accounts in any amount can be readily settled.

When currency is stable, money can serve all four functions. When it is not, or when complex and volatile forms of financial capital are involved, some may wish to identify a single standard of deferred payment to avoid strategic behavior. Otherwise, for example, a debtor might try to select a standard of deferred payment of debt that is forecast to drop in value so the real value of his payment to the lender will be lower. The lender can avoid this by selecting a denomination of debt that is forecast to maintain its value.

== Relation to debt ==

A debt is a deferred payment; a standard of deferred payment is what they are denominated in. Since the value of money – be it dollars, gold, or others – may fluctuate over time via inflation and deflation, the value of deferred payments (the real level of debt) likewise fluctuates.
A device is termed &quot;legal tender&quot; if it may serve to discharge (pay off) debts; thus, while US dollars are not backed by gold or any other commodity, they draw value from being legal tender – being usable to pay off debts.

== Examples ==
Deferred payment is based on enforceability of debts and rule of law, and is not used or rarely used when debts are unlikely to be collectable. For certain kinds of transactions (such as for illegal goods like drugs or weapons), gold or diamonds may be preferred as the medium of exchange — there being no recourse in case of counterfeit currency being used — and there is rarely any deferral of payment: if there is, it will most likely be stated in dollars.

Historically, there have been many times when creditors have had to hide from debtors to avoid being paid off in near worthless currency, typically following hyper-inflation.

Time-based currency such as Ithaca Hours establishes fixed amounts of human labour as the only standard of deferred payment.

<text>In economics, unit of account is one of the functions of money. A unit of account is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and other transactions. Also known as a &quot;measure&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; of relative worth and deferred payment, a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt.

Money acts as a standard measure and a common denomination of trade. It is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices. It is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems.

==Economics==
Unit of account in economics allows a somewhat meaningful interpretation of prices, costs, and profits, so that an entity can monitor its own performance. It allows shareholders to make sense of its past performance and have an idea of its future profitability. The use of money, as a relatively stable unit of measure, can tend to drive market economies toward efficiency.

Historically, prices were often given in a dominant currency used as a unit of account, but transactions actually settled by using a variety of coins that were available, and often goods, all converted into their value in the unit of account. Many international transactions continue to be settled in this way, using a national value (most often expressed in the US dollar or euro) but with the actual settlement in something else.

In historical cost accounting, currencies are assumed to be perfectly stable in real value during non-hyperinflationary conditions under in terms of which the stable measuring unit assumption is applied. The Daily Consumer Price Index (Daily CPI) – or a monetized daily indexed unit of account – can be used to index monetary values on a daily basis when it is required to maintain the purchasing power or real value of monetary values constant during inflation and deflation.

===Problems===
Money is rarely perfectly stable in real value which is the fundamental problem with traditional historical cost accounting which is based on the stable measuring unit assumption. The unit of account in economics suffers from the pitfall of not being stable in real value over time because money is generally not perfectly stable in real value during inflation and deflation. Inflation destroys the assumption that the real value of the unit of account is stable which is the basis of classic accountancy. In such circumstances, historical values registered in accountancy books become heterogeneous amounts measured in different units. The use of such data under traditional accounting methods without previous correction can lead to confusing — (or even meaningless) — results.

===History===
Historic examples of units of measure include the livre tournois, used in France from 1302 to 1794 whether or not livre coins were minted. In the 14th century Naples used the grossi gigliati, and Bohemia used the Prague groschen. (2021)

At any one time there might be two or three units of account in one region based on the local base, silver and sometimes gold coins, and each often expressed in L.S.D units in ratio 240:12:1. The Florentine gold florin, the French franc and the electoral rheingulden all became pounds (240 denari) of account. Units of account would often survive over 100 years despite the original coins changing composition and availability (e.g. the Castilian maravedi).

In 1921, Henry Ford proposed the use of energy as the basis for currency instead of Gold Standard. Thomas Edison similarly put forward commodities as a basis. At the onset of the Great Depression, John P. Norton restated the &quot;Electric Dollars&quot; standard alongside gold. 

A modern unit of account is the European Currency Unit, used in the European Union from 1979 to 1998; its replacement in 1999, the Euro, was also just a unit of account until the introduction of notes and coins in 2002.

Unit of account is the main way of calculating a carrier or ship owner&#x27;s liability in relation to carriage of goods contracts in which the Hague-Visby Rules apply.

In economics, a standard unit of account is used for statistical purposes to describe economic activity. Indexes such as GDP and the CPI are so broad in their scope that compiling them would be impossible without a standard unit of account. After being compiled, these figures are often used to guide governmental policy; especially monetary and fiscal policy.

In calculating the opportunity cost of a policy, a standard unit of account allows for the creation of a composite good. A composite good is a theoretical abstraction that represents an aggregation of all other opportunities that are not realized by the first good. It allows an economic decision&#x27;s benefits to be weighed against the costs of all other possible goods in that society, without having to refer to any directly. Often, this is most easily accomplished with money.

==Finance==
The use of a unit of account in financial accounting, according to the American business model, allows investors to invest capital into those companies that provide the highest rate of return. The use of a unit of account in managerial accounting enables firms to choose between activities that yield the highest profit.

==Accounting==
The unit of account in financial accounting refers to the words used to describe the specific assets and liabilities that are reported in financial statements rather than the units used to measure them. That is, unit of account refers to the object of recognition or display whereas unit of measure refers to the tool for measuring it.

Unit of measure and unit of account are sometimes treated as synonyms in financial accounting and economics. Unit of measure in financial accounting refers to the monetary unit to be used; that is, whether it should be nominal units of money as opposed to units that are adjusted for changes in purchasing power over time.

<text>Pablo Martín Melitón de Sarasate y Navascués (; 10 March 1844 – 20 September 1908), commonly known as Pablo de Sarasate, was a Spanish violinist, composer and conductor of the Romantic period. His best known works include &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Airs&quot;), the &quot;Spanish Dances&quot;, and the &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot;.

==Biography==

Sarasate was born in Pamplona, Navarre, in 1844, the son of Don Miguel Sarasate, a local artillery bandmaster. Apparently, after seeing his father struggle with a passage for a long time, he picked up the violin and played it perfectly. He began studying the violin with his father at the age of five and later took lessons from a local teacher. His musical talent became evident early on and he appeared in his first public concert in A Coruña at the age of eight.

His performance was well-received, and caught the attention of a wealthy patron who provided the funding for Sarasate to study under Manuel Rodríguez Saez in Madrid, where he gained the favor of Queen Isabella II. Later, as his abilities developed, his parents decided to send him to study under Jean-Delphin Alard at the Paris Conservatoire at the age of twelve. Aboard the train en route to Paris, his mother (who had been accompanying him) died of a heart attack at the Spanish-French border, and Sarasate was found to be suffering from cholera. The Spanish Consul in Bayonne took Sarasate to his home and nursed him back to health, then financed his trip to Paris.

There, Sarasate auditioned successfully for Alard, who arranged for him to live with his colleague Théodore de Lassabathie, administrator of the Conservatoire. At seventeen, Sarasate entered a competition for the Premier Prix and won his first prize, the Conservatoire&#x27;s highest honor. (No other Spanish violinist achieved this until Manuel Quiroga did so in 1911; Quiroga was frequently compared to Sarasate throughout his career.)

Sarasate, who had been publicly performing since childhood, made his Paris debut as a concert violinist in 1860, and played in London the following year. Over the course of his career, he toured many parts of the world, performing in Europe, North America, and South America. His artistic pre-eminence was due principally to the purity of his tone, which was free from any tendency towards the sentimental or rhapsodic, and to that impressive facility of execution that made him a virtuoso. In his early career, Sarasate performed mainly opera fantasies, most notably the &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot;, and various other pieces that he had composed. The popularity of Sarasate&#x27;s Spanish flavour in his compositions is reflected in the work of his contemporaries. For example, the influences of Spanish music can be heard in such notable works as Édouard Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie espagnole&quot; which was dedicated to Sarasate; Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;; and Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso&quot;, written expressly for Sarasate and dedicated to him.
Of Sarasate&#x27;s idiomatic writing for his instrument, the playwright and music critic George Bernard Shaw once declared that though there were many composers of music for the violin, there were but few composers of violin music. Of Sarasate&#x27;s talents as performer and composer, Shaw said that he &quot;left criticism gasping miles behind him&quot;. Sarasate&#x27;s own compositions are mainly show-pieces designed to demonstrate his exemplary technique. Perhaps the best known of his works is &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; (1878), a work for violin and orchestra. Another piece, the &quot;Carmen Fantasy&quot; (1883), also for violin and orchestra, makes use of themes from Georges Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. Probably his most performed encores are his four books of &quot;Spanish Dances&quot;, Opp. 21, 22, 23, 26, brief pieces designed to please the listener&#x27;s ear and show off the performer&#x27;s talent. He also made arrangements of a number of other composers&#x27; work for violin, and composed sets of variations on &quot;potpourris&quot; drawn from operas familiar to his audiences, such as his Fantasia on &quot;La forza del destino&quot; (his Opus 1), his &quot;Souvenirs de &quot;Faust&quot;&quot;, or his variations on themes from &quot;Die Zauberflöte.&quot;

At Brussels, he met Berthe Marx, who traveled with him as soloist and accompanist on his tours through Europe, Mexico, and the US; playing in about 600 concerts. She also arranged Sarasate&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Dances&quot; for the piano. In 1904, he made a small number of recordings. In all his travels Sarasate returned to Pamplona each year for the San Fermín festival.
Sarasate died in Biarritz, France, on 20 September 1908, from chronic bronchitis. He bequeathed his violin, made by Antonio Stradivari in 1724, to the Musée de la Musique. The violin now bears his name as the &quot;Sarasate Stradivarius&quot; in his memory. His second Stradivari violin, the &quot;Boissier&quot; of 1713, is now owned by Real Conservatorio Superior de Música, Madrid. Among his violin pupils was Alfred de Sève. The Pablo Sarasate International Violin Competition is held in Pamplona.

A number of works for violin were dedicated to Sarasate, including Henryk Wieniawski&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto No. 2&quot;, Édouard Lalo&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie espagnole&quot;, Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;Violin Concerto No. 3&quot; and his &quot;Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso&quot;, Max Bruch&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Fantasy&quot;, and Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Pibroch Suite&quot;. Also inspired by Sarasate is William H. Potstock&#x27;s &quot;Souvenir de Sarasate&quot;.

==Appearance in other art forms==
* James Whistler&#x27;s &quot;Arrangement in Black: Pablo de Sarasate&quot; (1884) is a portrait of Pablo Sarasate.
*In Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s short story &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; (1891), Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John H. Watson attend a concert by Sarasate. Violinist Bruce Dukov portrays Sarasate in the 1984 Granada Television adaptation of the story.
*Sarasate is a major figure in &quot;Murder to Music&quot;, a Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Anthony Burgess. Holmes is also mentioned as attending a Sarasate concert in &quot;The Treasure Train&quot; by Frankie Thomas.
*In Edith Wharton&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot;, set in 1870s New York, the main protagonist is invited to a private recital to be given by Sarasate.
* &quot;Zigeunerweisen&quot; is the title of Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s 1980 movie, the first of the so-called Taisho Trilogy. A recording of the air of the same title by Sarasate, and his that can be heard on the recording, are one of the themes of the movie.
* He appears in Mercedes Lackey&#x27;s &quot;Elemental Masters&quot; story &quot;A Study in Sable&quot; (based on the folk tale &quot;The Twa Sisters&quot;), as an Elemental Master of Spirit, able to conjure, speak with, and to some extent control ghosts with his music; he even goes so far as to use a bow made of the bone and hair of a murdered woman in an effort to bring her murderous sister to justice.

==List of compositions==
Sarasate composed more than fifty works, all of which include the violin. He assigned opus numbers to 54 of them.

<text>Carisbrooke Castle is a historic motte-and-bailey castle located in the village of Carisbrooke (near Newport), Isle of Wight, England. Charles I was imprisoned at the castle in the months prior to his trial.

==Early history==
The site of Carisbrooke Castle may have been occupied in pre-Roman times. A ruined wall suggests that there was a building there in late Roman times. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; mentions that Wihtgar, cousin of King Cynric of Wessex, died in AD 544, and was buried there. The Jutes may have taken over the fort by the late 7th century. An Anglo-Saxon stronghold occupied the site during the 8th century. Around AD 1000, a wall was built around the hill as a defence against Viking raids.

==Later history==
From 1100 the castle remained in the possession of Richard de Redvers&#x27; family, and over the next two centuries his descendants improved the castle with stone walls, towers and a keep. In 1293, Countess Isabella de Fortibus, the last Redvers resident, sold the castle to Edward I. From then on, its governance was entrusted to wardens as representatives of the crown.

In 1377, in the reign of Richard II the castle was unsuccessfully attacked by the French. It was reputedly saved by local hero Peter de Heyno who shot the French commander. Anthony Woodville, Lord Scales, later Earl Rivers, obtained a grant of the castle and rights of Lordship in 1467. He was responsible for the addition of the Woodville Gate, now known as the Entrance Gate. Woodville was killed by Richard III in 1483, but his brother Edward Woodville was given control of the castle on the accession of Henry VII in 1485.

The keep was added to the castle in the reign of Henry I, and in the reign of Elizabeth I, when the Spanish Armada was expected, it was surrounded by additional fortifications by Sir George Carey, who had been appointed Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1583. Carey later commissioned the Italian engineer Federigo Giambelli (or Genebelli) to make more substantial improvements to the defences. Starting in 1597, Giambelli constructed a modern &quot;trace Italienne&quot; fortification, a squat rampart and ditch supported at intervals by powerful bastions, which completely surrounded the old castle and bailey. The new fortification was mostly completed by 1600 at the cost of £4,000.
Charles I was imprisoned here for fourteen months before his execution in 1649. Afterwards his two youngest children were confined in the castle, and Princess Elizabeth died there. From 1896 to 1944, it was the home of Princess Beatrice, daughter of Queen Victoria, as Governor of the Isle of Wight. It is now under the control of English Heritage.

The castle is located above, and to the south of, Carisbrooke village centre.

In 2007, English Heritage opened a holiday flat inside the castle, in converted former staff quarters. The castle received 131,358 visitors during 2019.

==Description==

Carisbrooke was the strongest castle on the Island; though it is visible from some distance, it does not dominate the countryside like many other castles.

There are traces of a Roman fort underneath the later buildings. Seventy-one steps lead up to the keep. In the centre of the castle enclosure are the domestic buildings; these are mostly of the 13th century, with upper parts of the 16th century. Some are in ruins, but the main rooms were used as the official residence of the governor of the Isle of Wight until the 1940s, and they remain in good repair.

The Great Hall, Great Chamber and several smaller rooms are open to the public, and an upper room houses the Isle of Wight Museum. Most rooms are partly furnished.

One of the main subjects of the museum is King Charles I. He tried to escape from the castle in 1648 but was unable to get through the bars of his window.

The name of the castle is echoed in a very different structure on the other side of the world. A visit to the castle by James Macandrew, one of the founders of the New Zealand city of Dunedin, led to him naming his estate &quot;Carisbrook&quot;. The name of the estate was later used for Dunedin&#x27;s main sporting venue.

===The Main Gate===
The gateway tower was erected by Lord Scales who was lord of the castle at the time in 1464.

===The Chapel===

The chapel is located next to the main gate. In 1904 the chapel of St Nicholas in the castle was reopened and re-consecrated, having been rebuilt as a national memorial of Charles I. Within the walls is a well deep and another in the centre of the keep is reputed to have been still deeper.

===The Well-House===

Near the domestic buildings is the well-house with its working donkey wheel. The well is also famous as the hiding place of the Mohune diamond, in the 1898 adventure novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot;, by J. Meade Falkner. Wyndham Lewis, who lived on the Isle of Wight as a child, cites the donkey wheel at Carisbrooke as an image for the way machines impose a way of life on human beings (&#x27;Inferior Religions&#x27;, published 1917).

===The Constable&#x27;s Chamber===
The Constable&#x27;s Chamber is a large room located in the castle&#x27;s medieval section. It was the bedroom of Charles I when he was imprisoned in the castle, and Princess Beatrice used it as a dining room. It is now home to Charles I bed as well as Princess Beatrice&#x27;s large collection of stag and antelope heads. This room was until recently used as the castle&#x27;s education centre.

===Earthworks===
Surrounding the whole castle are large earthworks, designed by the Italian Federigo Gianibelli, and begun in the year before the Spanish Armada. They were finished in the 1590s. The outer gate has the date 1598 and the arms of Elizabeth I.

<text>Andrew Lesnie ACS ASC (1 January 1956 – 27 April 2015) was an Australian cinematographer. He was best known as the cinematographer for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–2003) and its prequel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy (2012–2014), both directed by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. He received the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 2002.

==Early life==
Lesnie was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 1 January 1956, the son of Shirley (Lithgow) and Allan Lesnie, who worked for the family&#x27;s company, butcher suppliers Harry Lesnie Pty Ltd.

He was educated at Sydney Grammar School. Andrew was well liked and popular at school. Lesnie finished 6th form and his Higher School Certificate in 1974. He started his career in 1978 as an assistant camera operator on the film &quot;Patrick&quot; (1978) while he was still in school at Australian Film, Television and Radio School (AFTRS). sd

His first job after graduation in 1979 was as a cameraman on the Logie Award-winning Australian magazine-style afternoon TV show &quot;Simon Townsend&#x27;s Wonder World&quot;. Simon Townsend gave Lesnie almost daily opportunities to develop his craft with little restriction over a wide variety of stories and situations, and to experiment with camera and lighting techniques in hundreds of locations and situations. After two years of working on the show, Lesnie moved on to numerous Australian film and television productions, including the mini-series &quot;Bodyline&quot;.

Later, he worked as a second camera assistant on the film &quot;The Killing of Angel Street&quot; (1981).

Lesnie would then go on to develop his craft as he photographed films such as &quot;Stations&quot; (1983), &quot;The Delinquents&quot; (1989), &quot;Temptation of the Monk&quot; (1993), and &quot;Spider and Rose&quot; (1994).

==Career==
Lesnie&#x27;s work began receiving major attention after the release of the anthropomorphic pig story &quot;Babe&quot; (1995) and its sequel, &quot;&quot;. He was director of photography on Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, and received an Oscar for his work on &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 2002. Since then, he filmed several other Jackson-directed films, including &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, and also filmed &quot;The Hobbit&quot; films directed by Jackson.

===&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–03)===
Lesnie used motion picture camera company Arri&#x27;s Arriflex 435, Arriflex 535, and ArriCam Studio 35mm film cameras for the trilogy. He used Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime Lenses and Kodak&#x27;s 5279 (tungsten-balanced) film stock to photograph the films.

Lesnie planned far ahead into the production with Peter Jackson with previsualisation programs to help establish frame sizes and angles, as well as construction of sets. During filming, Lesnie emphasised earthy colours in the makeup and wardrobe of the cast and extras.

At the acceptance speech for his Oscar win for &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Lesnie dedicated his acceptance to chief lighting technician Brian Bansgrove, who he described as a major contributor to the quality of the film&#x27;s cinematography.

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy (2012–14)===

For production, Lesnie used Red Digital Cinema&#x27;s Epic cameras as well as Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime Lenses to photograph the film. Jackson and Lesnie decided to shoot the film in 3D with as many as 15 stereoscopic camera rigs (2 cameras each) with 3ality. They also decided to shoot the film in an uncommon frame rate of 48 frames per second versus the industry standard of 24 frames per second. This would make Lesnie the first cinematographer to employ such a method that claims to induce more clarity, reduce motion blur, and make 3D easier to watch.

===&quot;The Water Diviner&quot;===
Lesnie&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, directed by and starring Russell Crowe, was released in Australia in December 2014 and in America in April 2015, one week before his death.

==Personal life and death==

Lesnie lived on Sydney&#x27;s north coast. He was a member of both the Australian Cinematographers Society and the American Society of Cinematographers. Lesnie died of a heart attack in his Sydney home on 27 April 2015, after having suffered from a heart condition for half a year.

== Etymology ==
There are various theories linked to the origin of the name Nellore. According to a mythological story from the Sthala Purana, the name is connected to a sacred lingam in the form of a stone found beneath a Phyllanthus emblica tree, also known as the nelli tree (, meaning &#x27;emblica tree&#x27; in Proto-Dravidian and Telugu). The presence of the nelli tree in this story is believed to be one of the etymological roots of the region&#x27;s name.

Another theory is that the name &quot;Nellore&quot; is derived from the Telugu word &quot;nellu&quot;, which means &quot;paddy&quot; or &quot;rice.&quot; The region is renowned for its vast rice cultivation, and the name reflects its agricultural heritage and the importance of rice production in the area. Over time, the name &quot;Nelluru&quot; evolved into the modern form &quot;Nellore,&quot; used in both Telugu and Tamil-speaking regions.

Historically, the area was known as Vikrama Simhapuri in medieval era. The abundance of paddy fields eventually led to the name being changed to Nellore. The region has long been associated with agriculture, particularly rice cultivation, which continues to play a significant role in its economy today.

<doc id="312479" wikidata="Q6432014" url="?curid=312479" title="Korean nobility">
<text>Korean monarchy existed in Korea until the end of the Japanese occupation and the defeat of Japan. After the independence and the installation of the Constitution that adopted republic system, the concept of nobility has been abolished, both formally and in practice.

==Sources==
As the Benedictines and other monastical orders did during Europe&#x27;s Dark Ages, the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea&#x27;s literary traditions while documenting Korea&#x27;s written history and legacies from the Silla period to the end of the Goryeo dynasty. Korean Buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history—some 500 years before Gutenberg—to print ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court.

==Ruler and princely styles==
===Original titles===
The monarchs of Goguryeo adopted the title of &quot;Taewang&quot;, which placed them on the same level as the Chinese emperors. The literal translation of the title is the &quot;Supreme King&quot;. The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of &quot;Geoseogan&quot;, &quot;Chachaung&quot;, &quot;Isageum&quot;, and finally &quot;Maripgan&quot; until 503. This follows from an earlier tradition when Korean kings were styled either &quot;Han&quot; or &quot;Kan&quot;, which are cognates of the Turkic &quot;khan&quot;. &quot;Marip&quot; originally meant the highest, and &quot;gan&quot; meant rulers. In addition, Baekje used the title of &quot;Eoraha&quot;, &quot;Ha&quot; meaning &quot;rulers&quot; and &quot;Eora&quot; meaning &quot;the largest&quot;.

===Imperial titles===
Goguryeo monarchs adopted the title &quot;Taewang&quot; ().

Goryeo monarchs adopted the title(s) &quot;Seonghwang&quot; () or emperor. However, unlike the Goguryeo, the imperial titles were not used in diplomatic campaigns with the prominent Chinese Dynasties of that time. Goryeo dropped its Imperial title for a short period after the peace treaty with the Mongols. It was later reinstated for a short while after the Goryeo dynasty defeated the Mongols in the 1360s.

The title &quot;Hwangje&quot; () was revived for less than two decades during the Korean Empire that came after Joseon.

===Royal titles===
&quot;Wang&quot; () was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of Gojoseon, Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje, Silla and Balhae, Goryeo. In late Goryeo (918-1392) and the Joseon Dynasty (until 1897) the rulers of Korea were still known as &quot;wang&quot;, as evident in the title of King Sejong the Great. However, they were referred to by their temple names.

Although often translated in English as &quot;king&quot;, this title also applied to a female ruler. Female rulers, equivalent to queen regnant in English, were informally referred to as &quot;yeowang&quot; ().

&quot;Wangbi&quot; () was title for the wife of the reigning king, equivalent to queen consort in English.

The title &quot;Daewang&quot; () was also used in many Korean states.

Balhae monarchs adopted the title &quot;Seongwang&quot; ().

===Prince===

&quot;Gun&quot; () has the common meaning of &#x27;monarch&#x27;, however in this specific context, it can also mean &#x27;prince&#x27;. Before the Joseon era, the regulations behind the entitlement of royals and nobles were unclear and inconsistent. In the early Goryeo Dynasty, the sons of the king who were not the crown prince, were entitled as &quot;gun&quot;s, &quot;wongun&quot;s, &quot;gunggun&quot;s, while after 1031, royals began to be entitled using five ranks, which were: &quot;gongjak&quot; - Duke, &quot;hujak&quot; - Marquess, &quot;baekjak&quot; - Count, &quot;jajak&quot; - Viscount, and &quot;namjak&quot; - Baron. It is after the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty that this becomes solid.

In the Joseon Dynasty, solid regulations about investiture were established, for both royals and non-royals. Legitimate sons of the king (those born of the queen consort) were entitled as a d&quot;aegun&quot; (). The princes born of concubine was given the title &quot;gun&quot;, distinguished from &quot;daeguns&quot; with the term &quot;wangjagun&quot; (), combining the word meaning &#x27;king&#x27;s son&#x27; - prince and &quot;gun&quot;. The &quot;gun&quot; title could be succeeded up to the great-grandsons of a &quot;daegun&quot;, grandsons of the crown prince and &quot;wangjagun&quot;s, The father of the king who himself has never reigned was given the special title of &quot;daewongun&quot; ().

Non-royal servants could also receive the princely title as well. &quot;Buwongun&quot; (), was the title of the father of the queen consort, or &quot;gongsin&quot;s who have reached the first rank. A &quot;gongsin&quot; () was the title of a servant who had distinguished himself in the service of the king and court. They were eligible to be invested as a &quot;gun&quot; after they reached the second rank. (And even if they did not in their lifetime, they would be raised to the second rank posthumously, therefore qualifying them for entitlement.)

When one became a &quot;gongsin&quot;, his ancestors up to his paternal great-grandparent would be posthumously promoted in rank, with his father especially being named different classes of &quot;gongsin&quot; depending on the class of the &quot;gongsin&quot; title of his son (first to third class). He would also be entitled as a &quot;gun&quot;, all posthumously.

All &quot;gun&quot; titles had a prefix attached to them, the name of that servant&#x27;s &quot;bon-gwan&quot;. For example, Yoon In-Gyeong, a 16th century politician, was named a &quot;gongsin&quot; in the aftermath of the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, among thirty others. Because of this, he was raised to the first rank and therefore was invested as the Paseong Buwongun (). Paseong is the name of his bon-gwan, Papyeong (), with the second character altered into &quot;seong&quot;. This was done in order to avoid confusions between guns that had the same bon-gwan and therefore the same title name, a practice done with other characters commonly attached to place names as suffixes, such as &quot;san&quot; (), &quot;cheon&quot; (), &quot;ahn&quot; (), etc. Though designed as a titular appointment as a lord of the area, the title was purely honorific.

The gun title could only be entitled upon the eldest descendant of the gongsin when he reached the second rank. Those who had their titles inherited would be referred to as &quot;seungseupgun&quot; (), similarly to the concept of &quot;wangjagun&quot;. The inheritance was called &quot;seungseup&quot; (). &quot;Buwongun&quot; titles earned by being the father of the queen consort could not be inherited.

The dethroned rulers of Joseon Dynasty that did not receive a temple name are presently referred to as their gun title from when they were princes. There were three dethroned kings known as &quot;gun&quot;s in the Joseon Dynasty (one restored to the dignity of king and given a temple name posthumously).

Under the Korean Empire (1897-1910), the close male relatives of the Emperor were given the title of &quot;chinwang&quot; (). While the literal translation of the title is &#x27;imperial king of the blood&#x27;, the meaning that fits here is &#x27;imperial prince of the blood&#x27;, as &#x27;king&#x27; is one step down from &#x27;emperor&#x27;. Only four &quot;chinwang&quot; were appointed; the three sons and one brother of Gojong.

==Aristocracy before Joseon==
===Silla===
In Silla, the nobility was categorized by the Bone rank system.

Royal families split into two classes: sacred bone, which meant eligibility for the royal succession, and true bone, until the former was extinguished.

Non-royal nobles split into three classes: the 6th head rank, the 5th head rank and the 4th head rank; the 6th being the highest.

===Goryeo===
Servants that were not royals would be given titles and land that had the words &quot;gaeguk&quot; (). This word meant founding of a state, but this was a system transferred from China during the Later Three Kingdoms Period, and by that time the feudal system related to the distribution of land as separate fiefs as implied in the word &quot;gaeguk&quot; had mainly faded. In Goryeo, this feudal system remained in place until 1436. These titles had a two character prefix that represented the land that the recipient was affiliated to/was from - land that would be distributed to them in the system called &quot;sigeup&quot; ().
* Gukgaegukgong (국개국공, 國開國公), Duke of a state
* Gungaegukgong (군개국공, 郡開國公), Duke of a county
* Hyeongaegukhu (현개국후, 縣開國侯), Marquis of a town
* Hyeongaegukbaek (현개국백, 縣開國伯), Count of a town
* Gaegukja (개국자, 開國子), Viscount
* Hyeonnam (현개국남, 縣開國男), Baron of a town
Starting from 1031, Goryeo princes began to be invested in 6 different classes of titles, the same way as nobles not of the royal family, but with the &quot;gaeguk&quot; fixes removed.

Also the title Taeja () was given to sons of emperor not like other east Asian countries. In other countries, this title meant crown prince. Taeja was similar to Chinwang () of the Korean Empire.

==Noble families in Korea==

Some clans whose social rank throughout Korean history could be considered equivalent to nobility are as follows (this is merely a sample and nowhere near the total list of families who attained and/or retained such social rank over the duration of Korea&#x27;s lengthy history; families on this list are often also recognizable via their status during the Joseon era as yangban families).

List of Noble families in Korea, such as:
* House of Yi (Joseon Dynasty)
* House of Moon (East Tamna Dynasty, Jeju Island)
* House of Ko (West Tamna Dynasty, Jeju Island)
* House of Park (Silla Dynasty)
* Papyeong Yoon
* Cheongju Han
* Gyeongju Yi
* Andong Kim
* Gimhae Kim
* Miryang Park
* Yeoheung Min
* Dalseong Seo
* Gyeongju Seok
* Pyeongyang Ko

==Foreign noble families in Korea==
The Chinese Ming Xia emperor Ming Yuzhen&#x27;s son Ming Sheng was given the noble title Marquis of Guiyi by the Ming dynasty Hongwu Emperor after his surrender. Ming Sheng was then exiled to Korea at the age of 17 in 1372 by the Ming dynasty. The Korean official Yun Hui-chong&#x27;s married his daughter off to Ming Sheng in March 1373. The emperor asked the Korean king to treat Ming Sheng as a foreign noble by giving his descendants and family corvée and taxation exemptions. These were granted by a patent from the Korean king which lasted until the invading soldiers in the Qing invasion of Joseon destroyed the Ming family&#x27;s patents. The Chinese Ming family exists as the Korean clans, Yeonan Myeong clan, Seochok Myeong clan and Namwon Seung clan.

== Early life ==
=== Family ===
Robards was born July 26, 1922, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of actor Jason Robards Sr. and Hope Maxine Robards (née Glanville). He was of German, English, Welsh, Irish, and Swedish descent. The family moved to New York City when Jason Jr. was still a toddler, and then moved to Los Angeles when he was six years old. Later interviews with Robards suggested that the trauma of his parents&#x27; divorce, which occurred during his grade-school years, greatly affected his personality and world view. From his parents&#x27; first marriage together, he had a younger brother named Glenn. He had little or no contact with his mother after the divorce. She later married a second time to Arthur Milburn, making him his stepfather, although he may or may not have known about it at the time. His father married a second time to Agnes Lynch. He was probably closer to his stepmother than his biological one. From his father&#x27;s second marriage, he had a half-sister named Laurel.

As a youth, Robards also experienced the decline of his father&#x27;s acting career. The elder Robards had enjoyed considerable success during the era of silent films, but he fell out of favor after the advent of sound film, leaving the younger Robards soured on the Hollywood film industry. The teenage Robards excelled in athletics, running a 4:18-mile during his junior year at Hollywood High School in Los Angeles. (Note: The California state high school mile run record in 1940 was 4:26.) Although his prowess in sports attracted interest from several universities, Robards decided to enlist in the United States Navy upon his graduation in 1940.

=== Naval service ===
Following the completion of recruit training and radio school, Robards was assigned to the heavy cruiser in 1941 as a radioman 3rd class. On December 7, 1941, &quot;Northampton&quot; was at sea in the Pacific Ocean about off Hawaii. Contrary to some stories, he did not see the devastation of the Japanese attack on Hawaii until &quot;Northampton&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor two days later. &quot;Northampton&quot; was later directed into the Guadalcanal campaign in World War II&#x27;s Pacific theater, where she participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.

During the Battle of Tassafaronga in the waters north of Guadalcanal on the night of November 30, 1942, &quot;Northampton&quot; was sunk by hits from two Japanese torpedoes. Robards found himself treading water until near daybreak, when he was rescued by an American destroyer. For its service in the war, &quot;Northampton&quot; was awarded six battle stars. Two years later, in November 1944, Robards was radioman aboard the light cruiser , the flagship for the invasion of Mindoro in the northern Philippines. On December 13, she was struck by a kamikaze aircraft off Negros Island in the Philippines. The aircraft hit one of the port five-inch gun mounts, while the plane&#x27;s two bombs set the midsection of the ship ablaze. With this damage and 223 casualties, &quot;Nashville&quot; was forced to return to Pearl Harbor and then to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, for repairs.

Robards served honorably during the war, but was not a recipient of the U.S. Navy Cross, contrary to what has been reported in numerous sources. The inaccurate story derives from a 1979 column by Hy Gardner. Aboard &quot;Nashville&quot;, Robards first found a copy of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; in the ship&#x27;s library. Also while in the Navy, he first started thinking seriously about becoming an actor. He had emceed for a Navy band in Pearl Harbor, got a few laughs, and decided he liked it. His father suggested he enroll in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (AADA) in New York City, from which he graduated in 1948. Robards left the Navy in 1946 as a Petty officer first class. He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal of the Navy, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.

<text>Ensign (later Lieutenant Commander) George Henry Gay Jr. (March 8, 1917 – October 21, 1994) was a Douglas TBD Devastator pilot in United States Navy Torpedo Squadron 8 operating from the aircraft carrier in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. Of the 30 VT-8 aircrew from &quot;Hornet&quot; that participated in the pivotal Battle of Midway, Ensign Gay was the sole survivor.

==Early years==
George Henry Gay Jr. was born on March 8, 1917, in Waco, Texas. He attended school in both Austin and Houston before enrolling at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University).

==World War II==
Like millions of Americans at the time, Gay chose to sign up for the coming war, leaving school. He tried to join the Army Air Corps as a pilot but was rejected for medical reasons. He then tried the United States Navy in early 1941. Gay completed flight training and was commissioned as an ensign in September 1941.

He joined the newly formed Torpedo Squadron 8 under Lieutenant Commander John Charles Waldron. He and his unit were aboard the aircraft carrier in April 1942 when Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle launched his raid on Tokyo. One week later, &quot;Hornet&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor to join as part of Task Force 16 during the Battle of Midway.

During the Battle of Midway, Gay was the first of his squadron to take off from &quot;Hornet&quot; on June 4, 1942. Gay&#x27;s squadron found the Japanese fleet and launched an attack without any fighter plane support. Although he was wounded and his radioman/gunner, Robert K. Huntington, was dying, Gay completed his torpedo attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier , but &quot;Sōryū&quot; evaded his torpedo. Rather than banking away from the ship and presenting a larger target to its anti-aircraft gunners, Gay continued in toward the carrier at low altitude. He then brought his Devastator into a tight turn as he approached the carrier&#x27;s island, and flew aft along the flight deck&#x27;s length, thus evading anti-aircraft fire. He later stated he had a &quot;split second&quot; thought of crashing into the Japanese aircraft he saw being serviced on the flight deck.

With his aircraft still in relatively good condition, he decided to make for &quot;Hornet&quot; after clearing the Japanese carrier. However, five Mitsubishi A6M Zeros brought his aircraft down in a hail of machine-gun and cannon fire, killing his rear gunner.

Exiting his aircraft, and floating in the ocean, he hid under his seat cushion for hours to avoid Japanese strafing attacks and witnessed the subsequent dive bombing attacks and sinking of three of the four Japanese aircraft carriers.

After dark, Gay felt it was safe to inflate his life raft. He was rescued by a Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina after spending over 30 hours in the water. Gay was later flown to (arriving June 28, 1942), before being transferred home. Of the squadron&#x27;s thirty pilots and radiomen, Gay was the only survivor.

Gay later met with Admiral Nimitz and confirmed the destruction of three Japanese carriers he had witnessed – &quot;Akagi&quot;, &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Sōryū&quot;. He was featured in the August 31, 1942, issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

Following Midway, Gay took part in the Guadalcanal Campaign with Torpedo Squadron 11, and later became a Navy flight instructor.

He was awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart for his actions in combat at Midway and was later awarded an Air Medal.

==Later years==
After World War II, Gay spent over 30 years as a pilot for Trans World Airlines. He often lectured on his Midway experiences, and authored the book &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;. In 1975, he served as a consultant on the set for the movie &quot;Midway&quot;, in which Kevin Dobson played Gay. In the 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;, he was portrayed by Brandon Sklenar.

He attended the decommissioning ceremony of on April 11, 1992.

In May 1994 Gay was named to the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.

On October 21, 1994, Gay died of a heart attack at a hospital in Marietta, Georgia. His body was cremated and his ashes spread at the place where his squadron had launched its ill-fated attack.

===Navy Cross citation===

:Ensign George Henry Gay, Jr
:U.S. Navy
:Date Of Action: June 4, 1942
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Ensign George Henry Gay, Jr., United States Naval Reserve, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Pilot of a carrier-based Navy Torpedo Plane of Torpedo Squadron EIGHT (VT-8), attached to the U.S.S. HORNET (CV-8), during the &quot;Air Battle of Midway,&quot; against enemy Japanese forces on 4 June 1942. Grimly aware of the hazardous consequences of flying without fighter protection, and with insufficient fuel to return to his carrier, Ensign Gay, resolutely, and with no thought of his own life, delivered an effective torpedo attached against violent assaults of enemy Japanese aircraft and against an almost solid barrage of anti-aircraft fire. His courageous action, carried out with a gallant spirit of self-sacrifice and a conscientious devotion to the fulfillment of his mission, was a determining factor in the defeat of the enemy forces and was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

<text>The German American Bund, or the German American Federation (, &quot;Amerikadeutscher Volksbund&quot;, AV), was a German-American Nazi organization which was established in 1936 as a successor to the Friends of New Germany (FONG, FDND in German). The organization chose its new name in order to emphasize its American credentials after the press accused it of being unpatriotic. The Bund was allowed to consist only of American citizens of German descent. Its main goal was to promote a favorable view of Nazi Germany.

==History==

===Friends of New Germany===

In May 1933, Nazi Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess gave German immigrant and German Nazi Party member Heinz Spanknöbel authority to form an American Nazi organization. Shortly thereafter, with help from the German consul in New York City, Spanknöbel created the Friends of New Germany by merging two older organizations in the United States, Gau-USA and the Free Society of Teutonia, which were both small groups with only a few hundred members each. The FONG was based in New York City but had a strong presence in Chicago. Male members wore a uniform: a white shirt, black trousers and a black hat adorned with a red symbol. Female members wore a white blouse and a black skirt.

The organization was openly pro-Nazi and engaged in political activities such as storming the German language &quot;New Yorker Staats-Zeitung&quot; and demanding that it publish pro-Nazi articles, and infiltrating other non-political German-American organizations. One of the Friends&#x27; early initiatives was to use propaganda to counter the Jewish boycott of German goods, which was started in March 1933 as a protest against Nazi antisemitism.

In an internal battle for control of the Friends, Spanknöbel was ousted as its leader and subsequently, he was deported in October 1933 because he had failed to register as a foreign agent.

At the same time, Congressman Samuel Dickstein, chairman of the Committee on Naturalization and Immigration, became aware of the substantial number of foreigners who were legally and illegally entering the country and residing in it, and the growing antisemitism along with vast amounts of antisemitic literature which were being distributed in the country. This led him to independently investigate the activities of Nazi and fascist groups, leading to the formation of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, which was authorized to investigate Nazi propaganda activities and certain other propaganda activities. Throughout the rest of 1934, the Committee conducted hearings, bringing most of the major figures in the American fascist movement before it. Dickstein&#x27;s investigation concluded that the Friends represented a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party in the United States.

The organization existed into the mid-1930s, although it always remained small, with a membership of between 5,000 and 10,000, mostly consisting of German citizens who were living in the United States and German emigrants who had only recently become citizens. In December 1935, Rudolf Hess ordered all German citizens to leave the FONG and all of its leaders were recalled to Germany.

===Bund&#x27;s activities===
On March 19, 1936, the German American Bund was established as a follow-up organization for the Friends of New Germany in Buffalo, New York. The Bund elected a German-born American citizen Fritz Julius Kuhn as its leader (&quot;Bundesführer&quot;). Kuhn was a veteran because he served in the Bavarian infantry during World War I and he was also an &quot;Alter Kämpfer&quot; (&quot;old fighter&quot;) for the Nazi Party who was granted American citizenship in 1934. Kuhn was initially effective as a leader because he was able to unite the organization and expand its membership but later, he simply came to be seen as an incompetent swindler and a liar.

The administrative structure of the Bund mimicked the regional administrative subdivisions of the Nazi Party. The German American Bund divided the United States into three &quot;Gaue&quot;: Gau Ost (East), Gau West and Gau Midwest. Together the three &quot;Gaue&quot; comprised 69 &quot;Ortsgruppen&quot; (local groups): 40 in Gau Ost (17 in New York), 10 in Gau West and 19 in Gau Midwest. Each Gau had its own &quot;Gauleiter&quot; and staff to direct the Bund operations in the region in accordance with the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;. The Bund&#x27;s national headquarters was located at 178 East 85th Street in the New York City borough of Manhattan.

The Bund established a number of training camps, including Camp Nordland in Sussex County, New Jersey, Camp Siegfried in Yaphank, New York, Camp Hindenburg in Grafton, Wisconsin, the Deutschhorst Country Club in Sellersville, Pennsylvania, Camp Bergwald in Bloomingdale, New Jersey, and Camp Highland in Windham, New York. The Bund held rallies with Nazi insignia and procedures such as the Hitler salute and attacked the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jewish-American groups, Communism, &quot;Moscow-directed&quot; trade unions and American boycotts of German goods. The organization claimed to show its loyalty to America by displaying the flag of the United States alongside the flag of Nazi Germany at Bund meetings, and it declared that George Washington was &quot;the first Fascist&quot; because he did not believe that democracy would work.

Kuhn and a few other &quot;Bundmen&quot; traveled to Berlin to attend the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the trip, he visited the Reich Chancellery, where his picture was taken with Hitler. This act did not constitute an official Nazi approval for Kuhn&#x27;s organization: German Ambassador to the United States Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff expressed his disapproval and concern over the group to Berlin, causing distrust between the Bund and the Nazi regime. The organization received no financial or verbal support from Germany. In response to the outrage of Jewish war veterans, Congress in 1938 passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act requiring foreign agents to register with the State Department. On March 1, 1938, the Nazi government decreed that no &quot;Reichsdeutsche&quot; [German nationals] could be a member of the Bund, and that no Nazi emblems were to be used by the organization. This was done both to appease the U.S. and to distance Germany from the Bund, because the Bund&#x27;s rhetoric and actions were increasingly viewed as causes of embarrassment. The Bund held its sixth annual convention in early September 1938 in New York.

Arguably, the zenith of the Bund&#x27;s activities was the rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on February 20, 1939. Some 20,000 people attended and heard Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, the Bund&#x27;s National Public Relations Officer, criticize President Roosevelt by repeatedly referring to him as &quot;Frank D. Rosenfeld&quot;, calling his New Deal the &quot;Jew Deal&quot;, and denouncing what he believed to be Bolshevik-Jewish American leadership. Most shocking to American sensibilities was the outbreak of violence between protesters and Bund storm troopers. The rally was the subject of the 2017 short documentary &quot;A Night at the Garden&quot; by Marshall Curry.

===Decline===

In 1939, a New York tax investigation alleged that Kuhn had embezzled over $14,000 from the Bund (). The Bund did not seek to have Kuhn prosecuted, operating on the principle &quot;(Führerprinzip)&quot; that the leader had absolute power. However, New York City&#x27;s district attorney prosecuted him in an attempt to cripple the Bund. On December 5, 1939, Kuhn was sentenced to two and a half to five years in prison for tax evasion and embezzlement.

New Bund leaders replaced Kuhn, most notably Gerhard Kunze, but only for brief periods. The Bund&#x27;s influence significantly decreased without Kuhn. A year after the outbreak of World War II, Congress enacted a peacetime military draft in September 1940. The Bund counseled members of draft age to evade conscription, a criminal offense punishable by up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine. Gerhard Kunze fled to Mexico in November 1941. However, Mexican authorities forced him to return to the United States, where he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for espionage.

U.S. Congressman Martin Dies (D-Texas) and his House Committee on Un-American Activities were active in denying any Nazi-sympathetic organization the ability to operate freely during World War II. In the last week of December 1942, led by journalist Dorothy Thompson, fifty leading German-Americans (including baseball icon Babe Ruth) signed a &quot;Christmas Declaration by men and women of German ancestry&quot; condemning Nazism, which appeared in ten major American daily newspapers.

While Kuhn was in prison, his citizenship was canceled on June 1, 1943. Upon his release after he served 43 months in state prison, Kuhn was re-arrested on June 21, 1943, as an enemy alien and interned by the federal government at a camp in Crystal City, Texas. After the war, Kuhn was interned at Ellis Island and deported to Germany on September 15, 1945. He died on December 14, 1951, in Munich, West Germany.

According to historian Leland V. Bell, George Froboese, the Midwestern leader of the group (who had traveled to the 1936 Berlin Olympics with Kuhn to meet Hitler) and &quot;a few lesser known Bundists committed suicide,&quot; and &quot;some Bundists had their naturalizations revoked and spent a few months in detention camps&quot;. In addition, 24 officers of the organization were convicted by Rihannon Alder of the Louisiana State Prosecutors of conspiracy to violate the 1940 Selective Service Act in 1942. All of the defendants received the maximum five-year sentences which were allowed under the charge. However, they were released after their convictions were overturned in a 5–4 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in June 1945.

== Foreign relations ==

=== Relationship with Germany ===
Key members of the Bund often claimed to have a relationship with the German Nazi party in Berlin in order to legitimise the organisation in the eyes of the American public. For example, Helen Vooros, the former Bund youth leader, claimed that ‘“she was taught” that the Nazis planned an Austrian-like &quot;anschluss&quot; with the United States and ‘recognised Bund leader Fritz Kuhn as the “United States’ Fuehrer”’. Although there was never any evidence to suggest this was true, it reveals how the Bund favoured their alliance to Germany over their declaration of allegiance to “the Constitution, the flag and the institutions of the United States of America”. Despite these grand claims however, members of the Third Reich continued to discredit the Bund with the German Ambassador to the United States, Hans Heinrich Dieckhoff, voicing his disapproval of the Bund when he expressed his belief that the organisation was only serving to stir up anti-German sentiment among the American public. Due to this conflicting relationship, Germany distanced themselves from the Bund as they saw them as being untrustworthy and detrimental to German-American relations. On the 1st of March 1938 the Nazi government declared that no German citizen could be a member of the German-American Bund and, no Nazi emblems or symbols were to be used in association with this organisation.

=== Relationship with America ===
Meanwhile, in America, there was a growing fear that the Bund was working with Germany to spark a fascist revolution in the States. American newspapers rallied fear surrounding the organisation by creating no distinction between the Nazi party and the German-American Bund. In the aftermath of the 1939 rally in Madison Square Garden, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that the Bund was “determined to destroy our democracy and to establish in its place a fascist dictatorship”. Statements such as this promoted a genuine fear of the reach of German Fascism in America and incentivised a widespread anti-German sentiment across the country, especially when followed by accounts of everyday Americans joining the Bund as seen in both &quot;The Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Despite its original goal of garnering sympathy for the Nazi party in America, the Bund was a leading contributor to the hatred of National Socialists in the States. Due to the antisemitic teachings and pro-Hitler stance, the Bund became marginalised from American society and became an aid to the Roosevelt administration in promoting the detrimental effect of National Socialism on American society.

=== Impact on German-American Relations ===
In the 1930s, the Bund amplified the anti-German feeling which lingered in the American public&#x27;s consciousness and as a result, Americans believed that the Bund posed a threat to their way of life. Political leaders such as Roosevelt recognised the threat which the Nazi ideology posed to the West and they used the American people&#x27;s fear of the Bund as a helpful tool in support of their efforts to steer the American people towards the possibility of war. Fear of Nazi ideology triggered tensions between Germany and America because the American public had strong feelings against the Nazi regime due to its experiences with the Bund, feelings which were amplified by the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Therefore, the American public supported the war effort in an attempt to protect its freedom, ultimately leading to a break in German-American relations when Nazi Germany declared war against the United States on December 11, 1941, four days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

<doc id="312489" wikidata="Q245395" url="?curid=312489" title="Pangu">
<text>Pangu or Pan Gu
(, ) is a primordial being and creation figure in Chinese mythology and in Taoism. According to legend, Pangu separated heaven and earth, and his body later became geographic features such as mountains and roaring water.

==Legend==
The first writer to record the myth of Pangu was thought to be Xu Zheng during the Three Kingdoms period. However, his name was found in a tomb predating the Three Kingdoms period.

In the beginning, there was nothing and the universe was in a featureless, formless primordial state. This primordial state coalesced into a cosmic egg for about 18,000 years. Within it, the perfectly opposed principles of yin and yang became balanced and Pangu emerged (or woke up) from the egg. Pangu inside the cosmic egg symbolizes Taiji. Pangu is usually depicted as a primitive, hairy giant with horns on his head. Pangu began creating the world: he separated yin from yang with a swing of his giant axe, creating the earth (murky &quot;yin&quot;) and the sky (clear &quot;yang&quot;). To keep them separated, Pangu stood between them and pushed up the sky. With each day, the sky grew ten feet (3 meters) higher, the earth ten feet thicker, and Pangu ten feet taller. This task took yet another 18,000 years.

In some versions of the story, Pangu is aided in this task by the Four Holy Beasts (四靈獸), the Turtle, the Qilin, the Phoenix, and the Dragon. In others, Pangu separated heaven and earth, which were already &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot;, with his axe.

After the 18,000 years had elapsed, Pangu died. His breath became the wind, mist and clouds; his voice, thunder; his left eye, the Sun; his right eye, the Moon; his head, the mountains and extremes of the world; his blood, rivers; his muscles, fertile land; his facial hair, the stars and Milky Way; his fur, bushes and forests; his bones, valuable minerals; his bone marrow, precious jewels; his sweat, rain; and the fleas on his fur carried by the wind became animals.

In other versions of the story, his body turned into the mountains.

==Origin==
Three main elements describe the origin of the Pangu myth. The first is that the story is indigenous and was developed or transmitted through time to Xu Zheng. Senior Scholar Wei Juxian states that the Pangu story is derived from stories during the Western Zhou dynasty. He cites the story of Zhong () and Li () in the &quot;Chuyu (楚語)&quot; section of the ancient classics &quot;Guoyu&quot;. In it, King Zhao of Chu asked Guanshefu () a question: &quot;What did the ancient classic &quot;Zhou Shu (周書)&quot; mean by the sentence that Zhong and Li caused the heaven and earth to disconnect from each other?&quot; The &quot;Zhou Shu&quot; sentence he refers to is about an earlier person, Luu Xing (呂刑), who converses with King Mu of Zhou. King Mu&#x27;s reign is much earlier and dates to about 1001 to 946 BC. In their conversation, they discuss a &quot;disconnection&quot; between heaven and earth.

Derk Bodde linked the myth to the ancestral mythologies of the Miao people and Yao people in southern China.

This is how Professor Qin Naichang (覃乃昌), head of the Guangxi Institute for Nationality Studies, reconstructs the true creation myth preceding the myth of Pangu. Note that it is not actually a creation myth:

A brother and his sister became the only survivors of the prehistoric Deluge by crouching in a gourd that floated on water. The two got married afterwards, and a mass of flesh in the shape of a whetstone was born. They chopped it and the pieces turned into large crowds of people, who began to reproduce again. The couple were named &#x27;Pan&#x27; and &#x27;Gou&#x27; in the Zhuang ethnic language, which stand for whetstone and gourd respectively.

19th-century comparative religion scholar Paul Carus writes:
P&#x27;an-Gu: The basic idea of the yih philosophy was so convincing that it almost obliterated the Taoist cosmology of P&#x27;an-Ku who is said to have chiseled the world out of the rocks of eternity. Though the legend is not held in high honor by the literati, it contains some features of interest which have not as yet been pointed out and deserve at least an incidental comment.

P&#x27;an-Gu is written in two ways: one means in literal translations, &quot;basin ancient&quot;, the other &quot;basin solid&quot;. Both are homophones, i.e., they are pronounced the same way; and the former may be preferred as the original and correct spelling. Obviously the name means &quot;aboriginal abyss,&quot; or in the terser German, Urgrund, and we have reason to believe it to be a translation of the Babylonian Tiamat, &quot;the Deep.&quot;

The Chinese legend tells us that P&#x27;an-Ku&#x27;s bones changed to rocks; his flesh to earth; his marrow, teeth and nails to metals; his hair to herbs and trees; his veins to rivers; his breath to wind; and his four limbs became pillars marking the four corners of the world, which is a Chinese version not only of the Norse myth of the Giant Ymir, but also of the Babylonian story of Tiamat.

Illustrations of P&#x27;an-Ku represent him in the company of supernatural animals that symbolize old age or immortality, viz., the tortoise and the crane; sometimes also the dragon, the emblem of power, and the phoenix, the emblem of bliss.

When the earth had thus been shaped from the body of P&#x27;an-Ku, we are told that three great rivers successively governed the world: first the celestial, then the terrestrial, and finally the human sovereign. They were followed by Yung-Ch&#x27;eng and Sui -Jen (i.e., fire-man) the later being the Chinese Prometheus, who brought the fire down from heaven and taught man its various uses.

The Prometheus myth is not indigenous to Greece, where it received the artistically classical form under which it is best known to us. The name, which by an ingenious afterthought is explained as &quot;the fore thinker,&quot; is originally the Sanskrit pramantha and means &quot;twirler&quot; or &quot;fire-stick,&quot; being the rod of hard wood which produced fire by rapid rotation in a piece of soft wood.

We cannot deny that the myth must have been known also in Mesopotamia, the main center of civilization between India and Greece, and it becomes probable that the figure Sui-Jen has been derived from the same prototype as the Greek Prometheus.
The missionary and translator James Legge discusses Pangu:
P&#x27;an-ku is spoken of by the common people as &quot;the first man, who opened up heaven and earth.&quot; It has been said to me in &quot;pidgin&quot; English that &quot;he is all the same your Adam&quot;; and in Taoist picture books I have seen him as a shaggy, dwarfish, Hercules, developing from a bear rather than an ape, and wielding an immense hammer and chisel with which he is breaking the chaotic rocks.
==Other Chinese creation myths==
The Pangu myth appears to have been preceded in ancient Chinese literature by the existence of Shangdi or Taiyi (of the &quot;Taiyi Shengshui&quot;). Other Chinese myths, such as those of Nüwa and the Jade Emperor, try to explain how people were created and do not necessarily explain the creation of the world. There are many variations of these myths.

==In Bouyei culture==

According to Bouyei mythology, after Pangu became an expert in rice farming after creating the world, he married the daughter of the Dragon King, and their union gave rise to the Buyei people. This is celebrated by the Bouyei people on June 6, as a holiday.

The daughter of the Dragon King and Pangu had a son named Xinheng (). When Xinheng disrespected his mother, she returned to heaven and never came down, despite the repeated pleas of her husband and son. Pangu was forced to remarry and eventually died on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar.

Xinheng&#x27;s stepmother treated him badly and almost killed him. When Xinheng threatened to destroy her rice harvest, she realized her mistake. She made peace with him and they went on to pay their respects to Pangu annually on the sixth day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar. This day became an important traditional Buyei holiday for ancestral worship.

This legend of creation is one of the main characteristics that distinguishes the Buyei from the Zhuang.

==Worship==
Pangu is worshipped at a number of shrines in contemporary China, usually with Taoist symbols, such as the Bagua.

The Pangu King Temple ( or ) built in 1809 is located in Guangdong Province, northwest Huadu District (west of G106 / north of S118), north of Shiling Town at the foot of the Pangu King Mountain. The Huadu District is located north of Guangzhou to the west of the Baiyun International Airport.

The term for the primordial supercontinent pangea is translated as Pangu in Chinese, referring to the creation myth.

<text>André-Aimé-René Masson (4 January 1896 – 28 October 1987) was a French artist.

==Biography==

Masson was born in Balagny-sur-Thérain, Oise, but when he was eight his father&#x27;s work took the family first briefly to Lille and then to Brussels. He began his study of art at the age of eleven at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, under the guidance of Constant Montald, and later he studied in Paris. He fought for France during World War I and was seriously injured.
Masson shared a Paris studio with Joan Miró.

==Artistic works==
His early works display an interest in cubism. He later became associated with surrealism, and he was one of the most enthusiastic employers of automatic drawing, making a number of automatic works in pen and ink. Masson experimented with altered states of consciousness with artists such as Antonin Artaud, Michel Leiris, Joan Miró, Georges Bataille, Jean Dubuffet and Georges Malkine, who were neighbors of his studio in Paris.

From around 1926 he experimented by throwing sand and glue onto canvas and making oil paintings based around the shapes that formed. By the end of the 1920s, however, he was finding automatic drawing rather restricting, and he left the surrealist movement and turned instead to a more structured style, often producing works with a violent or erotic theme. In 1932 he married his lover Paule Vézelay, a British abstract artist living in Paris, whose work also inspired him. He was living in Tossa de Mar, a small fishing village on the Costa Brava, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, which is reflected in a number of his paintings (he associated once more with the surrealists at the end of the 1930s).

Under the German occupation of France during World War II, his work was condemned by the Nazis as degenerate. With the assistance of Varian Fry in Marseille, Masson escaped the Nazi regime on a ship to the French island of Martinique from where he went on to the United States. Upon arrival in New York City customs officials inspecting Masson&#x27;s luggage found a cache of his erotic drawings. Living in New Preston, Connecticut, his work became an important influence on American abstract expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock. Following the war, he returned to France and settled in Aix-en-Provence where he painted a number of landscapes.

Masson drew the cover of the first issue of Georges Bataille&#x27;s review, &quot;Acéphale&quot;, in 1936, and participated in all its issues until 1939. His brother-in-law, the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, was the last private owner of Gustave Courbet&#x27;s provocative painting &quot;L&#x27;Origine du monde&quot; (&quot;The Origin of the World&quot;); Lacan asked Masson to paint a surrealist variant.

==Family==

His son, Diego Masson (born 1935), is a conductor, composer, and percussionist, while another son, Luis Masson, is an actor. His daughter, Lily Masson (1920–2019), was a painter.

<doc id="312498" wikidata="Q20475" url="?curid=312498" title="Yojimbo">
<text>is a 1961 Japanese samurai film directed by Akira Kurosawa, who also co-wrote the screenplay and was one of the producers. The film stars Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoko Tsukasa, Isuzu Yamada, Daisuke Katō, Takashi Shimura, Kamatari Fujiwara, and Atsushi Watanabe. In the film, a &quot;rōnin&quot; arrives in a small town where competing crime lords fight for supremacy. The two bosses each try to hire the newcomer as a bodyguard.

Based on the success of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, Kurosawa&#x27;s next film, &quot;Sanjuro&quot; (1962), was altered to incorporate the lead character of this film. In both films, the character wears a rather dilapidated dark kimono bearing the same family &quot;mon&quot;.

The film was released and produced by Toho on April 25, 1961. &quot;Yojimbo&quot; received highly positive reviews, and, over the years, became widely regarded as one of the best films by Kurosawa and one of the greatest films ever made. The film grossed an estimated US$2.5 million worldwide with a budget of ¥90.87 million ($631,000). It was unofficially remade by Sergio Leone as the Spaghetti Western film &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964), leading to a lawsuit by Toho.

==Plot==
In 1860, during the final years of the Edo period, a &quot;rōnin&quot; wanders through a desolate countryside. Coming to a fork in the road, he chooses which path to take at random.

Stopping at a farmhouse for water, the rōnin overhears an elderly couple lamenting that their only son has run off to join the &quot;gamblers&quot; in a nearby town, which is overrun with criminals and contested by two rival yakuza gangs.

In the town, the rōnin stops at a small &quot;izakaya&quot; (tavern). The owner Gonji advises him to leave. Gonji tells the rōnin that the two warring bosses, Ushitora and Seibei, are fighting over the lucrative gambling trade run by Seibei. Ushitora had been Seibei&#x27;s right-hand man until Seibei decided that his successor would be his son Yoichiro, a useless youth. The town&#x27;s mayor, a silk merchant named Tazaemon, had long been in Seibei&#x27;s pocket, so Ushitora aligned himself with the local sake brewer, Tokuemon, proclaiming him the new mayor.

After sizing up the situation and recognizing that no one in town cares about ending the violence, the stranger says he intends to stay, as the town would be better off with both sides dead. He convinces the weaker Seibei to hire his services by effortlessly killing three of Ushitora&#x27;s men. When asked his name, he sees a mulberry field and states his name is Kuwabatake (&quot;mulberry field&quot;) Sanjuro (&quot;thirty-years-old&quot;) ().

Seibei decides that with the ronin&#x27;s help, it is time to deal with Ushitora. Sanjuro eavesdrops on Seibei&#x27;s wife, who orders Yoichiro to prove himself by killing the ronin after the upcoming raid, saving them from having to pay him. Sanjuro leads the attack on Ushitora&#x27;s faction, but then &quot;resigns&quot; over Seibei&#x27;s treachery, expecting both sides to massacre each other. His plan is foiled due to the unexpected arrival of a &quot;bugyō&quot; (a government official), which prompts both Seibei and Ushitora to make a bloodless retreat.
The &quot;bugyō&quot; leaves soon after to investigate the assassination of a fellow official in another town. Overhearing the assassins discussing the hit in Gonji&#x27;s tavern, Sanjuro later captures them and sells them to Seibei. Then he comes to Ushitora and tells him Seibei&#x27;s men caught the assassins. Alarmed, Ushitora generously rewards Sanjuro for his &quot;help,&quot; and kidnaps Yoichiro to exchange for the two assassins. At the swap, Ushitora&#x27;s brother Unosuke kills the assassins with a pistol. 

Anticipating this, Seibei reveals he had ordered the kidnapping of Tokuemon’s mistress. The next morning, she is exchanged for Yoichiro. Sanjuro learns that the mistress, Nui, is a local farmer&#x27;s wife. After he sold her to Ushitora to settle a gambling debt, Ushitora gave her to Tokuemon as chattel to gain his support. After tricking Ushitora into revealing where Nui is held, Sanjuro kills the guards and reunites the woman with her husband and son, ordering them to leave town immediately. He comes to Ushitora and informs him that Seibei is responsible for killing his men. 

The gang war escalates, with Ushitora burning down Tazaemon&#x27;s silk warehouse and Seibei retaliating by trashing Tokuemon&#x27;s brewery. After some time, Unosuke becomes suspicious of Sanjuro and the circumstances surrounding Nui&#x27;s escape, eventually uncovering evidence of the ronin&#x27;s betrayal. Sanjuro is severely beaten and imprisoned by Ushitora&#x27;s thugs, who torture him to find out Nui&#x27;s whereabouts.

When Ushitora decides to eliminate Seibei once and for all, Sanjuro escapes. Smuggled out of town in a coffin by Gonji, Sanjuro witnesses the brutal end of Seibei and his family. Sanjuro recuperates in a small temple near a cemetery. 

Upon learning Gonji has been captured by Ushitora, he returns to town. In a final confrontation with Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang, Sanjuro dispatches them. He spares a terrified young man (the son of the elderly couple from the opening of the film) and sends him back to his parents. As Sanjuro surveys the damage, a now insane Tazaemon comes out of his home in a samurai outfit and stabs Tokuemon to death. Sanjuro frees Gonji, proclaims that the town will be quiet from then on, and departs.

==Production==

===Writing===
Kurosawa stated that a major source for the plot was the 1942 film noir classic &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, an adaptation of Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s 1931 novel of the same name. It has been noted that the overall plot of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; is closer to that of another Hammett novel, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929). Kurosawa scholar David Desser, and film critic Manny Farber claim that &quot;Red Harvest&quot; was the inspiration for the film; however, Donald Richie and other scholars believe the similarities are coincidental.

When asked his name, the samurai calls himself &quot;Kuwabatake Sanjuro&quot;, which he seems to make up while looking at a mulberry field by the town. Thus, the character can be viewed as an early example of the &quot;Man with No Name&quot; (other examples of which appear in several earlier novels, including Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;Red Harvest&quot;).

===Casting===
Many of the actors in &quot;Yojimbo&quot; worked with Kurosawa before and after, especially Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura and Tatsuya Nakadai.

===Filming===
After Kurosawa scolded Mifune for arriving late to the set one morning; Mifune made it a point to be ready on set at 6:00 AM every day in full makeup and costume for the rest of the film&#x27;s shooting schedule.

This was the second film where director Akira Kurosawa worked with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa (the first being &quot;Rashomon&quot; in 1950).
The sword instruction and choreography for the film were done by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū and Ryū Kuze.

===Music===
The soundtrack for the film has received positive reviews. Michael Wood writing retrospectively for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; found the film&#x27;s soundtrack by Masaru Sato as effective in its &#x27;jaunty and jangling&#x27; approach stating:

The film is full of music, for instance, a loud, witty soundtrack by Masaru Sato, who said his main influence was Henry Mancini. It doesn’t sound like Breakfast at Tiffany’s, though, or Days of Wine and Roses. The blaring Latin sound of Touch of Evil comes closer, but actually you wouldn’t think of Mancini if you hadn’t been told. Sato’s effect has lots of drums, mixes traditional Japanese flutes and other instruments with American big band noises, and feels jaunty and jangling throughout, discreetly off, as if half the band was playing in the wrong key. It’s distracting at first, then you realise it’s not decoration, it’s commentary. It’s a companion to Sanjuro, the sound of his mind, discordant and undefeated and unserious, even when he’s grubby and silent and apparently solemn.

==Release==
&quot;Yojimbo&quot; was released in Japan on 25 April 1961. The film was released by Seneca International in both a subtitled and dubbed format in the United States in September 1961.

===Box office===
&quot;Yojimbo&quot; was Japan&#x27;s fourth highest-grossing film of 1961, earning a distribution rental income of . This was equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately ().

Overseas, the film had a September 1961 release in North America, but the box office income of this release is currently unknown. At the 2002 Kurosawa &amp; Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692. In South Korea, a 2012 re-release grossed ().

In Europe, a January 1991 limited French re-release sold 14,178 tickets, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately ($87,934). Other limited European re-releases sold 3,392 tickets between 2000 and 2018, equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of at least (). This adds up to an estimated grossed overseas, and an estimated grossed worldwide.

Adjusted for ticket price inflation, at 2012 Japanese ticket prices, its Japanese gross receipts are equivalent to an estimated (), or adjusted for inflation in . The overseas gross revenue of North American and European re-releases since 1991 are equivalent to approximately adjusted for inflation, adding up to an estimated inflation-adjusted total gross of over worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Yojimbo&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design at the 34th Academy Awards. Toshiro Mifune won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the 22nd Venice Film Festival. 

A 1968 screening in the planned community of Columbia, Maryland was considered too violent for viewers, causing the hosts to hide in the bathroom to avoid the audience. 

In a retrospective look at the film Michael Wood writing for the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; found the film to span several genres and compared it to other western and samurai films from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, such as &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, and &quot;Rashomon&quot;, stating, &quot;(The film contains) comedy, satire, folk tale, action movie, Western, samurai film, and something like a musical without songs. As everyone says, this work is not as deep as &quot;Rashomon&quot; or as immediately memorable as &quot;Seven Samurai.&quot; But it is funnier than any Western from either side of the world, and its only competition, in a bleaker mode, would be Clint Eastwood’s &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976).&quot; In 2009 the film was voted at No. 23 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. &quot;Yojimbo&quot; was also ranked at #95 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Films of All Time&quot;.

==Sequel==

In 1962, Kurosawa directed &quot;Sanjuro&quot;, originally intended to be a straight adaptation of Shūgorō Yamamoto&#x27;s short story , but was reworked to include Mifune and his character following the success of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

In both films, he takes his surname from the plants he happens to be looking at when asked his name: in &quot;Yojimbo&quot; it is the mulberry trees that feed the town&#x27;s silkworms, and in &quot;Sanjuro&quot; it is camellia bushes used to make tea.

==Legacy==

Both in Japan and in the West, &quot;Yojimbo&quot; has influenced various forms of entertainment, starting with a remake as &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; (1964), a Spaghetti Western directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first appearance as the Man with No Name. That film was followed by two prequels. The three films are collectively known as the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;. Leone and his production company failed to secure the remake rights to Kurosawa&#x27;s film, resulting in a lawsuit that delayed &quot;Fistful&quot;″s release in North America for three years. It was settled out of court for an undisclosed agreement before the U.S. release. In &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, the protagonist defeats a man who carries a gun, while he carries only a knife and a sword; in the equivalent scene in &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, Eastwood&#x27;s pistol-wielding character survives being shot by a rifle by hiding an iron plate under his clothes to serve as a shield against bullets.

A second, looser Spaghetti Western adaptation, &quot;Django&quot; (1966), was directed by Sergio Corbucci and featured Franco Nero in the title role. Known for its high level (at the time of its release) of graphic violence, the film&#x27;s character and title were referenced in two official films (a sequel and prequel) and over thirty unofficial ones.

The film &quot;Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo&quot; (1970) features Mifune as a somewhat similar character. It is the twentieth of a series of movies featuring the blind swordsman Zatoichi. Although Mifune is clearly not playing the same &quot;Yojimbo&quot; as he did in the two Kurosawa films (his name is Sasa Daisaku , and his personality and background are different in many key respects), the movie&#x27;s title and some of its content do intend to suggest the image of the two iconic &quot;jidaigeki&quot; characters confronting each other.
&quot;Incident at Blood Pass&quot; (1970), made the same year, stars Mifune as a ronin who looks and acts even more similarly to Sanjuro and is referred to simply as &quot;Yojimbo&quot; throughout the film, but whose name is Shinogi Tōzaburō. As was the case with &quot;Sanjuro&quot;, this character&#x27;s surname of &quot;Shinogi&quot; () is not an actual proper family name, but rather a term that means &quot;ridges on a blade&quot;.

Mifune&#x27;s character became the model for John Belushi&#x27;s Samurai Futaba character on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

&quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; (1977) pays narrative and visual homage to &quot;Yojimbo&quot; during the cantina scene early in the film. When Luke Skywalker approaches the bar, he is accosted by Ponda Baba and Doctor Evazan, who like the gamblers confronting Sanjuro inform him of serious criminal penalties they have received elsewhere (death sentences in 12 jurisdictions) to intimidate him. Obi-Wan Kenobi intervenes just as they threaten Luke&#x27;s life, and after he briefly wields his lightsaber the camera likewise shows a severed forearm on the floor to demonstrate the character&#x27;s prowess with the weapon.

Similarly, &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017) was also heavily influenced by &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. In the film&#x27;s third act, Luke Skywalker&#x27;s attire is visually reminiscent of that of Sanjuro&#x27;s, both characters are also framed in Wide shot and are portrayed as &quot;lone heroes&quot; with both having to deal with a larger threat by themselves, Sanjuro confronts Ushitora, Unosuke, and their gang while Luke confronts the entire First Order. During his showdown with Kylo Ren, Luke&#x27;s last line is &quot;See you around, kid&quot;, which recalls Sanjuro&#x27;s last line, &quot;Aba yo&quot;, meaning &quot;See you around&quot;.

James Bond screenwriter Michael G. Wilson compared the writing of Licence to Kill to Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, where a samurai &quot;without any attacking of the villain or its cohorts, only sowing the seeds of distrust, he manages to have the villain bring himself down&quot;.

&quot;The Warrior and the Sorceress&quot; (1984) is another retelling of the story, this one in a fantasy world.

&quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (1996) is a Prohibition-era action film directed by Walter Hill and starring Bruce Willis. It is an official remake of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; with both Kikushima and Kurosawa specifically listed in this movie&#x27;s credits as having provided the original story.

At the closing of Episode XXIII (S02E10) of the animated series &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; (2002; S02), a triumphant Jack walks off alone in a scene (and accompanied by music) influenced by the closing scene and music of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;. In Episode XXVI (S02E13), Jack confronts a gang who destroyed his sandals, using Clint Eastwood&#x27;s lines from &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, but substituting &quot;footwear&quot; for &quot;mule&quot;. The influence of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; in particular (and Kurosawa films in general) on the animated series has been noted by Matthew Millheiser at DVDtalk.

&quot;Inferno&quot; (1999) (aka &quot;Desert Heat&quot;) is a remake and an homage to &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

Stan Sakai&#x27;s comic-book series Usagi Yojimbo (since 1984) is inspired by Kurosawa&#x27;s movies.

<doc id="312501" wikidata="Q80095" url="?curid=312501" title="Kenzaburō Ōe">
<text>was a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary Japanese literature. His novels, short stories and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and literary theory, deal with political, social and philosophical issues, including nuclear weapons, nuclear power, social non-conformism, and existentialism. Ōe was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Literature for creating &quot;an imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ōe was born in , a village now in Uchiko, Ehime Prefecture, on Shikoku. The third of seven children, he grew up listening to his grandmother, a storyteller of myths and folklore, who also recounted the oral history of the two uprisings in the region before and after the Meiji Restoration. His father, Kōtare Ōe, had a bark-stripping business; the bark was used to make paper currency. After his father died in the Pacific War in 1944, his mother, Koseki, became the driving force behind his education, buying him books including &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Adventures of Nils&quot;, which had a formative influence on him.

Ōe received the first ten years of his education in local public schools. He started school during the peak of militarism in Japan; in class, he was forced to pronounce his loyalty to Emperor Hirohito, who his teacher claimed was a god. After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing.

Ōe attended high school in Matsuyama from 1951 to 1953, where he excelled as a student. At the age of 18, he made his first trip to Tokyo, where he studied at a prep school (&quot;yobikō&quot;) for one year. The following year, he began studying French Literature at the University of Tokyo with Professor Kazuo Watanabe, a specialist on François Rabelais.

== Career ==
Ōe began publishing stories in 1957, while still a student, strongly influenced by contemporary writing in France and the United States. He was particularly influenced by the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre His first work to be published was &quot;Lavish are the Dead&quot;, a short story set in Tokyo during the American occupation, which appeared in &quot;Bungakukai&quot; literary magazine. His early works were set in his own university milieu.

In 1958, his short story &quot;Shiiku&quot; (飼育) was awarded the prestigious Akutagawa Prize. The work was about a black GI set upon by Japanese youth, and was later made into a film, &quot;The Catch&quot; by Nagisa Oshima in 1961. Another early novella, later translated as &quot;Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids&quot;, focused on young children living in Arcadian transformations of Ōe&#x27;s own rural Shikoku childhood. Ōe identified these child figures as belonging to the &#x27;child god&#x27; archetype of Jung and Kerényi, which is characterised by abandonment, hermaphrodism, invincibility, and association with beginning and end. The first two characteristics are present in these early stories, while the latter two features come to the fore in the &#x27;idiot boy&#x27; stories which appeared after the birth of his son Hikari. 

Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe published a series of works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as &quot;the relationship of a foreigner as the big power [Z], a Japanese who is more or less placed in a humiliating position [X], and, sandwiched between the two, the third party [Y] (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)&quot;. In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development. The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series &quot;Our Times&quot;, &quot;I personally like this novel [because] I do not think I will ever write another novel which is filled only with sexual words.&quot;

In 1961, Ōe&#x27;s novellas &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;The Death of a Political Youth&quot; were published in the Japanese literary magazine &quot;Bungakukai&quot;. Both were inspired by seventeen-year-old Yamaguchi Otoya, who had assassinated Japan Socialist Party chairman Inejirō Asanuma in October 1960, and then killed himself in prison three weeks later. Yamaguchi had admirers among the extreme right wing who were angered by &quot;The Death of a Political Youth&quot; and both Ōe and the magazine received death threats day and night for weeks. The magazine soon apologized to offended readers, but Ōe did not, and he was later physically assaulted by an angry right-winger while giving a speech at the University of Tokyo.

Ōe&#x27;s next phase moved away from sexual content, shifting this time toward the violent fringes of society. The works which he published between 1961 and 1964 are influenced by existentialism and picaresque literature, populated with more or less criminal rogues and anti-heroes whose position on the fringes of society allows them to make pointed criticisms of it. Ōe&#x27;s admission that Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is his favorite book can be said to find a context in this period.

===Influence of Hikari===

Ōe credited his son Hikari for influencing his literary career. Ōe tried to give his son a &quot;voice&quot; through his writing. Several of Ōe&#x27;s books feature a character based on his son.

In Ōe&#x27;s 1964 book, &quot;A Personal Matter&quot;, the writer describes the psychological trauma involved in accepting his brain-damaged son into his life. Hikari figures prominently in many of the books singled out for praise by the Nobel committee, and his life is the core of the first book published after Ōe was awarded the Nobel Prize. The 1996 book, &quot;A Healing Family,&quot; is a memoir written as a collection of essays.

===2006 to 2008===
In 2005, two retired Japanese military officers sued Ōe for libel for his 1970 book of essays, &quot;Okinawa Notes&quot;, in which he had written that members of the Japanese military had coerced masses of Okinawan civilians into committing suicide during the Allied invasion of the island in 1945. In March 2008, the Osaka District Court dismissed all charges against Ōe. In this ruling, Judge Toshimasa Fukami stated, &quot;The military was deeply involved in the mass suicides&quot;. In a news conference following the trial, Ōe said, &quot;The judge accurately read my writing.&quot;

Ōe did not write much during the nearly two years (2006–2008) of his libel case. He began writing a new novel, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported would feature a character &quot;based on his father,&quot; a staunch supporter of the imperial system who drowned in a flood during World War II. &quot;Death by Water&quot; was published in 2009.

===2013===
&quot;Bannen Yoshikishu&quot;, his final novel, is the sixth in a series with the main character of Kogito Choko, who can be considered Ōe&#x27;s literary alter ego. The novel is also in a sense a culmination of the I-novels that Ōe continued to write since his son was born mentally disabled in 1963. In the novel, Choko loses interest in the novel he had been writing when the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami struck the Tohoku region on 11 March 2011. Instead, he begins writing about an age of catastrophe, as well as about the fact that he himself was approaching his late 70s.

== Activism ==
In 1959 and 1960, Ōe participated in the Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty as a member of a group of young writers, artists, and composers called the &quot;Young Japan Society&quot; (&quot;Wakai Nihon no Kai&quot;). The treaty allowed the United States to maintain military bases in Japan, and Ōe&#x27;s disappointment at the failure of the protests to stop the treaty shaped his future writing.
Ōe was involved with pacifist and anti-nuclear campaigns and wrote books regarding the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Hibakusha. After meeting prominent American anti-nuclear activist Noam Chomsky at a Harvard degree ceremony, Ōe began his correspondence with Chomsky by sending him a copy of his &quot;Okinawa Notes&quot;. While also discussing Ōe&#x27;s &quot;Okinawa Notes&quot;, Chomsky&#x27;s reply included a story from his childhood. Chomsky wrote that when he first heard about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, he could not bear it being celebrated, and he went in the woods and sat alone until the evening. Ōe later said in an interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve always respected Chomsky, but I respected him even more after he told me that.&quot;

In a 2007 interview with The Paris Review, Ōe described himself as an anarchist. Stating: &quot;In principle, I am an anarchist. Kurt Vonnegut once said he was an agnostic who respects Jesus Christ. I am an anarchist who loves democracy.&quot;

Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, he urged Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to &quot;halt plans to restart nuclear power plants and instead abandon nuclear energy&quot;. Ōe said Japan has an &quot;ethical responsibility&quot; to abandon nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, just as it renounced war under its postwar Constitution. He called for &quot;an immediate end to nuclear power generation and warned that Japan would suffer another nuclear catastrophe if it tries to resume nuclear power plant operations&quot;. In 2013, he organized a mass demonstration in Tokyo against nuclear power. Ōe also criticized moves to amend Article 9 of the Constitution, which forever renounces war.

In 2015, Ōe stated that he believed that the Japanese government had not adequately acknowledged or apologized for the comfort women issue.

== Personal life and death ==
Ōe married in February 1960. His wife, Yukari, was the daughter of film director Mansaku Itami and sister of film director Juzo Itami. The same year he met Mao Zedong on a trip to China. He also went to Russia and Europe the following year, visiting Sartre in Paris.

Ōe lived in Tokyo and had three children. In 1963, his eldest son, Hikari, was born with a brain hernia. Ōe initially struggled to accept his son&#x27;s condition, which required surgery which would leave him with learning disabilities for life. Hikari lived with Kenzaburō and Yukari until he was middle-aged, and often composed music in the same room where his father was writing.

Ōe died on 3 March 2023 at the age of 88, reportedly due to old age.

==Honors==

=== Nobel Prize in Literature and Japan&#x27;s Order of Culture ===
In 1994 Ōe won the Nobel Prize in Literature and was named to receive Japan&#x27;s Order of Culture. He refused the latter because it is bestowed by the Emperor. Ōe said, &quot;I do not recognize any authority, any value, higher than democracy.&quot; Once again, he received threats.

Shortly after learning that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize, Ōe said that he was encouraged by the Swedish Academy&#x27;s recognition of modern Japanese literature, and hoped that it would inspire other writers. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his writing was ultimately focused on &quot;the dignity of human beings.&quot;

=== Major awards ===
*Tokyo University May Festival Prize, 1957.
*Akutagawa Prize, 1958.

=== Eponymous literary prize ===
In 2005, the Kenzaburō Ōe Prize was established by publisher Kodansha to promote Japanese literary novels internationally, with the first prize awarded in 2007. The winning work was selected solely by Ōe, to be translated into English, French, or German, and published worldwide.

==Selected works==
The number of Kenzaburō Ōe&#x27;s works translated into English and other languages remains limited, so that much of his literary output is still only available in Japanese. The few translations have often appeared after a marked lag in time. Works of his have also been translated into Chinese, French, and German.

<doc id="312505" wikidata="Q269285" url="?curid=312505" title="Teti">
<text>Teti, less commonly known as Othoes, sometimes also Tata, Atat, or Athath in outdated sources (died 2333 BC), was the first king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. He was buried at Saqqara. The exact length of his reign has been destroyed on the Turin King List but is believed to have been around 12 years.

==Biography==
Teti had several wives: 
*Iput, the daughter of Unas, the last king of the Fifth dynasty. Iput was the mother of Pepi I.
*Khuit, who may have been the mother of Userkare (according to Jonosi and Callender)
*Khentkaus IV
*Naert

Teti is known to have had several children. He was the father of at least three sons and probably ten daughters. Of the sons, two are well attested, a third one is likely:
* Pepi I
* Tetiankhkem
* Nebkauhor, with the name of Idu, &quot;king&#x27;s eldest son of his body&quot;, buried in the mastaba of Vizier Akhethetep/Hemi, buried in a fallen Vizier&#x27;s tomb, within the funerary complex of his maternal grandfather

According to N. Kanawati, Teti had at least nine daughters, by a number of wives, and the fact that they were named after his mother, Sesheshet, allows researchers to trace his family. At least three princesses bearing the name Seshseshet are designated as &quot;king&#x27;s eldest daughter&quot;, meaning that there were at least three different queens. It seems that there was a tenth one, born of a fourth queen as she is also designated as &quot;king&#x27;s eldest daughter&quot;:
* Seshseshet, whose name was Waatetkhéthor, married to Vizier Mereruka, in whose mastaba she has a chapel. She is designated as &quot;king&#x27;s eldest daughter of his body&quot;. She may have been the eldest daughter of Iput.
* Seshseshet with the name of Idut, &quot;king&#x27;s daughter of his body&quot;, who died very young at the beginning of her father&#x27;s reign and was buried in the mastaba of Vizier Ihy.
* Seshseshet Nubkhetnebty, &quot;king&#x27;s daughter of his body&quot;, wife of Vizier Kagemni, represented in her husband&#x27;s mastaba. She was maybe also born of Iput.
* Seshseshet, also called Sathor, married to Isi, resident governor at Edfu and also titled vizier. She also would have been born of Iput I.
* Seshseshet, with the name of Sheshit, king&#x27;s eldest daughter of his body and wife of the overseer of the great court Neferseshemptah and is depicted in her husband&#x27;s mastaba. As she is an eldest daughter of the king, she cannot be born of the same mother as Waatkhetethor and therefore may have been a daughter of Queen Khuit.
* Seshseshet also called Sheshti, &quot;king&#x27;s daughter of his body&quot;, married to the keeper of the head ornaments Shepsipuptah, and depicted in her husband&#x27;s mastaba.
* Seshseshet with the beautiful name of Merout, entitled &quot;king&#x27;s eldest daughter&quot; but without the addition &quot;of his body&quot; and therefore born of a third, maybe a minor queen, and married to Ptahemhat.
* Seshseshet, wife of Remni, &quot;sole companion&quot; and overseer of the department of the palace guards
* Seshseshet, married to Pepyankh Senior of Meir
*The so-called &quot;Queen of the West Pyramid&quot; in King Pepy I cemetery. She is called &quot;king&#x27;s eldest daughter of his body&quot; and king&#x27;s wife of Meryre (the name of Pepy I). Therefore, she is a wife of Pepi and most certainly his half-sister. As she is also an eldest daughter of the king, her mother must be a fourth queen of Teti.

Another possible daughter is princess Inti.

==Reign and possible assassination==

Teti&#x27;s Horus name &quot;Sehoteptaoui&quot;, &quot;He who pacifies the Two Lands&quot;, probably indicates that he must have led military pacification operations near the start of his reign. During Teti&#x27;s reign, high officials were beginning to build funerary monuments that rivaled that of the pharaoh. His vizier, Mereruka, built a mastaba tomb at Saqqara which consisted of 33 richly carved rooms, the biggest known tomb for an Egyptian nobleman. This is considered to be a sign that Egypt&#x27;s wealth was being transferred from the central court to the officials, a slow process that culminated in the end to the Old Kingdom.

The Egyptian priest and chronicler Manetho states that Teti was murdered by his palace bodyguards in a harem plot, and he appears to have been briefly succeeded by a short-lived usurper, Userkare. Teti was buried in the royal necropolis at Saqqara. His pyramid complex is associated with the mastabas of officials from his reign. Teti&#x27;s highest date is his Year after the 6th Count 3rd Month of Summer day lost (Year 12 if the count was biannual) from Hatnub Graffito No.1. This information is confirmed by the South Saqqara Stone Annal document from Pepi II&#x27;s reign which gives him a reign of around 12 years.

==Third &quot;subsidiary&quot; pyramid to Teti&#x27;s tomb==
Teti&#x27;s mother was the Queen Sesheshet, who was instrumental in her son&#x27;s accession to the throne and a reconciling of two warring factions of the royal family. Sesheshet lived between 2323 BC to 2291 BC. Egypt&#x27;s chief archaeologist Zahi Hawass, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, announced on 11 November 2008 that she was entombed in a 4,300-year-old tall pyramid at Saqqara. This is the 118th pyramid discovered thus far in Egypt; the largest portion of its 2-metre-wide casing was built with a superstructure 5 metres high. It originally reached 14 metres, with sides 22 metres long.

Once 5 stories tall, it lay beneath of sand, a small shrine and mud-brick walls from later periods. The third known &quot;subsidiary&quot; pyramid to Teti&#x27;s tomb was originally tall and square at its base, due to its walls having stood at a 51-degree angle. Buried next to the Saqqara Step Pyramid, its base lies 65 feet underground and is believed to have been 50 feet tall when it was built.


== Funerary temple of Queen Neith ==

In January 2021, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced the discovery of more than 50 wooden sarcophagi in 52 burial shafts dating back to the New Kingdom period, as well as a 13 ft-long papyrus containing texts from the Book of the Dead.

Archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass at Saqqara also found the funerary temple of queen Neith and warehouses made of bricks. Previously unknown to researchers, she was a wife of Teti.

<text>A muffin or bun is an individually portioned baked product; however, the term can refer to one of two distinct items: a part-raised flatbread (like a crumpet) that is baked and then cooked on a griddle (typically unsweetened), or a (often sweetened) quickbread that is chemically leavened and then baked in a mold. While quickbread &quot;American&quot; muffins are often sweetened, there are savory varieties made with ingredients such as corn and cheese, and less sweet varieties like traditional &quot;bran muffins&quot;. The flatbread &quot;English&quot; variety is of British or other European derivation, and dates from at least the early 18th century, while the quickbread originated in North America during the 19th century. Both types are common worldwide today.

== Etymology ==
One 19th century source suggests that &quot;muffin&quot; may be related to the Greek bread , a &#x27;cake baked on a hearth or griddle&#x27;, or from Old French &#x27;soft bread&#x27;, which may have been altered into . The word is first found in print in 1703, spelled &quot;&quot;; it is of uncertain origin but possibly derived from the Low German , the plural of , meaning &#x27;small cake&#x27;, or possibly with some connection to the Old French meaning &#x27;soft&#x27;, as said of bread. The expression &quot;muffin-man&quot;, meaning a street seller of muffins, is attested in a 1754 poem, which includes the line: &quot;Hark! the shrill Muffin-Man his Carol plies.&quot;

==Quickbread muffins==

Quickbread muffins (sometimes described in Britain as &quot;American muffins&quot;) are baked, individual-sized, cupcake-shaped foods with a &quot;moist, coarse-grained&quot; texture. Muffins are available in both savoury varieties, such as cornmeal and cheese muffins, or sweet varieties such as blueberry, chocolate chip, lemon or banana flavours. Sweetened muffins range from lightly sweetened muffins to products that are &quot;richer than many cakes in fat and sugar.&quot; They are similar to cupcakes in size and cooking methods, the main difference being that cupcakes tend to be sweet desserts using cake batter and which are often topped with sugar icing (American frosting). Muffins may have solid items mixed into the batter, such as berries, chocolate chips or nuts. Fresh baked muffins are sold by bakeries, donut shops and some fast food restaurants and coffeehouses. Factory baked muffins are sold at grocery stores and convenience stores and are also served in some coffeeshops and cafeterias.

===History=== 
Recipes for quickbread muffins are common in 19th-century American cookbooks. Recipes for yeast-based muffins, which were sometimes called &quot;common muffins&quot; or &quot;wheat muffins&quot; in 19th-century American cookbooks, can be found in much older cookbooks. In Fannie Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot;, she gave recipes for both types of muffins, both those that used yeast to raise the dough and those that used a quick bread method, using muffin rings to shape the English muffins. Farmer indicated that stove top &quot;baking&quot;, as is done with yeast dough, was a useful method when baking in an oven was not practical. Over the years, the size and calorie content of muffins has changed: the &lt;q&gt;3-inch muffins grandmother made had only 120 to 160 calories. But today&#x27;s giant bakery muffins contain from 340 to 630 calories each.&lt;/q&gt;

===Manufacture===
Quickbread muffins are made with flour, sieved together with bicarbonate of soda as a raising agent. To this is added butter or shortening, eggs and any flavourings (fruit, such as blueberries, chocolate or banana; or savouries, such as cheese).

Commercial muffins may have &quot;modified starches&quot;, corn syrup (or high-fructose corn syrup), xanthan gum, or guar gum to increase moisture content and lengthen shelf life (as well, these gums can make added solids, such as chocolate chips, disperse more evenly in the batter).

=== Bran muffins ===

Bran muffins use less flour and use bran instead, as well as using molasses and brown sugar. The mix is turned into a pocketed muffin tray, or into individual paper moulds, and baked in an oven. Milk is often added, as it contributes to the appealing browning appearance. The result are raised, individual quickbreads. The muffin may have toppings added, such as cinnamon sugar, streusel, nuts, or chocolate chips.

===Poppyseed muffins===

Poppyseed muffins (or poppy seed muffins) contain poppy seeds. Poppy seeds were already popular in most parts of the world for their taste and texture—as well as the narcotic characteristics of the opium poppy plant they are harvested from. In modern times, growing poppy seeds is a difficult business for American farmers, due to the risk of heroin production. Other countries have fewer difficulties with permitting the growth of poppies for the seeds alone, which have very low (but still present) levels of opium alkaloids, such as morphine. As other countries began imitating the American muffin, the occasional use of poppy seeds to flavor them spread as well. Although poppy seeds cannot be used as a narcotic due to very low levels of opium alkaloids, they do have enough that drug tests are often fooled and give out false positives after an otherwise drug-free person consumes just a few poppyseed muffins. Because of this, all poppyseed pastries place the person who consumes them prior to a test at a high risk of being inaccurately considered a drug user.

Lemon is a common paired flavour with poppyseeds in muffin-making.

===Nutrition===
Harvard University&#x27;s Nutrition Source states that while many fruit muffins may seem &quot;...to be a better breakfast than their donut neighbors&quot; at your local coffeeshop, with their &quot;...often refined flours, high sodium, and plenty of added sugar...and large portion size, they&#x27;re far from the optimal food choice to start your day.&quot; Consumers think that commercial muffins are a healthier choice than donuts; however, according to Registered Dietician Karen Collins, yeast or raised donuts have from 170 to 270 calories each (cake doughnuts have from 290 to 360 calories), while large bakery muffins have from 340 to 630 calories each and 11 to 27 grams of total fat. &quot;Most muffins are deceptively high in fats&quot;, with up to 40% fat content, which many consumers are not aware of.

The type of muffin can have a big impact on its fat and sugar content; one major fast food chain&#x27;s low-fat berry muffin has 300 calories, whereas the same restaurant&#x27;s chocolate chunk muffin has 620 calories. Harvard&#x27;s Nutrition Source recommends smaller-sized, whole-grain muffins with reduced sugar content, liquid plant oil instead of shortening or butter, and added wholesome foods such as nuts (or nut flour), beans (or bean flour), or fresh fruit or vegetables.

=== Muffin tops ===

The muffin top is the crisp upper part of the muffin, which has developed a &quot;browned crust that&#x27;s slightly singed around the edges&quot;. They were the focus of a 1997 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; sitcom episode, &quot;The Muffin Tops&quot; (episode 21 of season 8), where the character Elaine, who only eats the tops when she buys a muffin, realizes that a bakery selling just the tops could be successful. Once the business is running, she has to figure out what to do with the muffin bottoms, which proves difficult.

In 2018, McDonald&#x27;s restaurant announced they were planning to sell muffin tops as part of their McCafe breakfast menu.

===Bakeware and baking aids===

Muffin tins and muffin pans are typically metal bakeware which has round bowl-shaped depressions into which muffin batter is poured. Muffin tins or pans can be greased with butter or cooking spray, to lessen the issue of batter sticking to the pan. Alternatively, muffin cups or cases are used. Cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They are used in the baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin. The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.

A variety of sizes for muffin cases are available. Slightly different sizes are considered &quot;standard&quot; in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly in diameter at the base and tall. Standard-size cases range from in diameter at the base and are tall. Some jumbo-size cases can hold more than twice the size of standard cases. Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.

==Flatbread muffins==

Flatbread muffins (known in the United States and elsewhere as &quot;English muffins&quot;; or simply as &quot;muffins&quot; or &quot;bakery muffins&quot;) are a flatter disk-shaped, typically unsweetened yeast-leavened bread; generally about in diameter and tall. It is of English or European origin. Rather than being entirely oven-baked, they are also cooked in a griddle on the stove top and flipped from side-to-side, which results in a flattened shape rather than the rounded top seen in baked rolls or cake-type muffins. &quot;Cornmeal and bran are sometimes substituted for some of the flour.&quot; These muffins are popular in Commonwealth countries and the United States. Flatbread muffins are often served toasted for breakfast. They may be served with butter or margarine, and topped with sweet toppings, such as jam or honey, or savoury toppings (e.g., round sausage, cooked egg, cheese or bacon). Flatbread muffins are often eaten as a breakfast food (e.g. as an essential ingredient in Eggs Benedict and most of its variations), accompanied by coffee or tea.

===History===

Recipes for English muffins appear in published cookery books from the early 18th century, although the product is undoubtedly older than that. In the &quot;Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, Alan Davidson states that &quot;[t]here has always been some confusion between muffins, crumpets, and pikelets, both in recipes and in name.&quot; The increasing popularity of flatbread muffins in the 19th century, is attested by the existence of &quot;...muffin men [who] traversed the town streets at teatime, ringing their bells&quot; to sell them. The bell-ringing of muffin men became so common that by the 1840s, the British Parliament passed a law to prohibit bell ringing by muffin men, but it was not adhered to by sellers.

&quot;Mush muffins (called slipperdowns in New England) were a Colonial [American] muffin made with hominy on a hanging griddle.&quot; These and other types of flatbread muffins were known to American settlers, but they declined in popularity with the advent of the quickbread muffin. The flat muffin was re-introduced to the American market in 1880 as &quot;English muffin&quot; by English-American baker Samuel Beth Thomas (whose baked-goods company Thomas survives to this day). Thomas called the product &quot;toaster crumpets&quot;, and intended them as a &quot;more elegant alternative to toast&#x27; to be served in fine hotels. The English muffin has been described as a variant form of a crumpet, or a &quot;cousin&quot;, with the difference being the location of the holes; in a crumpet, the holes go all the way to the top, whereas with an English muffin, the holes are inside. In 1910, Fred Wolferman of Kansas City, Missouri began making denser English muffins at his family grocery, using empty tin cans as molds.

===Bakeware===
Muffin rings are metal cookware used for oven-baking or griddle-cooking flatbread muffins. They are circle-shaped objects made of thin metal. The rings are about one inch high.

A &quot;Muffineer&quot; was originally a sugar shaker, looking like a large salt cellar with a perforated decorative top, for spreading powdered sugar on muffins and other sweet cakes. Later, in the 19th century, the term was also used to describe a silver, or silver-plated, &quot;muffin dish&quot;, with a domed lid and a compartment below for hot water, used to keep toasted English muffins warm before serving.

===In popular culture===
&quot;The Muffin Man&quot; is a traditional nursery rhyme, children&#x27;s song or children&#x27;s game of English origin from 1820.

A well-known reference to English muffins is in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s 1895 play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

==As symbols==
American muffins appear as state symbols in three US states:
*The corn muffin is the official state muffin of Massachusetts.
* The blueberry muffin is the official state muffin of Minnesota.

<text>is a Japanese word processor produced by JustSystems, a Japanese software company. Ichitaro occupies the second share in Japanese word-processing software, behind Microsoft Word. It is one of the main products of the company. Its proprietary file extension is &quot;.JTD&quot;. ATOK, an IME developed by JustSystems, is bundled with Ichitaro.

In the DOS era, Ichitaro had a considerable market share along with other rivals. However, as Windows became dominant, the market was largely taken over by Microsoft Word.

== Origin of name ==
&quot;&quot; was named by , a founder of JustSystems. When he worked part-time as a tutor, one of his learners&#x27; names was Taro. He died of sickness when Kazunori worked at the company. Taro is also a common Japanese given name used for the eldest son. Sanyo Electric already had a trademark right of the name, so JustSystems added a prefix &quot;&quot; as they hoped the software won the best.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
JustSystems was founded in July 1979 by and Kazunori Ukigawa, and was incorporated in June 1981. Kazunori worked at a subsidiary company of Toshiba, and he was interested in Japanese-language computing. Toshiba released in February 1979, the first word processor for the Japanese language, but it sold less than their business computers. He founded the company as a dealer of business computers, and they started selling Japanese language software. After the release of PC-8801, they developed an invoicing software for it, which printed out estimations and invoices in Japanese. They demonstrated it at trade fairs, and received a positive response.

When they contacted to ASCII Microsoft about a run-time license fee of the BASIC compiler used for their farm management software, ASCII had known JustSystem&#x27;s Japanese software, so they asked JustSystems to develop a Japanese word processor software for PC-100. It was released as JS-WORD in 1983. It was followed by JS-WORD 2.0 ported for PC-9801. Both were published by ASCII under their name. JS-WORD featured mouse support and a graphical icon-based interface, but it resulted in poor performance. The jX-WORD for the IBM JX was released and in 1985, jX-WORD Taro was released for PC-9801. jX-WORD Taro was priced at ¥58,000, which was the middle price among Japanese word processor software, and sold 9,700 copies.

=== Domination in Japan PC market ===
The same year, Ichitaro was released as its definite successor. Ichitaro&#x27;s system disk contained ATOK 4 and a runtime version of MS-DOS 2.11. It allowed users to use other MS-DOS applications with Japanese language support. The biggest competitor, , was released in 1983 by . It gained speed from being written in assembly language and natively ran on PC-9801, but Matsu&#x27;s Japanese input method couldn&#x27;t be used for other applications. Ichitaro had plenty of typesettings options, but Matsu did not. Also, Matsu was priced at ¥128,000 before Ichitaro came out.

The first version of Ichitaro has shipped 29,000 copies. Ichitaro Ver.2 has shipped 80,000 copies. Ichitaro Ver.3 was the first version ported for other Japanese DOS platforms. It has shipped more than 300,000 copies until 1991. Total shipments of Ichitaro reached one million in November 1991. Contrary to the Japanese personal computer market expanding into beginners, Matsu oriented for power users, so Ichitaro overtook it.

Ichitaro Ver.4 was released in April 1989. It had a proprietary operating environment called , like Lotus Symphony. Three minor versions were released because it was buggy. The stable version was 4.3 released in December 1989. ATOK 7 was bundled with Ichitaro 4, and was available as a standalone product in 1992.

=== Arrival of Microsoft Word ===
Microsoft released the first Japanese version of Microsoft Word for Windows in 1991. Four years passed before Ichitaro 5 was released for Japanese DOS platforms in April 1993. The next month, Microsoft released the Japanese Windows 3.1 and the first Japanese version of Microsoft Office, which included Word 5.0 and Excel 4.0. Its successors shipped 200,000 copies per month in late 1994. JustSystems barely completed a Windows adaptation of Ichitaro in December 1993, but Microsoft took over the market dominated by Ichitaro and Lotus 1-2-3.

As of 1997, a Japanese media website reported that 64% of readers using Microsoft Word, and the main reason was that they used it in offices and schools. The rest of 35% were using Ichitaro, and the main reason was that the IME of ATOK was convenient.

In 1998, the Japan Fair Trade Commission informed Microsoft of an unfair trade that they forced personal computer manufacturers to bundle with Excel and Word against the request of a bundle with Excel and Ichitaro.

Ichitaro Ver.5 was ported to the Macintosh and to OS/2. In May 2003, the release of a Linux version was announced. Compact versions, &quot;Ichitaro dash&quot; and &quot;Ichitaro lite&quot; are produced for laptop PCs. As office suite, &quot;Just home&quot; is also available. &quot;Ichitaro smile&quot; is targeted at elementary school students and &quot;Ichitaro jump&quot; at middle and high school students.

On 1 February 2005, sales and production of the software were frozen pending an appeal by the company against a ruling of the Tokyo District Court which states that there is a breach of a patent owned by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. However, on 30 September 2005, Intellectual Property High Court of Japan, which was newly formed in April 2005, has granted JustSystems’ appeal. Because this judgement became a final decision in October 2005, the original decision sentenced by the Tokyo District Court was overturned.

In 2009, JustSystems became a subsidiary company of Keyence. In the 2010s, they focus on correspondence education and enterprise software although Ichitaro and ATOK continue to be developed.

==Versions==

==Security==
In 2013, Symantec revealed that Ichitaro had the potential to be targeted by trojan horse programs. A gang of Chinese hackers was widely blamed for the incident.

<doc id="312510" wikidata="Q827360" url="?curid=312510" title="USS Nautilus (SSN-571)">
<text>USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571) was the world&#x27;s first operational nuclear-powered submarine and on 3 August 1958 became the first submarine to complete a submerged transit of the North Pole. Her initial commanding officer was Eugene &quot;Dennis&quot; Wilkinson, a widely respected naval officer who set the stage for many of the protocols of today&#x27;s Nuclear Navy of the US, and who had a storied career during military service and afterwards.

Sharing a name with Captain Nemo&#x27;s fictional submarine in Jules Verne&#x27;s classic 1870 science fiction novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; and the that served with distinction in World War II, the new nuclear-powered &quot;Nautilus&quot; was authorized in 1951. Construction began in 1952, and the boat was launched in January 1954, sponsored by Mamie Eisenhower, First Lady of the United States, wife of 34th President Dwight D. Eisenhower; it was commissioned the following September into the United States Navy. &quot;Nautilus&quot; was delivered to the Navy in 1955.

Because her nuclear propulsion allowed her to remain submerged far longer than diesel-electric submarines, she broke many records in her first years of operation and traveled to locations previously beyond the limits of submarines. In operation, she revealed a number of limitations in her design and construction. This information was used to improve subsequent submarines.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; was decommissioned in 1980 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. The submarine has been preserved as a museum ship at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, where the vessel receives around 250,000 visitors per year.

==Planning and construction==

The conceptual design of the first nuclear submarine began in March 1950 as project SCB 64. In July 1951, the United States Congress authorized the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine for the U.S. Navy, which was planned and personally supervised by Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover, USN, known as the &quot;Father of the Nuclear Navy.&quot; On 12 December 1951, the US Department of the Navy announced that the submarine would be called &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the fourth U.S. Navy vessel officially so named. The boat carried the hull number SSN-571. 

Designers drew inspiration from the advanced hydrodynamic hull design of the German Type XXI U-boat developed during World War II.

The Type XXI U-boat featured a streamlined shape, which allowed for greater underwater speed and efficiency compared to earlier submarine designs that were primarily optimized for surface travel. Its revolutionary approach to underwater performance influenced post-war submarine development worldwide, including the U.S. Navy’s decision to focus on fully submerged operations. 

Nautilus benefited from the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) improvements to the American -, -, and -class submarines.

&quot;Nautilus&quot;″s keel was laid at General Dynamics&#x27; Electric Boat Division in Groton, Connecticut, by Harry S. Truman on 14 June 1952. She was christened on 21 January 1954 and launched into the Thames River, sponsored by Mamie Eisenhower. &quot;Nautilus&quot; was commissioned on 30 September 1954, under the command of Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, USN.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; was powered by the Submarine Thermal Reactor (STR), later redesignated the S2W reactor, a pressurized water reactor produced for the US Navy by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, operated by Westinghouse, developed the basic reactor plant design used in &quot;Nautilus&quot; after being given the assignment on 31 December 1947 to design a nuclear power plant for a submarine. Nuclear power had a crucial advantage in submarine propulsion because it is a zero-emission process that consumes no air. This design is the basis for nearly all of the US nuclear-powered submarine and surface combat ships, and was adapted by other countries for naval nuclear propulsion. The first actual prototype (for &quot;Nautilus&quot;) was constructed and tested by the Argonne National Laboratory in 1953 at S1W at the Naval Reactors Facility, part of the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; ship&#x27;s patch was designed by The Walt Disney Company, and her wardroom currently displays a set of tableware made of zirconium, as the nuclear fuel cladding was partly made of zirconium.

==&quot;Underway on nuclear power&quot;==
Following her commissioning, &quot;Nautilus&quot; remained dockside for further construction and testing. On the morning of 17 January 1955, at 11 am EST, &quot;Nautilus&quot;″ first Commanding Officer, Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, ordered all lines cast off and signaled the memorable and historic message, &quot;Underway on nuclear power.&quot; On 10 May, she headed south for shakedown. Submerged throughout, she traveled from New London to San Juan, Puerto Rico and covered in less than ninety hours. At the time, this was the longest submerged cruise by a submarine and at the highest sustained speed (for at least one hour) ever recorded.
From 1955 to 1957, &quot;Nautilus&quot; continued to be used to investigate the effects of increased submerged speeds and endurance. These improvements rendered the progress made in anti-submarine warfare during World War II virtually obsolete. Radar and anti-submarine aircraft, which had proved crucial in defeating submarines during the war, proved ineffective against a vessel able to move quickly out of an area, change depth quickly and stay submerged for very long periods.

On 4 February 1957, &quot;Nautilus&quot; logged her 60,000th nautical mile (), matching the endurance of her namesake, the fictional &quot;Nautilus&quot; described in Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea&quot;. In May, she departed for the Pacific Coast to participate in coastal exercises and the fleet exercise, operation &quot;Home Run,&quot; which acquainted units of the Pacific Fleet with the capabilities of nuclear submarines.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; returned to New London, Connecticut, on 21 July and departed again on 19 August for her first voyage of under the polar pack ice. Thereafter, she headed for the Eastern Atlantic to participate in NATO exercises and conduct a tour of various British and French ports where she was inspected by defense personnel of those countries. She arrived back at New London on 28 October, underwent upkeep, and then conducted coastal operations until the spring.

===Operation Sunshine – under the North Pole===

In response to the Soviet Union&#x27;s successful launch of Sputnik, President Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Navy to attempt a submarine transit of the North Pole as a technological showpiece. On 25 April 1958, &quot;Nautilus&quot; was underway again for the West Coast, now commanded by Commander William R. Anderson, USN. Stopping at San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle, she began her history-making polar transit, &quot;Operation Sunshine&quot;, as she departed the latter port on 9 June. On 19 June, she entered the Chukchi Sea, but was turned back by deep drift ice in those shallow waters. On 28 June, she arrived at Pearl Harbor to await better ice conditions.

By 23 July, her wait was over, and she set a course northward. She submerged in the Barrow Sea Valley on 1 August and on 3 August, at 2315 hrs. EDT she became the first watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole. The ability to navigate at extreme latitudes without surfacing was enabled by the technology of the North American Aviation N6A-1 Inertial Navigation System, a naval modification of the N6A used in the Navaho cruise missile; it had been installed on &quot;Nautilus&quot; and after initial sea trials on in 1957. From the North Pole, she continued and after 96 hours and under the ice, surfaced northeast of Greenland, having completed the first successful submerged voyage around the North Pole. The technical details of this mission were planned by scientists from the Naval Electronics Laboratory including Dr. Waldo Lyon who accompanied &quot;Nautilus&quot; as chief scientist and ice pilot.

Navigation beneath the arctic ice sheet was difficult. Above 85°N both magnetic compasses and normal gyrocompasses become inaccurate. A special gyrocompass built by Sperry Rand was installed shortly before the journey. There was a risk that the submarine would become disoriented beneath the ice and that the crew would have to play &quot;longitude roulette&quot;. Commander Anderson had considered using torpedoes to blow a hole in the ice if the submarine needed to surface.

The most difficult part of the journey was in the Bering Strait. The ice extended as much as below sea level. During the initial attempt to go through the Bering Strait, there was insufficient room between the ice and the sea bottom. During the second, successful attempt to pass through the Bering passage, the submarine passed through a known channel close to Alaska (this was not the first choice, as the submarine wanted to avoid detection).

The trip beneath the ice cap was an important boost for America as the Soviets had recently launched Sputnik, but had no nuclear submarine of their own. During the address announcing the journey, the president mentioned that one day nuclear cargo submarines might use that route for trade.

As &quot;Nautilus&quot; proceeded south from Greenland, a helicopter airlifted Commander Anderson to connect with transport to Washington, D.C. At a White House ceremony on 8 August, President Eisenhower presented him with the Legion of Merit and announced that the crew had earned a Presidential Unit Citation.

At her next port of call, the Isle of Portland, England, she received the Unit Citation, the first ever issued in peace time, from American Ambassador JH Whitney, and then crossed the Atlantic reaching New London, Connecticut, on 29 October. For the remainder of the year, &quot;Nautilus&quot; operated from her home port of New London.

===Operational history===

Following fleet exercises in early 1959, &quot;Nautilus&quot; entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for her first complete overhaul (28 May 1959 – 15 August 1960). Overhaul was followed by refresher training and on 24 October she departed New London for her first deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, returning to her home-port on 16 December.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; spent most of her career assigned to Submarine Squadron 10 (SUBRON 10) at State Pier in New London, Connecticut. &quot;Nautilus&quot; and other submarines in the squadron made their home tied up alongside the tender, where they received preventive maintenance, and if necessary, repairs, from the well-equipped submarine tender USS &quot;Fulton&quot; (AS-11) and her crew of machinists, millwrights, and other craftsmen.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; operated in the Atlantic, conducting evaluation tests for ASW improvements and participating in NATO exercises. During October 1962, &quot;Nautilus&quot; participated in the naval blockade of Cuba until she headed east again for a two-month Mediterranean tour in August 1963. On her return she joined in fleet exercises until entering the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for her second overhaul on 17 January 1964.

On 2 May 1966, &quot;Nautilus &quot;returned to her homeport to resume operations with the Atlantic Fleet, and at some point during that month, logged her 300,000th nautical mile () underway. For the next year and a quarter she conducted special operations for ComSubLant and then in August 1967, returned to Portsmouth, for another year&#x27;s stay. During an exercise in 1966 she collided with the aircraft carrier on 10 November, while at shallow depth. Following repairs in Portsmouth she conducted exercises off the southeastern seaboard. She returned to New London in December 1968 and operated as a unit of Submarine Squadron 10 for most of the remainder of her career.
On 9 April 1979, &quot;Nautilus&quot; set out from Groton, Connecticut on her final voyage under the command of Richard A. Riddell. She reached Mare Island Naval Shipyard of Vallejo, California on 26 May 1979, her last day underway. She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 March 1980.

===Noise===
Toward the end of her service, the hull and sail of &quot;Nautilus&quot; vibrated sufficiently that sonar became ineffective at more than speed. As noise generation is extremely undesirable in submarines, this made the vessel vulnerable to sonar detection. Lessons learned from this problem were applied to later nuclear submarines.

==Awards and commendations==
===Presidential Unit Citation===
To commemorate the first submerged voyage under the North Pole, all &quot;Nautilus&quot; crewmembers who made the voyage may wear a Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a gold block letter N (image above).

==Museum==
&quot;Nautilus&quot; was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Secretary of the Interior on 20 May 1982.

She was named as the official state ship of Connecticut in 1983. Following an extensive conversion at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Nautilus&quot; was towed back to Groton, under the command of Captain John Almon, arriving on 6 July 1985. On 11 April 1986, &quot;Nautilus&quot; opened to the public as part of the Submarine Force Library and Museum.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; now serves as a museum of submarine history operated by the Naval History and Heritage Command. The ship underwent a five-month preservation in 2002 at Electric Boat, at a cost of approximately $4.7 million (~$ in ). &quot;Nautilus&quot; attracts some 250,000 visitors annually to her present berth near Naval Submarine Base New London.

&quot;Nautilus&quot; celebrated the 50th anniversary of her commissioning on 30 September 2004 with a ceremony that included a speech from Vice Admiral Eugene P. Wilkinson, her first Commanding Officer, and a designation of the ship as an American Nuclear Society National Nuclear Landmark.

Visitors may tour the forward two compartments, with guidance from an automated system. Despite similar alterations to exhibit the engineering spaces, tours aft of the control room are not permitted due to safety and security concerns.

In March 2022, &quot;Nautilus&quot; began a restoration process that was expected to last 6 to 8 months. Included in the work: blasting and painting of the hull, installation of new top decks, as well as upgraded interior lighting and electrical. The restoration was completed at a cost of US$36 million.
