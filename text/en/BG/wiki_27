<text>Covenant is a Swedish electronic band formed in Helsingborg in 1986. The band is currently composed of Eskil Simonsson and Joakim Montelius in the studio, while live shows consist of Simonsson along with touring members Chad Hauger, Daniel Jonasson, Andreas Catjar and Daniel Myer of Haujobb.

Their music comprises a mixture of synthpop and electronic body music. They have been releasing music since the early 1990s.

== History ==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, electronic music and several of its subgenres became a preferred musical style among European underground culture. It gained favor initially within major cities and eventually trickled into the continent&#x27;s more secluded regions. This new wave of music was discovered at different instances by a group of friends living in Helsingborg, a scenic town in south western Sweden. Eskil Simonsson, Joakim Montelius and Clas Nachmanson, three teenagers with mutual, youthful curiosities for science, philosophy, and matters of existence, were all enthralled by the unique presentation and the emotional content of the music, specifically by that of bands such as Kraftwerk, The Human League, Depeche Mode, Front 242 and Nitzer Ebb. It was after attending the first Front 242 show in Scandinavia that the trio and others familiar to them decided to start a band.

The friends carried this fascination with them to university life in the historic town of Lund, approximately southeast of Helsingborg. In between their academic endeavors and discussions of worldly affairs, they assembled a small recording studio in Nachmanson&#x27;s bedroom and began to experiment with their own musical compositions. In 1988, the name &quot;Covenant&quot; was selected for the group—a name derived from the unspoken spiritual bond the trio professed to share.

As Covenant, the three produced their first publicly released track, &quot;The Replicant&quot;, by invitation of Swedish record label Memento Materia. &quot;The Replicant&quot; was released on a compilation album in 1992, and the track thrilled label executives, prompting them to ask for a full album. In 1994, the group compiled enough songs to release the album, which became &quot;Dreams of a Cryotank&quot;. It was well received by critics and fans alike, and with its success, the boyhood friends decided to take their musical efforts more seriously. They upgraded and added more equipment, relocated their studio, and committed to tour.

In 1995, Covenant performed at a festival in Germany at the request of Off-Beat Records. The band impressed Off-Beat&#x27;s attending A&amp;R representative, who signed them to a record deal the following day. Excited by the prospect of broader exposure, the band members eased further away from their educational pursuits and devoted themselves to completing a new album, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Sequencer&quot;. Later in 1996, the band released the &quot;Stalker&quot; single before embarking on a tour with Haujobb and Steril across Germany, Belgium, and Holland.

With &quot;Sequencer&quot;, the band sought to improve upon the weaknesses they found in &quot;Dreams&quot; by combining sequencing, diverse melodies, and commanding lyrics. It became an instant classic among many observers, some of whom boldly declared it &quot;the best electro album of the decade.&quot; It would go on to be re-released a number of times throughout the world and remains a club favorite in many settings.

Later in the year, San-Francisco-based record label 21st Circuitry agreed to distribute Covenant&#x27;s albums in the United States, expanding the band&#x27;s reach in the process. As a result, the group created the &quot;Theremin&quot; EP in 1997 specifically for North American release and started to accept tour dates throughout the US and Canada.

The trio&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Europa&quot;, debuted in 1998. &quot;Europa&quot; carried Covenant&#x27;s initially aggressive, often distorted brand of music into the beat-driven realm of synth pop, marking the beginning of a gradual evolution in the band&#x27;s collective sound. In the US, the album peaked at #101 on the CMJ Radio Top 200 and reached #3 on the CMJ RPM charts. Also in 1998, they sued the Norwegian black metal/Industrial metal band The Kovenant (then known as &quot;Covenant&quot;) for the rights to the name &quot;Covenant&quot;, arguing that they had established use of the name first and forcing the Norwegian band to change the spelling of their name.

Covenant spent 1999 touring, changing record labels, and on the preparation of another album. Off-Beat Records went out of business, and Dependent was created by former Off-Beat employees. Together with a few selected former Off-Beat acts, Covenant joined Dependent. In addition, Covenant were signed with SubSpace Communications in Sweden, effectively ending their tenure with Memento Materia. Meanwhile, 21st Circuitry Records ceased operations, leading the three to find a new home in America with Metropolis Records (Metropolis had bought the rights to the 21st Circuitry back catalogue). Shortly thereafter, the band&#x27;s first three albums and the &quot;Theremin&quot; EP were re-issued in the US under the Metropolis label.

&quot;United States of Mind&quot; was released in 2000, and with it, Covenant&#x27;s tendencies strayed further into synth pop. Also released that year was a stand-alone single, &quot;Der Leiermann&quot; It was a version of the German Art song of the same name, but sung to the tune of the album track &#x27;&quot;Like Tears in Rain&quot;. &quot;Der Leiermann&quot; was originally a poem by Wilhelm Müller, set to music by Franz Schubert as part of the poem cycle &quot;Die Winterreise&quot;. S. Alexander Reed asserts that this point in Covenant&#x27;s career marks a distinct break from previous work in an attempt to project a sense of the &quot;sublime built on wonder, rather than abjection.&quot;

A live album, &quot;Synergy&quot;, was released later in the year which featured tracks from the band&#x27;s first four albums. The group continued with 2002&#x27;s &quot;Northern Light&quot;, which they portrayed as having a more sombre, cold sound in comparison to their earlier offerings. In another transition between labels, the European release of &quot;Northern Light&quot; was handled by Sony Music&#x27;s Ka2 division rather than Dependent or Subspace. The US release was through Metropolis.

Whilst they continued to produce music together, Montelius and Simonsson took up residence in separate countries; Montelius residing in Barcelona, Spain, and Simonsson living in Berlin, Germany. Nachmanson remained in Helsingborg.

Covenant released their sixth studio album, &quot;Skyshaper&quot;, in March 2006 to an overall positive reception. The band toured Europe prior to the album&#x27;s release and toured the United States beginning in September 2006.

In March 2007, Covenant announced that Nachmanson would not be touring with the band and his replacement would be Daniel Myer of Haujobb. In an interview with &quot;Side-Line&quot; magazine, Covenant&#x27;s Joakim Montelius said he was not sure if Clas would still continue with Covenant.

In October 2007, Covenant released the road movie &quot;In Transit&quot; on DVD. It contained material from the world tour undertaken in support of the album &quot;Skyshaper&quot; and documented the band&#x27;s travels in Europe, North America, South America and across Russia over a period of 18 months. The band confirmed Clas&#x27; departure in the DVD documentary.

In January 2011, Covenant released their seventh studio album, &quot;Modern Ruin&quot; — the first album by the band with Myer as a core member. The band released a new EP, &quot;Last Dance&quot; in June 2013. The band released their new album, &quot;Leaving Babylon&quot;, in September 2013.

In April 2015, the band embarked on a North American tour to promote &quot;Leaving Babylon&quot;. The band, joined on tour by opening band The Labrynth, performed in approximately 20 cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas. &quot;Slug Magazine&quot; favorably reviewed the 6 April show in Salt Lake City, describing Covenant&#x27;s stage presence as &quot;exquisite&quot; and &quot;just as powerful as their music.&quot;

In October 2015, Covenant headlined the Gothic Meets Klassik festival in Leipzig, Germany, along with British synthpop band Mesh and songwriter and electronic musician Anne Clark.

In November 2016, they released their ninth studio album &quot;The Blinding Dark&quot;. It was accompanied by a tour in Europe and, in 2018, the UK. and the US.

In February 2019, the band commenced a ten-city tour through Germany, starting in Berlin on 7 February. Concert attendees were offered a new extended play record called &quot;Fieldworks: Exkursion EP&quot;. It featured five tracks, each written by a member of the band, and one song in collaboration with French electro-industrial newcomer Grabyourface, who also performed opening sets during the band&#x27;s German tour that year. According to the band&#x27;s Facebook page, this EP is intended to be the first of an upcoming cycle of records associated with the &quot;Fieldworks&quot; theme. The new music was inspired in part by sounds collected at an electricity plant, according to an interview conducted by a writer for the magazine &quot;Zero&quot;. &quot;This time we wanted to use the sounds we have collected for many years, from exotic places on the six continents we have visited as a band, as well as the mundane hum of everyday life, as stepping stones for the songs,&quot; Joakim Montelius explained in an interview published on Gruftbote.

The band headlined the final day of the Terminus Festival in Calgary on 28 July 2019 and then embarked on a set of five U.S. shows in Seattle (30 July), Portland (31 July), Los Angeles (2 August), Oakland (4 August), and Denver (6 August).

<text>The speckled day gecko (Phelsuma guttata) is a diurnal species of geckos. It lives in eastern Madagascar and typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. The speckled day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Description==
This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. It can reach a total length of about 13 cm. The body colour of this slender and long-snouted gecko is dark green. There are several small orange spots on the middle and lower portion of the back. A black eye stripe extends from the nostril to above the ear opening. Typical for this species are several v-shaped stripes on the throat. The flanks, legs and toes are white speckled. Some populations have some blue spots in the neck region. The ventral side is grayish white.

==Distribution==
This species inhabits north-east Madagascar, along the coast. It can also be found on some nearby islets.

==Habitat==
&quot;P. guttata&quot; typically lives in rainforests where they live on trees and avoid bright sun light. Since much of the primary rainforest has been cleared, this species is also found on bushes and introduced banana trees.
==Diet==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
This &quot;Phelsuma&quot; species is often found in pairs on a tree. Juveniles mainly inhabit surrounding low shrubs.

==Reproduction==
The females lay a pair of eggs and hide them on the ground under foliage or wood or they may lay their eggs on trees under loose bark. At a temperature of 28 °C, the young will hatch after approximately 40–45 days. The juveniles measure 45 mm.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
These animals should be housed in pairs in a well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between . The humidity should be maintained between 75. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruits flies, mealworms and houseflies.

<text>Happy Rhodes (born Kimberley Tyler Rhodes, August 9, 1965) is an American singer, musician, and songwriter with a four-octave vocal range, releasing 11 albums between 1986 and 2007. 

== Family ==

Rhodes&#x27; maternal grandfather Dave Stamper wrote songs for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1913 through 1931 and composed the music for several other Broadway shows. A family legend claims that Stamper wrote the well-known song &quot;Shine On, Harvest Moon&quot; in 1903 for Nora Bayes when he was working as her Vaudeville piano accompanist, but sold the rights and credit to Bayes and her husband Jack Norworth. Rhodes&#x27; parents divorced when she was young. Rhodes has two brothers who are twins.

== Musical background ==

Rhodes received her first musical instrument, an acoustic guitar, as a gift from her mother, at age 11. At 14 she was performing original songs in school shows. She left school early at age 16, choosing to obtain a GED. From age 16 to 18, Rhodes began performing in open mic nights at Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York. During this period, Rhodes met Pat Tessitore, the owner of a recording studio, Cathedral Sound Studios in Rensselaer, and became a studio intern to learn recording techniques. Tessitore was impressed with Rhodes&#x27; voice and songwriting and volunteered to record all of the songs she had written to that point.

Tessitore introduced Rhodes to Kevin Bartlett, a musician who had his record label, Aural Gratification, and he urged her to gather up all the songs that she had recorded, to be released on cassette. She had enough songs to release three cassettes at the same time in 1986, &quot;Rhodes Vol. I&quot;, &quot;Rhodes Vol. II&quot;, and &quot;Rearmament&quot;. In 1987, she released the cassette of &quot;Ecto&quot;. Her first CD release was &quot;Warpaint&quot;, in 1991. The first four albums were only available on hand-dubbed cassettes until they were re-released on CD in 1992. For the CD releases, &quot;Rhodes Vol. I&quot; was renamed &quot;Rhodes I&quot;, and &quot;Rhodes Vol. II&quot; was renamed &quot;Rhodes II&quot;. Each of the CD re-releases contained bonus tracks not on the original cassettes. Aural Gratification released nine Happy Rhodes albums between 1986 and 1995, including &quot;Equipoise&quot; and &quot;RhodeSongs&quot; in 1993, &quot;Building The Colossus&quot; in 1994, and &quot;The Keep&quot; in 1995. Rhodes left Aural Gratification in 1998.

Rhodes&#x27; 10th album, &quot;Many Worlds Are Born Tonight&quot;, was released in August 1998 by Samson Music, a label founded by Norm Waitt Jr., brother of Ted Waitt, co-founder of the Gateway Computer company. Rhodes was dropped from Samson when the label decided to concentrate on other genres of music and Samson transferred rights to the material back to Rhodes, as well as unsold products.

In 2001, Rhodes recorded an 11th album, called &quot;Find Me&quot;, which was released October 19, 2007.

Rhodes married musician Bob Muller in 2006 and they currently live on a farm in central upstate New York.

== Influences ==

Rhodes has cited Wendy Carlos, Kate Bush, Queen, Yes, David Bowie, Bach and Peter Gabriel as primary influences. Her father owned a large record collection which included Bagpipe music and Switched-On Bach, by Wendy Carlos. By age nine, Rhodes could sing along with every note from that album. As a teenager, she discovered the music of Queen and was impressed by their harmonies, which she later emulated on her first few albums. When Rhodes was introduced at age 16 to Kate Bush&#x27;s music by an English pen pal, she was impressed by Bush&#x27;s original writing style, vocal abilities, and independence as a female artist.

Rhodes has cited Bach&#x27;s Air on a G String as her favorite piece of music.

== Live performances ==
Most of her live shows have been in the northeast of America, primarily Philadelphia and New York City. Rhodes has sold out every show she&#x27;s performed in Philadelphia when she was the headliner. She has performed several times at the Tin Angel, where she always plays two shows in an evening. Rhodes has also played The Middle East Club in 1995, the Mann Theater (opening for 10,000 Maniacs) and the University Museum Auditorium, both in 1992. In New York City Rhodes has played the Bottom Line several times. In 1994 Rhodes performed at YesFest, a convention for fans of the band Yes. She has also performed at the Knitting Factory in New York City as a guest of the band Project Lo.

As a solo artist Rhodes has performed in Philadelphia, New York City, Cambridge, MA, Troy, NY, Albany, NY, Saratoga, NY, Woodstock, NY, Bearsville, NY, New Haven, CT, Danbury, CT, Maple Shade, NJ, Denville, NJ, Bryn Mawr, PA, Mechanicsburg, PA, Cleveland, OH, Toledo, OH, Kenosha, WI, Chicago, IL and Santa Cruz, CA.

Her last major solo tour was in support of her album &quot;Many Worlds are Born Tonight&quot; in 1998, playing at the El Flamingo Club in New York City, the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Troy, New York, the Painted Bride Arts Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Bearsville Theater in Bearsville, New York. Though the tour received positive reviews, It was not an economic success due to the ambitious multimedia presentation of the material.

=== Ectofest ===
In 1999 Meredith Tarr of New Haven and Chuck Stipak of Danbury, Connecticut organized a one-day music festival in Danbury to honor Rhodes and the mailing list Ecto, with all proceeds going to charity. The lineup for &quot;Ectofest 1999,&quot; held on September 4, 1999, consisted of Rhodes, Rachael Sage, Sloan Wainwright, Susan McKeown and the Mila Drumke Band. Tarr and Stipak repeated the festival the next year and on September 2, 2000 &quot;Ectofest 2000&quot; featured Rhodes, Jessica Weiser, Anne Heaton, Amy Fairchild, Sloan Wainwright, Merrie Amsterburg and Susan McKeown.

In 2001, West Coast fans (Shelly Deforte, Phil Hudson, and Bill Mazur), who were encouraged by other members of the Ecto music discussion group to host a West Coast version of the event, organized &quot;Ectofest West&quot; in Santa Cruz, California, held on June 9, 2001, at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. Rhodes flew to California to perform but on the day of the concert, she accidentally cut the ring finger on her fret hand while using a Leatherman tool, and severed the deep flexor tendon, as well as causing nerve damage. She was taken to the hospital where the hand was temporarily treated and bandaged. Rhodes performed 12 songs that evening sans guitar, relying on bandmates Eric Nicholas, Carl Adami, and Bob Muller to fill in her parts. Rhodes had surgery on the finger when she returned from California and underwent physical therapy so she could play the guitar again. Ectofest West is the only time Rhodes has performed in front of an audience west of Chicago. Other performers at the festival were Cyoakha Grace, Jill Tracy and Veda Hille. / Two Loons for Tea was scheduled to play but the band was stranded in Houston during a hurricane and was not able to get to Santa Cruz in time. Rhodes was scheduled to play Ectofest 2001 on August 25, 2001, in Danbury, CT but had to bow out because of her injury. Performers at that show were Edie Carey, Mila Drumke, Trina Hamlin, Jargon Society, Rachael Sage, and Molly Zenobia. 2001&#x27;s show was the last Ectofest until the 2007 Ectofest with Happy Rhodes, Noe Venable, and Casey Desmond on September 8, 2007, at / the Lily Pad in Cambridge, MA. The show sold out 3 weeks in advance, with fans traveling from all over the United States and also Scotland and Germany.

=== Security Project ===
In 2016, Rhodes came out of retirement and started singing with Security Project, a Peter Gabriel appreciation band featuring Jerry Marotta, Trey Gunn, Michael Cozzi, and David Jameson, singing lead for 11 live shows in 2016, 19 shows in 2017, and 8 more shows in Spring 2018.

== Fans ==
In 1991, Rhodes developed a following in Philadelphia through airplay on WXPN-FM. Her song &quot;Feed The Fire&quot; (from her album &quot;Warpaint&quot;) was said to be one of the station&#x27;s most requested songs of 1991. Rhodes has received airplay and has been interviewed on radio shows such as the syndicated programs Echoes, and The World Cafe. She has received airplay on Morning Becomes Eclectic from KCRW in Santa Monica, CA, and WDST in Woodstock, NY, where Rhodes lived for a time, appearing on the compilation &quot;Alternative Woodstock&quot;.

Much of the attention Rhodes has received has been via less traditional routes:

* In 1987 Aural Gratification released a sampler tape of Rhodes&#x27; music from the album &quot;Ecto&quot;. In the late summer of 1988 one of these cassettes was obtained by a programmer for an all-female-artists radio show called Suspended In Gaffa (named after a Kate Bush song) on KKFI-FM in Kansas City, MO. The programmer&#x27;s discussion of Rhodes&#x27; music during 1989–1991 on the Kate Bush Usenet newsgroup rec.music.gaffa led to the formation in 1991 of the &quot;Ecto&quot; mailing list, named after Rhodes&#x27; 4th album and the song by the same name on the album.
* In 2000, an unknown person mislabeled one of Rhodes&#x27; non-album tracks, &quot;When The Rain Came Down&quot; (a bonus track on the CD re-release of &quot;Ecto&quot;), as being a duet between Kate Bush and Annie Lennox (who have never worked together), and shared it on the original Napster file-sharing network.

=== Ecto (the mailing list) ===
* Ecto the Internet mailing list was created on June 13, 1991, by Jessica Koeppel Dembski out of Rutgers University. Originally called &quot;Ectoplasm,&quot; the mailing list name was changed within a few days. It has operated continuously since its inception, and has from the beginning encouraged discussion of other musicians besides Happy Rhodes, especially female artists. The mailing list changed hands in the mid-1990s to Greg Bossert, then shortly thereafter to Rob Woiccak, who continues to administer the list. Jeff Wasilko hosts the mailing list at his smoe domain, which hosts several other music mailing lists. Among fans, the term &quot;Ecto,&quot; used as a genre name, has grown to encompass several musicians who do not fit comfortably in other musical genres, such as Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel and Jane Siberry. Rhodes&#x27; fans have called themselves &quot;Ectophiles&quot; since almost the beginning of the mailing list, and the name was the inspiration for Tori Amos fans calling themselves &quot;Toriphiles.&quot; Ecto remains a busy discussion list, with members discussing Happy Rhodes and much other &quot;Ecto&quot;-philic music.
* Rhodes thanks the &quot;Ectophiles&quot; in the liner notes of the CD re-releases of &quot;Rhodes I&quot;, &quot;Rhodes II&quot;, &quot;Rearmament&quot;, &quot;Ecto&quot;, &quot;Many Worlds Are Born Tonight&quot; and &quot;Find Me&quot;.
* Rhodes and the mailing list Ecto were the inspiration for the creation of The Ectophiles&#x27; Guide to Good Music, a collection of music reviews by Ectophiles created in 1998 by poet and author Neile Graham.
* A fan magazine, Terra Incognita (aka Rhodeways), was published by Sharon Nichols from 1994 to 2000.

=== 1983 – 1987 ===

Her first four albums, &quot;Rhodes Volume I&quot; (1986), &quot;Rhodes Volume II&quot; (1986), &quot;Rearmament&quot; (1986) and &quot;Ecto&quot; (1987) were not conceived and recorded as album releases, but were a gathering together of songs recorded at Cathedral Sound Studios over several years. When fellow musician Kevin Bartlett offered to release Rhodes&#x27; songs on his cassette-only personal label Aural Gratification, Rhodes culled through the songs she had recorded and ordered them to her satisfaction. Rhodes I and Rhodes II are often considered to be a double album by fans because the songs are similar in theme and instrumentation. The third cassette, Rearmament, uses more electronic instrumentation and often displays the influence of Wendy Carlos. The fourth cassette, Ecto, contained a greater number of the more recent songs Rhodes had recorded and showed a greater maturity and complexity, foreshadowing the music Rhodes would make in the future.

=== 1991 – 1995 ===

Rhodes&#x27; first four albums were co-produced by Pat Tessitore and Rhodes, the 1991 album &quot;Warpaint&quot; was the first result of her collaboration with musician, producer, and Aural Gratification record label owner Kevin Bartlett, and the first to feature musicians other than Rhodes. During this period, the two formed a duo named, appropriately enough, &quot;Bartlett/Rhodes&quot;. They recorded several co-written songs and played a few dates, but the results were not generally considered successful, and they decided to continue on their endeavors. 1993 brought &quot;Equipoise&quot; an album of new material and Rhodesongs a compilation of music from Rhodes&#x27; first four albums, alternative versions, and a David Bowie cover. The cover of the 1994 album &quot;Building the Colossus&quot; commented on Rhodes&#x27; technically oriented fan base with an album sub-head of &quot;c:\happy Rhodes&quot; and featured Peter Gabriel collaborators Jerry Marotta and David Torn. This exceptionally productive period was capped with the 1995
compilation &quot;The Keep&quot;, featuring acoustic versions of earlier songs, the traditional Christmas song &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; and a medley of songs by the group Yes.

=== 1996 – present ===

After having entertained several traditional record company offers, and rejecting them due to an unwillingness to give up rights to her music, Rhodes assumed production and engineering duties on the 1998 release &quot;Many Worlds Are Born Tonight&quot;. Once the album was complete, she signed with a new label, Samson Music, and was able to tour the northeastern United States with a more elaborate stage show. The song &quot;Roy&quot; was released as a single and reached #42 on the Billboard Club Play/Dance Music chart. While sales were far greater than her previous albums, Samson eventually decided to concentrate on their Gold Circle Films division and dropped Rhodes. The parting was amicable, and the label returned her musical rights, as well as all unsold products.

In 2001 Rhodes recorded a new album, &quot;Find Me&quot;, but it was not released until 2007, although a limited-edition CD sampler consisting of 8 songs – &quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Chosen One&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Let Go&quot;, &quot;One And Many&quot;, &quot;Find Me&quot;, &quot;Here And Hereafter&quot; and &quot;She Won&#x27;t Go&quot; was sold at her 2005 concert. The album includes three additional songs – &quot;Treehouse&quot;, &quot;Little Brother&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot;. One additional song, &quot;Shutdown&quot;, was recorded for the album but is not on the official release.

Musicians on &quot;Find Me&quot; include guitarist Bon Lozaga and bassist Hansford Rowe of Gongzilla, bassist Carl Adami, guitarists Ted Kumpel and Jon Cather and pianist Rob Schwimmer.

In 2018 the Chicago-based record label The Numero Group released a retrospective compilation of 18 songs titled &quot;Happy Rhodes: Ectotrophia.&quot; The album package includes lyrics as well as extensive liner notes by Erin Osmon.

<doc id="311587" wikidata="Q2000932" url="?curid=311587" title="USS Ramage">
<text>USS &quot;Ramage&quot; (DDG-61) is the eleventh (Flight I) Aegis guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. The ship is named for Vice Admiral Lawson P. Ramage, a notable submarine commander and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II.

&quot;Ramage&quot; was laid down 4 January 1993 at the Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, launched 11 February 1994, sponsored by Barbara Ramage (wife of the admiral), and commissioned 22 July 1995.

==Construction==
&quot;Ramage&quot; was constructed utilizing efficient modular shipbuilding techniques pioneered by Ingalls in the 1970s and enhanced in recent years through the development of Product-Oriented Shipbuilding Technology (POST).

These innovative techniques allow a large ship, such as &quot;Ramage&quot;, to be built in three separate hull and superstructure modules and later joined to form the complete ship. Heavy machinery, such as propulsion equipment, as well as piping, duct work, and electrical cabling were installed in hundreds of sub-assemblies, which were joined to form dozens of assemblies. These assemblies were then joined to form the three hull modules. The ship&#x27;s superstructure, or &quot;deck house&quot;, was lifted atop the mid-body module early in the assembly process.

&quot;Ramage&quot;″s launching was as unique as her construction. The ship was moved over land via Ingalls&#x27; wheel-on-rail transfer system and onto the shipyard&#x27;s launch and recovery drydock. The drydock was ballasted down, and DDG-61 floated free on 11 February 1994. She was then moved to her outfitting dock in preparation for the traditional christening ceremony and completion of outfitting and testing.

==Service history==
===1996–2000===
On 25 November 1996, &quot;Ramage&quot; embarked on her maiden deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Ramage&quot; visited six countries and made 16 port calls. &quot;Ramage&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon, the Sea Service Ribbon, and the Armed Forces Service Medal during this deployment.

In March 1997 &quot;Ramage&quot; provided logistic and communications support for Marines in Albania during Operation Silver Wake. On 21 July 1997, &quot;Ramage&quot; was an escort of the museum ship when she set sail in Massachusetts Bay.
On 24 May 1999, as a member of the Battle Group, &quot;Ramage&quot; departed on her second deployment to the Mediterranean and Arabian Seas, MED/MEF 2–99. While deployed overseas, &quot;Ramage&quot; visited eight countries and made 15 port visits. &quot;Ramage&quot; also participated in Operation Allied Force off the coast of Montenegro.

===2001–2010===
Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, &quot;Ramage&quot; sortied to the waters off the East Coast of the United States where she provided extended radar coverage of the New York City and the surrounding area in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

&quot;Ramage&quot; deployed with the Surface Strike Group to the Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this deployment &quot;Ramage&quot; participated in multi-national exercises Neo Tapon 04 and Iron Siren 04.

&quot;Ramage&quot; again deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of the Global War on Terrorism in October 2006. While on station &quot;Ramage&quot; participated in Operations Argos Asterion and Argos Declion. &quot;Ramage&quot; was also the first ship to respond to the Horn of Africa during the Ethiopian and Somalian hostilities of late December 2006 providing extended coordination for P-3 coverage of the events. &quot;Ramage&quot; visited eight countries and conducted ten port calls.

In August 2008 &quot;Ramage&quot; departed for a seven-month deployment in the Persian Gulf with the Expeditionary Strike Group. &quot;Ramage&quot; participated in multi-national Operation Red Reef and Focused Operation Trident Knight. &quot;Ramage&quot; returned to home port in April 2009 after visiting four countries and making six port calls.

&quot;Ramage&quot; departed for the North Sea and Baltic Sea to participate in Exercise Joint Warrior 09 in September 2009. &quot;Ramage&quot; operated with and many other multi-national naval units. After making five ports of call in four countries, &quot;Ramage&quot; returned in November 2009. On 28 October 2009 while pierside at Gdynia, Poland after participating in a Joint Warrior exercise, a sailor on the ship conducting maintenance accidentally discharged one of the ship&#x27;s M240 machine guns into the port city. Two rounds from the gun&#x27;s three-round burst hit a warehouse, causing no injuries, the third round was not recovered. Local police allowed the ship to depart as originally scheduled later that day after questioning the ship&#x27;s crew.

&quot;Ramage&quot; departed on deployment to the Mediterranean Sea on 5 January 2010. In late January 2010, &quot;Ramage&quot; was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea to assist with the search-and-rescue effort in the wake of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 409. &quot;Ramage&quot; also provided Ballistic Missile Defense to the Eastern Mediterranean during this deployment. &quot;Ramage&quot;″s port visits included: Naples, Italy; Haifa, Israel; Kuşadası, Bodrum, and Aksaz, Turkey; Limassol, Cyprus; Rhodes, Greece; Augusta Bay, Sicily; and Ponta Delgada, Azores. &quot;Ramage&quot; returned to home port on 6 August 2010.

===2011–2020===
On 8 August 2013, &quot;Ramage&quot; departed for an eight-month deployment into the US Navy 6th Fleet area of responsibility to assist with ballistic missile defense. The ship&#x27;s last deployment was from May 2012 to January 2013.

&quot;Ramage&quot; entered the eastern Mediterranean Sea as a response to the Syrian Civil War. The destroyer was specifically deployed after allegations that President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime had used chemical weapons on its own people in suburbs of Damascus. &quot;Ramage&quot; arrived in the region, according to a defense official, on 23 August 2013. The destroyer was intended to replace , but &quot;Mahan&quot; remained in area temporarily along with and . All four were equipped with cruise missiles. On 28 October 2013, the destroyers &quot;Gravely&quot; and &quot;Ramage &quot; answered a distress call from a vessel carrying immigrants located off the coast of Kalamata, Greece.

In February 2014, &quot;Ramage&quot; was one of two U.S. Navy ships operating in the Black Sea during the Sochi Olympics. In August 2014, &quot;Ramage&quot; underwent testing and evaluation at Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY).

In November 2015, &quot;Ramage&quot; deployed to the US Navy 6th Fleet area of responsibility to assist with ballistic missile defense, and to escort the USS &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; carrier strike group. She completed 28 Strait of Hormuz transits throughout the deployment, and returned to her home port of Norfolk, Virginia on 25 July 2016. Following her 2015–2016 deployment&quot;, Ramage&quot; conducted her mid-cycle upgrade. As a result of the US Navy&#x27;s new coast-wide shipyard bidding process, she was selected for an unusual &quot;out of home port&quot; yard period, and spent a nine-month period in Pascagoula, Mississippi. &quot;Ramage&quot; left the yards on time, and returned to Norfolk, Virginia in August 2017 to begin workups for the next deployment.

In October 2018, &quot;Ramage&quot; received short-notice Presidential tasking, and deployed to the US Navy 4th fleet area of responsibility to provide radar surveillance support for the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She departed Norfolk, Virginia on 25 August 2018, and returned soon.

In late 2019, &quot;Ramage&quot; deployed to the US Navy 5th fleet area of responsibility as an independent ballistic missile defense operator. During this time, she was assigned as the flagship for Commander, Task Force 55, in a defensive response to the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. She took command of all US Naval surface forces in the 5th fleet area, positioning each ship in a strategic defensive manner.

===2021–2023===
On 9 August 2023, The Navy announced plans to extend the ship&#x27;s service life beyond the initial 35 years, intending to keep &quot;Ramage&quot; in service until at least 2035. On 8 October 2023, the day after the Hamas attack on Israel, the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, directed the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response. Along with the carrier, the group also includes the cruiser , and the destroyers &quot;Ramage&quot;, , and .

<text>The Stillaguamish people (; ) are a Southern Coast Salish people Indigenous to the Stillaguamish River valley in northwestern Washington State in the United States, near the city of Arlington, Washington. The Stillaguamish speak Northern Lushootseed, a Coast Salish language. Although usage of the language has declined, there are ongoing revitalization efforts by the Stillaguamish Tribe.

The Stillaguamish emerged after the end of the last glacial maximum, settling what is now the Stillaguamish River valley after the ice melted. For thousands of years, the Stillaguamish have lived along the Stillaguamish River. The modern Stillaguamish nation descends from the aboriginal Stillaguamish peoples who signed the Treaty of Point Elliot in 1855 as the Stoluck-wa-mish River Tribe. Although they were promised a reservation in the treaty, they were not given one, so while some Stillaguamish moved to Tulalip, the majority of Stillaguamish remained in their traditional territory. In 1976, the Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians was granted federal recognition, with a reservation being created in 2014. Today, most Stillaguamish people are enrolled in the Stillaguamish Tribe, while others are enrolled in the Tulalip Tribes.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Stillaguamish&quot; is an anglicization of their Lushootseed endonym, . The Lushootseed name means &quot;people of the river,&quot; from the root word meaning &quot;river&quot; and the suffix meaning &quot;people.&quot; The name is a drainage term, referring not to a central village but to all the people living along the Stillaguamish River.

==History==
The Stillaguamish people and their ancestors have lived in the region for thousands of years. Although the first humans could have arrived in the Pacific Northwest as early as 30,000 years ago, the first permanent human habitation of western Washington began 12,000 to 13,000 years ago after the last glacial maximum ended and the Vashon Glacier retreated. Archaeological sites dating back to the Olcott Phase (~9000 YBP) attributed to Stillaguamish Paleo-Indian ancestors have been discovered in Arlington and Granite Falls.

For thousands of years, the Stillaguamish have lived along the Stillaguamish River, fishing in it and its tributaries and hunting the surrounding country. The Stillaguamish were historically closely tied with neighboring peoples, such as the Snohomish, Sauk, and Skagit. Some Stillaguamish people were allied with peoples as far south as the Duwamish or even over the mountains from the plateau peoples. Warfare was uncommon, and generally defensive, as a retaliation for murder, broken promises, territory violations, or raiding.

Because of the Stillaguamish River&#x27;s remoteness, the Stillaguamish did not have much contact from Europeans prior to the signing of the Treaty.

On January 22, 1855, the Stillaguamish were party to the Treaty of Point Elliot, listed as the &quot;Stoluck-wa-mish.&quot; Although the Stillaguamish attended the signing and were listed on the treaty, they, along with one-third of the other tribes, were not included as signatories. The Stillaguamish were not included as signatories on the treaty because they were purposely placed as subjects of the Snoqualmie and their leader Patkanim. Anthropologist Barbara Lane concluded that, during the hastily conducted treaty negotiations, the Stillaguamish were likely completely overlooked by Issaac Stevens, the Territorial Governor at the time. It was Stevens&#x27; policy to lump together as many tribes as possible, so as to sign as few treaties as possible.

Despite being promised a reservation by then-Indian Agent Michael Simmons, no reservation was originally established in their homeland. Instead, the Stillaguamish were instructed to move to the Tulalip Reservation. While some moved to the Tulalip Reservation, many others resisted moving and stayed in their homelands along the Stillaguamish River. Some of those who moved to Tulalip were prevented from settling there, in part due to rampant disease at Tulalip, as well as a lack of land for all the people there, and eventually returned to their homelands. In 1881, only 3 Stillaguamish had remained at Tulalip, whose descendants make up the Stillaguamish community of Tulalip.

During the Puget Sound War, temporary reservations were created to further pacify the Indigenous peoples. The Stillaguamish were overlooked in the process, and a reservation was not set up for the Stillaguamish. In May 1856, the Stillaguamish were forced to move to the temporary reservation at Holmes Harbor on Whidbey Island, which was established for the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, and Skykomish peoples. Only one family remained, because they were too sick to leave. However, with the lack of food and water, and growing sickness on the Holmes Harbor reservation, the Stillaguamish had returned to their homelands by July, refusing to return to a reservation until the government negotiated a better deal.

The Stillaguamish continued their traditional lifestyle for at least 15 years after they refused to leave to a reservation, until the 1870s, when settlers began encroaching.

===Federal recognition===

The Stillaguamish Tribe of Washington ratified its constitution on January 31, 1953, establishing a democratically elected, six-member tribal council.

In 1974, the Stillaguamish Tribe petitioned for recognition from the United States&#x27; government. The Stillaguamish Tribe achieved federal recognition and treaty on October 27, 1976.

In 2003, the enrolled population of the Stillaguamish Tribe was 237. The Stillaguamish Tribe manages the salmon populations in the Stillaguamish River watershed with the help of Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife. As part of this effort, the Stillaguamish Tribe has a hatchery which releases Chinook and coho salmon, running educational activities about salmon.

In 2014, the Stillaguamish Tribe was granted a reservation specifically for the Stillaguamish. The 64-acre reservation was established near the Stillaguamish River, downriver from the former village at .

== Territory and land usage ==
The traditional territory of the Stillaguamish extends along the drainage of the Stillaguamish River, including the North and South forks, and the main course. The Stillaguamish also utilized the coastline of Skagit Bay and Camano Island, along with members from other non-Stillaguamish villages.

Traditionally, there was limited private property ownership, and territorial rights were dominated by the idea of land use, extending to individuals based on the location of their village and usual and accustomed hunting and gathering areas.

Territorial rights also differed between the seasons. During the winter months, the exclusive rights to fishing stations along a river would be held by the local village. During the summer, the rights would be extended to those who were not from the village, but were tied in kinship to members of the village. Land rights were also granted to those who were not tied in kinship but had express permission to use hunting and gathering sites. These requests were often a formality, and were rarely denied.

The understanding of territory was constantly in flux, as kinship rights between individuals would repeatedly be redefined. Despite this, boundaries were well understood, especially around villages and certain important harvesting sites. Fishing stations and certain important gathering areas close to a village were closely controlled by their owners. However, the farther one traveled from a village, the less defined the boundaries became. Rural hunting and gathering areas were not tightly controlled and open to most, and many different groups would socialize and intermingle in those areas.

Territory sharing between tribes was common and reciprocal, and Stillaguamish people who shared their land with their neighbors would be sure to use their neighbors&#x27; land.

=== Villages ===
Like other Coast Salish cultures, the Stillaguamish were not migratory; they had permanent villages and structures which sometimes hundreds of people would live in. A village was made up of several winter longhouses, seasonal cattail mat houses, and various structures such as drying racks or fire pits. Longhouses were communally occupied by large groups of extended families.

Each village along the Stillaguamish River had fish traps of some sort in the nearby river, which were owned privately by a family.

Traditionally, Stillaguamish villages were autonomous, loosely bound together in culture, language, kinship, and geography. During times of crisis, war, or simply for large social activities, closely allied villages might band together, sometimes under the leadership of one or several powerful figures. However, this was only temporary and villages remained independent.

=== Summer camping grounds ===
During the summer, Stillaguamish people from villages along the whole river would traditionally use certain areas as base camps for summer activities like hunting and fishing. Some of these locations were built around villages, while others were purely seasonal campgrounds. The villages at and what is now Hazel had campgrounds for people visiting from all along the river, as well as for people visiting from other tribes. The village at had many small cabins which would be utilized by families visiting the lower Stillaguamish River.

Other locations, such as near what is now Oso, were general areas which anyone could use. The campgrounds at Oso were used as a launching spot for expeditions into the mountains and forests for hunting and berry picking. There were many of these such places between Pilchuck Creek and .

On , known in English as Mount Higgins, there was possibly the most important of these sites. In the alpine meadows there was a large longhouse used seasonally, as well as many drying racks and a large fireplace. People from all over the Stillaguamish River valley would come to this camp in great numbers to hunt bear, deer, elk, and mountain goat, as well as gather many types of berries.
, often anglicized as Quadsak or Quadsack, is the name which was given to those living along the lowest reaches of the Stillaguamish River. The name means &quot;yellow people,&quot; from meaning &quot;yellow&quot; and the suffixes meaning &quot;people.&quot; The name refers to their unique practice of painting themselves yellow, rather than the traditional red.

Originally, the Quadsack were a separate group from (but very closely-tied with) the Stillaguamish proper. After the first Smallpox epidemic in the 18th century, the Quadsack population was decimated while the upriver Stillaguamish were slightly less affected, and thus, over the coming century, effectively became part of the Stillaguamish proper. Anthropologist Sally Snyder, expert witness for the Stillaguamish in their case before the Indian Claims Commission, testified that the Quadsack villages were mixed-use by the Stillaguamish and Quadsack after the epidemic. The village at was a mixed village of the Stillaguamish, Quadsack, and Snohomish. According to anthropologist Colin Tweddell, the Quadsack as a whole were a subgroup of the Snohomish.

== Culture and society ==

=== Language ===

The Stillaguamish traditionally speak a subdialect of Northern Lushootseed, called . In modern times, usage of the language has decreased to the point where there are no longer native speakers, and it is generally used in ceremonies. Despite this, there are still many second-language speakers and the Stillaguamish Tribe is engaging in revitalizing the language. The Stillaguamish Tribe has a YouTube channel where they post language-learning material.

=== Societal structure ===
The Stillaguamish traditionally had a class society with three classes: upper class (), commoners, and slaves (). The vast majority of people were upper class, with a small minority of commoners, made up of freed slaves, refugees, orphans, and others who were otherwise ostracized from society. The slave class was by far the smallest. Slaves were former prisoners of war, and war was relatively infrequent. Only the wealthiest and most prestigious owned slaves.

Society was traditionally dominated by the village and the family. There was no formal social organization higher the village until the colonial period, when extended villages and modern tribes arose as powerful leaders consolidated power. One would identify primarily with the village they were from, and beyond that, their family was most important.

=== Resources and sustenance ===
Both in ancient and modern times, cedar is one of the most important resources of the Stillaguamish. The bark, wood, and roots of cedar can all be used. Cedar wood is used for crafting house posts, canoes, houses, storage, and more. The bark is used for making rope, and weaving baskets, hats, clothing, and mats. The bark is also used in medicine, food, and some weaving of textiles.

The primary food resource for the Stillaguamish is salmon. Salmon were once plentiful in the rivers, and were caught at fishing stations, with traps, or with spears. Each village would have a fishing station, such as a weir or large fish trap, where salmon and other fish were caught for eating fresh, smoking, or drying. There were two large weirs on the Stillaguamish at the villages at what are now Florence and Trafton. Early settlers and visitors to the territory of the Stillaguamish thought their talent for fishing in even the most turbulent waters was remarkable. Even today, many Stillaguamish people largely rely on fishing salmon as a means of gathering food and for economic gain.

The Stillaguamish traditionally both hunted and domesticated animals. Animals were traditionally hunted primarily for food and clothing, as well as trading with other groups. The primary animals hunted were deer, elk, bear, and mountain goat. The area north of up to Pilchuck Creek and Lake Cavanaugh were prime places for getting deer. Stillaguamish people also traveled to areas used by other tribes, like the Snohomish, Skykomish, and Sauk, to hunt. The Stillaguamish were famed for their skills in hunting mountain goat up on Three Fingers Mountain () and Whitehorse Mountain (), and commonly invited other tribes to hunt with them in return for hunting privileges elsewhere.

The Stillaguamish domesticated the Salish Wool Dog, shaving them for their wool. They were kept separate from other animals in special areas, and highly cared for so as to maintain their coat. Both mountain goat wool and dog wool was used for weaving blankets and clothing, both of which were highly valuable in trading.

The Stillaguamish maintain a tradition of gathering plants in the forests, prairies, and alpine meadows in their territory. Traditionally, prairies were maintained and plants growing there were semi-domesticated. Slash-and-burn techniques were used to encourage new growth of plants and facilitate animal species. One of the most prolific prairies used by the Stillaguamish was at what is now Kent Prairie (), in Arlington. It was a plentiful source of many crops, such as camas, as well as various berries, grasses, and weeds and the only prairie within the core territory of the Stillaguamish. The Stillaguamish who were allied with the Sauk would also travel to Sauk Prairie to gather roots there. The Stillaguamish also gathered berries with their Snohomish allies at Kellogg Marsh, in what is now Marysville ().

Potatoes began being planted after their introduction. They were first planted at the village between Florence and Silvana, and soon after they had spread to many of the Stillaguamish villages where they were maintained around the village, and planted at prairies like at .

=== Houses ===

The Stillaguamish traditionally had several types of housing. During the summer, temporary houses made of cattail mats or small, temporary longhouses were erected, while during the winter, the Stillaguamish lived in great cedar longhouses.

The winter lodgings of the Stillaguamish were large cedar plank longhouses, furnished from long cedar boards and rope made from cedar bark, with the interior walls covered with large woven cattail mats. On the inside, longhouses had large fire pits for heating and cooking in the center, and there were sleeping and storage platforms were built into the walls. Multiple families, generally part of the same extended family, would live together in different sections of the house. Each family in a house owned the roof planks which covered their section. Winter longhouses were built by professional carpenters, who masterfully crafted the planks with specialized tools. 40–50 men could build a longhouse in about 3–4 months.

The Stillaguamish also built large fortified longhouses called stronghouses, where trade goods and other valuables were kept. The village at Cubial had a 150-foot-long stronghouse that was fortified with spikes and traps along the entire perimeter.

=== Transportation ===
The traditional primary vessel of the Stillaguamish is the river canoe. As they live on the swift-flowing Stillaguamish, they were experts at navigating the currents. Canoes were poled upriver and would ride the current downriver. The North Fork, having many settlements up and down the whole river and always being full of canoes, was called a sort of highway between Skagit Bay and the Sauk River by early mountaineer Nels Bruseth. When traveling overland, canoes would be picked up and carried. There were several commonly used portages at Barlow Pass, Granite Falls, and near Darrington. Indian Pass between the Sauk and White Rivers was used for travel across the Cascades.

<doc id="311596" wikidata="Q409641" url="?curid=311596" title="Allicin">
<text>Allicin is an organosulfur compound obtained from garlic and leeks. When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin into allicin, which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. Allicin is unstable and quickly changes into a series of other sulfur-containing compounds such as diallyl disulfide. Allicin is an antifeedant, i.e. the defense mechanism against attacks by pests on the garlic plant.

Allicin is an oily, slightly yellow liquid that gives garlic its distinctive odor. It is a thioester of sulfenic acid. It is also known as allyl thiosulfinate. Its biological activity can be attributed to both its antioxidant activity and its reaction with thiol-containing proteins. 

==Structure and occurrence==
Allicin features the thiosulfinate functional group, R-S-(O)-S-R. The compound is not present in garlic unless tissue damage occurs, and is formed by the action of the enzyme alliinase on alliin. Allicin is chiral but occurs naturally only as a racemate. The racemic form can also be generated by oxidation of diallyl disulfide:
:(SCH2CH=CH2)2 + 2 RCO3H + H2O → 2 CH2=CHCH2SOH + 2 RCO2H
:2 CH2=CHCH2SOH → CH2=CHCH2S(O)SCH2CH=CH2 + H2O

Alliinase is irreversibly deactivated below pH 3; as such, allicin is generally not produced in the body from the consumption of fresh or powdered garlic. Furthermore, allicin can be unstable, breaking down within 16 hours at 23 °C.

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthesis of allicin commences with the conversion of cysteine into &quot;S&quot;-allyl--cysteine. Oxidation of this thioether gives the sulfoxide (alliin). The enzyme alliinase, which contains pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), cleaves alliin, generating allylsulfenic acid (CH2=CHCH2SOH), pyruvate, and ammonium ions. At room temperature, two molecules of allylsulfenic acid condense to form allicin.

==Research==
Allicin has been studied for its potential to treat various kinds of multiple drug resistance bacterial infections, as well as viral and fungal infections in vitro, but as of 2016, the safety and efficacy of allicin to treat infections in people was unclear.

A Cochrane review found there to be insufficient clinical evidence regarding the effects of allicin in preventing or treating common cold.

==History==
It was first isolated and studied in the laboratory by Chester J. Cavallito and John Hays Bailey in 1944. 
Allicin was discovered as part of efforts to create thiamine derivatives in the 1940s, mainly in Japan. Allicin became a model for medicinal chemistry efforts to create other thiamine disulfides. The results included sulbutiamine, fursultiamine (thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide) and benfothiamine. These compounds are hydrophobic, easily pass from the intestines to the bloodstream, and are reduced to thiamine by cysteine or glutathione.

<text>Kiryat Yam (, lit. &quot;Sea Town&quot;) is a city in the Haifa Bay district of Israel, north of Haifa. One of a group of Haifa suburbs known as the Krayot, it is located on the Mediterranean coast, between Kiryat Haim and the Tzur Shalom industrial area, east of Kiryat Motzkin. In it had a population of .

==History==

The area was acquired by the Jewish community as part of the Sursock Purchase, in which a large tract of land on the Haifa Bay was purchased from the Sursock family of Beirut by the American Zion Commonwealth in 1925. In 1928, the Bayside Land Corporation, a joint venture of the Palestine Economic Corporation and the Jewish National Fund, acquired 2,400 dunams of residential land in a deal related to the building of the IPC oil pipeline. Development of a residential area began in 1939, and the first houses were completed in 1940.

==Demographics==

Kiryat Yam has a population of 38,945. The northern area of the city is home to many immigrants from the former Soviet Union, North Africa and Ethiopia in which the municipality and its mayor Shmuel Sisso worked to build dozens of centers and homes to help the immigrants settle. The city is ranked medium on the socio-economic scale.

==Schools==
Kiryat Yam has 15 preschools, eight elementary schools and 3 high schools (Rabin, Rodman &amp; Levinson) with a student population of 10,000. In 2015 Rodman High School was merged with Rabin high school. The merging caused overcrowding at Rabin High School, resulting in overload and malfunction of public facilities and adjustment struggles of adolescents. Most of elementary schools and junior highs are included in public transport routes. Rabin high school was detached in circa 2015 from a particular bus line. The line has not been returned in spite of requests sent to the local municipality about the overcrowding and malfunction of public facilities.

==Israeli-Arab conflict==
During the 2006 Lebanon War, Kiryat Yam was hit by Hezbollah rockets and suffered casualties and property damage.

==Urban development==
Urban development plans aimed at upgrading the old Gimmel neighborhood were blocked by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, whose main weapons development plant borders Kiryat Yam. In 2009, the Haifa district planning committee approved high-rise construction for the neighborhood, overruling Rafael&#x27;s objections.

==Neighbourhoods==
*Kiryat Yam (Dalet) - including Almogim
*Kiryat Yam (Gimmel) - built in the 1950s
*Kiryat Yam (Bet)

<doc id="311603" wikidata="Q510753" url="?curid=311603" title="Ramón Serrano Suñer">
<text>Ramón Serrano Suñer (12 September 1901 – 1 September 2003), was a Spanish politician during the first stages of the Francoist dictatorship, between 1938 and 1942, when he held the posts of President of the FET y de las JONS caucus (1936), and then Interior Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister. A neofalangist originally from the CEDA, Serrano Suñer came to embody the most totalitarian impetus within the regime. Serrano Suñer was known for his pro-Third Reich stance during World War II, when he supported the sending of the Blue Division to fight along with the Wehrmacht on the Russian front. He was also the brother-in-law of Francisco Franco&#x27;s wife Carmen Polo, for which he was informally nicknamed &quot;Cuñadísimo&quot; or the &quot;most brother-in-law&quot; (in comparison, the dictator himself was styled as &quot;generalísimo&quot;).

Serrano Suñer was the founder of the 67,000-strong Spanish blind people&#x27;s organization ONCE on 13 December 1938, as well as of the EFE press-agency, in 1939. Serrano Suñer also founded the Radio Intercontinental radio network in 1950.

==Early life==
He was born Ramón Serrano Suñer in Cartagena, the fifth of seven children born to an engineer working in the Valencian port of Castelló de la Plana. Although he was an excellent student, his father disapproved of his plans to become a lawyer. He enrolled at Madrid&#x27;s Central University to study law, just the same. A fellow student of José Antonio Primo de Rivera (son of Spanish dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera, and founder of the Falange), he developed a taste for falangism while spending a year in Bologna.

He joined the State Lawyers Corps in 1924.

Ramón Serrano Suñer and Francisco Franco were co-brothers-in-law, since the two married two sisters: Serrano Suñer married Ramona (Zita) Polo y Martínez-Valdés, in Oviedo on 6 February 1932, whom he had met shortly after moving to Zaragoza in 1931. Franco married Carmen Polo y Martínez-Valdés in October 1923. Ramón Serrano Suñer and Zita Polo had six children: Fernando, Francisco, Jaime Javier, José, María del Pilar and Ramón Serrano-Suñer y Polo.

 was Ramón Serrano Suñer&#x27;s illegitimate daughter by the Marquis of Llanzol&#x27;s wife but he never recognized her. Not knowing they were half-siblings, Carmen and Ramón Serrano Suñer y Polo fell in love and were only prevented from marrying at the last minute. She later became the Chief of Cabinet, ranking as Secretary of State, under Adolfo Suarez&#x27;s right wing coalition and later as a socialist member of the European Parliament.

==Early political career==
Suñer was a member of the Cortes within the group of the right-wing CEDA although he did not formally join in the CEDA. Prior to the Spanish Civil War, he distanced himself from the CEDA and approached the Falange Española de las JONS but did not join it either. He had called the members of the youth wing JAP to flee to the Falange in the spring of 1936. After the military coup of July 1936 and the outbreak of the civil war, he was locked in a Republican prison. He escaped in October 1936, dressed as a woman, and was then helped by the Argentine navy in getting to France, from where he was able to reach Salamanca on 20 February 1937, where Franco was in office at the time. It was there that he could work with Franco to participate for the rebels in the civil war.

In 1938, Serrano Suñer went to Nuremberg with Nicolás Franco, Franco&#x27;s brother, probably to the 10th Nuremberg Rally (&quot;Reichsparteitag Grossdeutschland&quot; in German) of the Nazi Party, to celebrate the Anschluss, the union of Austria with Germany, in March.

Serrano Suñer served as Nationalist Minister of the Interior (1 February 1938 – 9 August 1939). When Franco amalgamated that ministry with the Ministry of Public Order (&quot;Ministerio de Orden Público&quot; in Spanish), a new name was created, the &quot;Ministerio de la Gobernación&quot;, but the new name is now usually translated as &quot;Ministry of the Interior&quot;. The merger was made by Franco on 9 August 1939, when Serrano Suñer became &quot;Ministro de la Gobernación&quot;.

Suñer also managed to re-elaborate the statutes of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS, decreasing the political power of the Secretary General in favour of a newly created office, the President of the Political Council, to which he was appointed on 9 August 1936. He felt the office of &quot;Gobernación&quot; on 16 October 1940. Just the day before, 15 October 1940, the former president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Lluis Companys, had been executed by firing squad in Barcelona. On 13 August, Companys had been handed over by the Gestapo authorities of occupied Paris to the Spanish policeman and spy Pedro Urraca Rendueles, along with the extradition of Basque Minister of the Interior Julián Zugazagoitia, who had served under Republican Prime Minister Juan Negrín.

While Serrano Suñer had been Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Foreign Affairs was General Juan Luis Beigbeder y Atienza, formerly a Military Attaché at the Spanish Embassy Berlin as an Army Commandant in 1926. Already as a colonel, he was the predecessor of Serrano Suñer as a Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs.

In September 1940, the strongly pro-Axis Serrano Suñer visited Berlin to meet the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to discuss how Spain might best enter the war on the Axis side. During the meeting, Serrano Suñer presented a &quot;shopping list&quot; to Ribbentrop, saying Spain wanted Gibraltar from the British; all of French Morocco and Algeria &quot;which belonged to Spain&#x27;s &quot;Lebensraum&quot;&quot;; and about Portugal, he said: &quot;Geographically speaking, Portugal has no right to exist&quot;. Additionally, Serrano Suñer wanted generous promises of German military and economic support before Spain entered the war. Serrano Suñer and Ribbentrop did not get along and they soon developed an intense mutual hatred of one another. Ribbentrop told Serrano Suñer that in return for military and economic aid and allowing the return of Gibraltar, Germany wanted to annex at least one of the Canary Islands (Ribbentrop stated that he preferred Germany to have all of the Canaries but was prepared to be magnanimous by taking only one); that Germany be allowed air and naval bases in Spanish Morocco with extraterritorial rights; German companies to be given control of the mines in Spanish Morocco; and finally Ribbentrop wanted an economic treaty that would have turned Spain into an economic colony of Germany. For the pro-Axis Serrano Suñer, who had been expecting the Germans to treat Spain as an ally and an equal, to learn that the Germans viewed Spain as little more than a satellite state was a great shock. During his visits to Berlin, Serrano Suñer, who had started to rethink the wisdom of Spain entering the war, was overruled by Franco, who was keen to enter the war as soon as possible on the Axis side before Britain was defeated. Franco, in his letters to Serrano Suñer, praised Hitler as a wise statesman and dismissed Ribbentrop&#x27;s demands as the product of a man who failed to appreciate properly what Spain had to offer the Axis.


Meanwhile, even on becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs, Serrano Suñer had to accept Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart y Falcó, 17th Duke of Alba, as ambassador to London, who, since November 1937 represented the rebellious Franco and, from March 1939, represented Francisco Franco until March 1945. He had been formerly a Minister of Public Instruction, later Minister of State, 1930–1931, under the dictatorship of General Dámaso Berenguer.

In June 1939, Serrano Suñer had been back to Italy to present Benito Mussolini with the thousands of repatriated Italian soldiers who had fought by the side of Franco in Spain against the Republicans. He was appointed the 263rd Minister of Foreign Affairs (18 October 1940 – 3 September 1942) because of his skill at building a relationship with Mussolini.

Even though he was working with Franco, he objected to the increasing role of the Catholic Church in Falangist politics. The two brothers-in-law had some intraparty conflicts of their own, as Serrano Suñer accused Franco of riding on a &quot;cult of personality&quot;, and Franco viewed Serrano Suñer as increasingly becoming a thorn in the side of his party who criticised too many of its policies.

==Involvement in World War II==
Just one week after Serrano Suñer was promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs, on 23 October 1940, Franco and Adolf Hitler met at the Hendaye railway station in France, near the Spanish border. There, Serrano Suñer met with Ribbentrop. Paul Schmidt, head interpreter of the German Chancellor, reported that Franco sat between Ribbentrop and Walther von Brauchitsch, while Adolf Hitler sat between the Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister Ramón Serrano Suñer and the Spanish Ambassador at Berlin, Eugenio Espinosa de los Monteros. However, neither the Spanish Ambassador at Berlin nor the German Ambassador at Madrid, Eberhard von Stohrer, were allowed at the exhaustive and inconclusive political meetings. By morning the meeting ended with no compromise. Serrano Suñer was later to say of the Hendaye summit that because of General Franco&#x27;s obsession with Morocco, that if only Hitler had offered him French Morocco, then Spain would have entered the war in October 1940.

Although Serrano Suñer had played a major role in establishing the Spanish state under Franco, being so influential as to be nicknamed the &quot;Cuñadísimo&quot;, which translates as supreme brother-in-law (a joke on &quot;Generalísimo&quot;), and despite Serrano Suñer&#x27;s advocating Spain&#x27;s joining the Axis powers, Franco opted for Spain to remain a nonbelligerent during World War II. Serrano Suñer&#x27;s protégé, Pedro Gamero del Castillo, consulted in January 1941 with Hans Lazar, the press secretary of the German embassy, and told him that a Serrano Suñer government would commit to the Axis powers and thus asked for him to arrange for the Nazis to back his mentor publicly. However, it is unclear whether Gamero was working on his own initiative and Hitler was disappointed that Serrano Suñer had not tried harder to help Germany and called him the &quot;gravedigger of the new Spain&quot;.

To make up for that failure, Serrano Suñer proposed the Blue Division of Spanish volunteers to fight with the Germans against the Soviet Union after Operation Barbarossa, which started on 22 June 1941. On 23 June, upon receiving the news, he met with Franco in El Pardo, and the Council of Ministers passed a resolution thereafter concerning the sending of a division of Spanish volunteers to the front. A day after, on 24 June, he declaimed his famous invective () rallying a revanchist mood during a speech delivered from the balcony of the FET-JONS headquarters.

On 25 November 1941 he signed in Berlin the revision of the pact of 25 November 1936 Germany–Japan Anti-Comintern Pact, an anticommunist pact concluded between Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan (later to be joined by other countries) directed against the Communist International (Comintern) or Komintern.

In September 1942, following the Basilica of Begoña incident of August 1942, Serrano Suñer was forced to resign as foreign minister and president of the political council of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS.

==Later life==
After World War II, he wrote a persuasive letter to Franco, calling for a transitional government that would have room for intellectuals in exile. When Franco received the letter, he wrote a derisive &quot;Ho-ho.&quot; in its margin. Serrano Suñer ultimately retired from public life in 1947.

In 1949, Serrano Suñer sponsored the visit to Spain of British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley, taking him to the tomb of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. In 1961, in the context of the Algiers putsch against French president Charles De Gaulle, Serrano Suñer was the main Spanish support to Raoul Salan during the latter&#x27;s spell in Spain, and provided for Salan&#x27;s transfer to Algeria so he could carry out the attempted generals&#x27; coup in April. Also by that time, Serrano operated too as a link between Salan and Portuguese dictator Oliveira Salazar, an enthusiastic supporter of Salan&#x27;s putschist intentions.

Serrano Suñer died on 1 September 2003 in Madrid, eleven days before his 102nd birthday.

<text>The Battle of Latakia (; ) was a small but revolutionary naval action of the Yom Kippur War, fought on 7 October 1973 between Israel and Syria. It was the first naval battle in history to see combat between surface-to-surface missile-equipped missile boats and the use of electronic deception.

==Background==
At the outset of hostilities, the Israeli Navy set out to destroy the naval capabilities of the Syrians, who were equipped with Soviet Komar-class and Osa-class missile boats. The Syrian missile boats were equipped with Soviet manufactured P-15 Termit (NATO reporting name: SS-N-2 &quot;Styx&quot;) anti-ship missiles with twice the range of the Israeli Gabriel anti-ship missiles.

==Battle==

At the beginning of the Yom Kippur War, the Israeli Navy carried out a raid against the Syrian port of Latakia. For this, the Israelis sent five missile boats and two landing ships with four helicopters. The helicopters had ESM, chaff, and mechanical–electronic echo enhancement equipment. The aim of the strike force was to carry out missile and gun attacks on the Syrian port. The helicopters were to be used for surface surveillance, EW, and gun spotting and as decoys.

The four Israeli Navy Sa&#x27;ar 3-class and one Sa&#x27;ar 4-class missile boats headed towards the Syrian port of Latakia in two parallel columns. In the western column were the missile boats &quot;Miznak&quot; (Blast), &quot;Ga&#x27;ash&quot; (Storm), and &quot;Hanit&quot; (Spear); the eastern column was composed of the missile boats &quot;Mivtach&quot; (Reliance) and &quot;Reshef&quot; (Spark).

The Israeli missile boats were detected by a patrolling Syrian torpedo boat and this detection was reported to the base. But before any reinforcements could be sent, at 22:28 hours the Israelis encountered the Syrian K-123 torpedo boat which was attacked using Gabriel SSMs and sunk by 76 mm gunfire from &quot;Mivtach&quot; and &quot;Hanit&quot;. As they headed toward the shore, the Israeli ships engaged a 560-ton Syrian T43-class minesweeper and also sank it, this time using four Gabriel anti-ship missiles. At 23:30, the Israelis made contact with two Syrian Komar-class and one Osa-class missile boats. The Israeli force turned East South Eastwards, and the helicopters climbed high so as to be detected by the shore radar at Latakia. In the meantime, three patrolling Syrian missile boats from off Bans were vectored northwest to attack the Israeli formation of seven radar contacts (three chaff clouds and four helicopters). At about 2330, the Syrians launched eight to twelve Styx missiles at the Israeli formation, which subsequently disappeared from the Syrian radar. The Syrian missile boats fired their Styx missiles at long range, but as the missiles approached, the Israelis employed electronic countermeasures and launched chaff rockets to successfully decoy the missiles. When the Israeli ships closed the range, they fired five Gabriel missiles, sinking one Komar and the Osa immediately and damaging the second Komar. The surviving Syrian Komar tried to escape, but it ran aground in shallow water and was destroyed by 76 mm cannon fire at 00:26 hours.

During this naval clash, other Syrian missile boats launched missiles from within the port limits of Latakia (actually launched while the missile boats were moored between merchant ships in port). However, these missiles malfunctioned or lost guidance, and two foreign (one Greek and one Japanese) merchant vessels anchored along the piers were hit. Both vessels were struck in the engine rooms.

The Syrian Navy remained bottled up in its home ports for the rest of the war.

While the Battle of Latakia was the first naval battle in history between missile boats, it was not the first incident in which a missile boat sank another ship using missiles. That had happened when two Egyptian Navy Komar-class missile boats sank the British-built Israeli destroyer &quot;Eilat&quot; on 21 October 1967, shortly after the Six-Day War, using four P-15 Termit surface-to-surface missiles.

<text>Žilina (; ; ; ; names in other languages) is a city in north-western Slovakia, around from the capital Bratislava, close to both the Czech and Polish borders. It is the fourth largest city of Slovakia with a population of approximately 80,000, an important industrial center, the largest city on the Váh river, and the seat of a &quot;kraj&quot; (Žilina Region) and of an &quot;okres&quot; (Žilina District). It belongs to the Upper Váh region of tourism.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from Slavic/Slovak word &quot;žila&quot; - a &quot;(river) vein&quot;. Žilina means &quot;a place with many watercourses&quot;. Alternatively, it is a secondary name derived from Žilinka river or from the name of the local people, Žilín/Žiliňane.

==History==

The area around today&#x27;s Žilina was inhabited in the late Stone Age (about 20,000 BC). In the 5th century, Slavs started to move into the area. However, the first written reference to Žilina was in 1208 as &quot;terra de Selinan&quot;. From the second half of the 10th century until 1918, it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the middle of the 13th century, &quot;terra Sylna&quot; was the property of the Cseszneky de Milvány family. The city started to develop around 1300, and, according to records in 1312, it was already a town. In 1321, King Charles I made Žilina a free royal town. On 7 May 1381, King Louis I issued Privilegium pro Slavis, which made the Slav inhabitants equal to the Germans by allocating half of the seats at the city council to Slavs. The town was burned in 1431 by the Hussites.

During the 17th century, Žilina gained position as a center of manufacturing, trade, and education, and, during the Baroque age, many monasteries and churches, as well as the Budatín Castle, were built. In the Revolutions of 1848, Slovak volunteers, part of the Imperial Army, won a battle near the city against Hungarian honveds and gardists.

The city boomed in the second half of the 19th century as new railway tracks were built: the Kassa Oderberg Railway was finished in 1872 and the railway to Bratislava (Pozsony in Hungarian) in 1883, and new factories started to spring up, such as the drapery factory &quot;Slovena&quot; (1891) and the Považie chemical works (1892).

It was one of the first municipalities to sign the Martin Declaration (30 October 1918), and until March 1919, it was the seat of the Slovak government. On 6 October 1938, shortly after the Munich Agreement, the autonomy of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia was declared in Žilina.

During the Holocaust in Slovakia, tens of thousands of Jews were deported from Žilina. Žilina was captured on 30 April 1945 by Czechoslovak and Soviet troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front, after which it again became part of Czechoslovakia. 
After the war, the city continued its development with many new factories, schools and housing projects being built. It was the seat of the Žilina Region from 1949 to 1960 and again since 1996.

Today, Žilina is the fourth largest city in Slovakia, the third most important industrial center and the seat of a university, the Žilinská univerzita (founded in 1953). Since 1990 the historical center of the city has been largely restored and the city has built trolleybus lines.

==Education==
The city is home to the University of Žilina, which has seven faculties and 12,402 students, including 625 doctoral students.

There are 18 public primary schools, one private primary school, and three church primary schools. Overall, they enroll 7,484 pupils. The city&#x27;s system of secondary education (some middle schools and all high schools) consists of eight gymnasia with 3,514 students, ten specialized high schools with 3,696 students, and nine vocational schools with 4,870 students.

==Transport==
The city is an important international road junction, and Žilina railway station is a major rail junction.

Roads and railways connect the city with Bratislava and Prievidza in the south, Čadca in the north, and Martin in the east. The construction of the D1, and D3 motorways and their feeders continues towards Žilina.

The city is also served by international Žilina Airport, which is about away from the city center.

Public transport within the city is operated by DPMZ and consists of buses (since 1949) and trolleybuses (since 1994).

Night bus services started in Žilina in 1970 with the introduction of one route, the 50, which continues to operate as the sole night bus in the city, operating from 22:55 to 04:22. Route 50 makes a circuitous route of all major residential areas, and includes a stop at Železničná stanica, the principal railway station.

<doc id="311615" wikidata="Q46408" url="?curid=311615" title="Georgia O'Keeffe">
<text>Georgia Totto O&#x27;Keeffe (November 15, 1887 March 6, 1986) was an American modernist painter and draftswoman whose career spanned seven decades and whose work remained largely independent of major art movements. Called the &quot;Mother of American modernism&quot;, O&#x27;Keeffe gained international recognition for her paintings of natural forms, particularly flowers and desert-inspired landscapes, which were often drawn from and related to places and environments in which she lived.

From 1905, when O&#x27;Keeffe began her studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, until about 1920, she studied art or earned money as a commercial illustrator or a teacher to pay for further education. Influenced by Arthur Wesley Dow, O&#x27;Keeffe began to develop her unique style beginning with her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. Alfred Stieglitz, an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1917. Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the Teachers College, Columbia University.

She moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz&#x27;s request and began working seriously as an artist. They developed a professional and personal relationship that led to their marriage on December 11, 1924. O&#x27;Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including close-ups of flowers, such as the &quot;Red Canna&quot; paintings, that many found to represent vulvas, though O&#x27;Keeffe consistently denied that intention. The imputation of the depiction of women&#x27;s sexuality was also fueled by explicit and sensuous photographs of O&#x27;Keeffe that Stieglitz had taken and exhibited.

O&#x27;Keeffe and Stieglitz lived together in New York until 1929, when O&#x27;Keeffe began spending part of the year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of New Mexico landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as &quot;Cow&#x27;s Skull: Red, White, and Blue&quot; (1931) and &quot;Summer Days&quot; (1936)&quot;.&quot; After Stieglitz&#x27;s death in 1946, she lived in New Mexico for the next 40 years at her home and studio or Ghost Ranch summer home in Abiquiú, and in the last years of her life, in Santa Fe. In 2014, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s 1932 painting &quot;Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1&quot; sold for $44,405,000—at the time, by far the largest price paid for any painting by a female artist. Her works are in the collections of several museums, and following her death, the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum was established in Santa Fe.

==Early life and education (1887–1916)==
Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O&#x27;Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O&#x27;Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her mother&#x27;s father, George Victor Totto, for whom O&#x27;Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848.

O&#x27;Keeffe was the second of seven children. She attended Town Hall School in Sun Prairie. By age 10, she had decided to become an artist. With her sisters, Ida and Anita, she received art instruction from local watercolorist Sara Mann. O&#x27;Keeffe attended high school at Sacred Heart Academy in Madison, Wisconsin, as a boarder between 1901 and 1902. In late 1902, the O&#x27;Keeffes moved from Wisconsin to the close-knit neighborhood of Peacock Hill in Williamsburg, Virginia, where O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s father started a business making rusticated cast concrete block in anticipation of a demand for the block in the Virginia Peninsula building trade, but the demand never materialized. O&#x27;Keeffe stayed in Wisconsin attending Madison Central High School until joining her family in Virginia in 1903. She completed high school as a boarder at Chatham Episcopal Institute in Virginia (now Chatham Hall), graduating in 1905. At Chatham, she was a member of Kappa Delta sorority.

O&#x27;Keeffe taught and headed the art department at West Texas State Normal College, watching over her youngest sibling, Claudia, at her mother&#x27;s request. In 1917, she visited her brother, Alexis, at a military camp in Texas before he shipped out for Europe during World War I. While there, she created the painting &quot;The Flag&quot;, which expressed her anxiety and depression about the war.

=== Academic training ===

From 1905 to 1906, O&#x27;Keeffe was enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied with John Vanderpoel and ranked at the top of her class. As a result of contracting typhoid fever, she had to take a year off from her education. In 1907, she attended the Art Students League in New York City, where she studied under William Merritt Chase, Kenyon Cox, and F. Luis Mora. In 1908, she won the League&#x27;s William Merritt Chase still-life prize for her oil painting &quot;Dead Rabbit with Copper Pot&quot;. Her prize was a scholarship to attend the League&#x27;s outdoor summer school in Lake George, New York. While in New York City, O&#x27;Keeffe visited galleries, such as 291, co-owned by her future husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz. The gallery promoted the work of avant-garde artists and photographers from the United States and Europe.

In 1908, O&#x27;Keeffe discovered that she would not be able to finance her studies. Her father had gone bankrupt and her mother was seriously ill with tuberculosis. She was not interested in a career as a painter based on the mimetic tradition that had formed the basis of her art training. She took a job in Chicago as a commercial artist and worked there until 1910, when she returned to Virginia to recuperate from the measles and later moved with her family to Charlottesville, Virginia. She did not paint for four years and said that the smell of turpentine made her ill. She began teaching art in 1911. One of her positions was at her former school, Chatham Episcopal Institute, in Virginia.

=== First abstractions ===
She took a summer art class in 1912 at the University of Virginia from Alon Bement, who was a Columbia University Teachers College faculty member. Under Bement, she learned of the innovative ideas of Arthur Wesley Dow, Bement&#x27;s colleague. Dow&#x27;s approach was influenced by principles of design and composition in Japanese art. She began to experiment with abstract compositions and develop a personal style that veered away from realism. From 1912 to 1914, she taught art in the public schools in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle, and was a teaching assistant to Bement during the summers. She took classes at the University of Virginia for two more summers. She also took a class in the spring of 1914 at Teachers College of Columbia University with Dow, who further influenced her thinking about the process of making art. Her studies at the University of Virginia, based upon Dow&#x27;s principles, were pivotal in O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s development as an artist. Through her exploration and growth as an artist, she helped to establish the American modernism movement.

She taught at Columbia College in Columbia, South Carolina in late 1915, where she completed a series of highly innovative charcoal abstractions based on her personal sensations. In early 1916, O&#x27;Keeffe was in New York at Teachers College, Columbia University. She mailed the charcoal drawings to a friend and former classmate at Teachers College, Anita Pollitzer, who took them to Alfred Stieglitz at his 291 gallery early in 1916. Stieglitz found them to be the &quot;purest, finest, sincerest things that had entered 291 in a long while&quot; and said that he would like to show them. In April that year, Stieglitz exhibited ten of her drawings at 291.

After further course work at Columbia in early 1916 and summer teaching for Bement, she became the chair of the art department at West Texas State Normal College, in Canyon, Texas, beginning in the fall of 1916. O&#x27;Keeffe, who enjoyed sunrises and sunsets, developed a fondness for intense and nocturnal colors. Building upon a practice she began in South Carolina, O&#x27;Keeffe painted to express her most private sensations and feelings. Rather than sketching out a design before painting, she freely created designs. O&#x27;Keeffe continued to experiment until she believed she truly captured her feelings in the watercolor, &quot;Light Coming on the Plains No. I&quot; (1917).

She began a series of watercolor paintings based upon the scenery and expansive views during her walks, including vibrant paintings of Palo Duro Canyon. She &quot;captured a monumental landscape in this simple configuration, fusing blue and green pigments in almost indistinct tonal gradations that simulate the pulsating effect of light on the horizon of the Texas Panhandle,&quot; according to author Sharyn Rohlfsen Udall.

== New York (1918–1930s) ==
=== Stieglitz circle ===
In 1918, O&#x27;Keeffe moved to New York as Stieglitz offered to provide financial support, a residence, and place for her to paint. They developed a close personal relationship, and later married, while he promoted her work. Stieglitz also discouraged her use of watercolor, which was associated with amateur women artists. According to art historian Charles Eldredge, &quot;the couple enjoyed a prominent position in the ebullient art of New York throughout the 1920s&quot;.

O&#x27;Keeffe came to know the many early American modernists who were part of Stieglitz&#x27;s circle of artists, including painters Charles Demuth, Arthur Dove, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, and photographers Paul Strand and Edward Steichen. Strand&#x27;s photography, as well as that of Stieglitz, inspired O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s work. Stieglitz, whose 291 Gallery closed down in 1917, was now able to spend more time on his own photographic practice, producing a series of photographs of natural forms, cloud studies (a series known as &quot;Equivalents&quot;), and portraits of O&#x27;Keeffe. Prior to her marriage to Stieglitz, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s drawings and paintings were frequently abstract, although she began to expand her visual vocabulary from 1924 onward to include more representational imagery &quot;usually taken from nature and often painted in series&quot;.

=== Flower paintings ===

O&#x27;Keeffe began creating simplified images of natural things, such as leaves, flowers, and rocks. Inspired by Precisionism, &quot;The Green Apple&quot;, completed in 1922, depicts her notion of simple, meaningful life. O&#x27;Keeffe said that year, &quot;it is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things.&quot; &quot;Blue and Green Music&quot; expresses O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s feelings about music through visual art, using bold and subtle colors.

Also in 1922, journalist Paul Rosenfeld commented &quot;[the] Essence of very womanhood permeates her pictures&quot;, citing her use of color and shapes as metaphors for the female body. This same article also describes her paintings in a sexual manner. O&#x27;Keeffe, most famous for her depiction of flowers, made about 200 flower paintings, which by the mid-1920s were large-scale depictions of flowers, as if seen through a magnifying lens, such as &quot;Oriental Poppies&quot; and several &quot;Red Canna&quot; paintings. She painted her first large-scale flower painting, &quot;Petunia, No. 2&quot;, in 1924 and it was first exhibited in 1925. Making magnified depictions of objects created a sense of awe and emotional intensity. In 1924, Stieglitz arranged a show displaying O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s works of art alongside his photographs at Anderson Galleries and helped to organize other exhibitions over the next several years.

=== New York Skyscraper paintings ===

After having moved into a 30th floor apartment in the Shelton Hotel in 1925, O&#x27;Keeffe began a series of paintings of the New York skyscrapers and skyline. One of her most notable works, which demonstrates her skill at depicting the buildings in the Precisionist style, is the &quot;Radiator Building–Night, New York&quot;. Other examples are &quot;New York Street with Moon&quot; (1925), &quot;The Shelton with Sunspots, N.Y.&quot; (1926), and &quot;City Night&quot; (1926). She made a cityscape, &quot;East River from the Thirtieth Story of the Shelton Hotel&quot; in 1928, a painting of her view of the East River and smoke-emitting factories in Queens. The next year she made her final New York City skyline and skyscraper paintings and traveled to New Mexico, which became a source of inspiration for her work.

The Brooklyn Museum held a retrospective of her work in 1927. In 1928, Stieglitz announced that six of her calla lily paintings sold to an anonymous buyer in France for US$25,000, but there is no evidence that this transaction occurred the way Stieglitz reported. As a result of the press attention, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s paintings sold at a higher price from that point onward.

== New Mexico (1930s–1986) ==
By 1929, she traveled to Santa Fe for the first time, accompanied by her friend Rebecca (Beck) Strand and stayed in Taos with Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided the women with studios. From her room she had a clear view of the Taos Mountains as well as the &quot;morada&quot; (meetinghouse) of the &quot;Hermanos de la Fraternidad Piadosa de Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno&quot;, also known as the Penitentes. She subsequently visited New Mexico on a near-annual basis from 1929 onward, often staying there for several months at a time, returning to New York each winter to exhibit her work at Stieglitz&#x27;s gallery. O&#x27;Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, &quot;The Lawrence Tree&quot;, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O&#x27;Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asís Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it silhouetted against the sky captured it from a unique perspective.

In New Mexico, she collected rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O&#x27;Keeffe often explored the land she loved in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained, &quot;Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the &#x27;Faraway&#x27;. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again.&quot; O&#x27;Keeffe did not work from late 1932 until about the mid-1930s due to nervous breakdowns. She was a popular artist, receiving commissions while her works were being exhibited in New York and other places.

=== Skull and desert motifs ===
In 1933 and 1934, O&#x27;Keeffe recuperated in Bermuda and returned to New Mexico in 1934. In August 1934, she moved to Ghost Ranch, north of Abiquiú. In 1940, she moved into a house on the ranch property. The varicolored cliffs surrounding the ranch inspired some of her most famous landscapes. Between 1934 and 1936, she completed a series of landscape paintings inspired by the New Mexico desert, often with prominent depictions of animal skulls, including &quot;Ram’s Head with Hollyhock&quot; (1935) and &quot;Deer&#x27;s Head with Pedernal&quot; (1936) as well as &quot;Summer Days&quot; (1936). In 1936, she completed what would become one of her best-known paintings, &quot;Summer Days&quot;. It depicts a desert scene with a deer skull with vibrant wildflowers. Resembling &quot;Ram&#x27;s Head with Hollyhock&quot;, it depicted the skull floating above the horizon.

===Hawaii series===

In 1938, the advertising agency N. W. Ayer &amp; Son approached O&#x27;Keeffe about creating two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company) to use in advertising. Other artists who produced paintings of Hawaii for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company&#x27;s advertising include Lloyd Sexton Jr., Millard Sheets, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Isamu Noguchi, and Miguel Covarrubias. The offer came at a critical time in O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s life: she was 51, and her career seemed to be stalling (critics were calling her focus on New Mexico limited, and branding her desert images &quot;a kind of mass production&quot;).

She arrived in Honolulu on February 8, 1939, aboard the SS &quot;Lurline&quot; and spent nine weeks in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the island of Hawaii. By far the most productive and vivid period was on Maui, where she was given complete freedom to explore and paint. She painted flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks. O&#x27;Keeffe completed a series of 20 sensual, verdant paintings based on her trip to Hawaii; however, she did not paint the requested pineapple until the Hawaiian Pineapple Company sent a plant to her New York studio.

=== Abiquiú and landscapes ===

In 1945, O&#x27;Keeffe bought a second house, an abandoned hacienda in Abiquiú, which she renovated into a home and studio. She moved permanently to New Mexico in 1949, spending time at both Ghost Ranch and the Abiquiú house that she made into her studio.

Todd Webb, a photographer she met in the 1940s, moved to New Mexico in 1961. He often made photographs of her, as did numerous other important American photographers, who consistently presented O&#x27;Keeffe as a &quot;loner, a severe figure and self-made person.&quot; While O&#x27;Keeffe was known to have a &quot;prickly personality,&quot; Webb&#x27;s photographs portray her with a kind of &quot;quietness and calm&quot; suggesting a relaxed friendship, and revealing new contours of O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s character.

In the 1940s, O&#x27;Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the &quot;Black Place&quot;, about west of her Ghost Ranch house. O&#x27;Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled &quot;a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet.&quot; She made paintings of the &quot;White Place&quot;, a white rock formation located near her Abiquiú house. In 1946, she began making the architectural forms of her Abiquiú house—the patio wall and door—subjects in her work. It was in this period that O&#x27;Keefe also worked seriously with photography, providing striking counterparts to her patio and door paintings. Another distinctive painting was &quot;Ladder to the Moon&quot;, 1958. In the mid-1960s, O&#x27;Keeffe produced &quot;Sky Above Clouds&quot;, a series of cloudscapes inspired by her views from airplane windows. Worcester Art Museum held a retrospective of her work in 1960 and 10 years later, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Retrospective Exhibition&quot;.

Beginning in 1946, O&#x27;Keeffe worked with the painting conservator Caroline Keck to preserve the visual impression of her paintings. O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s stated preference was for her works to be free of dirt, even if removing such soiling caused abrasion to her colors. Keck encouraged O&#x27;Keeffe to begin applying acrylic varnishes to her works in order to facilitate their cleaning.

During the 1940s, O&#x27;Keeffe had two one-woman retrospectives, the first at the Art Institute of Chicago (1943). Her second was in 1946, when she was the first woman artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan. The Whitney Museum began an effort to create the first catalogue of her work in the mid-1940s.

===Late career and death===
By 1972, O&#x27;Keeffe had lost much of her eyesight due to macular degeneration, leaving her with only peripheral vision. She stopped oil painting without assistance in 1972. In 1973, O&#x27;Keeffe hired John Bruce &quot;Juan&quot; Hamilton as a live-in assistant and then a caretaker. Hamilton was a potter. Hamilton taught O&#x27;Keeffe to work with clay, encouraged her to resume painting despite her deteriorating eyesight, and helped her write her autobiography. He worked for her for 13 years. The artist&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe&quot;, published in 1976 by Viking Press, featured &quot;Summer Days&quot; (1936) on the cover. It became a bestseller. During the 1970s, she made a series of works in watercolor. She continued working in pencil and charcoal until 1984.

O&#x27;Keeffe became increasingly frail in her late nineties. She moved to Santa Fe in 1984, where she died on March 6, 1986, at the age of 98. Her body was cremated and her ashes were scattered, as she wished, on the land around Ghost Ranch. Following O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s death, her family contested her will because codicils added to it in the 1980s had left most of her $65million estate to Hamilton. The case was ultimately settled out of court in July 1987. The case became a famous precedent in estate planning.

== Reception ==
=== Awards and honors ===

In 1938, O&#x27;Keeffe received an honorary degree of &quot;Doctor of Fine Arts&quot; from the College of William &amp; Mary. Later, O&#x27;Keeffe was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and in 1966 was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among her awards and honors, O&#x27;Keeffe received the M. Carey Thomas Award at Bryn Mawr College in 1971 and two years later received an honorary degree from Harvard University.

In 1977, President Gerald Ford presented O&#x27;Keeffe with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor awarded to American civilians. In 1985, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Ronald Reagan. In 1993, she was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

=== Art criticism and scholarship ===
O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s lotus paintings may have deeper ties to vulvar imagery and symbolism. In Egyptian mythology, lotus flowers are a symbol of the womb, and in Indian mythology, they are direct symbols for vulvas. Feminist art historian Linda Nochlin, the author of the influential 1971 essay titled &quot;Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?&quot;, also interpreted &quot;Black Iris III&quot; (1926) as a morphological metaphor for a vulva.

Art dealer Samuel Kootz was one of O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s critics who, although considering her to be &quot;the only prominent woman artist&quot; (in the words of Marilyn Hall Mitchell), considered sexual expression in her work (and other artists&#x27; work) artistically problematic. Kootz stated that &quot;assertion of sex can only impede the talents of an artist, for it is an act of defiance, of grievance, in which the consciousness of these qualities retards the natural assertions of the painter&quot;.

O&#x27;Keeffe stood her ground against sexual interpretations of her work, and for fifty years maintained that there was no connection between vulvas and her artwork. Firing back against some of the criticism, O&#x27;Keeffe stated, &quot;When people read erotic symbols into my paintings, they&#x27;re really talking about their own affairs.&quot; She attributed other artists&#x27; attacks on her work to psychological projection. O&#x27;Keeffe was also seen as a revolutionary feminist; however, the artist rejected these notions, stating that &quot;femaleness is irrelevant&quot; and that &quot;it has nothing to do with art making or accomplishment.&quot;

==Personal life==
In June 1918, O&#x27;Keeffe accepted Stieglitz&#x27;s invitation to move to New York from Texas after he promised to provide her a quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took the first of many nude photographs of her at his family&#x27;s apartment while his wife was away. His wife returned home while their session was still in progress and gave him an ultimatum. Stieglitz left immediately and moved into an apartment in the city with O&#x27;Keeffe. In mid-August when they visited Oaklawn, the Stieglitz family summer estate in Lake George in upstate New York, they behaved like two teenagers in love. Also around this time, O&#x27;Keeffe became sick during the 1918 flu pandemic.

In February 1921, Stieglitz&#x27;s photographs of O&#x27;Keeffe were included in a retrospective exhibition at the Anderson Galleries. Stieglitz started photographing O&#x27;Keeffe when she visited him in New York City to see her 1917 exhibition, and continued taking photographs, many of which were in the nude. It created a public sensation. When he retired from photography in 1937, he had made more than 350 portraits and more than 200 nude photos of her. In 1978, she wrote about how distant from them she had become, &quot;When I look over the photographs Stieglitz took of me—some of them more than sixty years ago—I wonder who that person is. It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives.&quot;

Owing to the legal delays caused by Stieglitz&#x27;s first wife and her family, it would take six years before he obtained a divorce. O&#x27;Keeffe and Stieglitz were married on December 11, 1924. For the rest of their lives together, their relationship was, &quot;a collusion...a system of deals and trade-offs, tacitly agreed to and carried out, for the most part, without the exchange of a word. Preferring avoidance to confrontation on most issues, O&#x27;Keeffe was the principal agent of collusion in their union,&quot; according to biographer Benita Eisler. They lived primarily in New York City, but spent their summers at his father&#x27;s family estate, Oaklawn, in Lake George in upstate New York.
O&#x27;Keeffe and Stieglitz had an open relationship, which could be painful for O&#x27;Keeffe when Stieglitz had affairs with women. In 1928, Stieglitz began a long-term affair with Dorothy Norman, who was also married, and O&#x27;Keeffe lost a project to create a mural for Radio City Music Hall. She was hospitalized for depression. At the suggestion of Maria Chabot and Mabel Dodge Luhan, O&#x27;Keeffe began to spend the summers painting in New Mexico in 1929. She traveled by train with her friend the painter Rebecca Strand, Paul Strand&#x27;s wife, to Taos, where they lived with their patron who provided them with studios. In 1933, O&#x27;Keeffe was hospitalized for two months after suffering a nervous breakdown, largely due to Stieglitz&#x27;s affair with Dorothy Norman. She did not paint again until January 1934.

O&#x27;Keeffe continued to visit New Mexico, without her husband, and created a new body of works based upon the desert. O&#x27;Keeffe broke free of &quot;strict gender roles&quot; and adopted &quot;gender neutral&quot; clothing, as did other professional women in Santa Fe and Taos who experienced &quot;psychological space and sexual freedom&quot; there.

Shortly after O&#x27;Keeffe arrived for the summer in New Mexico in 1946, Stieglitz suffered a cerebral thrombosis (stroke). She immediately flew to New York to be with him. He died on July 13, 1946. She buried his ashes at Lake George. She spent the next three years mostly in New York settling his estate.

She had a close relationship with Beck Strand. They enjoyed spending time together, traveling, and living with &quot;glee&quot;. Strand said that she was most herself when with O&#x27;Keeffe. In &quot;Foursome&quot;—a book about O&#x27;Keeffe, Stieglitz, and Beck and Paul Strand—Carolyn Burke argues against the notion that the women were sexually or romantically involved, finding such a reading of their correspondence incongruous with their &quot;passionate ties to their husbands&quot; and &quot;strong heterosexual attractions&quot;.

Frida Kahlo met O&#x27;Keeffe in December 1931 in New York City at the opening of Diego Rivera&#x27;s solo exhibition at the MOMA, after which a friendship developed. They remained friends, staying in touch when O&#x27;Keeffe recuperated from a nervous breakdown in a hospital and then in Bermuda. Both women visited each other&#x27;s homes on a couple of occasions in the 1950s.

Among guests to visit her at the ranch over the years were Charles and Anne Lindbergh, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, poet Allen Ginsberg, and photographer Ansel Adams. She traveled and camped at &quot;Black Place&quot; often with her friend, Maria Chabot, and later with Eliot Porter.

== Legacy ==
Marquette Middle School in Madison, Wisconsin was renamed as Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Middle School.

In 2020, Tymberwood Academy (in Gravesend, Kent, England), pupils chose new class names. One of the winning names for a Year 3 class was Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe.

=== Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum ===


O&#x27;Keeffe was a legend beginning in the 1920s, known as much for her independent spirit and female role model as for her dramatic and innovative works of art. Nancy and Jules Heller said, &quot;The most remarkable thing about O&#x27;Keeffe was the audacity and uniqueness of her early work.&quot; At that time, even in Europe, there were few artists exploring abstraction. Even though her works may show elements of different modernist movements, such as Surrealism and Precisionism, her work is uniquely her own style.

A substantial part of her estate&#x27;s assets were transferred to the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Foundation, a nonprofit. The Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum opened in Santa Fe in 1997. The assets included a large body of her work, photographs, archival materials, and her Abiquiú house, library, and property. The Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiú was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998, and is now owned by the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum. A fossilized species of archosaur was named &quot;Effigia okeeffeae&quot; (&quot;O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Ghost&quot;) in January 2006, &quot;in honor of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe for her numerous paintings of the badlands at Ghost Ranch and her interest in the &quot;Coelophysis&quot; Quarry when it was discovered&quot;. In November 2016, the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum recognized the importance of her time in Charlottesville by dedicating an exhibition, using watercolors that she had created over three summers. It was entitled, O&#x27;Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912–1914.

=== Popular culture ===
In 1991, PBS aired the &quot;American Playhouse&quot; production &quot;A Marriage: Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz&quot;, starring Jane Alexander as O&#x27;Keeffe and Christopher Plummer as Alfred Stieglitz. In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent stamp honoring O&#x27;Keeffe. In 2013, on the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show, the USPS issued a stamp featuring O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico/Out Back of Marie&#x27;s II, 1930&quot; as part of their Modern Art in America series. Lifetime Television produced a biopic of Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe starring Joan Allen as O&#x27;Keeffe, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Stieglitz, Henry Simmons as Jean Toomer, Ed Begley Jr. as Stieglitz&#x27;s brother Lee, and Tyne Daly as Mabel Dodge Luhan. It premiered on September 19, 2009.

On November 20, 2014, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s &quot;Jimson Weed/White Flower No 1&quot; (1932) sold for $44,405,000 in 2014 at auction to Walmart heiress Alice Walton, more than three times the previous world auction record for any female artist.

=== Women&#x27;s suffrage and feminism ===
In &quot;Equal Under the Sky: Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and Twentieth Century Feminism&quot;, Linda M. Grasso documents O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s life-long involvement in feminism and women&#x27;s issues. O&#x27;Keeffe came of age as a woman and an artist in the 1910s, at the height of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement and the intense artistic ferment of modernism. Grasso notes that &quot;Modernists championed rupture, innovation, and daring in art forms, styles, and perspectives,&quot; and that O&#x27;Keeffe &quot;first created herself as an artist when feminism and modernism were interlinked&quot;. As early as 1915, O&#x27;Keeffe was reading books and articles on women&#x27;s suffrage and cultural politics with enthusiasm, such as Floyd Dell&#x27;s &quot;Women as World Builders: Studies in Modern Feminism&quot;. There was much talk in this era about the &quot;New Woman,&quot; liberated from Victorian strictures and mores and pursuing her own life and education and self-expression freely. O&#x27;Keeffe was in active dialogue with her suffragist friend Anita Pollitzer, with whom she exchanged letters on the subject. Pollitzer, in fact, was the first person to introduce Alfred Stieglitz to O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s art work. She was also reading Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Olive Schreiner, among others, alongside the radical magazine &quot;The Masses&quot;, and lecturing on modernist dancer Isadora Duncan. In a debate with Michael Gold in 1930, O&#x27;Keeffe said she was &quot;interested in the oppression of women of all classes&quot;. Gross writes: &quot;She sustained an affiliation with the National Woman&#x27;s Party and made public statements about gender discrimination and women&#x27;s rights in interviews, speeches, letters, and articles into the 1970s.&quot;

She received unprecedented acceptance as a woman artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images and within a decade of moving to New York City, she was the highest-paid American woman artist. She was known for a distinctive style in all aspects of her life.

Mary Beth Edelson&#x27;s &quot;Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper&quot; (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot;, with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. John the Apostle&#x27;s head was replaced with Nancy Graves, and Christ&#x27;s with Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.&quot; Judy Chicago gave O&#x27;Keeffe a prominent place in her &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; (1979) in recognition of what many prominent feminist artists considered groundbreaking introduction of sensual and feminist imagery in her works of art. Although feminists celebrated O&#x27;Keeffe as the originator of &quot;female iconography&quot;, she did not consider herself a feminist. She disliked being called a &quot;woman artist&quot; and wanted to be considered an &quot;artist.&quot;

<doc id="311616" wikidata="Q826867" url="?curid=311616" title="Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe">
<text>The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe is a federally recognized Native American tribe in Pacific County, Washington, United States. The tribe is descended from the Lower Chehalis and the Willapa (Shoalwater) Chinook peoples. In 2016, the tribe had 373 enrolled citizens.

The Shoalwater Bay Tribe governs the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation. Its tribal headquarters is in Tokeland, Washington.

== History ==
The Shoalwater Bay Tribe is descended from the Shoalwater Bay Indians, a term used to refer to the multiple peoples whose homelands are in Willapa Bay (formerly known as Shoalwater Bay), including the Lower Chehalis and the Willapa Chinook, as well as others.

In 1855, the Shoalwater Bay Indians attended the signing of the Chehalis River Treaty. Leaders of the tribes living in Willapa Bay refused to sign the treaty, returning to their lands to continue their traditional lifestyles. Eleven years later, on September 22, 1866, Andrew Johnson issued an executive order that created a reservation at , the location of a former Lower Chehalis village. By this time, thirty to forty Indian families remained at Willapa Bay. The order set aside a tract of land for &quot;miscellaneous Indian purposes,&quot; essentially allowing the Shoalwater Bay peoples to retain a land base without having signed any treaty.

From 1899 to 1936, the chief of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe was George A. Charley, one of the last people in the region to have a flattened head (as was the custom for noble families in the Pacific Northwest). His father, Charley Toke, was appointed chief before him.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe remained unrecognized by the federal government. In the 1960s, negotiations began between the Shoalwater Bay Indians and the United States. Eventually, on March 10, 1971, the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe was recognized by the US government, maintaining their sovereignty. The Shoalwater Bay Tribe adopted their constitution shortly after, on May 22.

In 1984, the tribe relinquished its claim to of land given by the US government to an American citizen in 1872. The tribe was given $1,000,000 for the claim.

Between 1988 and 1998, the tribe went through a health crisis in which an alarming number of pregnancies, between 25 and 66 percent, were resulting in stillbirths, miscarriages, and infant deaths. No cause was ever officially identified, although it was associated with a lack of prenatal care. The crisis resulted in increased awareness and federal funding for tribal members&#x27; health care.

In February 2006, the American Museum of Natural History in New York was issued a NAGPRA notice, as they held the remains of eight people who were likely of Shoalwater origin.

== Government ==
The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe is governed by the General Council, which consists of all enrolled members 18 years of age or older. The Tribal Council is a five-member elected body which is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the tribe. Additionally, the Tribal Council employs a Tribal Administrator who oversees administrative duties as well as managing the 29 departments of the government.

As of September 2024, the members of the Tribal Council are as follows:

* Chairman: Quinton Swanson
* Vice chairman: Shane Thomas
* Secretary: Lynn Clark
* Treasurer: Joel Blake
* Dennis Julnes

== Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation ==
The Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation is the reservation of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe, located west of Tokeland on the southwest coast of Washington in northwestern Pacific County, along the northern shores of Willapa Bay. The reservation is 2.693 km2 (1.0397 sq mi) large. It had 70 residents in 2000. In 2020, 82 people lived on the reservation.

The reservation was established in 1866.

In 2010, there were &quot;about half a dozen&quot; Indigenous families living on the reservation. As of 2020, the reservation has 32 households living in 41 housing units. Sixty percent of the reservation population is employed, and 80.4 percent have health care coverage. Only 3.6 percent have earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

== Economy and services ==
The tribe operates the Shoalwater Bay Casino, which opened in 1998. The tribe also operates a police force, library, wellness center, oyster company, and a recreation center.

Many tribal members work in nearby cranberry bogs and in the fishing and crabbing industries. Children attend school in the nearby community of Ocosta. In the 1990s, the tribe ranked as one of the poorest in the state, with ninety percent of tribal members living below the poverty line.

The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe is part of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board. They provide medical care for American Indian and Alaska Native people, as well as local non-Native people. Their tribal clinic serves 890 people.

== Demographics ==
The Shoalwater Bay Tribe is one of the smallest tribes in Washington state. In 2016, there were 373 citizens of the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe. In 2005, there were 207 members. In 1992, there were 134 members. In 1985, there were 64 enrolled members. About &quot;half a dozen&quot; of the enrolled members lived on the reservation around 2010.

== Culture ==
The ancestral tribes of Willapa Bay relied heavily on canoes for transport, and were regarded as expert canoers. Canoes stopped being produced by members of the tribe in the late 19th century. On August 23, 2008, the Shoalwater Bay tribe built canoes for the first time since the 1800s, participating in the Tribal Canoe Journeys with the Chinook Indian Nation and Confederated Tribes of the Grande Ronde from Toke Point to Bay Center.

=== Language ===
Historically, the peoples of Willapa Bay spoke Lower Chinook, Lower Chehalis, and likely Kwalhioqua-Clatskanie, an Athabaskan language. By 1879, the peoples of Shoalwater Bay spoke Lower Chehalis, a Salishan (Coast/Tsamosan) language.

The original Scandinavian currencies were based on the silver Reichsthaler, defined by the Hamburger Bank as 25.28 grams fine silver, which was equal to one Norwegian speciedaler or two Danish rigsdaler. Sweden&#x27;s &quot;riksdaler specie&quot; was slightly heavier at 25.5 g and was equal to four Swedish riksdaler &quot;riksgalds&quot;.

The Scandinavian switch to the gold standard was triggered by Germany&#x27;s adoption of the German gold mark in 1873 and of the consequent disturbance in the silver market. The monetary union established the gold krone (&quot;krona&quot; in Swedish) replacing the legacy currencies at the rate of 1 krone = 1 Swedish riksdaler = Danish rigsdaler = Norwegian speciedaler = Hamburg reichsthaler. The latter&#x27;s conversion to 4.50 German gold marks (hence, 1 krone = 1.125 marks) established the gold parity of the krone: one gram of fine gold worth 2.79 marks was equivalent to 2.48 krone (or 0.4032 g gold per krone).

The British pound (the &quot;world currency&quot; of the time) was equal to 18.16 kroner, and the franc of France and the Latin Monetary Union was worth 0.72 krone. Sweden&#x27;s long-established tradition of using paper currency eased the implementation of a Gold Exchange Standard wherein gold coins rarely circulated but the respective central banks (the Sveriges Riksbank, Danmarks Nationalbank and Norges Bank) centralized their respective gold reserves and guaranteed the conversion of krone banknotes to gold for export purposes.

The union provided fixed exchange rates and stability in monetary terms, but the member countries continued to issue their own separate currencies. Although not initially foreseen, the perceived security led to a situation where the formally separate currencies were accepted on a basis of &quot;as good as&quot; the legal tender virtually throughout the entire area.

Upon acceding to the union, Sweden had the name of its currency changed from Riksdaler Riksmynt to Swedish krona. The word &quot;krone/krona&quot; literally means &quot;crown&quot;, and the differences in spelling of the name represent the differences between the North Germanic languages.

The political union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved in 1905, but this did not affect the basis for co-operation in the monetary union.

All three countries still use the same currencies as during the monetary union, but they lost their peg, one to one, in 1914. The Icelandic króna is a derivative of the Danish krone, established after Iceland was elevated to a separate kingdom in union with Denmark in 1918. Iceland cut its ties to Denmark in 1944 and became a republic. The Icelandic króna soon became volatile, causing a high inflation and in 1980 a currency reform was introduced, in which 1 new Icelandic króna was set to 100 original ones.

The Scandinavian Monetary Union was inspired by the Latin Monetary Union, established in 1865. As Scandinavia became industrialized, a call for a firm monetary system had risen in the 1860s. The idea of using a foreign currency was discussed, but as the old dividing of the British Pound was similar to what Scandinavia wished to get rid of, the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War made the French Franc less attractive and as the German Mark was out of the question in Denmark after the 1864 Second Schleswig War, the idea of a Scandinavian Monetary system based on the Gold standard was imposed 1873 to 1875. The union was dissolved gradually from the outbreak of World War One until 1924, when the union formally was dissolved. Nevertheless, the 1:1:1 banknote rate continued at least until the economical crisis in the early 1930s.

Whether the Scandinavian Monetary Union was a success has been a subject of discussion. Some experts observe it functioned best between 1901 and 1905, at which point it was a complete system of coin, banknotes and common drawing rights available to the central banks. Although it was effective in its own limited monetary terms, the Union, however, was only of minor importance in the total foreign relations of the member countries. Moreover, the trade between the member countries composed only a small part of their total trade, a share that was in decline during the lifetime of the Union. The monetary union was never accompanied by a tariff union as well. This stresses its partial nature - it never formed a vital part of these countries&#x27; international economic relations. Other experts take a more positive view, arguing that no other politically independent countries went equally far in their monetary integration. From an international perspective, it was the most successful of all monetary unions during the time of the classic gold standard.

<text>A game programmer is a software engineer, programmer, or computer scientist who primarily develops codebases for video games or related software, such as game development tools. Game programming has many specialized disciplines, all of which fall under the umbrella term of &quot;game programmer&quot;. A game programmer should not be confused with a game designer, who works on game design.

== History ==

In the early days of video games (from the early 1970s to mid-1980s), a game programmer also took on the job of a designer and artist. This was generally because the abilities of early computers were so limited that having specialized personnel for each function was unnecessary. Game concepts were generally light and games were only meant to be played for a few minutes at a time, but more importantly, art content and variations in gameplay were constrained by computers&#x27; limited power.

Later, as specialized arcade hardware and home systems became more powerful, game developers could develop deeper storylines and could include such features as high-resolution and full color graphics, physics, advanced artificial intelligence and digital sound. Technology has advanced to such a great degree that contemporary games usually boast 3D graphics and full motion video using assets developed by professional graphic artists. Nowadays, the derogatory term &quot;programmer art&quot; has come to imply the kind of bright colors and blocky design that were typical of early video games.

The desire for adding more depth and assets to games necessitated a division of labor. Initially, art production was relegated to full-time artists. Next game programming became a separate discipline from game design. Now, only some games, such as the puzzle game &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, are simple enough to require just one full-time programmer. Despite this division, however, most game developers (artists, programmers and even producers) have some say in the final design of contemporary games.

== Disciplines ==

A contemporary video game may include advanced physics, artificial intelligence, 3D graphics, digitised sound, an original musical score, complex strategy and may use several input devices (such as mice, keyboards, gamepads and joysticks) and may be playable against other people via the Internet or over a LAN. Each aspect of the game can consume all of one programmer&#x27;s time and, in many cases, several programmers. Some programmers may specialize in one area of game programming, but many are familiar with several aspects. The number of programmers needed for each feature depends somewhat on programmers&#x27; skills, but mostly are dictated by the type of game being developed.

=== Game engine programmer ===

Game engine programmers create the base engine of the game, including the simulated physics and graphics disciplines. Increasingly, video games use existing game engines, either commercial, open source or free. They are often customized for a particular game, and these programmers handle these modifications.

==== Physics engine programmer ====

A game&#x27;s physics programmer is dedicated to developing the physics a game will employ. Typically, a game will only simulate a few aspects of real-world physics. For example, a space game may need simulated gravity, but would not have any need for simulating water viscosity.

Since processing cycles are always at a premium, physics programmers may employ &quot;shortcuts&quot; that are computationally inexpensive, but look and act &quot;good enough&quot; for the game in question. In other cases, unrealistic physics are employed to allow easier gameplay or for dramatic effect. Sometimes, a specific subset of situations is specified and the physical outcome of such situations are stored in a record of some sort and are never computed at runtime at all.

Some physics programmers may even delve into the difficult tasks of inverse kinematics and other motions attributed to game characters, but increasingly these motions are assigned via motion capture libraries so as not to overload the CPU with complex calculations.

==== Graphics engine programmer ====

Historically, this title usually belonged to a programmer who developed specialized blitter algorithms and clever optimizations for 2D graphics. Today, however, it is almost exclusively applied to programmers who specialize in developing and modifying complex 3D graphic renderers. Some 2D graphics skills have just recently become useful again, though, for developing games for the new generation of cell phones and handheld game consoles.

A 3D graphics programmer must have a firm grasp of advanced mathematical concepts such as vector and matrix math, quaternions and linear algebra.

Skilled programmers specializing in this area of game development can demand high wages and are usually a scarce commodity. Their skills can be used for video games on any platform.

=== Artificial intelligence programmer ===

An AI programmer develops the logic of time to simulate intelligence in enemies and opponents. It has recently evolved into a specialized discipline, as these tasks used to be implemented by programmers who specialized in other areas. An AI programmer may program pathfinding, strategy and enemy tactic systems. This is one of the most challenging aspects of game programming and its sophistication is developing rapidly. Contemporary games dedicate approximately 10 to 20 percent of their programming staff to AI.

Some games, such as strategy games like &quot;Civilization III&quot; or role-playing video games such as &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, use AI heavily, while others, such as puzzle games, use it sparingly or not at all. Many game developers have created entire languages that can be used to program their own AI for games via scripts. These languages are typically less technical than the language used to implement the game, and will often be used by the game or level designers to implement the world of the game. Many studios also make their games&#x27; scripting available to players, and it is often used extensively by third party mod developers.

The AI technology used in games programming should not be confused with academic AI programming and research. Although both areas do borrow from each other, they are usually considered distinct disciplines, though there are exceptions. For example, the 2001 game by Lionhead Studios &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; features a unique AI approach to a user controlled creature who uses learning to model behaviors during game-play. In recent years, more effort has been directed towards intervening promising fields of AI research and game AI programming.

=== Sound programmer ===

Not always a separate discipline, sound programming has been a mainstay of game programming since the days of &quot;Pong&quot;. Most games make use of audio, and many have a full musical score. Computer audio games eschew graphics altogether and use sound as their primary feedback mechanism.

Many games use advanced techniques such as 3D positional sound, making audio programming a non-trivial matter. With these games, one or two programmers may dedicate all their time to building and refining the game&#x27;s sound engine, and sound programmers may be trained or have a formal background in digital signal processing.

Scripting tools are often created or maintained by sound programmers for use by sound designers. These tools allow designers to associate sounds with characters, actions, objects and events while also assigning music or atmospheric sounds for game environments (levels or areas) and setting environmental variables such as reverberation.

=== Gameplay programmer ===

Though all programmers add to the content and experience that a game provides, a gameplay programmer focuses more on a game&#x27;s strategy, implementation of the game&#x27;s mechanics and logic, and the &quot;feel&quot; of a game. This is usually not a separate discipline, as what this programmer does usually differs from game to game, and they will inevitably be involved with more specialized areas of the game&#x27;s development such as graphics or sound.

This programmer may implement strategy tables, tweak input code, or adjust other factors that alter the game. Many of these aspects may be altered by programmers who specialize in these areas, however (for example, strategy tables may be implemented by AI programmers).

=== Scripter ===

In early video games, gameplay programmers would write code to create all the content in the game—if the player was supposed to shoot a particular enemy, and a red key was supposed to appear along with some text on the screen, then this functionality was all written as part of the core program in C or assembly language by a gameplay programmer.

More often today the core game engine is usually separated from gameplay programming. This has several development advantages. The game engine deals with graphics rendering, sound, physics and so on while a scripting language deals with things like cinematic events, enemy behavior and game objectives. Large game projects can have a team of scripters to implement these sorts of game content.

Scripters usually are also game designers. It is often easier to find a qualified game designer who can be taught a script language as opposed to finding a qualified game designer who has mastered C++.

=== UI programmer ===

This programmer specializes in programming user interfaces (UIs) for games. Though some games have custom user interfaces, this programmer is more likely to develop a library that can be used across multiple projects. Most UIs look 2D, though contemporary UIs usually use the same 3D technology as the rest of the game so some knowledge of 3D math and systems is helpful for this role. Advanced UI systems may allow scripting and special effects, such as transparency, animation or particle effects for the controls.

=== Input programmer ===

Input programming, while usually not a job title, or even a full-time position on a particular game project, is still an important task. This programmer writes the code specifying how input devices such as a keyboard, mouse or joystick affect the game. These routines are typically developed early in production and are continually tweaked during development. Normally, one programmer does not need to dedicate his entire time to developing these systems. A real-time motion-controlled game utilizing devices such as the Wii Remote or Kinect may need a very complex and low latency input system, while the HID requirements of a mouse-driven turn-based strategy game such as &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; are significantly simpler to implement.

=== Network programmer ===

This programmer writes code that allows players to compete or cooperate, connected via a LAN or the Internet (or in rarer cases, directly connected via modem). Programmers implementing these game features can spend all their time in this one role, which is often considered one of the most technically challenging. Network latency, packet compression, and dropped or interrupted connections are just a few of the concerns one must consider. Although multi-player features can consume the entire production timeline and require the other engine systems to be designed with networking in mind, network systems are often put off until the last few months of development, adding additional difficulties to this role. Some titles have had their online features (often considered lower priority than the core gameplay) cut months away from release due to concerns such as lack of management, design forethought, or scalability. &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot; for the PS3 is a notable example of this trend.

=== Game tools programmer ===

The tools programmer can assist the development of a game by writing custom tools for it. Game development Tools often contain features such as script compilation, importing or converting art assets, and level editing. While some tools used may be COTS products such as an IDE or a graphics editor, tools programmers create tools with specific functions tailored to a specific game which are not available in commercial products. For example, an adventure game developer might need an editor for branching story dialogs, and a sport game developer could use a proprietary editor to manage players and team stats. These tools are usually not available to the consumers who buy the game.

=== Porting programmer ===

Porting a game from one platform to another has always been an important activity for game developers. Some programmers specialize in this activity, converting code from one operating system to work on another. Sometimes, the programmer is responsible for making the application work not for just one operating system, but on a variety of devices, such as mobile phones. Often, however, &quot;porting&quot; can involve re-writing the entire game from scratch as proprietary languages, tools or hardware make converting source code a fruitless endeavour.

This programmer must be familiar with both the original and target operating systems and languages (for example, converting a game originally written in C++ to Java), convert assets, such as artwork and sounds or rewrite code for low memory phones. This programmer may also have to side-step buggy language implementations, some with little documentation, refactor code, oversee multiple branches of code, rewrite code to scale for wide variety of screen sizes and implement special operator guidelines. They may also have to fix bugs that were not discovered in the original release of a game.

=== Technology programmer ===

The technology programmer is more likely to be found in larger development studios with specific departments dedicated solely to R&amp;D. Unlike other members of the programming team, the technology programmer usually isn&#x27;t tied to a specific project or type of development for an extended length of time, and they will typically report directly to a CTO or department head rather than a game producer. As the job title implies, this position is extremely demanding from a technical perspective and requires intimate knowledge of the target platform hardware. Tasks cover a broad range of subjects including the practical implementation of algorithms described in research papers, very low-level assembly optimization and the ability to solve challenging issues pertaining to memory requirements and caching issues during the latter stages of a project. There is considerable amount of cross-over between this position and some of the others, particularly the graphics programmer.

=== Generalist ===

In smaller teams, one or more programmers will often be described as &#x27;Generalists&#x27; who will take on the various other roles as needed. Generalists are often engaged in the task of tracking down bugs and determining which subsystem expertise is required to fix them.

=== Lead game programmer ===

The lead programmer is ultimately in charge of all programming for the game. It is their job to make sure the various submodules of the game are being implemented properly and to keep track of development from a programming standpoint. A person in this role usually transitions from other aspects of game programming to this role after several years of experience. Despite the title, this person usually has less time for writing code than other programmers on the project as they are required to attend meetings and interface with the client or other leads on the game. However, the lead programmer is still expected to program at least some of the time and is also expected to be knowledgeable in most technical areas of the game. There is often considerable common ground in the role of technical director and lead programmer, such that the jobs are often covered by one person.

== Platforms ==

Game programmers can specialize on one platform or another, such as the Wii U or Windows. So, in addition to specializing in one game programming discipline, a programmer may also specialize in development on a certain platform. Therefore, one game programmer&#x27;s title might be &quot;PlayStation 3 3D Graphics Programmer.&quot; Some disciplines, such as AI, are transferable to various platforms and needn&#x27;t be tailored to one system or another. Also, general game development principles such as 3D graphics programming concepts, sound engineering and user interface design are transferable between platforms.

== Education ==

Notably, there are many game programmers with no formal education in the subject, having started out as hobbyists and doing a great deal of programming on their own, for fun, and eventually succeeding because of their aptitude and homegrown experience. However, most job solicitations for game programmers specify a bachelor&#x27;s degree (in mathematics, physics, computer science, &quot;or equivalent experience&quot;).

Increasingly, universities are starting to offer courses and degrees in game programming. Any such degrees have considerable overlap with computer science and software engineering degrees.

== Salary ==

Salaries for game programmers vary from company to company and country to country. In general, however, pay for game programming is generally about the same for comparable jobs in the business sector. This is despite the fact that game programming is some of the most difficult of any type and usually requires longer hours than mainstream programming.

Results of a 2010 survey in the United States indicate that the average salary for a game programmer is USD$95,300 annually. The least experienced programmers, with less than 3 years of experience, make an average annual salary of over $72,000. The most experienced programmers, with more than 6 years of experience, make an average annual salary of over $124,000.

Generally, lead programmers are the most well compensated, though some 3D graphics programmers may challenge or surpass their salaries. According to the same survey above, lead programmers on average earn $127,900 annually.

== Job security ==

Though sales of video games rival other forms of entertainment such as movies, the video game industry is extremely volatile. Game programmers are not insulated from this instability as their employers experience financial difficulty.

Third-party developers, the most common type of video game developers, depend upon a steady influx of funds from the video game publisher. If a milestone or deadline is not met (or for a host of other reasons, like the game is cancelled), funds may become short and the developer may be forced to retrench employees or declare bankruptcy and go out of business. Game programmers who work for large publishers are somewhat insulated from these circumstances, but even the large game publishers can go out of business (as when Hasbro Interactive was sold to Infogrames and several projects were cancelled; or when The 3DO Company went bankrupt in 2003 and ceased all operations). Some game programmers&#x27; resumes consist of short stints lasting no more than a year as they are forced to leap from one doomed studio to another. This is why some prefer to consult and are therefore somewhat shielded from the effects of the fates of individual studios.

== Languages and tools ==
Most commercial computer and video games are written primarily in C++, C, and some assembly language. Many games, especially those with complex interactive gameplay mechanics, tax hardware to its limit. As such, highly optimized code is required for these games to run at an acceptable frame rate. Because of this, compiled code is typically used for performance-critical components, such as visual rendering and physics calculations. Almost all PC games also use either the DirectX, OpenGL APIs or some wrapper library to interface with hardware devices.

Various script languages, like Ruby, Lua and Python, are also used for the generation of content such as gameplay and especially AI. Scripts are generally parsed at load time (when the game or level is loaded into main memory) and then executed at runtime (via logic branches or other such mechanisms). They are generally not executed by an interpreter, which would result in much slower execution. Scripts tend to be used selectively, often for AI and high-level game logic. Some games are designed with high dependency on scripts and some scripts are compiled to binary format before game execution. In the optimization phase of development, some script functions will often be rewritten in a compiled language.

Java is used for many web browser based games because it is cross-platform, does not usually require installation by the user, and poses fewer security risks, compared to a downloaded executable program. Java is also a popular language for mobile phone based games. Adobe Flash, which uses the ActionScript language, and JavaScript are popular development tools for browser-based games.

As games have grown in size and complexity, middleware is becoming increasingly popular within the industry. Middleware provides greater and higher level functionality and larger feature sets than the standard lower level APIs such as DirectX and OpenGL, such as skeletal animation. In addition to providing more complex technologies, some middleware also makes reasonable attempts to be platform independent, making common conversions from, for example, Microsoft Windows to PS4 much easier. Essentially, middleware is aimed at cutting out as much of the redundancy in the development cycle as possible (for example, writing new animation systems for each game a studio produces), allowing programmers to focus on new content.

Other tools are also essential to game developers: 2D and 3D packages (for example Blender, GIMP, Photoshop, Maya or 3D Studio Max) enable programmers to view and modify assets generated by artists or other production personnel. Source control systems keep source code safe, secure and optimize merging. IDEs with debuggers (such as Visual Studio) make writing code and tracking down bugs a less painful experience.

<text>The Squaxin Island Tribe is a federally recognized tribe located in Mason County, Washington. They are descended from several Southern Coast Salish peoples, including the Squaxin, Sahewamish, T&#x27;Peeksin, Squiaitl, Stechass, and Nusechatl.

Historically, the ancestors of the Squaxin Island Tribe inhabited several inlets of the South Puget Sound. The Reservation was created in 1854 by the Treaty of Medicine Creek, comprising the entirety of Squaxin Island. Today, the reservation also includes several small parcels in the nearby area. Tribal members no longer reside on Squaxin Island itself, but 509 residents live on other Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land. Total tribal membership was at 1,022 as of 2010.

==History==
The Coast Salish clans that became the Squaxin Island Tribe were historically settled along the seven inlets of the South Puget Sound. These were known as the S&#x27;hotl-Ma-Mish (Carr Inlet), Noo-Seh-Chatl (Henderson Inlet), Steh-Chass (Budd Inlet, around modern-day Olympia), Squi-Aitl (Eld Inlet), T&#x27;Peeksin (Totten Inlet), Sa-Heh-Wa-Mish (Hammersley Inlet), and Squaksin (Case Inlet; which gave the reservation its name). They were speakers of a dialect continuum in the Salishan language family known as Lushootseed. Together with the Twana and Suquamish, they numbered about 1,000 in 1780. Unlike other peoples of the region, the Squaxin tribes were not dependent on a river system, as the Tumwater Falls blocked salmon from migrating far upstream. Instead, they were oriented towards the saltwater sound and the smaller watersheds directly adjacent to the seven inlets. Extended families lived together in longhouses laid out in villages, and were connected by family ties into a wide system of alliances. The Qwu?gwes site was used as a food processing camp by a nearby Squi-Aitl village for around 700 years. The site shows evidence of the large-scale harvesting of salmon and shellfish. Squaxin traded along routes stretching overland to the Columbia Basin and by sea throughout the Puget Sound.

After decades of trade and intermittent contact, serious white settlement in South Puget Sound began in the 1840s and 50s. In 1853, the Washington Territory was created and included Squaxin lands. In 1854, the newly appointed Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens began to pressure the tribes into treaties ceding their land to the United States. The Squaxin tribes were among the first targeted, and signed the Medicine Creek Treaty on December 26. The treaty surrendered all Squaxin mainland claims in exchange for Squaxin Island, twenty years of cash payments, and recognition of traditional native fishing and hunting rights. The reservations proved far less valuable than the land that had been given up. When the Nisqually realized how poor of a deal they had been given, their Chief Leschi began the Puget Sound War in an attempt to reverse the treaty. Despite not taking up arms, the Squaxin Tribe was forcefully interned on their reservation during the war. The small, forested island provided poor sustenance for the 375 Squaxin tribe members. After the war, most families left the island and returned to living around the South Puget Sound, but without rights to the land.

Initially, the federal government honored its treaties with the tribes, but with increasing numbers of white settlers moving into the area, the settlers began to infringe upon the fishing rights of the native tribes. By 1883, whites had established more than forty salmon canneries. In 1894, there were three canneries in the Puget Sound area; by 1905, there were twenty-four. The whites also began to use new techniques, which prevented a significant portion of the salmon from reaching the tribal fishing areas. When Washington Territory became a state in 1889, the legislature passed &quot;laws to curtail tribal fishing in the name of &#x27;conservation&#x27; but what some scholars described as being designed to protect white fisheries.&quot; The state legislature, by 1897, had banned the use of weirs, which were customarily used by Indigenous fishermen.

During the 1960s and 70s, Indians in Washington States were inspired by the ongoing Civil Rights Movement to demand that Washington State honor its treaty obligations. Through civil disobedience and demonstrations, Native activists such as Billy Frank, Jr. tried to assert their right to fish. In 1970, the US Attorney General finally filed suit against the state, and the Squaxin Island Tribe was one of the tribes called on to provide expert witnesses. In the famous Boldt decision, the US District Court recognized the tribes&#x27; original right to fish, and the decision was upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court. Since the decision, the Squaxin Island Tribe has become one of the tribal co-managers of the state&#x27;s fisheries, and many tribal members get their income from the annual salmon catch.

The Squaxin Island Tribe was one of the first Native American tribes in the U.S. to enter into the Self Governance Demonstration Project with the federal government.

==Culture and religion==
Storytelling was done through songs, which were accompanied with dances done to the beat of a drum. Other importance practices included the carving of cedar canoes, the weaving of baskets and fishing nets, and face-painting done with red and black hues made from ground-up rocks. Like the other peoples of the coastal northwest, upper-class Squaxin engaged in head-flattening, where infants had their foreheads compressed in a lateral direction.

Traditional Squaxin religious beliefs were similar to those of other tribes in the Pacific Northwest, and involved shamanism. For several decades after the Puget Sound War, many Squaxins continued to practice these traditional beliefs. A new religious movement began in 1882 when Squaxin John Slocum founded the Indian Shaker Church after a near-death experience. Blending Catholic, Protestant, and indigenous religious elements, the church emphasized personal communication with God over written texts. The movement quickly spread throughout the Pacific Northwest. Native American religious movements were suppressed after the Battle of Wounded Knee, and Indian Shakers faced persecution from the Federal Government. Nonetheless, by the end of the twentieth century there were still more than 2,000 adherents. Today, most Squaxins consider themselves Protestant.

==Present-day tribe==

As of 2010, the Squaxin tribe had 1,022 registered members, up from 302 in 1984. The 2020 census showed 509 residents living on tribal lands (reservation and trust), up from 445 in 2000. The majority of these residents consider themselves Native American alone (281) or of mixed race (126).

=== Reservation and Trust Lands ===

In recent years, the Squaxin Island Indian Reservation has acquired more land in and around their older holdings. In the 1970s they acquired land in Kamilche where many of tribal members live, placing it under trust with the Department of the Interior. The tribe pressured the 31-acre Squaxin Island State Park into closing in the 1990s, and in 2015 purchased the property. In December 2021, Squaxin Island Tribe came to an agreement with Port Blakely Companies, a family owned timber company, to reacquire 1,000 acres of the tribe&#x27;s ancestral land. Two miles of waterfront and 125 acres of tidelands on Little Skookum Inlet in Mason County were returned to the tribe, free of charge. The return of the shoreline restored the tribe&#x27;s direct access to Puget Sound, and some of the most productive shellfish beds in the region. In a separate transaction, the tribe purchased 875 acres of upland forest for an undisclosed sum. The so-called Kamilche property was acquired by Port Blakely following the signing of the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty 167 years prior. Tribal chairman Kris Peters said the tribe has no plans to develop the property. The land will be used for nature conservation and ceremonial purposes.

Overall, the Squaxin Tribe owns in Kamilche, two parcels of off-reservation trust land near Kamilche, as well as a plot of across Pickering Passage from Squaxin Island and a plot of on Harstine Island, across Peale Passage. The total land area including off-reservation trust lands is 6.942 km2 (2.68 sq mi, or 1,715.46 acres).

=== Museum ===
Construction began on the Squaxin Island Museum, Library and Research Center (MLRC) in 1999 and it was opened in 2002. Built to educate both Squaxins and visitors on the culture of the Squaxin people, the structure was shaped to resemble Thunderbird in profile. The property the museum and cultural center stands on was gifted to the tribe by the Taylor family of nearby Taylor Shellfish. The MLRC offers guided tours, cultural classes, and numerous exhibits, among other activities.

===Paddle to Squaxin Island 2012===
In 2012, the Squaxin Island Tribe was chosen to host the annual Tribal Canoe Journey. The Journeys are annual events organized by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest to revive traditional techniques of timber harvesting, making large, ocean-going canoes, and teaching canoe skills to new generations. An estimated 40,000 people attended or visited the &quot;Paddle to Squaxin Island&quot; journey, hosted by the Squaxin Museum and The Evergreen State College, and funded by a National Endowment for the Arts &quot;Our Town&quot; grant. Protocol and dining were held in an old baseball field. The quiet community was loud for a whole week. Months before the event, major construction was done. Many parking lots were made, a campground was built and a Reflecting Pond was put in the Tribal Government Campus. A total of 102 canoes landed on Squaxin for the &quot;Paddle to Squaxin Island&quot; journey.

===Economic activity===
Fishing and lumber are major industries. The tribe operates Salish Cliffs Golf, the Skookum Creek Tobacco Company, and the Little Creek Casino and Resort. Adjacent to the casino is &quot;Elevation&quot;, which became the first tribally owned legal cannabis retail store in the United States in November, 2015.

<doc id="311643" wikidata="Q1195253" url="?curid=311643" title="Sea shanty">
<text>A sea shanty, shanty, chantey, or chanty () is a genre of traditional folk song that was once commonly sung as a work song to accompany rhythmical labor aboard large merchant sailing vessels. The term &quot;shanty&quot; most accurately refers to a specific style of work song belonging to this historical repertoire. However, in recent, popular usage, the scope of its definition is sometimes expanded to admit a wider range of repertoire and characteristics, or to refer to a &quot;maritime work song&quot; in general.

From Latin &quot;cantare&quot; via French &quot;chanter&quot;, the word &quot;shanty&quot; emerged in the mid-19th century in reference to an appreciably distinct genre of work song, developed especially on merchant vessels, that had come to prominence in the decades prior to the American Civil War. Shanty songs functioned to synchronize and thereby optimize labor, in what had then become larger vessels having smaller crews and operating on stricter schedules. The practice of singing shanties eventually became ubiquitous internationally and throughout the era of wind-driven packet and clipper ships.

Shanties had antecedents in the working chants of British and other national maritime traditions, such as those sung while manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were then adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.

The shanty genre was typified by flexible lyrical forms, which in practice provided for much improvisation and the ability to lengthen or shorten a song to match the circumstances. Its hallmark was call and response, performed between a soloist and the rest of the workers in chorus. The leader, called the &quot;shantyman&quot;, was appreciated for his piquant language, lyrical wit, and strong voice. Shanties were sung without instrumental accompaniment and, historically speaking, they were only sung in work-based rather than entertainment-oriented contexts. Although most prominent in English, shanties have been created in or translated into other European languages.

The switch to steam-powered ships and the use of machines for shipboard tasks by the end of the 19th century meant that shanties gradually ceased to serve a practical function. Their use as work songs became negligible in the first half of the 20th century. Information about shanties was preserved by veteran sailors and folklorist song-collectors, and their written and audio-recorded work provided resources that would later support a revival in singing shanties as a land-based leisure activity. Commercial musical recordings, popular literature, and other media, especially since the 1920s, have inspired interest in shanties among s. Contemporary performances of these songs range from the &quot;traditional&quot; style of maritime music to various modern music genres.

==Word==
===Etymology===
The origin of the word &quot;shanty&quot; is unknown, though several inconclusive theories have been put forth. One of the earliest and most consistently offered derivations is from the French , &quot;to sing&quot;.

The phenomenon of using songs or chants, in some form, to accompany sea labor preceded the emergence of the term &quot;shanty&quot; in the historical record of the mid-19th century. One of the earliest published uses of this term for such a song came in G. E. Clark&#x27;s &quot;Seven Years of a Sailor&#x27;s Life&quot;, 1867. Narrating a voyage in a clipper ship from Bombay to New York City in the early 1860s, Clark wrote, &quot;The anchor came to the bow with the chanty of &#x27;Oh, Riley, Oh,&#x27; and &#x27;Carry me Long,&#x27; and the tug walked us toward the wharf at Brooklyn.&quot; While telling of another voyage out of Provincetown, Mass. in 1865, he wrote:
Every man sprang to duty. The cheerful chanty was roared out, and heard above the howl of the gale. The cable held very hard, and when it surged over, the windlass sent the men flying about the deck, as if a galvanic battery had been applied to their hands. The vessel&#x27;s head was often buried in the solid seas, and the men, soaked and sweating, yelled out hoarsely, &quot;Paddy on the Railway&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re Homeward Bound&quot;, while they tugged at the brakes, and wound the long, hard cable in, inch by inch.
Additionally, Clark referred to a lead singer as a &quot;chanty man&quot;, and he referred to stevedores unloading cargo from the vessels as &quot;chanty men&quot; and a &quot;chanty gang&quot;.

This reference to singing stevedores as &quot;chanty men&quot; connects the genre to a still earlier reference to &quot;chanty-man&quot; as the foreman of a work gang and the lead singer of their songs. Around the late 1840s, Charles Nordhoff observed work gangs engaged in a type of labor called &quot;cotton-screwing&quot; in Mobile Bay. Characterized by Nordhoff as one of the heaviest sorts of labor, cotton-screwing involved the use of large jack-screws to compress and force cotton bales into the holds of outbound ships. Work gangs consisted of four men, who timed their exertions in turning the jack-screw to songs called &quot;chants&quot;.
Singing, or &quot;chanting&quot; as it is called, is an invariable accompaniment to working in cotton, and many of the screw-gangs have an endless collection of songs, rough and uncouth, both in words and melody, but answering well the purposes of making all pull together, and enlivening the heavy toil. The foreman is the &quot;chanty-man&quot;, who sings the song, the gang only joining in the chorus, which comes in at the end of every line, and at the end of which again comes the pull at the screw handles ...&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;chants&quot;, as may be supposed, have more of rhyme than reason in them. The tunes are generally plaintive and monotonous, as are most of the capstan tunes of sailors, but resounding over the still waters of the Bay, they had a fine effect.

According to research published in the journal &quot;American Speech&quot;, Schreffler argues that &quot;chanty&quot; may have been a back derivation from &quot;chanty-man&quot;, which, further, initially carried the connotation of a singing stevedore (as in Nordhoff&#x27;s account, above). The historical record shows &quot;shanty&quot; (and its variant spellings) gaining currency only in the late nineteenth century; the same repertoire was earlier referred to as &quot;song&quot;, &quot;chant&quot;, or &quot;chaunt&quot;.

===Spelling===
The spelling of the term appeared quite inconsistently until after the 1920s. While the above noted, American sources used a &quot;ch&quot; spelling, the next published appearances of the term, coming in two very similar articles from British publications from 1868 and 1869, used &quot;shanty&quot;. Early writers who gave substantial due to the genre (i.e. those who were not mentioning shanties only in passing) often used the &quot;ch&quot; spelling, regardless of their nationality.

Addressing the Royal Musical Association in 1915, English musicologist Richard Runciman Terry put forward his belief that the genre should be spelled with &quot;sh&quot; on the grounds that the spelling should correspond obviously to pronunciation. In his subsequent shanty collections he used this spelling consistently. American shanty-collector Joanna Colcord made great use of Terry&#x27;s first book (corresponding with the author, and reprinting some of his material), and she, too, deemed it sensible to adopt the &quot;sh&quot; spelling for her 1924 collection.

Terry&#x27;s works were the source for those among the earliest of commercial recordings (see below) and popular performances of shanties—especially because, unlike many earlier works, they provided scores with piano accompaniment and sufficiently long, performance-ready sets of lyrics. Colcord&#x27;s work was also very handy in this regard and was used as a source by prominent British folk revival performers like A. L. Lloyd and Ewan MacColl. Terry and Colcord&#x27;s works were followed by numerous shanty collections and scores that also chose to use the &quot;Sh&quot; spelling, whereas others remained insistent that &quot;ch&quot; be retained to preserve what they believed to be the etymological origins of the term. By the late 20th century, the &quot;Sh&quot; spelling had become the more or less standard one in Commonwealth English, whereas &quot;ch&quot; spellings remained in common use mostly in the United States.

During the 1920s, the phrase came into regular use by lay commentators, though it was not documented in use by sailors themselves, nor has it been used by knowledgeable authors on the subject such as Stan Hugill. The term &quot;sea shanty/chantey&quot; has become a staple of popular usage, where it helps to disambiguate the work song genre from other meanings of the word &quot;shanty&quot;. For example, the &quot;ice fishing shanty&quot;, despite its reference to marine activity, is not related.

==History and development==
===Emergence===
Singing or chanting has been done to accompany labor on seagoing vessels among various cultural groups at various times and in various places. A reference to what seems to be a sailor&#x27;s hauling chant in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; (1549) is a popularly cited example. Liberal use of the word &quot;shanty&quot; by folklorists of the 20th century expanded the term&#x27;s conceptual scope to include &quot;sea-related work songs&quot; in general. However, the shanty genre is distinct among various global work song phenomena. Its formal characteristics, specific manner of use, and repertoire cohere to form a picture of a work song genre that emerged in the Atlantic merchant trade of the early 19th century. As original work songs, shanties flourished during a period of about fifty years.

====Work chants and &quot;sing-outs&quot;====
There is a notable lack of historical references to anything like shanties, as they would come to be known, in the entirety of the 18th century. In the second half of the 18th century, English and French sailors were using simple chants to coordinate a few shipboard tasks that required unanimous effort. A dictionary of maritime terms, in describing the anchor-hauling mechanical device known as a windlass, noted the use of such a chant. This particular old-fashioned style of windlass was one that required workers to continually remove and re-insert &quot;handspikes&quot; (wooden leverage bars) into the device to turn its gears.

It requires, however, some dexterity and address to manage the handspec to the greatest advantage; and to perform this the sailors must all rise at once upon the windlass, and, fixing their bars therein, give a sudden jerk at the same instant, in which movement they are regulated by a sort of song or howl pronounced by one of their number.

Rather than the well-developed songs that characterize shanties, this &quot;howl&quot; and others were evidently structured as simple chants in the manner of &quot;1, 2, &quot;3&quot;!&quot; The same dictionary noted that French sailors said just that, and gave some indication what an English windlass chant may have been like:

&quot;UN, deux, troi&quot;, an exclamation, or song, used by seamen when hauling the bowlines, the greatest effort being made at the last word. English sailors, in the same manner, call out on this occasion,—haul-in—haul-two—haul-belay!

Such simple or brief chants survived into the 19th century. First-hand observers such as Frederick Pease Harlow, a sailor of the 1870s, attested to their ubiquity, saying that they were brought into use whenever a brief task required one. In historical hindsight these items have come to be generically called &quot;sing-outs&quot;; yet even before the known advent of the term &quot;shanty&quot;, Richard Henry Dana referred to &quot;singing out&quot;.

The wind was whistling through the rigging, loose ropes flying about; loud and, to me, unintelligible orders constantly given and rapidly executed, and the sailors &quot;singing out&quot; at the ropes in their hoarse and peculiar strains.

Later writers distinguished such chants and &quot;sing-outs&quot; from shanties proper, but in the case of relatively &quot;simple&quot; shanties—such as those for hauling sheets and tacks (see below)—there is a grey area. This has led some to believe that the more sophisticated shanties of later years developed from the more primitive chants.

====Early British and Anglo-American sailor work songs====
A step up in sophistication from the sing-outs was represented by the first widely established sailors&#x27; work song of the 19th century, &quot;Cheer&#x27;ly Man&quot;. Although other work-chants were evidently too variable, non-descript, or incidental to receive titles, &quot;Cheer&#x27;ly Man&quot; appears referred to by name several times in the early part of the century, and it lived on alongside later-styled shanties to be remembered even by sailors recorded by James Madison Carpenter in the 1920s. &quot;Cheer&#x27;ly Man&quot; makes notable appearances in the work of both Dana (sea experience 1834–36) and Herman Melville (sea experience 1841–42).

When we came to mast-head the top-sail yards, with all hands at the halyards, we struck up &quot;Cheerily, men,&quot; with a chorus which might have been heard half way to Staten Land.

The decks were all life and commotion; the sailors on the forecastle singing, &quot;Ho, cheerly men!&quot; as they catted the anchor;

Although &quot;Cheer&#x27;ly Man&quot; could be considered more &quot;developed&quot; than the average sing-out, in its form it is yet different from the majority of shanties that are known to us today, suggesting that it belonged to an earlier stage of sailors&#x27; songs that preceded the emergence of &quot;modern&quot; shanties.

Detailed reference to shipboard practices that correspond to shanty-singing was extremely rare before the 1830s. In the first place, singing while working was generally limited to merchant ships, not war ships. The Royal Navy banned singing during work—it was thought the noise would make it harder for the crew to hear commands—though capstan work was accompanied by the bosun&#x27;s pipe, or else by fife and drum or fiddle. A writer from the 1830s made this clear: 

On board a well-disciplined man-of-war, no person except the officers is allowed to speak during the performance of the various evolutions. When a great many men are employed together, a fifer or a fiddler usually plays some of their favourite tunes; and it is quite delightful to see the glee with which Jack will &quot;stamp and go&quot;, keeping exact time to &quot;Jack&#x27;s the lad&quot;, or the &quot;College Hornpipe&quot;.

Fife and fiddle were also used, in earlier times, for work aboard merchant vessels.

One of the earliest references to shanty-like songs that has been discovered was made by an anonymous &quot;steerage passenger&quot; in a log of a voyage of an East India Company ship, entitled &quot;The Quid&quot; (1832). Crew and passengers alike were noted to join in at heaving the capstan around. They were said to sing &quot;old ditties&quot;, along with which a few verses to one or more songs is given. While this practice was analogous to the practice of what is later called singing &quot;capstan shanties&quot;, the form of these verses is not particularly similar to later shanties. These songs do not appear to correspond to any shanty known from later eras. It is possible that the long, monotonous task of heaving the capstan had long inspired the singing of time-passing songs of various sorts, such as those in &quot;The Quid&quot;. For example, the composition of capstan-style &quot;sailor songs&quot; by Norwegian poet Henrik Wergeland as early as 1838 implies that Scandinavians also used such songs. However, these older songs can be distinguished from the later type of songs that were given the label &quot;shanty&quot;, suggesting there were other formative influences that gave birth to an appreciably new and distinctly recognized phenomenon.

====Influence of African-American and Caribbean work songs====

Use of the term &quot;shanty&quot;, once this paradigm for singing had become a comprehensive practice for most tasks, incorporated all manner of shipboard work songs under its definition, regardless of style and origin. Yet, shanties were of several types, and not all had necessarily developed at the same time. &quot;Capstan shanties&quot;, some of which may have developed out of the earlier capstan songs discussed above, are quite variable in their form and origins. On the other hand, the repertoire of the so-called &quot;halyard shanties&quot; coheres into a consistent form. The distinctive &quot;double-pull&quot; format that typifies most of these songs—also at times used, with slight changes, for pumps, windlass, and capstan, too—was a later development that appears to owe much to African-American work songs.

In the first few decades of the 19th century, European-American culture, especially the Anglophone—the sailors&#x27; &quot;Cheer&#x27;ly Man&quot; and some capstan songs notwithstanding—was not known for its work songs. By contrast, African workers, both in Africa and in the New World, were widely noted to sing while working. According to Gibb Schreffler, an Associate Professor of Music at Pomona College, European observers found African work-singers remarkable (as Schreffler infers from tone of their descriptions). Schreffler further infers that work songs may have had far less currency among European culture, based on the scant evidence of work-singing aboard European ships in the century prior. Such references begin to appear in the late 18th century, whence one can see the cliché develop that Black Africans &quot;could not&quot; work without singing. For example, an observer in Martinique in 1806 wrote, &quot;The negroes have a different air and words for every kind of labour; sometimes they sing, and their motions, even while cultivating the ground, keep time to the music.&quot; So while the depth of the African-American work song traditions is now recognized, in the early 19th century they stood in stark contrast to the paucity of such traditions among European-Americans. Thus while European sailors had learned to put short chants to use for certain kinds of labor, the paradigm of a comprehensive system of developed work songs for most tasks may have been contributed by the direct involvement of or through the imitation of African-Americans. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included:
* Boat-rowing on rivers of the south-eastern U.S. and Caribbean;
* Corn-shucking parties on plantations of the south-eastern U.S.;
* The work of stokers or &quot;firemen&quot;, who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;
* Stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean—including &quot;cotton-screwing&quot; (using a large jackscrew to compress and force cotton bales into the holds of outbound ships at ports of the American South).

During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African-Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.

An example of a work song that was shared between several contexts, including, eventually, sailors working, is &quot;Grog Time o&#x27; Day&quot;. This song, the tune of which is now lost, was sung by: Jamaican stevedores at a capstan in 1811; Afro-Caribbeans rowing a boat in Antigua ca.1814; Black stevedores loading a steamboat in New Orleans in 1841; and a European-American crew hauling halyards on a clipper-brig out of New York ca.1840s. Other such multi-job songs were: &quot;Round the Corn(er), Sally&quot;, &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, &quot;Johnny Come Down to Hilo&quot;, &quot;Hilo, Boys, Hilo&quot;, &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Gone Away&quot;, &quot;The Sailor Likes His Bottle-O&quot;, &quot;Highland Laddie&quot;, &quot;Mudder Dinah&quot;, &quot;Bully in the Alley&quot;, &quot;Hogeye Man&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Ladies, All&quot;, &quot;Pay Me the Money Down&quot;, &quot;Alabama, John Cherokee&quot;, &quot;Yankee John, Stormalong&quot;, and &quot;Heave Away (My Johnnies)&quot;.

While the non-sailor occupations noted above were mainly within the purview of Black laborers, the last of them, cotton-screwing, was one in which non-Blacks also began to engage by the 1840s. These workers often came from the ranks of sailors of the trans-Atlantic cotton trade, including sailors from Britain and Ireland who, wanting to avoid the cold winter seasons on the Atlantic, went ashore to engage in the well-paid labor of cotton-screwing. A European-American who did just that in 1845 in New Orleans wrote,

The day after our arrival the crew formed themselves into two gangs and obtained employment at screwing cotton by the day ... With the aid of a set of jack-screws and a ditty, we would stow away huge bales of cotton, singing all the while. The song enlivened the gang and seemed to make the work much easier.

Shanty-writer Stan Hugill called Mobile Bay—one of the main cotton outports—a &quot;shanty mart&quot;, at which sailors and laborers of different cultural backgrounds traded their songs.

====Perceptions of contemporary observers====
Commenters on the ethnic or national origins of shanties, writing in the 19th century when shanties were still in wide use, generally supposed the genre to originate in the United States and recognized parallels to African-American singing—as opposed to earlier English traditions from Britain. An early article to offer an opinion on the origin of shanties (though not calling them by that name), appearing in Oberlin College&#x27;s student paper in 1858, drew a comparison between Africans&#x27; singing and sailor work songs.

Along the African coast you will hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or paddling their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations you will hear it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor ... And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.

The author went on to relate an incident in which he once heard &quot;a well known strain of music&quot;, finding to his surprise that it was being sung by Black men rowing canoes. He claimed they were singing, &quot;Heigh Jim along, Jim along Josey, Heigh Jim along, Jim along Jo!&quot; The implication is that this song was similar to a sailor song, probably the well-known shanty, &quot;Haul Away, Joe&quot; or &quot;Haul Away for Rosie&quot;, viz.: &quot;Way, haul away; O, haul away, my Rosey; Way, haul away; O, haul away, &quot;Joe&quot;.&quot; The writer did not make a further connection to the minstrel song &quot;Jim Along Josey&quot;, a relationship to which is obvious, although it is unknown whether this was the inspiration for the shanty or vice versa.

In much of the shanty repertoire known today one finds parallels to the minstrel songs that came to popularity from the 1840s. The poetic meter of the couplets of many minstrel songs is identical to those in shanties, and the &quot;non sequitur&quot;-type &quot;floating verses&quot; of those songs were heavily borrowed. In an influential early article about shanties, New York journalist William L. Alden drew a comparison between shanties and &quot;both&quot; authentic African-American songs and the quasi-African-American minstrel songs:

The old sailor songs had a peculiar individuality. They were barbaric in their wild melody. The only songs that in any way resemble them in character are &quot;Dixie&quot;, and two or three other so-called negro songs by the same writer. This man, known in the minstrel profession as &quot;Old Emmett&quot;, caught the true spirit of the African melodies—the lawless, half-mournful, half-exulting songs of the Kroomen. These and the sailor songs could never have been the songs of civilized men ...
Undoubtedly many sailor songs have a negro origin. They are the reminiscences of melodies sung by negroes stowing cotton in the holds of ships in Southern ports. The &quot;shanty-men&quot;, those hards of the forecastle, have preserved to some extent the meaningless words of negro choruses, and have modified the melodies so as to fit them for salt-water purposes. Certain other songs were unmistakably the work of English sailors of an uncertain but very remote period.

Alden was not writing as a research historian, but rather as an observer of the then-current shanty-singing. His, then, was an impression of shanties based on their style and manner of performance, and he was writing at a time when shanties had yet to become framed by writers and media as belonging to any canon of national &quot;folk music&quot;.

An English author of the period, William Clark Russell, expressed his belief in several works that shanties were American in origin.

I think it may be taken that we owe the sailors&#x27; working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is noteworthy that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.

As time wore on and shanties were established as an indispensable tool aboard the ships of many nations carrying heterogeneous crew, inspiration from several national and cultural traditions fed into the repertoire and their style was subsequently shaped by countless individuals. Whatever their fundamental origins, by the late 19th century shanties constituted the heritage of international seamen, with little or no necessary national associations.

===19th century===
====New ships and new requirements====
Writers have characterized the origin of shanties (or perhaps a &quot;revival&quot; in shanties, as William Main Doerflinger theorized) as belonging to an era immediately following the War of 1812 and up to the American Civil War. This was a time when there was relative peace on the seas and shipping was flourishing. Packet ships carried cargo and passengers on fixed schedules across the globe. Packet ships were larger and yet sailed with fewer crew than vessels of earlier eras, in addition to the fact that they were expected on strict schedules. These requirements called for an efficient and disciplined use of human labor. American vessels, especially, gained reputations for cruelty as officers demanded high results from their crew. The shanties of the 19th century could be characterized as a sort of new &quot;technology&quot; adopted by sailors to adapt to this way of shipboard life.

Recent research has considered a wider range of 19th century sources than had been possible by 20th-century writers. The evidence from these sources suggests that even in the mid-1830s the genre was still developing, which shifts the period of the rise and flourishing of shanties to a bit later than was previously accepted. The general silence of the historical record on modern shanties until as late as the 1840s, even as shipping shifted to the even faster clipper ships, suggests that they may not have come into widespread use until the middle of the century. They received a boost from the heavy emigrant movement of gold rushes in California and Australia. Popular shanties of the 1850s included &quot;A Hundred Years Ago&quot;, &quot;One More Day&quot;, &quot;Santiana&quot;, &quot;Haul on the Bowline&quot;, &quot;Across the Western Ocean&quot;, and especially &quot;Stormalong&quot;.

====Heyday and decline====
By the time of the American Civil War, the shanty form was fully developed, after which its repertoire grew and its implementation was widespread and rather standardized. The decade of the 1870s represents the zenith of the genre; those sailors who first went to sea after that decade are considered not to have seen shanties in their prime. In 1882, due to the proliferation of steamships, Alden was already lamenting the passing of shanties.

The &quot;shanty-man&quot;—the chorister of the old packet ship—has left no successors. In the place of a rousing &quot;pulling song&quot;, we now hear the rattle of the steam-winch; and the modern windlass worked by steam, or the modern steam-pump, gives us the clatter of cogwheels and the hiss of steam in place of the wild choruses of other days. Singing and steam are irreconcilable. The hoarse steam-whistle is the nearest approach to music that can exist in the hot, greasy atmosphere of the steam-engine.

Other writers echoed Alden&#x27;s lament through and after the 1880s; the first collections of shanties appeared in that decade, in one sense as a response to what the authors believed was a vanishing art. Shanties continued to be used to some extent so long as windjammers were, yet these were comparatively few in the early 20th century.

===20th century===

====Formative writing====
Folklorists of the first decade of the 20th century, especially those from Britain, included shanties among their interests in collecting folk songs connected with the idea of national heritage. Cecil Sharp and his colleagues among the English Folk-Song Society were among the first to take down the lyrics and tunes of shanties directly from the lips of veteran sailors and to publish them more or less faithfully. Their efforts were matched by a number of less-rigorous articles and published collections issued by former sailors themselves. By the 1920s, the body of literature on shanties had grown quite large, yet it was of variable quality. Most editors presented &quot;ideal&quot; versions of songs—not reflecting any one way the shanty may have been sung, but rather a composite picture, edited for print. Bowdlerization and omission of lyrics were typical. Moreover, few authors were trained folklorists and even fewer maintained a critical historical methodology. Editors customarily published fanciful, often nostalgic introductions to the material that included unsubstantiated statements. As a result, though much of the vanishing shanty repertoire was preserved in skeletal form, aspects of the genre were re-envisioned according to contemporary perceptions.

These early 20th century collectors&#x27; choices of what to include, what to exclude, and how to frame the repertoire all had an effect on how following generations have viewed the genre. Because sailors who had sung shanties were by this time very old or dead, and the general public had little opportunity to experience performances of shanties, the representations by these authors were all the more influential in mediating information and creating the impression of &quot;standard&quot; versions of songs.

The English poet John Masefield, following in the footsteps of peers like Rudyard Kipling, seized upon shanties as a nostalgic literary device, and included them along with much older, non-shanty sea songs in his 1906 collection &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Garland&quot;. Although Masefield had sea experience (1891–95), he was not an expert on shanties and the versions he gave of songs cannot be assumed entirely authentic. For example, he admits to never having heard a pumping shanty, and yet he goes on to present one without citing its source. In one of his earlier articles, his shanties are set to melodies taken verbatim from Davis and Tozer&#x27;s earlier work, and he mentions having utilized that and the other widely available collection (L.A. Smith, 1888) as resources. Masefield desired to connect shanties with much older English traditions and literature, and his characterization of individual items as such would prove attractive to later enthusiasts. So for example, Masefield implied that the shanty &quot;A-roving&quot; (which he titled &quot;The Maid of Amsterdam&quot;) was derived from Thomas Heywood&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of the Rape of Lucrece&quot; (1608). Lyrics and ideas from Masefield&#x27;s collection became among the most quoted or plagiarized in later shanty collections, and by their sheer ubiquity these contributed to 20th century audiences&#x27; perceptions of the genre.

The 1914 collection by Frank Thomas Bullen, &quot;Songs of Sea Labour&quot;, differed from the work of writers such as Masefield in having a more practical, rather than romantic, tone. Bullen, an Englishman, was an experienced shantyman, who sailed during the heyday of shanties to ports in the Southern U.S. and the Caribbean. He took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection, thus resisting the temptation to let shanties slide into the genres of ballads or other off-duty songs. (Pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs, clearly demarcated, at the end of the book.) And rather than shape the shanties to appear as narrative pieces, he noted that, since most shanties would usually be improvised, it would be disingenuous to present more than one or two sample verses. As for his framing of the genre&#x27;s origins, Bullen stated his belief that, &quot;[T]he great majority of these tunes undoubtably emanated from the negroes of the Antilles and the Southern states, a most tuneful race if ever there was one, men moreover who seemed unable to pick up a ropeyarn without a song ...&quot; And Bullen&#x27;s musicologist editor, Arnold, claimed, &quot;[T]he majority of the Chanties are Negroid in origin ...&quot; Bullen&#x27;s insistence on including only true work songs in the collection meant that he likely omitted songs—generally those for heaving tasks, like capstan work—which had been easily borrowed from the land-based traditions of various nations. The effect of including only the most exclusively work-oriented songs meant that a higher percentage of African-American songs were represented.

Somewhere between these perspectives was Cecil Sharp&#x27;s, whose &quot;English Folk-Chanteys&quot; (1914) was published in the same year, and was based on shanties he collected from aged English sailors in Britain. Sharp responds to Bullen&#x27;s claims of African-American origins by ceding that many shanties were influenced through the singing of Black shantymen—a position that assumes English folk song was the core of the tradition by default. The title of Sharp&#x27;s work reflects his project of collecting and grouping shanties as part of what he conceived to be a rather continuous English folk song tradition. Sharp states in the introduction that he deliberately excluded shanties which were obviously (i.e. to him) born of popular songs. This idea is problematic when one considers that the popular songs that were feeding shanties were largely American and based in real or imagined African-American musical traits. However, Sharp believed that by eliminating such shanties based on popular songs, he could concentrate those that were &quot;folk&quot; songs. Of his own admission, Sharp lacked any shantying or sea experience to intuitively judge shanties like someone such as Bullen, however he offers his objectivity, recording precisely what was sung to him, as consolation. While Sharp&#x27;s manner of documenting shanties was more or less objective, the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study. And whereas Bullen&#x27;s work was fairly inaccessible, Sharp was influential as the leader of a cohort of scholars who were actively creating the young field of folk song research.

By the 1920s, the proliferation of shanty collections had begun to facilitate a revival in shanty singing as entertainment for laypersons (see below), which in turn created a market for more shanty collections that were geared towards a general audience. Writers of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, through their derivative, popular works, established in effect a new body of &quot;common knowledge&quot; about shanties that overwrote some of the knowledge of 19th century observers.

====Field-recording====
Shanty collection was seen as a facet of the early twentieth century folk revival. The Australian-born composer and folklorist Percy Grainger collected various shanties and recorded them on wax cylinders in the early 1900s, and the recordings are available online courtesy of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library.

In the 1920s, while the proliferation of soft-scholarly books was reifying the shanty repertoire, a few American scholars were audio-recording some of the last surviving sailors that had sung shanties as part of their daily work: in short, field recording. James Madison Carpenter, made hundreds of recordings of shanties from singers in Britain, Ireland, and the north-eastern U.S. in the late 1920s, allowing him to make observation from an extensive set of field data. Robert Winslow Gordon, founding head of the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress, recorded sailors singing shanties in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 1920s, and later made recordings of African-American work songs in Georgia and elsewhere, seeking to demonstrate correspondences between these and the shanty genre. Neither of these scholars had the opportunity, however, to publish major works on shanties. Similarly, Alan Lomax&#x27;s work starting in the 1930s, especially his field recordings of work songs in the Caribbean and Southern U.S., makes a significant contribution to the information on extant shanty-related traditions.

From the 1940s to the 1960s, Canadian folklorist Helen Creighton collected shanties from Nova Scotia seamen, such as &#x27;Blow the Man Down&#x27;, &#x27;Whiskey Johnny&#x27;, &#x27;The Sailor&#x27;s Alphabet&#x27;, &#x27;Shenandoah&#x27; and &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. Lastly, William Main Doerflinger carefully recorded and collected shanties from singers in New York and Nova Scotia in the 1930s and 1940s, the result of which was his &quot;Songs of the Sailor and Lumberman&quot;.

English folklorist Peter Kennedy recorded Stanley Slade of Bristol, England, thought to be &#x27;The Last Shantyman&#x27;, singing several shanties including &#x27;Haul Away, Joe&#x27;, &#x27;Leave Her, Johnny&#x27; and &#x27;Shenandoah&#x27;, and the recordings are available online via the British Library Sound Archive.

====Stan Hugill and &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot;====
One of the most celebrated volumes on shanties produced in the 20th century is Stan Hugill&#x27;s &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot; (1961). It is the largest of its kind, owing to Hugill&#x27;s methodology and chronological position. With respect to methodology, Hugill aimed to be as inclusive as possible—to account for and to present, if sometimes only in fragments, any and all items of shanty repertoire that he was currently able to find. Any song that he had heard or read being attested as having been ever &quot;used as shanty&quot; was included—regardless of whether that song was not generally known as a shanty or if its use as a shanty was rare and incidental. The result is a varied portrait of the genre, highlighting its maximum diversity without, however, giving a focused sense of what songs were most common during the heyday of shanties or in latter eras. Hugill readily included more recently popular songs—those that evidently were not sung until after the shanty genre was experiencing decline, but which were extant when Hugill sailed (1920s–40s). He also culled from the major collections of non-English-language sailor work songs. Hugill&#x27;s practice of liberally culling from all major prior works, &quot;in combination with&quot; original material from his own field experiences, makes it a handy sourcebook for performers, but a difficult work to assess in terms of historical accuracy.

With respect to chronological position, while Hugill is affectionately known as &quot;The Last Shantyman&quot;, he was also one of the last original shanty &quot;collectors&quot;. A few original collections followed, notably Roger Abrahams&#x27; and Horace Beck&#x27;s works on contemporary shantying in the Caribbean, yet most publications in the &quot;song collection&quot; genre are general anthologies based in Hugill and his predecessors&#x27; works. To a great extent, &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot; is considered the &quot;last word&quot; on shanties and the first stop as a reference. The book&#x27;s &quot;authoritative&quot; position is bolstered by the personal image of its author. In contrast to many of the academic folklorists who had collected shanties before him, Hugill possessed the look and pedigree of an old-time sailor, and he was actually able to perform the songs from his collection at sea music festivals. &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot; and Stan Hugill&#x27;s performances have had a tremendous bearing on how shanties have been understood and performed by enthusiasts since the second half of the 20th century up to today.

====Revival====
Even as shanty singing to accompany work aboard ships was &quot;dying&quot;, interest was being taken in &quot;reviving&quot; it—as a type of leisure pastime. Most shanty singing since the mid-20th century or earlier is considered to be in such a &quot;revival&quot; vein.

A few of the editors of early shanty collections provided arrangements for pianoforte accompaniment with their shanties. While this may have simply been a customary way of presenting songs or attempting to frame their tonality, it may also suggest they hoped their examples could be performed, as well. One of the earliest shanty collections, Davis and Tozer&#x27;s &quot;Sailor Songs or &#x27;Chanties&quot;&#x27; (which circulated in the early 1890s), included such accompaniment, along with safe, &quot;drawing room&quot; style lyrics. It is unknown whether any actual performances were based on this otherwise influential work, however, the proceedings from a meeting of the Manchester Literary Club, 4 February 1895, record an instance of laypersons attempting to recreate shanty performance at that early date. In general, shanty performance by laypersons, up through the first two decades of the 20th century, would have been hindered by the lack of suitable resources, if not lack of interest.

Independent of this literature, a revival of sorts was staged by the U.S. Shipping Board in 1918 when Stanton H. King of Boston, a merchant sailor of the 1880s, was appointed as &quot;Official Chantey Man for the American Merchant Marine.&quot; King taught shanties to the young Merchant Marine recruits, but it appears that they were used more for entertainment than work functions. A description of the daily training schedule included the following note:

Recreation includes singing, for each ship is supplied with a piano. The musical program includes old-time chanties, in which the young men are instructed by a veteran deep-water chantie man.

An on-shore revival in shanty singing for leisure was facilitated by song collections of the 1920s, especially Terry&#x27;s &quot;The Shanty Book&quot; (in two volumes, 1921 and 1926). What set apart this and following collections was full musical score along with an adequate stock of lyrics. Collections prior to Terry&#x27;s (except for Davis and Tozer&#x27;s much earlier and contrived-sounding settings) had not provided enough verses to create &quot;full&quot; songs, and it is unlikely that performers would venture to improvise new verses in the manner of traditional shantymen. By 1926, it had become a custom at the Seven Seas Club in London to hold a shanty sing-along after the club&#x27;s monthly dinners. By 1928, commercial recordings of shanties, performed in the manner of classical concert singing, had been released on HMV, Vocalion, Parlophone, Edison, Aco, and Columbia labels; many were realizations of scores from Terry&#x27;s collection. Shanties like &quot;Johnny Come Down to Hilo&quot; were more or less standardized through popular dissemination.

The next revival in shanties occurred as part of the Anglophone folk music revival of the mid-20th century. The American folk revival group The Almanac Singers were recruited by Alan Lomax to record several shanties for the 1941 album Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads. In Britain, the incorporation of shanties into the folk revival repertoire was largely led by A.L. Lloyd starting in the 1950s. An amateur folklorist, Lloyd discarded the earlier classical style of presentations in favor of a more &quot;authentic&quot; performance style. He was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements; he obviously referred to collections by editors like Sharp, Colcord, and Doerflinger, however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention. Lloyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Singing Sailor&quot; (1955) with Ewan MacColl was an early milestone, which made an impression on Stan Hugill when he was preparing his 1961 collection, particularly as the performance style it embodied was considered more appropriate than that of earlier commercial recordings. Many other performers followed, creating influential versions and interpretations of shanties that persist today. For example, Lloyd&#x27;s personal interpretation of &quot;South Australia&quot; was taken up by the Irish folk revival group The Clancy Brothers, from which this version spread to countless folk performers to become established as the &quot;standard&quot; form of what is usually presented as a &quot;traditional&quot; shanty. The Canadian, Alan Mills (1913-1977), recorded numerous songs for Folkways Records including &quot;Songs of the Sea&quot; (1959). Through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs, the folk revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunes—a sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing. Another effect, due to the fact that most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres, is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of &quot;folk song&quot;, and their distinctive use, manner of performance, and identity were co-opted.

With one foot firmly planted in the world of traditional shanties, the veteran sailor and author Stan Hugill also became a leader (and follower) of trends in the folk music revival. His presence as an exclusive performer of sailor songs did much to establish sea music as a revival genre apart from or within folk music. By the late 1970s, the activities of enthusiasts and scholar-performers at places like the Mystic Seaport Museum (who initiated an annual Sea Music Festival in 1979) and the San Francisco Maritime Museum established sea music—inclusive of shanties, sea songs, and other maritime music—as a genre with its own circuit of festivals, record labels, performance protocol, and so on.

==Nature of the songs==

===Function===
In the days when human muscles were the only power source available aboard ship, shanties served practical functions. The rhythm of the song served to synchronize the movements of the sailors or to pace the labor as they toiled at repetitive tasks. Singing helped to alleviate boredom and to lighten, perhaps, the psychological burden of hard work. Shanties may also be said to have served a social purpose, as to build camaraderie.

===Form===
All shanties had a chorus of some sort, in order to allow the crew to sing all together. Many shanties had a &quot;call and response&quot; format, with one voice (the shantyman) singing the solo lines and the rest of the sailors bellowing short refrains in response (compare military cadence calls).

The &quot;shantyman&quot; was a regular sailor who led the others in singing. He was usually self-appointed. A sailor would not generally sign on as a shantyman &quot;per se&quot;, but took on the role in addition to their other tasks on the ship. Nevertheless, sailors reputed to be good shantymen were valued and respected.

The following example, a verse of the shanty &quot;Boney&quot; (in reference to Napoleon), shows the call and response form and the interplay between the voices of the shantyman and the crew.
&lt;poem&gt;
Shantyman (&quot;solo&quot;): Boney was a warrior,
All (&quot;refrain&quot;): Way-ay-&quot;ya&quot;,
Shantyman (&quot;solo&quot;): A reg&#x27;lar bull and tarrier,
All (&quot;refrain&quot;): John Fran&quot;çois!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

When working this as a &quot;short-drag&quot; shanty (see below), hands on the line would synchronize their pulls with the last syllable of each response (in italics).

===Lyrical content===
The practical function of shanties as work songs was given priority over their lyrics or the musicality of a performance. Due to this, shanty texts might have been poor from an aesthetic standpoint—even at times random nonsense—so long as the singing fit the form of the work song. One writer about shanties warned his readers that their lyrics, to landsmen, would &quot;probably appear as the veriest doggerel.&quot; He went on to explain,

As a rule, the chantey in its entirety possesses neither rhyme nor reason; nevertheless, it is admirably fitted for sailors&#x27; work. Each of these sea-songs has a few stock verses or phrases to begin with, but after these are sung, the soloist must improvise, and it is principally his skill in this direction that marks the successful chantey-man.

Improvisation and stock verses were the tools of the trade of shantymen. Similar to the blues, shanties often exhibited a string of such verses without much explicit or continuous theme. While on one hand this may simply reflect the aesthetic of the music-culture from which the form originated, this, too, was a feature suited to practical restrictions. Work tasks might be of any length and often unpredictable. Songs with a fixed set of verses, or ballads, which tell a story, were not so well suited to tasks that could end abruptly at any time or that might require extending.

Improvising of lyrics in such a context could be seen as an African-American musical characteristic, as Euro-American observers of Black work-singing consistently remarked on its extempore nature. Stock verses helped the shantyman fill space when his creative faculties came up short. These might take the form of multipurpose clichés, like,
&lt;poem&gt;
Up aloft this yard must go.
[refrain]
Up aloft from down below.
[refrain]&lt;/poem&gt;

Or, the shantyman may use formulas, like &quot;Were you ever in [blank]?&quot;, for example,
&lt;poem&gt;
Were you ever down in Mobile Bay?
[refrain]
A-screwing cotton by the day?
[refrain]&lt;/poem&gt;

(The refrain in these cases may be any; that is, the stock verses may be fitted to any of a number of shanties having a similar tune-chorus form.)

Many stock verses used phrases that &quot;floated&quot; between both minstrel and authentic African-American traditional songs. For example, the phrase &quot;girl with the blue dress on&quot; is documented in a Black muledriver&#x27;s song and in a popular minstrel song, as well as in a few shanties, for example,
&lt;poem&gt;
O wake her, O shake her,
O shake that girl with the blue dress on,
O Johnny come to Hilo;
Poor old man.&lt;/poem&gt;

As evident from the last lyric, above, shanty lyrics were not limited to seafaring or work topics. Drawing lyrics (and sometimes entire songs) from the popular and traditional repertoires of the time meant that a wide range of themes were represented.

===Sources===
Shanties reflect a variety of source material. As discussed above, there is a notable correspondence between shanties and African-American songs of both work and leisure. Popular music of the time was readily adapted, especially the minstrel music genre, songs of whose couplets were often of a suitable metrical length. It is common to find phrases from minstrel songs of the late 1830s and 1840s in many shanties, like &quot;A Long Time Ago&quot;, &quot;Jamboree&quot;, &quot;Johnny Come Down to Hilo&quot;, or &quot;Johnny Bowker&quot;. Music hall songs also had an influence, for example &quot;Paddy on the Railway&quot;. Popular marches were borrowed especially for capstan work, including &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; and &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;. A few shanties have ballad forms, such as &quot;The Dreadnaught&quot;, &quot;The Banks of Newfoundland&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Vanitee&quot;, but these were relatively uncommon and required the addition of a chorus section. However, shantymen more often adapted lyrics and themes from ballads and &quot;spliced&quot; them to existing shanty melodies and choruses. Other shanties were adapted from land-based traditional songs, for example &quot;Billy Boy&quot; and &quot;The Derby Ram&quot;.

==Types==
Broadly speaking, the categories for shanties can be understood in terms of whether the task(s) for which they were used was/were related to &quot;hauling&quot; or &quot;heaving&quot;. &quot;Hauling&quot; (pulling) actions were intermittent in nature. They required a coordinated show of focused exertion, not sustained, but rather at specific moments. Shanties for hauling tasks thus coordinated the timing of those exertions, the &quot;pulls&quot;. &quot;Heaving&quot; (pushing) actions were of a continuous nature. In these, coordination was of minor importance as compared to &quot;pacing&quot;. Rather than rhythmically &quot;timing&quot; the labor, shanties for heaving were more intended to set an appropriate, manageable pace and to occupy or inspire workers throughout the duration of what could often be long tasks.

===Types related to hauling actions===

; Long-drag shanty
:Also called a &quot;halyard shanty&quot;. Sung with the job of hauling on halyards to hoist, over an extended period, topsail or topgallant yards. Usually there are two pulls per chorus as in &quot;&quot;Way&quot;, hey, &quot;Blow&quot; the man down!&quot; Examples: &quot;Hanging Johnny&quot;, &quot;Whiskey Johnny&quot;, &quot;A Long Time Ago&quot;, and &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;.
:* Sample: &quot;Hurrah for the Black Ball Line&quot; (video), led by Peter Kasin on the ship &quot;Joseph Conrad&quot; at the Mystic Sea Music Festival, 2010.
;Short-drag shanty
: Also called a &quot;[fore/main]sheet shanty&quot;. Sung for short hauling jobs requiring a few bursts of great force, such as changing direction of sails via lines called braces, or hauling taut the corners of sails with sheets or tacks. These are characterized by one strong pull per chorus, typically on the last word, as in &quot;Way, haul away, haul away &quot;Joe&quot;&#x27;!&quot; Examples: &quot;Boney&quot;, &quot;Haul on the Bowline&quot;, and &quot;Haul Away Joe&quot;.
:* Sample: &quot;Haul Away Joe&quot; (audio), sung by A. Wilkins, Eastern U.S., ca. 1930–32. From the U.S. Library of Congress, R. W. Gordon Collection.
; Sweating-up chant
: Also called a &quot;swaying off chant. Sung for very brief hauling tasks, as for a few sharp pulls or &quot;swigs&quot; on a halyard to gain maximum tautness of a sail. These short chants are often classed as &quot;sing-outs&quot;, but their form differs little from sheet shanties. Examples include mostly chants that have not gone under any well-known name, along with the better known &quot;Johnny Bowker&quot; and other short-drag shanties.
:* Sample: &quot;Haul the Woodpile Down&quot; (audio) sung by unnamed sailor in San Francisco Bay area, early 1920s. From the U.S. Library of Congress, R. W. Gordon Collection.
; Hand over hand shanty
: Used for lighter hauling tasks, such as setting staysails and jibs or when simply hauling in the slack of a rope. The action is that of tugging alternately with each hand, on each beat.
:* Sample: A recreation of a hand over hand chant (video), from notation by Doerflinger (1951) of Capt. James P. Barker&#x27;s singing.
; Bunt shanty
: Used for &quot;bousing up&quot; (i.e. hauling) a bunt—the tightly bunched bundle of a sail that would need to be gathered up and fastened to the yard when furling. &quot;Paddy Doyle&#x27;s Boots&quot; is universally attested as one of the few, exclusive bunt shanties. However, &quot;Saint Helena Soldier&quot; and &quot;Johnny Bowker&quot; have also been noted.
; Stamp and go shanty
: Also called a &quot;runaway&quot; or &quot;walk away&quot; shanty. Although technically a hauling action, the work accompanied by this type of shanty was continuous in nature. Thus the songs had longer choruses, similar to heaving shanties. The work entailed many hands taking hold of a line with their backs to the &quot;fall&quot; (where the line reaches the deck from aloft) and marching away with it along the deck. On vessels of war, the drum and fife or boatswain&#x27;s whistle furnish the necessary movement regulator. There, where the strength of one or two hundred men can be applied to one and the same effort, the labor is not intermittent, but continuous. The men form on either side of the rope to be hauled, and walk away with it like firemen marching with their engine. When the headmost pair bring up at the stern or bow, they part, and the two streams flow back to the starting-point, outside the following files. Thus in this perpetual &quot;follow-my-leader&quot; way the work is done, with more precision and steadiness than in the merchant-service. As this maneuver could only be used on ships with large crews, such as vessels of war—in which few shanties were sung—shanties to accompany it were few in number and were not often noted in context. The most commonly cited example is &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot;, which is thought to be one of the few shanties allowed in the Royal Navy.

===Types related to heaving actions===
: Raising the anchor on a ship involved winding its rope around a capstan, a sort of giant winch, turned by sailors heaving wooden bars while walking around it. Other heavy tasks might also be assisted by using a capstan. Being a continuous action, shanties sung to accompany these tasks might have longer solo verses and, frequently, a &quot;grand chorus&quot;, in addition to the call-and-response form. Examples: &quot;Santianna&quot;, &quot;Paddy Lay Back&quot;, &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, &quot;Clear the Track, Let the Bulgine Run&quot;, &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, and &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;.
:* Sample: Roll the Old Chariot Along (audio) sung by unnamed sailor in San Francisco Bay area, early 1920s. From the U.S. Library of Congress, R. W. Gordon Collection.
; Windlass shanty
: Modern shanties were used to accompany work at the patent windlass, which was designed to raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as halyard shanties. And yet, the continuous nature of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while halyard shanties and capstan shanties tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass shanties sometimes shared repertoire with each of those other types. Examples: &quot;Sally Brown&quot;, &quot;Heave Away, My Johnnies&quot;, and &quot;Mister Stormalong&quot;.
:* Sample: &quot;Sally Brown&quot; (video), led by Gibb Schreffler on the barkentine &quot;Gazela&quot;, 2022.
; Pump shanty

: Because of leakage of water into the holds of wooden ships, they had to be regularly pumped out. The frequency and monotony of this task inspired the singing of many shanties. One design of pump worked very similarly to the brake windlass, while another, the Downton pump, was turned by handles attached to large wheels. Examples: &quot;Strike the Bell&quot;, &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, &quot;South Australia&quot;, and &quot;One More Day&quot;. An example of special note is &quot;Leave Her, Johnny, Leave Her&quot; (also known as &quot;Time for Us to Leave Her&quot;), which was generally sung during the last round of pumping the ship dry once it was tied up in port, prior to the crew leaving the ship at the end of the voyage.

===Other types===
; Miscellaneous deep-water shanties
: Shanties might come into play for miscellaneous additional shipboard tasks. For example, songs used to accompany the work of holystoning the deck have been attested. &quot;Poor Old Man&quot; (also known as &quot;Poor Old Horse&quot; or &quot;The Dead Horse&quot;) was sung in a ritual fashion once the sailors had worked off their advance pay (the so-called &quot;dead horse&quot;) a month into the voyage. The ceremony involved hauling a stuffed facsimile of a horse up to the yardarm, before letting it drop into the sea, all the while singing this customary shanty.
; Coastwise and longshore shanties
: Shanties have also been well-documented in use for tasks other than those of the deep-water sailor. The working of cargo was performed by stevedores to the accompaniment of shanties, for example in the tradition of the Georgia Sea Island Singers of St. Simons Island, Georgia. They used such shanties as &quot;Knock a Man Down&quot; (a variation of &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;) to load heavy timber. The category of &quot;menhaden chanties&quot; refers to work songs used on menhaden fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of menhaden chanties differ significantly from the deep-water shanties, most noticeably in the fact that the workers &quot;pull&quot; &quot;in between&quot; rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are &quot;The Johnson Girls&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t You Help Me to Raise &#x27;Em Boys&quot;. Off-shore whalermen in parts of the Caribbean sang shanties whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.
:* Sample: A menhaden chantey, &quot;Won&#x27;t You Help Me to Raise Um&quot; (video), performed by The Northern Neck Chantey Singers of Virginia.
:* Sample: A demonstration of whaleboat shanties (video), by The Barrouallie Whalers of St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines.

The above categories, with respect to the repertoire they contain, are not absolute. Sailors often took a song from one category and, with necessary alterations to the rhythm, tempo, or form, used it for a different task. This can be seen in the frequent lack of consensus, among different writers and informants, as to what job a given shanty was used for.

==&quot;Shanties&quot; versus &quot;sea songs&quot;==

Shanties are work songs and were originally sung only for work. However, sailors also sang for pleasure in the forecastle where they slept or, in fine weather, gathered near the fore bitts (large posts on the foredeck). While songs with maritime themes were sung, all manner of popular songs and ballads on any subject might be sung off watch. The leisure songs associated with sailors are labeled simply as &quot;sea songs&quot;, but they have no consistent formal characteristics. They are also popularly known among enthusiasts, especially when distinguishing them from shanties, as &quot;fo&#x27;c&#x27;s&#x27;le songs&quot; or &quot;forebitters&quot;. Although those terms were not in great evidence in the 19th century, some literary references to &quot;fore-bitter&quot; and, less so, &quot;fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle song&quot;, attest to their use even prior to the appearance of &quot;shanty&quot;. Unlike shanties, during the singing of which one&#x27;s hands were occupied, sea songs might be sung to the accompaniment of handy instruments like fiddle or concertina.

Examples of sea songs include &quot;Spanish Ladies&quot;, first popular in the Royal Navy, and &quot;The Stately Southerner&quot;, a ballad about a U.S. war ship. Examples of sea songs that were poorly documented in the sailing era, but which gained great popularity among singers in the revival era, are &quot;The Leaving of Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Rolling Down to Old Maui&quot;.

==In languages other than English==
While the crews of merchant ships in which shanties were sung might have come from a wide variety of national and ethnic backgrounds and might have spoken various mother-tongues, the shanty genre was by and large an English-language phenomenon. However, non-English-language sailor work songs were also developed. They are generally of these types:
* Preexisting non-English-language songs from the popular or folk song traditions of a linguistic group, which were adapted to the shanty paradigm;
* Preexisting, original shipboard worksongs from non-English-speaking peoples, retrofitted to the definition of &quot;shanty&quot;;
* Newly created non-English-language songs, designed to fit the established shanty paradigm;
* Translations of English shanties into other languages, often preserving their English choruses.

There are notable bodies of shanty repertoire in Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, French, Breton, and Welsh, and shanties have been translated into Polish and German. The terms for shanties in these languages do not always precisely correlate with English usage. In French, &quot;chant de marin&quot; or &quot;sailor&#x27;s song&quot; is a broad category that includes both work and leisure songs. Swedish uses &quot;sjömansvisa&quot;, &quot;sailor song&quot;, as a broad category, but tends to use the borrowed &quot;shanty&quot; to denote a work song. Similarly, Norwegian uses &quot;sjømannsvise&quot; as the broad category and the borrowed term &quot;sjanti&quot; (also spelled &quot;shanty&quot;) or the native &quot;oppsang&quot; for work songs. The equivalents in German are &quot;Seemannslied&quot; and, again, shanty. Polish uses a word derived from English: &quot;szanta&quot;.

Substantial collections of non-English shanties include the following, which have been instrumental in forming the modern day sailor song repertoires of revival performers in their respective languages:

;French:
:Hayet, Capt. Armand: &quot;Chansons de Bord&quot;. Paris: Editions Eos (1927).
;German:
:Baltzer, R. and Klaus Prigge. &quot;&quot;Knurrhahn&quot;: Sammlung deutscher und englischer Seemannslieder und Shanties wie sie auf deutschen Segelschiffen gesungen wurden&quot;. Vol. 1, 2. Kiel: A. C. Ehlers (1935–6).
;Norwegian:
:Brochmann, H. &quot;Opsang fra Seilskibstiden&quot;. Christiania: Norske Förlags Kompani Ltd. (1916).
;Swedish:
:Sternvall, Sigurd. &quot;Sång under Segel&quot;. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers Förlag (1935).

==Performance today==
Historically, shanties were usually not sung outside of work contexts, and singing sea songs was generally the purview of sailors. However, since their revival as leisure songs among laypersons they have been performed in a variety of contexts. Similarly to Euro-American folk music, shanties and sea songs are performed both informally by amateurs and as commercial entertainment by professionals, with many performers straddling both contexts. Some performers focus on shanties, sea songs, and related material, as part of the genre of maritime music, whereas in other cases performers of popular music (including the Folk genre) and classical music bring songs from the shanty repertoire into their own.

===Regional trends===
Devoted performances of shanties display certain customs and general trends in different areas. However, the genre is an international one; practices vary freely and are not limited to the following generalizations.

====North America====
In North America, enthusiasts could gather at regularly scheduled, open singing sessions, for example the &quot;chantey sings&quot; held monthly aboard the ship &quot;Balclutha&quot; in San Francisco, weekly in Gloucester, Massachusetts, At these sessions, any participant is free to start up and lead a shanty, which the rest of those present—sometimes over one hundred or more participants—join on the choruses. The gatherings aim for an inclusive atmosphere that welcomes people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and singing abilities. North American professionals often perform solo or in very small groups, frequently using instruments. One of America&#x27;s oldest inns, The Griswold Inn in Essex, Connecticut, has hosted Monday evening sea chantey sessions since 1972, originally led by Cliff Haslam and later joined by other musicians as The Jovial Crew.

Annual maritime festivals in coastal towns provide a gathering point for both amateurs and professionals, and the site for the introduction of new interpretations.

====United Kingdom====
In the UK, shanties find a venue in pubs that host &quot;folk clubs&quot;. Professional performers tend to be in larger groups with a more substantial chorus, allowing for &quot;a capella&quot; performances. They are frequently identified with a specific port town to which they belong. Many annual maritime festivals in Britain and across the Channel provide contexts for performance.

====Continental Europe====

s (German , Dutch ) are choral groups – often with many members – that perform only sailor songs. They are especially popular in the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway. Polish performers of shanties favor medium-sized groups, often singing in harmony, accompanying themselves on instruments, and presenting themselves similarly to the way a rock band would.

====Australia====

Sea Shanty Groups are active across Australia including Perth, Fremantle, and Albany. A group called The Anchormen formed by Matthew Wearne and Colin Anker in 2018, perform regular gigs in Bunbury, Western Australia. They performed at the City of Albany Maritime Festival in 2021. Anker said regarding Mental Health &quot;We&#x27;ve had guys in the group say this is the only place where they feel comfortable in that no one judges them. We often face and perform to each other instead of the audience. It&#x27;s a brotherhood. When you start singing sea shanties, it just grabs you and draws you in. You can&#x27;t stop listening to and singing them.&quot; A favourite song is Spanish Ladies.

===Shanties borrowed by other genres===

Items from the shanty and sea song repertoire have been brought into the repertoires of performers of folk music, rock, country, and Western classical music. Sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers. The forms these performers produce tend to be quite standardized and relate to their source material similar to the way a cover song does. This can be contrasted with the method of performers focusing on maritime music, who tend to think of themselves as operating within that genre or a tradition, and who develop their repertoire from multiple sources and through various experiences.

====Folk====
The folk revival movement is one in which shanties themselves were often revived, especially as they have been viewed as a branch of heritage traditional songs of Anglophone culture. Several of the early performers in the Folk genre performed and recorded a significant number of sailor songs. For example, Paul Clayton recorded the album &quot;Whaling and Sailing Songs from the Days of Moby Dick&quot; (Tradition Records) in 1956, and Burl Ives&#x27; &quot;Down to the Sea in Ships&quot; came out in the same year. Since at least the 1950s, certain shanties have become staples of the Folk genre. This is evidenced in the popular Folk music fake book &quot;Rise Up Singing&quot;, which includes such shanties as &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;, &quot;What Shall We Do with a Drunken Sailor&quot;, and &quot;Bound for South Australia&quot;.

====Rock====
Borrowings into Rock music have often resulted from the fluid borders between Folk and Rock performers and audiences. For example, Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Pay Me My Money Down&quot; derives from the interpretation by the Folk group The Weavers, who in turn found it among the collected shanties once traditionally performed by residents of the Georgia Sea Islands. Some Rock performers, too, have been inspired to adopt shanties as part of what they perceive to be a connection to their regional or national heritage. For example, The Pogues recorded &quot;Poor Paddy [Works on the Railway]&quot; in the arrangement of Folk group The Dubliners, ostensibly because of the Irish connection. Others have been fascinated by &quot;sea&quot; themes, including &quot;pirates&quot; and the perceived freedom, wildness, or debauchery of sailor culture.

====Classical====
Classical composers have used shanties and sea songs (or their melodies) in their works. The Australian composer Percy Grainger is a notable case. Malcolm Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Three Shanties&quot; for woodwind quintet (1943) develops motifs from &quot;Drunken Sailor&quot;, &quot;Boney Was a Warrior&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Come Down to Hilo&quot;.

===Performance styles===
Shanty performances today reflect a range of musical approaches and tastes. The purpose and parameters of shanty singing in the present era have had an influence on which shanties are sung and how.

Performers who favor a &quot;traditional&quot; style do not necessarily believe they are replicating the exact style of shanty singing of the 19th century. However, within the constraints of modern contexts, they tend to adhere to certain stylistic traits that are believed to have characterized the genre historically. These may include a loud or full voice, an emphatic, strident—even harsh—tone (as if to carry over the noise of wind and waves), and tempos and rhythms that are reasonably conducive to working. They often perform &quot;a capella&quot; or only with light instrumentation typical of sailors (e.g. concertina). In general, performances may be more &quot;rough around the edges&quot; and be of variable length to accommodate impromptu changes in verses.

A great many of the performers of shanties do so in what might be distinguished as a &quot;folk music&quot; style. They tend to be more interested in the songs themselves and less in the &quot;shanty style&quot; of performance, in favor of music that may be considered more pleasant, less rough, and with more variation and interest than traditional shanties offer. Stylistic characteristics include lighter vocals with a &quot;folk&quot; timbre, livelier tempos, and instrumental interludes between verses. Invariably these performers choose to accompany themselves on instruments such as guitar and banjo. Their rhythms may be syncopated and quite different from work song rhythms, relying on the instruments to keep time rather than the voice.

Still other performers come to shanties from backgrounds in pop, rock, or theatrical music, and perform in what may be called a &quot;contemporary&quot; style. Some of the preferred characteristics are smooth, pop-style vocal timbre, carefully worked out harmony, and engaging rhythms.

Less commonly—though it was the case with their earliest commercial recordings—shanties are performed in a &quot;classical&quot; choir style. Choirs like the Robert Shaw Chorale, the Norman Luboff Choir, and The Seafarers Chorus have released entire albums of shanties and sea songs.

==In popular media==
Appearances of shanties, or songs and melodies labeled as &quot;shanties&quot;, in popular media can be anachronistic and fanciful. In accord with popular perception of shanties as a genre many hundreds of years old, songs with documented existence to only the mid-19th century, at the earliest, have been freely used to portray scenes from the 18th century and earlier. By imagining modern shanties to have been in use during such eras as the Golden Age of Piracy and the Napoleonic Wars, anachronistic associations have been formed between shanties and &quot;pirates&quot;. Evidence for all these uses and associations can be found in the examples that follow in this section. Shanties, and short videos of them being sung, saw a spike in popularity in late 2020 into early 2021 mainly due to a trend on TikTok.

===Popular literature===
Much of the available historical information on shanties comes from travelogue literature, most of it of scarcely notable popularity, but some of it reaching a wide audience, such as Dana&#x27;s &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; (1840). However, some fiction writers up through the mid-19th century, who had sailing experience, also included scenes involving sailors&#x27; work songs. Among these authors were Horace Elisha Scudder, Elijah Kellogg, and Herman Melville. In &quot;Redburn: His First Voyage&quot;, for example, Melville wrote:

I soon got used to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one happened to strike up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, did not seem to be getting forward very well, the mate would always say, &quot;Come, men, can&#x27;t any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead.&quot; And then some one of them would begin, and if every man&#x27;s arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.

The shanty genre was unfamiliar to much of the lay public until it was publicized in the 1880s, however, so most of the popular references in fiction do not begin until that decade. A well-known early example, though not strictly speaking a reference to a shanty, is the song &quot;Fifteen men on the dead man&#x27;s chest&quot;, which was invented by Robert Louis Stevenson for his novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883). Quotes of &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot; were particularly plentiful. Rudyard Kipling romanticized the idea of the sailor&#x27;s sea song within the poetic genre with his works &quot;The First Chantey&quot; and &quot;The Last Chantey&quot; (1893).

===Popular music===
While shanties were historically understood as work songs, the word &quot;shanty&quot; has often been used in popular culture since the mid-20th century as a catch-all term that also includes songs supposed to have been sung during leisure time at sea, and even other songs about the sea or which vaguely inspire thoughts of the sea. Much of the historical shanty repertoire, being by definition designed to suit work, is less attractive as entertainment listening. The musical forms were highly repetitive, and the lyrics were quite often doggerel without any cohesive or preconceived composition. For these reasons, sea songs that were never or only exceptionally adapted as shanties—but which have engaging melodies and texts—have proved popular to 20th century audiences under the rubric of &quot;shanties&quot;. Both these non-shanty sailor songs and the historical repertoire of shanties are typically performed with instrumental accompaniment—something that was rare or unheard of at sea in the case of authentic shanties.

====Popular musical interpretations of traditional repertoire====
Music performers with no strong links to maritime music have interpreted traditional shanty and sea song compositions, of which widely scattered instances abound. For example, the bawdy sea song &quot;Frigging in the Rigging&quot; was recorded by the punk band Sex Pistols. Perhaps under the influence of Irish folk revival groups like The Clancy Brothers and The Dubliners, who included some shanties in their repertoires, some association has also been formed between shanties and Irish music. And so, looking back to these performers, later Irish-oriented rock groups like The Pogues interpreted traditional shanties and sea songs like &quot;South Australia&quot; and &quot;The Greenland Whale Fisheries&quot;. A notable instance where many non-maritime music performers tackled the traditional maritime repertoire stems from the actor Johnny Depp&#x27;s reported interest in shanties that developed while filming &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;. As a result, in 2006 Depp helped facilitate &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys.&quot; A medley of sea songs performed by concert orchestra, Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s Fantasia on British Sea Songs, is a popular component of the Last Night of the Proms in Britain. In 2021, sea shanties trended on TikTok after a viral rendition of the sea-themed song &quot;Wellerman&quot;, performed by Scotland-based postman Nathan Evans and popularly mistaken to be a shanty, inspired users to seek and perform songs in the genre.

====New compositions in &quot;shanty&quot; style====
The musical &quot;style&quot; of shanties has also inspired new musical compositions, ranging from those designed to imitate 19th century song-style to those merely intended to evoke seafaring culture through evocative phrases and token musical features. For example, the Stan Rogers song, &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot;, being sung in a traditional style and having lyrics that relate an anecdote of maritime history, makes a convincing sea ballad and has been adopted into the repertoire of maritime music performers. Another newly composed song by folk singer Steve Goodman, &quot;Lincoln Park Pirates&quot;, uses the phrase, &quot;Way, hey, tow &#x27;em away&quot;, imitating shanty choruses while at the same time anachronistically evoking the &quot;piracy&quot; in its subject. The theme song for the television show SpongeBob SquarePants has a shanty-like call and response structure and begins with a melodic phrase that matches the traditional &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;, presumably because the character &quot;lives in a pineapple under the sea.&quot; The theme to Gilligan&#x27;s Island was also inspired by shanty structure and style. An example of a more tenuous link between a new composition labeled as &quot;shanty&quot; and the salient characteristics of the genre, The Pogues recorded a song called &quot;Sea Shanty&quot;. The only characteristic it appears to share with the shanty genre is a 6/8 meter (displayed by some well known shanties like &quot;Blow the Man Down&quot;).

English composer Michael Maybrick (alias Stephen Adams) sold a hundred thousand copies of an 1876 song &quot;Nancy Lee&quot; in Seafaring style, with lyrics by Frederick Weatherly concerning an archetypal sailors wife. The song evoked an 1882 response Susie Bell from Australian composer Frederick Augustus Packer in the far flung British colony at Port Arthur, South Australia.

===In film and television===
Songs from the shanty repertoire have appeared in motion pictures. These most often are not portrayed in an appropriate work context and sometimes not even a shipboard context, and many times they can be classed as anachronisms that serve to bring color and interest to the drama. The following is a sample list of notable films to have included traditional shanty repertoire.

* In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Rogue&quot; – set during the Seven Years&#x27; War – sea shanties are available when on the player character, Assassin turned Templar Shay Patrick Cormac&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Morrigan&quot;. Some are immediately available, while others must be collected.
* In &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; the character Simon Pearson, a former sailor, will sing the sea shanty &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; at the campsite while playing a concertina.
* In &quot;Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire&quot;, if the player&#x27;s ship crew have a high morale score, sea shanties will be played while the player travels around the game&#x27;s overworld. These sea shanties are all based on real-world sea shanties, with the lyrics altered to add references to characters, locations and events within the game&#x27;s fictional universe (the game&#x27;s developers, Obsidian Entertainment, did something similar with cowboy songs in &quot;&quot;):
** &quot;Aim&#x27;Spirente&quot;, based on &quot;Santianna&quot;

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 with the song &quot;The Bad Old Days&quot;, written by Stephanie de Sykes and Stuart Slater, and performed by the band Co-Co. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1978&quot; ===
The national final was held on Friday 31 March 1978 at the Royal Albert Hall, presented by Terry Wogan. The songs were backed by the Alyn Ainsworth Orchestra.

Fourteen regional juries voted on the songs: Bristol, Bangor, Leeds, Norwich, Newcastle, Aberdeen, Birmingham, Manchester, Belfast, Cardiff, Plymouth, Glasgow, Southampton, and London. Each jury voted internally and ranked the songs 1–12, awarding 12 points for their highest scoring song, down to 1 point for the lowest scoring entry.

&quot;The Bad Old Days&quot; won the national and came 11th in the contest. Broadcast on Good Friday, a national holiday in the United Kingdom, &quot;A Song for Europe 1978&quot; was watched by 13.7 million viewers and was the 16th-most watched programme of the week – the show&#x27;s highest ever rating.

Both groups Co-Co and Sunshine had participated in &#x27;, albeit with different line-ups. Co-Co would return to &#x27; with another line-up, under the name The Main Event. Co-Co&#x27;s member Cheryl Baker would eventually win the Eurovision Song Contest 1981 with the group Bucks Fizz.

<doc id="311647" wikidata="Q225469" url="?curid=311647" title="Puyallup Tribe of Indians">
<text>The Puyallup Tribe of Indians ( ; ; commonly known as the Puyallup Tribe) is a federally-recognized tribe of Puyallup people from western Washington state, United States. The tribe is primarily located on the Puyallup Indian Reservation, although they also control off-reservation trust lands.

The Puyallup Tribe was established in 1936 after the Indian Reorganization Act, although the reservation was established in 1854 in the Treaty of Medicine Creek. Currently, the tribe has approximately 4,000 citizens. Its membership is descended from the aboriginal Puyallup peoples, as well as other non-Puyallup peoples who were moved to the reservation. Other Puyallup citizens are descendants of other tribes. The population of Puyallup citizens who reside on the reservation is 2,500, which is 3.2% of the reservation&#x27;s 41,000 total population.

The tribe&#x27;s government is enshrined in its constitution, and is composed of an elected government, the Puyallup Tribal Council, and the three tribal courts: the Puyallup Tribal Court, the Puyallup Tribal Court of Appeals, and the Puyallup Tribal Children&#x27;s Court. The laws of the Puyallup Tribe defined the authority of the courts as separate and equal to the Tribal Council.

==Government==
In 1936 the Puyallup Tribe was officially formed under the Indian Reorganization Act, which authorized reservation tribes to create their own governments. The tribe wrote a constitution, which created an elected government (the Tribal Council), and created a Tribal Court for certain level of issues among its citizens.

The Tribe has two branches of government, the legislative and executive Tribal Council, and the judiciary, the Tribal Courts. Both branches of government are co-equal in the government of the Puyallup Tribe.

===Tribal Council===
The primary governing body of the Puyallup Tribe is the Tribal Council (). The council is an elected body of seven members who oversee the operation of the tribe and its programs. The Tribal Council is the voice of the Puyallup Tribe, and frequently makes statements on topics ranging from tribal law, environmental protection, to civil rights activism.

Originally, the council was composed of five members. In 1991, the council was increased from five to seven members. The tribal council currently has seven members as of February 2024:

* Chairman: Bill Sterud
* Vice Chairwoman: Sylvia Miller
* Annette Bryan
* James Rideout
* Anna Bean
* Monica Miller
* Fred Dillon

===Tribal Courts===
In addition to the Tribal Council, the Puyallup Tribe also has a tribal court system. The tribe operates three separate courtthe Puyallup Tribal Court, the Puyallup Tribal Court of Appeals, and the Puyallup Tribal Children&#x27;s Courtwhich together operate the judicial branch of the government of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians. All three courts operate in the same facility.

==Economic development==

Initially the federal government wanted Native Americans to develop the family farms then typical of European Americans. This was not a concept that the Puyallup were comfortable adopting. They remained deeply involved in fishing, which constituted such an important part of their culture that it is surrounded by ritual and spirituality.

With economic and social changes in the 20th and 21st centuries, the tribe needed to develop other sources of employment and income than farming for its people. In the 20th century, the tribe generated income through cigarette sales. They could sell them at a lower price and tax-free to non-Natives, as their reservation is sovereign territory and they need not pay state taxes from their businesses. In recent years, the tribe signed an agreement with the State of Washington to sell cigarettes with taxes paid. The tribe and the state have a sharing of tax revenue collected from sales of cigarettes.

===Casino history===
Since the late 20th century, numerous states have used gambling, based on lotteries and other methods, as a source of revenue to support programs wanted by taxpayers. Changes in federal law and negotiations with such states have enabled federally recognized tribes on many reservations to establish bingo and other gambling facilities to generate revenue.

Searching for new revenues and employment for its people, the Puyallup opened the Emerald Queen Casino in 1996 on a paddlewheel riverboat, the &quot;Emerald Queen&quot;, which it berthed in the Port of Tacoma. The riverboat was acquired for $15 million and could accommodate 2,000 people. In 2004, as part of an agreement with the Port to accommodate further commercial development of the waterway, the tribe closed the operation on the boat and its shore-side property. The unused &quot;Emerald Queen&quot; riverboat remained docked in Tacoma until 2023, when it was sold to a barge operator based in Seattle.

The tribe has developed related gaming and entertainment facilities in two other locations, keeping the name Emerald Queen Casino for its overall operation. In the 21st century, a majority of the tribe&#x27;s income is generated from the gambling casinos and related restaurant, retail and hotel facilities.

In total area, the casino is one of the largest casinos in Washington state. It has locations in both Tacoma and Fife. The Tacoma location, includes the casino, a restaurant and buffet and an entertainment venue hosting singers and comedians. The entertainment venue, in collaboration with Brian Halquist Productions, Inc., is host to the Battle at the Boat boxing series, which is the longest-running casino boxing series in the Pacific Northwest. A majority of the casino is located in a new 310,000 sq ft multi-level structure, which opened in June 2020; also includes a hotel and parking garage. The original I-5 location was intended as a temporary facility, and closed permanently in May 2020. It has continued to be used pending other development. The permanent structure of the old casino is located in the old Puyallup Bingo Hall. The I-5 location opened originally in 2001, and the tent addition was opened in 2004.

The Fife location includes a casino and a 140-room hotel. The tribe adapted a Best Western hotel for these purposes after purchasing the building in 2004. After renovation, the casino was opened in early 2005. The tribe undertook a major expansion in summer 2007, building two parking garages, a pool, a spa, new administrative towers, a ballroom, and a larger gaming area. The casino&#x27;s restaurant, formerly named the Pacific Rim, was moved to the south tower and renamed the Tatoosh Grill. What is now the Pacific Rim Buffet is located on the ground floor of the tower.

A new building for the Tacoma location was opened on June 8, 2020, following a $400 million expansion project. The facility near I-5 has five restaurants and a 12-story, 170-room hotel. The project also includes an events center with capacity for 2,000 people.

===Other ventures===
The Puyallup Tribe has used its economic development branch, Marine View Ventures, to expand into operating several gas stations on the reservation. In the early 21st century, it was using gambling revenues to invest in a partnership for a large container facility at the Port of Tacoma. When completed, it will be the largest such facility in the Northwest and will connect the tribe to the shipping trade.

The Puyallup Tribe has also invested in the state&#x27;s legal cannabis market. The tribe&#x27;s first recreational cannabis store, Commencement Bay Cannabis, is located in Fife, adjacent to the casino itself.

==Reservation==

The Puyallup Indian Reservation is the reservation of the Puyallup Tribe, located in parts of Pierce and King counties of Washington state. The reservation, located at , is mostly located in Pierce County, although a small part is located in the city of Federal Way, which is in King County. The reservation has a land area of 73.935 km2 (28.547 sq mi) and has a population of 41,341, approximately 2,500 of which (3.2%) are Puyallup citizens. The majority of people living on the reservation are non-Indian, with 72 percent identifying only as Caucasian. Pierce County itself has a large Native American population of 32,000.

The largest city on the reservation is Tacoma, which covers a portion and has a population of 219,346 . Other communities on the reservation include Waller, Fife, Milton, Edgewood, Puyallup, and Federal Way.

Due to land sales at a time when land was distributed to householders and other developments, neighboring jurisdictions have territory within the reservation. The city of Fife, Washington and the unincorporated community of Fife Heights, Washington lies entirely within the reservation as does much of the Port of Tacoma. The total population within the reservation is predominantly non-Native and not tribal members, according to the 2000 census.

From the mid-nineteenth century, European Americans began to enter the area in greater numbers. The United States wanted to enable development of lands and settlement by these people. Under the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, The United States arranged with the Puyallup and several other tribes the cession of land to the U.S. and the removal of the Native population to reservations. Initially, the reservations were intended to be only occupied by Indians, and not settlers. While the tribe lost most of its historic territory, it retained rights for fishing, hunting and gathering on that land. The Puyallup and United States had such different conceptions of property that they did not fully understand each other&#x27;s position. 

In 1989–1990, the Port of Tacoma and the Puyallup Tribe reached a $163 million settlement, enabled by the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989. It became one of the largest 20th century Indian land claims settlements.

==Language==

The language of the Puyallup Tribe is Lushootseed, a Coast Salish language spoken by many different peoples in the Puget Sound region. Lushootseed is split into two major dialects, Northern and Southern Lushootseed. The Puyallup speak Southern Lushootseed, often also known as Twulshootseed (from , the Puyallup name for Lushootseed). Lushootseed was a historically oral language, and was only written in the modern era. The alphabet was created by Lushootseed-speaking elders working with linguist Thom Hess in the 1960s.

The language has declined in recent years, with the last fluent speaker, Vi Hilbert, dying in 2008. However, many tribes, including the Puyallup Tribe, are working to revitalize the language in daily use. The Puyallup Tribe has a strong language department, the Puyallup Language Program, which was created to revitalize Twulshootseed, emphasizing using the language for communication. The main objectives of the program are to create &quot;language nests,&quot; physical locations where only Twulshootseed, not English, is spoken; to help individuals create their own language learning program, without needing to rely on one centralized language program, and to grow the Twulshootseed language in the school, the home, the workplace, and the community.

The Puyallup Language Program operates a website, Puyallup Tribal Language, where they offer free resources for learning the language, information about the language and their program, and classes for tribal members.

<doc id="311649" wikidata="Q19795" url="?curid=311649" title="Stevenage">
<text>Stevenage ( ) is a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about north of London. Stevenage is east of junctions 7 and 8 of the A1(M), between Letchworth Garden City to the north and Welwyn Garden City to the south. In 1946, Stevenage was designated the United Kingdom&#x27;s first New Town under the New Towns Act.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Stevenage&quot; may derive from Old English &quot;stiþen āc&quot; / &quot;stiðen āc&quot; / &quot;stithen ac&quot; (various Old English dialects cited here) meaning &quot;(place at) the stiff oak&quot;.

The name was recorded as &quot;Stithenæce&quot; in 1060 and as &quot;Stigenace&quot; in the Domesday Book in 1086.

==History==
===Pre-Conquest===
Stevenage lies near the line of the Roman road from Verulamium to Baldock. Some Romano-British remains were discovered during the building of the New Town, and a hoard of 2,000 silver Roman coins was discovered during housebuilding in the Chells Manor area in 1986. Other artefacts included a dodecahedron toy, fragments of amphorae for imported wine, bone hairpins, and samian ware pottery associated with high status families. Archeological excavations have confirmed the existence of a small Roman farmstead, a malting kiln and a Celtic round house in the Chells area, and a cemetery containing 25 cremations. The most substantial evidence of activity from Roman times is Six Hills, six tumuli by the side of the old Great North Road that are presumably the burial places of members of a local family.

The first Saxon camp, a little to the east of the Roman sites, was in a clearing in the woods where the church, the manor house and the first village were later built. Settlements also sprang up in Chells, Broadwater and Shephall. Before the New Town was established, Shephall was a separate parish, and Broadwater was split between the parishes of Shephall and Knebworth.

During the 9th and 10th centuries AD, the Saxon village in Stevenage faced frequent attacks from Viking raiders. Stevenage was on the border of the Danelaw. A Viking spearhead was discovered by archaeologists at nearby Ardeley.

===Middle Ages===
According to the Domesday Book, in 1086 the Lord of the Manor was the Abbot of Westminster Abbey. The settlement had moved down to the Great North Road. In 1281 it was granted a Royal Charter to hold a weekly market and annual fair, still held in the High Street.

The earliest part of St Nicholas&#x27;s Church dates from the 12th century, but it was probably a site of worship much earlier. The list of rectors (parish priests) is relatively complete from 1213. Around 1500 the church was much improved, with decorative woodwork and the addition of a clerestory.

North of the Old Town is Jack&#x27;s Hill, associated with the legendary archer Jack O&#x27;Legs of Weston. According to local folklore, Jack stole flour from the bakers of Baldock to feed the poor during a famine, like Robin Hood.

The remains of a medieval moated homestead in Whomerley Wood comprise an 80-yard-square trench almost five feet wide in parts. It was probably the home of Ralph de Homle. Pieces of Roman and later pottery have been found there.

The oldest surviving house in Stevenage is Tudor House in Letchmore Street, built before 1500. During the 16th century it was a butcher&#x27;s shop owned by a man named Scott. From 1773 onwards it served as the town&#x27;s workhouse, and later became a school from 1835 until 1885. It was the headquarters of the local town gas company from c.1885 until 1936, when it was converted into a private dwelling.

Chells Manor, a medieval hall house located three miles from the Old Town, was built in the 14th century for the Wake family on the foundations of a much older moated manor house mentioned in the Domesday Book. The site of the lost village of Chells was redeveloped during the extension of the New Town in the 1980s, and a hoard of Roman coins was discovered. In the present day, Chells is a suburb of New Stevenage.

===Tudor, Stuart and Georgian eras===
In 1558 Thomas Alleyne, then the Rector of Stevenage, founded a free grammar school for boys, Alleyne&#x27;s Grammar School, which, despite becoming a boys&#x27; comprehensive school in 1967 (starting with the 1969 year), had an unbroken existence (unlike the grammar school in neighbouring Hitchin) until 1989, when it was merged with Stevenage Girls&#x27; School to become the Thomas Alleyne School. Francis Cammaerts was Headmaster of Alleyne&#x27;s Grammar School from 1952 to 1961. The school, which has been since 1989 a mixed comprehensive school and is now an academy as of 2013, still exists on its original site at the north end of the High Street. It was intended to move the school to Great Ashby, but the Coalition government (2010–15) scrapped the move owing to budget cuts.

During the 17th century, the Elizabethan house at 37 High Street was the home of greengrocer and churchwarden Henry Trigg. Trigg was a philanthropist who donated another of his properties to serve as Stevenage&#x27;s first workhouse. When Henry died in 1724 his coffin was placed in the rafters of the adjoining barn to prevent resurrection men from stealing his remains. In 1774, Trigg&#x27;s house became the Old Castle coaching inn, and was used as a staging post by the Royal Mail. From 1999 until 2016 it served as a branch of NatWest, and as of 2022 it has been converted into a dentist&#x27;s surgery.

Stevenage&#x27;s prosperity came in part from the Great North Road, which was turnpiked in the early 18th century on the site of the present day Marquess of Granby pub. Many inns in the High Street served the stagecoaches, 21 of which passed through Stevenage each day in 1800. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the road now known as Six Hills Way was the haunt of highwaymen who would use the ancient burial mounds as a hiding place. James Whitney, the namesake of the Highwayman pub in Graveley, was hanged at Newgate in 1693 for robbing travellers in this area. Whitney, a Jacobite, was born in Stevenage c.1660 and was apprenticed to a butcher in Hitchin before opening an inn in Cheshunt. Due to the failure of his business, Whitney began robbing wealthy travellers and by 1690 he had a gang of over 50 men.

On 10 July 1807, the Great Fire of Stevenage destroyed 42 properties in Middle Row, including Hellard&#x27;s almshouse of 1501. The fire is believed to have been started when a young girl employed as a chambermaid at one of the coaching inns emptied embers from the fireplace into the street. Sparks from the embers ignited the thatched roof of a nearby wheelwright&#x27;s shop, and quickly engulfed the other timber framed buildings in the north end of the Old Town due to a strong North wind. The conflagration was only stopped from engulfing the entire street by demolishing a house to serve as a firebreak. After the fire was extinguished by Stevenage&#x27;s volunteer firefighters using a hand-operated fire engine made in 1763, the houses and inns were rebuilt with brick facades and tiled roofs. Troopers from the Hertfordshire Yeomanry assisted the firefighters in the operation.

===Victorian era to 20th century===

In 1850 the Great Northern Railway was constructed and the era of the stagecoach ended. Stevenage grew only slowly throughout the 19th century and a second church (Holy Trinity) was constructed at the south end of the High Street. In 1861 Dickens commented, &quot;The village street was like most other village streets: wide for its height, silent for its size, and drowsy in the dullest degree. The quietest little dwellings with the largest of window-shutters to shut up nothing as if it were the Mint or the Bank of England.&quot;

At the turn of the century, the twin poachers Albert and Ebenezer Fox were active in the area. While in jail, they were studied by police commissioner Edward Henry to confirm his theory on the usefulness of fingerprinting in forensic science.

In 1928 Philip Vincent bought the HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd out of receivership, immediately moving it to Stevenage and renaming it the Vincent HRD Motorcycle Co Ltd. He produced the legendary motorcycles, including the Black Shadow and Black Lightning, in the town until 1955.

==Stevenage New Town==


Slow growth in Stevenage continued until just after the Second World War, when the Abercrombie Plan called for the establishment of a ring of new towns around London. On 1 August 1946, Stevenage was designated the first New Town under the New Towns Act.

The plan was not popular and local people protested at a meeting held in the town hall before Lewis Silkin, minister in the Labour Government of Clement Attlee. As Lewis Silkin arrived at the railway station for this meeting, some local people had changed the signs &#x27;Stevenage&#x27; to &#x27;Silkingrad&#x27;. Silkin was obstinate at the meeting, telling a crowd of 3,000 people outside the town hall (around half the town&#x27;s residents): &quot;It&#x27;s no good your jeering, it&#x27;s going to be done.&quot; Despite the hostile reaction to Silkin and a referendum that showed 52% (turnout 2,500) &#x27;entirely against&#x27; the expansion, the plan went ahead. The first significant building to be demolished to make way for a gyratory system was the Old Town Hall, in which the opposition had been expressed, in 1974.

The inaugural chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation was the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, appointed by Lewis Silkin in 1946, with the radical town planner Dr Monica Felton as his deputy. In 1949 she became chairman but she was sacked within two years. There were a number of reasons for her dismissal by the government but a lack of hands-on town planning leadership and her opposition to the Korean War (for which she was later awarded the Lenin Peace Prize) sullied her reputation. Felton was replaced first by Allan Duff and later Thomas Bennett, who carried the project to completion. Gordon Stephenson was the planner, Peter Shepheard the architect, and Eric Claxton the engineer. Claxton took the attitude that the new town should separate bicycles from the automobile as much as possible. Mary Tabor was the Housing Director of Stevenage New Town from 1951 until 1972. Tabor was a member of the Society of Women Housing Managers, which was founded by women trained under Octavia Hill. Mary Tabor, with the support of more than 40 housing management staff by 1960, provided a notably personal and caring service to tenants of the town. Many early residents of the town would recall with gratitude how much she had done for them and the town as a whole.

In May 1953, Sir Roydon Dash took over the position of chairman from Bennett. In 1962, Sir Arthur Rucker was appointed Chairman of the Stevenage Development Corporation, retiring from the position in 1966. He was succeeded by Evelyn Denington, Baroness Denington, who joined the board in 1950. Denington remained the chairman until the dissolution of the Corporation in 1980. Having become a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1974, Denington was elevated to the peerage in 1978, choosing to assume the title of Baroness Denington of Stevenage.

In keeping with the sociological outlook of the day, the town was planned with six self-contained neighbourhoods, each to house between ten and twelve thousand people. The first two estates to be occupied were the Stoney Hall and Monks Wood &#x27;Estates&#x27;, in 1951. The &quot;Twin Foxes&quot; pub, on the Monks Wood estate, was Stevenage&#x27;s first &#x27;new&#x27; public house and was named after local notorious identical-twin poachers (Albert and Ebenezer Fox). It closed in 2017. At least two other public houses have a direct relationship to local history. The &quot;Edward the Confessor&quot; pub (closed 2006) could have had a connection to St Mary&#x27;s Church in nearby Walkern as King Edward reigned from 1042 until his death in 1066 and Walkern&#x27;s church dates from this period. The second pub with a link to local history is the &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; in Broadwater. The name of the pub is the title of a novel by Charles Dickens. Dickens was an occasional guest of Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton in nearby Knebworth House and knew Stevenage very well.

Next to be built and occupied were the neighbourhoods of Bedwell in 1952, and then came Broadwater and Shephall (1953), Chells in the 1960s and later Pin Green and Symonds Green. Another new development to the north of the town is Great Ashby. it was still under construction. The Government gave almost £2 million for a purpose-built homeless shelter, which will serve a large part of Hertfordshire.

===Industrial area===
Stevenage Development Corporation zoned an area for industry between the East Coast railway line and the A1 road, which came to be known as Gunnels Wood Industrial Area. An additional area for industry has since been developed at Pin Green.

The primary industrial area is in a location that is separate—but adjacent to—the residential areas of town. British Aerospace (now MBDA) was the largest employer in this area, but it has now been replaced by GSK. The firm occupies a large complex, hosting one of GSK&#x27;s two global R&amp;D hubs.

Airbus Defence and Space (previously British Aerospace) is located in a smaller industrial park. This is the same area that both Matra Marconi Space and Astrium, a prime contractor and equipment supplier of spacecraft, previously occupied. The site is used to assemble a number of spacecraft and rovers including &quot;Rosalind Franklin&quot; and the Solar Orbiter, and conduct analysis on others such as the Mars Earth Return Orbiter.

There are also small- to medium-sized firms such as Stevenage BioScience Catalyst (SBC), a new science park aimed at attracting small and start-up life-sciences enterprises, opened in 2011 on a site next to GSK.

===Stevenage town centre===
The pedestrianised town centre was the first purpose-built traffic-free shopping zone in Britain, taking its inspiration from the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, and was officially opened in 1959 by the Queen. A landmark in the town centre is the clock tower and ornamental pool. Nearby is &quot;Joyride&quot;, a mother and child sculpture by Franta Belsky.

Next to the Town Garden, the Church of St Andrew and St George is an example of modern church design and has housed Stevenage Museum in its crypt since 1976. The church is a Grade 2 listed building. It is also the largest parish church to have been built in England since World War Two. Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother laid the foundation stone in July 1956 and was also present at the consecration of the Bishop of St Alban&#x27;s, the Right Reverend Michael Gresford-Jones, on Advent Sunday 27 November 1960. The frame is constructed from a continuous pour of concrete into moulds, creating interlacing arches and leaving no apparent joints. There are twelve Purbeck-marble columns around the high altar and the external walls are clad in panels faced with Normandy pebble. The campanile houses the loudspeakers for an electro-acoustic carillon. A popular sculpture, &#x27;The Urban Elephant&#x27; by Andrew Burton, was commissioned in 1992.

Although revolutionary for its time, the town centre is showing signs of age and, in 2005, plans were revealed for a major regeneration to take place over the next decade. Details are still being debated by the council, landowners and other interested parties.
Multimillion-pound plans to redevelop Stevenage town centre were scrapped owing to the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the lack of interested private-sector partners. On 24 May 2012 Stevenage Borough Council announced that a £250m scheme for the shopping area has been pulled by Stevenage Regeneration Limited (SRL) because of the continuing adverse economic conditions. The plans, which included realigning streets, moving the bus station and building a new department store, cinema, hotel, restaurants, and flats, had been given council planning approval in January 2012.

===Events===
Stevenage holds a number of annual events, including Stevenage Day and Rock in the Park. In past years Stevenage Carnival has also been held, with a number of attempts to revive it. In June 2022, Stevenage Day returned to the King George Playing Fields to celebrate the platinum jubilee of Elizabeth II. It was the first carnival held in Stevenage since 2019, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2016, Stevenage &quot;celebrated&quot; its seventieth anniversary as a New Town.

===Later schemes===

The Town Centre Regeneration Strategy (2002) called for better-quality shops (including a major department store), improved public transport with a combined bus and rail interchange, high-density town-centre living, substantially improved civic facilities, increased office space and an improved &#x27;public realm&#x27;. YMCA Space Stevenage (a youth and community centre) was evicted and replaced by Paddy Power (a betting shop). Other well-known stores, such as Maplin Electronics, and Marks &amp; Spencer have also disappeared from Stevenage town centre.

The town has a large central library in Southgate, at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct, with facilities including printing, fax and photocopying, children&#x27;s events, study space, a carers&#x27; information point and a large public computer suite, as well as a small branch library at the northern end of the High Street in the Old Town. There is also a public library in nearby Knebworth, located in St Martin&#x27;s Road.

The town is still growing. It is set to expand west of the A1(M) motorway and may be further identified for development. The main area of more recent development is Great Ashby to the north-east of the town (but actually in North Hertfordshire District). A considerable amount of in-borough development has been undertaken at Chrysalis Park on the old Dixon&#x27;s Warehouse site adjacent to the Pin Green Industrial Estate.

=== Regeneration ===
The town and the Stevenage First partnership has now launched a new, £1bn, 20-year regeneration programme designed to transform central spaces and introduce new residential, commercial and retail facilities, amongst others. The programme is formed of a number of individual schemes including the £350m ‘SG1’ programme being led by Mace and the £50m redevelopment of Queensway North, the former site of Marks &amp; Spencer. In addition, Stevenage&#x27;s Town Square is also being regenerated with new bars, restaurants, flexible working facilities and shops being introduced to the area. The plans are based on the local government authority&#x27;s Local Plan which was given approval on 26 March 2019. The town is also introducing a new public services hub which will consolidate services that are currently spread across Stevenage into one central space A new Bus Interchange opened on Sunday 26 June 2022, closer to the train station, and adjacent to the Gordon Craig Theatre. A number of other developments, including the conversion of a series of commercial spaces into residential facilities, are already completed or underway with a series of additional programmes set to launch in the coming years.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Stevenage experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to almost all of the United Kingdom.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Bedwell, Bragbury End, Broadwater, Chells, Chells Manor, Pin Green, Poplars, Old Town, Shephall and Symonds Green.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Stevenage, at district and county level: Stevenage Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council.

Stevenage was an ancient parish in the hundred of Broadwater. From 1835 Stevenage was included in the Hitchin Poor Law Union. As such it became part of the Hitchin Rural Sanitary District in 1872, with local government functions passing to the Hitchin Board of Guardians. The following year the town voted to become a Local Government District governed by a Local Board, which would have the effect of also making the town an Urban Sanitary District, independent of the Hitchin Rural Sanitary District. The Stevenage Local Government District took effect on 2 October 1873, covering the whole parish of Stevenage. The first meeting of the Stevenage Local Board was held on 4 December 1873 at the recently built Town Hall on Orchard Road. The first chairman of the board was George Becher Blomfield, who was the rector of the town&#x27;s parish church of St Nicholas.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the Local Board became Stevenage Urban District Council on 31 December 1894. Stevenage Urban District was enlarged several times, notably in 1953 when it absorbed the neighbouring parish of Shephall. Until 1964 the council met at the Town Hall on Orchard Road. With the designation of the New Town, several plans for a civic centre in the new town centre were put forward, but none came to fruition. In September 1964, the council moved its offices and meeting place to a recently-built office building in the new town centre called Southgate House (later renamed Vista Tower). The old Town Hall was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for Lytton Way. The council was based at Southgate House until 1980, when it moved to Daneshill House, which had previously been the headquarters of the New Town Corporation.

The Local Government Act 1972 reconstituted Stevenage Urban District as a non-metropolitan district with effect from 1 April 1974. The town was awarded borough status on the same date and has been governed by Stevenage Borough Council since. The borough&#x27;s coat of arms consists of a shield and crest. On the shield is a sword running through an oak tree with acorns. The oak tree represents surrounding woodland and the acorns symbolise the steady growth of the town. The sword is from the Arms of the Bishops of London, former landowners. A red fesse depicts the Great North Road and upon the fesse are six stars representing the neighbourhoods of Old Stevenage, Bedwell, Broadwater, Shephall, Chells and Pin Green. The hart on the crest is from the arms of the county of Hertfordshire; one of its hooves rests upon a cogwheel, a symbol of the town&#x27;s industry. The gold crown atop a helmet represents a planned area.

==Demographics==
The population of Stevenage increased significantly during the 20th century. Little more than a large village at the start of the 19th century, the population in 1801 was 1,430. By 1901, Stevenage opened the 20th century with a population of 4,048.

After Stevenage was designated a new town under the New Towns Act of 1946, the population exploded in the 1950s and 1960s. By the start of the 21st century, the 2001 population had grown to 79,715 reaching 83,957 a decade later (2011). the population is estimated at 87,100.

==Religion==

As of the 2021 census, the religious makeup was:

==Sport and leisure==

King George&#x27;s Field, named in memory of King George V, hosts Stevenage Cricket Club, Stevenage Hockey Club and Stevenage Town Bowls Club. The cricket ground is called Ditchmore Lane. The nearby Stevenage Leisure Park has a multiplex cinema, clubs, and restaurants. The main shopping area is around Queensway and the Westgate. At the south of the town, there is a retail park called 9Yards (formerly Roaring Meg), its former name being taken from a stream (a tributary of the River Beane) that runs under it. The river can be seen along the western edge of the area. There is also shopping in the Old Town. 9Yards once had an ice rink and bowling alley, but these were demolished in 2000 to allow the construction of more stores.

Stevenage FC, formerly known as Stevenage Borough, is the town&#x27;s major football team, playing their home matches at Broadhall Way. Founded in 1976, the club were promoted to the Football Conference, the highest tier of non-league football, in 1994. After sixteen seasons in this division, Stevenage won the Conference Premier title during the 2009–10 season, having previously been denied promotion to the Football League due to insufficient ground facilities in 1996. During Stevenage&#x27;s first season as a Football League club, they secured back-to-back promotions to League One, the third tier of English football, after beating Torquay United 1–0 in the 2010–11 play-off final at Old Trafford.

Stevenage also won the FA Trophy in 2007, beating Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 53,262. It was the first competitive club game and cup final to be held at the new stadium. Stevenage reached the final again in 2009, beating York City 2–0. The club has also enjoyed several runs in the FA Cup, raising the town&#x27;s profile in the process. During the 1997–98 campaign, Stevenage held Premier League side Newcastle United to a draw at Broadhall Way, before losing the replay 2–1 at Newcastle. The club would go one better in 2010, securing a 3–1 home victory over Newcastle in the third round of the competition – the first time the club had beaten first tier opposition. The following season, Stevenage held Tottenham Hotspur to a 0–0 draw at home in the fifth round, before losing the subsequent replay 3–1 at White Hart Lane.

The town also has a number of other successful sports clubs, including a women&#x27;s football team (Stevenage Borough Ladies FC) and Stevenage Town Rugby Club. Many top class sporting heroes have come from Stevenage, including footballers Kevin Phillips and Ashley Young, seven-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, and golfer Ian Poulter.

Fairlands Valley is a large area of parkland with boating lakes. It is home to a Parkrun. The town is a very green town, with avenues of trees (typically Norway Maple) throughout but also large woods such as Monks &amp; Whomerley Wood, which is ancient semi-natural woodland. Indeed, the Woodland Trust ranks it as one of the best places in the UK for ease of access to large woodland, with 99.9% of the population having access to woodland over within , only slightly behind those living in the Forest of Dean or New Forest. There are also many playing fields (e.g. St. Nicholas playing fields near Ripon Road). The town&#x27;s schools all have a substantial amount of ground; key examples are Ashtree Primary School, Moss Bury Primary School, Longmeadow Primary School and Barnwell.

Stevenage also has a basketball team: East Herts Royals (Formerly known as Stevenage Scorpions)

The town is surrounded by the Stevenage Outer Orbital Path (STOOP), a circuit walk established by the North Herts Ramblers Group in 2008. The circuit provides an informal, active recreational leisure amenity readily available to the residents of Stevenage and the surrounding villages. The STOOP is split into several sections, accessible via a series of links from the town. The route passes through Graveley, Walkern, Beane Valley, Datchworth, Woolmer Green, Knebworth Park, St Ippolyts and Little Wymondley. It was launched on 20 September 2008.

==Culture==

A small community arts centre is located in the 9Yards Retail Park. The Boxfield and Foyer Gallery is situated in the Gordon Craig Theatre, which forms part of the large central Leisure Centre. Stevenage Museum is located under the St. Andrew and St. George&#x27;s church on St George&#x27;s Way.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and BBC London on BBC One and ITV Anglia and ITV London on ITV. Television signals are received from either the Sandy Heath or Crystal Palace transmitters.
Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio on 90.4 FM and Heart Hertfordshire on 106.7 FM.

The Comet is the town&#x27;s weekly local newspaper.

==Nearby attractions==
North of Stevenage Old Town, near St Nicholas&#x27; Church, lies Rooks&#x27; Nest (&quot;under the big wych-elm&quot;), home of the novelist E. M. Forster from 1884 to 1894. Forster used Rooksnest and the surrounding area as the setting for his novel &quot;Howards End&quot;. In the preface to one paperback edition of &quot;Howards End&quot; there is information about landmarks of Stevenage and their relationship to the story of the novel, such as Stevenage High Street and the Six Hills. The land north of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, known as Forster Country, is the last remaining farmland within the boundary of Stevenage borough. Forster was unhappy with the development of new Stevenage, which would, in his words, &quot;fall out of the blue sky like a meteorite upon the ancient and delicate scenery of Hertfordshire&quot;.

In the spring of 2023, Forster Country was threatened by housing development. 2,000 people petitioned the council to rethink plans to build a car park, landfill site and power station in the country park.

To the south of Stevenage is Knebworth House, a gothic stately home and venue of globally renowned rock concerts since 1974. The house was once home to Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Victorian English novelist and spiritualist.

Astonbury Wood, south-east of Stevenage, is a nature reserve of Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. It is ancient woodland, area .

==Transport==
A distinctive feature of Stevenage is its urban landscape. There are many roundabouts, few traffic lights, a network of completely segregated cycleways, and some of the tallest street lights in Britain. Eric Claxton was chief engineer of Stevenage from 1962 to 1972, and the comprehensive separate cycle network was planned and implemented by him during that period. Despite this network, the bicycle&#x27;s modal share is 2.7%. Claxton was also of the view that Stevenage should contain as few traffic lights as possible, hence his preference for roundabouts to regulate traffic flow. He was so adamant about roundabouts that he had a house built for himself on the gyratory system in the Old Town.

The A1(M) motorway bypasses the town to the west. Work on the 7.5-mile bypass was started on Monday 30 May 1960 at Langley Sidings, by Ernest Marples. 54 miles of dual carriageway, on the A1, had been opened, with 75 miles under construction. It would cost £1.8m, to take 19 months. The southern end started from a roundabout at the Clock restaurant near Welwyn. The bridges were built by Simon Carves of south Manchester, and the main contractor was Martin Cowley Ltd, of Clay Cross, in Derbyshire. The old Great North Road, in part classified as the B197, runs through the town and the Old Town&#x27;s High Street has several pubs that were formerly coaching inns. The A602 connects the town to Hitchin, Watton-at-Stone, Hertford and Ware.

The main bus operator is Arriva Herts &amp; Essex, which have a depot situated on Babbage Road. They run over 10 routes in and around the town, with intercity services to Luton (on the 100/101), St Albans (on the 301), Welwyn Garden City (on the 908), and Letchworth Garden City (on the 55), among others.
Another operator in the town is unō, who run the 635 between Watford and Hitchin via Stevenage, which provides discounted travel to University of Hertfordshire students. Centrebus also operate some services out of their Luton depot, including the Connect Herts branded routes 390 and 907, to Hertford and Cheshunt respectively.
Vectare, formerly Central Connect, also operate.

On Sunday 26 June 2022, the new Stevenage Interchange opened, replacing the former bus station as that land needed to be repurposed for redevelopment. The new bus station has toilets, a heated and air conditioned waiting room with a help desk, a small shop and a small café. It has 10 stands lettered A to K, skipping I. On Lytton Way, there is a coach stand, lettered L.

Currently, the only coach service to operate to Stand L is the 006 between Cambridge and London, operated by FlixBus.

Stevenage railway station on the East Coast Main Line has regular commuter services to (taking 24 minutes) and (taking 37 minutes), as well as connections to northern England and Scotland.

==Education==
Many schools were built in the 1950s/60s due to an influx of Londoners to affordable terraced housing in areas such as Shephall, Broadwater, Chells and St Nicholas. The town has around 23 primary schools (see below). Some go to the surrounding villages of Aston, Benington, Walkern, Datchworth for their schooling. Stevenage also has a number of secondary schools and the central campus for North Hertfordshire College.

==In popular culture==
Stevenage was the setting for two feature films, &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot; (1967) and &quot;Boston Kickout&quot; (1995). Stevenage was the filming location, though not the on-screen setting, for two other films, &quot;Serious Charge&quot; (1959) and &quot;Spy Game&quot; (2001), standing in as the Washington, D.C. area for the latter film. The 2009 psychological horror found footage short film and web series &quot;No Through Road&quot; by Steven Chamberlain follows four seventeen-year-old teenagers en route to Stevenage who find themselves trapped in a time loop along two road signs marking an intersection between Benington and Watton. The 2015 BBC One comedy series &quot;The Kennedys&quot; is set on an estate in New Town Stevenage. &quot;Saxondale&quot; a critically acclaimed 2007 situation comedy starring Steve Coogan as a divorcee and ex-roadie with anger management issues. 
The 2018 Channel 4 comedy series, &quot;Lee and Dean&quot;, is filmed and set in Stevenage. In one episode of UK quiz show &quot;Only Connect&quot;, one of the contestants made what could be seen as a frivolous mention of Stevenage, playfully suggesting that that could be where the literary character Mrs Malaprop comes from. Coincidentally, the title of the quiz show is taken from the E. M. Forster novel &quot;Howards End&quot;, which Forster based on a house he lived in Stevenage between 1883 and 1893.

Stevenage woman has been profiled as a crucial swing voter for the 2024 general election.

<text>Petrus Ramus (; Anglicized as Peter Ramus ; 1515 – 26 August 1572) was a French humanist, logician, and educational reformer. A Protestant convert, he was a victim of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre.

==Early life==
He was born at the village of Cuts, Picardy; his father was a farmer. He gained admission at age twelve (thus about 1527) to the Collège de Navarre, working as a servant. A reaction against scholasticism was in full tide, at a transitional time for Aristotelianism. On the occasion of receiving his M.A. degree in 1536, Ramus allegedly took as his thesis &quot;Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse&quot; (&quot;Everything that Aristotle has said is false&quot;), which Walter J. Ong paraphrases as follows:

According to Ong this kind of spectacular thesis was in fact routine at the time. Even so, Ong raises questions as to whether Ramus actually ever delivered this thesis.

==Early academic career==

Ramus, as graduate of the university, started courses of lectures. At this period he was engaged in numerous separate controversies. One opponent in 1543 was the Benedictine . He was accused, by Jacques Charpentier, professor of medicine, of undermining the foundations of philosophy and religion. Arnaud d&#x27;Ossat, a pupil and friend of Ramus, defended him against Charpentier. Ramus was made to debate Goveanus (Antonio de Gouveia), over two days. The matter was brought before the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris, and finally before Francis I. By him it was referred to a commission of five, who found Ramus guilty of having &quot;acted rashly, arrogantly and impudently,&quot; and interdicted his lectures (1544).

==Royal support==

He withdrew from Paris, but soon afterwards returned, the decree against him being canceled by Henry II, who came to the throne in 1547, through the influence of Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. He obtained a position at the Collège de Navarre.

In 1551 Henry II appointed him a regius professor at the Collège de France, but at his request he was given the unique and at the time controversial title of Professor of Philosophy and eloquence. For a considerable time he lectured before audiences numbering as many as 2,000. , another professor there, published &quot;Contra novam academiam Petri Rami oratio&quot; (1551), and called him a &quot;parricide&quot; for his attitude to Aristotle. The more serious charge was that he was a &quot;nouveau academicien&quot;, in other words a sceptic. Audomarus Talaeus (Omer Talon c.1510–1581), a close ally of Ramus, had indeed published a work in 1548 derived from Cicero&#x27;s description of Academic scepticism, the school of Arcesilaus and Carneades.

==After conversion==

In 1561 he faced significant enmity following his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from Paris; and, though he found asylum in the palace of Fontainebleau, his house was pillaged and his library burned in his absence. He resumed his chair after this for a time, but he was summoned on 30 June 1568 before the King&#x27;s Attorney General to be heard with Simon Baudichon and other professors: the position of affairs was again so threatening that he found it advisable to ask permission to travel.

He spent around two years in Germany and Switzerland. The La Rochelle Confession of Faith earned his disapproval, in 1571, rupturing his relationship with Theodore Beza and leading Ramus to write angrily to Heinrich Bullinger.

Returning to France, he fell a victim in the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre (1572). Hiding for a while in a bookshop off the Rue St Jacques, he returned to his lodgings, on 26 August, the third day of the violence. There he was stabbed while at prayer. Suspicions against Charpentier have been voiced ever since. His death was compared by one of his first biographers, his friend and colleague , to the murder of Cicero.

==Pedagogue==

A central issue is that Ramus&#x27;s anti-Aristotelianism arose out of a concern for pedagogy. Aristotelian philosophy, in its Early Modern form as scholasticism showing its age, was in a confused and disordered state. Ramus sought to infuse order and simplicity into philosophical and scholastic education by reinvigorating a sense of dialectic as the overriding logical and methodological basis for the various disciplines.

He published in 1543 the &quot;Aristotelicae Animadversiones&quot; and &quot;Dialecticae Partitiones&quot;, the former a criticism on the old logic and the latter a new textbook of the science. What are substantially fresh editions of the &quot;Partitiones&quot; appeared in 1547 as &quot;Institutiones Dialecticae&quot;, and in 1548 as &quot;Scholae Dialecticae&quot;; his &quot;Dialectique&quot; (1555), a French version of his system, is the earliest work on the subject in the French language.

In the &quot;Dialecticae partitiones&quot; Ramus recommends the use of summaries, headings, citations and examples. Ong calls Ramus&#x27;s use of outlines, &quot;a reorganization of the whole of knowledge and indeed of the whole human lifeworld.&quot;

After studying Ramus&#x27;s work, Ong concluded that the results of his &quot;methodizing&quot; of the arts &quot;are the amateurish works of a desperate man who is not a thinker but merely an erudite pedagogue&quot;. On the other hand, his work had an immediate impact on the issue of disciplinary boundaries, educators largely having accepted his arguments by the end of the 17th century.

==Logician==

The logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time, and there existed a school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. It cannot be said, however, that Ramus&#x27;s innovations mark any epoch in the history of logic, and there is little ground for his claim to supersede Aristotle by an independent system of logic. The distinction between natural and artificial logic, i.e., between the implicit logic of daily speech and the same logic made explicit in a system, passed over into the logical handbooks.

He amends the syllogism. He admits only the first three figures, as in the original Aristotelian scheme, and in his later works he also attacks the validity of the third figure, following in this the precedent of Laurentius Valla. Ramus also set the modern fashion of deducing the figures from the position of the middle term in the premises, instead of basing them, as Aristotle does, upon the different relation of the middle to the major term and minor term.

==Rhetorician==

As James Jasinski explains, &quot;the range of rhetoric began to be narrowed during the 16th century, thanks in part to the works of Peter Ramus.&quot; In using the word &quot;narrowed,&quot; Jasinski is referring to Ramus&#x27;s argument for divorcing rhetoric from dialectic (logic), a move that had far reaching implications for rhetorical studies and for popular conceptions of public persuasion. Contemporary rhetoricians have tended to reject Ramus&#x27;s view in favor of a more wide ranging (and in many respects, Aristotelian) understanding of the rhetorical arts as encompassing &quot;a [broad] range of ordinary language practices.&quot; Rhetoric, traditionally, had had five parts, of which &quot;inventio&quot; (invention) was the first. Ramus insisted on rhetoric to be studied alongside dialectic through two main manuals: invention and judgement under the dialectic manual, and style and delivery in the rhetoric manual. Memory, one of the five skills of traditional rhetoric, was regarded by Ramus as being part of psychology, as opposed to being part of rhetoric, and thus dispensed from his idea of rhetoric and dialectic. Brian Vickers said that the Ramist influence here did add to rhetoric: it concentrated more on the remaining aspect of &quot;elocutio&quot; or effective use of language, and emphasised the role of vernacular European languages (rather than Latin). Ramist reforms strengthened the rhetoricians&#x27; tendency to focus on style. The effect was that rhetoric was applied in literature.

Invention involves fourteen topics, including definition, cause, effect, subject, adjunct, difference, contrary, comparison, similarity, and testimony. Style encompasses four tropes: metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and irony. It also includes rules for poetic meter and rhythmical prose, figures corresponding to attitudes a speaker may take, and of repetition. Delivery covers the use of voice and gestures.

His rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of logic as the &quot;ars disserendi&quot;; he maintains that the rules of logic may be better learned from observation of the way in which Cicero persuaded his hearers than from a study of Aristotle&#x27;s works on logic (the &quot;Organon&quot;).

Logic falls, according to Ramus, into two parts: invention (treating of the notion and definition) and judgment (comprising the judgment proper, syllogism and method). Here he was influenced by Rodolphus Agricola. This division gave rise to the jocular designation of judgment or mother-wit as the &quot;secunda Petri&quot;. But what Ramus does here in fact redefines rhetoric. There is a new configuration, with logic and rhetoric each having two parts: rhetoric was to cover &quot;elocutio&quot; and &quot;pronuntiatio&quot;. In general, Ramism liked to deal with binary trees as method for organising knowledge.

==Mathematician==

He was also known as a mathematician, a student of Johannes Sturm. It has been suggested that Sturm was an influence in another way, by his lectures given in 1529 on Hermogenes of Tarsus: the Ramist method of dichotomy is to be found in Hermogenes.

He had students of his own. He corresponded with John Dee on mathematics, and at one point recommended to Elizabeth I that she appoint him to a university chair.

The views of Ramus on mathematics implied a limitation to the practical: he considered Euclid&#x27;s theory on irrational numbers to be useless. The emphasis on technological applications and engineering mathematics was coupled to an appeal to nationalism (France was well behind Italy, and needed to catch up with Germany).

==Ramism==
The teachings of Ramus had a broadly based reception well into the seventeenth century. Later movements, such as Baconianism, pansophism, and Cartesianism, in different ways built on Ramism, and took advantage of the space cleared by some of the simplifications (and oversimplifications) it had effected. The longest-lasting strand of Ramism was in systematic Calvinist theology, where textbook treatments with a Ramist framework were still used into the eighteenth century, particularly in New England.

The first writings on Ramism, after the death of Ramus, included biographies, and were by disciples of sorts: Freigius (1574 or 1575), Banosius (1576), (1599), of whom only Nancelius was closely acquainted with the man. Followers of Ramus in different fields included Johannes Althusius, Caspar Olevianus, John Milton, Johannes Piscator, Rudolph Snellius and Hieronymus Treutler.

<text>Franco Petri Burgersdijk, or Franciscus Burgersdicius (born Franck Pieterszoon Burgersdijk; 3 May 1590 – 19 February 1635), was a Dutch logician who worked as a professor of logic and moral philosophy and rector at Leiden University. Franco Burgersdijk&#x27;s teaching helped raise the profile of logic and philosophy in Dutch universities.

==Life==

Franco Burgersdijk was born on 3 May 1590, in De Lier. Burgersdijk spent much of his childhood on a farm, and attended the Latin Schools at both Amersfoort (16041606) and Delft Gymnasium (16061610). Shortly after, he decided to study theology at the University of Leiden. His growing interest in debate led him to become a mentee of Gisbertus Voetius, the vice principal of Staten Collegie. After finishing his education in Leiden, he further pursued his studies at the University of Saumur where he became a professor of philosophy in 1614. After the Arminian &quot;purification&quot; of universities of the Dutch Republic, Burgersdijk relocated back to Holland and became a professor of logic at the University of Leiden. He was later appointed as the chair of ethics and then exchanged it for the chair of philosophy. He died in Leiden.

The reason for Burgersdijk&#x27;s popularity stems from his first book, &quot;Idea Philosophiae Naturalis&quot;, which became the model for his later writings. His treatment of his subjects is clear, logical, concise and well organized. The method of orderly study he employed was designed to instill &quot;sound scholarship&quot;. Starting from his method of definition and classification, he examined the whole of natural philosophy in 26 disputations, each of which presented a set of theses that could be further examined by consulting the listed pros and cons instances. Another collection of disputations took place in the Collegium physicum. Burgersdijk&#x27;s reputation in the 17th century rested on his systematic manuals. They received their pedagogical importance from the efficient adaptation of the Corpus Aristotelicum to the standards of the humanistic method. Burgersdijk&#x27;s neo-Aristotelianism is related to the Contra-Remonstrant movement in the Dutch Republic.

=== Religious troubles and their effect on Burgersdijk&#x27;s Academic Career ===
During the truce between the Dutch and Spanish armies in 1609, followers of theology professor Jacob Arminius requested the States of Holland to review certain religious issues. These issues consisted of a series of conflicts between Arminians, followers of Jacob Arminius, and Gomarists, followers of Fransicus Gomarus. These conflicts arose due to different interpretations of the holy scripture.

Their debate was deeply entangled in Dutch politics for years. In 1608, conflicts escalated when the Staats General (general assembly) of the Federal Dutch state requested a synod; this was opposed by the Province of Holland, which supported the Arminians. In response, the Province of Holland used its military power to restore order. However, this brought them into conflict with the Stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange, who staged a coup and gained control of the entire country, thus ending the political skirmish. The religious conflict shortly ended after the international Synod of Dort ruled in favor of Gomarists on May 9, 1619.

Due to the ruling, all Arminianism was effectively removed from the Republic. The removal brought about openings at the University of Leiden. Burgersdijk saw this as an opportunity to go back to Holland. He was appointed a professor of logic and was later promoted to the chair of ethics. His studies of theological education were completed in 1623.

In 1626, Burgersdijk was tasked with editing Johannes de Sacrobosco’s &quot;De sphaera&quot; to rid the book of its Latin.

=== Interest in Philosophy ===
Burgersdijk participated in two disputes in 1623 and 1627 which involved the Aristotelian knowledge corpus on natural knowledge. His former professor and the chair of philosophy at the University of Leiden, Jacchaeus (Gilbert Jack), quarreled with Burgersdijk because he believed that Burgersdijk was exceeding the remit of his department. After Jacchaeus&#x27;s death in 1628, Burgersdijk exchanged his chair of ethics for the chair of philosophy.

Although Burgersdijk was known to believe in Aristotelian principles, he also believed in the birth of new stars and the supernatural effects of the heavens on the terrestrial world.

===Career===

He received his first appointment at the Protestant Academy of Saumur, where he was professor of philosophy from 1616 to 1619. He returned to Leiden as a professor of logic and ethics and gave his inaugural lecture &quot;De fructu et utilitate logices&quot; in 1620. Appointed to the chair of philosophy in 1628, Burgersdijk became a leading figure at the university, serving as rector (1629, 1630, 1634) and writing influential textbooks on natural philosophy, metaphysics, logic, ethics, and politics.

===Accomplishments===

In 1625 new regulations were issued. Some ethics, physics, and geography could be taught in the final year, and Burgersdijk was asked to elevate the medieval &#x27;barbaric&#x27; Latin of Johannes de Sacrobosco&#x27;s &quot;De sphaera&quot; to humanistic standards by making &#x27;astronomy&#x27; clear and easy to understand. This textbook, commissioned by the Dutch States, should not be taken as an illustration of Burgersdijk&#x27;s conservatism. The aim was to familiarize the students with the &quot;basics&quot; of the subject, which, as stated in the introduction to the compendium, would have to be deepened at the university. In 1628, after the death of Jacchaeus, Burgersdijk exchanged moral philosophy for physics, but long before that he lectured on physics. In 1624 a first series of fifteen disputations dealing with the Aristotelian corpus of natural philosophy was held, and in 1627 the next series was organized. Although his orator Petrus Cunaeus noted that several friends of the deceased were astonished at this move, for &quot;the moral philosophy transmitted from heaven to earth by Socrates is the most outstanding part of philosophy&quot;, he remarked Burgersdijk&#x27;s humanistic ambition to that hidden in nature Truth, that a clear light may shine out of the darkness.&quot; He therefore clarified the Aristotelian philosophy taught &quot;by public authority&quot; in the schools and removed &quot;its obscurities&#x27;, which were later intensified &quot;scholastic &#x27;Commentators such as Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus.&#x27; Thus, Burgersdijk&#x27;s key terms are &quot;method&quot; and &quot;system&quot;, with &quot;order&quot; being a necessary condition of a science.

==Works==
Burgersdijk was well known for his compendium of logic. He wrote the &quot;Institutionum logicarum&quot;, in two books, which emphasized order and method. He took inspiration from Aristotle, but he also followed the methods of Petrus Ramus.

Burgersdijk&#x27;s second compendium was of moral and political thought. This compendium was also heavily influenced by Aristotle.

<doc id="311659" wikidata="Q427532" url="?curid=311659" title="Sensationalism">
<text>In journalism and mass media, sensationalism is a type of editorial tactic. Events and topics in news stories are selected and worded to excite the greatest number of readers and viewers. This style of news reporting encourages biased or emotionally loaded impressions of events rather than neutrality, and may cause a manipulation to the truth of a story. Sensationalism may rely on reports about generally insignificant matters and portray them as a major influence on society, or biased presentations of newsworthy topics, in a trivial, or tabloid manner, contrary to general assumptions of professional journalistic standards.

Some tactics include being deliberately obtuse, appealing to emotions, being controversial, intentionally omitting facts and information, being loud and self-centered, and acting to obtain attention. Trivial information and events are sometimes misrepresented and exaggerated as important or significant, and often include stories about the actions of individuals and small groups of people, the content of which is often insignificant and irrelevant to the macro-level day-to-day events occurring globally.

== History ==

In &quot;A History of News&quot;, Mitchell Stephens notes sensationalism can be found in the Ancient Roman gazette &quot;Acta Diurna&quot;, where official notices and announcements were presented daily on public message boards, the perceived content of which spread with enthusiasm in illiterate societies. Sensationalism was used in books of the 16th and 17th century, to teach moral lessons. According to Stephens, sensationalism brought the news to a new audience when it became aimed at the lower class, who had less of a need to accurately understand politics and the economy, to occupy them in other matters. Through sensationalism, he claims, the audience was further educated and encouraged to take more interest in the news. 

The more modern forms of sensationalism developed in the course of the nineteenth century in parallel with the expansion of print culture in industrialized nations. A genre of British literature, &quot;sensation novels,&quot; became in the 1860s an example of how the publishing industry could capitalize on surprising narrative to market serialized fiction in periodicals. The attention-grasping rhetorical techniques found in sensation fiction were also employed in articles on science, modern technology, finance, and in historical accounts of contemporary events. Sensationalism in nineteenth century could be found in popular culture, literature, performance, art history, theory, pre-cinema, and early cinema. 

In the Soviet Union, strong censorship resulted in only &quot;positive occurrences&quot; being reported on, with the news looking significantly different than in the West. 

In the United States, modern sensationalism in the news increased after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 by the Federal Communications Commission which required broadcasters when showing one partisan view to show another and in order to be a broadcaster one needed a license. In Western Europe sensationalism in the news also increased after the liberalization of television networks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

== Underlying causes ==
=== The role of profit ===

In the late 1800s, falling costs in paper production and rising revenues in advertising in the U.S. led to a drastic rise in newspaper&#x27;s circulation, which attracted the growing audiences that advertisers desired. One presumed goal of sensational reporting is to increase or sustain viewership or readership, from which media outlets can price their advertising higher to increase their profits based on higher numbers of viewers and/or readers. Sometimes this can lead to a lesser focus on objective journalism in favor of a profit motive, in which editorial choices are based upon sensational stories and presentations to increase advertising revenue. Additionally, advertisers tend to have a preference for their products or services to be reported positively in mass media, which can contribute to bias in news reporting in favor of media outlets protecting their profits and revenues, rather than reporting objectively about stated products and services. The more dependent news organizations are on advertising revenue a greater number of sensationalist news stories are produced is argued by Paul Hendriks Vettehen and Mariska Kleemans in &quot;Proving the Obvious? What Sensationalism Contributes to the Time Spent on News Video&quot;.

The Watergate scandal has been credited by some with creating distrust in government and opening the door for a new business tactic for the media that resulted in the spread of negative, dishonest and misleading news coverage of American politics; such examples include the labeling of a large number of political scandals, regardless of their importance, with the suffix &quot;-gate&quot;. 

Sensationalism has also been blamed for the infotainment style of many news programs on radio and television. According to sociologist John Thompson, the debate of sensationalism used in the mass medium of broadcasting is based on a misunderstanding of its audience, especially the television audience. Thompson explains that the term &#x27;mass&#x27; (which is connected to broadcasting) suggests a &#x27;vast audience of many thousands, even millions of passive individuals&#x27;. Television news is restricted to showing the scenes of crimes rather than the crime itself because of the unpredictability of events, whereas newspaper writers can always recall what they did not witness.

On web-based platforms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube their respective algorithms are used to maximize advertising revenue by attracting and keeping the attention of users. This business model results in sensationalist content often being prioritized as algorithms often predict that it will get the highest amount of engagement.
=== Novelty and unusualness ===

When trying to cater to younger audiences, news stories that are more sensational and unusual will often drown out stories that may be considered less exciting but more significant. In &quot;Mass Media and American Politics&quot;, Doris A. Graber and Johanna Dunaway give the example of how the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; will give 20 times more space to sports in comparison to the state government. Covering singular news stories that are considered dramatic can lead to other stories being obscured.

=== Time constraints ===

In a 24-hour news cycle, there will be instances where there is little news happening along with no developments in stories that are considered important and because of this they will need to fill the time by sharing a story that is less so about actual news and more intended to keep the audience&#x27;s attention.

=== Competition ===
In news markets where there is more competition, the more likely a certain news outlet will be to produce sensationalist stories as a way to compete with other outlets, creating a snowball effect .

== Features of sensationalism ==
=== Language ===

One feature of sensationalistic news is the intensification of language used in the article. The most common use of sensationalist language is in the headlines of news articles.

&quot;Slam Journalism&quot; is a term describing the rise of intense, emotionally charged language in headlines, notably the use of the word &quot;slam&quot; to mean &quot;criticize.&quot; The data scientist Cory Booker suggests that news agencies simply &quot;[speak] the language that resonates with their audience best.&quot;

Below are examples of such headlines, with the intense language highlighted in bold.

* “Trump Slams Russia Investigation And Green New Deal At CPAC,&quot; NPR on March 2, 2019
* “Democrats Blast Biden For Recalling ‘Civil’ Relationship With Segregationists” NPR on June 19, 2019
* &quot;Ocasio-Cortez slams Jerry Falwell Jr. in debate over CPAC comments&quot; Fox News on March 5, 2019

=== The teaser ===
David Berube considers the use of headlines to be the primary way sensationalism manifests in media, by creating teasers that use emotion to try and capture the attention of an audience even if the headline exaggerates or is otherwise misleading. In YouTube videos, the thumbnail image of a video can similarly mislead audiences.

=== Fearmongering ===
The use of fearmongering is sometimes used by media outlets as well to gain attention to their content.

== Impacts of sensationalism ==
Zeynep Tufecki argues that it&#x27;s easier to shift the &quot;Overton window&quot; online thanks to algorithms replacing traditional gatekeepers of journalism.

C.P. Chandrasekhar argues that news outlets are at a higher risk of releasing content that is false because of how quickly news is circulated through the internet in order to capitalize on those views and clicks for profit. 

Joe Sommerlad criticized algorithms used by Google News for not promoting more trustworthy sources.

=== Distortion of events ===

==== Overrepresentation of crime ====

One of the most prominent and most covered news topics is crime being represented disproportionately to other social problems. Most often what is covered is the &quot;accounts of the commission of crime and law-enforcement activities.&quot; A lesser amount but still significant level is given to court proceedings and the least related to corrections giving the public a limited understand of the criminal justice system and the social contexts of crime.

==== Exaggeration of science news ====

With science news, the press release may be relied upon heavily, which can exaggerate or spin the findings. One theory for this practice, in addition to time constraints, is that journalists do not access academic articles as much since many are behind paywalls. One example of sensationalism in science news was in 1998 when Andrew Wakefield published a study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; showing a link between MMR vaccines and autism with it reaching the news media via press releases and a news conference getting widespread coverage despite the publication being flawed and the article later being debunked and retracted.

=== Political polarization and democratic backsliding ===
Political polarization and democratic backsliding can be exacerbated by the media environment and its incentives towards sensationalism. Algorithms that elevate senstional and inflammatory content across a range of platforms including social media, Google, and others have received criticism as fueling division in society. This extends beyond sorting people into echo chambers and filter bubbles to include radicalization by showing more extreme content in order to boost engagement.

== Responses to sensationalism ==
Fact-checking websites, media literacy, better content moderation on social media, and legislation have been pursued to reduce the negative impacts of algorithms and sensational media. When American public television news came about in the mid-20th century it came about in part in response to the commercial news stations having sensationalized news prioritized above that of &quot;serious reporting&quot;.

Some have argued tha different algorithms and platform incentives are needed to reduce modern sensationalism both online and among politicians reacting to those online incentives. Andrew Leonard describes Pol.is as one possible solution to the sensationalism of traditional discourse on social media that has damaged democracies, citing the use of its algorithm to instead prioritize finding consensus.

<doc id="311663" wikidata="Q2429969" url="?curid=311663" title="Rainhill">
<text>Rainhill is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, Merseyside, England. The population at the 2011 census was 10,853.

Historically part of Lancashire, Rainhill was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of Prescot and hundred of West Derby. Following the Local Government Act 1894, it became part of the Whiston Rural District.

The Rainhill Trials of 1829 resulted in the selection of Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; as the world&#x27;s first modern steam locomotive.

==History==

===Early history===
Rainhill has been recorded since Norman times but its name is believed to come from the Old English personal name of Regna or Regan. It is thought that around the time of the Domesday Book Rainhill was a part of one of the townships within the &quot;Widnes fee&quot;. Recordings have shown that in the year 1246, Roger of Rainhill died and the township was divided into two halves for each of his daughters. One half was centred on the now-standing Rainhill Manor public house, see Rainhill Stoops below, and the other centred on Rainhill Hall, just off Blundell&#x27;s Lane.

===Industrial Revolution===
Towards the end of the 18th century, four Catholic sons of a farmer, who came from the area around Stonyhurst, decided to seek their fortunes in Liverpool. The names of the brothers were Joseph, Francis, Peter and Bartholomew Bretherton. In 1800, Bartholomew decided to break into the coaching business. The partnership that he had with one or two of his brothers quickly built up and by 1820, he had the bulk of the coaching trade of Liverpool. He was running coaches to and from Manchester fourteen times a day from the Saracen&#x27;s Head in Dale Street, Liverpool. Bartholomew chose Rainhill as his first stage and he developed facilities on the land alongside the Ship Inn (originally the New Inn by Henry Parr 1780) and on this site, he was believed to be stabling at least 240 horses, coach horses, and farriers, coachbuilders and veterinaries.

Bartholomew had begun to purchase land in Rainhill, and in 1824, he bought the Manor of Rainhill from Dr James Gerrard of Liverpool. By 1830, he owned over around Rainhill. In 1824, across the road from the stables, he built Rainhill House and laid out beautiful gardens around it. Between 1923 and 2014 the house was known as Rainhill Hall, serving as a retreat centre run by the Society of Jesus. Since 2017 it has reverted to Rainhill Hall and is a wedding venue.

During the Victorian era, Rainhill was the location of a notorious mass murderer; Frederick Bailey Deeming. In March 1892, the bodies of a woman and her four children were discovered buried under the concrete floor of Dinham Villa, Lawton Road, Rainhill.
Rainhill was the site of the 1829 Rainhill trials, in which several railway locomotives were entered in a competition to decide a suitable design for use on the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The winner was the Rocket designed by George Stephenson. In 1979 the 150th anniversary of the trials was celebrated by a cavalcade of trains through the ages, including replicas of the winner and runner-up in the trials.

==Geography==
The village of Rainhill lies east of Prescot, south-southwest of St Helens, east-northeast of Huyton and east of Liverpool City Centre.

===Rainhill Stoops===
The most southerly area of Rainhill is known as Rainhill Stoops.

The name of junction 7 of the M62 motorway and the A570 is known as &quot;Rainhill Stoops&quot;.

Warrington Road was a prominent road as a route between the larger settlements of Liverpool, Prescot and Warrington with Rainhill on the route. The stoops (a historic marker, waypost or similar guide) existed along the road at key positions.

With the establishment in 1753 of the Liverpool to Prescot turnpike, and its subsequent extension to Rainhill and then on to Warrington, a system of toll bars was installed with one such barrier at the stoops.

==Landmarks==

Rainhill has several churches including St Ann&#x27;s, St Bartholomew&#x27;s and St James&#x27; – which are Church of England, Roman Catholic and Methodist, respectively. There is also an evangelical church. St Ann&#x27;s well, a medieval stone-lined structure is on the border with Sutton.

A feature of the village is the George Stephenson Skew Bridge, a skew arch bridge of sandstone construction that carries the main road over the railway. It takes its name from the unusual diagonal angle at which the railway passes under the bridge. It is the world&#x27;s first bridge to cross over a railway at an angle. The bridge was later widened to accommodate increases in road traffic. The milestone on the bridge that informs travellers of the distances to Warrington, Prescot and Liverpool was moved to the opposite side at the time of the expansion. Therefore, the distance markers pointed to the wrong destinations. This quirk was corrected in 2005 when the milestone was returned to the correct side of the bridge.

==Economy==
Rainhill is now primarily a commuter village, mainly for workers in Liverpool but also St Helens and Widnes. Housing on the southerly side of Rainhill is a mixture of semi-detached and detached dwellings, whereas homes to the north, across the Skew Bridge there is a more varied mixture of housing with examples of terraced with semi-detached as well as bungalows. Rainhill as a whole has a mixture of modern, inter-war and Victorian dwellings.

Rainhill has several medical centres but the largest and most notable is Scott Clinic which once treated Michael Abram after he was convicted of stabbing Beatles member George Harrison. Rainhill was also home to Rainhill Hospital at one time the largest mental health asylum in the world; which, in December 1911, housed 1,990 patients. This was demolished in 1991. Its former site is now a housing estate as well as accommodating Reeve Court, an extra-care housing project for older people.

Former Beatles guitarist and famous Liverpudlian George Harrison makes a jokey reference to Rainhill in a lyric in the title song from his 1982 LP Gone Troppo.

&quot;Quite like, you ain&#x27;t seen a sunset. Could be, living in Rainhill&quot; - Gone Troppo (1982).

The reference contrasts Harrison’s good fortune at spending part of his time living in tropical parts of the globe like Hawaii and the Solomon Islands with his Merseyside roots.

<text>Lakmé is an opera in three acts by Léo Delibes to a French libretto by Edmond Gondinet and Philippe Gille.

The score, written from 1881 to 1882, was first performed on 14 April 1883 by the Opéra-Comique at the (second) Salle Favart in Paris, with stage decorations designed by Auguste Alfred Rubé and Philippe Chaperon (act 1), Eugène Carpezat and (Joseph-) Antoine Lavastre (act 2), and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (act 3). Set in British India in the mid-19th century, &quot;Lakmé&quot; is based on Théodore Pavie&#x27;s story &quot;Les babouches du Brahmane&quot; (1849) and the novel &quot;&quot; (1880) by Pierre Loti. Gondinet proposed it as a vehicle for the American soprano Marie van Zandt.

The opera includes the popular &quot;Flower Duet&quot; (&quot;Sous le dôme épais&quot;) for a soprano and mezzo-soprano, performed in act 1 by Lakmé, the daughter of a Brahmin priest, and her servant Mallika. The name &quot;Lakmé&quot; is the French rendition of Sanskrit Lakshmi, the name of the Hindu Goddess of Wealth. The opera&#x27;s most famous aria is the &quot;Bell Song&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Air des clochettes&quot;) in act 2.

&quot;Lakmé&quot; combines many orientalist aspects that were popular at the time: an exotic location, similar to other French operas of the period, such as Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; and Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot;, a fanatical priest, mysterious Hindu rituals, and &quot;the novelty of exotically colonial English people&quot;.

==Performance history==
Following its premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1883, &quot;Lakmé&quot; reached its 500th performance there on 23 June 1909 and 1,000th on 13 May 1931. A series of performances took place at the Théâtre Gaîté Lyrique Paris in 1908, with Alice Verlet, David Devriès and Félix Vieuille.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==

:Place: India
:Time: Late nineteenth century, during the British Raj.

===Act 1===
The Hindus go to perform their rites in a sacred Brahmin temple under the high priest, Nilakantha. Nilakantha&#x27;s daughter Lakmé, and her servant Mallika, are left behind and go down to the river to gather flowers where they sing together the &quot;Flower Duet&quot;. As they approach the water at the river bank, Lakmé removes her jewellery and places it on a bench. Two British officers, Frédéric and Gérald (Delibes uses Frenchified versions of the then common English names Frederick and Gerald), arrive nearby on a picnic with two British girls and their governess. The British girls see the jewellery and, impressed with it, request sketches of it; Gérald volunteers to stay and make sketches of the jewellery. He spots Lakmé and Mallika returning and hides. Mallika leaves Lakmé for a while; while alone Lakmé sees Gérald and, frightened by the foreigner&#x27;s incursion, cries out for help. However, simultaneously, she is also intrigued by him and so she sends away those who had responded to her call for help when they come to her aid. Lakmé and Gérald begin to fall in love with each other. Nilakantha returns and learns of the British officer&#x27;s trespassing, vowing revenge on him for what he assumes to be an affront to Lakmé&#x27;s honour.

===Act 2===
At a busy bazaar, Nilakantha forces Lakmé to sing (the &quot;Bell Song&quot;) in order to lure the trespasser into identifying himself. When Gérald steps forward, Lakmé faints, thus giving him away. Nilakantha stabs Gérald, wounding him. Lakmé takes Gérald to a secret hideout in the forest, where she lovingly nurses him back to health.

===Act 3===
In the forest, Lakmé and Gérald hear singing in the distance. Gérald is frightened, but Lakme tells him that the singers are a group of lovers that seek out the water of a magical spring. When drunk, the water grants eternal love to the couple. While Lakmé fetches water that will confirm the vows of the lovers, Fréderic, Gérald&#x27;s fellow British officer, appears and reminds him of his military duty to his regiment. Gérald sadly accepts that his colleague is correct. After Lakmé returns, she senses the change in Gérald and realises that she has lost him. Rather than live with dishonor, she tears a leaf from a poisonous datura tree and bites into it. She tells Gérald what she has just done and they drink the water together. Nilakantha finds their hut and enters as Lakmé is dying. She tells her father that she and Gérald drank from the magical spring. In that instant, she dies.

==Music==
In conventional form and pleasant style, but given over to the fashion for exoticism, the delicate orchestration and melodic richness earned Delibes a success with audiences. The passionate elements of the opera are given warm and expressive music, while the score in general is marked by subtle harmonic colours and deft orchestration. Oriental colour is used in prayers, incantations, dances and the scene in the market.

The act 2 aria &quot;Où va la jeune Hindoue?&quot; (the Bell Song) has long been a favourite recital piece for coloratura sopranos. (Recordings of it in Italian, as &quot;&quot;, also exist.)

In recent years, the Flower Duet in act 1 has become familiar more widely because of its use in advertisements, in particular a British Airways commercial, as well as in films. The duet sung by Lakme and Mallika was adapted for the theme &quot;Aria on air&quot; for the British Airways &quot;face&quot; advertisements of the 1980s by music composers Yanni and Malcolm McLaren.

<doc id="311666" wikidata="Q801113" url="?curid=311666" title="Liverpool Lime Street railway station">
<text>Liverpool Lime Street is a terminus railway station and the main station serving the city centre of Liverpool. Opened in August 1836, it is the oldest still-operating grand terminus mainline station in the world. A branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston terminates at the station, as does the original Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Journeys from Lime Street cover a wide range of destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.

Having realised that their existing Crown Street railway station was too far away from the city centre, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway commenced construction of the more central Lime Street station in October 1833. Designed by John Cunningham, Arthur Holme and John Foster Jr, it was officially opened in August 1836. Proving to be very popular with train commuters, expansion of the station had become necessary within six years of its opening. The first expansion, which was collaboratively produced by Joseph Locke, Richard Turner, William Fairbairn and John Kennedy, was completed in 1849 at a total cost of £15,000 (). During 1867, work upon a further expansion of Lime Street station commenced, during which time the present northern arched train shed was built. Designed by William Baker and Francis Stevenson, the train shed was the largest such structure in the world upon completion, featuring a span of , as well as the first to make extensive use of iron. During 1879, a second parallel southern train shed was completed.

Following the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, Lime Street station was the subject of various upgrades and alterations, including new signalling systems in and around the station, a redeveloped concourse, and new retail and office spaces. In 1962, regular electric services between Lime Street and Crewe were officially started and, in 1966, the station hosted the launch of its first InterCity service, which saw the introduction of a regular service between Liverpool and London. During the 1970s, a new urban rail network known as Merseyrail was developed, while all other long-distance terminal stations in Liverpool were closed, resulting in such services being centralised at Lime Street for the whole city. In October 2003, the Pendolino service operated by Virgin Trains West Coast was ceremonially unveiled at the station, introducing a faster service between Liverpool and London. In May 2015, the electrification of the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway route was completed, as well as the line to Wigan via St Helens Central.

Lime Street station is fronted by a large building designed in the Renaissance Revival style, the former North Western Hotel, which served as a hotel, office and student accommodation and now back to a hotel as the Radisson Red Liverpool Hotel. The hotel opened in December 2022.

Since the 1970s, the main terminal building has also provided direct access to the underground Lime Street Wirral Line station on the Merseyrail network. Beginning in the 1960s, the Concourse House office tower block and several retailers stood outside the southern train shed, but they were demolished in 2010. Lime Street is the largest and oldest railway station in Liverpool; it is one of 18 stations managed by national infrastructure maintenance company Network Rail. During 2017, work commenced at Lime Street station on a £340 million remodelling programme. In &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot;, written by columnist and editor Simon Jenkins, Lime Street Station was one of only ten stations to be awarded 5/5 stars.

==History==
===Origins===
The original terminus of the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR) was located at Crown Street, in Edge Hill, to the east of and outside the city centre. However, even before Edge Hill had been opened, it was apparent that there was a pressing need for another station to be built, which would this time be closer to the city centre. Accordingly, during October 1833, the construction commenced on a purpose-built station at Lime Street in the city centre; the land was purchased from Liverpool Corporation for £9,000 (). The means of connecting the new station to L&amp;MR&#x27;s network came in the form of a twin-track tunnel, which had been constructed between Edge Hill and the site of the new Lime Street station a year prior to work being started on the station itself; during the construction effort, the tunnel was frequently used to transport building materials for the station onto the site. The station was designed by the architects John Cunningham, Arthur Holme, and John Foster Jr.
During August 1836, Lime Street Station was officially opened to the public, although the construction process was not completed until the following year. This building was designed with four large gateways, two of which were intentionally nonfunctional. For its early operations, as a consequence of the steep incline uphill from Lime Street to Edge Hill, trains would be halted at Edge Hill and the locomotives detached from the trains; the practice of the era was for the passenger carriages to be taken down by gravity, during which the rate of descent would be controlled by brakemen located in a brake van. The return journey was achieved via the use of a stationary steam engine located at Edge Hill, which would be used to haul the carriages up to Edge Hill by rope. This system was constructed by the local engineering firm Mather, Dixon and Company, who worked under the direction of the engineer John Grantham. During 1870, this practice came to an end; instead, trains would enter and depart the station by conventional means.

===Early expansion===
Lime Street Station was a near-instant success with the railway-going public. Within six years of its opening, the rapid growth of the railways had necessitated the expansion of the original station. An early plan for the enlarged station would have involved the erection of an iron roof, similar to that found at Euston station (pre 1960&#x27;s rebuilding) in London, which was a ridge roof supported by iron columns. However, a different proposal quickly gained the approval of the station committee. A single curved roof was produced by a collaborative effort; designed and load tested by engineer Joseph Locke, with construction contracted to iron founder Richard Turner, and the work checked by engineer William Fairbairn and manufacturer John Kennedy. The expansion work was performed at a cost of £15,000 () and was completed during 1849, by which time the noted architect William Tite had also been involved. Meanwhile, during 1845, the L&amp;MR had been absorbed by its principal business partner, the Grand Junction Railway (GJR); the following year the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway. Amongst the features which date back to the 1846–1849 rebuild of the station are a group of four columns which adjoin former Platform 1, they have been attributed to engineer Edward Woods.

By 1857, a pair of granite columns had been erected outside the station entrance; over time, these had become known as the &quot;Candlesticks&quot;. During 1867, further expansion of Lime Street Station was required to cope with operational demands; changes included the present northern arched train shed. Designed by William Baker and Francis Stevenson the train shed featured a span of , leading to it being recognised as the largest such structure in the world at the time. It was also the first train shed in which iron was used throughout. During 1879, a second parallel southern train shed was completed, which had been designed by Stevenson and E.W. Ives. This second train shed featured dry construction techniques, while each bay reportedly took only three days to build.
Lime Street Station is fronted by a large building, built in the Renaissance Revival style, which formerly housed the North Western Hotel. Designed by Alfred Waterhouse, the building was built during 1871 and served as student accommodation for Liverpool John Moores University from 1996. It was announced on 28 September 2018 that the building will be restored as a hotel by the Marcus Worthington Group at a cost of £30m. It will reopen as the Radisson RED Liverpool Hotel in 2020.

As a result of the Railways Act 1921, which grouped the majority of railway companies together to create the Big Four, Lime Street Station passed into the ownership of the newly formed London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) railway. The station played an early role in the development of mail trains, the Post Office first dispatched mail by train from Lime Street.

===British Rail era===
Upon nationalisation of the railways during 1948, Lime Street Station became a part of the London Midland Region of British Railways. On 28 January 1948, a new signal box controlling movements in and around Lime Street was commissioned; this signal box would remain in use for almost 70 years, being one of the last lever frames boxes still in operation by the time of its decommissioning during 2017–2018. During 1955, the station concourse was redeveloped and modernised. During 1959, preparatory work commenced at Lime Street for the first stage of the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. On 1 January 1962, regular electric services between Lime Street and Crewe were officially started.

The railway lines to former platforms 10 and 11 were removed by 1965. On 18 April 1966, the station hosted the launch of its first InterCity service, which saw the introduction of a regular service between Liverpool and London. On 11 August 1968, the &quot;Fifteen Guinea Special&quot;, a return service to Carlisle, was hauled by the Black Five locomotive 45110 from Liverpool to and back. Arriving back at Lime Street at 7:58 pm, this train marked the end of British Railways&#x27; final steam-hauled mainline passenger journey.
An office tower block named Concourse House, along with a row of small retail outlets, used to stand outside the southern train shed, obscuring the arches. These dated from the 1960s, and by the 2000s had become run down. They were demolished as part of a comprehensive refurbishment completed in 2010.

During the 1970s, a new urban rail network, known as Merseyrail was developed, resulting in four terminus stations being taken out of use in Liverpool and Birkenhead centres. As a consequence of this restructuring and rationalization, only Lime Street remained as a terminus, thus serving as a central point for the whole region for medium- and long-haul routes. At the same time, the Merseyrail network provided commuters with ease of access across the whole Merseyside region to the one remaining large terminus.

Between 1983 and 1984, the station concourse was again altered and refurbished at a total estimated cost of £7.4 million. This refurbishment included the construction of the black glass building which partially surrounds platforms inside the northern train shed, as well as the glass screen which separates the concourse from platforms inside the southern train shed. The alterations also coincided with the opening of the International Garden Festival. On 29 November 1984, the new development was officially opened by Princess Anne.

===Privatisation era===

On 20 October 2003, the new Pendolino service operated by private rail operator Virgin Trains, which introduced a faster service between Liverpool and London, was ceremonially unveiled in the presence of the company&#x27;s founder and chief executive officer Richard Branson. Designed from the onset to be a tilting train, it quickly replaced much of the previously-allocated locomotives and rolling stock used on the West Coast Main Line, namely the British Rail Class 86, 87 and 90 electric locomotives and Mark 2 and Mark 3 coaching stock. Prior to this, the fleet had been first introduced into passenger services from Birmingham International to Manchester Piccadilly on 23 July 2002 to coincide with the opening of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

To help celebrate several high-profile occasions, such as Liverpool&#x27;s role as European Capital of Culture during 2008, and the city&#x27;s 800th anniversary in 2007, a £35 million redevelopment grant was issued for the station and its immediate surroundings. The Lime Street Gateway Project saw the demolition of the aging retail parade and office block located in front of the station, and an improved frontage and public plaza constructed in its place. Subsequently, Lime Street was voted &quot;Station of the Year 2010&quot; at the National Rail Awards. The development was overseen by English Partnerships and was completed in October 2010.

The main concourse features a pair of statues of comedian Ken Dodd and politician Bessie Braddock, a work entitled &quot;Chance Meeting&quot; by sculptor Tom Murphy, which were unveiled by Ken Dodd himself during June 2009. On 31 August 2014, the Earl of Wessex unveiled a memorial to the Liverpool Pals at the station. The memorial, which comprises two bronze friezes, was also sculpted by Tom Murphy. During 2014, former Platforms 1–5 were fully refurbished by national rail infrastructure maintenance company Network Rail.

====Electrification to Manchester and Wigan====
Completion of electrification of the former Liverpool and Manchester Railway&#x27;s route, and the line to Wigan via St Helens Central, during May 2015 led to a recast of timetables. This included the introduction of a brand new TransPennine Express service to Newcastle via Manchester Victoria, running alongside the existing service to via and . It was unclear whether suitable electric rolling stock would be available in time for the completion of the work, but it was confirmed during April 2014 that electric trains would be available to operate the new electric services, and the first trains were introduced from March 2015, initially on the service to , with services to , and following over the course of the year.

====2017 wall collapse====
At around 17:45 on 28 February 2017, the station was cut off after a wall collapsed into the cutting between Lime Street and Edge Hill, causing more than 200 tonnes of debris to fall onto all four of the tracks running into the throat of the station. While the line was blocked, Virgin trains terminated at Runcorn and other trains terminated at Liverpool South Parkway. The debris was cleared up, with repairs made to the overhead wires, and the station reopened just over a week later on 8 March 2017.

====2017–18 station remodelling====

During 2017, work commenced upon a £340 million remodelling programme intended to improve Lime Street Station by modernising its signalling systems, install new platforms, and other to better conform with current demands. A major impetus for the work was the age of the station&#x27;s signalling, the core of which dated from the 1940s and was increasingly difficult to acquire knowledgeable staff for its operation and maintenance; furthermore, as resignalling of the existing station layout offered only slightly less work than the implementation of an entirely fresh layout, only without the benefits of being able to do so, it was decided to take the rare occasion as a convenient chance to make various alterations and improvements at the same time. Perhaps the most noticeable change made for the perspective of passengers was the creation of an additional pair of platforms, which were built in the large space available between Platforms 7 and 8 (now 6 and 9); all of the other platforms were also lengthened and widened as a part of this work.

According to industry publication &quot;Rail Engineer&quot;, the old layout of the station was relatively complex and posed some operational difficulties; many of the alterations sought to ease or eliminate some of these issues. As the curving of Platform 6 (now 5) had been a source of long-term driver difficulty in maintaining signal sightings, the platform was reprofiled to be straighter, permanently ending the problem. The new layout provides five platforms on each side of the station; beyond being simpler, the change facilitates the departure speed being increased from 15 to 25 mph and is also compatible with being maintained by modern mechanised equipment. In conjunction with the layout changes, new Mk3D overhead line equipment was installed along the route between Lime Street station and Edge Hill. Control of the signalling was transferred over to the centralised Manchester Rail Operating Centre.

The remodelling of Lime Street had been deemed necessary in order to provide the capacity for additional services to Glasgow, which are set to start during 2019. Various new retail outlets, along with a supermarket, were also established by work performed during the programme. To accommodate the work, the station was mostly closed over a twenty-three day period, which started on 30 September 2017; during the latter stages of this blockade, limited services ran to/from Huyton and some destinations beyond this. The station closed from 2 June 2018 to 29 July 2018 to allow more of the remodelling to be undertaken.

Liverpool Lime Street is divided into two sections: the mainline station, which offers national inter-city and regional overground services including local City Line routes, and services on the Wirral Line on the Merseyrail network, located underground between the mainline station and St George&#x27;s Hall.

==Mainline station==
The mainline station is covered by the vast iron and glass roofs dating from the 1870s. The north train shed is fronted by a 1871 French Château styled building occupied by the Radisson RED Liverpool Hotel. The hotel is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2022.

Platforms 1 to 5 are shorter than 6 to 10, the latter dealing mainly with long-distance services to London, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and Norwich. Access to platforms 1–5 is through a ticket inspection barrier similar to airport passport control, while former platform 7 was gated with the creation of new shops and facilities. Former Platforms 8 and 9 were still &quot;open&quot;.

In 2009, new buildings were erected in the old &quot;cab road&quot; area between former platforms 7 and 8. Until the 2018 station remodelling, these housed customer lounges, the Virgin Trains customer service point, and an ATM, and there were retail units which had coffee shops amongst the units.

There were also four non-passenger tracks. Three of these were headshunts, created in the northern trainshed to turn locomotives around: Track A, in between former platforms 1 and 2; track B, serving former platforms 3 and 4; and track D, for former platforms 5 and 6. There is also a platform with no passenger service between former platforms 6 and 7, known as platform E, or sometimes affectionately as platform 6¾.
===Facilities===
Toilets, booking offices, shops, a left-luggage office, taxi ranks and coffee bars are amongst the facilities provided. The main booking office is operated by Northern Trains. The concourse of the station contains several shops, including branches of M&amp;S Simply Food, Starbucks, Upper Crust, Krispy Kreme, Costa Coffee, Boots and WHSmith. Car parking is managed by APCOA. The station also has two taxi ranks.

===Public transport links===
The station has direct bus services to the Liverpool One bus station on the 10A and 18 route, from the bus station for Liverpool John Lennon Airport use services 86A (frequent &amp; night services) and 500. The bus services are provided by Arriva North West

====Service summary====

===Proposed services===

====CrossCountry Trains Consultation 2018====

The Department for Transport&#x27;s 2018 consultation on the future of the CrossCountry franchise, which was due for renewal in 2019 but was later cancelled in September 2018 but cited Liverpool as a potential new destination for CrossCountry train service. If adopted this may restore some of the services lost in 2003. The Consultation closed in August 2018. Despite the cancellation of the competition, the consultation responses will be used to help develop options for the future of the franchise so Liverpool may be considered as a potential destination in the future.

====Long Term Rail Strategy Proposals====

In a long term rail strategy by Merseytravel, new direct services to Cardiff, Bristol, Leicester, Derby, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley have been proposed.

====Virgin Trains Open Access Proposal====

In June 2019, Virgin Trains lodged an application for an open access service from to Liverpool Lime Street calling at , , , and Liverpool Lime Street to rival the future West Coast Partnership franchise Avanti West Coast from December 2022.

====West Coast Partnership====

In August 2019, it was announced that Avanti West Coast would operate the West Coast Partnership franchise from December 2019. As part of the award, the new operator will look at providing up to two trains per hour between Liverpool Lime Street and from December 2022, subject to approval by the Office of Rail and Road.

====Future Northern and TransPennine Franchises====

In November 2018, it was revealed by Transport for the North several options for the future Northern and TransPennine franchise. Some options for Liverpool include extension of Liverpool to Crewe services towards Stoke-on-Trent and Alsager, increasing Liverpool to Blackpool North services and a new Liverpool to Leicester service via Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent, Uttoxeter and Derby. The Leicester service could be operated by either TransPennine Express or the future East Midlands Franchise.

====TransPennine Franchise Agreement====
As part of the TransPennine Express (TPE) franchise agreement (awarded to FirstGroup which started services in April 2016), there will be three new direct services per day to Glasgow Central via Preston along the West Coast main line. The current hourly TPE Newcastle route was extended via to Edinburgh Waverley in December 2019.

In 2005 Renaissance Trains proposed a twice-daily service from Lime Street to Glasgow Central, with weekend trains running instead from Blackpool to Glasgow. The proposal did not get enough investment backing, but was revived in 2014.

====Chester, Wales and Shrewsbury via the Halton Curve====
The completion of the upgrade of the Halton Curve in 2018 provides a second rail route between Liverpool and Chester, and permits the introduction of new direct services from Liverpool to Wrexham, Llandudno and other parts of North Wales. 
As part of the new Wales &amp; Borders franchise services to Chester were introduced in May 2019 with future services to Llandudno and Shrewsbury every hour and services to Cardiff every two hours planned.

====London Euston====
It was also proposed that by 2016 London Midland would also operate an hourly service to London Euston (as an extension of its existing Trent Valley semi-fast service), however, this was rejected by the Office of Rail Regulation. From May 2019 to December 2019, its successor London Northwestern Railway operated a London to Liverpool service via Birmingham New Street.

====Northern Franchise Agreement====
As part of the Northern franchise agreement (awarded to Arriva, which started in April 2016), from December 2019 there will be a new &quot;Northern Connect&quot; service to Leeds via Manchester Victoria and Bradford Interchange (replacing the current all-stations local service to Victoria). This is the first time there is a direct service through to Rochdale, Halifax and Bradford Interchange since the timetable change on 10 December 2006 when Northern terminated all services at Manchester Victoria.

==Underground station==
The underground station consists of a single platform (sometimes referred to as Platform L), alongside the 1970s &quot;Liverpool Loop tunnel&quot; and a ticket hall above. The station, opened in 1977, is connected to the mainline station by means of a pedestrian subway and escalators, accessed via a long passageway which crosses beneath Lime Street itself, and by a lift from the main concourse.

===2013 refurbishment===
Network Rail announced in early 2013 that Lime Street was to be the third station to be refurbished as part of the £40 million investment which would see all Merseyrail underground stations excluding Conway Park refurbished. This included the refurbishment of the platform and the booking hall. The station refurbishment work took place between April and August 2013.

===Subway refurbishment===
The subway linking the underground station to the mainline station was refurbished in June 2014. The subway was fitted out with new tiles, lighting, flooring and automatic doors to some of the entrances.

===Recent history===
The underground station had Wi-Fi installed in January 2016.

In March 2016, it was announced that the Wirral Line loop would be having its track renewed. The underground station was closed between 3 January 2017 and 18 June 2017 whilst the works took place.

===Services===
Services operate on a five-minute frequency Monday-Saturday, and between five- and ten-minute frequency on Sundays in the winter. All trains travel through to Liverpool Central and Birkenhead of which:

*Four trains per hour continue to New Brighton
*Four trains per hour continue to West Kirby
*Four trains per hour continue to Chester
*Two trains per hour continue to Ellesmere Port

To reach destinations on the Northern Line of the network, passengers must either use the Wirral Line and change at Liverpool Central station or walk the short distance to the station.

<text>Chanthaburi (, ; Chong: &quot;chankabui&quot;, ) is one of seven provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) in eastern Thailand, on the border with Battambang and Pailin of Cambodia, on the shore of the Gulf of Thailand. Neighbouring provinces are Trat in the east and Rayong, Chonburi, Chachoengsao, and Sa Kaeo to the west and north.

== History ==
The indigenous people of the Chanthaburi region are the &quot;Chong&quot;. The &quot;Chong&quot; have lived in the area since the Ayutthaya Kingdom, and are thought to have been early inhabitants of Cambodia, possibly pre-dating the Khmer. In Chanthaburi province, the &quot;Chong&quot; predominantly inhabit the districts of Khao Khitchakut, Pong Nam Ron, and Makham.

After the Paknam crisis in 1893, French colonial troops occupied Chanthaburi, returning it in 1905 when Thailand gave up ownership of the western part of Cambodia. A significant minority of Chanthaburi citizens are ethnic Vietnamese, who came there in three waves: first in the 19th century during anti-Catholic persecutions in Cochin China; a second wave in the 1920s to 1940s fleeing French Indochina; and a third wave after the communist victory in Vietnam in 1975. The town of Chanthaburi has been the seat of a Bishop of Chanthaburi since 1944.

Chanthaburi once used to be an important source of gemstones, especially rubies and sapphires. While the Chantaboon Waterfront Community was developed over three centuries ago during the reign of King Narai along the banks of the River Mae Nam Chantaburi. It was an essential transportation and trade hub. Over the years, the Chantaboon Waterfront Community had lost its sheen. However, in the recent decade, the locals with the help of Thai officials have contributed to its revival as a major destination for cultural tourism.

== Geography ==
While the southern part of the province is on the shore of the Gulf of Thailand and thus is mostly coastal alluvial plains, the interior of the province is mountainous. The Chanthaburi Mountains in the north has the highest elevation in the province, the 1,675 m high Khao Soi Dao Tai peak. The main river of the province is the Chanthaburi River. The total forest area is or 32.4 percent of provincial area.&lt;br&gt;
Together with the neighboring province, Trat, Chanthaburi is a center of gemstone mining, especially rubies and sapphires. Tropical fruits are also among the main products of the province. In 2000, it produced nearly 380,000 tonnes of durian, which was 45.57 percent of Thailand&#x27;s durian production, approximately 27 percent of the entire world&#x27;s production.

== Symbols ==
The provincial seal shows the moon surrounded by an aura. Inside the moon disc is a rabbit, as in Thai folklore the dark areas on the moon (maria) form the shape of a rabbit. The seal symbolizes the peace and tranquility of the province. The moon also refers to the meaning of the province, &quot;City of Moon&quot;, from &quot;Chantha-&quot; (, lit. &#x27;moon&#x27;) and &quot;buri&quot; (, lit. &#x27;city&#x27;).

The flag of the province also shows the seal in the middle, a white rabbit on a yellow moon disc, on a blue disc. The background of the flag is red, with the name of province in yellow written below the seal.

The provincial tree is &quot;Diospyros decandra&quot;. The provincial flower is an orchid (&quot;Dendrobium friedericksianum&quot;). The brackish fish flagfin prawn goby (&quot;Mahidolia mystacina&quot;) is the provincial aquatic animal, what with Chanthaburi is the type locality.

The provincial slogan is &quot;Renowned waterfalls. Town of fruit. Good pepper. Bountiful jewels. Chanthaboon Mats. Rich in nature. King Taksin the Great reunited the people and reclaimed our independence at Chanthaburi&quot;.

<text>Earlestown ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens in Merseyside, England. At the 2011 Census the town had a population of 10,830. The towns named is derived from one of its early settlers, Hardman Earle.

==History==
Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Earlestown is named after Sir Hardman Earle (11 July 1792 – 25 January 1877.) He was the Chairman of the London and North Western Railway.

In July 1831, the Warrington and Newton Railway was opened, less than six months after the Liverpool and Manchester railway began service. A railway station was built at the junction of the two railways, a mile west of the town of Newton in Makerfield, now Newton-le-Willows, and was given the name Newton Junction. A locomotive and wagon works was built just west of the station and a model town was constructed for its workers. In 1837, the name of the station was changed to Earlestown.

Locomotive building was concentrated in another area within Newton-le-Willows. Between 1833 and 1895, the Vulcan Foundry produced some 6,000 locomotives to become the fourth largest locomotive building firm in the country, almost 70% of which were exported. Vulcan Foundry received its final steam locomotive order in 1954, while Earlestown was home to the major wagon works.

Other significant (non-railway) employers in the town included Sankey Sugar, and T&amp;T Vicars, who produced biscuit manufacturing equipment. There were also the nearby Lyme and Wood pits, located in neighbouring village of Haydock.

==Community==
Newton-le-Willows has held a market by Royal Charter since the 14th century. By the 1890s, the Earlestown area of Newton-le-Willows had outgrown the older part of the town and so the market was moved to its current location in Earlestown and the market square is the town&#x27;s centre-piece. Today trading takes place on Friday, with a mixed flea market/car boot sale every Saturday. The Saturday Market features many regular traders selling tools, clothing, antiques, records, DVDs, model railways, wartime memorabilia as well as cheap house clearance and bric-a-brac.

Earlestown Town Hall is an imposing building, fronted by a war memorial. In 1962 the Beatles visited Earlestown for a night gig and played at the town hall. On the same night Newton Boys Club on Graffton Street was opened by Frankie Vaughan for the local community.
Another significant building included the art-deco former Curzon cinema which was demolished in January 2010.

Earlestown has a small but busy town centre with many shops including high-street outlets such as Tesco, Boots, Wilko and several high street banks alongside independent retailers, bookmakers and fast-food takeaways. There are a range of traditional pubs, such as The New Market, The Ram&#x27;s Head, The Railway Inn, The Griffin, and The Wellington. Earlestown is well served by many fast food outlets offering a good range of Indian and Chinese dishes as well as fish and chips and the ubiquitous McDonald&#x27;s. Most of the local restaurants are curry houses; Earlestown&#x27;s &#x27;curry quarter-of-a-mile&#x27; on Queen Street has three Indian restaurants and a Tandoori take-away.

==Governance==
Newton-le-Willows is part of the Parliamentary constituency of St Helens North. At the 2024 general election, David Baines was elected to this seat.

Earlestown is one of two council wards within Newton-le-Willows.

==Transport==
Due to its role in the history of rail travel, Earlestown has good rail connections with its railway station having frequent services to Liverpool, Manchester, Warrington and North Wales. Earlestown is also well located as far as the road network is concerned, being close to junction 9 of the M62 motorway, junctions 21A, 22 and 23 of the M6 motorway, and the A580 East Lancashire Manchester-Liverpool road.

<text>David Blondel (1591 – 6 April 1655) was a French Protestant clergyman, historian and classical scholar.

== Life ==
He was born at Châlons-en-Champagne. Ordained in 1614, he had positions as parish priest at Houdan and Roucy. After 1644, he was relieved of duties, and supported free to study full-time.

In 1650 he succeeded GJ Vossius in the professorship of history at the university of Amsterdam. His students included Francis Turretin, and Johann Georg Graevius.

== Works ==
His works were very numerous. In some of them he took a strong critical line with mythological and counterfeit material current as fact in the early modern period. This brought him the admiration of major Enlightenment intellectuals. Jonathan Israel writes:

...the real work of discrediting and disposing of the &quot;Oracula Sibyllina&quot;, Chaldean chronicles, and Orphic hymns, ... seemingly only began, as Diderot noted in 1751, in the 1650s when the Huguenot scholar David Blondel ... published his treatise on the &quot;Oracula&quot; in Amsterdam.

In his dissertation on Pope Joan (1647), he came to the conclusion, now generally accepted, that the story is a myth. Edward Gibbon wrote this in &quot;The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire&quot;:

She was annihilated by two learned protestants, Blondel and Bayle [...]

Indignation against him on account of this book came from Protestant polemicists.

His 1628 book against Francisco Torres conclusively demonstrated that the &quot;Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals&quot; were a very learned forgery. This work was praised by Voltaire, writing in his &quot;Dictionnaire Philosophique&quot;. Blondel tracked down sources actually used by the Pseudo-Isidore. Later scholarship has sustained his conclusions.

In a work written as he was going blind, he struck back against Jean-Jacques Chifflet, who had written in favour of the Spanish royal family&#x27;s genealogical claims, over those of the French kings. In 1655 he produced an anthology of extracts arguing for Protestant eirenicism.

<text>The Makah (; Makah: &quot;) are an Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Coast living in Washington, in the northwestern part of the continental United States. They are enrolled in the federally recognized Makah Indian Tribe of the Makah Indian Reservation, commonly known as the Makah Tribe.

Linguistically and ethnographically, they are closely related to the Nuu-chah-nulth and Ditidaht peoples of the West Coast of Vancouver Island, who live across the Strait of Juan de Fuca in British Columbia, Canada.

== Etymology and name ==
The Makah people refer to themselves as the &quot;, which translates to somewhere near to &quot;the people who live by the rocks and seagulls&quot;. Other thought translations include &quot;the people who live on the cape by the seagulls&quot;, and &quot;people of the point&quot;, as well as several others. This has sometimes been anglicized as Kwih-dich-chuh-ahtx&quot;.&quot;

The English name, &quot;Makah,&quot; is an exonym derived from the S&#x27;Klallam language name for the Makah, &quot;màq̓áʔa&quot;. It means &quot;generous with food&quot;.

=== Pre-colonial ===
Archaeological research suggests that Makah people have inhabited the area now known as Neah Bay for more than 6,000 years. Traditionally, the Makah lived in villages consisting of large longhouses made from western red cedar. These longhouses had cedar-plank walls which could be tilted or removed to provide ventilation or light. The cedar tree was of great value to Makah, who also used its bark to make water-resistant clothing and hats. Cedar roots were used in basket making. Whole trees were carved out to make canoes to hunt seals, gray whales and humpback whales.

Makah acquired much of their food from the ocean. Their diet consisted of whale, seal, fish, and a wide variety of shellfish. They would also hunt deer, elk, and bear from the surrounding forests. Women also gathered a wide variety of nuts, berries and edible plants and roots for their foods.

===Japanese castaways===
In 1834, a dismasted, rudderless ship from Japan ran aground near Cape Flattery. The Makah took the three survivors of the broken ship and held them as slaves for several months before taking them to Fort Vancouver. From there, the United States transported them by ship to London and eventually China, but they never reached Japan again.

===Treaty of Neah Bay===

On January 31, 1855, government-selected Makah representatives signed the Treaty of Neah Bay with the U.S. federal government, ceding much of their traditional lands. The treaty required the Makah to be restricted to the Makah Reservation (at in Clallam County), banned slavery, and preserved the Makah people&#x27;s rights to hunt whales and seals in the region. The Makah language was not used during the negotiation of the treaty, and the government used the S&#x27;Klallam-language name to refer to the tribe, rather than the Makah-language endoynm.

===Ozette village===
In the early 17th century, a mudslide engulfed part of a Makah village near Lake Ozette. The oral history of the Makah mentions a &quot;great slide&quot; which engulfed a portion of Ozette long ago. The mudslide preserved several houses and their contents in a collapsed state until the 1970s, when they were excavated by the Makah and archaeologists from Washington State University. Over 55,000 artifacts were recovered, representing many activities of the Makah, from whale and seal hunting to salmon and halibut fishing. Artifacts included toys, games, and bows and arrows. 

Archaeological test pits were excavated at the Ozette site in 1966 and 1967 by Richard Daugherty. However, it was not until 1970 that it became apparent what was buried there. After a storm in February 1970, tidal erosion exposed hundreds of well-preserved wooden artifacts. The excavation of the Ozette site began shortly after. University students worked with the Makah under the direction of archaeologists using pressurized water to remove mud from six buried long houses. The excavation went on for 11 years.

It produced more than 55,000 artifacts, many of which are on display in the Makah Cultural and Research Center. Opened in 1979, the museum displays replicas of cedar long houses as well as whaling, fishing, and sealing canoes.

==Culture==
Much of what is known about the traditional way of life of the Makah is derived from their oral traditions. Abundant archeological evidence excavated at the Ozette village site has also provided great insight into traditional Makah life.

Historically, the structure of Makah society is a class system; people in the middle or lower classes could gain better social status by marrying into the upper levels. The community was in mostly a cognatic descent structure.

The Makah traditional family consisted of parents and children living in a particular area. Members of Makah families were ranked in society according to their relationship to the chief of the tribe. There were no stratifications in gender roles; all genders were equal, participating in the hunting of whales and other livestock. Although men were more fishermen and hunters, women&#x27;s activities centered on gathering resources for the family.

=== Whaling ===
Makah oral history relates that their tradition of aboriginal whaling has been suspended and re-established several times. Most recently, the practice was suspended in the 1920s because the commercial whaling industry had depleted the stocks of humpback and gray whales; all hunting was called off.

After the gray whale was removed from the Endangered Species List, the Makah re-asserted their whaling rights. With the support and guidance of the United States government and the International Whaling Commission, the Makah successfully hunted a gray whale on May 17, 1999. According to federal law, the Makah are entitled to hunt and kill one baleen whale, typically a gray whale, each year. Archaeological records and oral history indicate a significant number of humpback whales were historically hunted as well. The Makah had gone over 70 years without catching a whale.


The Makah whaling technique is difficult and labor-intensive. The men hunt from cedar canoes, each seating six to nine people and more recently, from small fishing vessels. They take these into the Pacific Ocean adjacent to their reservation territory. Various traditional criteria are used to determine the best whale to harvest. By counting the whale&#x27;s exhalations, the hunters determine when the whale is about to dive, and determine from this the best time to strike. Approaching the whale&#x27;s left side, the hunter strikes when the whale is 3–4 feet deep, to avoid the force of the whale&#x27;s tail. The harpoon is 16–18 feet long, composed of two pieces of yew wood spliced together. Historically, hunters used a mussel shell tip, in conjunction with barbs from elk horns.

Since the late 20th century, hunters have used a steel &quot;yankee style&quot; head, but they have retained the yew wood shaft because of its flexibility, water resistance, and strength. Held fast to the whale, the harpoon shaft comes loose, to be recovered later, and a line is thrown from the canoe with seal skin floats attached, to provide drag to weaken the whale. In the past, a series of smaller lances were used to repeatedly strike the whale, gradually weakening and killing it, often over a period of hours, and in some cases, days. Recently, hunters have adopted use of a big-game rifle after the harpoon strike, to ensure a more efficient kill. The International Whaling Commission permits four cartridges in whaling: .458 Winchester Magnum, .460 Weatherby Magnum, .50 BMG, and the .577 Tyrannosaur, which the Makah fired in the 1999 hunt.

Once the whale has been killed, a crew member called the &quot;diver&quot; jumps into the water and cuts a hole through the bottom and top of the whale&#x27;s jaw, to which a tow line and float are attached. This holds the whale&#x27;s mouth shut and prevents the carcass from filling with water and sinking. Hunters tow the whale to shore, where it is received by members of the village.

Traditional ceremonies and songs are performed to welcome the whale&#x27;s spirit. Following this, the whale is divided in a precise and traditional fashion, with certain families having ownership of particular cuts. The &quot;saddle piece&quot; located midway between the center of the back and the tail is the property of the harpooner. It is taken to his home where a special ceremony is performed. The meat and oil are distributed to community members, and a great deal of it is consumed during a potlatch.

The Makah assert that their right to whaling is guaranteed in the 1855 Treaty of Neah Bay, which states in part: &quot;The right of taking fish and of whaling or sealing at usual and accustomed grounds and stations is further secured to said Indians in common with all citizens of the United States.&quot;

In September 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using a .460 caliber rifle, similar to that used in hunting elephants, despite court-imposed regulations governing the Makah hunt. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea after being confiscated and cut loose by the United States Coast Guard. The tribal council denounced the killing and announced their intention to try the individuals in tribal court.

===Ethnobotany===

=== Contemporary culture ===
In 1936, the Makah Tribe signed the Makah Constitution, accepting the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and establishing an elected tribal government. The constitution provided for a five-member Tribal Council. Each year the council elects a Tribal Chairperson. The Council develops and passes laws for the Makah Reservation.

The Makah Tribe hosts its annual major public gathering, Makah Days, in late August. It features a grand parade and street fair as well as canoe races, traditional games, singing, dancing, feasting, and fireworks.

Many Makah tribal members derive most of their income from fishing. Makah fish for salmon, halibut, Pacific whiting, and other marine fish. This makes them particularly vulnerable to effects of global warming: ocean acidification disrupts the development of the shells of molluscs (the fishes&#x27; main food source) and warming waters the salmon run. In response, the Makah tribe is drawing on traditional knowledge to create action plans for climate resilience that center tribal socioeconomic priorities. With the Hoh, Quileute, and Quinault Indian Nation, as well as the scientific community, the Makah conduct climate research at and monitor the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.

==Language==


The Makah language is the Indigenous language spoken by the Makah people. The endonym for the language is .

Makah linguistically belongs to the Southern Nootkan branch of the Wakashan family of languages. It is also the only Wakashan language in the United States. Other tribes speaking Wakashan are located in British Columbia, Canada, immediately across the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and northwards as far as that province&#x27;s Central Coast region.

Makah has been extinct as a first language since 2002, when its last fluent native speaker died. However, it survives as a second language. The Makah Tribe is also working to revive the language, and has established preschool classes to teach its children.

==Reservation==

The Makah Tribe owns the Makah Indian Reservation on the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula; it includes Tatoosh Island. They live in and around the town of Neah Bay, Washington, a small fishing village.

Tribal census data from 1999 show that the Makah Tribe has 1,214 enrolled members; some 1,079 live on the reservation. The unemployment rate on the reservation is approximately 51%.

==Literary and cultural references==
Several books have explored Makah history, usually from the arrival of white settlers onward. The historical-adventure novel &quot;When Wolf Comes&quot; (2009) by John Pappas gives a glimpse into the lives of the Makah people of 1801. Young adult book &quot;Ghost Canoe&quot; (1998) by Will Hobbs takes place on and near the reservation, while &quot;Indian Days at Neah Bay&quot; by James G. McCurdy details life in Neah Bay in the early days of mandatory schooling from the perspective of the schoolteacher&#x27;s son. The children&#x27;s book &quot;Written in Stone&quot; (2014) by Rosanne Parry takes place in the 1920s, featuring an orphaned Makah girl who works to preserve her people&#x27;s culture. Meanwhile, Arlyn Conly&#x27;s memoir &quot;Never Trust a White Man&quot; takes place in the late 1950s, describing Neah Bay High School through the eyes of a white home economics teacher. French writer Frédéric Roux&#x27;s novel &quot;L&#x27;hiver indien&quot; (2007) (&quot;Indian Winter&quot;, éditions Grasset &amp; Fasquelle) explores the struggle between tradition and modernity for the Makah in northwestern Washington. In the realm of non-fiction, &quot;Voices of a Thousand People&quot; (2002) by Patricia Pierce Erikson with Helma Ward &amp; Kirk Wachendorf recounts the founding of The Makah Cultural and Research Center and the work to preserve their heritage.

Beyond books, the final scene of Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Dead Man&quot; takes place in a reconstructed Makah village. Many of the actors featured in the scene are Makah tribal members; dialogue is in the Makah language. Additionally, the song &quot;The Renegade&quot; by Ian and Sylvia recounts conflict in the life of the son of a &quot;Makah mother who marries a white man&quot; though the original lyric is &quot;klahowya&quot;, a greeting in Chinook Wawa, a widely-used trade language of the Pacific Northwest

<doc id="311673" wikidata="Q1107195" url="?curid=311673" title="Coil (band)">
<text>Coil were an English experimental music group formed in 1982 in London and dissolved in 2005. Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner and Psychic TV bandmate Peter Christopherson (formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle). Coil&#x27;s work explored themes related to the occult, sexuality, alchemy, and drugs while influencing genres such as gothic rock, neofolk and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group &quot;one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial scene.&quot;

After the release of their 1984 debut EP &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot;, Coil joined Some Bizzare Records, through which they released two full-length albums, &quot;Scatology&quot; (1985) and &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; (1986). In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, among them the rejected score for the first &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film. After departing from Some Bizzare, Coil established their own record label, Threshold House, through which they produced and released &quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot; (1991). Financial difficulties slowed the group&#x27;s work in the early 1990s before they returned to the project on releases such as &quot;Astral Disaster&quot; (1999), and the &quot;Musick to Play in the Dark&quot; series composed of &quot;Vol. 1&quot; (1999) and &quot;Vol. 2&quot; (2000), as well as releasing several projects under aliases such as Black Light District, ELpH, and Time Machines.

Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band&#x27;s career included Stephen Thrower, Danny Hyde, Drew McDowall, William Breeze, Thighpaulsandra and Ossian Brown. With involvement from these members, the group also started several smaller independent vanity labels, including Eskaton and Chalice. The group&#x27;s first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004. Following the accidental death of John Balance on 13 November 2004, Christopherson formally announced that Coil as a creative entity had ceased to exist, ending the Coil discography with &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot; (2005). Posthumous releases and compilations of unreleased material have since followed this. Christopherson died in 2010.

==History==
===1982–1983: Formation and early years===

In 1978, John Balance (born Geoff[rey] Burton; also known as Rushton, his stepfather&#x27;s surname) was a teenage zine journalist, writing—along with his schoolmate Tom Craig, a grandson of Edward Carrick and great-grandson of Edward Gordon Craig—under a moniker &quot;Stabmental&quot;, through which he published articles on UK underground artists, including seminal industrial bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire. A Throbbing Gristle fan, Balance had contacted them via mail, and thus befriended the Throbbing Gristle frontperson Genesis P-Orridge. In February 1980, Balance had attended a Throbbing Gristle gig recorded and released as &quot;Heathen Earth&quot;, where he had first met P-Orridge&#x27;s bandmate Peter Christopherson and befriended him as well.

Following the dissolution of Throbbing Gristle in 1981, P-Orridge, Christopherson, and Alex Fergusson (formerly of Alternative TV) went on to form the new project, titled Psychic TV, along with the accompanying fellowship titled Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Balance, who had attended the University of Sussex for a short time and participated in Brian Williams&#x27; Lustmord project, returned in London to live with Christopherson—with whom a romantic partnership had begun. As a Psychic TV member, Balance participated in the recording of the single &quot;Just Drifting&quot; (from the album &quot;Force the Hand of Chance&quot;) and, the following year, of the album &quot;Dreams Less Sweet&quot;.

Already having an experience of performing and recording previous to his tenure in Psychic TV, Balance went on to use the name Coil in 1982, originally envisioned for a solo project. In 1983, Balance wrote a manifesto titled &quot;The Price of Existence Is Eternal Warfare&quot; and sent a tape of the song &quot;On Balance&quot;, dated 5 May 1982, to Gary Levermore&#x27;s label Third Mind Records for an inclusion on a compilation album &quot;Rising From The Red Sand&quot;; Levermore, however, had rejected the track. Despite this, Balance had recorded three more new tracks—&quot;S for Sleep&quot;, &quot;Red Weather&quot;, and &quot;Here to Here (Double-Headed Secret)&quot;—on 11 May 1983. On 4 August 1983, Coil—as the duo of Balance and Christopherson—had played its first gig in London at the Magenta Club, during a screening of films by Cerith Wyn Evans and Derek Jarman. Since Christopherson&#x27;s commitments for Psychic TV—in which he had become disillusioned due to growing conflict with P-Orridge—still limited his participation in Coil, Balance approached John Gosling—also Psychic TV member who fronted his own project Zos Kia—to work with. Balance&#x27;s and Gosling&#x27;s collaboration resulted in the next three gigs during 1983, with the last one being performed in December on Berlin Atonal festival, where Balance participated as both Psychic TV and Coil member. The recordings from aforementioned gigs, as well as &quot;On Balance&quot;, were later included on Zos Kia/Coil split album &quot;Transparent&quot;, released in February 1984 by Austrian label Nekrophile Records. Since January 1984, Balance and Christopherson had departed from Psychic TV and the Temple of Psychic Youth, in order to make Coil as a full-time concern.

===1984–1986: &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot; and Some Bizzare years===
The band&#x27;s official recording debut, an extended play titled &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot;, was released on the Good Friday (20 April) of 1984 by a Belgian-based label L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords. Recorded on 19 February 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, the album was dedicated to Mars as the god of spring and war, using predominantly iron and steel instruments.

Shortly after in May 1984, Coil went on to record their first full-length studio album, eventually titled &quot;Scatology&quot;, approaching JG Thirlwell as a co-producer and co-composer; several others contributors, including Stephen Thrower, Alex Fergusson and Gavin Friday, took part in its recording. &quot;Scatology&quot;&#x27;s themes echoed those of &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot;, while focusing mainly on alchemy as an idea of transforming matter.

&quot;Scatology&quot; was released in early 1985 with a 1984 copyright date by the band&#x27;s own label, Force &amp; Form, and K.422 (a Some Bizzare Records sublabel), to mainly positive feedback. Shortly after, a single featuring a remix of &quot;Panic&quot; and a cover of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; was released, with the profits being donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust; hailed since then as the first AIDS benefit music release, it was supported with the &quot;Tainted Love&quot; video directed by Christopherson, which was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art in New York, U.S.
&quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; followed in 1986 as the next full-length release. Although songs such as &quot;The Anal Staircase&quot; and &quot;Circles of Mania&quot; sound like evolved versions of &quot;Scatology&quot; material, the album is characterized by slower tempos, and represented a new direction for the group. The album has a darker theme than previous releases, according to Balance:
Horse Rotorvator was this vision I&#x27;d had of this mechanical/flesh thing that ploughed up the earth and I really did have a vision of it—a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night ... The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse killed their horses and use their jawbones to make this huge earth-moving machine.&quot;

The artwork features a photograph of the location of a notorious IRA bombing, in which a bomb was detonated on a military orchestra pavilion. &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; was in part influenced by the AIDS-related deaths of some of their friends. Furthermore, the song &quot;Ostia (The Death of Pasolini)&quot; is about the mysterious death of Pier Paolo Pasolini, as well as what Balance described as &quot;the number one suicide spot in the world&quot;, the white cliffs of Dover.

===&quot;Gold Is the Metal...&quot; and &quot;Unnatural History&quot; (1986–1990)===
After the release of &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot;, Coil left Some Bizzare Records, since they fell out with its owner Stevo Pearce. &quot;Gold Is the Metal (With the Broadest Shoulders)&quot; followed as a full-length release in 1987, marking the beginning of the band&#x27;s own label, Threshold House—the album is described in the liner notes as &quot;not the follow-up to &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot;, but a completely separate package – a stopgap and a breathing space – the space between two twins&quot;, which refers to &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot;.

The 13-track &quot;Unnatural History&quot; compilation was then released on Threshold House in 1990. The first three songs on the album were first released as one half of the &quot;Nightmare Culture&quot; mini-album.

===&quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot; (1991–1992)===
&quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot; (abbreviated &quot;LSD&quot;) followed in 1991 as the next &quot;proper&quot; Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot;. &quot;LSD&quot; represents a progression in Coil&#x27;s style and became a template for what would be representative of newer waves of post-industrial music, blended with their own style of acid house. Although the album was more upbeat, it was not intended as a dance record, as Christopherson explained &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a party atmosphere, but it&#x27;s more positive.&quot; &quot;Windowpane&quot; and a Jack Dangers remix of &quot;The Snow&quot; were released as singles, both of which had music videos directed by Christopherson. The video for &quot;Windowpane&quot; was shot in the Golden Triangle, where, Balance claimed, &quot;the original Thai and Burmese drug barons used to exchange opium for gold bars with the CIA.&quot; Christopherson recalled &quot;John [Balance] discovered while he was performing that where he was standing was quicksand! In the video you can actually see him getting deeper and deeper.&quot; Furthermore, Thai friends of the group commented that they had known of several people that died where Coil had shot footage for the music video.

A music video for the song &quot;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&quot; was also shot, which was initially unreleased due to its nature: as Christopherson explained, &quot;We shot &#x27;Love&#x27;s Secret Domain&#x27; in a go-go boy bar in Bangkok; with John [Balance] performing on stage with about 20 or 30 dancing boys, which probably won&#x27;t get played on MTV, in fact!&quot; As of January 2015, the music video is viewable on more than one YouTube channel. &quot;Stolen &amp; Contaminated Songs&quot; followed as a full-length release in 1992. However, as with &quot;Gold Is the Metal...&quot;, it is a collection of outtakes and demos from the &quot;LSD&quot; era.

===Soundtracks and side projects (1993–1998)===
Coil separated their works into many side projects, publishing music under different names and a variety of styles. The pre-Coil aliases, Zos Kia and Sickness of Snakes, formed the foundation of a style that would evolve to characterize their initial wave of releases.

Before embarking on their second wave of side projects and pseudonyms, Coil created a soundtrack for the movie &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, although they withdrew from the project when they suspected their music would not be used. Furthermore, Coil claimed inspiration for Pinhead was partly drawn from the piercing magazines that director Barker borrowed from the group. Balance explained after the release of &quot;Stolen and Contaminated Songs&quot;, in around 1992:
Yeah it would have been brilliant but we wouldn&#x27;t have carried on, because they were changing everything and they weren&#x27;t being very nice to us, the actual film people. They were keeping us in the dark a lot. We said we&#x27;d had enough just at the same time they decided they wanted to use Howard Shore. They just wanted normal film music. They didn&#x27;t want anything too scary which is sad and ridiculous for a horror film.

Also in 1992, Threshold House released a &quot;Remixes And Re-Recordings&quot; version of &quot;How to Destroy Angels&quot;. Nurse with Wound&#x27;s Steven Stapleton contributed a remix of the song, &quot;How To Destroy Angels II&quot;.

In 1993, Coil contributed music to Derek Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;Blue&quot;. Their 1985 score for Jarman&#x27;s &quot;The Angelic Conversation&quot; was released on CD in 1994. In addition, they recorded soundtracks for the documentary &quot;Gay Man&#x27;s Guide to Safer Sex&quot; as well as &quot;Sarah Dales Sensuous Massage&quot;.

Much like the pre-Coil aliases, Coil&#x27;s series of side projects represented a diverse basis from which the group evolved a different style of sound. While &quot;Nasa Arab&quot;—credited to the group&#x27;s project &quot;The Eskaton&quot;—was Coil&#x27;s farewell to the acid house genre, the following projects, ELpH, Black Light District, and Time Machines, were all based heavily on experimentation with drone, an ingredient that would define Coil&#x27;s following work. These releases also launched the start of Coil&#x27;s new label Eskaton.

&quot;Transparent&quot; was reissued in CD format in 1997 on Threshold House. A disc and booklet were packaged in a &quot;thick&quot; slipcase, which was released
in partnership with the World Serpent music company.

===Late Coil (1998–2004)===
After the wave of experimental side projects, Coil&#x27;s sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations &quot;Unnatural History II&quot;, &quot;Windowpane &amp; The Snow&quot; and &quot;Unnatural History III&quot;. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed to coincide with the equinox and solstices of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation. The first single, &quot;Spring Equinox: Moon&#x27;s Milk or Under an Unquiet Skull&quot;, featured two versions of the same song, the second version of which included an electric viola contribution from a newly inducted member, William Breeze. The second single, &quot;Summer Solstice: Bee Stings&quot;, also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the industrial-noise song &quot;A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)&quot;, which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson&#x27;s who had committed suicide earlier that year. The third single, &quot;Autumn Equinox: Amethyst Deceivers&quot;, includes the track &quot;Rosa Decidua&quot;, which features vocals by Rose McDowall. The single also features the song &quot;Amethyst Deceivers&quot;, later reworked and performed throughout most of Coil&#x27;s tour—it was eventually re-made into an alternate version on the LP &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot;. The fourth single, &quot;Winter Solstice: North&quot;, also includes a track sung by McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project Rosa Mundi. The series would later be re-released as the double-CD set, &quot;Moon&#x27;s Milk (In Four Phases)&quot;.

&quot;Astral Disaster&quot; was created with the assistance from new band member Thighpaulsandra, and was released in January 1999 via Sun Dial member Gary Ramon&#x27;s label, Prescription. Although the album was initially limited to just 99 copies, it would later be re-released in a substantially different form. &quot;Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1&quot; followed in September 1999, and a few months later Coil performed their first concert in 16 years.

&quot;Queens Of The Circulating Library&quot; followed in April 2000, with production credit given to Thighpaulsandra. The single-track, full-length drone album is the only Coil release made without the assistance of Christopherson. &quot;Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2&quot; followed in September 2000, and Coil began to perform live more intensively, a period that also included writing the music for &quot;Black Antlers&quot; in between a series of mini-tours. Coil also released a series of live albums around this time. &quot;Constant Shallowness Leads To Evil&quot;, a noise-driven experimental album reminiscent of Christopherson&#x27;s work with Throbbing Gristle, was first sold at a live performance in September 2000. Coil finally released &quot;Black Antlers&quot; in June 2004.

In contrast to many of their earlier releases, Coil&#x27;s later material is characterized by a slower sound which relies more on drone than acid house. This change in sound was reflected in their live performances, as songs like &quot;Ostia&quot; and &quot;Slur&quot; were slowed down from their original pace, as well as re-recordings of &quot;Teenage Lightning&quot; and &quot;Amethyst Deceivers&quot; that were later released on &quot;The Ape Of Naples&quot;.

===Coil Live===
Coil&#x27;s live incarnation is associated with a distinct legacy. The first live shows took place in 1983, but after only four performances, 15 years would pass before they would play live again.

On 14 December 1999, Coil performed &quot;elph.zwölf&quot; at Volksbuehne in Berlin. Although the performance lasted just under 18 minutes, it marked the beginning of a new era of live performances. Coil would go on to perform close to 50 additional concerts, with varied set lists as well as performers.

Coil performed twice at the Royal Festival Hall in 2000. The first concert was in April, as part of a weekend curated by Julian Cope, when they first performed as the full band line-up – and wearing the &quot;fluffy suits&quot; that would become a staple of live performances for the first time – performing &quot;Time Machines&quot;. They performed again in September, sharing a bill with Jim Thirlwell (as Foetus) on that occasion. Both performances were full sets.

Coil&#x27;s performances were surrealistic visually and audibly. The signature fluffy suits, an idea inspired by Sun Ra, played a foremost role at the live shows. The suits would later be used as album covers for the release &quot;Live One&quot;, while other costumes appear on the covers of &quot;Live Two&quot; and &quot;Live Three&quot;—straitjacket and mirror-chested hooded jumpsuit, respectively. Video screens projected footage and animations created by Christopherson, while fog machines created an eerie atmosphere. Balance would often screech and howl during performances, which would add to the effect.

The band&#x27;s performance at the 2003 All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival was released as &quot;...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms&quot;. Released on Threshold House in 2005 as a digipak, a Thai version was released the following year. &quot;...And the Ambulance Died in His Arms&quot; was released under a name chosen by Balance before his death in November 2004.

Many Coil performances were released, including the widely available releases of &quot;Live Four&quot;, &quot;Live Three&quot;, &quot;Live Two&quot;, &quot;Live One&quot; and &quot;...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms&quot;, as well as several very limited editions, such as &quot;Selvaggina, Go Back Into The Woods&quot; and &quot;Megalithomania!&quot;. Video recordings of several concerts were released on the DVD box set, &quot;Colour Sound Oblivion&quot;, in 2010.

Coil&#x27;s final performance was on 23 October 2004, at DEAF (Dublin Electronic Arts Festival), Dublin City Hall in Ireland.

===Deaths of Balance and Christopherson===
Balance died on 13 November 2004, after he fell from a second-floor landing in his home. Christopherson announced Balance&#x27;s death on the Threshold House website, and provided details of the circumstances of the death. Balance&#x27;s memorial service was held near Bristol on 23 November 2004, and was attended by approximately 100 people.

The final studio album, &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot;, was released on 2 December 2005. In August 2006, the rare CD-R releases &quot;The Remote Viewer&quot; and &quot;Black Antlers&quot; were &quot;sympathetically remastered&quot; and expanded into two-disc versions, which included new and recently remixed material. A comprehensive 16-DVD boxset, titled &quot;Colour Sound Oblivion&quot;, was released in July 2010. A &quot;Patron Edition&quot; was pre-orderable in November 2009 and sold out in three hours. Christopherson also discussed the possibility of releasing Coil&#x27;s entire back catalogue on a single Blu-ray disc.

In November 2006, the official Coil website posted the following announcement: &quot;Following the success of Thai pressings of &quot;The Remote Viewer&quot; and &quot;Black Antlers&quot;, and after many requests, we are planning to expand the CD catalog still further.&quot; A few days later &quot;Duplais Balance&quot; and &quot;Moon&#x27;s Milk in Six Phases&quot; were announced. Furthermore, an expanded vinyl version of &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot;, which includes the album &quot;The New Backwards&quot;, has been released, and a two-disc version of &quot;Time Machines&quot; has been announced.

Six years after the death of Balance, Christopherson died in his sleep on 24 November 2010 in Bangkok, Thailand.

==Artistry==
===Style, instruments and creative methods===
While their work became increasingly difficult to describe as their career progressed, Coil&#x27;s musical style encompassed genres such as industrial music, noise music, ambient music and dark ambient, neofolk, spoken word, drone music and minimalism. They often considered their works more as magical rituals than as musical pieces; Balance explicitly referred to this approach as &quot;magickal music&quot;. Balance described the first half of the Coil discography as &quot;solar&quot; and their later work as &quot;moon musick&quot;.

Coil incorporated many exotic and rare instruments into their recordings and performances. The group expressed particular interest in vintage electronic instruments including the Moog synthesizer, the ANS synthesizer, the Mellotron and the Optigan. During Coil&#x27;s later period, marimba player Tom Edwards joined the group, and performed on the live albums &quot;Live Two&quot; and &quot;Live Three&quot;, as well as on the studio albums &quot;Black Antlers&quot; and &quot;The Ape of Naples&quot;.

Often ensuing from improvisation and intuition, Coil utilized experimental techniques such as the cut-up technique, ritual drug use, sleep deprivation, lucid dreaming, tidal shifts, John Dee-like methods of scrying, technical glitches, SETI synchronization and chaos theory.

===Releases===
Coil&#x27;s distribution sometimes included releasing limited editions of albums, thereby making them collectors&#x27; items among fans. Including quirks such as &quot;art objects&quot;, sigil-like autographs and even stains of blood in the packaging of their albums, Coil claimed that this made their work more personal for true fans, turning their records into something akin to occult artifacts. This practice was markedly increased in the later half of Coil&#x27;s career. Due to this, critics accused Coil and its record company of price gouging. However, Balance expressed interest in having regular Coil albums in every shop that wanted them. In 2003, Coil began re-releasing many rare works, mostly remixed. They also launched a download service, where a large amount of their out-of-print music was made available.

===Religious views===
Coil held pagan and alchemical beliefs, as well as a fixation on chaos magic, but were sometimes labelled as Satanic. Balance explicitly referred to himself as a &quot;Born Again Pagan&quot;, and described his paganism as a &quot;spirituality within nature.&quot; Christopherson, however, described the beliefs of Coil as unassociated:

We don&#x27;t follow any particular religious dogma. In fact, quite the reverse, we tend to discourage the following of dogmas, or false prophets, as it were. And we don&#x27;t have a very sympathetic view of Christians up to this point. The thing we follow is our own noses; I don&#x27;t mean in a chemical sense.

==Influences and legacy==
Although Coil expressed interest in many musical groups, they rarely, if ever, claimed to be influenced by them. Coil explicitly stated the influence of such non-musical sources as William Burroughs, Aleister Crowley, Brion Gysin and Austin Spare. Furthermore, the group were friends with Burroughs and owned some of Spare&#x27;s original artwork.

Balance encouraged fans to trade, discuss and discover new and different forms of music, stressing the importance of variety. Music that Coil expressed interest in is diverse and wide-ranging, from musique concrète to folk music to hardcore punk to classical to techno. Among the musicians Coil expressed interest in were early electronic, experimental and minimalist artists: Harry Partch, La Monte Young, Karlheinz Stockhausen (once referred to by Balance as &quot;an honorary member of Coil&quot;), Alvin Lucier, and Arvo Pärt. Coil also expressed interest in krautrock groups including Cluster, Amon Düül II, Can, Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream. Rock musicians and groups Coil have expressed interest in are: Angus Maclise, Captain Beefheart, Flipper, Leonard Cohen, Lou Reed, Nico, Pere Ubu, Butthole Surfers, Napalm Death, The Birthday Party, The Velvet Underground and The Virgin Prunes. Coil expressed an interest in the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and used a sample from his ballet &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; on the &quot;Horse Rotorvator&quot; song &quot;The Anal Staircase&quot;. Furthermore, on the album &quot;Black Antlers&quot; Coil dedicated a song to Sun Ra and covered a song by Bam Bam.

Coil&#x27;s influence on electronic music has become more evident since the death of Balance, with electronic musicians from all over the world collaborating on a series of tribute albums. Some notable artists who appear on these albums are Alec Empire, Chris Connelly and KK Null (see &quot;...It Just Is&quot;). Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor also expressed the significant influence that the group had on his work in February 2014:
[Coil&#x27;s] &#x27;Tainted Love&#x27; video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it&#x27;s not immediately obvious: Horse Rotorvator was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.

The track &quot;At the Heart of It All&quot; (found on &quot;Scatology&quot;) later lent its name to an Aphex Twin track on the Nine Inch Nails remix album &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot;; Coil also provided remixes for &quot;Further Down the Spiral&quot; as well as &quot;Gave Up&quot; on the remix album &quot;Fixed&quot;. Furthermore, in 2010, Reznor, Mariqueen Maandig and Atticus Ross started a new band called How to Destroy Angels—named after the Coil song—which received Christopherson&#x27;s blessing after Reznor made contact with him.

<text>Ellesmere Port ( ) is a port town in the Cheshire West and Chester borough in Cheshire, England. Ellesmere Port is on the south-eastern edge of the Wirral Peninsula, north of Chester, on the bank of the Manchester Ship Canal. In the 2021 census, the built up area had a population of 65,430.

The town was originally established on the River Mersey at the entrance to the Ellesmere Canal. As well as a service sector economy, it has retained large industries including Stanlow oil refinery, a chemical works and the Vauxhall Motors car factory. There are also a number of tourist attractions including the National Waterways Museum, the Blue Planet Aquarium and Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet.

==History==

The town of Ellesmere Port was founded at the outlet of the never-completed Ellesmere Canal, named after the town of Ellesmere, Shropshire. The canal (now renamed) was designed and engineered by William Jessop and Thomas Telford as part of a project to connect the rivers Severn, Mersey and Dee. The canal was intended to be completed in sections. In 1795 the section between the River Mersey and the River Dee at Chester was opened. However the canal was not finished as first intended; it never reached the River Severn. Upon re-evaluation, it was decided that the costs to complete the project were not projected to be repaid because of a decrease in expected commercial traffic. There had been a loss of competitive advantage caused by steam engine-related economic advances (nationally, regionally and locally) during the first decade of the canal&#x27;s construction.

The 1793 act authorising the canal&#x27;s construction referred to its connection to the Mersey being &quot;at or near Netherpool&quot;. In the event, the canal&#x27;s northern end was not built in the township of Netherpool, but in the neighbouring township of Whitby to the east. The settlement which grew up at the canal basin was known both as &#x27;Ellesmere Port&#x27; and &#x27;Whitby Locks&#x27; at first.

Settlements had existed in the area since the writing of the Domesday Book in the 11th century, which mentions Great Sutton, Little Sutton, Pool (now Overpool) and Hooton.

The first houses in Ellesmere Port itself, however, grew up around the docks and the first main street was Dock Street, which now houses the National Waterways Museum. Station Road, which connected the docks with the village of Whitby, also gradually developed and as more shops were needed, some of the houses became retail premises. The main employer at this time was Burnell&#x27;s Iron Works which had been set up at the end of the nineteenth century. This was followed by the setting up of the Mersey Ironworks factory by the Wolverhampton Corrugated Iron Company In 1905 who settled on Ellesmere Port as a way of exploiting the company&#x27;s international trade through the nearby ports of Birkenhead and Liverpool. Initially 300 workers and their families came from Wolverhampton and the surrounding areas to work in the factory, settling in a specially built worker&#x27;s village named “Wolverham”. As the expanding industrial areas growing up around the canal and its docks attracted more workers to the area, the town itself continued to expand.

By the mid-20th century, thanks to the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 and the Stanlow Oil Refinery in the 1920s, Ellesmere Port had expanded so that it now incorporated the villages of Great and Little Sutton, Hooton, Whitby, Overpool and Rivacre as suburbs. The town centre itself had moved from the Station Road/Dock Street area, to an area that had once been home to a stud farm (indeed, the former Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council officially referred to the town centre as Stud Farm for housing allocation purposes) around the crossroads of Sutton Way/Stanney Lane and Whitby Road.

The foundation stone for Ellesmere Port Civic Hall was laid by the Chairman of Ellesmere Port Borough Council, Horace Black, on 2 May 1953. It was designed in the modernist style and completed in 1955. The Ellesmere Port Council Offices were constructed just to the southwest of the civic hall and completed in 1969.

In the 20th century, a number of new housing estates were developed, many of them on the sites of former farms such as Hope Farm and Grange Farm. Many estates consisted of both council housing and privately owned houses and flats.

Ellesmere Port, in more recent times has had an influx of immigrants from Liverpool. Thus demand for housing increased with the opening of the Vauxhall Motors car plant in 1962. Opened as a components supplier to the Luton plant, passenger car production began in 1964 with the Vauxhall Viva. The plant is now Vauxhall&#x27;s only car factory in Britain, since the end of passenger car production at the Luton plant in 2004 (where commercial vehicles are still made). Ellesmere Port currently produces the Vauxhall Astra model on two shifts, employing 2,500 people.

In the mid-1980s, the Port Arcades, a covered shopping mall was built in the town centre. By the 1990s, it was the retail sector rather than the industrial that was attracting workers and their families to the town. This was boosted with the building of the Cheshire Oaks outlet village and the Coliseum shopping park, which also included a multiplex cinema; prior to this since the closure of the cinema in Station Road, Little Sutton (King&#x27;s cinema) and the Queen&#x27;s cinema adjacent to Ellesmere Port railway station in the 1960s the town&#x27;s only cinema had been a single screen in the EPIC Leisure Centre.

In August 2012, Marks &amp; Spencer opened their largest store (apart from Marble Arch in London) on a site near the Coliseum shopping park.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Ellesmere Port, at unitary authority level, being Cheshire West and Chester Council. Most of the Ellesmere Port built up area is unparished, with the exception of the civil parish of Little Stanney on the south-eastern edge of the urban area. Cheshire West and Chester Council has its main offices in the town, at the Portal on Wellington Road.

===Parliamentary representation===
At national level, Ellesmere Port is part of the Ellesmere Port and Bromborough constituency. , the constituency is represented by Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Justin Madders.

===Administrative history===
The site where Ellesmere Port was developed from the 1790s onwards lay within the township of Whitby. The township was mostly in the ancient parish of Eastham but partly in the parish of Stoke (now called Stoak). Both parishes formed part of the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. Whitby village lay about inland from the port, close to where the modern town centre later developed. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Whitby, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parishes as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Whitby became a civil parish.

The parish of Whitby was converted into an urban district called Ellesmere Port and Whitby in 1902. The urban district was enlarged in 1910 to absorb the parishes of Netherpool, Overpool, Great Stanney, and Stanlow. In 1911, the civil parishes within the urban district were reorganised into two urban parishes: Ellesmere Port (covering the area of the abolished parishes of Netherpool, Overpool and Whitby), and Great Stanney, which absorbed the area of the abolished parish of Stanlow.

The urban district was enlarged again in 1933 to take in the parishes of Childer Thornton, Hooton, Ince, Great Sutton, and Little Sutton, with some adjustments to the boundaries with neighbouring parishes. The enlarged urban district was renamed from Ellesmere Port and Whitby to just Ellesmere Port at the same time. The parish of Ellesmere Port was enlarged to cover the whole urban district in 1950, and in 1955 the urban district was raised to the status of a municipal borough.
The borough of Ellesmere Port was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area had been considered for inclusion in the new county of Merseyside, but it was decided instead to leave it in Cheshire as part of the new borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston. Ellesmere Port was the largest town in the new borough, and was where the new borough council established its headquarters, using the former borough council&#x27;s offices on Civic Way as its headquarters.

Ellesmere Port and Neston Borough Council was abolished in 2009, when local government across Cheshire was reorganised; Cheshire County Council was also abolished, and the three districts of Chester, Ellesmere Port and Neston, and Vale Royal merged to become Cheshire West and Chester. The Cheshire West and Chester councillors representing the wards which cover Ellesmere Port act as charter trustees to preserve the town&#x27;s civic traditions, including choosing one of their number to serve as the town&#x27;s mayor.

<doc id="311678" wikidata="Q785925" url="?curid=311678" title="Gerardus Vossius">
<text>Gerrit Janszoon Vos (March or April 1577, Heidelberg – 19 March 1649, Amsterdam), often known by his Latin name Gerardus Vossius, was a Dutch classical scholar, theologian, and polymath.

==Life==
He was the son of Johannes (Jan) Vos, a Protestant from the Netherlands, who fled from persecution into the Electorate of the Palatinate and briefly became pastor in the village near Heidelberg where Gerardus (the Latinized form of &quot;Gerrit&quot;) was born, before friction with the strict Lutherans of the Palatinate caused him to settle the following year at the University of Leiden as student of theology, and finally became pastor at Dordrecht, where he died in 1585. Here in Dordrecht the son received his education, until in 1595 he entered the University of Leiden, where he became the lifelong friend of Hugo Grotius, and studied classics, Hebrew, church history and theology.

In 1600 he was made rector of the Latin school in Dordrecht, and devoted himself to philology and historical theology. From 1614 to 1619 he was director of the theological college at Leiden University.

In the meantime, he was gaining a great reputation as a scholar, not only in the Netherlands, but also in France and England. But in spite of the moderation of his views and his abstention from controversy, he came under suspicion of heresy, and escaped expulsion from his office only by resignation (1619). The year before he had published his &quot;Historia Pelagiana&quot;, a history of the Pelagian controversies; at the time it was considered by some to favour the views of the Arminians or Remonstrants.

In 1622, he was appointed professor of rhetoric and chronology, and subsequently of Greek, in the university. He had many contacts in England; he declined invitations from Cambridge, but accepted from Archbishop Laud a prebend in Canterbury Cathedral without residence, and went to England to be installed in 1629, when he was made LL.D. at Oxford. He was on intimate terms with Thomas Farnaby, and Farnaby&#x27;s &quot;Latin Grammar&quot; is based to a certain extent upon that which Vossius wrote for the Elzevir press in 1629. Among his other English correspondents were Brian Duppa, Dudley Carleton, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the prelates James Ussher and Richard Sterne, and Christopher Wren.
He got permission from Charles I to return to the Low Countries. In 1632 he left Leiden to take the post of professor of history in the newly founded Athenaeum Illustre at Amsterdam, which he held until his death.

==Family==
His son Isaac (1618–1689), after a career of scholarship in Sweden, became residentiary canon at Windsor in 1673. He was the author of &quot;De septuaginta interpretibus&quot; (1661), &quot;De poematum cantu et viribus rhythmi&quot; (1673), and &quot;Variarum observationum liber&quot; (1685).

Others:
*His son Dionysius Vossius died 1633 or 1640. He made notes on the work of Moses Maimonides.
*His third son Gerrit Vossius died 1640. He was an editor of Velleius Paterculus (1639).
*His son Matthew died 1646. He made a chronicle of Holland.
*Francis Vossius was Gerardus Vossius&#x27;s brother.

A person also called Gerardus Vossius, a Roman Catholic who made annotated Latin translations of Gregory Thaumaturgus and Cicero and died in Liège in 1609, was a distant relation.

==Works==
Vossius was amongst the first scholars to treat both Christian theological dogma and non-Christian religion from a scientific-historical, instead of a theological point of view. His principal works are: 
*&quot;Historiae de controversiis quas Pelagius eiusque reliquiae moverunt&quot; (1618)
*&quot;Aristarchus, sive de arte grammatica&quot; (1635 and 1695; new ed. in 2 vols., 1833–35)
*&quot;Etymologicum linguae Latinae&quot; (&quot;Etymology of the Latin Language&quot;; 1662; new ed. in two vols., 1762–63)
*&quot;Commentariorum Rhetoricorum oratoriarum institutionum Libri VI.&quot; (&quot;Essays on Rhetoric&quot;, or &quot;The Institutes of Oratory&quot;; 1606 and often)
*&quot;De Historicis Graecis Libri IV&quot; (&quot;The Greek Historians&quot;; 1624)
*&quot;De Historicis Latinis Libri III&quot; (&quot;The Latin Historians&quot;; 1627)
*&quot;Of Errors of Speech and Latino-Barbarous Terms&quot; (1640)
*&quot;De Theologia Gentili&quot; (1641)
*&quot;Dissertationes Tres de Tribus Symbolis, Apostolico, Athanasiano et Constantinopolitano&quot; (1642)
*&quot;The Times of the Ancient Poets&quot; (1654)
*&quot;Correspondence of Vossius with Eminent Men&quot;, (1691).
His collected works were published in Amsterdam (6 vols., 1695–1701).

In rhetoric, his works enjoyed a wide circulation and were used as textbooks. He supported Aristotle&#x27;s definitions, and opposed Ramism. While his major influences were Aristotle and Cicero, he also cited Hermogenes, Menander Rhetor, Bartholomeus Keckermann and Nicolas Caussin.

<text>The Nisqually are a Lushootseed-speaking Native American tribe in western Washington state in the United States. They are a Southern Coast Salish people. They are federally recognized as the Nisqually Indian Tribe, formerly known as the Nisqually Indian Tribe of the Nisqually Reservation and the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation.

The tribe lives on a reservation in the Nisqually River valley near the river delta. The Nisqually Indian Reservation, at , comprises 20.602 km2 (7.955 sq mi) of land area on both sides of the river, in western Pierce County and eastern Thurston County. In the 2000 census, it had a resident population of 588 persons, all in the Thurston County portion, on the southwest side of the Nisqually River.

The tribe moved onto their reservation east of Olympia, Washington, in late 1854 with the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty. As reaction to the unfairness of the treaty, many members of the tribe led by Chief Leschi engaged and were eventually defeated by the US Army in the conflict known as the Puget Sound War in 1855–56.

==Government==

On September 9, 1946, the tribe&#x27;s constitution and bylaws were approved. The constitution was amended in 1994. The governing body of the Tribe is the General Council comprising all enrolled tribal members 18 years of age or older. The day-to-day business and economic affairs of the tribe are overseen by a tribal council composed of seven tribal members elected by the tribe&#x27;s voting membership.

==Language==
The Nisqually speak a subdialect of the southern dialect of Lushootseed (called Twulshootseed), which is a Coast Salish language. In Lushootseed, their name is , meaning &quot;people of the grass.&quot;

==Country==
The Nisqually Indians originally inhabited the interior woodlands and coastal waters from Mount Rainier west to Puget Sound. The lifestyle of the Nisqually, like many other Northwest Coastal tribes, revolved around fishing for salmon. In 1917, Pierce County, through the process of condemnation proceedings (eminent domain), took for the Fort Lewis Military Reserve.

When building Ft. Lewis in 1917, the United States government wanted to control land for the project that rightfully belonged to the Nisqually people. The War Department negotiated a price of $25 per acre to be paid to the natives for the land the U.S. deemed necessary for the fort. The Nisqually people had neither the opportunity nor the funds to fight the government&#x27;s acquisition of their lands. When the war ended in 1918, the Nisqually people petitioned for their land to be returned to them, as the fort no longer needed to train troops for the war. The request was denied by Newton Baker, President Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of War. Cannon and artillery fire from the fort could be heard from the Nisqually reservation for the better part of the next century.

==History==

The Nisqually people have lived in the watershed for thousands of years. According to legend, the Squalli-absch (ancestors of the modern Nisqually Indian Tribe), came north from the Great Basin, crossed the Cascade Mountain Range and erected their first village in a basin now known as Skate Creek, just outside the Nisqually River Watershed&#x27;s southern boundary. Later, a major village would be located near the Mashel River.

The Nisqually have always been a fishing people. The salmon has not only been the mainstay of their diet, but the foundation of their culture as well. The Nisqually Tribe is the prime steward of the Nisqually River fisheries resources, and operate two fish hatcheries: one on Clear Creek and one on Kalama Creek.

The Nisqually Tribe is located on the Nisqually River in rural Thurston County, east of Olympia, Washington. As of the year 2005, the tribe had a service area population of 5,719 Native Americans, 600 of whom reside on the reservation. An additional 5,119 service population members live off the reservation in Thurston and Pierce Counties. Tribal land holdings, on and near the Nisqually reservation, exceed 1,000 acres (4 km2)—all of which has been reacquired since 1986.

The original reservation was established by the Medicine Creek Treaty of December 26, 1854. The reservation consisted of 1,280 acres (5.2 km2) on Puget Sound. On January 20, 1856, an executive order enlarged it to 4,717 acres (19.1 km2) on both sides of the Nisqually River.

On September 30, 1884, land was set aside and divided into one-family allotments on both sides of the Nisqually River. The land did not include the river. The people lived in peace for a while harvesting fish from the river and growing potatoes on the prairie tracts.

==Interactions Between European Settlers and the Nisqually People==
In the 1840s European settlers began to migrate into Nisqually territory. The numbers of settlers gradually grew and the 
Nisqually people were originally peaceful with the settlers until the actions of territorial governor Isaac Stevens in 1853. Stevens terminated Indian land rights and took millions of acres from native peoples and attempted to establish the Treaty of Medicine Creek with Chief Leschi of the Nisqually people. The treaty proposed was declined by Leschi due to the small amounts of land they would receive from it as well as the treaty requiring the Nisqually people to move away from Medicine creek to less livable and isolated shrubland. It is firmly believed by many that Stevens’ laws and actions in the war heavily influenced the retaliation of the Nisqually natives in the Puget Sound Indian war due to his mistreatment of the Native Nisqually and the middling and unsurvivable land he assigned them. After the Puget Sound Indian War had ceased, the native Nisqually tribesmen were assigned a new reservation back alongside the river but survival was still difficult due to the restricted sizes of their reservations as well as the U.S. military&#x27;s confiscation of 3,000 acres of their land for the creation of the Fort Lewis Military Reserve. Many Natives began to leave the reserves in search of better opportunities and homes elsewhere and from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1940s the US government controlled the education of Nisqually youth in attempts to assimilate them into white American culture.

==Cuisine==
Fish, both fresh and smoked, is an important staple in Nisqually cuisine, especially salmon, but also cod, eulachon, halibut, herring, sturgeon, and trout. Shellfish, deer, elk, and sea mammals were traditionally hunted for food. Camas, wild berries, crab apples, and other wild plants are traditionally gathered.

<text>Johann Jakob Herzog (12 September 1805 – 30 September 1882) was a Swiss-German Protestant theologian.

Herzog was born in Basel. Herzog studied theology at the University of Basel and Berlin, earning his doctorate at the University of Basel in 1830. In 1835-1846 he was a professor of historical theology at the Academy in Lausanne. Afterwards he served as a professor in Halle, and eventually (1854), he settled at Erlangen as a professor of church history.

Herzog is remembered for his writings on the history of the Reformation (Zwingli, John Calvin, Johannes Oecolampadius), and for his studies of the Waldensian Church.

Herzog was author of the &quot;Real-Encyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche&quot; (1853–1868, 22 volumes), of which a new edition, in collaboration with Gustav Leopold Plitt and Albert Hauck, was published from 1877 to 1888 (18 volumes). From 1896 to 1913, Hauck released a third edition of the encyclopedia (24 volumes; Vol 1–22, 1896–1909, with two later supplements). Based on the encyclopedia&#x27;s third edition, the &quot;New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge&quot; was subsequently published in English from 1908 to 1914 (13 volumes). He died in Erlangen.

<text>A machinist is a tradesperson or trained professional who operates machine tools, and has the ability to set up tools such as milling machines, grinders, lathes, and drilling machines.

A competent machinist should have a well-developed mechanical aptitude, the ability to correctly use precision measuring instruments and to interpret blueprints, and a working knowledge of the proper parameters required for successfully utilizing the various tools commonly used in machining operations. CNC (computer numerical control) is the modern manufacturing method in which machinist use a form of programming called G-code to make components for a wide variety of industries. CNC programming is a highly skilled position. Programmers are usually machinist as well. A CNC programmer creates programs using software called CAM (computer aided manufacturing). The programmer must be proficient in math, speeds and feeds, machine tooling, work holding, and the different ways various materials react to stress and heat in the machining process.

==Nature of work==
The machine trade is an extremely broad field with a wide variety of workplaces, job duties, and types of work. Most machinists work in machine shops and factories where they operate machinery that produce precision component parts. In general, the occupation is exacting, and requires extensive knowledge of the tools and processes in order to achieve the tight tolerances and surface finishes that these parts specify.

Many machinists make mass-produced parts using highly automated computer numerical control machines which are common today, but still require such professionals to set up and calibrate the machines. Other more specialised machinists produce custom-made parts for prototyping, repair, or research. A machinist may work on manufacturing something relatively simple like a bracket, or a shaft, or something extraordinarily complex, such as aerospace components accurate to 5 micrometres.

==Related occupational titles==
Some titles reflect further development of machinist skills such as tool and die maker, patternmaker, mold maker, programmer, and operator. A machinist is one who is called on to fix a problem with a part or to create a new one using metals, plastics, or rarely, wood. Depending on the company, a machinist can be any or all of the titles listed above.

Other related fields include Millwrights, quality assurance, and mechanical engineers.

In Australia, a related profession is a fitter and turner. A fitter and turner is the tradesperson who fits, assembles, grinds and shapes metal parts and subassemblies to fabricate production machines and other equipment.

Under the machinist title are other specialty titles that refer to specific skills that may be more highly developed to meet the needs of a particular job position, such as fitter (assembles parts), turning hand, mill hand, and grinder.

==Role in manufacturing==

A machinist is usually called upon when a part needs to be produced from a stock material by cutting. Such a part may be unique or may be needed in the thousands. The part could be anything made from metal or plastic, though machined parts are usually ones that require high precision and cannot be produced by other means. Machinists generally start with a saw cut length of stock or a casting. Producing a part will often require several steps and more than one machine tool. Each machine tool plays a specific role in cutting away excess material. When large numbers of parts are needed, production planning is required to plan the most logical workflow through a series of machines. Computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines are computer-driven tools that can machine a large variety of shapes, and whose use in the workflow depends on the part to be machined.

CNC machines are becoming the standard due to their speed, precision, flexibility, repeatability, and reduced downtime while changing jobs. Production runs consisting of large numbers of parts are more cost effective and commonly referred to as production work in the trade. Conversely, small production runs are sometimes referred to as prototype or jobbing work.

Production engineers use blueprints and engineering drawings to produce detailed specifications of the part, especially its geometry (shape), then decide on a strategy to make it. Machine tools are then configured by the machinist and production commences. The machinist works with the quality department to ensure the specifications are maintained in the finished product.

Large commercial organizations often staff machinists on site in a maintenance mode to ensure continuing operations of the production machinery. Such machinists can often make replacement parts the same day. Because of this, the labor cost for this role are significantly lower than costs involved with production shutdowns.

==Additive machining==
Additive machining means 3D printing to create industrial components, prototypes, tooling, and end-use production parts. Additive machining comes into its own in the manufacturing of very small intricate parts, which could not be produced through any other manufacturing process. There are several processes in additive manufacturing which include direct metal deposition: electron beam melting, fused filament fabrication, select laser sintering, and variations of them.

==Materials commonly encountered by machinists==
The most common materials that machinists make parts from are steel, aluminium, brass, copper, and various alloys of these materials. Other less common materials such as vanadium, zinc, lead, or manganese are often used as alloying elements for the most common materials. Materials that machinists work with occasionally are plastics, rubber, glass, and wood products. Rarely, machinists also work with exotic and refractory metals. The term exotic metals is a general term describing out of the ordinary, rare or special purpose metals. A synonym might be space-age. A list of exotic metals might include, but is not limited to, titanium, beryllium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten, as well as special high-temperature metal alloys like Inconel or Hastelloy (superalloys). Very often the meaning of the term suggests the need for specialized handling and/or tooling to machine them effectively.

While the foregoing were primarily the materials that a machinist would be cutting, the cutters that the machinist uses must be harder and tougher than the materials to be cut. The materials in the cutters a machinist uses are most commonly high-speed steel, tungsten carbide, ceramics, Borazon, and diamond.

Machinists usually work to very small tolerances, usually within 0.010&quot; or 0.25 mm (more commonly expressed as ±0.005&quot; (Plus or minus five thousandths of an inch) or ±0.13 mm), and sometimes at tolerances as low as +/-0.0001&quot; (plus or minus one tenth of a thousandth of an inch – or 0.0025 mm) for specialty operations. A machinist deals with all facets of shaping, cutting and some aspects of forming metal, although forming is typically a separate trade. The operations most commonly performed by machinists are milling, drilling, turning, and grinding. There are other more specialized operations that a machinist will less frequently be called upon to perform such as honing, keyseating, lapping, and polishing, to name a few.

==Tools of the machinist==

The tools that a machinist is expected to be proficient with fall into broad categories:

*Measuring tools: The measuring tools come in several basic varieties:
**Comparison tools such as adjustable parallels and plain calipers,
**Direct reading tools such as rules, scales, and vernier calipers, 
**Micrometer tools based on screw threads,
**Indicator tools based on clockwork gear movements,
**Electronic measuring tools based on transducers. Many of these are digital versions of their mechanical predecessors, as with a digital caliper.
**coordinate measuring machines, which plot cartesian points around the surfaces of a part to generate a digital model that can be compared against the CAD drawing 
**optical comparators, which magnify the silhouette of a part onto a screen so small features can be more easily inspected
**surface roughness testers, 
*Hand tools: The hand tools are the usual complement of tools found in a complete auto mechanic&#x27;s set except that auto specialty tools would be absent and some outsized tools would likely be present, such as 1 1/2&quot; (38 mm) open end wrench.
*Deburring tools: These are tools such as files, stones, die grinders, picks and blades used to remove burrs and break sharp edges often left on machined parts
*Machine tools: The machine tools have undergone a dramatic shift in the last 20 years. Manual machines have given way to computer numerically controlled machines (CNCs). For clarity&#x27;s sake a categorization based on the historical groupings will be offered. Each of these groupings has been altered by the advent of CNCs and the CNCs meld some groups and blur the lines between others. The most common machine tools fall into five categories:
**Drilling machines, bench, floor, radial, and horizontal
**Milling machines, horizontal, vertical, and boring mills, 4 and 5 axis mills 
**Turning machines, engine lathe, turret lathe, vertical turret lathe, vertical boring mill, Swiss lathe
**Grinding machines, surface, cylindrical, centerless, universal
**Electric Discharge Machines, wire, sinker,
*Work holders: The work holders may include vises, chucks, clamps, indexing accessories, pallets, specialty jigs or fixtures, and faceplates.
*Tool holders: The tool holders may include chucks, cutter adapters, cutter extensions, tool posts, indexable turrets, box tools, quick change adapters, arbors, shrink fit, and collets.
*Cutting tools: Cutting tools include various milling cutters such as face mills, shell mills, endmills, and form cutters; various drills, reamers, taps, countersinks, counterbores, and core drills; various turning tools, form tools, and threading tools; various grinding wheels distinguished by their geometry, bond, grit size, and compound.
*Charts and reference materials: such as tap drill charts, conversion charts, thread tolerance charts, ASME and ISO specifications, machine tool manuals, and tooling feeds and speeds charts.

<text>Washoe (1965 – October 30, 2007) was a female common chimpanzee who was the first non-human to learn to communicate using signs adapted from American Sign Language (ASL) as part of an animal research experiment on animal language acquisition.

Washoe learned approximately 350 signs of ASL, also teaching her adopted son Loulis some signs. She spent most of her life at Central Washington University.

==Early life==
Washoe was born in West Africa in 1965. She was captured for use by the US Air Force for research for the US space program. Washoe was named after Washoe County, Nevada, where she was raised and taught to use ASL.

In 1967, R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner established a project to teach Washoe ASL at the University of Nevada, Reno. At the time, previous attempts to teach chimpanzees to imitate vocal languages (the Gua and Viki projects) had failed. The Gardners believed that these projects were flawed because chimpanzees are physically unable to produce the voiced sounds required for oral language. Their solution was to utilize the chimpanzee&#x27;s ability to communicate through gesture, which is how they communicate in the wild, by starting a project based on American Sign Language. The Gardners raised Washoe as one would raise a child. She frequently wore clothes and sat with them at the dinner table. Washoe had her own 8-foot-by-24-foot trailer complete with living and cooking areas. The trailer had a couch, drawers, a refrigerator, and a bed with sheets and blankets. She had access to clothing, combs, toys, books, and a toothbrush. Much like a human child, she underwent a regular routine with chores, outdoor play, and rides in the family car. Upon seeing a swan, Washoe signed &quot;water&quot; and &quot;bird&quot;. Harvard psychologist Roger Brown said that &quot;was like getting an S.O.S. from outer space&quot;.

When Washoe was five, the Gardners moved on to other chimp projects, and returned her to the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Institute of Primate Studies in Norman, Oklahoma, under the care of Roger Fouts and Deborah Fouts.

==ASL instruction and usage==
===Teaching method===
Washoe was raised in an environment as close as possible to that of a human child, in an attempt to satisfy her psychological need for companionship.

While with Washoe, the Gardners and Foutses communicated exclusively in ASL, avoiding vocal communication, on the assumption that this would create a less confusing learning environment for Washoe. This technique was said to resemble that used when teaching human children language.

After the first couple of years of the language project, the Gardners and Roger Fouts discovered that Washoe could pick up ASL gestures without direct instruction; she learned by observing humans around her who were signing amongst themselves. For example, the scientists signed &quot;toothbrush&quot; to each other while they brushed their teeth near her. At the time of observation, Washoe showed no signs of having learned the sign, but later reacted to the sight of a toothbrush by spontaneously producing the correct sign. Moreover, the Gardners began to realize that rewarding particular signs with food and tickles—the approach used in operant conditioning—interfered with the learning process. Instead, they set up a conversational environment that evoked communication, without the use of rewards for specific actions.

===Confirmed signs===
Washoe learned approximately 350 signs. For researchers to consider that Washoe had learned a sign, she had to use it spontaneously and appropriately for 14 consecutive days.

These signs were then further tested using a double-blind vocabulary test. This test demonstrated 1) &quot;that the chimpanzee subjects could communicate information under conditions in which the only source of information available to a human observer was the signing of the chimpanzee;&quot; 2) &quot;that independent observers agreed with each other;&quot; and 3) &quot;that the chimpanzees used the signs to refer to natural language categories—that the sign DOG could refer to any dog, FLOWER to any flower, SHOE to any shoe.&quot;

===Combinations of signs===
Washoe and her mates were allegedly able to combine the hundreds of signs that they learned into novel combinations (that they had never been taught, but rather created themselves) with different meanings. For instance, when Washoe&#x27;s mate Moja did not know the word for &quot;thermos&quot;, Moja referred to it as a &quot;METAL CUP DRINK.&quot; However, Washoe&#x27;s combinations were open to interpretation. Herbert S. Terrace contended that seeming sign combinations did not stand for a single item but rather represented three individual signs. Taking the thermos example, rather than METAL CUP DRINK being a composite meaning thermos, it could be that Washoe was indicating there was an item of metal (METAL), one shaped like a cup (CUP), and that could be drunk out of (DRINK).

==Self-awareness and emotion==
One of Washoe&#x27;s caretakers was pregnant and missed work for many weeks after she miscarried. Roger Fouts recounts the following situation:
Washoe herself lost two children. One baby chimpanzee died of a heart defect shortly after birth; the other baby, Sequoyah, died of a staph infection at two months of age.

When Washoe was shown an image of herself in the mirror, and asked what she was seeing, she replied: &quot;Me, Washoe.&quot; Primate expert Jane Goodall, who has studied and lived with chimpanzees for decades, believes that this might indicate some level of self-awareness. Washoe appeared to experience an identity crisis when she was first introduced to other chimpanzees, seeming shocked to learn that she was not the only chimpanzee. She gradually came to enjoy associating with other chimpanzees.

Washoe enjoyed playing pretend with her dolls, which she would bathe and talk to and would act out imaginary scenarios. She also spent time brushing her teeth, painting and taking tea parties.

When new students came to work with Washoe, she would slow down her rate of signing for novice speakers of sign language, which had a humbling effect on many of them.

==Quotes==
(In this section double quotes are signed by Washoe, single by someone else.)

* &quot;Peekaboo (i.e. hide and seek) I go&quot;
* &quot;Baby (doll) in my drink (i.e. cup)&quot; (when doll placed in her cup)
* &quot;Time Eat?&quot; and &quot;you me time eat?&quot;
* Asked &#x27;Who&#x27;s coming?&#x27; Responded &quot;Mrs G&quot; (correct).
* &quot;You, Me out go&quot;. &#x27;OK but first clothes&#x27; (Washoe puts on jacket.)
* &quot;Good, go&quot;, &#x27;Where Go&#x27;, &quot;You Me Peekaboo&quot;
* &#x27;What That&#x27; &quot;Shoe&quot; &#x27;Whose That Shoe&#x27; &quot;Yours&quot; &#x27;What color&#x27; &quot;Black&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Washoe was moved to Central Washington University in 1980. On October 30, 2007, officials from the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute on the CWU campus announced that she had died at the age of 42.

==Impact on bioethics==
Some believe that the fact that Washoe not only communicated, but also formed close and personal relationships with humans indicates that she was emotionally sensitive and deserving of moral status.

Work with Washoe and other signing primates motivated the foundation of the Great Ape Project, which hopes to &quot;include the non-human great apes: chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas within the community of equals by granting them the basic moral and legal protections that only humans currently enjoy&quot;, in order to place them in the moral category of &quot;persons&quot; rather than private property.

==Related animal language projects==

The publication of the Washoe experiments spurred a revival in the scholarly study of sign language, due to widespread interest in questions it raised about the biological roots of language. This included additional experiments which attempted to teach great apes to communicate in a more controlled environment.

In 1979, after Herbert Terrace and Thomas Bever&#x27;s Nim Chimpsky project failed to demonstrate a chimps&#x27; ability to use sentences, Terrace criticized Project Washoe as well. Drawing on public film clips of Washoe, Terrace questioned Washoe&#x27;s purported ability to create novel expressions and statements. He and Thomas Sebeok argued that the apparently impressive results may have amounted to nothing more than a &quot;Clever Hans&quot; effect.

Washoe&#x27;s advocates responded by pointing out a number of methodological problems with Terrace&#x27;s Nim study, issues later documented in Elizabeth Hess&#x27;s &quot;Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human&quot; and the documentary &quot;Project Nim&quot;.

<text>ChessBase is a German company that develops and sells chess software, maintains a chess news site, and operates an internet chess server for online chess. Founded in 1986, it maintains and sells large-scale databases containing the moves of recorded chess games. The databases contain data from prior games and provide engine analyses of games. Endgame tablebases are also provided by the company.

ChessBase&#x27;s Indian YouTube channel ChessBase India has amassed more than 2.5 million YouTube subscribers and more than 2.5 billion total views as of December 2024.

==History==
Starting in 1983, Frederic Friedel and his colleagues put out a magazine &quot;Computer-schach und Spiele&quot; covering the emerging hobby of computer chess. In 1985, Friedel invited then world chess champion Garry Kasparov to his house. Kasparov mused about how a chess database would make it easier for him to prepare for specific opponents. Friedel began working with Bonn physicist Matthias Wüllenweber who created the first such database, ChessBase 1.0, as software for the Atari ST. The February 1987 issue of &quot;Computer-schach und Spiele&quot; introduced the database program as well as the ChessBase magazine, a floppy disk containing chess games edited by chess grandmaster John Nunn.

The August 1991 issue of &quot;Computer-schach und Spiele&quot; announced that Dutch programmer Frans Morsch&#x27;s Fritz program would soon be available for purchase as software for PCs. This method of software sale was unlike all the dedicated chess computers which at the time dominated the ratings lists. This program was marketed initially as Knightstalker in the U.S., while it was marketed as Fritz in the rest of the world. Mathias Feist joined ChessBase, and ported Fritz to DOS and then Microsoft Windows.

In 1994, German chess grandmaster Rainer Knaak joined ChessBase as a full-time employee, annotating games for the ChessBase magazine, and soon authoring game database CD-ROMs on topics such as the Trompowsky Attack or Mating Attacks against 0-0. British grandmaster Daniel King was another early author of such CD-ROMs which eventually grew into the Fritztrainer series of multimedia DVDs.

In the mid-1990s, R&amp;D Publishing in the U.S. released a series of print books in the ChessBase University Opening Series, including Karpov and Alexander Beliavsky&#x27;s &quot;The Caro-Kann in Black and White&quot;.

In December 1996, ChessBase added Mark Uniacke&#x27;s Hiarcs 6 chess engine to its product line up, selling it inside the existing Fritz graphical user interface (GUI). In March 1998, ChessBase added Junior 4.6 and Dr. Christian Donninger&#x27;s Nimzo99. Also that year, ChessBase released Fritz 5 including a &#x27;friend mode&#x27; which would automatically scale its strength of play down to the level that it assessed the player was playing. This remains a feature of all of ChessBase&#x27;s graphical user interfaces.

In 1998, ChessBase took their database of chess games online. In November, ChessBase started offering trainer CD-ROMs by such grandmasters as Robert Hübner, Rainer Knaak and Daniel King.

In 1999, Stefan Meyer-Kahlen&#x27;s Shredder had won the world computer chess championship. In April, Meyer-Kahlen and Huber released the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol for engines to communicate with GUIs, to compete with Winboard and ChessBase. Meyer-Kahlen&#x27;s contract with Millennium 2000 expired in June, and ChessBase hired him shortly after, adding Shredder to their product line under a Fritz style GUI, and giving their new GUIs the ability to import UCI engines.

In April 2000, ChessBase released a Young Talents CD featuring the engines Anmon, Goliath Light, Gromit, Ikarus, Patzer, Phalanx and Rudolf Huber&#x27;s SOS. Christophe Theron&#x27;s engines Chess Tiger and Gambit Tiger were also released as ChessBase engines that month.

In the early 2000s matches were held pitting world champions Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik against versions of the Fritz or Junior engines.

In 2003, ChessBase introduced the Chess Media System, allowing players to produce videos with them playing out moves that can be seen on the user&#x27;s chessboard within a ChessBase program. Eventually, ChessBase commissioned world champions Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik and Rustam Kasimdzhanov to produce DVDs using the new format. ChessBase also produced Fritztrainer Opening DVDs by the likes of grandmasters Alexei Shirov and Viktor Bologan and a Power Play series by British grandmaster Daniel King for lower level players.

In April 2006, following its victory at the World Computer Chess Championship, Anthony Cozzie&#x27;s Zappa chess engine was published by ChessBase as &quot;Zap!Chess&quot;.

In 2008, Vasik Rajlich&#x27;s Rybka engine was added to the ChessBase product line, followed by Robert Houdart&#x27;s Houdini and Don Dailey and Larry Kaufman&#x27;s Komodo engines.

Recent versions of ChessBase and the engine GUIs such as Fritz supports cloud engines. ChessBase/Playchess added a web interface by 2013. ChessBase added a tactics trainer web app in 2015. In 2015, ChessBase released a play Fritz web app, as well as My Games for storing one&#x27;s games.

==The company==
The company is located in Hamburg, Germany. ChessBaseUSA markets their products in the United States, and some of their most popular programs are sold by licensee Viva Media, a division of Encore, Inc. In 1998, the German company Data Becker released the program 3D Schach Genie, containing the Shredder engine and Fritz interface. ChessBase India markets their products in India and surrounding countries. ChessBase India is run by International Master(IM) Sagar Shah and his wife Amruta Mokal.

==The database==
ChessBase was originally designed for the Atari ST by Matthias Wüllenweber, the physicist/co-founder of the company. Mathias Feist helped port the program to DOS. In more recent years, Lutz Nebe, Wolfgang Haar and Jeroen van den Belt have also been involved in program development.
ChessBase uses a proprietary format for storing games (CBH), but can also handle games in portable game notation (PGN). The proprietary format uses less hard drive space and manages information that is not possible in PGN. The software converts files from PGN to ChessBase format, or from ChessBase to PGN.

The program permits searches for games, and positions in games, based on player names, openings, some tactical and strategic motifs, material imbalance, and features of the position. ChessBase can import engines either those such as Fritz or Shredder in native ChessBase format or Universal Chess Interface (UCI) engines such as Stockfish.

, ChessBase&#x27;s database contained over 8.4 million games. The online database can be accessed directly through their database programs.

==Playchess server==

Playchess is an internet chess service where players can play chess with other players and discuss about chess.

==News site==
ChessBase also maintains ChessBase News, a web site containing chess news, as well as information on their products. The site is available in English, German, Spanish and Hindi.

==Other publications==
ChessBase produces CDs and DVDs, including monographs on famous players, tactical training exercises, and training for specific opening systems. They publish the &quot;ChessBase Magazine&quot; six times per year, which comes on DVD with video clip interviews, articles on opening novelties, database updates (including annotated games), and other articles. All these are designed for viewing within their database software or the free ChessBase Reader.

==Related computer programs==

A database-only version of ChessBase for the BBC Micro, called &quot;BBChessBase&quot;, was published by Peter Tate in 1991.

Gerritt Reubold&#x27;s Der Bringer chess program is a rare example of a ChessBase format engine not released by ChessBase itself.

==Criticism and legal issues==
ChessBase has faced criticism for allegedly using free software created by others without credit. The developers of Stockfish, an open-source chess engine, charged that Fat Fritz 2 is a modified copy of their software (that had originally been uncredited; since rectified) and that ChessBase claims &quot;originality where there is none&quot;. Lichess described the same product as &quot;a rip-off&quot;.

ChessBase responded to this criticism by adding references but claiming the new engine differs from Stockfish due to added input from the original Fat Fritz neural network—itself claimed by Lichess to be derived closely from Leela Chess Zero, another open-source initiative.

In July 2021, Stockfish sued ChessBase, alleging that ChessBase violated Stockfish&#x27;s GNU General Public License. In November 2022, a settlement on that lawsuit was reached.

<text>The Jaeger Corps also known as the Huntsmen Corps () is an elite special operations force of the Danish Armed Forces part of Special Operations Command, formerly of the Royal Danish Army, based at Aalborg Air Base.

==History==
The Jaeger Corps traces its origins to 1785 when the corps was first formed as the &quot;Jaeger Corps of Zealand&quot;. Facing emerging threats from Sweden, Prussia, and Great Britain, Denmark created a light infantry force from hunters and woodsmen. The corps existed in various forms until it was remade in its current form in 1962 when Major P.B. Larsen and First Lieutenant Jørgen Lyng became the first two to complete the training.

Throughout the Cold War, the Jaegers&#x27; primary tasking was that of a long-range reconnaissance unit, with wide renown for their skills in parachute operations. In the post-Cold War era, the Jaegers deployed for the first time in 1995 to Sarajevo with a six-man counter-sniper team.

Following the September 11 terrorist attacks and the beginning of the United States invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the Jaegers&#x27; training programme changed. As such, the Jaegers increased their proficiency in counter-terrorism skills, while still maintaining their excellence at reconnaissance operations.

In 2002, the Jaegers were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Danish contribution (Task Group Ferret) to Task Force K-Bar, along with the Frogman Corps. During these operations, the Jaegers took part in reconnaissance, observations, capturing of high-value targets, and direct-action raids on Taliban and al-Qaeda positions. As part of Task Force K-Bar, the Jaeger Corps was awarded the American Presidential Unit Citation on 7 December 2004 for its effort as part of the joint special operations task force in Afghanistan.

The first Jaeger to be killed in combat was in 2013 when a Jaeger was hit by an explosion in Afghanistan. Four Jaegers had previously died during training accidents.

==Selection and training==
The selection course to become a Jaeger is very demanding, both mentally and physically. To be accepted into the Corps, a candidate must complete the following:
* Pre-course 1 (5 days)
:Introduces the candidate to the subjects covered in the patrol course, and identifies the areas in which the candidate must improve (orienteering, swimming, etc.).
* Pre-course 2 (2 days)
:More training and evaluation in the above covered subjects.
* Pre-course 3 (2 days)
:More training and evaluation in the above covered subjects with tougher requirements.
* Patrol Course (8 weeks)
:Basic medical, demolition, and marksmanship using basic direct-action and special reconnaissance training events to assess candidates. This course must be completed at a satisfactory level to continue to the aspirant course.
* Selection Course (8 weeks)
:Candidates receive training in advanced breaching, close-quarters battle, demolition, and sniping. If passed the candidate is awarded his or her &quot;bugle&quot; for the beret.
* Basic parachuting course (2 weeks)
* Combat Swimming Course (2 weeks)

Approximately 10% of candidates successfully complete the program and become a full member of the Jaeger Corps. The successful Jaeger continues in the training wing for individual training during their first (probationary) year. During this time they will receive High Altitude Parachute Operations (HAPO) training in High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) and High Altitude High Opening (HAHO), environmental training (desert and winter), advanced infiltration training (mountain, nontactical vehicle, ski and rotary-wing), attain Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) certification, and gain additional communications skills. New Jaeger Corps members are also taught a hand-to-hand combat system called MTM (man-to-man) combat, which was developed in 1992 by Peter Hedegaard in collaboration with two of the Corps&#x27;s own close-combat instructors.

==Insignia and status==
The Jaeger Corps wear a frogberet also and the maroon beret with a brass emblem depicting a hunter&#x27;s bugle on a black felt liner. After one year of satisfactory service and training in corps the wearer is issued the shoulder patch &quot;JÆGER&quot; and may call himself by this name. The unit&#x27;s insignia features a hunting horn from their origin as hunters and woodsmen.

The Jaeger Corps is composed of around 150 highly trained soldiers with special expertise in counter-terrorism, demolitions, parachuting, and combat swimming, HAHO and HALO parachuting, infiltration, sabotage, reconnaissance and more. The corps regularly trains with similar units from different countries, such as the US Navy SEALs, US Army DELTA, British SAS and the Danish naval special forces group, the Frogman Corps. The corps is based on the structure and modus operandi of the British SAS.

Their slogan, which is Latin, &quot;Plus esse, quam simultatur&quot; translates to &quot;Hellere at være, end at synes&quot; (&quot;Rather to be, than to seem&quot;) in Danish, meaning that the soldier&#x27;s capabilities do not have to be widely recognized or boasted—they are only more effective if unknown.

==International Joint Training==
Like most western Special Operations Forces, the Jaegers regularly take part in joint training operations with other NATO and Coalition SOFs. These exercises include reconnaissance patrols throughout Europe, arctic survival training, helicopter insertion techniques, parachute insertion techniques, hostage rescue training, Close Air Support training, medical training, and other SOF-specific skills.

Allied units as the Jaegers regularly practice with include:
* US Army Special Forces
* US Navy SEALs
* US Army Delta Force
* 22nd Special Air Service Regiment
* Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK)
* Särskilda operationsgruppen
* Kommando Spezialkräfte
* Army Ranger Battalion
* Netherlands Special Operations Command
* Special Operations Regiment (Belgium)

<text>Daniel Heinsius (or Heins) (9 June 158025 February 1655) was one of the most famous scholars of the Dutch Renaissance.

==His youth and student years==
Heinsius was born in Ghent. The troubles of the Spanish war drove his parents to settle first at Veere in Zeeland, then to England, next at Rijwijk and lastly at Vlissingen. In 1596, being already remarkable for his attainments, he was sent to the University of Franeker to study law under Henricus Schotanus. In 1598, he settled at Leiden for the nearly sixty remaining years of his life. There he studied under Joseph Scaliger, and there he met Marnix de St Aldegonde, Janus Dousa, Paulus Merula, Hugo Grotius and others; he was soon taken into the society of these celebrated men as their equal.

==Professor at Leiden University==
His proficiency in the classical languages won the praise of all the best scholars of Europe, and offers were made to him, but in vain, to accept honourable positions outside Holland. He soon rose in dignity at the University of Leiden. In 1602, he started lecturing, in 1603 he was appointed professor of poetics, in 1605 professor of Greek, and at the death of Merula in 1607 he succeeded that illustrious scholar as the 4th librarian of Leiden University Library. In 1612, he was appointed as &#x27;Professor Politices&#x27;, the world&#x27;s first chair in political science. Through his ties with Naudé and others of the circle of De Thou then enjoying Papal favour, Heinsius began corresponding with Barberini’s protégés Giovanni Battista Doni, Professor of Greek at Florence, Bartolomeo Tortoletti, the poet and theologian, Baldassarre Bonifacio, honoured for his learning both in Rome and Venice, and Lucas Holstenius, a former student of Heinsius’ at Leiden, now in the Cardinal’s service. Pope Urban VIII made him great offers if he would settle at Rome, but he preferred remaining at Leiden.

As a classical scholar Heinsius edited many Latin and Greek classical as well as patristic authors, amongst others: Hesiod (1603), Theocritus, Bion of Smyrna and Moschus (1603), Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Ars poetica&quot; (1611), Publius Ovidius Naso&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Clement of Alexandria (1616) and Terentius (1618). He brought out the Epistles of Joseph Scaliger in 1627.

Especially influential was his treatise &quot;De tragica constitutione&quot; (&quot;How to make a tragedy&quot;, 1611). It was a personal and easily accessible version of what Aristotle had written on tragedy in his &quot;Poetics&quot;. A revised edition appeared in 1643 with a slightly different title: &quot;De constitutione tragoediae&quot;.
In 1609, he printed a first edition of his Latin orations. Ever more voluminous new editions appeared until the final edition of 1642 which comprised 35 orations. The collection ended with the ironical &quot;Laus pediculi&quot; (&quot;In praise of the louse&quot;), which was translated in English by James Guitard in 1634.

==Latin poetry==
Heinsius first drew attention to himself as a Latin poet with his Senecan tragedy &quot;Auriacus, sive libertas saucia&quot; (&quot;William of Orange, or Freedom Wounded&quot;). In 1607/08, he wrote another tragedy, &quot;Herodes infanticida&quot; (&quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot;), which was published only in 1632. He was, however, especially prolific in writing elegies, of which a large part was dedicated to his love for a girl called Rossa. A first collection appeared in 1603. Ever larger and revised collections of his &quot;Poemata&quot;, also containing other genres, saw the light regularly. By 1628 he had contributed a Latin poem praising the renowned fencer Gerard Thibault to the front of his book &quot;Academie de L&#x27;espee&quot;.

==Dutch poetry==
In 1601, he published, under the pseudonym of Theocritus à Ganda (&quot;Theocritus from Ghent&quot;), &quot;Quaeris quid sit Amor...?&quot; (&quot;Do you ask what love is?&quot;), the first emblem book in Dutch. It was re-edited in 1606/07 with the title &quot;Emblemata amatoria&quot; (&quot;Love emblems&quot;). A second emblem book, &quot;Spiegel vande doorluchtige vrouwen&quot; (&quot;Mirror of illustrious women&quot;), was published in 1606. Heinsius also experimented in Dutch poetry after classical models. His efforts were collected by his friend Petrus Scriverius and published as &quot;Nederduytsche poemata&quot; (&quot;Dutch poems&quot;) in 1616. They were greatly admired by Martin Opitz, who, in translating the poetry of Heinsius, introduced the German public to the use of the rhyming alexandrine.

==His later years==
In 1617, he married Ermgard Rutgers, sister of Janus Rutgersius (alias of Mr. Johan Rutgers 1589-1625) one of Scaliger&#x27;s favorite pupils. They had two children: Nicolas (1620), who was to become a famous Latin poet and book collector, and Elizabeth (1623). At the Synod of Dort (1618-1619), Heinsius was secretary on behalf of the States General. Afterwards, he paid more attention to theology and worked on the text of the Greek New Testament for Elzevier&#x27;s edition (1624, 1633). In these years, he also wrote a large didactic poem, &quot;De contemptu mortis&quot; (&quot;On the contempt of death&quot;, 1621), which has a Christian-Stoical content. His wife died in 1633, and Heinsius got into a conflict with Claudius Salmasius, who was appointed as his colleague in 1631. He became more and more lonely and embittered. He stopped lecturing in 1647. He died in The Hague, aged 74, and was buried in Leiden.
He collected some Greek manuscripts, e.g. codex 155.

<text>Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde, Lord of West-Souburg (Dutch: Filips van Marnix, heer van Sint-Aldegonde, heer van West-Souburg, French: Philippe de Marnix, seigneur de Sainte-Aldegonde; 7 March/20 July 1540 – 15 December 1598) was a Flemish and Dutch writer and statesman, and the probable author of the text of the Dutch national anthem, the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;.

==Biography - career==

Marnix of St. Aldegonde was born in Brussels, the son of Jacob of Marnix. He studied theology under John Calvin and Theodore Beza at Geneva. Returning to the Habsburg Netherlands in 1560, he threw himself into the cause of the Reformation, taking an active part in the compromise of the nobles in 1565 and the assembly of Sint-Truiden. He issued a pamphlet in justification of the iconoclastic movement Beeldenstorm which devastated many churches in Flanders in 1566, and on the Duke of Alba&#x27;s arrival next year had to flee the country.

After spending some time in Friesland and in the Electorate of the Palatinate he was in 1570 taken into the service of William, prince of Orange, and in 1572 was sent as his representative to the first meeting of the States-General assembled at Dordrecht. In 1573 he was taken prisoner by the Spaniards at Maaslandsluys, but was exchanged in the following year. He was sent as the representative of the insurgent provinces to Paris and London, where he attempted in vain to secure the effective assistance of Queen, Elizabeth I of England.

In 1578 he was at the Diet of Worms, where he made an eloquent, but fruitless, appeal for aid to the German princes. Equally vain were his efforts in the same year to persuade the magistrates of Ghent to cease persecuting the Catholics in the city. He took a conspicuous part in arranging the Union of Utrecht. In 1583 was chosen burgomaster of Antwerp. In 1585 he surrendered the city, after the months&#x27; Siege of Antwerp, to the Spaniards. Attacked by the English and by his own countrymen for this act, he retired from public affairs and, save for a mission to Paris in 1590, lived henceforth in Leiden or on his estate in Zeeland, where he worked at a translation of the Bible.

His daughter Elizabeth married Sir Charles Morgan, a Welsh mercenary serving with the Dutch States Army who ended his career as Governor of Bergen op Zoom. He died in Leiden on 15 December 1598.

==Literary work==
St. Aldegonde, or Marnix (by which name he is very commonly known), is celebrated for his share in the great development of Dutch literature which followed the classical period represented by such writers as the poet and historian Pieter Hooft. Of his works, the best known is the &quot;Roman Bee-hive&quot; (&quot;De roomsche byen-korf&quot;), published in 1569 during his exile in Friesland, a bitter satire on the faith and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. This was translated, or adapted, in French, German and English (by George Gilpin). He also wrote an educational treatise dedicated to John, Count of Nassau. As a poet, St. Aldegonde is mainly known through his metrical translation of the Psalms (1580/1591); and, the Dutch national anthem &quot;Wilhelmus van Nassouwe&quot; is also ascribed to him. His complete works, edited by Lacroix and Quinet, were published at Brussels in 7 volumes (1855–1859), and his religious and theological writings, edited by Van Toorenenbergen, at The Hague, in 4 volumes (1871–1891).

Marnix wrote one of the earliest Bible translations into Dutch.

Less known to the general public is his work as a cryptographer. St. Aldegonde is considered to be the first Dutch cryptographer (cfr. &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;). For Stadholder William the Silent, he deciphered secret messages that were intercepted from the Spaniards. His interest in cryptography possibly shows in the &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;, where the first letters of the couplets form the name &quot;Willem van Nassov&quot;, i.e. William &#x27;the Silent&#x27; of Nassau, the Prince of Orange, but such acrostics - and far more intricate poetic devices - were a common feature of the Rederijker school in the Lowlands.

There is a marble sculpture of him by Paul de Vigne in Brussels.

Marnix could speak Spanish, and this influenced his writing style.

<text>Paul Lacroix (; 27 February 1806 – 16 October 1884) was a French author and journalist. He is known best by his pseudonym P.L. Jacob, [[bibliophile]], or Bibliophile Jacob, suggested by his great interest in libraries and books generally.

== Biography ==
Lacroix was born in Paris, the son of a novelist. He was a prolific and varied writer, composing more than twenty historical romances and a variety of serious historical works, including histories of Napoleon III and of the Czar Nicholas I of Russia.

He was the joint author with Ferdinand Séré of a five-volume work, &quot;Le moyen âge et la renaissance&quot; (1847), a profusely illustrated standard work on the manners, customs and dress of the Renaissance. He also wrote many monographs on phases of the history of culture, including Manners, Custom and Dress During the Middle Ages and During the Renaissance Period. Someone using the name Pierre Dufour published an exhaustive six-volume &quot;Histoire de la prostitution&quot; (1851–1854), which has always been attributed to Lacroix. His works concerning bibliography were also numerous, as was his periodical &quot;Revue universelle des arts&quot; [Universal Review of the Arts], which he initiated in 1855. In 1855 he was appointed librarian of the Arsenal Library, Paris.

He married Apolline Biffe on 7 May 1834. She lived with Paul Lacroix&#x27;s collaborator, art collector Théophile Thoré-Bürger, for more than a decade until his death.

<text>Martin Opitz von Boberfeld (23 December 1597 – 20 August 1639) was a German poet, regarded as the greatest of that nation during his lifetime.

==Biography==
Opitz was born in Bunzlau (Bolesławiec) in Lower Silesia, in the Principality of Schweidnitz-Jauer, the son of a prosperous citizen. He received his early education at the gymnasium of his native town, of which his uncle was rector, and in 1617 attended the high school—&quot;Schönaichianum&quot;—at Beuthen an der Oder (Bytom Odrzański), where he made a special study of French, Dutch and Italian poetry. In 1618 he entered the University of Frankfurt-on-Oder as a student of &quot;literae humaniores&quot;, and in the same year published his first essay, &quot;Aristarchus, sive De contemptu linguae Teutonicae&quot;, which presented the German language as suitable for poetry.

In 1619 Opitz went to Heidelberg, where he became the leader of the school of young poets which at that time made that university town remarkable. Visiting Leiden in the following year he sat at the feet of the famous Dutch lyric poet Daniel Heinsius (1580–1655), whose &quot;Lobgesang Jesu Christi&quot; and &quot;Lobgesang Bacchi&quot; he had already translated into alexandrines. At the invitation of Gabriel Bethlen, the lord of Transylvania, he spent a year (1622) as professor of philosophy at the gymnasium of Weißenburg (Alba Iulia). After this he led a wandering life in the service of various territorial nobles.

In 1624 Opitz was appointed councilor to Duke George Rudolf of Liegnitz (Legnica) and Brieg (Brzeg) in Silesia, and in 1625, as reward for a requiem poem composed on the death of Archduke Charles of Austria, was crowned poet laureate by Emperor Ferdinand II, who a few years later ennobled him under the title &quot;von Boberfeld.&quot; He was elected a member of the Fruitbearing Society in 1629, and in 1630 he went to Paris, where he made the acquaintance of Hugo Grotius. He settled in 1635 in the Hanseatic city of Danzig (Gdańsk) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland made him his historiographer and secretary. There he died of the plague on 20 August 1639 in Danzig.

Opitz was the head of the so-called First Silesian School of poets, and was during his life regarded as the greatest German poet. Although he would not today be considered a poetical genius, he may justly claim to have been the &quot;father of German poetry&quot; in respect at least of its form; his &quot;Buch von der deutschen Poeterey&quot; (1624) put an end to the hybridism that had until then prevailed, and established rules for the &quot;purity&quot; of language, style, verse and rhyme.

Opitz&#x27;s own poems are in accordance with the rigorous rules which he laid down. They are mostly a formal and sober elaboration of carefully considered themes, and contain little beauty and less feeling. To this didactic and descriptive category belong his best poems, &quot;Trost-Gedichte in Widerwärtigkeit des Krieges&quot; (written 1621, but not published until 1633); &quot;Zlatna&quot;, &quot;oder von der Ruhe des Gemüths&quot; (1622); &quot;Lob des Feldlebens&quot; (1623); &quot;Vielgut, oder vom wahren Glück&quot; (1629), and &quot;Vesuvius&quot; (1633). These contain some vivid poetical descriptions, but are in the main treatises in poetical form.

In 1624 Opitz published a collected edition of his poetry under the title &quot;Acht Bücher deutscher Poematum&quot; (though, owing to a mistake on the part of the printer, there are only five books); his &quot;Dafne&quot; (1627), to which Heinrich Schütz composed the music, is the earliest German opera. In 1637 (printed at Danzig in 1638) he dedicated the &quot;Geistliche Poemata&quot; (Religious Poems) to the Duchess of Silesia &quot;Der Durchlauchtigen Hochgebornen Fürstin und Frawen/ Frawen Sibyllen Margarethen, gebornen Hertzogin in Schlesien/ zur Lignitz und Briegk: Vermähleten deß Heiligen Röm. Reichs Gräffin von Dönhoff... Dantzig/den6.Tag deß intermonats/im 1637. Jahr.&quot; Sibylle Margarethe was the daughter of Dorothea of Brandenburg and the wife of Gerhard Dönhoff, brother of Ernst Magnus Dönhoff and Kasper Dönhoff.

In 1625 he lived in Wittenberg in Saxony.

Besides numerous translations, Opitz edited (1639) &quot;Das Annolied&quot;, a Middle High German poem of the end of the 11th century, and thus preserved it from oblivion since the original manuscript is now lost. Opitz also wrote a pastoral novel, &quot;Schäferei der Nymphe Hercinie&quot; (The Idyll of the Nymph Hercinie, 1630).

Opitz died in Danzig on 20 August 1639.

<text>Roger Morrice (1628–1702) was an English Puritan minister and political journalist. He is most noted for his &quot;Entring Book&quot;, a manuscript diary which provides a description of society in the years 1677 to 1691. The manuscript is held by Dr Williams&#x27;s Library in London, and in 2007 the Boydell Press published a six-volume edition of the text.

==Biography==
Little is known about Morrice&#x27;s life. He was born in about 1628 and died in 1702. He studied at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and later became the vicar of Duffield in Derbyshire in 1658. Because of his Non-conformist views he was ejected from his living at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, going on to become a private chaplain to Denzil Holles and John Maynard, both veteran Parliamentarians.

Though Morrice reveals virtually nothing about himself in his diaries, his &quot;Entring Book&quot; is a particularly useful source document for London life and politics from the late 1670s to the early 1690s – as informative, in its own way, as the better known &quot;Diaries&quot; of Samuel Pepys. Morrice himself was a puritan clergyman who became a close associate of those opposed to the forms of absolute government favoured by the later Stuart kings, Charles II and his brother and successor, the Catholic James II. Most of the early part of the &quot;Entring Book&quot; is concerned with the possible impact of resurgent Catholicism on English liberties. For Morrice, the Tories, the party of the Court, were not so much a rival to the Whigs, with whom he identified, but &#x27;conspiracy against the Reformed interest.&#x27; After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which James was replaced by William III and Mary II, Morrice is anxious to detect signs of Jacobitism in the ranks of those whom he refers to as &#x27;the hierarchical party.&#x27;

Besides high politics, Morrice&#x27;s journal has a lot to say about other aspects of contemporary life: from military and legal affairs, to printing, firework carnivals, storms, hurricanes, duels, executions, suicides and many other similar delights.
